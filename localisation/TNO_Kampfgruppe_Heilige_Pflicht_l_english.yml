 POLITICS_Joachim_Peiper_DESC:0 "My honour is called loyalty. My duty is called loyalty. My duty calls to my blood. My blood calls to the Reichsführer-SS.\n\nHimmler's Inner Circle is not an easy order to find oneself in. However, SS-Brigadeführer Joachim Peiper managed to achieve just that, through scrutiny by some and praise by others. Born right into the heart of the middle of the First World War within the burning heart of the German Empire itself, Berlin. Peiper quickly attracted the likeness of the soon-to-be Reichsführer-SS, who admired the young recruit's Aryan features so much that he was forwarded to SS Leadership training. From those halls would birth the Ravager of the East, the monster who would lead the "Blowtorch Battalion" through Kharkov and into atrocity after atrocity. And with the Reich's victory would come more massacres for the Beast of Berlin.\n\nAs the Reich brought upon a new era of dominance and success, Peiper found himself becoming further engrossed with the esoteric propagandas of the Schutzstaffel, as the dedicated National Socialist came to praise Peiper as a goal, some ideal to achieve. Nevertheless, the Reichsführer-SS held his prized possession close, allowing for Peiper to receive a massive promotion for all of his "duties in the field of combat and leadership, in the recognition to dedication towards the annihilation of degeneracy, and the establishment of a new National Socialist era." Thus, as the celebrity combatant kicked back with a seemingly secure position in the SS-Ordenstaat Burgund, Peiper believed that all had turned out well.\n\nAnd, yet, the horrors facing the Reich could never be more dire. With Peiper's former ally, Reinhard Heydrich, now denouncing and rebelling against the Reichsführer-SS, the Butcher of Berlin stands as a meat grinder against all those traitorous cowards refusing the Reichsführer-SS in their attempts to flee to the South, as the bitter, frozen Austrian winter grows colder by the day..."

 KHP_bloodstained_legacy_desc:0 "Even within the SS, Peiper's command is infamous for its refusal to show quarter, as well as regular massacres of both civilians and POWs. Feared and hated by both the Wehrmacht remnants and civilians, Peiper can expect short shrift if his situation turns sour."
 
 KHP_eagles_nest:0 "Eagle's Nests"
 KHP_eagles_nest_desc:0 "Situated in the Austrian Alps, Peiper's Kampfgruppe is in a very favorable defensive position. Peiper is an expert commander of armor and infantry alike; the terrain will prove no obstacle to his units should the fight come to them."
