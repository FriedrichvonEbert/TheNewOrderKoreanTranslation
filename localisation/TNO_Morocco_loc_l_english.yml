POLITICS_HASSAN_II_DESC:0 "Hassan II is the successor to the late Mohammad V for the Kingdom of Morocco. In the same vein as his father, Hassan has used the unstable situation in Iberia as leverage to increase his own power as ruler. Hassan has been able to receive the education necessary to rule, be it the formal education from his studies at the Royal Academy in Rabat or the martial education from his time leading army contingents against the rebels that resided in the mountains of the Rif. Already, he has announced his plans for a policy he refers to as "Moroccanisation" in which state-held assets that are majority foreign owned will be transferred to "friends of the Moroccan people" which has received very vocal support from the nationalists in the country.\n\nDeclared by many as an autocrat and an absolute monarch under the Iberians, Hassan has seized the opportunity to declare Morocco an independent state and has annexed West Sahara and Mauritania much to the chagrin of the locals. In addition, the declaration of the Rif republic shows that Hassan's fiefdom faces a great amount of opposition that will require a strong hand to defeat. Now, the future of Morocco seems to lie entirely in his hands as the central authority within the Kingdom but whether such a ruler, whose focus resides in increasing and maintaining his own power rather than addressing the variety of problems that plague his subjects, will be able to lead his country will be lay bare in the years to come."
