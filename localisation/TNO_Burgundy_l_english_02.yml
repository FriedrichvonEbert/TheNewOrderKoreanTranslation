 BRG_collapse.1.desc:0 "역사를 보면 서양 문명의 발흥과 몰락은 똑딱이는 시계에 달려있었습니다. 남자와 여자, 어린이의 죽음에서부터 세계 전역의 왕국과 제국에 이르기까지 이 모든 것은 시계가 지배하는 것으로, 이 소리는 우리 발 앞에 무릎을 꿇어야 할 수많은 열등인간의 삶과 심장 박동을 형성하는 동시에 시간을 엄수하는 아리아인의 마음 속에 울려 퍼집니다. 진정으로 훌륭한 인물조차도 우주 시계의 똑딱 소리는 원수에 대항하는 우월한 사람의 피와 유전자 내에 계속 새겨진다는 것을 알고 있습니다.\n\n그리고 오늘날, 이 우월한 사람들은 세계와 전쟁을 벌이고 있으며, 기사단국의 강력한 전사들은 이 시계의 자비를 발견하고, 기사단국 그 자체는 역사에서 주인의 힘을 깨닫고 있습니다. 오늘날, 프랑스인은 삼색기를 흔들면서 공화주의와 민주주의의 필요성을 외치고, 영원한 지배의 의미인 것마냥 흉악한 수준의 부패에 빠져있습니다. 오늘날, 벨기에인은 24시간 내내 북방을 맴돌며 민주적 민족주의라는 소름끼치는 미명하에 야만적인 이웃이라 생각하는 플란데른인과 함께 정착한 아리안인을 살해하고 있습니다. 그리고 오늘날 과거 종교의 메시지가 비참한 "신앙"을 위해 충직하고 빈틈없는 시민들을 벗겨내려고 하면서, 나약한 가톨릭 신자는 꽃과 유대사회주의에 대한 징그럽고 기형적인 환상을 보며 시계를 부술려고 하고 있습니다. \n\n이 반역자들과 어울리는 모든 남자, 여자, 그리고 아이는 그들 자신의 사형 집행 영장에 서명하여 우주 시계가 준 시간을 멈추게 했습니다. 몇몇은 기사단국과 열전을 벌이기 위해 일어섰고, 우리는 이 세계를 지배하는 진정한 주인입니다. SS국가지도자는 명철함과 지혜 속에서 군대가 어느 쪽을 겨냥해야 할지 선택할 필요성을 인식했고, 똑딱거리는 시계의 축복 아래 우리에게 주어진 영광을 얻을 수 있었습니다."

 BRG_collapse.3.d:0 "첫날은 기쁨과 흥분이 가득했다. 그날 밤에는 슈츠슈타펠 연대와 그 장교들은 치명적인 공격을 받아 붕괴되었으며, 결국 민중은 하나의 대혁명으로 연합하였다. 우리는 함께 그들을 영토 밖으로 밀어내고, 우리 스스로 국가를 만들었다. 유럽 장교처럼 강경하고 전통적인 대령조차도 우리를 오랫동안 학살한 아리아인들을 상대로 군사적 성공을 거둔 것을 기념하기 위해 와인을 마시고 즐기는 것을 마다하지 않았다. \n\n그러나 전쟁이 진행되면서 그 첫 날의 기쁨은 시들해졌다. 전쟁이 지속될수록 수많은 사람이 죽었으며, 아리아인을 계속 밀어내는 동안 그들이 퇴각 후 남겨둔 그을리고 황폐해진 대지 위에서 피로감을 느끼지 않을 수 없었다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 우리는 아리아 브루탈리즘과 폭정에 지배되고 있는 위대한 시골의 잔해와 폐허를 지나 여정을 계속했다. 그 곳에서는 모든 유용한 공급 기지나 잠재적 라디오 기지가 박살나고 불탔다. 식량과 수원은 날이 갈수록 부족해졌고, 적의 퇴각 뒤에 남겨진 파괴에 따른 물자와 지원의 부족은 우리 대열의 내분으로 이어졌다. 완전히 파괴된 또 다른 잠재적 자원을 지나갈 때마다 피로는 더욱 커져만 갔다. \n\n돌이켜보면, 그 모든 것은 지금에 비하면 너무나 간단해 보인다. 파괴가 너무 심해져서 우리는 그저 계속 검게 그을린 폐허를 마주하게 되었는데, 그 곳은 일상적인 삶이 진행되는 곳이라기보다는 베르덩이나 솜의 전쟁터처럼 보였다. 거기서 우리는 참호를 팠다. 그리고 검은 태양이 일어났을 때도 있었다. 짐승의 파도가 움직이기 전 기관총이 지옥을 퍼부었다. 적에게 굴복한 옛 전우들이 구식 소총, 폭발물, 동포를 도살할 때 쓰던 참호용 단검 등 단순한 무기를 들고 우리 대열로 달려들었다. 이제 대령은 이 참호에서 내 옆에 누워 있다. 총에 맞은 그의 두개골에서 피가 흘러나와 내 입속에 고여가고 있다. 이제, 내가 할 수 있는 일은 여기서 죽은 척 하는 것이다. 적이 짐승처럼 우리를 샅샅이 뒤지지만, 나는 그들이 내 심장 박동 소리를 듣지 않기를 바랄 뿐이다."

 BRG_collapse.4.d:0 "일이 항상 이런 식인 것만은 아니었습니다. 무장친위대에서 가장 큰 집단의 사령관으로 임명되는 것은 기사단국 내에서 진정한 영광입니다. 그러나 영광스러운 성공이 국가와 SS국가지도자에 대한 명예를 의미하는 경우에는, 끔찍한 시기에는 그러한 성공에서 멀어지는 게 더 낫습니다. 그러한 성공은 오히려 실망을 안겨줄 것이고, 그러한 실망은 모든 죽음이 기사단국에 큰 손실이 되는 현재 전장의 상황을 감안할 때 때아닌 죽음을 초래할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 파이퍼는 쉽게 죽지 않을 것입니다. 아니, 그는 죽지 않을 것입니다. 만약 그의 계획이 친위대 앞에서 효과가 있다면 말입니다. \n\n한때 국가사회주의라는 이름으로 새로운 성공을 거두었다는 소식에 자부심과 만족감으로 밝게 빛났던 방은, 이제 폭풍과 하늘을 날아다니는 재에 가려져 어두워졌습니다. SS국가지도자의 집무실 입구에서 대화가 이어졌습니다. 대화는 우리의 성공, 아리아인 전통주의, 지도력 변화, 군사 교리, 실패 등 여러 주제를 다루었습니다. 여단지도자가 승리의 대가를 회고하며 새로운 생각을 앞으로 밀고 나갔기 때문에, 이 만남의 진정한 의미는 결국 사라지게 될 것입니다. 승리는 아리아인 병사의 피를 통해 이루어지기보다는 우리 산업과 추진 기술, 탄두를 통해 이루어집니다. \n\n그리고 여단지도자는 현재 처한 상황을 깨닫기 시작했습니다. 네 명의 남자가 돌격소총을 들고 여단지도자의 머리통을 날려버리기 위해 트럭을 둘러쌌기 때문입니다. 이는 파이퍼가 자신의 미래를 위해 바랐던 상황이 아닐 것이요, 그가 전쟁터의 쾌락과 입술에 묻은 열등인종의 피맛을 즐기는 것을 바랐던 것은 아닐 것입니다. 오히려 그는 이 전쟁의 다음 단계를 준비하기 위해 모든 핵무기 시설을 무사히 순회하기를 바랬을 것입니다."

 BRG_collapse.14.d:0 "Turonen had become the pinnacle of Aryan brutalist desires under our leadership. There, degenerates and advocates of corruption learned to kneel, or else face the wrath of the Germanic warrior should they desire to further corrupt the earth with their insufferable pleas for mercy and compassion. My growth there was slow, but calculated and meticulous. All plans and actions taken with precise estimation with a healthy dollop of cunning backing it, allowing me to climb until I was one of the city's prime members of leadership. \n\nNow, we sit at the head of a convoy, in a cramped steel truck spitting out noxious fumes, running away from the city I held so tightly in my grasp. Now, all plans of mine have fallen to ruin at the hands of the damned barbarians to the Northeast, those who think themselves so proud, so cocksure as to rise against the Aryans who have claimed this land for National Socialism, for the greatness of all of greater men who ought to dominate on this Earth. Threats of nuclear warfare after the destruction of Aurelstadt at the hands of the mongrels who deem themselves worthy of a European throne when they sit upon a throne built from degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism. We shall rise once more, past all of their bombings, no matter how many cities it takes. \n\nIt was then that the sonic boom happened, when the bright flash and cloud of smoke shot into the sky, and all of Turonen was enveloped in a wall of nuclear hellfire. All of the men turned and scowled, harrowed by the fear dealt from the atomic blast. One officer broke down in tears, clutching a secret Christian rosary he kept in his trench coat pocket while reciting a Judeo-Bolshevik Hail Mary. With the pulling of the trigger upon my Walther P38, and a crack through the air, all the men paid attention to the former officer, with a whole through his cheek and blood running out his mouth and down his cheek. The weak shall pay for their crimes which allowed for this downfall."

All of those who had fought so desperately to overthrow our justified claims over the beasts who ruled this land prior, all of them have mustered together to try to stab the great Aryan example to the world in the back, sending so much of our efforts tumbling down. Nevertheless, the Reichsführer-SS is a wise, strong leader, and under his leadership shall we deliver the Ordensstaat from this signature hell that our enemies have forged. Now, however, under the command of both the name of the Reichsführer-SS and the name of Peiper, the Ordensstaat shall reclaim a glorious shine on this world. \n\nDeep within the military complexes of the Ordensstaat, however, was where this process began. Day after day, it was not the assembly of troops, or the training of potential new recruits for high command, or the preparation and deployment of new equipment for the Waffen-Schutzstaffel which would earn us our victory. However, it was the newest Operation issued from the Reichsführer-SS. The immediate direction of nuclear production and resources towards one military operation, an action which shall find French knees quaking, Belgian and Flanderian hugging one another, begging for mercy and forgiveness, and the Catholics praying towards their false gods as they all bear witness to the might. \n\nYes, it may have been the operation of our armored and motorized divisions which helped us to win this war. Yes, the influence of our advanced firearms, exceptional artillery, masterful aerial combatants, and the overall might of the Aryan strongarm as it dealt blow after blow to our enemies, ensuring their spilt blood to be the key to the Second World War. But now, it shall be the might of the Aryan mind which wins this war, as Brigadeführer Peiper bore witness to row upon row of nuclear missile, preparing for operation to use against the decadence threatening the Ordensstaat."

 BRG_collapse.16.d:0 "From the perspective of the upper echelons of the SS-Burgund, the history and racial characteristics of the French people left a lot to be desired. After all, these were untermensch thrice beaten by the Aryan, destined to spend some small time serving their superiors material desires, and then soon doomed after the fires consumed the planet. Perhaps this was why, despite the fanaticism and loyalty that SS-Charlemagne had demonstrated during the Second Weltkrieg, they were shunted aside during the implementation of the Ordensstaat and the Burgundian way. \n\nAnd so it has led to this, as the allies of the SS-Bergund fought against it, and threatened to use the very weapons they had long cultivated as a tool for the great global transformation against them. It was this same arrogance that led the Reichsführer-SS and his closest advisors to assume that surely the French legions would not dare to use weapons of mass destruction against their German foes. After all, they were at their core cowardly and degenerate, and thus incapable of matching the will of the Aryan.\n\nBut the French SS legions had been for so long subsumed in the madness and hunger of the Ordensstaat that they had taken its ideology and made it their own. So when Himmler ordered his soldiers to continue the advance, the missles flew. The SS attack positions were obliterated, soon followed by their command infrastructure in the rear, and then the high value targets in the Burgundian interior.\n\nDid they think that there would be no retaliation? That the Burgundians would be too astonished by the nerve of their former puppets to respond quickly enough? Or that they might be lucky enough to kill the Reichsfurher-SS in their attack, and his dark state would die with him? No one can say. Perhaps they predicted a response, but chose to go into the darkness on their own terms with as many of the enemy following them as possible. \n\nEither way, the missles flew and the Shadow State, so long submerged in darkness and secrecy, burnt bright for moments before returning to embers. In time, a few survivors would crawl out into the radioactive wasteland, although few would last long."

 BRG_collapse.17.d:0 "What impact had the Wallonians made on history? What were their accomplishments, their triumphs, their meaning and purpose? Compared to the hallowed nations of great renown -- the Aryans, the Yamato people, the Americans -- very little. There were no stories of their feared strength, great constructions, or terrible victories. By the standards of the Reichsführer-SS and his minions, they were a people of small account -- just worthy of having their own small legion within the military of the Ordensstaat, to be quickly wiped out when the true designs of National Socialism were implemented. \n\nBut the arrogance of the Aryan led them to fatally underestimate their opponent. Although not nearly as numerous or well-equipped as their opponents, the SS-Langemarck matched them in the ability to unleash nuclear destruction. \n\n"Surely", thought the Riechsfurher and his close compatriots when the missive from their enemy was delivered, "such a small and worthless nation would not dare to challenge the Aryan in a truly total war". They were wrong. \n\nThe Walloonians turned out to be as good as their word, and unleashed a devastating salvo of atomic missiles upon the Burgundians, who promptly retaliated. Everywhere the camps and fortifications for which so many slave lives had been sacrificed were obliterated. The center of the Burgundian leadership, who had remained steadfast in their loyalty, proved unable to survive the fire, and vanished from the public eye."

To hoard and waste food in the middle of a declidate situation is the re-emergence of the same degenerate ideas that underpinned Jewish capitalism: using flawed judgement to place the individual's needs above those of the Volk.\n\nThe same approach must be taken. Negligent waste will result in arrest and interrogation by the Gestapo. Intentional waste or hoarding will merit a far more intensive process."
 BRG_emergency_stockpile_measures_desc:0 "Every able man is important to the Ordensstaat, yet some are more important than others. Senior officials, members of critical response groups and key state apparatus, and other such individuals instrumental to the plan of the Reichsführer-SS, must be preserved. As such, with a troubling famine looming closer upon the horizon with each passing day, we must take action to ensure that the resources are available to keep these personnel well fed. This will inevitably require the requisition of food allocations from those less deserving, who will face their reckoning in the coming struggles."
 BRG_develop_new_fertilizers_desc:0 "In the past, few things were more dangerous to a civilization than overfarming. They exploited the land to the point where it would make crops impossible to grow, and they would wither away and fade into history like the dying plants in the fields.\n\nThankfully, due to advances in the agricultural sciences, fertilizers allow farmers to restore the soil's nutrients and keep growing the same crops year after year. If the Ordensstaat is to survive and thrive, we must exploit this to the fullest extent."
 BRG_industrial_aids_desc:0 "National Socialists are not Luddites. Although they seek to preserve the physical and moral purity of the Aryan race through millennia, they recognize the value of modern industry and use it to better their environment. Agronomy is certainly no exception to this.\n\nThe traditional rural life of the future shall not be one with primitive farming implements. Plows and seed drills shall give way to tractors and combines."
 BRG_industriebauernhof_projekte_desc:0 "As industry was greatly expanded, this necessitated the centralization of the population into tight knit urban centers, so that men could work the newly built foundries and factories that dot the land. An ambitious urbanization effort was undertaken by the Ordensstaat, with many being incentivized or coerced into flocking to the cities. However, whilst a city may provide impressive outputs insofar as weaponry or industrial goods are concerned, it provides naught in terms of food, acting as a drain into which the Ordensstaat's food stores are offloaded.\n\nAs such, we are now faced with the difficult decision to roll back such initiatives, for the labourers are needed in the fields now more than ever. And they are needed with due haste. We will do what we must to drive the people back into the fields for now, even if we must demolish entire city blocks to achieve this."
 BRG_the_final_measures_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat has diligently undertaken all possible measures at its disposal to conquer the threat that the famine presents. The loyalty of essential personnel has been secured, the labor of the Volk intensified and mobilized, and previously untamed fields are now sown with grain.\n\nDespite all this, it was inevitable that those weaker and less deserving individuals in our society would perish in these hard times. It is no matter. Their mouths no longer need to be fed, and with this, our food stores shall soon begin to swell once again. With the weakest individuals sacrificed so that the Volk may be fed, and with the ingenious preparations orchestrated by the Reichsführer-SS, the famine shall soon be naught but a cold memory."
 BRG_a_second_try_desc:0 "The efforts undertaken by the Ordensstaat to stave off the great impending famine were monumental. Very few stones were left unturned in our quest to avoid troubling times. All appeared well, as our grain stores began to fill once again with fewer mouths to feed.\n\nYet it was not to last. The few stones that were left yet unturned have brought a reckoning upon the Ordensstaat, as famine has returned once more, like a painful memory come back to haunt the Aryan people. The few remaining stones from underneath which these troubles seep must be turned, regardless of cost."
 BRG_raze_the_cities_desc:0 "In order to meet the necessary quantities of grain to feed the populace in this increasingly complex crisis, radical measures must be taken. Measures which shall make all our prior efforts appear to be little more than token gestures. It begins with our centres of industry.\n\nWhilst the most industrious of our cities certainly produce well in the way of mechanical and industrial goods, it is undeniable that these regions also consume the most food, all the while producing none. If we are to solve this lingering famine in finality, we must raze these factories and pave the regions with great industrial farms, the likes of which are yet unseen in this world. We cannot dither in deciding between the grain or the cog. The cog will not feed the Aryan man nor will it nourish the laborer."
 BRG_survival_of_the_fittest_desc:0 "As the most radical of measures are undertaken, in the current short term we must face the disappointing fact that the food currently does not exist to feed all of the subjects of the Ordensstaat. As such, those who wish to be fed must prove their worth through a days' exceptional labour. Those who just get by and those who do not exert themselves to their maximum in all their labors shall simply not be fed. If prior enticements were not sufficient to encourage the workforce to produce good results, then surely the prospect of an empty stomach at the end of the day and an early grave shall act as a stronger encouragement."
 BRG_tighten_the_belts_desc:0 "Once before, when faced with famine, we had sufficient food in reserve to guarantee to the most essential and loyal soldiers of the Ordensstaat that they would be well fed and content. With the crisis growing ever more concerning, however, this may no longer be so. To ensure that all personnel have at the least something to eat, the rations of even the most loyal SchutzStaffel members must be cut. All, even the most crucial soldiers, must now do their part in self sacrifice for the cause."
 BRG_grab_it_all_desc:0 "Every day, those unworthy and unessential to the Reichsführer-SS's plans continue to fester within the Ordensstaat. Like a tapeworm, they feed upon provisions that were made to nourish the Aryan man. This will continue no longer. We will seize yet more provisions from those deemed unessential to the plans of the Reichsführer, so that those critical to the plan shall live. In the end of it all, the deaths of those being deprived do not matter."
 BRG_burgundian_diet_desc:0 "The German diet, the French diet, the Belgian diet. These are culinary traditions with hundreds of years' worth of influence, full of rich and vibrant characteristics that make them unique and treasured by chefs the world over.\n\nThey are also some of the most decadent, divisive, and un-Aryan ways of living ever known.\n\nIn this lean time, there is no room for sausages, chocolates, and fine wines. This must be a time of uniformity, a time of austerity, a time of singular devotion to the cause of the Reichsführer-SS's vision."
 BRG_nothing_shall_remain_desc:0 "As many essential individuals and German families throughout the Ordensstaat find themselves upon the brink of starvation, some seem to have scarcely taken notice. Many decadent bureaucrats and generals continue on with their needlessly excessive lifestyles, ignorant of the plight of the Ordensstaat. Lavish suppers, several course meals, desserts. For every one of their meals or functions, fifty aryan men could be healthily put to work.\n\nIt ends now.\n\nThis wastefulness will come to an immediate end. There may be backlash from the Charlemagne collaborators, but it matters not. Their pride and excessive living cannot stand, and their ire is much easier to face than the starvation of thousands of men essential to the plan."
 BRG_root_of_indulgence_desc:0 "As it turns out, there is, in fact, such a thing as wasteful food production. Indeed, not all food that is produced is conducive to our efforts at nourishing the Aryan people. With the inheritance of its territories, the Ordensstaat with it inherited the decadent established food industries so beloved by the degenerate Frenchmen. Cheesemaking. Wineries. All such lavish and excessive foodstuffs must be scuppered, for they are made irrelevant by grain and livestock. All focus must be put into those areas, and those areas alone. The Ordensstaat is not concerned with the fine dining of the fortunate few."
 BRG_some_can_stay_desc:0 "The Charlemagne collaborators, enriched in their cooperation with the Ordensstaat, are known for their lavish dining and decadent ways. Dinner parties and grand meals which could feed dozens of hard working Aryan men are instead swallowed by a fortunate few. It is revolting to think that for each time they dine, food is siphoned away from dozens of hard working Aryan men.\n\nHowever, the collaborators are regrettably essential to both the plan and the day to day operations of the Ordensstaat. We cannot risk their outright disapproval. As such, some of their particularly wasteful practices shall be disallowed, however nobody will pay a particularly watchful eye should they decide to continue with them regardless of regulation."
 BRG_needs_of_the_few_outwiegh_the_many_desc:0 "To further endear Charlemagne to the Reichsführer-SS, a proposal has been put forth: Grant the collaborators tracts of farmland to do with as they please, to feed themselves and their men, primarily. Of course, having large tracts of land from which we cannot extract the most efficient amounts of grain and livestock will reduce output greatly, and surely endanger the lives of many personnel who already rest upon the brink. Yet, despite what it shall cost in productivity and lives, the loyalty of Charlemagne is far more valuable."
 BRG_a_solved_problem_desc:0 "Finally, we may claim that no stone has been left unturned in combating the great famine. The Ordensstaat has undertaken all measures fathomable to ensure that in due time, the famine shall come to an end. As crops bloom and yields increase throughout the seasons, the troubles will come to an end in due time. That is not to say that our struggles have come to an end, for the famine will plague the Ordensstaat and its people for some time still. We simply need not worry, for now it is an issue which shall be guaranteed a resolution.\n\nFinally, we may turn our attention to the plans of the Reichsführer-SS, and do all we can with our current workforce before it continues to expire."

Kings and Queens rose, but all that remains is a horrible state of impotence for all who'd cause themselves Portuguese, and the Ordensstaat has come to understand the great level of potential in exploiting such inadequacies within the Union.

Instead, they'll turn to those who desire a more blood-soaked path to greatness for the Portuguese..."

 BRG_strike_the_bull_desc:0 "Lieutenant General Jaime Milans Del Bosch served diligently under the Captain General and Caudillo Francisco Franco's rise to power so early in the rise to victory of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis during the Second World War. However, as time progressed, he, above everyone else, saw the Judeo-Bolshevist corruption of the Spanish state, as it sought a unification with the dreaded Portuguese and even partook in the ill-fated Triumvirate in their desperate bid against the Reich, who should have been a faithful ally. Now, while he leads the most purified path in this Iberian conflict, such worries are not our priority; rather, we must ensure Bosch and his Falangists dedicate themselves to the blood of their cause more than ever before through failure met with gain, as they shall continuously know defeat and victory. This world requires an edge to be pushed towards, and currently, we need Bosch dangling without any ropes to save him!"

However, such notions will not be born out of mandate or legislation; no, only by the blood of men, women, and children shall these movements learn that they can accomplish their goals, and that no square inch of land and no piece of international support is worth keeping in the threat of their independence. We shall relay supplies to these movements, greater and more deadly weaponry will be found in these separatists' armaments, and we shall watch onwards as the Spaniard and the Portuguese is mowed down by their former subjects! We must remember, our secured army in Asturian territory is more than ready to handle things on their own, for now..."

However, now more than ever before, their legitimacy has crashed through the floorboards, as various, more extreme, more radical, and more ruthless factions find themselves claiming to be the legitimate successor state in the mighty conflict which rocks Iberia. Empowering these states, as powered as the Jew and the Bolshevik as they may sometimes be, is necessary in order to guarantee more bodies pile up across Iberia, and the world gets drawn more and more into the great bloodshed of Iberia."

A backwater tribe of Judeo-Bolshevik, genetically-inferior neanderthals, hellbent on establishing a new age of freedom as they work together in some fairy-taleish bid for power in a world consumed by the inferno surrounding them. However, they are ours to completely control as a puppet state completely tied to our grasp, and it is in this control that we will use these tribesmen to wreak havoc all across the Iberian Peninsula. Yes, it is true that many within the Ordensstaat may find the support of Communists in the world of today abhorrent, and may find the exercise to be too great a betrayal of our ideas to go through it, but such men do not possess the strength nor the will to see our operations completed, and will be dealt with as such.

This is where we shall benefit, however: the Asturians are one such bunch, who believe that through natural work together, then they shall harvest the Earth and its glories. Their faults will be our aid, however, as they shall work the land to death by command of our leadership, whilst every single cent is handed towards the Ordensstaat's wealth, rather than bolstering their own ranks. Yes, this may help spell death for this project of ours; however, why pump the heart of a dying, Communist battalion when we can fund so, so much more?"

Every day, another Spanish father, another Portuguese mother, and another child of a minority find themselves plunged straight into the battle which consumes their lands, as the ashes of their homes, business places, and sources of entertainment all wipe across their face, as does the blood of their comrades. Iberia is broken, Spain is destroyed, Portugal is dead, and we have benefitted each and every step of the way, both in operations and in investments. The world has sunk its entire attention towards the blood which floods the lands of the peninsula, while the coffers of the Ordensstaat stand bloated from all of the sales and investments coming forth from the entirety of our actions across that accursed Peninsula. The time has come for the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund to take its hand off of 세계계획 콘도르, and allow our splendors to rain forth from the Hell that is now Iberia."

Their dreams of glory will be fulfilled, or we will manufacture the dream. To do this, we have devised a variety of methods- including highlighting the voices of extremism and militarism as for intervention to seem like the most moderate option, or ensuring reports on violence at the border to always reach Ankara without fail.

 BRG_der_ruin_des_architekten_desc:0 "Albert Speer is a strange and tragicomic creature. While on one hand he is supremely unsuited for the role of Führer, being soft-hearted and tending towards tolerating politically and racially questionable characters, he also differs from his opponents through genuine competence and recognition of the Reich's many failings. That is however also why he must be weakened and pushed towards a more hardline policy. We cannot risk having him trying to turn back the clock to 1932, or worse, seek detente with the Japanese and Americans. As such, as much as it pains us, we must rally the supporters of statism and degeneracy against his rule; for the good of the race the Volk must be allowed to slide further."
 BRG_stable_no_more_text:0 "Stable No Longer"
 BRG_stable_no_more_desc:0 "Due to Speer's weakness of character and courage, he has not dared properly purging the supporters of his opponents. While most of the handful of SS supporters have fled to us or into the vast Reichskommissariats, many of the bureaucrat fatcats of Bormann and armchair generals of Göring still waddle around the hallowed halls of Germania. We must extend a helping, and as anonymous as possible, hand to these poor lost souls and help push them to act against the new government."
 BRG_deform_his_image_text:0 "Deform the Führer's Image"
 BRG_deform_his_image_desc:0 "That insolent worm Speer has blamed the... cleansings of the war years on us in the SS. While this is not... wholly untrue, it is still a grave disrespect to the important work of the SS-Totenkopfverbande and other loyal servants of the Race. While we don't mind him blaming that useless sot Heydrich, it was his damn conference that started it all in the first place, he also names the Reichsführer, Adolf Eichmann, and many other prominent Burgundians as partakers in these actions. Our propagandists have prepared a wave of underground "newspapers" with articles instead blaming most of the mass death on Albert Speer's slavery system and brutal usage of the slaves. Let us see how he likes being slandered."
 BRG_polarize_the_climate_text:0 "Let the Sparks Fly"
 BRG_polarize_the_climate_desc:0 "Our initial propaganda campaign was highly successful, it is time to graduate our misinformation from just underground newspapers to anti-government posters and pamphlets. Let us see if Speer's limpwristed "government" has the strength to tear them down."
 BRG_support_the_wehwirtchaftsfuhrer_text:0 "Connection on the Inside"
 BRG_support_the_wehwirtchaftsfuhrer_desc:0 "We have identified an industrialist by the name of Friedrich Flick, once one of the Wehrwirtschaftsführers who considered themselves "friends of the Reichsführer" before our move to the Ordensstaat, and who was sympathetic to Heydrich during the Civil War. Speer have either foolishly failed to vet him or cowardly failed to purge him, because Flick retains his fortune, his conglomerate, and his immense influence in the economy.

 BRG_whatever_it_takes_text:0 "Whatever It Takes..."
 BRG_whatever_it_takes_desc:0 "There are certain benefits to Speer ascending to the Reichskanzellei; his reforms are extremely unpopular with almost all levels of bourgeoisie society and especially in the ranks of the Party. While it may be painful for us to directly harm the Reich, destabilizing his regime and loosing his grip on power will be extremely beneficial to our end goal of preventing his efforts for reconciliation. Vorwarts!"

 BRG_the_revolt_desc:0 "The slaves in the Reich have revolted! While it is certain that in due time, even the degenerated Wehrmacht of Speer's Reich will put down the unwashed hordes rising against their masters, in the meantime the terrible publicity for the Führer and the panic among the propertied classes will ensure that confidence in the government hits rock bottom. We need to reach out to our friends in the German media and make sure as much of the propaganda as possible have critical attitudes to the government's handling, but not the Party or the Heer."
 BRG_load_schroners_die_text:0 "Load Schörner's Die"
 BRG_load_schroners_die_desc:0 "General Schörner is the most senior member of Göring's militarist faction still active in the political circles of the Reich. He is rightfully advocating taking a hardline stance against the revolting untermensch, and is highly critical of the government line. If we can leverage our grip in the media once more, we can ensure he is portrayed as a hero of the crackdown on the slaves and champion of Aryan supremacy, insulating him from any removal attempts and making him an unchallenged voice for a militaristic line."

This was a natural development of the competitive nature of the Party bigshots in the thirties, forties and fifties; everyone wanted a pet agency for collecting blackmail and secrets. We must ensure our spies and sympathizers are thoroughly infiltrated in as many of these services as possible, so that we can access this information, particularly about the many Party members we seek to control and direct towards supporting the government and our chosen businesses."

 BRG_reap_what_we_sow_desc:0 "It is time to begin properly extracting wealth from Bormann's empire before his hold on the Reich withers from inaction. Flick's conglomerate and other loyal businesses will funnel money, equipment, materials and much else out of the Reich and into the Ordensstaat where it will shore up our own state. While their blackmail efforts are now less necessary, our spies in the German intelligence services will continue providing us with whatever info they can find on the internal situation of the Reich."

 BRG_the_militarist_desc:0 "That bloated establishment toady Göring and his military supporters have secured their grip over Germania. While normally we would be loathe to endorse such a useless waste of uniform material, the fool tied his cause heavily to the militarist faction of the Party and their allies in the Wehrmacht. Our primary goal should thus be to champion the militarist cause to drive conflict, while simultaneously undermining the False Führer's authority by denying him easy victories and economic stability. Plans must be drawn up at once."

 BRG_equipment_to_their_enemies_desc:0 "The bloated carcass in the Reichskanzellei has finally been goaded into initiating offensive operations against whatever unfortunate countries the militarists want to loot that day. Sadly, with the Aryan might of the Wehrmacht marching against them, few European countries could stand against them for long. If we are to slow down Görings successes and exaggerate his failures, we must ensure his potential enemies get a solid donation of firearms and military equipment from the "French State." It will be technically correct since we are a state controlling part of France."
 BRG_failure_for_their_friends_text:0 "Failure for their Friends"
 BRG_failure_for_their_friends_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, so with some strategic raids by "partisans" on the Heer's supply lines we can ensure the soldiers stay hungry, disgruntled, short on ammunition and are left generally in poor combat condition. Even if they still win, the road there will be long and tortuous, the blame pointing squarely at Germania."
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_text:0 "Find the Weak Links"
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_desc:0 "On the surface Göring's support base seems solid, but in reality many of his supporters view him with skepticism, for example the militarist leader, General Schörner. We must map out these voices and ensure their influence is strengthened both in the Party and Army, to push the Reich towards more aggressive policies."
 BRG_cut_the_strings_text:0 "Slash the Chains"
 BRG_cut_the_strings_desc:0 "With Göring's critics located and strengthened, we can begin taking active measures to split and weaken his support base. Before long, the Hero of the Luftwaffe will be the hero of very few with real power and influence."
 BRG_goodbye_goering_text:0 "Goodbye Göring"
 BRG_goodbye_goering_desc:0 "The False Führer's influence is diminishing by the day, he is now little more than a puppet of the militarists, left playing his incompetent games with the economy like a toddler locked in his room.

 BRG_another_road_block_text:0 "Another Roadblock"
 BRG_another_road_block_desc:0 "To improve the raiding of our "partisans", they will now be equipped with detailed maps of the logistics storehouses, machineguns to help suppress a potential counterattack by the guards, and plastic explosives to destroy anything that cannot be stolen. Things will not be easy for the Reich's soldiers."
 BRG_prepare_for_our_turn_text:0 "The Final Plan"
 BRG_prepare_for_our_turn_desc:0 "Somehow, Göring has managed to achieve his goals so far, albeit at a great cost to the Reich. To our joy, our spies in the Oberkommando now report that the delusional militarists are planning grand conquests for world domination that our foreign policy analysts pretty much guarantee will lead to a new world war. All we really need to do is make sure they are encouraged to continue."
 BRG_der_entruckung_text:0 "Der Entrückung"
 BRG_der_entruckung_desc:0 "It appears the latest target for Göring's wild ride of military conquest is... the Ordensstaat. This is unfortunate, but not unexpected. The Oberkommando in Germania is fearful about our nuclear arsenal, which we can use to our advantage. If we can rush the SS into German territory, local silo commanders or even the Oberkommando themselves might panic and order the deployment of part of their nuclear arsenal. With how tense the Americans and Japanese are over German resurgence, that should be more than enough to trigger a global conflict. We must ready ourselves for Rapture, Ragnarök is upon us!"

 BRG_globalplan_adler_decisions_desc:0 "The Reich, what once was the glimmering hallmark of Aryan Masterdom against a world of putridity, in which the Vaterland would stand triumphant against the Judeo-Bolshevists who would dare call themselves equal to our mighty grasp, has since fallen into a despairful pit of decadence, sin, and treason. So great is the extreme putridity characterizing the Reich that it fell into its own horrific Civil War, pitting the Germanic Master Race against itself in a horrific gladiatorial arena throughout the Reich. Now, however, only one false Führer stands to call themselves leader of the Aryan people, gutting the strength of the Germanic people even more as they feed the bloated corpse of the Reich more lies every passing day in order to maintain the survival of their unholy power. However, while this sickly beast continues to crawl through the mud of this world to try to find power, the Ordensstaat poised to strike, ready to do all we can to bring down this fallen behemoth who once dared called themselves the masters of this solemn world. And with how deranged the country has become, it shall not be long until they aid greatly towards the Reichsführer-SS's plan..."

 ###Events

 BRG_adler.1.t:0 "Shadows on the Rail"
 BRG_adler.1.d:0 ""Agents Ten, Twelve, Thirteen, Thirty-Three, make way upon the railing above." Echoed the earpieces of the Aryan servants of the Ordensstaat's shadow. Thus, the men descended from the roof onto the dark balconies above, hidden away under the shadow of the night as their rifles came ready to use upon the floor below. \n\nThe factory doors came to a crash as the men entered the room, ready to meet just whoever so happened to have contacted the legendary Businessman of the Reich at this time of the night. "Uh, hello, anyone there?" said the Businessman, in the most regal attire of a trenchcoat as his guards smoked cigars. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." echoed a voice from the darkness, as a man took a few paces to greet the entourage upon their entrance into the area. "Supposing, at this time of the night, you'd enjoy the skipping of pleasantries so that business may be conducted?" the man said, adorned in mystery. Flick shook his head slowly in response. "Well, then allow me to begin. You see, there are elements of this world which lurk under the watchful eyes of Dictators, Generals, the Reich, and even the Führer himself, Herr Flick. Elements of this world which would like to see themselves involved in the meandering of Speerian governing, and are willing to pay handsomely for it." The man said, opening a briefcase full of Reichsmarks. \n\nWith the dark room laid to silence, Herr Flick continued to ponder the question for just a few minutes, until finally, his eyes brightened up. With a shaking of hands, the Reichsmark were taken that day, and the Ordensstaat had a way straight to Speer's heart. \n\n"Alright, gentlemen, lay down your rifles." the Man said, as the clambering of military gear being set down began."
 BRG_adler.1.a:0 "Terror to some, greatness for us."

 BRG_adler.3.t:0 "The Facade of a Million Shadows"
 BRG_adler.3.d:0 "The Office of the Führer deep within the Halls of Germania was once embellished with the great calls for glory from the illustrious Adolf Hitler, the marching, arm-locked-in-arm, of Generals discussing the glory of the Reich's conquests, and the countless citizens of Germania enjoying, for themselves, the Empire which gave them dominion over the world. Now, however, the Führer himself lies in silence, begging himself not to take another cigarette in fear of his health, hand clasped in hand, as he stares into the distance, telephone in hand. \n\n"My Führer, the ongoing protests within several of the Reich's universities are not, I repeat, not at the hands of remaining Civil War elements. A series of documents have been circulating to the public, sir. A series of documents about you, my Führer." the voice said gravely over the telephone. \n\n"What do they say, Gruppenführer?" Speer said, being met with a few moments of silence. "Gruppenführer, what the hell did they say?" the Führer said, in a mix of terror and great, seething anger. \n\n"Sir, they. They discuss information regarding your participation in the extended extermination of non-Aryans over the course of the Second World War and the years following." The military leader said, sending the painful shiver of horror straight into the void that made up the Führer's soul. "Students are responding in organization over the issue, asking you directly for answers, my Führer." \n\nThe realization of the painful setback of progress for the Reich shook Speer. No longer could he work towards securing his position of leadership in the Reich riding upon the pure faith of the reformists without answering towards the untold truths which lie at his feet. What has begun must be dealt with as always, however."
 BRG_adler.3.a:0 "I will handle it personally, Gruppenführer."

 BRG_adler.4.t:0 "A Devoted Soul"
 BRG_adler.4.d:0 ""So, Herr Flick, you have provided that, under the direct submittance of an additional seven and a half million Reichsmarks, that you shall be within immediate compliance towards general coordinated statements forwarded by our office, am I correct?" the icy, rasped voice of the Reichsführer-SS echoed out over the telephone towards the Businessman of the Reich. \n\n"National Socialism brought greatness to the Reich, it made the Reich whole. I am more than willing to do what I can as a true patriot to the German country and her people and stave off Speer's corruption; however, I simply have a few questions. Firstly, what will I be doing in accordance with our agreement, what do I have to do to ensure we do right by the Reich?" Flick said, meeting silence on the other end of the line. "And what about anonymity? My name is going to be scratched off of any documents regarding our deals and whatnot, correct?" Flick asked again. Meanwhile, the phone line continue to meet his expectations with a droning monotone. \n\n"You will find out soon, Herr Flick, but do not worry: no one shall know of our deals, and the millions you have earned from them." the Reichsführer-SS stated, as the phone line hung up. Six hundred miles apart from one another, both men took steps back from their chair, and readied themselves for the coming future."
 BRG_adler.4.a:0 "His patriotism shall be our gain."

 BRG_adler.5.t:0 "Bloody Ferdinand's Escape"
 BRG_adler.5.d:0 ""That's fucking bullshit, Kessler, there's no way in Hell that He could have gotten out of that compound that quickly, we had our men on every door into the goddamn place!" Wedekind said, crashing his cigar to the ashtray in anger. "The Führer is asking for our goddamn department to handle this, and we can't even find this shithead!" he said, filling the office with anger. \n\n"When did the unites at the East entrance last report?" Kessler said, as he continued to stare straight at the map below him on the table. \n\n"What the fuck are you talking about, Kessler? Twenty-Six hours ago, right after they went on patrol when they lost this monster, remember the damn report?" Wedekind said. \n\n"That's what I mean. Get a report from them, now. Find where they are, who they're with, their names, everything." Kessler said, as Wedekind confusingly went off to fulfill the task at hand. An hour later, the creaky door opened back into the investigation room as Wedekind made his way back into the room, report in hand and sunken eyes to match. "What's it say?" Kessler said. \n\n"Killed. Slaves got them, every last one of them, beat them to death with a few stab wounds in each." Wedekind responded. \n\nThe two men sat in a cold, silent anguish over the thoughts of what happened. That was before Kessler shot out his chair and grabbed Wedekind. "Wedekind, you listen here and you listen close. Look at that map and tell me, where in the Hell did slaves come out of nowhere when their nearest compound is dozens of miles away?" Kessler said, filling Wedekind with a great fear of the unknown."
 BRG_adler.5.a:0 "I-I don't know."

 BRG_adler.8.t:0 "The Pilot's Flight"
 BRG_adler.8.d:0 "The Reichsführer-SS sat patiently, quietly, and coldly, dancing his fingers upon the table as he waited for the incoming report his presence had been requested for. And, as  if on cue by the grand director of this wretched life, Ernst Kaltenbrunner came in, manilla folder in hand. "Glory to the Reichsführer-SS." stated the Nazi towering over the desk, offering his greatest Nazi salute. "Sir, these cold mornings have allowed for us a great victory in the fall of the succumbing Reich." he said, handing his superior the folder. \n\nAs the papers flipped by, the Reichsführer-SS continued to understand the meaning of these messages. That Fat Pig claiming to be the Führer as he waddled around, medallions in hand, is marching onward towards a new Grand War Strategy, dubbed "War Plan B," dedicated towards the annexation of further territories in the ravaging quest for new splendors for the Reich in their new failure. The Turkish, the Iberians, the Italians, the Russians, the Syrians, and the Africans would all come to meet a wall of the Reich's soldiers if all would go according to the plans of the decadent Hermann Göring. \n\n"Return to your duties, Herr Kaltenbrunner." the Reichsführer-SS said, as his underling marched off. Finally, it was time for the Ordensstaat to begin the immediate production of arms and equipment for these nations, and finally get involved with a little "foreign aid" in order to play catch up with the Reich's forward motion, and ensure their collapse comes yet."
 BRG_adler.8.a:0 "Göring will fail yet."

 BRG_adler.11.t:0 "Conquest on the Horizon"
 BRG_adler.11.d:0 "Ernst Kaltenbrunner once again found his way into the Reichsführer-SS's office as he twisted and turned down the halls of the High Command of the Ordensstaat. "Heil Reichsführer-SS." he said with a strong salute, yet exasperated and fearful breath. "Our agents have discovered immediately pertinent intelligence regarding the Führer's plan with the Ordensstaat, sir." He said, shifting the thick manilla folder towards the Reichsführer-SS's face. \n\n"I shall handle this personally, Herr Kaltenbrunner. You are dismissed, for now." the Reichsführer-SS said, as Kaltenbrunner shut the iron door behind him. Opening the document in front of him, the Reichsführer-SS's eyes' meeting of the words "Fall Schwarz" brought a great discovery to his mind... \n\nThe greatest key to the Plan he has ever found. \n\nThus, the Reichsführer-SS prepared. Yes, it was true that this a great discovery for the benefit of the future; however, how could he hope to achieve success if the plans were not in place? Allowing the Reich to run over and invade the Ordensstaat was an obvious impossibility if he sought to enact the Plan. Thus, he would have to prepare the great and mighty Aryans of the Ordensstaat to pledge every single man, every single resource, and every single bullet, towards waging a great war with the Rech. This would be their fate. This was destiny."
 BRG_adler.11.a:0 "Ragnarök awaits."

 BRG_adler.13.t:0 "Keep your Enemies Closer"
 BRG_adler.13.d:0 ""And that's how you managed to keep those Russian regiments on the run at Suslov? Tell me, tell me, what happened after the battle, Gruppenführer?" the amicable Walther Hewel stated, laughing as he ate. \n\n"Well, that's where I earned this." the SS-Gruppenführer stated as he pointed in the large scar across his left cheek. "The Russians had just enough explosives planted in their retreat to make it work, and took out a swathe of my man, and left me blind in my left eye for quite some time. But the Aryan does not give in, Mr. Hewel, he does not give up." The SS-Gruppenführer stated, causing the Foreign Minister of the Bormann administration to roar with laughter and giddiness towards the tale of war and bloodshed. "You are one mighty creature, Gruppenführer, a Lion in the company of Mice! Please, here is my personal office's telephone number, do be sure to call and we can talk anytime, they give me whatever I want up there, and you can get well paid in turn!" said Hewel, as he got up from the leather chair and walked away to grab more food, as the SS-Gruppenführer called \n\n"Sir, I would request one favor of you." he said to the listening Walther Hewel. "Stay evermore devoted to the glorious Führer Bormann, a true patriot." Hewel offered a smile and nod as he walked off. The SS-Gruppenführer, however, could not understand the nature of the operation. Why would the Reichsführer-SS desire to support the foundations of these idiots? Hewel could hardly keep himself contained and became a walking embarrassment over a small story of War in the West, how could we support these degenerates? The Reichsführer-SS must have a plan, and faith will be required if he sought the will to maintain this position and earn the Ordensstaat an inside to this entire spider web in the Reich."
 BRG_adler.13.a:0 "Degenerates, all of them."

 BRG_adler.14.t:0 "Strange Waters"
 BRG_adler.14.d:0 "The Führer, Martin Bormann, worked diligently upon his desk in his office in Germania. Everyday, incoming military, political, and economic reports gave new and rising situations regarding the Reich and her troubles, whilst the Führer himself offered estimations and calculations about how to conceptualize fixes for all these messes. One such mess required not fixing, yet still occupied Bormann's mind for quite some time: what was going on to cause the recent outspoken support from so much of the Administration, especially in a perilous time like this? \n\n"My Führer! Just the man I wanted to see!" said the Foreign Minister, Walther Hewel, as he crashed through the office. "I just had the most wonderful conversation at the Party Rally yesterday, sir, and I was reminded of just what I needed to do!" the Minister said, loudly for this time in the morning. \n\n"Ah, really? And what is it that you must do at a time like this, Hewel?" Bormann asked with a degree of annoyance and scorn as he lit a cigarette. \n\n"Well, sir, that's just it: it's you! The mighty Führer, Martin Bormann, who saved the Reich from collapse and preserved the legacy of the mighty Adolf Hitler! You have made our lives and prosperity possible, and no one seems to be cheery enough to say that anymore, sir! Thank you, and, remember, my office is always free to offer you what I can provide!" Hewel said, as he pat Bormann on the back and left. \n\nAnd there it was again. Another leader in the administration, overjoyed at everything Bormann was doing. This couldn't be right: the Reich was still facing issues, and as much as Hewel may be a fool, he wasn't just so easily able to overlook that. What was going on with the administration to flood these compliments? Then again, perhaps, the Führer thought to himself, maybe it was just time to offer himself some more credit for once."
 BRG_adler.14.a:0 "To worry or not?"

 BRG_adler.15.t:0 "A Phantom of Sorrows and Wealth"
 BRG_adler.15.d:0 "The brick and mortar walls of this ancient fortress filled the Businessman with fears of the children's stories of phantoms of Germany's past. However, he knew a great deal more about the terror able to be enacted by the phantoms he was surrounded with, whether it be the soul-draining nature of Speer's corruption, or the paralyzing fear of the men he worked with now. Thus came the terror as the Businessman turned and saw the the Scarred Giant of the Schutzstaffel enter the office. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." spoke the menacing voice that flowed through the Giant. \n\n"Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner, it is an honor." stated Flick, with a slight hint of mistruth as his terror ensured the tension of the meeting. \n\n"Sit down, Herr Flick. We have much to discuss." said Kaltenbrunner, as he came around to sit beside the Businessman. "Herr Flick, it has come under the understanding of your devotion to the cause of National Socialism, and your willingness to support the cause through the tragedies of the modern day which harm it so greatly. Thus, in accordance with your transactionary deals, your immediate orders are to cede as great a percentile of operations for your industries towards Führer Bormann's regime immediately." Kaltenbrunner said. \n\n"This is an outrage, those are my profits, my hard earned business success! How could we support that fool in times like these, this is treachery, this is an insult!" shouted Flick. \n\n"Herr Flick, you will understand the orders you have been provided and see they come into fruition or else face the bylaws of our contract." stated Kaltenbrunner as the two SS guards in the back took a step forward. As Flick sat back down, he could not help but cede his own will to the Scarred Giant across from him."
 BRG_adler.15.a:0 "It must be done."

 BRG_adler.16.t:0 "Reports, Redactions, and Removals"
 BRG_adler.16.d:0 "The pleasing mild successes accomplished by the Führer and his administration, managing to keep a smile plastered onto the people's faces had been assailed by a new confusing issue. The Führer continued to look onward, enjoying his organization and structure as a Master of the Bureaucrats, and, yet, something was wrong. Very wrong. As Bormann searched and scurried through his office, running his hand over every drawer and cubby, something was gone. \n\nMissing. \n\nSeveral things were. Yet, also, things that weren't here at the last point the Führer had come into his office had made their way onto his shelves and cases, when his secretary hadn't requested file transfers or anything of the sort! The matter brought sweat to the already-hardworked Führer's forehead, as the panic and confusion and paranoia of dissent and trickery plagued his mind. No, this couldn't have been, this was a simple trick, a mistake in the wake of the Führer's great work across the Reich taking up so much of his own time. However, in that slight chance, what if it truly is someone else instead? The Führer knew not, as he set his pen down and grasped his face, trying to ease his tensions."
 BRG_adler.16.a:0 "Get a hold of yourself."

Although its subversion is not as crucial to our plans as a few others, Italy holds much exploitable economic opportunities we can use for funding, stagnant cocoons of liquid gold awaiting our knives to plunge into. These manifest in holes in the integrity of the corporatist hierarchy, corrupt fascists willing to tear themselves open for counterfeit lire. The colonial order will be sustained until we have drained every last drop. Rome will suckle on our breasts, not knowing that our wolves are laced with poison. Here's to the tragedy to ensure."

Toppling the fragile colonial orders of both down until a region-spanning war occurs would allow our plans in the Middle East to come into fruition. To do this, we will fund paramilitaries and terrorists to wreak havoc for our machinations. Palestinian liberation parties will inspire intercommunal violence, Jewish ultranationalists will massacre villages, and the incompotent adminstrators will utterly fail to resolve the crumbling wall that seperates the northern and southern corridors of Lebanon.

Their dreams of glory will be fulfilled, or we will manufacture the dream. To do this, we have devised a variety of methods- including highlighting the voices of extremism and militarism as for intervention to seem like the most moderate option, or ensuring reports on violence at the border to always reach Ankara without fail. Lines will be drawn by us for their economic woes and struggles to originate from Lebanon, and they will blindly accept the correlation.

 BRG_The_Tsar_desc:0 "서러시아는 기사단국에게 톡특한 퍼즐을 제공하고 있습니다. 우리의 목표는 두가지인데 서로 상쇄될 수 있는 것 같습니다. 우리는 러시아의 심장부의 혼돈을 모아 라이히에게 혼란을 불러일으킬수 있는 역할을 할 강력한 지역 강군을 만들어야 합니다. 이 꼭두각시는 다른 신생 러시아 국가들을 하나로 묶을 수 있을 만큼 충분히 강해야 하며, 또한 수 세대에 걸쳐 라이히의 노선을 슬라브 군단에게 저항하는데 힘을 쏟게 하여 약화시키고 결정적으로 경멸스러운 모스코비엔 국가판무관부를 박살내 종식시킬 수 있어야 합니다. 둘째로 이 신흥 강대국은 부르군트 SS 기사단국에 대한 어떠한 정보나 저항을 가지고 있지 않아야 하며 슈츠슈타펠에게 위협이 될 만한 이념적 성향을 가지고 있지 않아야 합니다.\n\n운 좋게도 두가지 기준을 모두 총족하는 후보자를 발견했습니다. 자칭 차르인 퇴위 러시아 왕정의 후손인 뱟카 군벌이 우리의 공작에 유망한 후보로 선정되었습니다. 차르는 이전에 총통에게 부역하며 자신을 볼셰비즘에 대항할수 있는 아이콘으로 사용해달라 부탁한 적이 있습니다. 이것은 이전 볼셰비키의 독일 재침공 때 러시아인들에게 확실한 효과를 나타냈습니다. 뱟카는 요즘 조금씩 성장하며 도시를 발전시키기 시작했는데 이것은 우리 요원들을 심을 수 있는 절호의 기회입니다. 첫번째 단계는 우선 단순한 영향력 수집이 될 것이지만 그들 내부에 우리 쪽 사람들을 두는 것 자체가 향후 개입에 큰 도움이 될 겁니다."
 BRG_The_Brotherhood_desc:0 "서러시아의 혼란 속에서 일어난 세력은 지구를 오염시키고 있는 아리아 민족의 모든 이념적 원수의 축소판이라고 할 수 있습니다. 지금까지 쓰여졌던 모든 신조와 마셨던 모든 독들은 가장 극단적인 형태의 자유주의적 퇴폐의 변칙에서부터 엄격한 종교적 독단주의의 영혼을 부식시키는 변칙에 이르기까지 곰의 시체 안쪽에 새겨져 있는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 공산주의자들만 조국의 적이 아닙니다. 우리가 세상을 선하고 더 올바르게 만들려면 현상태의 관료들 역시 몰살시켜야 합니다. 가장 충격적인 것은 운터멘쉬들이 감히 자신들을 국가사회주의자라고 칭하고 있다는 겁니다...\n\n 아르한겔스크와 뱟카에 이르는 여러 두드러진 강국들과는 달리 이 러시아 약소국은 우리의 목표에 크게 가치가 없습니다. 아마 전쟁이 벌어진다면 이들은 그냥 주변 강국들이 쌓게 될 시체의 산 그 이상 의미를 가지진 못할 겁니다. 그들은 가장 굴욕적인 죽음을 맞이할 자격이 있습니다. 자신의 부하들에게 죽음을 당하는 것만큼 굴욕적인 죽음이 있을까요? 이 "아리아인 형제단"은 우리 요원들이 선동한 조직적인 집단 노예 반란에 휩싸여 감히 아리아인을 참칭한 것에 대한 대가를 받게 될 겁니다. 우리 SS요원들은 밤이 되면 형제단의 도시로 잠입해 파괴하고, 도망가기보다는 싸우기를 선호하는 자들을 무장시킬 겁니다. 다시는 러시아인들이 감히 '아리아인'을 칭하지 못하게 해야지요."
 BRG_The_Samaran_Question_desc:0 "블라소프는 과거 붉은 군대의 파르티잔으로서 공산주의를 위해 러시아 제국을 전복시키는 것으로 그의 커리어를 시작했습니다. 모스크바에서 국방군에게 패한 후 그는 반역자가 되어 라이히와 연합해 총통을 위해 싸우기로 결심한 러시아인들을 이끌었습니다. 처음부터 그의 조국에 대한 충성심은 의심스러웠습니다. 그는 러시아 동부의 볼셰비키들이 무너질때까지 묵묵히 그의 임무를 수행했고 그 이후 독일 장비로 무장한 러시아 군인들을 이끌어 하나의 군벌로 변모시켰습니다. 그는 다른 사람들과 같은 운명을 맞이할 자격이 있습니다.\n\n우리 정보에 의하면 블라소프 군의 반체제 인사인 오흐탄은 쿠데타를 일으킬 준비를 하고 있는것 같습니다. 사마라 내전이 벌어진다면 우리는 그를 아낌없이 도울 것입니다. 사마라의 사람들은 그의 세력이 의아할 정도로 갑자기 커지며 블라소프의 충성파 병력들이 사라지는 것을 알게 될 겁니다. 우리가 파악한 바 오흐탄은 우리의 선물을 의도에 대한 의심없이 받아들일 바보로 판단됩니다. 곧 블라소프 장군에게 배반으로 세력을 키운 모든 자들의 운명을 보여주도록 합시다."
 BRG_The_Freikorp_desc:0 "폭격으로 파괴된 도시가 가득하고 자그만한 주들로 붕괴된 서러시아의 황폐한 초원과 불타버린 숲은 아리아 민족의 불굴의 의지에 반하는 모든 것의 정당한 운명으로서 우뚝 서 있습니다. 선조들이 이전에 슬라브인들에게 야기시킨 재앙 때문에 발생한 혼란사태로 이제 우리 기사단국이 막대한 행운을 거머쥐게 되었습니다. 없는 거나 다름없는 현지 기반시설과 부패한 관료들의 비도덕이 초래한 질서의 부재는 새로운 보병 여단이나 무기를 그 출처에 대한 의심없이 우리가 원하는 곳으로 옮길 수 있게 만들어 주었습니다. 따라서 뱟카의 지방 당국은 그들의 '사랑하는' 차르에게 충성하고 군 복무 준비가 되어 있는 전문적으로 무장하고 훈련된 군인들을 발견하게 되어 매우 기뻐할 겁니다. 물론 우리의 독일 억양에 대해 좀 조치를 취해야 하겠지만 말이죠."
 BRG_Infiltrate_The_Okhrana_desc:0 "만약 뱟카의 차르에게 복무하고 있는 군인들 중 그나마 정예라고 불리는 자들이 있다면 그건 아마 오흐라나일 겁니다. 이 호위병들은 차르의 영토에 대한 내부 질서를 유지하는 책임을 맡고 있는데 이것은 우리의 입장에서 우리의 국가가 뱟카의 정치와 군사같은 모든 면에 영향을 미칠수 있는 최고의 방법임을 의미합니다. 지금 뱟카에 존재하는 우리의 요원들은 뱟카의 모든 군인중에 가장 뛰어나기 때문에 그들이 오흐라나에 임명되는 것이 그리 어렵지 않을 것입니다. 하지만 차르의 경호원들이 그들의 새 친구를 너무 의심한다면 우리 셔츠 주머니에 넣어준 중요한 물건 몇 개가 그걸 보증하기에 충분하고도 남을 것입니다. 고대 로마의 프라이토리아니들이 로마의 정치에 큰 영향을 미쳤듯이 우리의 통제 하에 있는 오흐라나 또한 러시아 차르주의자들의 정치에 중대한 영향을 미칠 수 있게 될 것입니다."
 BRG_Wo_alle_strasen_enden_desc:0 "뱟카의 차르에 대한 모든 준비가 끝났습니다. 우리는 그가 그의 국가를 확장하고 러시아 전쟁을 준비하는 동안 우리가 할 수 있는 모든 것을 다했습니다. 차르는 모르고 있지만 그는 우리의 도움 없이는 그렇게 유능한 채로 존재할 수 없었을 겁니다. 심지어 그의 안전을 책임지는 가장 가까운 사람들조차 우리 손 안에 있습니다. 우리의 모든 작품들은 뱟카가 서러시아의 운터멘쉬들을 없애기 위해, 그리고 우리 조국 옆에 존재하는 슈츠슈타펠의 적들을 무찌를수 있게 할 장기말일 뿐입니다. 차르는 우리의 의도에 따라 꼭두각시처럼 제국을 운영할 것이며 SS국가지도자 각하의 적들은 그들이 받아들여할 운명을 맞이할 것입니다. 이 러시아를 다시 제국으로 만드는데 수십만의 슬라브인들이 죽어야 한다면 그것도 좋은 일입니다. 어차피 세상은 그들이 많아지는것을 바라지 않으니까요."

By funneling supplies to the radical groups on the left and right alike, infiltrating all sectors of American society, and building a network of connections able to further the will of the Reichsfurher, we will at last bring the American "giant" to its knees. By the order of the Reichsfurher-SS, the exploitation and sabotage of the New World's vast array of resources is of highest priority. Success in this area will allow the Plan to advance to completion, ushering the final triumph of the Aryan, and a glorious new age worthy of his true capabilities."

He seeks to pressure other nations into nuclear disarmament through gunboat diplomacy and the sheer strength of the American atomic stockpile. However, that relies on two things: the ability to construct plenty of atomic bombs, and other nations lacking that capability. A few well-placed saboteurs in the American Department of Defense, plus some discreet advisors to other nations, would do well to keeping the Reichsführer-SS's vision unimpeded."

Regardless, We cannot allow this to go ahead, it would throw a wrench in the Reichsführer-SS' plans and set back Our progress with several years. While We try to think out ways to stop the unhinged spacefarer controlling the USA, maybe it is time We did the suffering peoples of the Americas a service, nay, a gift! Recently, Our agents... acquired some American plant schematics that our scientists say suggest confirms our theory of utilizing positive void coefficients to boost nuclear reactivity even at low power levels. This knowledge could help us make cheaper and more efficient reactors.

The Reichsführer may have been unable to save the Führer at the time, but he still learned much from his examples. You must appeal to the people directly to bypass the alluring madness of the Red Hydra. The Glenn administration is speaking of reducing their nuclear arsenal, to save money for his Bukharinite social programs. Surely the people won't accept this insanity from the R-D's, even if they are degenerates. We must immediately redeploy our agents to manage propaganda campaigns denouncing this open invitation to Japanese invasion. A few riots may make Glenn redecide the worth of destroying his country in service of Marx.

The man nodded, popped out his own lighter, and lit Edwards smoke.\n\n"That was... something." The man began. "You're Edward, right?"\n\n"Yeah..." Edward replied. He took a step back, alarm bells ringing in his head. How the hell did he know his name? "Who are you?"\n\n"Oh, me?" The man laughed. "Derik. We went to middle school together." Edward nodded. "Nice talking to you, Derik." He jumped into his pickup and turned the ignition. Nothing. Fuck.\n\nHe tried to start the engine three more times before giving up. God damnit. The mortgage was due, no food in the house, and now the truck was dead. "Fuck!" He jumped out and kicked the truck. The other man; Derik, watched silently. Then, "Rough night?"\n\nEdward sighed.

Andre grabbed a stapled, crumpled, and damp-smelling letter. The letter was a great example of the most common piece of writing sent to RFK: A man from Georgia explains in a five page long essay that the "...institution of segregation will remain eternal in the American Deep South." The audacity and stunning conviction of that made Andre think that no possible letter could be worth sending to the President. Moments after picking up another letter, he changed his mind. A letter from a young girl attending Harvard, RFK's alamater, expressing her positive opinions on his policies regarding civil rights.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the President opened up the new re-packaged letter, to read about a young girl's message to the President.

"The NPP's Far-Right is taking this personally." \n\n"Can you blame them?" Vice President Gore said. "They've been arguing to increase America's nuclear deterrent for decades. Regardless of whether they vote with us or not, they probably feel stabbed in the back." \n\nVance nodded wearily.

It was taxing, it was beneath him, and most dangerously, it was sloppy tradecraft. Though the SS had taken every measure to ensure that the Ordensstaat was impervious to infiltration, there could be no complacency in the execution of the Plan. \n\nUnfortunately, for a task as vital as inserting a pawn within the National Progressive Party - senior enough to directly manipulate the President of the United States - he also could leave nothing to chance. \n\nThe Reichsführer-SS ensconced himself with his advisors for hours, mulling how to approach their mark without arousing suspicion. He consulted with the spymasters of the SS, evaluating potential marks. For a short while, he conferred with Dittel on how to word the crucial message. \n\nFinally, he was done. He handed his personal directive to the assigned handler, who would decamp to Brest before presenting himself to his target as a merchant from Brittany, for as long as would be needed."

Relations between the Center and the Far-Right were difficult to manage on most days; if things ever fell apart, they'd need a private warchest to keep the Far-Right going. The President couldn't be bothered with this kind of work, and the NPP was a leaky ship at the best of times. \n\n"Bryce?" Agnew's pencil stopped. "H. Keith Thompson.

But it exists only on paper. Every so-called ringleader is a Gestapo double agent, every meeting room is bugged, and every recruited member is doomed. Its structure is ingeniously designed to root out subversives: a potential recruit is identified and approached by a Gestapo agent posing as a Brotherhood recruiter. They are brought to several meetings, and asked to do minor tasks to prove their loyalty: for example, stealing a crate of rifles from an (already-alterted) garrison. With their loyalty proven, they are asked to bring one or two trusted accomplices with them to the next meeting. There, they are all arrested and processed by the Gestapo.\n\nThe most challenging part of this plan will be building the reputation of this false organization. Underplay it in the media, and people will not hear of it; overplay it, and people will doubt the Ordensstaat's power. It will take careful planning by Office VII's propaganda wing in order to create the illusion that the group is expanding organically while still maintaining that the RHSA is adequate in fighting the threat, but we are confident that they can pull it off."

Although the numbers will eventually decline when would-be resistance members start to wise up and no longer fall for it, we hope to round up at least a couple thousand by the time the program is completed.

The results of the latest programs have proven that their ideas were ill-founded, and hundreds of would-be rebels have already been arrested for discussing subversive ideas in places they thought they would not be heard.

American cigarettes, Italian wines, and Brazilian bananas seem to be their most popular brands. A few summary public executions of smugglers and purchasers, combined with a more aggressive beach-combing operation along the shoreline to find light boats with contraband, should be enough to deal with the problem in the meantime.\n\nAs for the Dutch, it seems that most of their involvement is radical pan-nationalists seeking to incite dissent among the Flemish communities of the Ordensstaat.

There were caches of concrete barriers, sandbags, caltrops, dragon's teeth, and even a couple artillery pieces—enough to stop anything up to and including a panzer.

As my colleague mentioned earlier, while creating atomic-proof facilities for an estimated four hundred thousand people is a challenge, it is within the parameters faced by Organisation Todt during the War, and with enough funding doable within a four to six year period. Now, the rail network for Project Lifthrasir is a whole other matter. Even with the hundred and sixty thousand subjects that are in the process of being resettled in the Alpine region, that leaves us two hundred and forty thousand subjects, eighty thousand of whom are considered critical, primarily located in the Paris, Aurelstadt and Elsass regions. My proposal is as follows. Three four-lane subterranean rail lines encased in reinforced concrete at a depth of 11 meters. Since we will only have time for a single departure in the estimated 21 minutes before impact in a surprise attack scenario, I propose using the extant Paris Metro as a temporary shelter for non-critical personnel...""

Still, rumor swirls in the academic community of our nation that they were tipped off by an insider, and many professors, architects and engineers are all blaming each other for the leaking. We must act soon to suppress this information leaking wider, not only to stop the world from finding out, but also to ensure our scientists don't all murder each other."

One potential challenge is the native legions, as they present an uncertain variable in our calculations. As such, the Reichsführer has decreed that the silo construction in the vast Ardennes forest and in the brambles of the upper Loire Valley is to be kept discreet and with minimal information to the local strongmen about the ongoing construction and its purpose.

I believe one or more of our enemies are involved. I want the two of you, my best bookkeeper and most trusted soldier, personally on site to investigate; an office in Antwerp and a staff car have been set aside for you.

Thus, his annoyance at being woken well after even his own remarkably late bedtime was quickly replaced by a giddy eagerness towards whatever global crisis could warrant his personal intervention, in turn fading to a soft horror as he realized it could be THE Crisis. The Plan was not ready, the Aryans were not safe yet, he needed more time, at least a few more months... Steadying himself and banishing such unworthy angst, he picked up the phone on the ninth or tenth ring.\n\n"You have reached him, what is it?"\n\n"Mein Reichsführer, I assume you can recognize my accent. It's Bert Eriksson, from Division Langemarck?"\n\n"I know you. What is so urgent you need to wake me?"\n\n"I have heard rumors about your men coming to Antwerp to investigate the loss of... sensitive goods, bringing in an investigative team from Paris. I would like to tell you this is not necessary, Langemarck already has the investigation well in hand. We have been on the trail of missing military gear and supplies for months, we believe it is the same thieves involved, Resistance sympathizers."\n\n"Then I should definitely come, we cannot risk any rebels getting their hands on these... sensitive goods."\n\n"With all due respect Reichsführer, it would be highly dangerous and irresponsible for leading German officers to barge into a hotbed of terrorist activity and assassinations like Flandern. Not to mention it would be seen as an insult to Division Langemarck if their leadership do not explicitly trust them to catch some terrorists. Please Sir, we have this well in hand, do not risk the stability of the Ordensstaat over some thefts. Have your men work with me instead, this can be resolved with local finesse.""

Bert Eriksson, Oberführer of the Division Langemarck, has spoken with us and assured us that rapid discovery and punishment is the fate of all those who desire to steal from the good, law-abiding Aryan citizens of Antwerp.\n\nSources that wish to stay anonymous have informed this newspaper that the alleged criminals are radical marxist terror groups of primarily mixed-race individuals who desired to sell their stolen goods to Breton smugglers to fund their war against the New Order. One source insists it was in fact the theft of the coconuts which really exposed the heinous crimes of the terrorists, as they were seen leaving with the highly recognizable crate. From all of us here at the Antwerp Beobachter, we say "Take that, terrorists! Your ploys can never escape the sword of Justitia for long! May Division Langemarck hunt you all down!" May justice be dealt to these foul thieves."

Fourteen terrorists were killed in the ensuing firefight, bringing the total number of liquidated terrorists and sympathizers in the proceedings of the investigation to two hundred and three. Sixteen crates of rifles and computer panels were seized. The remaining supplies have yet to be located, but three terrorists were caught alive. Two of them sadly expired on scene due to wounds sustained, and the last suffered a fatal heart attack after a mere seventeen hours of questioning. The interrogator has been reprimanded for overeagerness. Still, the suspect revealed the location of the remaining supplies as being with a man called "Pierre from Nantes." Division Langemarck will put all available resources towards locating this suspect and terminate him and potential buyers of the missing items with extreme prejudice."

While suspicion lies primarily with the workers involved with shipping the goods, it is possible they have been stolen already on the factory floor. Sadly, our investigations along these lines have turned up little besides the odd Resistance sympathizer and illegal newspapers. It seems we may never know the extent of the scheme for absolute certain, but hopefully this show force will have put the scare in potentially disloyal factory workers. The arrested can keep working, as slaves, and on our premises."

As his subordinates rushed to throw the body in the pile with the eleven previous workers who had refused to cooperate, he turned to Eicker, an almost comical sight in the large leather coat he wore to conceal him as just another SS commander, yet still the one in charge given his seniority.\n\n"No luck, Sir. It's the same as in all the other factories here in Antwerp. The scum won't talk. All over Flanders our men keep finding nothing in the factories, yet the materiel keeps disappearing even with all our purges of the shipping staff. It must be going missing from the factories."\n\n"That much is obvious even to me, Peiper. So many of the workers would not have been so tight-lipped if they were not concealing something, the ones that truly don't know anything are the ones who make up their desperate stories to avoid being shot."\n\n"Then why did you have me shoot them, Sir?"\n\n"Because they lied to their betters, Peiper. You have much to learn yet. Anyway, I think we might be onto something here, it might be better to bring in some proper interrogation staff from Paris to get this sorry lot talking about their masters. Incarcerate the rest, soldiers!"\n\nPeiper followed the elder SS officer out of the arms factory. "With all due respect, Sir, would it not save us more time and progress to go directly after Eriksson? He was far too eager to keep you away from Antwerp, he clearly knows more than he is letting on."\n\n"I am suspicious of him, but I cannot just hand over an SS Oberführer to Müller, it would cause big problems with Division Langemarck.

 BRG_nuclear.19.d:0 "Thanks to the intrepid investigative skill of the Reichsführer's representatives and the SD intervention team, we have located a significant amount of the missing supplies, located in a garage in an Antwerp suburb. Sadly, the family owning the garage have disappeared, and the railroad worker we interrogated to find it had a concealed cyanide capsule in a hollow tooth, allowing him to avoid naming his employers before expiring. The interrogation of hundreds of industrial workers also experienced numerous cases of similar pills being used for suicide, suggesting the mysterious thieves commands significant loyalty from their supporters. Most importantly, multiple stashes of the missing war equipment was located, showcasing clearly that it was primarily stolen by treasonous factory workers. In his wisdom, the Reichsführer has decided cutting off the source of the thefts is enough for now, and have ordered the workers of the factories to be reassigned to work camps in Wallonien, with loyal workers from Paris taking their place in the factories. There should be no more problems in the future. It seems the puppetmasters will elude us for now. "

Normal construction work and operation in our factories can resume and our missing smallarms and gear have been returned."\n\nThe room erupted in applause from the assembled SS officers, the usual self-congratulatory nonsense Joachim Peiper loathed. He was the only one present not applauding, so after a pause to consider whether he should, he clapped his hands three times, slowly. The room went silent as everyone turned to him.\n\n"Impressively efficient indeed, Oberführer Eriksson, but you forgot something. These... bandits you were pursuing, they were also thieves, no? So where is what they stole? The Reichsführer will want to know."\n\nEriksson gave a sly grin. "I assure you, Langemarck is hot on the tail of the stolen... items. The Reichsführer will indeed know very well the location viability of any recovered fuel and computer parts once they have been safely brought to their rightful destination."\n\nSomething about Eriksson's statement and unusual bluster seriously unnerved Peiper, and while he smiled and nodded for the Oberführer to continue, he made a silent mental note to conduct his own little private investigation."

The calls have made clear that Charlemagne and its divisional head, Brigadeführer de la Mazière will take it as a direct insult if they are not trusted with the handling of nuclear materials. While obviously it would be a minimal risk for us to entrust Charlemagne with this, given their great loyalty to our cause, giving concessions to them risks inflaming tensions with Langemarck.

This is certainly true of its most recent incarnation, as a patchwork of two governments united only by the desire to hold off the influence of the Reich.  But it has been this way for a very long time.  The peninsula has never known Aryan rule, having been settled by lesser peoples of southern Europe.  Greeks, Phoenicians, Lusitanians, and more.  All of these peoples became a stew of new languages and nations, from the savage Moors to the bizarre Basques.  And this is to say nothing of their centuries of vile Jewish influence.  Altogether, Iberia is a patchwork of inferior peoples that should never have become one unified power.  But this is also an opportunity for us.  Many of these peoples-Basque, Catalan, Asturian, Galician-seek independence from the central government.  Moreover, the Iberian state occupies a unique position on the world stage.  Its economy has been wrecked by the Gibraltar Dam, but it also finds itself in control of the thing.  It has a sizable overseas colonial empire.  In short, there is a great deal of room to further our ambitions through the strange, impure amalgamation that is the Iberian Union."

Its location at the gate to the Mediterranean and the European continent makes the prize of a friendly Iberian polity too valuable for the great powers to resist interfering in the conflict, and tensions are sure to escalate across the globe as they find themselves backing rival factions.\n\nThere is much work to be done. Plans must be adapted, and new ones made. Assets must be activated and put to work.

The Portuguese loathe the Spanish, and the Castillian Spanish loathe the Portuguese almost as much as they loathe the various minorities in their nation, who loathe them back. It seems the only ones the whole peninsula can agree to loathe are the natives in their colonies and the concept of competent government. Without the strong state seen in our Ordensstaat, Iberia fumbles in the dark, always at the brink of immeasurable violence.\n\nLike a house of cards, all we need is one little push on the right card, and it will all come crumbling down.

Not every faction can be as willingly subverted as our friends the Asturians, but that can easily be remedied using our strategically placed insiders. False information about another political faction making it seem the weapons come from us here, a bit of propaganda there, and maybe some slight application of bribery, blackmail and political smearing where necessary. \n\nIf we can continue to successfully wrangle the separatists using our insiders, it may be time to begin considering withdrawing some of our German agents from Iberia, to lessen the risk of detection."

With Salazar holding the reins of power, Iberia would stagnate, more obsessed with retaining old glories than building a state for the modern world.  More importantly, it would be a state that crosses lines in order to achieve dominance over new parts of the globe.  In Algeria, especially, Salazar's Iberia would push its luck, perhaps too far.

The Ordensstaat will supply these groups with all the guns they could ever need.  In return, the profits from this arms smuggling will bring liquid capital back to the Ordensstaat.

They must be weakened, by any means possible, so that they can eventually be killed to a man. It is understated to say that every moment the world continues to tolerate their existence is an affront to civilization and to humanity.\n\nSecondarily, it is incumbent upon us to select among the other warlords one who is most useful to us as a counterweight in the east against our rivals, and to do what we can to either turn the others to his side or else see to their collective ruin. One candidate looks particularly promising, and has even rendered aid upon our Führer once before: the warlord of Vyatka, a man who would style himself an emperor, and would surely not rebuff our assistance in reclaiming his birthright.

War material is hard to come by in West Russia, and this attack will significantly hamper both our weapons stockpiles and our logistical capabilities going into the near future.

Someone back in Paris had picked them for him, just like they had picked his background. He was a river merchant, from a farm village outside Murygino. He had three children: two daughters living with his wife, and a son that died in the war. Which war he died in, and fighting which enemy, depended on who he was speaking to at the time. His identity was eminently plausible, both common and dreary enough to not inspire much questioning. He'd never gotten accustomed to living as 'Simeon', though. Russia was too hostile and alien for him to ever feel at ease here. He mostly stayed by himself ever since arriving, and every time he had to talk to someone—like today—all he had on his mind was the need not to give himself away.\n\nConstruction was underway in Vyatka. An impressive looking port facility was being built along the river, at the behest of the local Tsar. Rumour abound of a plan by the Tsar to earn himself a war chest manufacturing vodka, and it was just that sort of rumour that 'Simeon' was eager to exploit. A medium sized bribe was enough for him to be sat in an office opposite the Crown Representative to the port, discussing a trade agreement Simeon was sure would be too enticing for the bureaucrat to resist. His ships would sail into Vyatka to unload potatoes collected from farm towns connected to the river, and on their way out of the city again, those same crates would be filled with bottles of the Tsar's vodka. Of course, the potato crates would hide secret compartments hiding bullets and disassembled rifles, and many of Simeon's crew were secretly more SS agents. The port bureaucrat didn't need to know that, though. All he needed to see was a friendly smile from a local merchant, eager to make a profit for himself and his Tsar."

They each had their own tale to spin about why and how they arrived here, some talking of famine and others explaining away their peculiar manner of speaking with stories about their far away origins.

From there, they produced an extremely efficient printing and inking complex, producing hundreds of propaganda posters a day advertising the campaigns of extremist political parties in the so-called 'Komi Republic'. Decrying the dangers of imminent onslaught from the likes of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the posters depict a Komi Republic on the precipice of destruction, the Red Army about to arrive and crush all of the republic's citizens beneath its boot.

Oktan rightfully views Vlasov as a submissive underling to the Reich, a man who betrayed his own people to serve a foreign power, and is justly hated for it by all men from Samara to Arkhangelsk. Oktan has his own ambitions, and leads a troupe of Vlasov's high ranking subordinates who wish to see the traitor warlord replaced. They have their own silly beliefs about what will happen afterwards, imagining that Oktan can lead Russia to find greatness, but their sad delusions are not of any concern to us. All that matters to the Reichsführer-SS is seeing Vlasov's head on a pike, and Oktan can deliver that.

BRG.5014.t:0 "A Meeting at Midnight"
BRG.5014.d:0 "There was a stillness on the river Ob that night. A sense of emptiness, a hunger. It was as if every plant and animal was holding their breath. There was no moon in the sky. The stars were concealed behind clouds. There was only blackness. Gaping, yawning, waiting. \n\nAnd then, just past midnight, a man stepped into the clearing. He looked up at the empty sky, down at the cold dark water, and then intently at the path from which he had come. He too was silent. He too was waiting. \n\nNot much later, a second man arrived. The two men glanced at each other, and without speaking drew small coins from hidden pockets. Twin runes were set on the silver, barely visible amidst the darkness. \n\nThe first man was a river-trader, a well known pillar of the community in Vyatka. He was known to give alms to the beggars and candy to the children. The second was a printer from Komi. He was a recluse, but would sometimes come to gatherings. When he did, it was a cause for great celebration, as he told stories of enemies near and far, battles one and battles lost, of heroism and tragedy. \n\nThey were agents of the SD division of the SS-Burgundy. They had one purpose: to unleash chaos and cruelty among the Russian lands, and so further the higher purposes of the Reichsfurher-SS.\n\nThe Agents spoke quietly, quickly, and with as few words as possible. Their work in the west was done, it was time to bring the rightful punishment of the Untermensch to Siberia, and move Operation Bar one step closer to completion."
BRG.5014.a:0 "The Shadow State has a far reach."

 BRG.5015.t:0 "A New Arrival"
 BRG.5015.d:0 "There were many empty houses in the city of Orenburg. More often than not the refugees had brought large families that preferred safety in numbers, and the city had lost many of its residents in the wars and raids. The residents of the "Vienna of the Urals" had grown used to the derelict buildings, and were thus rather surprised when overnight one of the hovels transformed into a thriving business. \n\nA new printmaker had arrived, moved in from Komi. He was a genial fellow, who preferred to speak as little as possible of his business and much more about the hectic politics of the Russian wastes. It was unclear who exactly used his business, but they surely seemed to be generous as the presses were turning day and night. In time, the townsfolk grew used to their new neighbor, and ceased to wonder about such things. After all, they were just suddenly realizing the grave danger their precious city state was in, as the great warlords to the east and west alike hovered predatorily overhead. The other nearby principalities were experiencing a similar burst of suspicion and fear, and old wounds and grievances between the Ural states soon resurfaced. \n\nEach passing day seemed to bring another wild rumor of the cruelties and madness of enemies near and far, spurred on, just maybe, by the extraordinarily well-designed fear-mongering posters that had sprouted on every corner. Meanwhile, the printshop stayed lit and humming well into the night, as Orenburg's newest citizen told his stories and performed his dark work."

 BRG.5016.t:0 "Anger and Hate"
 BRG.5016.d:0 "In a place as chaotic as the Russian Wastes, in a state as new as ours, it is only to be expected that the public might be...skeptical... about submitting to the lawful authority. However, it seems that this understandable impulse has escalated into a full blown plague of disillusionment and rebellion. Everywhere the public heaps scorn on our government. Old women spit on our soldiers. Little boys throw rocks at the heads of our magistrates. Unless we do something soon, our control over West Siberia might well be short lived."
 BRG.5016.a:0 "We must do better."

 BRG.5017.t:0 "In the Dead of Night"
 BRG.5017.d:0 "It was midnight, the ground around the arms depot was shiny with frost, reflecting the stars above. Despite the chill, the soldiers were drowsy from a long day of training, and all but asleep on their feet. Suddenly from within the main storage building, there came a colossal explosion. The guards were thrown forward, and though they survived with only minor injuries, they could only watch helplessly as a great portion of our arms stockpile went up in smoke. This is but one of many incidents seemingly aimed at sabotaging our ability to wage war, and no doubt the fault of those two-faced traitors in West Russia."
 BRG.5017.a:0 "Find who did this, immediatly!"

 BRG.5018.t:0 "Dark Waters"
 BRG.5018.d:0 "Mikhail underlined the number at the end of his ledger. Excellent, another node on his expanding network of river traders had begun turning a healthy profit. Leaning back in the leather chair he had recently set up in his warehouse, he lit a cigar. The real Cuban stuff; the shipping cost alone to get this in via Finland and downriver to Vyatka meant the box had cost him the same as a pre-war car would have. But some luxuries a man of his wealth co- \n\n"Numbers are looking good, I see?"\n\nMikhail's instincts from a war long ago and decades working in one of the most dangerous professions in the Russian Anarchy kicked in the second the German-accented voice floated out of the dark of the warehouse. His hand found the lovingly maintained Tokarev hidden under the armrest of his chair, and within seconds he had adopted a standing firing stance. When he saw the figure emerge out of the dark, he however lowered his weapon. "Werner? You mad bastard, I almost shot you! What are you doing in Vyatka? I've never seen you east of Kostroma!"\n\nThe pale, skeletally thin Volga German held up a cigarette, and Werner lit it with his cigar. "You are one to speak about where I should and should not appear, Mikhail. You know as well as I do that we rarely had to meet because of our man in Komi. Without him, I sometimes have to make these trips myself, as do you."\n\nHe took a deep inhale of the cigarette. "But enough about old times. I see you have made quite the name for yourself, you are trading all over West Russia now. This is good, your services will be needed if your... beloved tsar is to hold onto his realm."\n\nMikhail grinned; Werner's mysterious friend in Moskowien had always been his best customers.

That was the last one, now nobody who knew his face still drew breath. A shame he had been forced to neutralize such good friends and long-term business partners, but at the end of the day they were untermensch and he was an übermensch, there could never be permanent friendship between them in the eternal struggle of the races.\n\nThe pale Volga German turned to the Russian's safe, the one the trader had unlocked a thousand times in his presence. What idiots these Slavs were, no surprise the Old Führer had declared they should be scoured from the Earth with the other unworthy.\n\nHaving stuffed his suitcase with the Russian's collection of Reichsmarks, Werner hurried to the docks. All around him the city was abuzz with war preparations, he saw marching columns, propaganda posters and worried citizens discussing a return to rationing. The time was almost nigh, and Werner smiled.\n\nAs he entered the riverboat headed down the Volga-Kama network once plowed by Werner's smugglers, he noted the crew. Six of them, four passengers. One weapon, a rifle. Captain probably had a pistol too. Pathetic. Back in the day no riverboat would travel without an armed contingent. Sign of New Russia indeed. Oh well, should be a simple enough business taking them down once they approached Moskowien. It was time to go "home," finally see that supposed paradise his fellow SS men and the Reichsführer had created in Burgund. He raised his hat to the city behind him, whispering his goodbye so the crew would not hear him."

 BRG_wolf.1.t:0 "세계계획 볼프"
 BRG_wolf.1.desc:0 "The tentacles of the Ordensstaat stretch further and further across the globe, snatching up new tools for the plan of the Reichsfurher-SS. Globalplan Wolf focuses on one of the juciest prizes of all -- the Middle East. Already our agents have infiltrated the region, and now work to disturb the colonial order, wrecking havoc on global tensions and the supply of oil. Our short term focus is on excerbating tensions between the triumvirate rivals Italy and Turkey in Syria. A confrontation there would go a long way to unleashing a beautiful cycle of violence. In the longer term, we hope to make use of the gluttony and cowardice of the Egyptian King Farouk. In time, as our agents proliferate, we may consider even loftier plans."
 BRG_wolf.1.a:0 "A place of oppurtunities."

 BRG_wolf.2.t:0 "The Kings Folly"
 BRG_wolf.2.desc:0 "It is so convenient, that although we are certainly happy to help them on their way, the untermensch are often willing to be the agents of their own demise. In Egypt, the pathetic King Farouk is well known for his lust, luxorious tastes, and disdain for his people. Our agents are already well placed to lead the King to ever more exorbitant states, wrecking havoc on his nations economy and unleashing chaos throughout the region."
 BRG_wolf.2.a:0 "And his nation will bleed."

 BRG_wolf.3.t:0 "Laying the Bait"
 BRG_wolf.3.desc:0 "In the distant Southern Deserts of the Kingdom of Egypt, the nomads wandered miserably, looking for some humble hovel to spend the night. In the many farming settlements along the Nile, the peasants worked day and night for the chance to live another year, a future for their family, and maybe a small bottle of liquor to drain their sorrows. In the narrow streets of Cairo, the cityfolk begged and stole for a living, crouching in crumbling apartments devoid of light or water, despite the promises of the government that infrastructure improvements would be coming "soon".\n\nIn the palaces of King Farouk, it was party time. Exotic dancers from across the world gyrated on poles of solid gold, whole platters of caviar were passed around hors d'oeuvres, decorated cloth bags full of Cocaine were handed out as favors. The palace was always glowing with light, thundering with muscid, and reeking of the alcoholic excess within.\n\nFarouk was never one to be surpassed, and he out-drank the hardest German beer merchants and proprietors of Mexican tequila alike, he out-snorted even the most outrageous coke-addicts, and he ate more than a dozen portly British prostitutes combined.\n\nAround the king were clustered his closest friends and dearest enablers. For every line, bottle, and plate he consumed, they pressed two more in his hands. Despite their saccharine good cheer, they did not touch the delicacies themselves -- for they were true Aryans after all. This was merely another play in the game, one that would earn them profit in smuggling money yes, but more importantly one that would bankrupt the Egyptian government and bring the whole rotten untermensch edifice crashing to the ground."
 BRG_wolf.3.a:0 "The Third Circle awaits."

 BRG_wolf.5.t:0 "The East Aflame"
 BRG_wolf.5.desc:0 "Since the first untermensch crawled out of the slime to drag the Aryan down, the Middle East has been the focal point of global conflict. Never has there been a great power that did not seek to dominate this region's resources and strategic position -- the land of black gold, the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa, the birthplace of modern religion.\n\nNow once again the region is aflame with a three way proxy conflict between the Saudis and their puppets in the Muslim Brotherhood, the Arab Nationalist Baathists, and the remnants of Italian colonialism. Each of these factions is backed by one global power or another, all are heavily armed, and thanks to our help, at the point of war. Now is the time for us to begin a general process of turning the cold war hot, and bringing an end to the long era of weakness and Aryan servitude."
 BRG_wolf.5.a:0 "The land of oppurtunity."

 BRG_wolf.6.t:0 "A Favorable Outcome"
 BRG_wolf.6.desc:0 "Once more the Ordensstaat's subtle use of lesser factions has paid off. The winner of the Iranian civil war is permeated by our agents, and indebted to our influence. In hidden places throughout the Persian mountains, our bases pump out propaganda, weapons, and recruitment. Now with a stronghold near the current focal point of global tensions, we have the ability to exacerbate the ongoing oil crisis and support the faction most amenable to our interests. Soon the great powers of the world will be drawn into an unescapable conflict over black gold, one from which they are unlikely to walk away."
 BRG_wolf.6.a:0 "A critical gateway secured."

 BRG_wolf.7.t:0 " Globalplan Wolf begins the Hunt"
 BRG_wolf.7.desc:0 "To our most noble Lord, the Reichsführer-SS: \n\nIt has come to the attention of all of our operatives coordinating our overseas clandestine operations that the Italians are enduring a new crisis, delivering to us a new chance for intervention from the Ordensstaat; in particular, "Africa Orientale Italiana," or the East African territories ruled over by the decadent Italians, has lost all decent support from their miserably inefficient government and fallen to chaos to the native savages. It would be most opportune to begin our newly drafted potential operations in the Italian menace as pertinently as possible. \n\nWith all respect and honor,\n\nSS-Obergruppenführer Heinrich Müller"
 BRG_wolf.7.a:0 "Good, very good."

 BRG_wolf.8.t:0 "Globalplan Wolf continues the Prowl"
 BRG_wolf.8.desc:0 "To the Knight of the Ordensstaat, the Reichsführer-SS: \n\nThe time has come, once more, to look towards the continuous failures and opportunities for exploitation within the most despicable traitors along the Italian Peninsula. Our current intelligence reports indicate the massive conflicts exploding out from the Middle East has caused extreme plummets in stock investments towards "Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi," the most powerful Italian oil company and, in turn, the top provider of international oil across the world. Though the world market shudders, may we toast to this most glorious collapse of Italian power? \n\nWith all admiration and resolution, \n\nSS-Obergruppenführer Heinrich Müller."
 BRG_wolf.8.a:0 "Only fools and cowards live upon that deserted Peninsula."

 BRG_wolf.100.t:0 "Growing Corruption"
 BRG_wolf.100.desc:0 "For a state such as ours, free from the cowardice and petty "democracy" of years past, corruption should be but a shadow of itself, and yet we seem to be unable to ever cleanse ourselves of it entirely. This has recently been especially true in our Middle Eastern Arab-Majority territories, where there has been a dramatic increase in embezzlement and bribe taking. It seems that nearly every low-level official has been implicated in some way, and several mid-tier beuracrauts as well. Although the highest echelons of our administration appears as surprised by this turn of events as we are, we must act quickly lest our hold over the region be rotted out from within."
 BRG_wolf.100.a:0 "Start clearing out the rot."

 BRG_wolf.101.t:0 "Terrorist Attack"
 BRG_wolf.101.desc:0 "It seems that there is no end to our troubles in the IME. No matter how many resources we throw at the region, it seems that every month brings some new terrorist attack or urban uprising. This time it was one of the former, a carefully coordinated series of explosions that killed a number of Italian soldiers and administrators, along with a heavy civilian toll. Although many different groups have claimed responsibility, the most likely true culprit is undoubtedly the Turks. In time perhaps we will be able to bring justice to these fools and sabotours, but for the mment the only thing to do is rebuild."
 BRG_wolf.101.a:0 "Damn the Turks."

 BRG_wolf.102.t:0 "Foreign Support"
 BRG_wolf.102.desc:0 "It is rare that we receive good news from the Levantine region, where every day seems to bring news of new troubles among the locals and sabre-rattling from our enemies. However, our troops have recently received an enormous shipment of weapons and equipment from allies “sympathetic” to our cause. Although the weapons are unmarked and untraceable, and there is no way to confirm the veracity of this claim, they are also of high quality deep necessity. Whoever this mysterious benefactor is, we will be greatly indebted to them should the growing tensions in the region boil over into open conflict."
 BRG_wolf.102.a:0 "We give our thanks."

"Dedicated and disciplined, curious, yet intriguing." the Führer pondered, as he approached the Commanding Officer of the Freikorps units. "Oberstleutnant Käufer, I have been told? You and your men shall be greatly rewarded for your service towards the true patriots of the German Reich and the rightful heir to become the Führer. I must ask, of course: where is it that you and your men hail from?" \n\nA tense moment of silence adorned the conversation beyond the smiles, as the Oberstleutnant's bright eyes locked with Göring's pale, steely eyes. "Stuttgart, my Führer." the Commanding Officer stated as he offered the Führer a salute. As Göring addressed the Stuttgarter, he could not help but question the intentions and information given by this Oberstleutnant Käufer. However, as Käufer and his men walked away, Göring acknowledged that these men would fight for him, and that's all he needed."
