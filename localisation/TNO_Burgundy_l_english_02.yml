 BRG_collapse.1.desc:0 "역사를 보면 서양 문명의 발흥과 몰락은 똑딱이는 시계에 달려있었습니다. 남자와 여자, 어린이의 죽음에서부터 세계 전역의 왕국과 제국에 이르기까지 이 모든 것은 시계가 지배하는 것으로, 이 소리는 우리 발 앞에 무릎을 꿇어야 할 수많은 열등인간의 삶과 심장 박동을 형성하는 동시에 시간을 엄수하는 아리아인의 마음 속에 울려 퍼집니다. 진정으로 훌륭한 인물조차도 우주 시계의 똑딱 소리는 원수에 대항하는 우월한 사람의 피와 유전자 내에 계속 새겨진다는 것을 알고 있습니다.\n\n그리고 오늘날, 이 우월한 사람들은 세계와 전쟁을 벌이고 있으며, 기사단국의 강력한 전사들은 이 시계의 자비를 발견하고, 기사단국 그 자체는 역사에서 주인의 힘을 깨닫고 있습니다. 오늘날, 프랑스인은 삼색기를 흔들면서 공화주의와 민주주의의 필요성을 외치고, 영원한 지배의 의미인 것마냥 흉악한 수준의 부패에 빠져있습니다. 오늘날, 벨기에인은 24시간 내내 북방을 맴돌며 민주적 민족주의라는 소름끼치는 미명하에 야만적인 이웃이라 생각하는 플란데른인과 함께 정착한 아리안인을 살해하고 있습니다. 그리고 오늘날 과거 종교의 메시지가 비참한 "신앙"을 위해 충직하고 빈틈없는 시민들을 벗겨내려고 하면서, 나약한 가톨릭 신자는 꽃과 유대사회주의에 대한 징그럽고 기형적인 환상을 보며 시계를 부술려고 하고 있습니다. \n\n이 반역자들과 어울리는 모든 남자, 여자, 그리고 아이는 그들 자신의 사형 집행 영장에 서명하여 우주 시계가 준 시간을 멈추게 했습니다. 몇몇은 기사단국과 열전을 벌이기 위해 일어섰고, 우리는 이 세계를 지배하는 진정한 주인입니다. SS국가지도자는 명철함과 지혜 속에서 군대가 어느 쪽을 겨냥해야 할지 선택할 필요성을 인식했고, 똑딱거리는 시계의 축복 아래 우리에게 주어진 영광을 얻을 수 있었습니다."

 BRG_collapse.3.d:0 "첫날은 기쁨과 흥분이 가득했다. 그날 밤에는 슈츠슈타펠 연대와 그 장교들은 치명적인 공격을 받아 붕괴되었으며, 결국 민중은 하나의 대혁명으로 연합하였다. 우리는 함께 그들을 영토 밖으로 밀어내고, 우리 스스로 국가를 만들었다. 유럽 장교처럼 강경하고 전통적인 대령조차도 우리를 오랫동안 학살한 아리아인들을 상대로 군사적 성공을 거둔 것을 기념하기 위해 와인을 마시고 즐기는 것을 마다하지 않았다. \n\n그러나 전쟁이 진행되면서 그 첫 날의 기쁨은 시들해졌다. 전쟁이 지속될수록 수많은 사람이 죽었으며, 아리아인을 계속 밀어내는 동안 그들이 퇴각 후 남겨둔 그을리고 황폐해진 대지 위에서 피로감을 느끼지 않을 수 없었다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 우리는 아리아 브루탈리즘과 폭정에 지배되고 있는 위대한 시골의 잔해와 폐허를 지나 여정을 계속했다. 그 곳에서는 모든 유용한 공급 기지나 잠재적 라디오 기지가 박살나고 불탔다. 식량과 수원은 날이 갈수록 부족해졌고, 적의 퇴각 뒤에 남겨진 파괴에 따른 물자와 지원의 부족은 우리 대열의 내분으로 이어졌다. 완전히 파괴된 또 다른 잠재적 자원을 지나갈 때마다 피로는 더욱 커져만 갔다. \n\n돌이켜보면, 그 모든 것은 지금에 비하면 너무나 간단해 보인다. 파괴가 너무 심해져서 우리는 그저 계속 검게 그을린 폐허를 마주하게 되었는데, 그 곳은 일상적인 삶이 진행되는 곳이라기보다는 베르덩이나 솜의 전쟁터처럼 보였다. 거기서 우리는 참호를 팠다. 그리고 검은 태양이 일어났을 때도 있었다. 짐승의 파도가 움직이기 전 기관총이 지옥을 퍼부었다. 적에게 굴복한 옛 전우들이 구식 소총, 폭발물, 동포를 도살할 때 쓰던 참호용 단검 등 단순한 무기를 들고 우리 대열로 달려들었다. 이제 대령은 이 참호에서 내 옆에 누워 있다. 총에 맞은 그의 두개골에서 피가 흘러나와 내 입속에 고여가고 있다. 이제, 내가 할 수 있는 일은 여기서 죽은 척 하는 것이다. 적이 짐승처럼 우리를 샅샅이 뒤지지만, 나는 그들이 내 심장 박동 소리를 듣지 않기를 바랄 뿐이다."

 BRG_collapse.4.d:0 "일이 항상 이런 식인 것만은 아니었습니다. 무장친위대에서 가장 큰 집단의 사령관으로 임명되는 것은 기사단국 내에서 진정한 영광입니다. 그러나 영광스러운 성공이 국가와 SS국가지도자에 대한 명예를 의미하는 경우에는, 끔찍한 시기에는 그러한 성공에서 멀어지는 게 더 낫습니다. 그러한 성공은 오히려 실망을 안겨줄 것이고, 그러한 실망은 모든 죽음이 기사단국에 큰 손실이 되는 현재 전장의 상황을 감안할 때 때아닌 죽음을 초래할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 파이퍼는 쉽게 죽지 않을 것입니다. 아니, 그는 죽지 않을 것입니다. 만약 그의 계획이 친위대 앞에서 효과가 있다면 말입니다. \n\n한때 국가사회주의라는 이름으로 새로운 성공을 거두었다는 소식에 자부심과 만족감으로 밝게 빛났던 방은, 이제 폭풍과 하늘을 날아다니는 재에 가려져 어두워졌습니다. SS국가지도자의 집무실 입구에서 대화가 이어졌습니다. 대화는 우리의 성공, 아리아인 전통주의, 지도력 변화, 군사 교리, 실패 등 여러 주제를 다루었습니다. 여단지도자가 승리의 대가를 회고하며 새로운 생각을 앞으로 밀고 나갔기 때문에, 이 만남의 진정한 의미는 결국 사라지게 될 것입니다. 승리는 아리아인 병사의 피를 통해 이루어지기보다는 우리 산업과 추진 기술, 탄두를 통해 이루어집니다. \n\n그리고 여단지도자는 현재 처한 상황을 깨닫기 시작했습니다. 네 명의 남자가 돌격소총을 들고 여단지도자의 머리통을 날려버리기 위해 트럭을 둘러쌌기 때문입니다. 이는 파이퍼가 자신의 미래를 위해 바랐던 상황이 아닐 것이요, 그가 전쟁터의 쾌락과 입술에 묻은 열등인종의 피맛을 즐기는 것을 바랐던 것은 아닐 것입니다. 오히려 그는 이 전쟁의 다음 단계를 준비하기 위해 모든 핵무기 시설을 무사히 순회하기를 바랬을 것입니다."

 BRG_collapse.14.d:0 "Turonen had become the pinnacle of Aryan brutalist desires under our leadership. There, degenerates and advocates of corruption learned to kneel, or else face the wrath of the Germanic warrior should they desire to further corrupt the earth with their insufferable pleas for mercy and compassion. My growth there was slow, but calculated and meticulous. All plans and actions taken with precise estimation with a healthy dollop of cunning backing it, allowing me to climb until I was one of the city's prime members of leadership. \n\nNow, we sit at the head of a convoy, in a cramped steel truck spitting out noxious fumes, running away from the city I held so tightly in my grasp. Now, all plans of mine have fallen to ruin at the hands of the damned barbarians to the Northeast, those who think themselves so proud, so cocksure as to rise against the Aryans who have claimed this land for National Socialism, for the greatness of all of greater men who ought to dominate on this Earth. Threats of nuclear warfare after the destruction of Aurelstadt at the hands of the mongrels who deem themselves worthy of a European throne when they sit upon a throne built from degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism. We shall rise once more, past all of their bombings, no matter how many cities it takes. \n\nIt was then that the sonic boom happened, when the bright flash and cloud of smoke shot into the sky, and all of Turonen was enveloped in a wall of nuclear hellfire. All of the men turned and scowled, harrowed by the fear dealt from the atomic blast. One officer broke down in tears, clutching a secret Christian rosary he kept in his trench coat pocket while reciting a Judeo-Bolshevik Hail Mary. With the pulling of the trigger upon my Walther P38, and a crack through the air, all the men paid attention to the former officer, with a whole through his cheek and blood running out his mouth and down his cheek. The weak shall pay for their crimes which allowed for this downfall."

All of those who had fought so desperately to overthrow our justified claims over the beasts who ruled this land prior, all of them have mustered together to try to stab the great Aryan example to the world in the back, sending so much of our efforts tumbling down. Nevertheless, the Reichsführer-SS is a wise, strong leader, and under his leadership shall we deliver the Ordensstaat from this signature hell that our enemies have forged. Now, however, under the command of both the name of the Reichsführer-SS and the name of Peiper, the Ordensstaat shall reclaim a glorious shine on this world. \n\nDeep within the military complexes of the Ordensstaat, however, was where this process began. Day after day, it was not the assembly of troops, or the training of potential new recruits for high command, or the preparation and deployment of new equipment for the Waffen-Schutzstaffel which would earn us our victory. However, it was the newest Operation issued from the Reichsführer-SS. The immediate direction of nuclear production and resources towards one military operation, an action which shall find French knees quaking, Belgian and Flanderian hugging one another, begging for mercy and forgiveness, and the Catholics praying towards their false gods as they all bear witness to the might. \n\nYes, it may have been the operation of our armored and motorized divisions which helped us to win this war. Yes, the influence of our advanced firearms, exceptional artillery, masterful aerial combatants, and the overall might of the Aryan strongarm as it dealt blow after blow to our enemies, ensuring their spilt blood to be the key to the Second World War. But now, it shall be the might of the Aryan mind which wins this war, as Brigadeführer Peiper bore witness to row upon row of nuclear missile, preparing for operation to use against the decadence threatening the Ordensstaat."

 BRG_collapse.16.d:0 "From the perspective of the upper echelons of the SS-Burgund, the history and racial characteristics of the French people left a lot to be desired. After all, these were untermensch thrice beaten by the Aryan, destined to spend some small time serving their superiors material desires, and then soon doomed after the fires consumed the planet. Perhaps this was why, despite the fanaticism and loyalty that SS-Charlemagne had demonstrated during the Second Weltkrieg, they were shunted aside during the implementation of the Ordensstaat and the Burgundian way. \n\nAnd so it has led to this, as the allies of the SS-Bergund fought against it, and threatened to use the very weapons they had long cultivated as a tool for the great global transformation against them. It was this same arrogance that led the Reichsführer-SS and his closest advisors to assume that surely the French legions would not dare to use weapons of mass destruction against their German foes. After all, they were at their core cowardly and degenerate, and thus incapable of matching the will of the Aryan.\n\nBut the French SS legions had been for so long subsumed in the madness and hunger of the Ordensstaat that they had taken its ideology and made it their own. So when Himmler ordered his soldiers to continue the advance, the missles flew. The SS attack positions were obliterated, soon followed by their command infrastructure in the rear, and then the high value targets in the Burgundian interior.\n\nDid they think that there would be no retaliation? That the Burgundians would be too astonished by the nerve of their former puppets to respond quickly enough? Or that they might be lucky enough to kill the Reichsfurher-SS in their attack, and his dark state would die with him? No one can say. Perhaps they predicted a response, but chose to go into the darkness on their own terms with as many of the enemy following them as possible. \n\nEither way, the missles flew and the Shadow State, so long submerged in darkness and secrecy, burnt bright for moments before returning to embers. In time, a few survivors would crawl out into the radioactive wasteland, although few would last long."

 BRG_collapse.17.d:0 "What impact had the Wallonians made on history? What were their accomplishments, their triumphs, their meaning and purpose? Compared to the hallowed nations of great renown -- the Aryans, the Yamato people, the Americans -- very little. There were no stories of their feared strength, great constructions, or terrible victories. By the standards of the Reichsführer-SS and his minions, they were a people of small account -- just worthy of having their own small legion within the military of the Ordensstaat, to be quickly wiped out when the true designs of National Socialism were implemented. \n\nBut the arrogance of the Aryan led them to fatally underestimate their opponent. Although not nearly as numerous or well-equipped as their opponents, the SS-Langemarck matched them in the ability to unleash nuclear destruction. \n\n"Surely", thought the Riechsfurher and his close compatriots when the missive from their enemy was delivered, "such a small and worthless nation would not dare to challenge the Aryan in a truly total war". They were wrong. \n\nThe Walloonians turned out to be as good as their word, and unleashed a devastating salvo of atomic missiles upon the Burgundians, who promptly retaliated. Everywhere the camps and fortifications for which so many slave lives had been sacrificed were obliterated. The center of the Burgundian leadership, who had remained steadfast in their loyalty, proved unable to survive the fire, and vanished from the public eye."

While a short hard life in the camps is undoubtedly no more than these icompotent un-Aryan fools deserve, at the moment we are on the back foot as our soldiers rapidly retreat from the areas affected by the conflict.

Their proud rooster banners lie torn, their up-jumped leaders rot in the camps, and their soldiery awaits for our decision on what to do with them. \n\nFor the ring-leaders of this insignificant rebellion, there will be no mercy.

They will be allowed to keep their place in the barracks for now, but will be assigned to only the most menial tasks, until they show themselves worthy of more. Finally, the Walloonians who showed themselves as truly dedicated to the Reichsfurher by joining in the liquidation of their own battalion will be rewarded, promoted, and carefully watched lest they show any sign of the errant nationalism mof their fellows.

Some thought they should be placed permanently beneath the boot of the Riech, but still given autonomy. A few overzealous souls went so far as to suggest that they should be liquidated entirely, like the Jews and other untermensch.\n\nAs always, it was Reichsfurher Heinrich Himmler who saw the true way. The French would be allowed the privilege of life for a moment beneath the Aryan. Their culture would be stripped from them, their people relegated to servitude, but for a choice few. For the most loyal, the most honorable, the handful possessed of some glimmers of Aryan lineage, there could be another station: service within the SS-Charlemagne. \n\nBut like the pathetic dogs they are, these cowards took the Reichsfurher-SS' generosity, and threw it in his face. They dared to plot and scheme against the Ordensstaat, apparently unaware of the doom that they brought down upon themselves. Now their proud armies, in their mind equal to that of the Aryan corps lie in ruins. Their leaders are in custody, their equipment and arms has been seized, and new prison camps have had to be constructed for the sheer number of captive enemy soldiers.\n\nWe will deal with them according to their actions in this struggle. Those that turned against us will be liquidated forthwith in the firing line or in the camps. Those that stayed loyal will be promoted but observed.

It is clear that this was no partisan effort. The coordination of the attacks was unthinkable, and the explosives used were clearly of a high grade.\n\nThe only that remains is: who? Who has the capacity and intelligence to cripple our fuel network overnight? As of now, our only estimation is that this was an undertaking by either the Americans or South Africans, using the vast American intelligence networks to determine at which arteries they were going to strike.\n\nWe cannot sustain such a strike again.

As war rages in Africa, Hüttig has begun to lose not only his temper, but his mind. This shall work beautifully. For every day the war drags on, and for every bullet of effort Ostafrika contributes, Hüttig is driven closer and closer to a mental break which could cost the lives of millions, or perhaps even more.\n\nIt is time to reach out to Hüttig, to let him know that his Burgundian masters are soon to arrive with direct front line support.

The lavish receptions which were so meticulously plotted out were left abandoned. The accommodations for Burgundian troops left vacant. The only trace of the European SS left in the city was the dust kicked up by their motorcade on the way south.\n\nFor the Burgundians have not arrived to wine and dine, nor have they arrived to collaborate with others. They have come to Afrika seeking blood, and they seek to do so by their own accord.

The sight of Heinrich Himmler in the flesh was not a common one for an SS officer, and they made sure to be on their best behaviour. There were severe consequences for anyone who lapsed in their discipline in the presence of Himmler.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS did not usually deign to oversee the executions of prisoners personally. Truthfully, Himmler found death distasteful. The sight of gore disgusted him, and he was not present here just so that he could revel in it like some depraved sadist. He did not intend at all to prolong the dying of this prisoner; a gunshot to the back of the head was sure to be quick and clean. Himmler's personal attendance was purely one of ceremony, and poetry. This man, 'Grouès', was the leader of the resistance: the head of the body of the last group of truly free Frenchmen left alive. His death meant something—in dying, he would be the last breath of the French spirit. Ending his life would also destroy the soul of the nation that Himmler despised more than any other. He wasn't here to execute a man, he was here to execute France.\n\nSteel pressed against the prisoner's head, his body stood taut by guards. Himmler's gun nestled against his skull, ready to fire. His eyes drifted away for a second, his gaze turning from Grouès. That exact second was when he fired. He only needed to feel the kickback in his hand to know the man was dead. Himmler withdrew a cloth to clean his hands, and departed the room again. Thrill and pride and relief all washed over him in equal measure as he made his way back down the hallway. This time he stopped for a moment, halfway down the path, and looked back to make sure the guards had addressed him correctly. There was still more for the Reichsführer-SS to do."

Every peasant tending the fields or laborer working the factories who had ever thought, "Is this the life for me? Should I escape?" was now dead too.\n\nMany still seemed alive, of course. They breathed, and ate and slept. They did their daily labor. Maybe they even still had a stray errant thought. But the rebel inside them was dead, just the same as all the rebels who had ever taken up arms were dead. They were spiritually dead. The zeal of the Frenchman or the Belgian or any other dead country was gone from them. They did entertain for more than a moment the thought of resistance. They knew who was in charge, who ruled them. They understood their inferiority, even if in their minds they did not use that word.

For the former, they are dictated what meals they can eat and when. For the latter, they are still given plenty of leeway, and are only limited in their ingredients.\n\nBut why must it be this way? Why should the average workingman not be given the same guidelines as his comrade in the trench? Would it not serve the Volk if they were given the same kinds of nutritious, filling, and easy-to-produce meals?"
 BRG_specialized_assistance_desc:0 "Nowhere in the world have the fires of industry burned so hot as in the Ordensstaat. Momentous strides have been taken by the administration of the Reichsführer-SS and by the Aryan people to transform the Ordensstaat into the workshop of the world. With such a surge in industrial prowess has come the development of a large population of industrial specialists and logistical experts.\n\nWhilst their skills are most suited to industrial production, they may yet be rather effective in agricultural planning. As such, plans shall be drawn up to reorient German specialists to fine tune the fields rather than the forges, should the need soon arise."
 BRG_expand_rodomo_sillos_desc:0 "The Aryan man may labour tirelessly in his fields, reaping harvests unforeseen in their bounty. Yet, without the proper facilities to store the fruits of Aryan labor, it would all be for naught. The grain will rot and the German people will go hungry. Such a state of affairs shall not come to pass, as the Ordensstaat undertakes a grand expansion of the food storage and distribution network.\n\nThis network shall be centered around the facilities of Industriebezirk Rodomo, wherein the labourers shall erect large, central storage facilities, as well as distribution centers in tandem. Soon, agricultural yields shall go to waste no longer, as foodstuffs are distributed across the Ordensstaat in the most timely fashion."
 BRG_fields_of_grain_desc:0 "In order to feed the people of the Ordensstaat, agricultural yields must be increased. Of course, the land we tread upon is fertile, and ripe for agricultural purposes. Seizing the potential of our soil, however, will require no small deal of effort. To stave off disastrous famine, we shall construct large industrial farms, each tuned to reap the greatest outputs that the earth can provide.\n\nThe resources required for this undertaking shall be great yet necessary. Overgrown fields and untamed meadows shall be sown with grain as the silos of the Ordensstaat are made full once more. Such efforts will in most likelihood slightly slow our efforts at further industrialization, however, a laborer can offer no output should he fall dead by famine."
 BRG_food_for_those_who_matter_desc:0 "It matters not whether the people have enough to eat if the men guiding them are starving. If the Ordensstaat's leaders are malnourished, it risks putting everything that the Reichsführer-SS has worked towards in jeopardy. They will be sluggish and prone to error, and in the tense world of today, that cannot be tolerated.\n\nThe answer is clear, the leaders need to eat first. Starting with those the Reichsführer-SS has deemed to be of utmost priority, those of vital importance to the Ordensstaat shall have their daily fill."
 BRG_establish_priority_lists_desc:0 "The distribution of something as vital as food cannot simply be an ad hoc process. A comprehensive and standardized system is necessary in order to properly organize and maximize efficiency in the distribution of rations, while making sure that the most deserving get priority.\n\nEverything must be taken into account: age, rank, military activity, current office, past responsibilities, the state importance of their projects, recommendation from the Reichsführer-SS, no detail is too minor. The consequences are too large to leave anything up to chance."
 BRG_forget_outer_circle_desc:0 "Unfortunately, even within the SS hierarchy, there is not enough for everyone. The stocks are being depleted faster than some have projected, much to the chagrin of the Riechsführer-SS . He knows that some difficult decisions must soon be made about who will get limited supplies of high-quality food, and it is a sacrifice he is willing to make. After all, what is a more noble and virtuous way for an Aryan to suffer than for the good of his race and nation?"
 BRG_crack_the_whip_desc:0 "With the requisitioning of designated food supplies from the less desirable, and their re-allocation to those essential personnel who ensure that the Ordensstaat, we may rest assured that when food begins to run short and the apparatus of the state remain well fed, their loyalty will be without question.\n\nUntil then, there is much work to be done. From the laborers we must ask more, and from the people we must demand more service. Heightened quotas and increased conscription shall soon become necessary measures, and as such the people will inevitably become increasingly unruly. However, our loyal and well fed personnel shall ensure that the people do not get out of hand. We can rest assured of it."
 BRG_waste_not_or_want_not_desc:0 "With such a precious commodity being managed so carefully, the penalties for misappropriating it must be consequently adjusted to reflect its importance. To hoard and waste food in the middle of a declidate situation is the re-emergence of the same degenerate ideas that underpinned Jewish capitalism: using flawed judgement to place the individual's needs above those of the Volk.\n\nThe same approach must be taken. Negligent waste will result in arrest and interrogation by the Gestapo. Intentional waste or hoarding will merit a far more intensive process."
 BRG_emergency_stockpile_measures_desc:0 "Every able man is important to the Ordensstaat, yet some are more important than others. Senior officials, members of critical response groups and key state apparatus, and other such individuals instrumental to the plan of the Reichsführer-SS, must be preserved. As such, with a troubling famine looming closer upon the horizon with each passing day, we must take action to ensure that the resources are available to keep these personnel well fed. This will inevitably require the requisition of food allocations from those less deserving, who will face their reckoning in the coming struggles."
 BRG_develop_new_fertilizers_desc:0 "In the past, few things were more dangerous to a civilization than overfarming. They exploited the land to the point where it would make crops impossible to grow, and they would wither away and fade into history like the dying plants in the fields.\n\nThankfully, due to advances in the agricultural sciences, fertilizers allow farmers to restore the soil's nutrients and keep growing the same crops year after year. If the Ordensstaat is to survive and thrive, we must exploit this to the fullest extent."
 BRG_industrial_aids_desc:0 "National Socialists are not Luddites. Although they seek to preserve the physical and moral purity of the Aryan race through millennia, they recognize the value of modern industry and use it to better their environment. Agronomy is certainly no exception to this.\n\nThe traditional rural life of the future shall not be one with primitive farming implements. Plows and seed drills shall give way to tractors and combines."
 BRG_industriebauernhof_projekte_desc:0 "As industry was greatly expanded, this necessitated the centralization of the population into tight knit urban centers, so that men could work the newly built foundries and factories that dot the land. An ambitious urbanization effort was undertaken by the Ordensstaat, with many being incentivized or coerced into flocking to the cities. However, whilst a city may provide impressive outputs insofar as weaponry or industrial goods are concerned, it provides naught in terms of food, acting as a drain into which the Ordensstaat's food stores are offloaded.\n\nAs such, we are now faced with the difficult decision to roll back such initiatives, for the labourers are needed in the fields now more than ever. And they are needed with due haste. We will do what we must to drive the people back into the fields for now, even if we must demolish entire city blocks to achieve this."
 BRG_the_final_measures_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat has diligently undertaken all possible measures at its disposal to conquer the threat that the famine presents. The loyalty of essential personnel has been secured, the labor of the Volk intensified and mobilized, and previously untamed fields are now sown with grain.\n\nDespite all this, it was inevitable that those weaker and less deserving individuals in our society would perish in these hard times. It is no matter. Their mouths no longer need to be fed, and with this, our food stores shall soon begin to swell once again. With the weakest individuals sacrificed so that the Volk may be fed, and with the ingenious preparations orchestrated by the Reichsführer-SS, the famine shall soon be naught but a cold memory."
 BRG_a_second_try_desc:0 "The efforts undertaken by the Ordensstaat to stave off the great impending famine were monumental. Very few stones were left unturned in our quest to avoid troubling times. All appeared well, as our grain stores began to fill once again with fewer mouths to feed.\n\nYet it was not to last. The few stones that were left yet unturned have brought a reckoning upon the Ordensstaat, as famine has returned once more, like a painful memory come back to haunt the Aryan people. The few remaining stones from underneath which these troubles seep must be turned, regardless of cost."
 BRG_raze_the_cities_desc:0 "In order to meet the necessary quantities of grain to feed the populace in this increasingly complex crisis, radical measures must be taken. Measures which shall make all our prior efforts appear to be little more than token gestures. It begins with our centres of industry.\n\nWhilst the most industrious of our cities certainly produce well in the way of mechanical and industrial goods, it is undeniable that these regions also consume the most food, all the while producing none. If we are to solve this lingering famine in finality, we must raze these factories and pave the regions with great industrial farms, the likes of which are yet unseen in this world. We cannot dither in deciding between the grain or the cog. The cog will not feed the Aryan man nor will it nourish the laborer."
 BRG_survival_of_the_fittest_desc:0 "As the most radical of measures are undertaken, in the current short term we must face the disappointing fact that the food currently does not exist to feed all of the subjects of the Ordensstaat. As such, those who wish to be fed must prove their worth through a days' exceptional labour. Those who just get by and those who do not exert themselves to their maximum in all their labors shall simply not be fed. If prior enticements were not sufficient to encourage the workforce to produce good results, then surely the prospect of an empty stomach at the end of the day and an early grave shall act as a stronger encouragement."
 BRG_tighten_the_belts_desc:0 "Once before, when faced with famine, we had sufficient food in reserve to guarantee to the most essential and loyal soldiers of the Ordensstaat that they would be well fed and content. With the crisis growing ever more concerning, however, this may no longer be so. To ensure that all personnel have at the least something to eat, the rations of even the most loyal SchutzStaffel members must be cut. All, even the most crucial soldiers, must now do their part in self sacrifice for the cause."
 BRG_grab_it_all_desc:0 "Every day, those unworthy and unessential to the Reichsführer-SS's plans continue to fester within the Ordensstaat. Like a tapeworm, they feed upon provisions that were made to nourish the Aryan man. This will continue no longer. We will seize yet more provisions from those deemed unessential to the plans of the Reichsführer, so that those critical to the plan shall live. In the end of it all, the deaths of those being deprived do not matter."
 BRG_burgundian_diet_desc:0 "The German diet, the French diet, the Belgian diet. These are culinary traditions with hundreds of years' worth of influence, full of rich and vibrant characteristics that make them unique and treasured by chefs the world over.\n\nThey are also some of the most decadent, divisive, and un-Aryan ways of living ever known.\n\nIn this lean time, there is no room for sausages, chocolates, and fine wines. This must be a time of uniformity, a time of austerity, a time of singular devotion to the cause of the Reichsführer-SS's vision."
 BRG_nothing_shall_remain_desc:0 "As many essential individuals and German families throughout the Ordensstaat find themselves upon the brink of starvation, some seem to have scarcely taken notice. Many decadent bureaucrats and generals continue on with their needlessly excessive lifestyles, ignorant of the plight of the Ordensstaat. Lavish suppers, several course meals, desserts. For every one of their meals or functions, fifty aryan men could be healthily put to work.\n\nIt ends now.\n\nThis wastefulness will come to an immediate end. There may be backlash from the Charlemagne collaborators, but it matters not. Their pride and excessive living cannot stand, and their ire is much easier to face than the starvation of thousands of men essential to the plan."
 BRG_root_of_indulgence_desc:0 "As it turns out, there is, in fact, such a thing as wasteful food production. Indeed, not all food that is produced is conducive to our efforts at nourishing the Aryan people. With the inheritance of its territories, the Ordensstaat with it inherited the decadent established food industries so beloved by the degenerate Frenchmen. Cheesemaking. Wineries. All such lavish and excessive foodstuffs must be scuppered, for they are made irrelevant by grain and livestock. All focus must be put into those areas, and those areas alone. The Ordensstaat is not concerned with the fine dining of the fortunate few."
 BRG_some_can_stay_desc:0 "The Charlemagne collaborators, enriched in their cooperation with the Ordensstaat, are known for their lavish dining and decadent ways. Dinner parties and grand meals which could feed dozens of hard working Aryan men are instead swallowed by a fortunate few. It is revolting to think that for each time they dine, food is siphoned away from dozens of hard working Aryan men.\n\nHowever, the collaborators are regrettably essential to both the plan and the day to day operations of the Ordensstaat. We cannot risk their outright disapproval. As such, some of their particularly wasteful practices shall be disallowed, however nobody will pay a particularly watchful eye should they decide to continue with them regardless of regulation."
 BRG_needs_of_the_few_outwiegh_the_many_desc:0 "To further endear Charlemagne to the Reichsführer-SS, a proposal has been put forth: Grant the collaborators tracts of farmland to do with as they please, to feed themselves and their men, primarily. Of course, having large tracts of land from which we cannot extract the most efficient amounts of grain and livestock will reduce output greatly, and surely endanger the lives of many personnel who already rest upon the brink. Yet, despite what it shall cost in productivity and lives, the loyalty of Charlemagne is far more valuable."
 BRG_a_solved_problem_desc:0 "Finally, we may claim that no stone has been left unturned in combating the great famine. The Ordensstaat has undertaken all measures fathomable to ensure that in due time, the famine shall come to an end. As crops bloom and yields increase throughout the seasons, the troubles will come to an end in due time. That is not to say that our struggles have come to an end, for the famine will plague the Ordensstaat and its people for some time still. We simply need not worry, for now it is an issue which shall be guaranteed a resolution.\n\nFinally, we may turn our attention to the plans of the Reichsführer-SS, and do all we can with our current workforce before it continues to expire."

The Land of Iberia, both Hispania and Lusitania shall be the perfect place for our operation, as the man fighting for independence shall find himself purchasing their new weapon of war straight out of Aryan hands, and such great profits being distributed right back into the Ordensstaat's banks.

This is where we shall benefit, however: the Asturians are one such bunch, who believe that through natural work together, then they shall harvest the Earth and its glories. Their faults will be our aid, however, as they shall work the land to death by command of our leadership, whilst every single cent is handed towards the Ordensstaat's wealth, rather than bolstering their own ranks.

Iberia is broken, Spain is destroyed, Portugal is dead, and we have benefitted each and every step of the way, both in operations and in investments. The world has sunk its entire attention towards the blood which floods the lands of the peninsula, while the coffers of the Ordensstaat stand bloated from all of the sales and investments coming forth from the entirety of our actions across that accursed Peninsula.

While on one hand he is supremely unsuited for the role of Führer, being soft-hearted and tending towards tolerating politically and racially questionable characters, he also differs from his opponents through genuine competence and recognition of the Reich's many failings. That is however also why he must be weakened and pushed towards a more hardline policy. We cannot risk having him trying to turn back the clock to 1932, or worse, seek detente with the Japanese and Americans. As such, as much as it pains us, we must rally the supporters of statism and degeneracy against his rule; for the good of the race the Volk must be allowed to slide further."

While we don't mind him blaming that useless sot Heydrich, it was his damn conference that started it all in the first place, he also names the Reichsführer, Adolf Eichmann, and many other prominent Burgundians as partakers in these actions.

While normally we would be loathe to endorse such a useless waste of uniform material, the fool tied his cause heavily to the militarist faction of the Party and their allies in the Wehrmacht. Our primary goal should thus be to champion the militarist cause to drive conflict, while simultaneously undermining the False Führer's authority by denying him easy victories and economic stability. Plans must be drawn up at once."
 BRG_equipment_to_their_enemies_text:0 "Equipment for their Enemies"
 BRG_equipment_to_their_enemies_desc:0 "The bloated carcass in the Reichskanzellei has finally been goaded into initiating offensive operations against whatever unfortunate countries the militarists want to loot that day. Sadly, with the Aryan might of the Wehrmacht marching against them, few European countries could stand against them for long. If we are to slow down Görings successes and exaggerate his failures, we must ensure his potential enemies get a solid donation of firearms and military equipment from the "French State." It will be technically correct since we are a state controlling part of France."
 BRG_failure_for_their_friends_text:0 "Failure for their Friends"
 BRG_failure_for_their_friends_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, so with some strategic raids by "partisans" on the Heer's supply lines we can ensure the soldiers stay hungry, disgruntled, short on ammunition and are left generally in poor combat condition. Even if they still win, the road there will be long and tortuous, the blame pointing squarely at Germania."
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_text:0 "Find the Weak Links"
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_desc:0 "On the surface Göring's support base seems solid, but in reality many of his supporters view him with skepticism, for example the militarist leader, General Schörner. We must map out these voices and ensure their influence is strengthened both in the Party and Army, to push the Reich towards more aggressive policies."
 BRG_cut_the_strings_text:0 "Slash the Chains"
 BRG_cut_the_strings_desc:0 "With Göring's critics located and strengthened, we can begin taking active measures to split and weaken his support base. Before long, the Hero of the Luftwaffe will be the hero of very few with real power and influence."
 BRG_goodbye_goering_text:0 "Goodbye Göring"
 BRG_goodbye_goering_desc:0 "The False Führer's influence is diminishing by the day, he is now little more than a puppet of the militarists, left playing his incompetent games with the economy like a toddler locked in his room. With our newfound experience with leveraging the militarist network, we can drag him down even further into irrelevance."
 BRG_block_warplan_b_text:0 "Block Warplan B"
 BRG_block_warplan_b_desc:0 "Germania is planning new conquests. We must utilize the lessons we learned from our past interventions against them to plan out new means to sabotage the invasion. But first we must collect intelligence on the operation."
 BRG_another_shots_text:0 "Another Shot"
 BRG_another_shots_desc:0 "We need to provide more solid equipment this time around. Mortars, anti-tank grenades, shells... anything we can spare from the French armories we looted during our war with them. It is critical that the Wehrmacht keep getting bogged down in brutal fighting."
 BRG_another_road_block_text:0 "Another Roadblock"
 BRG_another_road_block_desc:0 "To improve the raiding of our "partisans", they will now be equipped with detailed maps of the logistics storehouses, machineguns to help suppress a potential counterattack by the guards, and plastic explosives to destroy anything that cannot be stolen. Things will not be easy for the Reich's soldiers."
 BRG_prepare_for_our_turn_text:0 "The Final Plan"
 BRG_prepare_for_our_turn_desc:0 "Somehow, Göring has managed to achieve his goals so far, albeit at a great cost to the Reich. To our joy, our spies in the Oberkommando now report that the delusional militarists are planning grand conquests for world domination that our foreign policy analysts pretty much guarantee will lead to a new world war. All we really need to do is make sure they are encouraged to continue."
 BRG_der_entruckung_text:0 "Der Entrückung"
 BRG_der_entruckung_desc:0 "It appears the latest target for Göring's wild ride of military conquest is... the Ordensstaat. This is unfortunate, but not unexpected. The Oberkommando in Germania is fearful about our nuclear arsenal, which we can use to our advantage. If we can rush the SS into German territory, local silo commanders or even the Oberkommando themselves might panic and order the deployment of part of their nuclear arsenal. With how tense the Americans and Japanese are over German resurgence, that should be more than enough to trigger a global conflict. We must ready ourselves for Rapture, Ragnarök is upon us!"

 BRG_globalplan_adler_decisions:0 "§R세계계획 아들러§!"
 BRG_globalplan_adler_decisions_desc:0 "The Reich, what once was the glimmering hallmark of Aryan Masterdom against a world of putridity, in which the Vaterland would stand triumphant against the Judeo-Bolshevists who would dare call themselves equal to our mighty grasp, has since fallen into a despairful pit of decadence, sin, and treason. So great is the extreme putridity characterizing the Reich that it fell into its own horrific Civil War, pitting the Germanic Master Race against itself in a horrific gladiatorial arena throughout the Reich. Now, however, only one false Führer stands to call themselves leader of the Aryan people, gutting the strength of the Germanic people even more as they feed the bloated corpse of the Reich more lies every passing day in order to maintain the survival of their unholy power. However, while this sickly beast continues to crawl through the mud of this world to try to find power, the Ordensstaat poised to strike, ready to do all we can to bring down this fallen behemoth who once dared called themselves the masters of this solemn world. And with how deranged the country has become, it shall not be long until they aid greatly towards the Reichsführer-SS's plan..."

 ###Events

 BRG_adler.1.t:0 "Shadows on the Rail"
 BRG_adler.1.d:0 ""Agents Ten, Twelve, Thirteen, Thirty-Three, make way upon the railing above." Echoed the earpieces of the Aryan servants of the Ordensstaat's shadow. Thus, the men descended from the roof onto the dark balconies above, hidden away under the shadow of the night as their rifles came ready to use upon the floor below. \n\nThe factory doors came to a crash as the men entered the room, ready to meet just whoever so happened to have contacted the legendary Businessman of the Reich at this time of the night. "Uh, hello, anyone there?" said the Businessman, in the most regal attire of a trenchcoat as his guards smoked cigars. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." echoed a voice from the darkness, as a man took a few paces to greet the entourage upon their entrance into the area. "Supposing, at this time of the night, you'd enjoy the skipping of pleasantries so that business may be conducted?" the man said, adorned in mystery. Flick shook his head slowly in response. "Well, then allow me to begin. You see, there are elements of this world which lurk under the watchful eyes of Dictators, Generals, the Reich, and even the Führer himself, Herr Flick. Elements of this world which would like to see themselves involved in the meandering of Speerian governing, and are willing to pay handsomely for it." The man said, opening a briefcase full of Reichsmarks. \n\nWith the dark room laid to silence, Herr Flick continued to ponder the question for just a few minutes, until finally, his eyes brightened up. With a shaking of hands, the Reichsmark were taken that day, and the Ordensstaat had a way straight to Speer's heart. \n\n"Alright, gentlemen, lay down your rifles." the Man said, as the clambering of military gear being set down began."
 BRG_adler.1.a:0 "Terror to some, greatness for us."

 BRG_adler.3.t:0 "The Facade of a Million Shadows"
 BRG_adler.3.d:0 "The Office of the Führer deep within the Halls of Germania was once embellished with the great calls for glory from the illustrious Adolf Hitler, the marching, arm-locked-in-arm, of Generals discussing the glory of the Reich's conquests, and the countless citizens of Germania enjoying, for themselves, the Empire which gave them dominion over the world. Now, however, the Führer himself lies in silence, begging himself not to take another cigarette in fear of his health, hand clasped in hand, as he stares into the distance, telephone in hand. \n\n"My Führer, the ongoing protests within several of the Reich's universities are not, I repeat, not at the hands of remaining Civil War elements. A series of documents have been circulating to the public, sir. A series of documents about you, my Führer." the voice said gravely over the telephone. \n\n"What do they say, Gruppenführer?" Speer said, being met with a few moments of silence. "Gruppenführer, what the hell did they say?" the Führer said, in a mix of terror and great, seething anger. \n\n"Sir, they. They discuss information regarding your participation in the extended extermination of non-Aryans over the course of the Second World War and the years following." The military leader said, sending the painful shiver of horror straight into the void that made up the Führer's soul. "Students are responding in organization over the issue, asking you directly for answers, my Führer." \n\nThe realization of the painful setback of progress for the Reich shook Speer. No longer could he work towards securing his position of leadership in the Reich riding upon the pure faith of the reformists without answering towards the untold truths which lie at his feet. What has begun must be dealt with as always, however."
 BRG_adler.3.a:0 "I will handle it personally, Gruppenführer."

 BRG_adler.4.t:0 "A Devoted Soul"
 BRG_adler.4.d:0 ""So, Herr Flick, you have provided that, under the direct submittance of an additional seven and a half million Reichsmarks, that you shall be within immediate compliance towards general coordinated statements forwarded by our office, am I correct?" the icy, rasped voice of the Reichsführer-SS echoed out over the telephone towards the Businessman of the Reich. \n\n"National Socialism brought greatness to the Reich, it made the Reich whole. I am more than willing to do what I can as a true patriot to the German country and her people and stave off Speer's corruption; however, I simply have a few questions. Firstly, what will I be doing in accordance with our agreement, what do I have to do to ensure we do right by the Reich?" Flick said, meeting silence on the other end of the line. "And what about anonymity? My name is going to be scratched off of any documents regarding our deals and whatnot, correct?" Flick asked again. Meanwhile, the phone line continue to meet his expectations with a droning monotone. \n\n"You will find out soon, Herr Flick, but do not worry: no one shall know of our deals, and the millions you have earned from them." the Reichsführer-SS stated, as the phone line hung up. Six hundred miles apart from one another, both men took steps back from their chair, and readied themselves for the coming future."
 BRG_adler.4.a:0 "His patriotism shall be our gain."

 BRG_adler.5.t:0 "Bloody Ferdinand's Escape"
 BRG_adler.5.d:0 ""That's fucking bullshit, Kessler, there's no way in Hell that He could have gotten out of that compound that quickly, we had our men on every door into the goddamn place!" Wedekind said, crashing his cigar to the ashtray in anger. "The Führer is asking for our goddamn department to handle this, and we can't even find this shithead!" he said, filling the office with anger. \n\n"When did the unites at the East entrance last report?" Kessler said, as he continued to stare straight at the map below him on the table. \n\n"What the fuck are you talking about, Kessler? Twenty-Six hours ago, right after they went on patrol when they lost this monster, remember the damn report?" Wedekind said. \n\n"That's what I mean. Get a report from them, now. Find where they are, who they're with, their names, everything." Kessler said, as Wedekind confusingly went off to fulfill the task at hand. An hour later, the creaky door opened back into the investigation room as Wedekind made his way back into the room, report in hand and sunken eyes to match. "What's it say?" Kessler said. \n\n"Killed. Slaves got them, every last one of them, beat them to death with a few stab wounds in each." Wedekind responded. \n\nThe two men sat in a cold, silent anguish over the thoughts of what happened. That was before Kessler shot out his chair and grabbed Wedekind. "Wedekind, you listen here and you listen close. Look at that map and tell me, where in the Hell did slaves come out of nowhere when their nearest compound is dozens of miles away?" Kessler said, filling Wedekind with a great fear of the unknown."
 BRG_adler.5.a:0 "I-I don't know."

 BRG_adler.8.t:0 "The Pilot's Flight"
 BRG_adler.8.d:0 "The Reichsführer-SS sat patiently, quietly, and coldly, dancing his fingers upon the table as he waited for the incoming report his presence had been requested for. And, as  if on cue by the grand director of this wretched life, Ernst Kaltenbrunner came in, manilla folder in hand. "Glory to the Reichsführer-SS." stated the Nazi towering over the desk, offering his greatest Nazi salute. "Sir, these cold mornings have allowed for us a great victory in the fall of the succumbing Reich." he said, handing his superior the folder. \n\nAs the papers flipped by, the Reichsführer-SS continued to understand the meaning of these messages. That Fat Pig claiming to be the Führer as he waddled around, medallions in hand, is marching onward towards a new Grand War Strategy, dubbed "War Plan B," dedicated towards the annexation of further territories in the ravaging quest for new splendors for the Reich in their new failure. The Turkish, the Iberians, the Italians, the Russians, the Syrians, and the Africans would all come to meet a wall of the Reich's soldiers if all would go according to the plans of the decadent Hermann Göring. \n\n"Return to your duties, Herr Kaltenbrunner." the Reichsführer-SS said, as his underling marched off. Finally, it was time for the Ordensstaat to begin the immediate production of arms and equipment for these nations, and finally get involved with a little "foreign aid" in order to play catch up with the Reich's forward motion, and ensure their collapse comes yet."
 BRG_adler.8.a:0 "Göring will fail yet."

 BRG_adler.11.t:0 "Conquest on the Horizon"
 BRG_adler.11.d:0 "Ernst Kaltenbrunner once again found his way into the Reichsführer-SS's office as he twisted and turned down the halls of the High Command of the Ordensstaat. "Heil Reichsführer-SS." he said with a strong salute, yet exasperated and fearful breath. "Our agents have discovered immediately pertinent intelligence regarding the Führer's plan with the Ordensstaat, sir." He said, shifting the thick manilla folder towards the Reichsführer-SS's face. \n\n"I shall handle this personally, Herr Kaltenbrunner. You are dismissed, for now." the Reichsführer-SS said, as Kaltenbrunner shut the iron door behind him. Opening the document in front of him, the Reichsführer-SS's eyes' meeting of the words "Fall Schwarz" brought a great discovery to his mind... \n\nThe greatest key to the Plan he has ever found. \n\nThus, the Reichsführer-SS prepared. Yes, it was true that this a great discovery for the benefit of the future; however, how could he hope to achieve success if the plans were not in place? Allowing the Reich to run over and invade the Ordensstaat was an obvious impossibility if he sought to enact the Plan. Thus, he would have to prepare the great and mighty Aryans of the Ordensstaat to pledge every single man, every single resource, and every single bullet, towards waging a great war with the Rech. This would be their fate. This was destiny."
 BRG_adler.11.a:0 "Ragnarök awaits."

 BRG_adler.13.t:0 "Keep your Enemies Closer"
 BRG_adler.13.d:0 ""And that's how you managed to keep those Russian regiments on the run at Suslov? Tell me, tell me, what happened after the battle, Gruppenführer?" the amicable Walther Hewel stated, laughing as he ate. \n\n"Well, that's where I earned this." the SS-Gruppenführer stated as he pointed in the large scar across his left cheek. "The Russians had just enough explosives planted in their retreat to make it work, and took out a swathe of my man, and left me blind in my left eye for quite some time. But the Aryan does not give in, Mr. Hewel, he does not give up." The SS-Gruppenführer stated, causing the Foreign Minister of the Bormann administration to roar with laughter and giddiness towards the tale of war and bloodshed. "You are one mighty creature, Gruppenführer, a Lion in the company of Mice! Please, here is my personal office's telephone number, do be sure to call and we can talk anytime, they give me whatever I want up there, and you can get well paid in turn!" said Hewel, as he got up from the leather chair and walked away to grab more food, as the SS-Gruppenführer called \n\n"Sir, I would request one favor of you." he said to the listening Walther Hewel. "Stay evermore devoted to the glorious Führer Bormann, a true patriot." Hewel offered a smile and nod as he walked off. The SS-Gruppenführer, however, could not understand the nature of the operation. Why would the Reichsführer-SS desire to support the foundations of these idiots? Hewel could hardly keep himself contained and became a walking embarrassment over a small story of War in the West, how could we support these degenerates? The Reichsführer-SS must have a plan, and faith will be required if he sought the will to maintain this position and earn the Ordensstaat an inside to this entire spider web in the Reich."
 BRG_adler.13.a:0 "Degenerates, all of them."

 BRG_adler.14.t:0 "Strange Waters"
 BRG_adler.14.d:0 "The Führer, Martin Bormann, worked diligently upon his desk in his office in Germania. Everyday, incoming military, political, and economic reports gave new and rising situations regarding the Reich and her troubles, whilst the Führer himself offered estimations and calculations about how to conceptualize fixes for all these messes. One such mess required not fixing, yet still occupied Bormann's mind for quite some time: what was going on to cause the recent outspoken support from so much of the Administration, especially in a perilous time like this? \n\n"My Führer! Just the man I wanted to see!" said the Foreign Minister, Walther Hewel, as he crashed through the office. "I just had the most wonderful conversation at the Party Rally yesterday, sir, and I was reminded of just what I needed to do!" the Minister said, loudly for this time in the morning. \n\n"Ah, really? And what is it that you must do at a time like this, Hewel?" Bormann asked with a degree of annoyance and scorn as he lit a cigarette. \n\n"Well, sir, that's just it: it's you! The mighty Führer, Martin Bormann, who saved the Reich from collapse and preserved the legacy of the mighty Adolf Hitler! You have made our lives and prosperity possible, and no one seems to be cheery enough to say that anymore, sir! Thank you, and, remember, my office is always free to offer you what I can provide!" Hewel said, as he pat Bormann on the back and left. \n\nAnd there it was again. Another leader in the administration, overjoyed at everything Bormann was doing. This couldn't be right: the Reich was still facing issues, and as much as Hewel may be a fool, he wasn't just so easily able to overlook that. What was going on with the administration to flood these compliments? Then again, perhaps, the Führer thought to himself, maybe it was just time to offer himself some more credit for once."
 BRG_adler.14.a:0 "To worry or not?"

 BRG_adler.15.t:0 "A Phantom of Sorrows and Wealth"
 BRG_adler.15.d:0 "The brick and mortar walls of this ancient fortress filled the Businessman with fears of the children's stories of phantoms of Germany's past. However, he knew a great deal more about the terror able to be enacted by the phantoms he was surrounded with, whether it be the soul-draining nature of Speer's corruption, or the paralyzing fear of the men he worked with now. Thus came the terror as the Businessman turned and saw the the Scarred Giant of the Schutzstaffel enter the office. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." spoke the menacing voice that flowed through the Giant. \n\n"Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner, it is an honor." stated Flick, with a slight hint of mistruth as his terror ensured the tension of the meeting. \n\n"Sit down, Herr Flick. We have much to discuss." said Kaltenbrunner, as he came around to sit beside the Businessman. "Herr Flick, it has come under the understanding of your devotion to the cause of National Socialism, and your willingness to support the cause through the tragedies of the modern day which harm it so greatly. Thus, in accordance with your transactionary deals, your immediate orders are to cede as great a percentile of operations for your industries towards Führer Bormann's regime immediately." Kaltenbrunner said. \n\n"This is an outrage, those are my profits, my hard earned business success! How could we support that fool in times like these, this is treachery, this is an insult!" shouted Flick. \n\n"Herr Flick, you will understand the orders you have been provided and see they come into fruition or else face the bylaws of our contract." stated Kaltenbrunner as the two SS guards in the back took a step forward. As Flick sat back down, he could not help but cede his own will to the Scarred Giant across from him."
 BRG_adler.15.a:0 "It must be done."

 BRG_adler.16.t:0 "Reports, Redactions, and Removals"
 BRG_adler.16.d:0 "The pleasing mild successes accomplished by the Führer and his administration, managing to keep a smile plastered onto the people's faces had been assailed by a new confusing issue. The Führer continued to look onward, enjoying his organization and structure as a Master of the Bureaucrats, and, yet, something was wrong. Very wrong. As Bormann searched and scurried through his office, running his hand over every drawer and cubby, something was gone. \n\nMissing. \n\nSeveral things were. Yet, also, things that weren't here at the last point the Führer had come into his office had made their way onto his shelves and cases, when his secretary hadn't requested file transfers or anything of the sort! The matter brought sweat to the already-hardworked Führer's forehead, as the panic and confusion and paranoia of dissent and trickery plagued his mind. No, this couldn't have been, this was a simple trick, a mistake in the wake of the Führer's great work across the Reich taking up so much of his own time. However, in that slight chance, what if it truly is someone else instead? The Führer knew not, as he set his pen down and grasped his face, trying to ease his tensions."
 BRG_adler.16.a:0 "Get a hold of yourself."

These manifest in holes in the integrity of the corporatist hierarchy, corrupt fascists willing to tear themselves open for counterfeit lire.

To do this, we will fund paramilitaries and terrorists to wreak havoc for our machinations. Palestinian liberation parties will inspire intercommunal violence, Jewish ultranationalists will massacre villages, and the incompotent adminstrators will utterly fail to resolve the crumbling wall that seperates the northern and southern corridors of Lebanon.

 BRG_Keep_Them_Divided_desc:0 "공산주의는 현존하는 모든 이념중에서 가장 혐오스러운 이념이 아닐 수 없습니다. 그것은 정신적인 발암물질이며 만약 배설되지 않는다면 확산되고 또 확산되어 모든 인종의 생각을 오염시킬 전염병으로 발전할 겁니다. 다행히도 신의 섭리가 아리아 민족에게 이 불치병을 이길 낼 보호를 제공했습니다. 국가사회주의. 예. 과거 순수했던 라이히가 전 정권을 멸망시켰던 것처럼 우리가 서러시아 혁명전선을 파괴할 수 있게 해주는 것은 우리의 이념적 순결입니다.\n\n그들의 이념적 타락 다음으로 서러시아 혁명 전선의 가장 큰 약점은 끈질긴 파벌주의입니다. 주코프, 투하쳅스키, 알투닌은 세 가지 다른 종류의 공산주의 사상을 쫓고 있으며 그것이 경쟁으로 들어서는 순간, 이 국가의 모든 것을 망쳐버릴 수 있습니다. 이것은 우리가 이용할수 있는 가장 큰 약점이며 앞으로도 그렇게 될 것입니다. 우리는 그 볼셰비즘의 지도자들이 협력하지 못하도록 권력 기반을 분산시키며 내부 분쟁에 집중하게끔 상호증오의 불길을 부채질할 것입니다."
 BRG_Northern_Light_Show_desc:0 "코미 공화국은 2차대전에서 잘못된 교훈을 얻었습니다. 유럽인들은 국가사회주의의 우월성을 인정하여 서부의 진보주의자들과 동부 볼셰비키들에 대한 라이히의 승리를 대부분 수용했지만 코미의 사람들은 민주주의를 하겠다며 자신들의 공허한 공산주의 이념을 버리고 다른 시스템으로 바꾸기로 결정했었습니다. 덕분에 현재 코미는 그들이 채택한 체제의 단점만을 제대로 보여주는 고질적인 불안정과 수많은 불안에 시달리고있으며 민주주의를 유도하려는 그들의 썩어버린 노동은 우리에게 그들의 공화국에서 달콤한 결실을 수확할수 있게 해 줍니다. 뭐, 이젠 어느정도 안정화된 편이고 더이상 불협화음은 크게 남아있지 않은것 같지만 우리 요원들은 코미에 다시 대혼란을 촉발시킬 방법을 찾아낼 것입니다. 죽음이 코미의 대문을 걷어찬다면 문은 경첩이 떨어져나가 박살나겠지요."
 BRG_The_Tsar_desc:0 "서러시아는 기사단국에게 톡특한 퍼즐을 제공하고 있습니다. 우리의 목표는 두가지인데 서로 상쇄될 수 있는 것 같습니다. 우리는 러시아의 심장부의 혼돈을 모아 라이히에게 혼란을 불러일으킬수 있는 역할을 할 강력한 지역 강군을 만들어야 합니다. 이 꼭두각시는 다른 신생 러시아 국가들을 하나로 묶을 수 있을 만큼 충분히 강해야 하며, 또한 수 세대에 걸쳐 라이히의 노선을 슬라브 군단에게 저항하는데 힘을 쏟게 하여 약화시키고 결정적으로 경멸스러운 모스코비엔 국가판무관부를 박살내 종식시킬 수 있어야 합니다. 둘째로 이 신흥 강대국은 부르군트 SS기사단국에 대한 어떠한 정보나 저항을 가지고 있지 않아야 하며 슈츠슈타펠에게 위협이 될 만한 이념적 성향을 가지고 있지 않아야 합니다.\n\n운 좋게도 두가지 기준을 모두 총족하는 후보자를 발견했습니다. 자칭 차르인 퇴위 러시아 왕정의 후손인 뱟카 군벌이 우리의 공작에 유망한 후보로 선정되었습니다. 차르는 이전에 총통에게 부역하며 자신을 볼셰비즘에 대항할수 있는 아이콘으로 사용해달라 부탁한 적이 있습니다. 이것은 이전 볼셰비키의 독일 재침공 때 러시아인들에게 확실한 효과를 나타냈습니다. 뱟카는 요즘 조금씩 성장하며 도시를 발전시키기 시작했는데 이것은 우리 요원들을 심을 수 있는 절호의 기회입니다. 첫번째 단계는 우선 단순한 영향력 수집이 될 것이지만 그들 내부에 우리 쪽 사람들을 두는 것 자체가 향후 개입에 큰 도움이 될 겁니다."
 BRG_The_Brotherhood_desc:0 "서러시아의 혼란 속에서 일어난 세력은 지구를 오염시키고 있는 아리아 민족의 모든 이념적 원수의 축소판이라고 할 수 있습니다. 지금까지 쓰여졌던 모든 신조와 마셨던 모든 독들은 가장 극단적인 형태의 자유주의적 퇴폐의 변칙에서부터 엄격한 종교적 독단주의의 영혼을 부식시키는 변칙에 이르기까지 곰의 시체 안쪽에 새겨져 있는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 공산주의자들만 조국의 적이 아닙니다. 우리가 세상을 선하고 더 올바르게 만들려면 현상태의 관료들 역시 몰살시켜야 합니다. 가장 충격적인 것은 운터멘쉬들이 감히 자신들을 국가사회주의자라고 칭하고 있다는 겁니다...\n\n 아르한겔스크와 뱟카에 이르는 여러 두드러진 강국들과는 달리 이 러시아 약소국은 우리의 목표에 크게 가치가 없습니다. 아마 전쟁이 벌어진다면 이들은 그냥 주변 강국들이 쌓게 될 시체의 산 그 이상 의미를 가지진 못할 겁니다. 그들은 가장 굴욕적인 죽음을 맞이할 자격이 있습니다. 자신의 부하들에게 죽음을 당하는 것만큼 굴욕적인 죽음이 있을까요? 이 "아리아인 형제단"은 우리 요원들이 선동한 조직적인 집단 노예 반란에 휩싸여 감히 아리아인을 참칭한 것에 대한 대가를 받게 될 겁니다. 우리 SS요원들은 밤이 되면 형제단의 도시로 잠입해 파괴하고, 도망가기보다는 싸우기를 선호하는 자들을 무장시킬 겁니다. 다시는 러시아인들이 감히 '아리아인'을 칭하지 못하게 해야지요."
 BRG_The_Samaran_Question_desc:0 "블라소프는 과거 붉은 군대의 파르티잔으로서 공산주의를 위해 러시아 제국을 전복시키는 것으로 그의 커리어를 시작했습니다. 모스크바에서 국방군에게 패한 후 그는 반역자가 되어 라이히와 연합해 총통을 위해 싸우기로 결심한 러시아인들을 이끌었습니다. 처음부터 그의 조국에 대한 충성심은 의심스러웠습니다. 그는 러시아 동부의 볼셰비키들이 무너질때까지 묵묵히 그의 임무를 수행했고 그 이후 독일 장비로 무장한 러시아 군인들을 이끌어 하나의 군벌로 변모시켰습니다. 그는 다른 사람들과 같은 운명을 맞이할 자격이 있습니다.\n\n우리 정보에 의하면 블라소프 군의 반체제 인사인 오흐탄은 쿠데타를 일으킬 준비를 하고 있는것 같습니다. 사마라 내전이 벌어진다면 우리는 그를 아낌없이 도울 것입니다. 사마라의 사람들은 그의 세력이 의아할 정도로 갑자기 커지며 블라소프의 충성파 병력들이 사라지는 것을 알게 될 겁니다. 우리가 파악한 바 오흐탄은 우리의 선물을 의도에 대한 의심없이 받아들일 바보로 판단됩니다. 곧 블라소프 장군에게 배반으로 세력을 키운 모든 자들의 운명을 보여주도록 합시다."
 BRG_The_Freikorp_desc:0 "폭격으로 파괴된 도시가 가득하고 자그만한 주들로 붕괴된 서러시아의 황폐한 초원과 불타버린 숲은 아리아 민족의 불굴의 의지에 반하는 모든 것의 정당한 운명으로서 우뚝 서 있습니다. 선조들이 이전에 슬라브인들에게 야기시킨 재앙 때문에 발생한 혼란사태로 이제 우리 기사단국이 막대한 행운을 거머쥐게 되었습니다. 없는 거나 다름없는 현지 기반시설과 부패한 관료들의 비도덕이 초래한 질서의 부재는 새로운 보병 여단이나 무기를 그 출처에 대한 의심없이 우리가 원하는 곳으로 옮길 수 있게 만들어 주었습니다. 따라서 뱟카의 지방 당국은 그들의 '사랑하는' 차르에게 충성하고 군 복무 준비가 되어 있는 전문적으로 무장하고 훈련된 군인들을 발견하게 되어 매우 기뻐할 겁니다. 물론 우리의 독일 억양에 대해 좀 조치를 취해야 하겠지만 말이죠."
 BRG_Infiltrate_The_Okhrana_desc:0 "만약 뱟카의 차르에게 복무하고 있는 군인들 중 그나마 정예라고 불리는 자들이 있다면 그건 아마 오흐라나일 겁니다. 이 호위병들은 차르의 영토에 대한 내부 질서를 유지하는 책임을 맡고 있는데 이것은 우리의 입장에서 우리의 국가가 뱟카의 정치와 군사같은 모든 면에 영향을 미칠수 있는 최고의 방법임을 의미합니다. 지금 뱟카에 존재하는 우리의 요원들은 뱟카의 모든 군인중에 가장 뛰어나기 때문에 그들이 오흐라나에 임명되는 것이 그리 어렵지 않을 것입니다. 하지만 차르의 경호원들이 그들의 새 친구를 너무 의심한다면 우리 셔츠 주머니에 넣어준 중요한 물건 몇 개가 그걸 보증하기에 충분하고도 남을 것입니다. 고대 로마의 프라이토리아니들이 로마의 정치에 큰 영향을 미쳤듯이 우리의 통제 하에 있는 오흐라나 또한 러시아 차르주의자들의 정치에 중대한 영향을 미칠 수 있게 될 것입니다."
 BRG_Wo_alle_strasen_enden_desc:0 "뱟카의 차르에 대한 모든 준비가 끝났습니다. 우리는 그가 그의 국가를 확장하고 러시아 전쟁을 준비하는 동안 우리가 할 수 있는 모든 것을 다했습니다. 차르는 모르고 있지만 그는 우리의 도움 없이는 그렇게 유능한 채로 존재할 수 없었을 겁니다. 심지어 그의 안전을 책임지는 가장 가까운 사람들조차 우리 손 안에 있습니다. 우리의 모든 작품들은 뱟카가 서러시아의 운터멘쉬들을 없애기 위해, 그리고 우리 조국 옆에 존재하는 슈츠슈타펠의 적들을 무찌를수 있게 할 장기말일 뿐입니다. 차르는 우리의 의도에 따라 꼭두각시처럼 제국을 운영할 것이며 SS국가지도자 각하의 적들은 그들이 받아들여할 운명을 맞이할 것입니다. 이 러시아를 다시 제국으로 만드는데 수십만의 슬라브인들이 죽어야 한다면 그것도 좋은 일입니다. 어차피 세상은 그들이 많아지는것을 바라지 않으니까요."

 BRG_globalplan_puma_decisions_desc:0 "세계계획 퓨마 is the long-awaited strike against the pathetic Bourgeois-Jewish-Capitalist cowards within the United State, who have so long sought to inhibit the true capabilities of the Aryan race. By funneling supplies to the radical groups on the left and right alike, infiltrating all sectors of American society, and building a network of connections able to further the will of the Reichsfurher, we will at last bring the American "giant" to its knees. By the order of the Reichsfurher-SS, the exploitation and sabotage of the New World's vast array of resources is of highest priority. Success in this area will allow the Plan to advance to completion, ushering the final triumph of the Aryan, and a glorious new age worthy of his true capabilities."

 BRG_america_alight_desc:0 "Although the United States has persisted as the very antithesis to the vision encompassed by the Reichsführer-SS, a true enemy to the Aryan master race, it would be untruthful to say that there are not groups within the United States that come close to the visions of National Socialism. Such organizations, such as the widely-known "Ku Klux Klan," act as wild mongrels whereas the Burgundian stands as a strong wolf. However, these mongrels' direct stand against the "equality of races" forwarded by the American government, and, in turn, enemies of the democratic system, proving to be possible allies within the destabilization of the United States government. Thus, it is in our immediate interest within 세계계획 퓨마 to direct funding towards the support and expansion of such groups, as well as tying in various external agents to infiltrate the ranks and feed our influx of information from within the United States. Furthermore, we shall begin infiltrating the ranks of both the Republican-Democratic Party and National Progressive Party, in order to secure a grasp on the political sphere as a whole."

The Reichsführer-SS has carefully and masterfully constructed a plan to deny the chances of any further corruptions of the world, and tying a noose around the democratic influences the Americans have spread across the globe.

Decadence has perverted the vision for those within the United States who support such "racial equality" movements sponsoring the supports of African-blooded citizens within the United States; however, to our benefit, there remains those that stand nearly as outraged as the Ordensstaat in this gross crime against the more pure individuals, a problem for the government of the United States which can be capitalized on by our agents throughout the south. Thus, we shall begin drafting plans towards the fervent radicalization of these groups, and organize violent acts of unrest within these southern states. In the past, these violent organizations participated in mass acts of arson, terror, and hangings of blacks within the south; now, we shall relight the flames of fury for these groups in order to draw the attention of the President and his cabal away from the world stage."

But. where obstacles are conquered, opportunities arrive. Already, we have managed to infiltrate and expand the machinations of the Ku Klux Klan and other radical violent race groups to help destroy the stability of the south, but therein lies a new opportunity for profit, both strategically and economically. The enemies of the Ku Klux Klan and its sister organizations have grown restless and, provided the equipment and funding, could launch a radical new set of destruction across the South. Thus, despite the difficulties in stooping to such levels, we shall begin the exportation of mock American military equipment to the "Black Panthers" and other militant black groups, as this will boost our economic standings while providing a new bloodbath for the federal government to clean up."

Throughout a multitude of countries and continents, the power of the United States may not necessarily come from military strength or political influence, but rather the strength of the American dollar. However, whereas their "free capitalist systems" has allowed their corruption to seep across the already disgusting populaces across the globe, there remains a crucial weakness to be exploited. That being, banks and the men that own them enjoy a wide range of freedoms in business practices, and enjoy laxing federal regulations thanks to the laziness of its statesmen. However, where these policies may be violations of the austerity of National Socialism, there remains a profitable venture for the Ordensstaat. Swaying the likenesses of bankers towards farther and farther right-winged interests will allow investments from the Ordensstaat to flourish, bolstering our economy while eroding the power of the federal government of the United States from containing its own economy, eventually leading to economic turmoil and fallout for them while we sit on our earned riches."

Such Republican-Democrats refuse to make a stand, and seek to drag down the world into this lazy, cowardly, and disgusting way of life. We, as true inheritors of the powers of man, cannot allow these weaklings to further corrupt the world as they already have. With agents already present within and outside of the party, we shall wreak havoc on the political standings of the Republican-Democrat Party until they are unable to stand any longer as a viable political entity for the United States, and finally, Americans will be pushed towards taking the reins in conflicts against the Japanese and the world."

We must ensure the destruction of these weaknesses of the United States, along with the ruination of the Americans at a world stage; however, there are those within the United States, beyond just fanatics, who associate themselves with the Ordensstaat's value of national and racial control for the state. In this way, mainstream politics have navigated towards the Far Right branch of the National Progressive Party who, while still maintaining democractic notions, is an answer for potential national and military dominance. Even more than the Far Right, our established relations with Francis Parker Yockey's faction, a dedicated proponent of the similar beliefs of the Reich.

Here, they shall labor towards shifting the tone of these events towards the supporting of more right-winged viewpoints, allowing the arguments across the United States to grow both more radically and more in our favor.

Now, this "Bobby" Kennedy seeks to claim greatness for the United States through the disgusting rulings of a liberal agenda combined with a charismatic campaign across the country. We can not, no, we must not allow this filth to dare stand in the way of the Reichsführer-SS's ultimate vision. Our first step in destroying the might of this degenerate weakling will be to fund a direct divide between his base of support and the idol to odious corruption that is Washington D.C. and his revolting administration. Once the public plunges the daggers of betrayal into their President's back, we shall move on to fund a collapse of the National Progressive Party itself. Friends shall remember their enemies, as the radicals grow to tear themselves apart, ripping the stability of the country apart as they do so, and allowing the Ordensstaat to grow stronger and stronger."

Thus, we shall use our southern agents for a pushing back of Lyndon B. Johnson's supposed "reforms" and instead promote the potential of a locally-cultivated, racially-oriented broth of knowledge. The disgust of the United States may corrupt this creation beyond the Ordensstaat's standards; however, it shall be enough to destroy Johnson's credibility and spark further conflict between Washington D.C. and the very country it's meant to lead."

You must appeal to the people directly to bypass the alluring madness of the Red Hydra. The Glenn administration is speaking of reducing their nuclear arsenal, to save money for his Bukharinite social programs. Surely the people won't accept this insanity from the R-D's, even if they are degenerates. We must immediately redeploy our agents to manage propaganda campaigns denouncing this open invitation to Japanese invasion.

"Beware the Eternal Jew, trust no one who would consider any kind of socialism 'good,' and beware of the mounting Negro threat that we all face! Our blood, white blood!, was spilled for their freedom, and look how they thank us! Never forget!" A moment of silence, a quick thanks, and the meeting was over.\n\nEdward Dawson wasn't quite sure what to make of it all. Yeah, sure, the Jews were ruining the country, but his black coworkers in the FBI were not monsters like the Klan Master was making them out to be. Edward exhaled audibly as he walked from the small forest clearing to his truck. He pulled out a cigarette and lit it, then reached for his keys. A sudden gust of wind knocked the cigarette out of his mouth. "Fuck." he swore in the darkness. "Need another, friend?" a voice asked.\n\nEdward turned around, and before him stood a slender man, holding out a pack of smokes. "Thanks." Edward said. The man nodded, popped out his own lighter, and lit Edwards smoke.\n\n"That was... something." The man began. "You're Edward, right?"\n\n"Yeah..." Edward replied. He took a step back, alarm bells ringing in his head. How the hell did he know his name? "Who are you?"\n\n"Oh, me?" The man laughed. "Derik. We went to middle school together." Edward nodded. "Nice talking to you, Derik." He jumped into his pickup and turned the ignition. Nothing. Fuck.\n\nHe tried to start the engine three more times before giving up. God damnit. The mortgage was due, no food in the house, and now the truck was dead. "Fuck!" He jumped out and kicked the truck. The other man; Derik, watched silently. Then, "Rough night?"\n\nEdward sighed. "Long month. God dammit man, when it rains, it pours." Derik nodded his head in understanding. "Need a ride? I'm going to the bar, but I'm more than happy to drop you off, or you can even come along if you want. You sure seem like you could use a beer. First one will even be on me." Derik winked."

It was easy to preach that Jews and blacks were bad, but why? And every question that Dawson thought up, thought that would trip up the self-assured supremest was always met by a reasonable, logical answer.\n\n"... and so, that is the White Man's burden. We spread across these great plains, and brought civilization and greatness from sea to shining sea." His face glowed as laughter filled the bar. Although both weren't official Klansmen, any white man who knew of their struggle was welcome in the White Knight's barroom. "But those goddamn liberals would see all of our work thrown away." His face dropped. He sipped his beer, then leaned back into his chair.\n\n"But surely, your work with the Yockies, organizing and all that... uh, stuff. It's making a difference!" Edward exclaimed. Derik sighed.\n\n"It's not enough my friend. It's never enough. The whole country is against us. The Jews have almost won, its nearly too late already." He sipped his beer. "The Federal Government puts us down, community leaders hate our message, hell, even you work against us." Derik pointed at Dawson. "The FBI loves to terrorize and spy on us. What can we do?" Dawson steeled himself. He had decided days ago that he would help in any way he could. He had to do something, ANYTHING, to help save his country. And what better way to do that than from the inside?"

He thought he'd heard the end of the Kennedy's for good when his brain splattered all over that limo. As per usual, he was wrong.\n\nEdward rubbed his eyes.

Nevertheless, Edward got to work, raising a picture of J. Edgar Hoover up to his face. It was modified, of course, to look like Hoover was having an intimate moment with his assistant director, Clyde Tolson. Up close, Edward noticed the blemishes of Tolson's cheeks, the wrinkled, washed out hands of Hoover, and some minor distortions and artifacts from the manipulation process. He cursed under his breath; he followed the instructions exactly!\n\nFrustrated, Edward picked up his house phone and pulled out a piece of paper with his contact's number written on it; He dialed the number breathing heavily.\n\n"Editing photos isn't exactly the hardest thing, Ed.

Andre Palson was one of those volunteers.\n\nAs he stepped inside and opened the door to the bright, messy mailroom, he noticed the eternal stack of white and occasionally brown sheets of paper hastily put in the paper holder on his desk. Andre grabbed a stapled, crumpled, and damp-smelling letter. The letter was a great example of the most common piece of writing sent to RFK: A man from Georgia explains in a five page long essay that the "...institution of segregation will remain eternal in the American Deep South." The audacity and stunning conviction of that made Andre think that no possible letter could be worth sending to the President. Moments after picking up another letter, he changed his mind. A letter from a young girl attending Harvard, RFK's alamater, expressing her positive opinions on his policies regarding civil rights.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the President opened up the new re-packaged letter, to read about a young girl's message to the President.

Its structure is ingeniously designed to root out subversives: a potential recruit is identified and approached by a Gestapo agent posing as a Brotherhood recruiter. They are brought to several meetings, and asked to do minor tasks to prove their loyalty: for example, stealing a crate of rifles from an (already-alterted) garrison. With their loyalty proven, they are asked to bring one or two trusted accomplices with them to the next meeting. There, they are all arrested and processed by the Gestapo.\n\nThe most challenging part of this plan will be building the reputation of this false organization. Underplay it in the media, and people will not hear of it; overplay it, and people will doubt the Ordensstaat's power. It will take careful planning by Office VII's propaganda wing in order to create the illusion that the group is expanding organically while still maintaining that the RHSA is adequate in fighting the threat, but we are confident that they can pull it off."

Although the numbers will eventually decline when would-be resistance members start to wise up and no longer fall for it, we hope to round up at least a couple thousand by the time the program is completed.

American cigarettes, Italian wines, and Brazilian bananas seem to be their most popular brands. A few summary public executions of smugglers and purchasers, combined with a more aggressive beach-combing operation along the shoreline to find light boats with contraband, should be enough to deal with the problem in the meantime.\n\nAs for the Dutch, it seems that most of their involvement is radical pan-nationalists seeking to incite dissent among the Flemish communities of the Ordensstaat.

The road was flanked by trenches and pillboxes, with miniature machine guns poking out of them. There were caches of concrete barriers, sandbags, caltrops, dragon's teeth, and even a couple artillery pieces—enough to stop anything up to and including a panzer.

Families were permitted to come along, though by no means could they be prioritized if it meant missing the deadline. Their master called, and they were needed.\n\nSoon, the men began arriving. The more high-status ones managed to bluff their way in or secure an official authorization. Others deserted their posts or smuggled themselves in. One particularly resourceful Obersturmführer stationed in Cornwall stole a local's sailboat and went right across the Channel under the cover of night, sailing into Kalen the next morning. Some have had to leave their families behind, of course, but we all must make sacrifices for the Vaterland.\n\nA reason for the men's recall has not been issued, though rumors swirl among the rank-and-file about the Reichsführer-SS's motivations. The most popular one, spoken only in hushed tones when officers are out of the room, is that war is imminent in the Reich. The Führer's failing health is an open secret, but few want to admit how bad things can potentially get. The Reichsführer-SS, however, seems to anticipate the worst case scenario.

But who was he spying on? The group of SS officers in the local garrison? The civil servants who streamed in after work? The French laborers who drank to forget their pain? The bartender himself? He didn't want to take any chances, so he made sure to make a show of dusting off and straightening the portraits of the Führer and Reichsführer-SS suspended above the door that day.\n\nThe next day, the new patron didn't show up, and the bartender breathed a silent sigh of relief. He also noticed that one of the garrison officers was absent, and the rest of his group was unusually sullen. He knew what had happened, everyone did.

However, this does not mean that we can afford to be lax.

His rivals, meanwhile, have extensive connections and support bases that have firmly entrenched themselves in German society. This is something that no amount of guns, military attaches, or intelligence dossiers can replicate.\n\nBut while it takes years of diplomacy to build up loyal allies for oneself, it takes far less time and effort to tear down another's cronies. Brake line failures, burglaries gone wrong, tragic suicides, accidental overdoses, sodomy convictions, embezzlement charges, evidence of a grandmother's torrid affair with a Jewish manservant... there are simply so many ways that life can suddenly take a turn for the worse."

Now it is just looking like a bit more of an uphill battle than before. Nothing beyond the Waffen-SS's capabilities.\n\nThis realization will allow us to better plan how to proceed going forward. While the other contenders for the Führership continue to jockey for political favors and brown-nose half the Reichstag, we will focus on preparing for war.

Not because it was a good place to be; no, it was hell. But it was a hell that they had a chance of escaping. They could flee to Denmark, and then Sweden. Or Switzerland. Or Italy. Anywhere, as long as it wasn't Burgundy. They knew the chances were slim, but at least it was a chance.\n\nThey came to a halt at the foot of the hills, where a large chicken wire fence blocked the way. Guillaume didn't miss a beat, and he reached into his bag and pulled out a rusty old pair of wire cutters. He started cutting through the fence... and immediately fell to the ground convulsing. Marie screamed and rushed down to help, dragging him away from the fence. She cradled him in her arms until he began to stir, slowly helping him to his feet.

He allowed himself a brief, fond remembrance of the days he and Heydrich had stood shoulder to shoulder against the plots of Göring, glory days long gone, but then snapped his attention back to the presentation.

As my colleague mentioned earlier, while creating atomic-proof facilities for an estimated four hundred thousand people is a challenge, it is within the parameters faced by Organisation Todt during the War, and with enough funding doable within a four to six year period. Now, the rail network for Project Lifthrasir is a whole other matter. Even with the hundred and sixty thousand subjects that are in the process of being resettled in the Alpine region, that leaves us two hundred and forty thousand subjects, eighty thousand of whom are considered critical, primarily located in the Paris, Aurelstadt and Elsass regions. My proposal is as follows. Three four-lane subterranean rail lines encased in reinforced concrete at a depth of 11 meters. Since we will only have time for a single departure in the estimated 21 minutes before impact in a surprise attack scenario, I propose using the extant Paris Metro as a temporary shelter for non-critical personnel...""

The calls have made clear that Charlemagne and its divisional head, Brigadeführer de la Mazière will take it as a direct insult if they are not trusted with the handling of nuclear materials. While obviously it would be a minimal risk for us to entrust Charlemagne with this, given their great loyalty to our cause, giving concessions to them risks inflaming tensions with Langemarck. Still, given Charlemagne's considerable position of power within the SS, and to ensure the increasingly paranoid de la Maziére that we have no desire to challenge his position of authority, it seems clear we must do our best to appease them.

A creeping dread filled the crowd as the Reichsführer, instead of congratulating them, had merely signalled to some soldiers for a table, chair and pencil to be brought him. For the past quarter hour, he had been sitting quietly, flipping through pages, letting his fingers slide across photos of the mushroom cloud and damage to the test site, and chewing on his pencil, occasionally tapping it on a photo or underlining a word or phrase in the text.\n\nAfter another half hour of nervous staring from the assembled scientists, Himmler finished the last page and closed the folder, handing it and the pencil to a soldier who stepped up. Getting up to leave, the Reichsführer turned to the lead scientist. Himmler's face seemed disaffected, nearly bored, but those standing closest could see an ember of triumph in his eyes behind the reading glasses he had put on.\n\n"Good. Proceed with Phase Two."\n\n"Jawohl mein Reichsführer! Heil Himmler!"\n\nThe Reichsführer paid no heed to the lead researcher's statement, and showed no sign of hearing the collective "HEIL HIMMLER!" of the assembled crowd which followed their leader's salute.

 BRG_kondor.1.desc:0 "Iberia is a bastard state.  This is certainly true of its most recent incarnation, as a patchwork of two governments united only by the desire to hold off the influence of the Reich.  But it has been this way for a very long time.  The peninsula has never known Aryan rule, having been settled by lesser peoples of southern Europe.  Greeks, Phoenicians, Lusitanians, and more.  All of these peoples became a stew of new languages and nations, from the savage Moors to the bizarre Basques.  And this is to say nothing of their centuries of vile Jewish influence.  Altogether, Iberia is a patchwork of inferior peoples that should never have become one unified power.  But this is also an opportunity for us.  Many of these peoples-Basque, Catalan, Asturian, Galician-seek independence from the central government.  Moreover, the Iberian state occupies a unique position on the world stage.  Its economy has been wrecked by the Gibraltar Dam, but it also finds itself in control of the thing.  It has a sizable overseas colonial empire.  In short, there is a great deal of room to further our ambitions through the strange, impure amalgamation that is the Iberian Union."

Its location at the gate to the Mediterranean and the European continent makes the prize of a friendly Iberian polity too valuable for the great powers to resist interfering in the conflict, and tensions are sure to escalate across the globe as they find themselves backing rival factions.\n\nThere is much work to be done. Plans must be adapted, and new ones made. Assets must be activated and put to work. These first, chaotic months will define a conflict that might last years, and these crucial moments will contain the best chances to make the wars serve our purposes.

The Portuguese loathe the Spanish, and the Castillian Spanish loathe the Portuguese almost as much as they loathe the various minorities in their nation, who loathe them back. It seems the only ones the whole peninsula can agree to loathe are the natives in their colonies and the concept of competent government. Without the strong state seen in our Ordensstaat, Iberia fumbles in the dark, always at the brink of immeasurable violence.\n\nLike a house of cards, all we need is one little push on the right card, and it will all come crumbling down.

It is hard to stop them from being distracted by petty internal squabbles, and many of the more left wing movements begin growing increasingly skeptical to our arms shipments as they start to suspect their origins. Not every faction can be as willingly subverted as our friends the Asturians, but that can easily be remedied using our strategically placed insiders. False information about another political faction making it seem the weapons come from us here, a bit of propaganda there, and maybe some slight application of bribery, blackmail and political smearing where necessary. \n\nIf we can continue to successfully wrangle the separatists using our insiders, it may be time to begin considering withdrawing some of our German agents from Iberia, to lessen the risk of detection."

This stranglehold over one its participants opens up many avenues towards influencing the conflict.\n\nThe connection is proving increasingly controversial, however, within our own ranks. The loyal soldiers of the SS didn't sign up to consort with socialists, and many of our favored sons  object to the operation on principle.

While he may be an economist by trade, Salazar is an imperialist conservative at heart.  He dabbles in strange ideas, like Portuguese pluricontinentalism, that would see the Union retain and expand its influence in Africa, and perhaps even beyond.  With Salazar holding the reins of power, Iberia would stagnate, more obsessed with retaining old glories than building a state for the modern world.  More importantly, it would be a state that crosses lines in order to achieve dominance over new parts of the globe.  In Algeria, especially, Salazar's Iberia would push its luck, perhaps too far.

The Ordensstaat will supply these groups with all the guns they could ever need.  In return, the profits from this arms smuggling will bring liquid capital back to the Ordensstaat.

One candidate looks particularly promising, and has even rendered aid upon our Führer once before: the warlord of Vyatka, a man who would style himself an emperor, and would surely not rebuff our assistance in reclaiming his birthright.

War material is hard to come by in West Russia, and this attack will significantly hamper both our weapons stockpiles and our logistical capabilities going into the near future. Our men will have to be wary of future such incursions, in case this is a prelude to a more serious invasion—it would also be wise to reprise against whichever of our neighbours we think is responsible."

 BRG.5002.t:0 "Veterans Flock to the Tsar"
 BRG.5002.d:0 "Skilled mercenaries and professional soldiers have arrived in Vyatka en masse, bringing along their own weapons and equipment and offering to pledge themselves to us in exchange for room and board. Some of these warriors are exceptionally effective, and many claim to have travelled from the farthest ends of the country to arrive here and pledge their loyalty to the rightful Tsar. The famines and unrest afflicting the rest of Russia must be severe for the powers that be in such lands to be turning away strong fighting men such as these. We shall take this boon as a sign of God's benevolence for our loyalty to his entrusted regent on Earth, the Tsar, and send these men to work immediately!"
 BRG.5002.a:0 "A great boon."

 BRG.5003.t:0 "Simeon's Smile"
 BRG.5003.d:0 "Everyone here knew him as 'Simeon'. He tried not to give out a surname, but if anyone persisted, he would tell them it was Verenich. Neither name meant anything to him. Someone back in Paris had picked them for him, just like they had picked his background. He was a river merchant, from a farm village outside Murygino. He had three children: two daughters living with his wife, and a son that died in the war. Which war he died in, and fighting which enemy, depended on who he was speaking to at the time. His identity was eminently plausible, both common and dreary enough to not inspire much questioning. He'd never gotten accustomed to living as 'Simeon', though. Russia was too hostile and alien for him to ever feel at ease here. He mostly stayed by himself ever since arriving, and every time he had to talk to someone—like today—all he had on his mind was the need not to give himself away.\n\nConstruction was underway in Vyatka. An impressive looking port facility was being built along the river, at the behest of the local Tsar. Rumour abound of a plan by the Tsar to earn himself a war chest manufacturing vodka, and it was just that sort of rumour that 'Simeon' was eager to exploit. A medium sized bribe was enough for him to be sat in an office opposite the Crown Representative to the port, discussing a trade agreement Simeon was sure would be too enticing for the bureaucrat to resist. His ships would sail into Vyatka to unload potatoes collected from farm towns connected to the river, and on their way out of the city again, those same crates would be filled with bottles of the Tsar's vodka. Of course, the potato crates would hide secret compartments hiding bullets and disassembled rifles, and many of Simeon's crew were secretly more SS agents. The port bureaucrat didn't need to know that, though. All he needed to see was a friendly smile from a local merchant, eager to make a profit for himself and his Tsar."

 BRG.5004.t:0 "Eagles Flock to the 'Tsar'"
 BRG.5004.d:0 "A troupe of skilled Ordensstaat soldiers arrived in Vyatka en masse, equipped with locally acquired Russian weaponry and passable accents. They lied through their teeth to the authorities, insisting to be imperial loyalists coming to Vyatka to pledge their service to the Tsar. Every one of them felt sick having to impersonate a Slav, and a few barely even tried, staring at onlookers with a hostile glare that only made the whole group look even more intimidating. They each had their own tale to spin about why and how they arrived here, some talking of famine and others explaining away their peculiar manner of speaking with stories about their far away origins. Maybe some of the locals raised an eyebrow or two, but the Tsar's officials were all too eager to unwittingly accept the undercover SS veterans into their ranks, blue eyes or not."

 BRG.5005.t:0 "Stoking Fires in a Tinderhouse"
 BRG.5005.d:0 "In the Russian warlord state of Komi, where once there stood just another derelict old building reminding Russians of the old days, there was now a fully functioning propaganda factory, helping to usher Russia into a new age. A handful of SS agents, stocked with exotic supplies hard to find in the wastes of Russia (such as paper and paint), had been enough to repair and renovate the building into what would pass in Russia for an office complex. From there, they produced an extremely efficient printing and inking complex, producing hundreds of propaganda posters a day advertising the campaigns of extremist political parties in the so-called 'Komi Republic'. Decrying the dangers of imminent onslaught from the likes of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the posters depict a Komi Republic on the precipice of destruction, the Red Army about to arrive and crush all of the republic's citizens beneath its boot. Those same citizens have seemed receptive to the efforts of our agents thus far; there has been a noticeable uptick in support for nationalist and fascist parties in this most fragile of republics. It likely won't be long now before Komi's little experiment with democracy comes crashing to an abrupt end."
 BRG.5005.a:0 "It is time to light a spark."

 BRG.5007.t:0 "Radical Right on the Rise"
 BRG.5007.d:0 "Across the republic, posters and protestors are beginning to plaster the streets of city centres, decrying an impending onslaught from the West Russian Revolutionary Front. An extremely vocal far-right minority has made its presence known, very loudly and very suddenly, and their agitation has been turning more and more of Komi's citizens towards the farthest rightist parties. Decrying each of our neighbours in West Russia, the agitators and their propaganda insist that an invasion from one or another rival state is on its way, and that our republic needs radical, immediate change to its military and domestic policies if we are to survive it—including the end of our democratic traditions. Where exactly the material for these posters came from, or who has been covering our streets with them, remains a mystery, but authorities have been monitoring the usual suspects. We can only hope that this impromptu rightist revolt peters out before it becomes too destabilizing."

 BRG.5008.d:0 "The men on the streets controlling Perm and the other major cities of the Aryan Brotherhood have begun to take precipitous losses, with no clear evidence of outside attack. Every night, weapons are stolen and captives are freed, and each day another revolt from the subdued denizens of the Brotherhood needs to be put down. These constant thefts and minor rebellions are peppered with more infrequent major acts of sabotage. Explosives going off in ammunition depots, or entire platoons deserting their posts, have become far too common for the manpower and equipment reserves of the Brotherhood to keep up. Something will have to change, and soon, or the Brotherhood may be at risk of collapse."

 BRG.5009.t:0 "Domestic Industry Crippled by Revolt"
 BRG.5009.d:0 "The constant internal sabotage befalling our ranks has intensified to a critical point. Our production of new war material has become to drag behind how quickly it is stolen or destroyed in the field, and prospective new recruits aren't joining our forces as fast as dejected older veterans are leaving. The industrial capacity of the Brotherhood—so dependent on the productive capacity of slave-workers—has been forced to a standstill by endless revolts, as agitators hiding amongst us persistently stir up tensions and arm the workers against our good Aryan soldiers. Our industry and military alike are being pushed to their very limits, and there doesn't seem to be any easy way to stop the bleeding..."
 BRG.5009.a:0 "Dire straits for the Aryan race."

 BRG.5010.t:0 "Preparing Oktan"
 BRG.5010.d:0 "The Russian General Vlasov has had a particularly pitiable existence. Beginning with his defeat against and subsequent defection to the war machine of the Reich, he has had little success in realizing his grandiose plans to reunite Russia and earn for himself a title in Russian history books greater than that of 'traitor'. A traitor, though, is all that he deserves to be remembered for, a traitor—and a Slav besides—can never be considered truly loyal to the Aryan race. Thus, the agents of the Ordensstaat emplaced in Vlasov's Samaran rump-state will see to it that he never amounts to anything else but his great betrayal.\n\nOne of Vlasov's underlings, Oktan, has wavered in his loyalties to the traitor warlord ever since the end of the West Russian War. Oktan rightfully views Vlasov as a submissive underling to the Reich, a man who betrayed his own people to serve a foreign power, and is justly hated for it by all men from Samara to Arkhangelsk. Oktan has his own ambitions, and leads a troupe of Vlasov's high ranking subordinates who wish to see the traitor warlord replaced. They have their own silly beliefs about what will happen afterwards, imagining that Oktan can lead Russia to find greatness, but their sad delusions are not of any concern to us. All that matters to the Reichsführer-SS is seeing Vlasov's head on a pike, and Oktan can deliver that. Our agents will tell those of Vlasov's generals who have not yet pledged themselves to Oktan to join with him, extolling his virtues as the only commander brave, ambitious and strong enough to save Russia. All lies, of course."
 BRG.5010.a:0 "Russia is beyond saving."

 BRG.5011.t:0 "Greasing the Bear"
 BRG.5011.d:0 "The time has come for our final preparations in West Russia. The great showdown between communist and anti-communist forces in the region is about to kick off, and it is clear which side's victory would most benefit the designs of the Reichsführer-SS. Our agents adjunct to Russia have been acting in the shadows for months and years, subtly turning the nationalist Russian state into something more than just another warlord: something that can fight against the festering corpse of the Soviet Union in Arkhangelsk, and win. Our primary contact in Vyatka, the river merchant responsible for positioning so many of our men in the Okhrana, will receive word of a large new shipment coming in soon. A cache of upgraded weapons is not all that awaits him; we will also be transferring all of our field agents in Russia to Vyatka, to directly assist in the impending war, personally. The collared bear will maul the communist menace to death for us, and feast on its corpse to become a power to rival the corruption that pollutes the Reich. Not only will Russia be purged of Judeo-Bolshevik influences, but it will also stand strong enough to take its place in our great plans for the future. The SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is about to witness a great personal victory, and shall not have had to move much more than a finger to see it done. "
 BRG.5011.a:0 "The Reichsführer-SS will be proud."

 BRG.5012.t:0 "Outpouring of Support for the Tsar's Crusade"
 BRG.5012.d:0 "The patriotic peoples of Russia have been whipped into a frenzy by the rumours of a coming war between ourselves and the communists to the north. Most all of those Russians who rightly abhor the socialist menace that once destroyed our empire have come over to our side, and even the civilians of the conquered territories are enthusiastic to see their Tsar emerge victorious over the WRRF. Support for conservative, pro-war parties and organizations across Vyatka and beyond is on the rise as citizens take to the streets to demonstrate in support of our regim, and our stockpiles of manpower are being helped along by this outpouring of support too, recruiters reporting a sharp uptick in recruitment into the Imperial Army. With peace and stability at home and more men ready to fight and die for the Tsar than we ever before, we have never been more ready for a showdown against the revolutionary menace than we are today."

 BRG.5013.d:0 "lthough it seemed that the ever-feuding degenerate Slavs would never manage to rise above their puny squabbles, at last the process of natural selection is playing out, and the warlords are beginning to consolidate. Now we can bring Operation Black Bear -- to undermine the stability of the "democratic" Russian states and help push the Slavic people as a whole into another war with the Reich. As is the path set out by our glorious Reichsfurher-SS, we will set the inferiors against each other, until in their weakness and stupidity they plunge headlong into the great global cleansing, from which the new Aryan order will arise."
 BRG.5013.a:0 "They shall set the world ablaze."

BRG.5014.t:0 "A Meeting at Midnight"
BRG.5014.d:0 "There was a stillness on the river Ob that night. A sense of emptiness, a hunger. It was as if every plant and animal was holding their breath. There was no moon in the sky. The stars were concealed behind clouds. There was only blackness. Gaping, yawning, waiting. \n\nAnd then, just past midnight, a man stepped into the clearing. He looked up at the empty sky, down at the cold dark water, and then intently at the path from which he had come. He too was silent. He too was waiting. \n\nNot much later, a second man arrived. The two men glanced at each other, and without speaking drew small coins from hidden pockets. Twin runes were set on the silver, barely visible amidst the darkness. \n\nThe first man was a river-trader, a well known pillar of the community in Vyatka. He was known to give alms to the beggars and candy to the children. The second was a printer from Komi. He was a recluse, but would sometimes come to gatherings. When he did, it was a cause for great celebration, as he told stories of enemies near and far, battles one and battles lost, of heroism and tragedy. \n\nThey were agents of the SD division of the SS-Burgundy. They had one purpose: to unleash chaos and cruelty among the Russian lands, and so further the higher purposes of the Reichsfurher-SS.\n\nThe Agents spoke quietly, quickly, and with as few words as possible. Their work in the west was done, it was time to bring the rightful punishment of the Untermensch to Siberia, and move Operation Bar one step closer to completion."
BRG.5014.a:0 "The Shadow State has a far reach."

 BRG.5015.t:0 "A New Arrival"
 BRG.5015.d:0 "There were many empty houses in the city of Orenburg. More often than not the refugees had brought large families that preferred safety in numbers, and the city had lost many of its residents in the wars and raids. The residents of the "Vienna of the Urals" had grown used to the derelict buildings, and were thus rather surprised when overnight one of the hovels transformed into a thriving business. \n\nA new printmaker had arrived, moved in from Komi. He was a genial fellow, who preferred to speak as little as possible of his business and much more about the hectic politics of the Russian wastes. It was unclear who exactly used his business, but they surely seemed to be generous as the presses were turning day and night. In time, the townsfolk grew used to their new neighbor, and ceased to wonder about such things. After all, they were just suddenly realizing the grave danger their precious city state was in, as the great warlords to the east and west alike hovered predatorily overhead. The other nearby principalities were experiencing a similar burst of suspicion and fear, and old wounds and grievances between the Ural states soon resurfaced. \n\nEach passing day seemed to bring another wild rumor of the cruelties and madness of enemies near and far, spurred on, just maybe, by the extraordinarily well-designed fear-mongering posters that had sprouted on every corner. Meanwhile, the printshop stayed lit and humming well into the night, as Orenburg's newest citizen told his stories and performed his dark work."

 BRG.5016.d:0 "In a place as chaotic as the Russian Wastes, in a state as new as ours, it is only to be expected that the public might be...skeptical... about submitting to the lawful authority. However, it seems that this understandable impulse has escalated into a full blown plague of disillusionment and rebellion. Everywhere the public heaps scorn on our government. Old women spit on our soldiers. Little boys throw rocks at the heads of our magistrates. Unless we do something soon, our control over West Siberia might well be short lived."

 BRG.5017.t:0 "In the Dead of Night"
 BRG.5017.d:0 "It was midnight, the ground around the arms depot was shiny with frost, reflecting the stars above. Despite the chill, the soldiers were drowsy from a long day of training, and all but asleep on their feet. Suddenly from within the main storage building, there came a colossal explosion. The guards were thrown forward, and though they survived with only minor injuries, they could only watch helplessly as a great portion of our arms stockpile went up in smoke. This is but one of many incidents seemingly aimed at sabotaging our ability to wage war, and no doubt the fault of those two-faced traitors in West Russia."

 BRG.5018.d:0 "Mikhail underlined the number at the end of his ledger. Excellent, another node on his expanding network of river traders had begun turning a healthy profit. Leaning back in the leather chair he had recently set up in his warehouse, he lit a cigar.

But some luxuries a man of his wealth co- \n\n"Numbers are looking good, I see?"\n\nMikhail's instincts from a war long ago and decades working in one of the most dangerous professions in the Russian Anarchy kicked in the second the German-accented voice floated out of the dark of the warehouse. His hand found the lovingly maintained Tokarev hidden under the armrest of his chair, and within seconds he had adopted a standing firing stance. When he saw the figure emerge out of the dark, he however lowered his weapon. "Werner? You mad bastard, I almost shot you! What are you doing in Vyatka? I've never seen you east of Kostroma!"\n\nThe pale, skeletally thin Volga German held up a cigarette, and Werner lit it with his cigar. "You are one to speak about where I should and should not appear, Mikhail. You know as well as I do that we rarely had to meet because of our man in Komi. Without him, I sometimes have to make these trips myself, as do you."\n\nHe took a deep inhale of the cigarette. "But enough about old times. I see you have made quite the name for yourself, you are trading all over West Russia now. This is good, your services will be needed if your... beloved tsar is to hold onto his realm."\n\nMikhail grinned; Werner's mysterious friend in Moskowien had always been his best customers.

That was the last one, now nobody who knew his face still drew breath. A shame he had been forced to neutralize such good friends and long-term business partners, but at the end of the day they were untermensch and he was an übermensch, there could never be permanent friendship between them in the eternal struggle of the races.\n\nThe pale Volga German turned to the Russian's safe, the one the trader had unlocked a thousand times in his presence. What idiots these Slavs were, no surprise the Old Führer had declared they should be scoured from the Earth with the other unworthy.\n\nHaving stuffed his suitcase with the Russian's collection of Reichsmarks, Werner hurried to the docks. All around him the city was abuzz with war preparations, he saw marching columns, propaganda posters and worried citizens discussing a return to rationing. The time was almost nigh, and Werner smiled.\n\nAs he entered the riverboat headed down the Volga-Kama network once plowed by Werner's smugglers, he noted the crew. Six of them, four passengers. One weapon, a rifle. Captain probably had a pistol too. Pathetic. Back in the day no riverboat would travel without an armed contingent. Sign of New Russia indeed. Oh well, should be a simple enough business taking them down once they approached Moskowien. It was time to go "home," finally see that supposed paradise his fellow SS men and the Reichsführer had created in Burgund. He raised his hat to the city behind him, whispering his goodbye so the crew would not hear him."

Globalplan Wolf focuses on one of the juciest prizes of all -- the Middle East. Already our agents have infiltrated the region, and now work to disturb the colonial order, wrecking havoc on global tensions and the supply of oil. Our short term focus is on excerbating tensions between the triumvirate rivals Italy and Turkey in Syria. A confrontation there would go a long way to unleashing a beautiful cycle of violence. In the longer term, we hope to make use of the gluttony and cowardice of the Egyptian King Farouk. In time, as our agents proliferate, we may consider even loftier plans."

 BRG_wolf.2.desc:0 "It is so convenient, that although we are certainly happy to help them on their way, the untermensch are often willing to be the agents of their own demise. In Egypt, the pathetic King Farouk is well known for his lust, luxorious tastes, and disdain for his people.

 BRG_wolf.3.t:0 "Laying the Bait"
 BRG_wolf.3.desc:0 "In the distant Southern Deserts of the Kingdom of Egypt, the nomads wandered miserably, looking for some humble hovel to spend the night. In the many farming settlements along the Nile, the peasants worked day and night for the chance to live another year, a future for their family, and maybe a small bottle of liquor to drain their sorrows. In the narrow streets of Cairo, the cityfolk begged and stole for a living, crouching in crumbling apartments devoid of light or water, despite the promises of the government that infrastructure improvements would be coming "soon".\n\nIn the palaces of King Farouk, it was party time. Exotic dancers from across the world gyrated on poles of solid gold, whole platters of caviar were passed around hors d'oeuvres, decorated cloth bags full of Cocaine were handed out as favors. The palace was always glowing with light, thundering with muscid, and reeking of the alcoholic excess within.\n\nFarouk was never one to be surpassed, and he out-drank the hardest German beer merchants and proprietors of Mexican tequila alike, he out-snorted even the most outrageous coke-addicts, and he ate more than a dozen portly British prostitutes combined.\n\nAround the king were clustered his closest friends and dearest enablers. For every line, bottle, and plate he consumed, they pressed two more in his hands. Despite their saccharine good cheer, they did not touch the delicacies themselves -- for they were true Aryans after all. This was merely another play in the game, one that would earn them profit in smuggling money yes, but more importantly one that would bankrupt the Egyptian government and bring the whole rotten untermensch edifice crashing to the ground."

Each of these factions is backed by one global power or another, all are heavily armed, and thanks to our help, at the point of war.

"Dedicated and disciplined, curious, yet intriguing." the Führer pondered, as he approached the Commanding Officer of the Freikorps units. "Oberstleutnant Käufer, I have been told? You and your men shall be greatly rewarded for your service towards the true patriots of the German Reich and the rightful heir to become the Führer. I must ask, of course: where is it that you and your men hail from?" \n\nA tense moment of silence adorned the conversation beyond the smiles, as the Oberstleutnant's bright eyes locked with Göring's pale, steely eyes. "Stuttgart, my Führer." the Commanding Officer stated as he offered the Führer a salute. As Göring addressed the Stuttgarter, he could not help but question the intentions and information given by this Oberstleutnant Käufer. However, as Käufer and his men walked away, Göring acknowledged that these men would fight for him, and that's all he needed."

SS국가지도자께서는 히틀러가 깨어날 때마다 건강이 나빠지는 것을 보며 기사단국의 특권을 바꿀 때가 되었다는 것을 인정하셨습니다. 오늘은 우리의 초점을 이러한 소규모 비밀 작전에서 보다 대담하고 세계적인 움직임으로 옮겨가는 날이며, 이는 핵 미사일 비축량의 영향과 핵 미사일이 SS국가지도자의 계획을 전달하는 능력에 따라 나뉠 것입니다. 더 이상 이 세계는 지금 있는 혐오와 부패의 구덩이에서 온몸을 더럽힌 채 허우적대지 않을 것이며, 매일같이 이 부패의 씨앗이 이 지구에 더 많이 뿌려지는 동안 가만히 서있지도 않을 것입니다. 만약 원자의 구름 속에서 이 세상이 멸망하는 것을 지켜봐야 한다 해도 말입니다."

"국가지도자 각하..."\n\n그는 그들의 손에서 푈키셔 베오바흐터를 낚아채 일면을 보았습니다. 주름이 가득한 총통의 흑백 초상화와 폭스할레 사진이 실려있었는데, 사진에서는 국방군이 폭스할레의 출입을 통제하고 구급대원이 안으로 달려들고 있었습니다. 신문에는 검고 진한 글씨로 "총통 암살 시도"라 쓰여있었습니다. 뭐? 시도?\n\n"암살이 실패했습니다." 장교가 탄식해며 말했습니다.

BRG_a_loyal_army_desc:0 "히틀러가 기사단국 건국에서 행한 첫 번째 실수는 SS국가지도자가 원하는 만큼 추종자를 부르도록 허용한 것이었습니다. 총통의 귀를 들어먹고 있는 썩어빠진 놈들에게 이것은 완벽한 생각처럼 보였습니다. 소위 광신자들은 더 이상 집 앞을 지나며 행진하지도 않고, 지키지도 못한 가치를 상기시키며, 그들 자신을 위해 건설한 퇴폐적인 낙원을 없애겠다고 위협했습니다.\n\n그러나 그것이 새로생긴 기사단국에 호재에 불과하다는 것이 밝혀졌습니다. 한때 충섬심이 의심되는 프랑스 "협력자"로 가득 찬 관료집단과 헌병대는 경험 많고, 능률적이며, 무엇보다도 헌신적인 군대로 대체되었습니다. 그들은 국가를 운영하고, 빨치산을 처단하고, 가장 가혹한 조건에서 싸우는 법을 압니다. 그리고 그들이 다시 싸우는 날이 곧 올지도 모릅니다."

"플란데런에 기어 들어와서, 나와의 만남을 요청하고, 무슨 문제가 있든지 도움을 기대할 수 있다고 생각하는 걸 보니 둘 중 하나지. 난 네 아첨꾼 두꺼비들 중의 하나가 아니야."\n\n"무엇이 문제냐가 아니라 누가 문제냐 하는 얘기지." 티리야르가 속삭였습니다. "드그렐."\n\n에릭손은 불쾌해했습니다. "그러니까 그 소문이 사실이라는 거지. 진지하게 그 새끼를 쓰러뜨리는 거라면 필요한 건 뭐든지 말해. 일주일만 주면 랑게마르크를 네 것으로 만들어 줄 거야."\n\n티리야르가 손을 내밀었지만 에릭손은 말했습니다. "하지만! 조건이 하나 있어. 난 너네가 진짜 미워하고 미워하고 미워할 거라는 걸 알고 있어!""

"모든 것이 정상인 것 같습니다, 연대지도자 각하. 지크 하일." 보초는 낮게 말한 후 냉정하게 경례를 하고 검문소 안으로 다시 들어갔습니다. 출입구가 열리고 호송차가 막힘없이 빠져나갔습니다. 에릭손이 똥이라도 씹은 듯한 미소를 지으며 발로니엔 보초들에게 손을 흔들자, 티리야르는 노트와 지도를 꺼냈습니다. 다음은 어디로 가야 될까요?"

BRG_huntdegrelle.9.desc:0 "The line of trucks headed by a black Benz sedan pulled to a stop at the fortified border checkpoint. Although the sight would be unusual in much of the Ordensstaat, one of the few autonomies the Walloon Legion retained was the right to police their own regional borders. While the leader of the Legion would ostensibly have no problem crossing, discontent was considerably higher in the ranks since the hunt for their beloved former leader began. Thankfully, soldiers in the convey had already been vetted and were equally devoted to the cause as Thiriart.\n\nThe Benz's rear window rolled down as a guard approached, revealing Thiriart and Erikkson sitting in the back. "Bonjour, soldier!" Thiriart beamed. "Official business on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Here are the papers, they should all be in order."\n\nThe guard took the papers and glanced at them with a disapproving sneer before shoving them back into Thiriart's hands. "Denied, per my Sturmbannführer's orders."\n\nThiriart's smile vanished. "No, soldier, I don't think you understand. I am  your Sturmbannführer's commanding officer, acting on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Now let me through, and we will forget about this. But if you don't, when word gets back to Ost-Paris, I-"\n\n"Heaven is high and Himmler is far away," the guard flatly responded before turning around and marching back into the checkpoint's office. The disloyal Legionnaires raised their guns, all targeted squarely at Thiriart's car. The message was clear, so the convoy reluctantly reversed.\n\nThiriart was not bluffing when he said Ost-Paris would hear. His report reached the Reichsführer-SS's desk, and he eagerly awaits his leader's word on how to deal with these insubordinate elements."

BRG_huntdegrelle.10.desc:0 "When Thiriart returned to the Walloon border checkpoint, he was ready. He didn't ride in the backseat of a Benz, but an armored car, and he was preceded by three dozen of the Legion's finest and a barrage of mortar fire. IT was a level of firepower that the traitorous Legionnaires were not expecting, but as a testament to their training, they stood firm and returned fire.\n\nThe fighting soon settled into an uneasy stalemate, with the soldiers at the checkpoint unable to repel Thiriart, and Thiriart unable to storm the checkpoint without charging across the open road. But as the day dragged on and the fear of the other side receiving reinforcements grew, desperation forced their hands. The traitors attempted to advance from their positions, but they overplayed their hand; Thiriart, sensing an opportunity, ordered his men to charge. His timing was able to lessen the potential amount of casualties, but a good amount of Thiriart's force was killed during the charge and the ensuing room-to-room fighting in the checkpoint's offices.\n\nAs the evening began, the treasonous Sturmbannführer and the rest of his command staff were dead, with those few who surrendered being executed by Thiriart personally. A couple of the surviving traitors who professed ignorance as to who was shooting at them were merely stripped of their weapons and kept under close watch. With these distractions finally removed, the hunt for Degrelle could begin in earnest."

BRG_huntdegrelle.11.desc:0 "Schlosser's much-anticipated report on the hunt for Degrelle arrived on the Reichsführer-SS's desk, which he eagerly flipped through. Despite some initial setbacks, Thiriart and his squadron inspected a bunker that was ostensibly decommissioned and removed from records years ago. However, it was guarded by Walloon Legion soldiers who weren't part of any chain of command. The guards were taken by surprise, and the ensuing firefight was rather quick and had few loyalist casualties.\n\nIn one of the bunker's rooms, they came across two rogue Legionnaires concluding the impromptu cremation of a body. They were quickly killed by the loyalists and the fire was doused; although the body had been severely burned by the fire, it could still be identified as a middle-aged man in an SS officer's uniform. An exit wound at the top of the skull indicated that he had shot himself shortly before his body was burnt, meaning he had likely committed suicide within a day of the bunker raid.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS opened an envelope that accompanied the report, thumbing through grisly photos of the charred corpse. Nauseating as the scene was, it certainly looked enough like Degrelle. He queasily returned the pictures to their resting place, and let out a sigh of relief. Schlosser's report concluded by mentioning that since the news of the raid spread, there was significantly more quiet in the ranks of the Legion. It wasn't certain that Degrelle was dead, but in these trying times, it was good enough for now."

"SS-Sturmbannführer Saint-Antoine, reporting for duty."\n\n"Ah, you're just the man I wanted to meet!" Thiriart beamed. "Tell me, why did you deny my previous attempt to cross the border?"\n\n"There have been several industrial accidents that damaged roads and other infrastructure," the Sturmbannführer recited by rote, "overland travel is impossible for the time being."\n\n"I see," replied Thiriart, unfazed. "I have several dozen men here. Could they not help with the cleanup?"\n\n"One of the accidents was at a chemical plant and caustic toxins have contaminated the environment. It will be at least a week before the area is sufficiently cleaned up."\n\n"And why have I not been informed of an accident of such magnitude?"\n\n"The report must have become lost, sir. I shall launch an inquiry into what happened and send a new one posthaste."\n\n"Right. Adieu."

Soon, the trucks were speeding past the pastures of Walloonia, and Thiriart was radioing in to other truck leaders to coordinate the beginning of the investigation. Unsurprisingly, there was no evidence whatsoever of any chemical plant leaks or industrial accidents.\n\nThis treachery was not exclusive to rogue members of the Walloon Legion. While Thiriart and his expedition  waited, Bert Erikkson and the SS-Legion Langemarck lambasted them for their so-called incompetence and failure to control their own men. If Thiriart was able to swallow his pride and approach Erikkson for assistance, the whispers went, then they already would have captured Degrelle by now.\n\nHowever, now was not a time for petty military rivalries or ethnic tensions. A traitor to the Ordensstaat was out there, and he needed to be caught..."
