 BRG_collapse.100.desc:0 "It is the nature of the subhuman to creep through the cracks and leak into the golden genetic line of the supreme Aryan warriors who make up the truly worthy population of this Earth. However, no matter how worthy they may be, the disgusting tendrils of corruption have always been a great source of destruction for the Aryan. Once more, we find ourselves facing this destruction again.\n\nDeep within the heartlands of former French territory, where the most corrupt and degenerate culture to ever have the unfortunate chance to rot this world, has taken the sanctity of another group, in stoking the flames of treason throughout the land as so many claim independence and wage war against their rightful lords in the Ordensstaat. Our own units within the Schutzstaffel have decided to defy the orders of their superiors in the Ordensstaat, and proclaim themselves as some abominable form of independent from our command. Whether it be from starvation, degenerative brainwashing, or some other foulness upon the world, these men have defied the Reichsführer-SS; therefore, they must pay the price for their defiance.\n\nAlready, the soldiers of our forces have mustered in preparation to wage glorious war against the defiant. If the defiant rebellion seeks to insult the Aryan way of life like this, then they shall be exterminated alongside the rest."
 BRG_collapse.100.a:0 "Birds of a feather..."
 BRG_collapse.101.t:0 "REPORT: Indicators of Imminent Collapse"
 BRG_collapse.101.desc:0 "FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY TO THE REICHSFÜHRER-SS \n\nSUB: INDICATORS OF IMMINENT STATE COLLAPSE \n\nSUMMARY: Over the past several weeks, there have been a significant number of signs and indications that the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is facing an immediate state collapse and centralized control is on the verge of being lost. \n\nThere are multiple SS Legions who are acting independently of orders from Ost-Paris and other centralized SS command nodes. It is unclear if they are acting on their own, or from other traitorous officers. The capability of internal security is dismal, and they are incapable of investigating and clamping down on these treasonous activities. \n\nPartisan attacks and movements are continuing to take place, with insufficient security to prevent theft, exfiltrations, sabotage, and terrorism. The Red Poppy movement, dominated by French partisans, is taking advantage of the poor security to advance their own objectives, which include the destruction of the Ordensstaat and the expulsion of all Germans from former French territory. \n\nOur border security has similarly declined as the overall situation has deteriorated, and there are almost certainly foreign agents operating in the Ordensstaat, potentially fueling insurrectionist and resistance movements. We have insufficient resources to deal with them. \n\nIt is estimated that if drastic actions are not taken within thirty days, this trend will become irreversible. It is recommended that the security situation be rectified immediately. \n\nHEIL HIMMLER"
 BRG_collapse.101.a:0 "One chance left."
 BRG_collapse.102.t:0 "The Final Pages"
 BRG_collapse.102.desc:0 "Despite everything, Heinrich Himmler was still there.\n\nDespite the overwhelming chaos that had enveloped the Ordensstaat, the Reichsführer-SS himself was still standing among the ruins. What ruins they were, however! The ruins of a project, the ruins of a people, the ruins of a dream; they were his ruins, and yet he was the only one that could be blamed for them. And now, what could he do? Everything had come tumbling down around him, and the Aryan utopia he so-cherished now stood as a pile of rubble, infested by rebellious legions out to get him. Yes, for the first time since many years, Heinrich Himmler was afraid.\n\nAll was not lost, however: surely, there was a way to start again, maybe somewhere else! Surely, the good people of Germany were waiting for him to come back, and would welcome him with open arms as he'd shun the traitors to the fatherland. After all, the German people loved him, back then, and that was probably still the case, wasn't it? Yes, there had to be a way to begin again, he thought as he looked onto a nearby burning house. There had to be a way he could begin again in some other place, where he would have a clean slate to recreate his Aryan utopia anew, free of all the imperfections that had plagued the Ordensstaat. Or was it?\n\nNo, all of this was fantasy. Mere, pure, unabashed fantasy, created by a man who finally and at last realized the closeness of his impending death. Heinrich Himmler, the great Reichsführer-SS and champion of the Aryan race, was going to die, and such a fact had become a matter of when rather than if. He could try to run, yes, and he would try to run; but that wouldn't negate the fact that trying to save his own skin was at best a desperate endeavor. And now, only time would tell when the end would come."

 BRG_collapse.103.desc:0 "Heinrich Himmler had failed. He had, for lack of a better word, monumentally failed.\n\nSuch was one of the only observations he could make, as his bunker was on the edge of being breached. Whoever was behind the soon-to-be-opened doors did not concern him too much: whether it was Walloon or Charlemagne, they were all traitors to him, and it didn't matter much who fired the bullets, for the end result would still be the same. And yet, as the world crumbled around him, he could only feel regret, and hate; regret for not having accomplished more, and hate at himself for letting it all fall.\n\nAfter all, he was the one who allowed the Burgundian project to end up like this. It wasn't Pohl, or Ribbentrop, or any of the million yes-men he had executed during all these years; no; the only culprit here was himself, and all the doubt and hate he had accumulated through the year was finally reaching a boiling point. The situation was adamant: the Ordensstaat-Burgund, the last hope of the Aryan race, was collapsing before his very eyes, and he was the one to blame for it. And now, he was gonna die any minute now and, yet again, all because of himself. Yes, all of his enterprises had thoroughly failed, and all that remained was now a sad, pathetic man, alone in his own decrepit bunker, waiting to be shot like a dog.\n\nAs the doors of the bunker loudly opened, and as soldiers swarmed inside like flies, it was over. Himmler tried to run for safety, but there was nowhere left to go; and when a bullet shot by one of the numerous traitors went straight through his heart, his last thoughts were of Germany, and of how he had failed Her, as he collapsed on the ground."

It was this same arrogance that led the Reichsführer-SS and his closest advisors to assume that surely the French legions would not dare to use weapons of mass destruction against their German foes. After all, they were at their core cowardly and degenerate, and thus incapable of matching the will of the Aryan.\n\nBut the French SS legions had been for so long subsumed in the madness and hunger of the Ordensstaat that they had taken its ideology and made it their own.

Their purpose has been obviated; there is no longer anywhere for Ost-Paris' degenerates to run.\n\nAs ever, only service and death awaits those beneath our gaze."

  BRG_globalplan_elefant:0 "Globalplan Elefant"
  BRG_globalplan_elefant_desc:0 "With the situation in the Ordensstaat now confidently secure, we need not concern ourselves with the fate of our base. Now is the time to look outwards. Although the late Führer endured beyond his mishap with our agent, he was not long for this world. Ever since his fateful end, the world has fallen to chaos and anarchy. In this anarchy lies our future.\n\nThe Dark Continent is aflame, as our allies are helplessly locked into a costly yet tame conflict with the Americans, doing battle over the future of those far-flung lands. Perhaps if the right dominoes are felled, then this conflict could escalate into much more than just a battle between pawns upon the global chess board."

  BRG_sowing_the_seeds_of_discontent:0 "Sowing The Seeds Of Discontent"
  BRG_sowing_the_seeds_of_discontent_desc:0 "If The United States of America is a giant, then it is the most frail giant to ever have been born from the annals of history. In America, they say that their nation stands as a bastion of "liberty" and "freedom". Never before has weakness been so thinly veiled, for the nation is ruled by naught more than a cabal of Jews and delinquents who use their thin veil to milk the placated populace dry, as they seek to once again spread their shadow across the globe.\n\nThe weakness of the American nation can, however, be exploited. We shall mobilize our vast subversive resources to the United States, from where they'll begin their campaign to expose the wicked war of subjugation that their government fights in Africa. The American people have already sown the seeds, all we must do is water the plant and allow it to blossom into a beautiful display of discontent and unrest within the United States."

  BRG_growing_the_chaos:0 "Growing The Chaos"
  BRG_growing_the_chaos_desc:0 "Although the South Africans are not upon our "side" of the war in Africa, they are no good as a foe if they are defeated, and all efforts thus far undertaken by the Ordensstaat will have been for naught should Cape Town fall too easily. The dominoes simply cannot fall should they be stopped short by a premature South African surrender.\n\nThe temporary remedy to this is simple. We shall ensure that they are granted the means to continue their little struggle, so that we may continue setting the stage for a much more exciting act. The South Africans surely won't question whether they should have received any extra deliveries of "American" armaments."

  BRG_cutting_the_cords:0 "Cutting The Cords"
  BRG_cutting_the_cords_desc:0 "Whilst Hüttig and his Afrikan SS believe themselves to be the exemplars of guerilla warfare, succeeding in bogging down the tides of the South African War, they do not possess the unleashed freedom nor the resources required to cause true guerilla terror upon the African fronts.\n\nWe need only cut some of the strings which encumber our puppets in Africa, and grant them our remaining munitions and equipment so that they may be orchestrated to conduct true attacks of terror. No road shall be safe, and no bridge shall remain intact, as every step taken further into the heart of Africa shall become an ever more treacherous one."

  BRG_schencks_empty_tanks:0 "Schenck's Empty Tanks"
  BRG_schencks_empty_tanks_desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck and his Luftwaffe are a terror in the South African skies. There are few places of respite for one to flee the Südwestafrikan birds of prey. And this is precisely the issue. For every day the Luftwaffe dominates the skies of Africa, the road to Cape Town is opened to the Schild ever slightly more. We must buffer the Südwestafrkan air superiority so that the OFN may continue to fight and prolong the war for many more months to come.\n\nTo delay the Südwestafrikan aerial efforts, all we must do is ensure their aircraft face a sudden shortage of fuel. Achieving this will be simple. A few crucial oil shipments will be tragically sunk, as several vital oil and fuel lines become the target of "American sabotage". Not many aircraft engines will be spooling up upon Angolan and Namibian airstrips in coming days."

  BRG_mullers_broken_supply:0 "Müller's Broken Roads"
  BRG_mullers_broken_supply_desc:0 "The forces of the Zentralafrikan Reichskommissariat, despite being possibly the largest force among the Afrika-Schild, also faces the largest difficulties in participating in the war effort. Logistical challenges which cannot be facilitated by their partners in Ostafrika and Südwestafrika must be undertaken directly by them. Such logistical networks, which traverse half of the African continent, are rather fragile.\n\nWe need only block a few roads, detonate a few bridges, and devastate the Zentralafrikan canals, and their entire confused logistical structure will come to a grinding halt, forcing the entire Schild advance upon South Africa to screech to a near standstill."

  BRG_elefant_the_final_moves:0 "The Final Moves"
  BRG_elefant_the_final_moves_desc:0 "In every game of chess, there must be a conclusion. As the pieces are knocked down, and the pawns run thin, the King knows that it must make a decisive move for victory, else the King shall join the fallen pawns. Similarly, all wars must end. As men die and resources are expended, even the greatest of conquerors grow tired of combat.\n\nThe South African War winds down, and a conclusion is inevitable. Yet there are still measures to be taken to ensure that we secure for ourselves a favorable conclusion. Our man in Africa, Hans Hüttig, holds the key."

  BRG_out_of_the_shadows:0 "Out Of The Shadows"
  BRG_out_of_the_shadows_desc:0 "Hüttig is a bold man, yet the brevity which we require for our goals is far beyond what he has thus far displayed. We must embolden him and his Afrikan SS further, so that there may be no doubt of conflict escalation. And nothing is more emboldening than strength, or rather, the illusion of strength.\n\nWe shall ship out some of our very own military forces to Ostafrika at once. From there, they will be directly deployed into the fray, where they shall no doubt perform with deadly efficiency. Seeing such professional forces in action upon their side will surely grant untold confidence to the Ostafrikans, speeding their previously delayed efforts into motion."

  BRG_hiding_in_plain_sight:0 "Hiding In Plain Sight"
  BRG_hiding_in_plain_sight_desc:0 "Just as "American" armaments were discreetly shipped to the South Africans so that they could continue their fight, the Ostafrikans too require the means to fight. Whilst Hüttig has not been entirely strapped for armaments, if he is to be nudged towards larger efforts, he must have confidence in his stockpiles. We shall give him plentiful confidence."

  BRG_igniting_huttigs_rage:0 "Igniting Hüttig's Rage"
  BRG_igniting_huttigs_rage_desc:0 "The lush jungles of Ostafrika are home to many things. Exotic wildlife, tremendous sights, and an untold stockpile of chemical weapons. Lethal gases stockpiled throughout the final solution and conquest of Africa now rest securely within well concealed warehouses throughout Africa. It is a source of limitless potential.\n\nIf only Hüttig's fragile rage were to be truly ignited, and his bountiful gaseous weapons unleashed with his rage, perhaps this South African skirmish could evolve in a true war to end all wars..."

  BRG_the_call_to_arms:0 "The Call To Arms"
  BRG_the_call_to_arms_desc:0 "Heydrich is the only one of the participants of the Bürgerkrieg to hold true to National Socialism. The rest are traitors, their loyalty owed only to capital, haughty generals, or their own egoism. They will all meet their deserved end, as surely as the sun will rise. Yet, it is still incumbent upon us to ensure that the sun rises sooner than later. The German SS pales in comparison to the might of the Burgundian SS, and although we cannot afford to send the whole of our army into the Rhineland to dispatch with the traitors, we will do all that we can to support Heydrich in his rightful ascent to command over Germania. "

  BRG_in_heydrichs_wake:0 "In Heydrich's Wake"
  BRG_in_heydrichs_wake_desc:0 "A particular weakness of Heydrich's branch of the SS is the lack of due diligence with which it carries out the stabilization of the frontiers of war. When the German SS sweep into a conquered town, they might only find a dozen or so dissidents worthy enough to execute. Were the Burgundian SS to conduct the same operation in the same town, they would certainly kill at least a hundred. Heydrich's men can focus their efforts on the front lines of the war-pacifying the rear is a task best left to us."

  BRG_flood_the_border:0 "Flood The Border"
  BRG_flood_the_border_desc:0 "Bombs explode and bullets approach from the horizon all over the Reich, and this devastation has not been conducive to the manufacturing capability of Heydrich's swath of territory. If their own factors are not capable of sustaining the war, then it falls on us as his sponsor to fill in the gaps. Those loyal to Heydrich in the Reich who cannot find themselves a rifle of German make to fight with shall fight with a Burgundian one, and the border of the Ordensstaat and the Reich shall be flooded with all manner of war material. It is of a special importance to the Reichsführer-SS that Heydrich wins this war, and the sacrifice of a portion of our industrial capacity is far from too high a price to pay to meet this end."

  BRG_death_from_a_mile_away:0 "Death From A Mile Away"
  BRG_death_from_a_mile_away_desc:0 "The treacherous fiends that fight against a Reich that is truly National Socialist can best be described as 'snakes', and there is an old and a true adage about snakes and heads. A skilled marksman with a good rifle and an extra pair of eyes can turn a well disciplined enemy platoon into disorganized rabble; an excellent return on investment for our purposes. The best snipers our armies have to offer will be sent to the front line to assist Heydrich against the foe, and hopefully impart some of the fundamentals on to his own men. Only the steelest of men can hold fast when death comes from a mile away, and only our men are cut of true steel."

  BRG_terrorkampagne:0 "Terrorkampagne"
  BRG_terrorkampagne_desc:0 "The air is the most modern of the environs of war, and there too shall the torch of National Socialism hold sway. Every enemy fighter rendered into burning rubble and every enemy city rendered the same will be monuments to the Vaterland-they will be as bonfires, celebrating the victory of the German people over the traitor armies by burning alive the same treasonous swine that sought to corrupt our good women and men. The enemy will know terror, and he will tremble night and day at the thought that the next plane he hears flying overhead will be his last."

  BRG_leading_the_charge:0 "Leading The Charge"
  BRG_leading_the_charge_desc:0 "We are done "assisting" Heydrich in his war. Now, as the Bürgerkrieg intensifies, is time for us to lead the charge ourselves. The warriors of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund will show Heydrich's loyalists how to fight from example. Our divisions, on the frontline of our own Vaterland, will hold the candle marching into the darkness of the rotten world beyond. Every soldier that fights against us is guilty of treason, and will be afforded treason's legal penalty-as will any of Heydrich's forces who fail to live up to the standards we expect of them. Half-measures are fully over. It is time that Heydrich's attempt to seize power in the Reich either succeds or fails."

  BRG_the_spartan_phalanx:0 "The Spartan Phalanx"
  BRG_the_spartan_phalanx_desc:0 "The frustration of our counterparts in the German SS to achieve victory thus far can be attributed to a failure of leadership. As such, it is time that our seasoned leaders begin replacing the most incompetent and least racially pure of Heydrich's own counterparts. Many of his officers have shown talent in the civil war, and will maintain their charges. The rest will be gone, meeting the same fate that rightfully befalls any officer who neglects the responsibilities of command. Only those loyal to our regime and truly steadfast in their dedication to National Socialism have any place in the chain of command. A phalanx is only as formidable as its weakest shield."

  BRG_blot_out_the_sun:0 "Blot Out The Sun"
  BRG_blot_out_the_sun_desc:0 "Everything in the Ordensstaat capable of flight will be sent east to aid in the war. Our fighters will be mass produced at the tallest heights of production thought reasonable to mandate, and then 10% more. Our aircraft shall blot out the sun over the Reich, and the coming of the shade will be the coming of the SS. Ours is the side of the Bürgerkrieg of the most pure of the German people fighting for the most zealous interpretation of the German ideology, and we are equally proud of both. Let the gunfire raining from the sky be our testament to the ancestors of the German nation that we still hold to them, and we fight the traitors in their name."

  BRG_fire_and_brimstone:0 "Fire And Brimstone"
  BRG_fire_and_brimstone_desc:0 "Guns are not enough. Bombs are not enough. To destroy most of the enemy, to damage his industry moderately, to kill many of his men-it is not enough. We must have it all. They all must die, they all must crumble, they all must burn: and there are few weapons capable of achieving this totality of destruction. Thankfully for the nation, the superiority of German science has long conceived of an answer to the conundrum of moderation in warfare. All across the Ordensstaat, rocket facilities and weapons to launch from them are being constructed, that we might smite not a single enemy from a single mile away, but thousands of enemies from hundreds of miles away. When rockets rain down on the industrialists factories, liberal universities are obliterated in explosions, and the prides of generals are reduced to ash in their mouths at the site of the calamities befalling their armies, the only Germans left standing will be those standing behind our lines."

Recognizing this, their arrogance shall be their downfall, as already we have infiltrated the ranks of their independence movements and allowed for our agents to make headway in the leadership. We must expand these operations and forward more agents towards Iberia, as one by one these movements will find themselves in a state of unknown subjugation while we take control more and more, ramping up their potential turn towards violence and allowing for further openings of conflict as their actions grow greater and their movements grow stronger.

Knowing this, the scent of blood will flow through the air, as the Spanish will seemingly have a massive attack against them perpetrated by the damned Euskaldunak! In reality, however, our agents shall be watching this unfold, as the main forces behind the attack, and they'll be ready for when the Spanish send in their forces to massacre the people of the Basque, and unveil the true call to independence for them and for all minorities seeking Spanish blood!"

However, as men, women, and children tear themselves apart in their "precious" countrysides and disgustingly corrupted homes, the world looks on, seeking to intervene in some way as atrocity after atrocity is committed. Now is the time to hasten such atrocities, however, and ensure they multiply across every inch of the Peninsula, so that every single day may mark another splash of devotion from the world, and another burning sense of tension, chaos, and destruction dawns across the world!

These men have recognized their age as well, however, and have designated a successor to "save the Portuguese people from the potential fallout of the Iberian conflict." However, such a successor shall never find themselves capable in a people that hates them, will they?

Now, while he leads the most purified path in this Iberian conflict, such worries are not our priority; rather, we must ensure Bosch and his Falangists dedicate themselves to the blood of their cause more than ever before through failure met with gain, as they shall continuously know defeat and victory.

We shall relay supplies to these movements, greater and more deadly weaponry will be found in these separatists' armaments, and we shall watch onwards as the Spaniard and the Portuguese is mowed down by their former subjects!

However, they are ours to completely control as a puppet state completely tied to our grasp, and it is in this control that we will use these tribesmen to wreak havoc all across the Iberian Peninsula. Yes, it is true that many within the Ordensstaat may find the support of Communists in the world of today abhorrent, and may find the exercise to be too great a betrayal of our ideas to go through it, but such men do not possess the strength nor the will to see our operations completed, and will be dealt with as such.

This is where we shall benefit, however: the Asturians are one such bunch, who believe that through natural work together, then they shall harvest the Earth and its glories. Their faults will be our aid, however, as they shall work the land to death by command of our leadership, whilst every single cent is handed towards the Ordensstaat's wealth, rather than bolstering their own ranks.

Iberia is broken, Spain is destroyed, Portugal is dead, and we have benefitted each and every step of the way, both in operations and in investments. The world has sunk its entire attention towards the blood which floods the lands of the peninsula, while the coffers of the Ordensstaat stand bloated from all of the sales and investments coming forth from the entirety of our actions across that accursed Peninsula. The time has come for the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund to take its hand off of 세계계획 콘도르, and allow our splendors to rain forth from the Hell that is now Iberia."

While on one hand he is supremely unsuited for the role of Führer, being soft-hearted and tending towards tolerating politically and racially questionable characters, he also differs from his opponents through genuine competence and recognition of the Reich's many failings. That is however also why he must be weakened and pushed towards a more hardline policy. We cannot risk having him trying to turn back the clock to 1932, or worse, seek detente with the Japanese and Americans. As such, as much as it pains us, we must rally the supporters of statism and degeneracy against his rule; for the good of the race the Volk must be allowed to slide further."

 BRG_stable_no_more_desc:0 "Due to Speer's weakness of character and courage, he has not dared properly purging the supporters of his opponents. While most of the handful of SS supporters have fled to us or into the vast Reichskommissariats, many of the bureaucrat fatcats of Bormann and armchair generals of Göring still waddle around the hallowed halls of Germania.

While this is not... wholly untrue, it is still a grave disrespect to the important work of the SS-Totenkopfverbande and other loyal servants of the Race. While we don't mind him blaming that useless sot Heydrich, it was his damn conference that started it all in the first place, he also names the Reichsführer, Adolf Eichmann, and many other prominent Burgundians as partakers in these actions. Our propagandists have prepared a wave of underground "newspapers" with articles instead blaming most of the mass death on Albert Speer's slavery system and brutal usage of the slaves. Let us see how he likes being slandered."

 BRG_failure_for_their_friends_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, so with some strategic raids by "partisans" on the Heer's supply lines we can ensure the soldiers stay hungry, disgruntled, short on ammunition and are left generally in poor combat condition. Even if they still win, the road there will be long and tortuous, the blame pointing squarely at Germania."
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_text:0 "Find the Weak Links"
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_desc:0 "On the surface Göring's support base seems solid, but in reality many of his supporters view him with skepticism, for example the militarist leader, General Schörner.

All we really need to do is make sure they are encouraged to continue."
 BRG_der_entruckung_text:0 "Der Entrückung"
 BRG_der_entruckung_desc:0 "It appears the latest target for Göring's wild ride of military conquest is... the Ordensstaat. This is unfortunate, but not unexpected. The Oberkommando in Germania is fearful about our nuclear arsenal, which we can use to our advantage. If we can rush the SS into German territory, local silo commanders or even the Oberkommando themselves might panic and order the deployment of part of their nuclear arsenal. With how tense the Americans and Japanese are over German resurgence, that should be more than enough to trigger a global conflict. We must ready ourselves for Rapture, Ragnarök is upon us!"

 BRG_globalplan_adler_decisions:0 "§R세계계획 아들러§!"
 BRG_globalplan_adler_decisions_desc:0 "The Reich, what once was the glimmering hallmark of Aryan Masterdom against a world of putridity, in which the Vaterland would stand triumphant against the Judeo-Bolshevists who would dare call themselves equal to our mighty grasp, has since fallen into a despairful pit of decadence, sin, and treason. So great is the extreme putridity characterizing the Reich that it fell into its own horrific Civil War, pitting the Germanic Master Race against itself in a horrific gladiatorial arena throughout the Reich. Now, however, only one false Führer stands to call themselves leader of the Aryan people, gutting the strength of the Germanic people even more as they feed the bloated corpse of the Reich more lies every passing day in order to maintain the survival of their unholy power. However, while this sickly beast continues to crawl through the mud of this world to try to find power, the Ordensstaat poised to strike, ready to do all we can to bring down this fallen behemoth who once dared called themselves the masters of this solemn world. And with how deranged the country has become, it shall not be long until they aid greatly towards the Reichsführer-SS's plan..."

 ###Events

 BRG_adler.1.t:0 "Shadows on the Rail"
 BRG_adler.1.d:0 ""Agents Ten, Twelve, Thirteen, Thirty-Three, make way upon the railing above." Echoed the earpieces of the Aryan servants of the Ordensstaat's shadow. Thus, the men descended from the roof onto the dark balconies above, hidden away under the shadow of the night as their rifles came ready to use upon the floor below. \n\nThe factory doors came to a crash as the men entered the room, ready to meet just whoever so happened to have contacted the legendary Businessman of the Reich at this time of the night. "Uh, hello, anyone there?" said the Businessman, in the most regal attire of a trenchcoat as his guards smoked cigars. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." echoed a voice from the darkness, as a man took a few paces to greet the entourage upon their entrance into the area. "Supposing, at this time of the night, you'd enjoy the skipping of pleasantries so that business may be conducted?" the man said, adorned in mystery. Flick shook his head slowly in response. "Well, then allow me to begin. You see, there are elements of this world which lurk under the watchful eyes of Dictators, Generals, the Reich, and even the Führer himself, Herr Flick. Elements of this world which would like to see themselves involved in the meandering of Speerian governing, and are willing to pay handsomely for it." The man said, opening a briefcase full of Reichsmarks. \n\nWith the dark room laid to silence, Herr Flick continued to ponder the question for just a few minutes, until finally, his eyes brightened up. With a shaking of hands, the Reichsmark were taken that day, and the Ordensstaat had a way straight to Speer's heart. \n\n"Alright, gentlemen, lay down your rifles." the Man said, as the clambering of military gear being set down began."
 BRG_adler.1.a:0 "Terror to some, greatness for us."

 BRG_adler.3.t:0 "The Facade of a Million Shadows"
 BRG_adler.3.d:0 "The Office of the Führer deep within the Halls of Germania was once embellished with the great calls for glory from the illustrious Adolf Hitler, the marching, arm-locked-in-arm, of Generals discussing the glory of the Reich's conquests, and the countless citizens of Germania enjoying, for themselves, the Empire which gave them dominion over the world. Now, however, the Führer himself lies in silence, begging himself not to take another cigarette in fear of his health, hand clasped in hand, as he stares into the distance, telephone in hand. \n\n"My Führer, the ongoing protests within several of the Reich's universities are not, I repeat, not at the hands of remaining Civil War elements. A series of documents have been circulating to the public, sir. A series of documents about you, my Führer." the voice said gravely over the telephone. \n\n"What do they say, Gruppenführer?" Speer said, being met with a few moments of silence. "Gruppenführer, what the hell did they say?" the Führer said, in a mix of terror and great, seething anger. \n\n"Sir, they. They discuss information regarding your participation in the extended extermination of non-Aryans over the course of the Second World War and the years following." The military leader said, sending the painful shiver of horror straight into the void that made up the Führer's soul. "Students are responding in organization over the issue, asking you directly for answers, my Führer." \n\nThe realization of the painful setback of progress for the Reich shook Speer. No longer could he work towards securing his position of leadership in the Reich riding upon the pure faith of the reformists without answering towards the untold truths which lie at his feet. What has begun must be dealt with as always, however."
 BRG_adler.3.a:0 "I will handle it personally, Gruppenführer."

 BRG_adler.4.t:0 "A Devoted Soul"
 BRG_adler.4.d:0 ""So, Herr Flick, you have provided that, under the direct submittance of an additional seven and a half million Reichsmarks, that you shall be within immediate compliance towards general coordinated statements forwarded by our office, am I correct?" the icy, rasped voice of the Reichsführer-SS echoed out over the telephone towards the Businessman of the Reich. \n\n"National Socialism brought greatness to the Reich, it made the Reich whole. I am more than willing to do what I can as a true patriot to the German country and her people and stave off Speer's corruption; however, I simply have a few questions. Firstly, what will I be doing in accordance with our agreement, what do I have to do to ensure we do right by the Reich?" Flick said, meeting silence on the other end of the line. "And what about anonymity? My name is going to be scratched off of any documents regarding our deals and whatnot, correct?" Flick asked again. Meanwhile, the phone line continue to meet his expectations with a droning monotone. \n\n"You will find out soon, Herr Flick, but do not worry: no one shall know of our deals, and the millions you have earned from them." the Reichsführer-SS stated, as the phone line hung up. Six hundred miles apart from one another, both men took steps back from their chair, and readied themselves for the coming future."
 BRG_adler.4.a:0 "His patriotism shall be our gain."

 BRG_adler.5.t:0 "Bloody Ferdinand's Escape"
 BRG_adler.5.d:0 ""That's fucking bullshit, Kessler, there's no way in Hell that He could have gotten out of that compound that quickly, we had our men on every door into the goddamn place!" Wedekind said, crashing his cigar to the ashtray in anger. "The Führer is asking for our goddamn department to handle this, and we can't even find this shithead!" he said, filling the office with anger. \n\n"When did the unites at the East entrance last report?" Kessler said, as he continued to stare straight at the map below him on the table. \n\n"What the fuck are you talking about, Kessler? Twenty-Six hours ago, right after they went on patrol when they lost this monster, remember the damn report?" Wedekind said. \n\n"That's what I mean. Get a report from them, now. Find where they are, who they're with, their names, everything." Kessler said, as Wedekind confusingly went off to fulfill the task at hand. An hour later, the creaky door opened back into the investigation room as Wedekind made his way back into the room, report in hand and sunken eyes to match. "What's it say?" Kessler said. \n\n"Killed. Slaves got them, every last one of them, beat them to death with a few stab wounds in each." Wedekind responded. \n\nThe two men sat in a cold, silent anguish over the thoughts of what happened. That was before Kessler shot out his chair and grabbed Wedekind. "Wedekind, you listen here and you listen close. Look at that map and tell me, where in the Hell did slaves come out of nowhere when their nearest compound is dozens of miles away?" Kessler said, filling Wedekind with a great fear of the unknown."
 BRG_adler.5.a:0 "I-I don't know."

 BRG_adler.8.t:0 "The Pilot's Flight"
 BRG_adler.8.d:0 "The Reichsführer-SS sat patiently, quietly, and coldly, dancing his fingers upon the table as he waited for the incoming report his presence had been requested for. And, as  if on cue by the grand director of this wretched life, Ernst Kaltenbrunner came in, manilla folder in hand. "Glory to the Reichsführer-SS." stated the Nazi towering over the desk, offering his greatest Nazi salute. "Sir, these cold mornings have allowed for us a great victory in the fall of the succumbing Reich." he said, handing his superior the folder. \n\nAs the papers flipped by, the Reichsführer-SS continued to understand the meaning of these messages. That Fat Pig claiming to be the Führer as he waddled around, medallions in hand, is marching onward towards a new Grand War Strategy, dubbed "War Plan B," dedicated towards the annexation of further territories in the ravaging quest for new splendors for the Reich in their new failure. The Turkish, the Iberians, the Italians, the Russians, the Syrians, and the Africans would all come to meet a wall of the Reich's soldiers if all would go according to the plans of the decadent Hermann Göring. \n\n"Return to your duties, Herr Kaltenbrunner." the Reichsführer-SS said, as his underling marched off. Finally, it was time for the Ordensstaat to begin the immediate production of arms and equipment for these nations, and finally get involved with a little "foreign aid" in order to play catch up with the Reich's forward motion, and ensure their collapse comes yet."
 BRG_adler.8.a:0 "Göring will fail yet."

 BRG_adler.11.t:0 "Conquest on the Horizon"
 BRG_adler.11.d:0 "Ernst Kaltenbrunner once again found his way into the Reichsführer-SS's office as he twisted and turned down the halls of the High Command of the Ordensstaat. "Heil Reichsführer-SS." he said with a strong salute, yet exasperated and fearful breath. "Our agents have discovered immediately pertinent intelligence regarding the Führer's plan with the Ordensstaat, sir." He said, shifting the thick manilla folder towards the Reichsführer-SS's face. \n\n"I shall handle this personally, Herr Kaltenbrunner. You are dismissed, for now." the Reichsführer-SS said, as Kaltenbrunner shut the iron door behind him. Opening the document in front of him, the Reichsführer-SS's eyes' meeting of the words "Fall Schwarz" brought a great discovery to his mind... \n\nThe greatest key to the Plan he has ever found. \n\nThus, the Reichsführer-SS prepared. Yes, it was true that this a great discovery for the benefit of the future; however, how could he hope to achieve success if the plans were not in place? Allowing the Reich to run over and invade the Ordensstaat was an obvious impossibility if he sought to enact the Plan. Thus, he would have to prepare the great and mighty Aryans of the Ordensstaat to pledge every single man, every single resource, and every single bullet, towards waging a great war with the Rech. This would be their fate. This was destiny."
 BRG_adler.11.a:0 "Ragnarök awaits."

 BRG_adler.13.t:0 "Keep your Enemies Closer"
 BRG_adler.13.d:0 ""And that's how you managed to keep those Russian regiments on the run at Suslov? Tell me, tell me, what happened after the battle, Gruppenführer?" the amicable Walther Hewel stated, laughing as he ate. \n\n"Well, that's where I earned this." the SS-Gruppenführer stated as he pointed in the large scar across his left cheek. "The Russians had just enough explosives planted in their retreat to make it work, and took out a swathe of my man, and left me blind in my left eye for quite some time. But the Aryan does not give in, Mr. Hewel, he does not give up." The SS-Gruppenführer stated, causing the Foreign Minister of the Bormann administration to roar with laughter and giddiness towards the tale of war and bloodshed. "You are one mighty creature, Gruppenführer, a Lion in the company of Mice! Please, here is my personal office's telephone number, do be sure to call and we can talk anytime, they give me whatever I want up there, and you can get well paid in turn!" said Hewel, as he got up from the leather chair and walked away to grab more food, as the SS-Gruppenführer called \n\n"Sir, I would request one favor of you." he said to the listening Walther Hewel. "Stay evermore devoted to the glorious Führer Bormann, a true patriot." Hewel offered a smile and nod as he walked off. The SS-Gruppenführer, however, could not understand the nature of the operation. Why would the Reichsführer-SS desire to support the foundations of these idiots? Hewel could hardly keep himself contained and became a walking embarrassment over a small story of War in the West, how could we support these degenerates? The Reichsführer-SS must have a plan, and faith will be required if he sought the will to maintain this position and earn the Ordensstaat an inside to this entire spider web in the Reich."
 BRG_adler.13.a:0 "Degenerates, all of them."

 BRG_adler.14.t:0 "Strange Waters"
 BRG_adler.14.d:0 "The Führer, Martin Bormann, worked diligently upon his desk in his office in Germania. Everyday, incoming military, political, and economic reports gave new and rising situations regarding the Reich and her troubles, whilst the Führer himself offered estimations and calculations about how to conceptualize fixes for all these messes. One such mess required not fixing, yet still occupied Bormann's mind for quite some time: what was going on to cause the recent outspoken support from so much of the Administration, especially in a perilous time like this? \n\n"My Führer! Just the man I wanted to see!" said the Foreign Minister, Walther Hewel, as he crashed through the office. "I just had the most wonderful conversation at the Party Rally yesterday, sir, and I was reminded of just what I needed to do!" the Minister said, loudly for this time in the morning. \n\n"Ah, really? And what is it that you must do at a time like this, Hewel?" Bormann asked with a degree of annoyance and scorn as he lit a cigarette. \n\n"Well, sir, that's just it: it's you! The mighty Führer, Martin Bormann, who saved the Reich from collapse and preserved the legacy of the mighty Adolf Hitler! You have made our lives and prosperity possible, and no one seems to be cheery enough to say that anymore, sir! Thank you, and, remember, my office is always free to offer you what I can provide!" Hewel said, as he pat Bormann on the back and left. \n\nAnd there it was again. Another leader in the administration, overjoyed at everything Bormann was doing. This couldn't be right: the Reich was still facing issues, and as much as Hewel may be a fool, he wasn't just so easily able to overlook that. What was going on with the administration to flood these compliments? Then again, perhaps, the Führer thought to himself, maybe it was just time to offer himself some more credit for once."
 BRG_adler.14.a:0 "To worry or not?"

 BRG_adler.15.t:0 "A Phantom of Sorrows and Wealth"
 BRG_adler.15.d:0 "The brick and mortar walls of this ancient fortress filled the Businessman with fears of the children's stories of phantoms of Germany's past. However, he knew a great deal more about the terror able to be enacted by the phantoms he was surrounded with, whether it be the soul-draining nature of Speer's corruption, or the paralyzing fear of the men he worked with now. Thus came the terror as the Businessman turned and saw the the Scarred Giant of the Schutzstaffel enter the office. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." spoke the menacing voice that flowed through the Giant. \n\n"Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner, it is an honor." stated Flick, with a slight hint of mistruth as his terror ensured the tension of the meeting. \n\n"Sit down, Herr Flick. We have much to discuss." said Kaltenbrunner, as he came around to sit beside the Businessman. "Herr Flick, it has come under the understanding of your devotion to the cause of National Socialism, and your willingness to support the cause through the tragedies of the modern day which harm it so greatly. Thus, in accordance with your transactionary deals, your immediate orders are to cede as great a percentile of operations for your industries towards Führer Bormann's regime immediately." Kaltenbrunner said. \n\n"This is an outrage, those are my profits, my hard earned business success! How could we support that fool in times like these, this is treachery, this is an insult!" shouted Flick. \n\n"Herr Flick, you will understand the orders you have been provided and see they come into fruition or else face the bylaws of our contract." stated Kaltenbrunner as the two SS guards in the back took a step forward. As Flick sat back down, he could not help but cede his own will to the Scarred Giant across from him."
 BRG_adler.15.a:0 "It must be done."

 BRG_adler.16.t:0 "Reports, Redactions, and Removals"
 BRG_adler.16.d:0 "The pleasing mild successes accomplished by the Führer and his administration, managing to keep a smile plastered onto the people's faces had been assailed by a new confusing issue. The Führer continued to look onward, enjoying his organization and structure as a Master of the Bureaucrats, and, yet, something was wrong. Very wrong. As Bormann searched and scurried through his office, running his hand over every drawer and cubby, something was gone. \n\nMissing. \n\nSeveral things were. Yet, also, things that weren't here at the last point the Führer had come into his office had made their way onto his shelves and cases, when his secretary hadn't requested file transfers or anything of the sort! The matter brought sweat to the already-hardworked Führer's forehead, as the panic and confusion and paranoia of dissent and trickery plagued his mind. No, this couldn't have been, this was a simple trick, a mistake in the wake of the Führer's great work across the Reich taking up so much of his own time. However, in that slight chance, what if it truly is someone else instead? The Führer knew not, as he set his pen down and grasped his face, trying to ease his tensions."
 BRG_adler.16.a:0 "Get a hold of yourself."

Although its subversion is not as crucial to our plans as a few others, Italy holds much exploitable economic opportunities we can use for funding, stagnant cocoons of liquid gold awaiting our knives to plunge into. These manifest in holes in the integrity of the corporatist hierarchy, corrupt fascists willing to tear themselves open for counterfeit lire. The colonial order will be sustained until we have drained every last drop. Rome will suckle on our breasts, not knowing that our wolves are laced with poison. Here's to the tragedy to ensure."

Toppling the fragile colonial orders of both down until a region-spanning war occurs would allow our plans in the Middle East to come into fruition. To do this, we will fund paramilitaries and terrorists to wreak havoc for our machinations. Palestinian liberation parties will inspire intercommunal violence, Jewish ultranationalists will massacre villages, and the incompotent adminstrators will utterly fail to resolve the crumbling wall that seperates the northern and southern corridors of Lebanon.

Their dreams of glory will be fulfilled, or we will manufacture the dream. To do this, we have devised a variety of methods- including highlighting the voices of extremism and militarism as for intervention to seem like the most moderate option, or ensuring reports on violence at the border to always reach Ankara without fail. Lines will be drawn by us for their economic woes and struggles to originate from Lebanon, and they will blindly accept the correlation.

 BRG_Keep_Them_Divided_desc:0 "공산주의는 현존하는 모든 이념중에서 가장 혐오스러운 이념이 아닐 수 없습니다. 그것은 정신적인 발암물질이며 만약 배설되지 않는다면 확산되고 또 확산되어 모든 인종의 생각을 오염시킬 전염병으로 발전할 겁니다. 다행히도 신의 섭리가 아리아 민족에게 이 불치병을 이길 낼 보호를 제공했습니다. 국가사회주의. 예. 과거 순수했던 라이히가 전 정권을 멸망시켰던 것처럼 우리가 서러시아 혁명전선을 파괴할 수 있게 해주는 것은 우리의 이념적 순결입니다.\n\n그들의 이념적 타락 다음으로 서러시아 혁명 전선의 가장 큰 약점은 끈질긴 파벌주의입니다. 주코프, 투하쳅스키, 알투닌은 세 가지 다른 종류의 공산주의 사상을 쫓고 있으며 그것이 경쟁으로 들어서는 순간, 이 국가의 모든 것을 망쳐버릴 수 있습니다. 이것은 우리가 이용할수 있는 가장 큰 약점이며 앞으로도 그렇게 될 것입니다. 우리는 그 볼셰비즘의 지도자들이 협력하지 못하도록 권력 기반을 분산시키며 내부 분쟁에 집중하게끔 상호증오의 불길을 부채질할 것입니다."
 BRG_Northern_Light_Show_desc:0 "코미 공화국은 2차대전에서 잘못된 교훈을 얻었습니다. 유럽인들은 국가사회주의의 우월성을 인정하여 서부의 진보주의자들과 동부 볼셰비키들에 대한 라이히의 승리를 대부분 수용했지만 코미의 사람들은 민주주의를 하겠다며 자신들의 공허한 공산주의 이념을 버리고 다른 시스템으로 바꾸기로 결정했었습니다. 덕분에 현재 코미는 그들이 채택한 체제의 단점만을 제대로 보여주는 고질적인 불안정과 수많은 불안에 시달리고있으며 민주주의를 유도하려는 그들의 썩어버린 노동은 우리에게 그들의 공화국에서 달콤한 결실을 수확할수 있게 해 줍니다. 뭐, 이젠 어느정도 안정화된 편이고 더이상 불협화음은 크게 남아있지 않은것 같지만 우리 요원들은 코미에 다시 대혼란을 촉발시킬 방법을 찾아낼 것입니다. 죽음이 코미의 대문을 걷어찬다면 문은 경첩이 떨어져나가 박살나겠지요."
 BRG_The_Tsar_desc:0 "서러시아는 기사단국에게 톡특한 퍼즐을 제공하고 있습니다. 우리의 목표는 두가지인데 서로 상쇄될 수 있는 것 같습니다. 우리는 러시아의 심장부의 혼돈을 모아 라이히에게 혼란을 불러일으킬수 있는 역할을 할 강력한 지역 강군을 만들어야 합니다. 이 꼭두각시는 다른 신생 러시아 국가들을 하나로 묶을 수 있을 만큼 충분히 강해야 하며, 또한 수 세대에 걸쳐 라이히의 노선을 슬라브 군단에게 저항하는데 힘을 쏟게 하여 약화시키고 결정적으로 경멸스러운 모스코비엔 국가판무관부를 박살내 종식시킬 수 있어야 합니다. 둘째로 이 신흥 강대국은 부르군트 SS 기사단국에 대한 어떠한 정보나 저항을 가지고 있지 않아야 하며 슈츠슈타펠에게 위협이 될 만한 이념적 성향을 가지고 있지 않아야 합니다.\n\n운 좋게도 두가지 기준을 모두 총족하는 후보자를 발견했습니다. 자칭 차르인 퇴위 러시아 왕정의 후손인 뱟카 군벌이 우리의 공작에 유망한 후보로 선정되었습니다. 차르는 이전에 총통에게 부역하며 자신을 볼셰비즘에 대항할수 있는 아이콘으로 사용해달라 부탁한 적이 있습니다. 이것은 이전 볼셰비키의 독일 재침공 때 러시아인들에게 확실한 효과를 나타냈습니다. 뱟카는 요즘 조금씩 성장하며 도시를 발전시키기 시작했는데 이것은 우리 요원들을 심을 수 있는 절호의 기회입니다. 첫번째 단계는 우선 단순한 영향력 수집이 될 것이지만 그들 내부에 우리 쪽 사람들을 두는 것 자체가 향후 개입에 큰 도움이 될 겁니다."
 BRG_The_Brotherhood_desc:0 "서러시아의 혼란 속에서 일어난 세력은 지구를 오염시키고 있는 아리아 민족의 모든 이념적 원수의 축소판이라고 할 수 있습니다. 지금까지 쓰여졌던 모든 신조와 마셨던 모든 독들은 가장 극단적인 형태의 자유주의적 퇴폐의 변칙에서부터 엄격한 종교적 독단주의의 영혼을 부식시키는 변칙에 이르기까지 곰의 시체 안쪽에 새겨져 있는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 공산주의자들만 조국의 적이 아닙니다. 우리가 세상을 선하고 더 올바르게 만들려면 현상태의 관료들 역시 몰살시켜야 합니다. 가장 충격적인 것은 운터멘쉬들이 감히 자신들을 국가사회주의자라고 칭하고 있다는 겁니다...\n\n 아르한겔스크와 뱟카에 이르는 여러 두드러진 강국들과는 달리 이 러시아 약소국은 우리의 목표에 크게 가치가 없습니다. 아마 전쟁이 벌어진다면 이들은 그냥 주변 강국들이 쌓게 될 시체의 산 그 이상 의미를 가지진 못할 겁니다. 그들은 가장 굴욕적인 죽음을 맞이할 자격이 있습니다. 자신의 부하들에게 죽음을 당하는 것만큼 굴욕적인 죽음이 있을까요? 이 "아리아인 형제단"은 우리 요원들이 선동한 조직적인 집단 노예 반란에 휩싸여 감히 아리아인을 참칭한 것에 대한 대가를 받게 될 겁니다. 우리 SS요원들은 밤이 되면 형제단의 도시로 잠입해 파괴하고, 도망가기보다는 싸우기를 선호하는 자들을 무장시킬 겁니다. 다시는 러시아인들이 감히 '아리아인'을 칭하지 못하게 해야지요."
 BRG_The_Samaran_Question_desc:0 "블라소프는 과거 붉은 군대의 파르티잔으로서 공산주의를 위해 러시아 제국을 전복시키는 것으로 그의 커리어를 시작했습니다. 모스크바에서 국방군에게 패한 후 그는 반역자가 되어 라이히와 연합해 총통을 위해 싸우기로 결심한 러시아인들을 이끌었습니다. 처음부터 그의 조국에 대한 충성심은 의심스러웠습니다. 그는 러시아 동부의 볼셰비키들이 무너질때까지 묵묵히 그의 임무를 수행했고 그 이후 독일 장비로 무장한 러시아 군인들을 이끌어 하나의 군벌로 변모시켰습니다. 그는 다른 사람들과 같은 운명을 맞이할 자격이 있습니다.\n\n우리 정보에 의하면 블라소프 군의 반체제 인사인 오흐탄은 쿠데타를 일으킬 준비를 하고 있는것 같습니다. 사마라 내전이 벌어진다면 우리는 그를 아낌없이 도울 것입니다. 사마라의 사람들은 그의 세력이 의아할 정도로 갑자기 커지며 블라소프의 충성파 병력들이 사라지는 것을 알게 될 겁니다. 우리가 파악한 바 오흐탄은 우리의 선물을 의도에 대한 의심없이 받아들일 바보로 판단됩니다. 곧 블라소프 장군에게 배반으로 세력을 키운 모든 자들의 운명을 보여주도록 합시다."
 BRG_The_Freikorp_desc:0 "폭격으로 파괴된 도시가 가득하고 자그만한 주들로 붕괴된 서러시아의 황폐한 초원과 불타버린 숲은 아리아 민족의 불굴의 의지에 반하는 모든 것의 정당한 운명으로서 우뚝 서 있습니다. 선조들이 이전에 슬라브인들에게 야기시킨 재앙 때문에 발생한 혼란사태로 이제 우리 기사단국이 막대한 행운을 거머쥐게 되었습니다. 없는 거나 다름없는 현지 기반시설과 부패한 관료들의 비도덕이 초래한 질서의 부재는 새로운 보병 여단이나 무기를 그 출처에 대한 의심없이 우리가 원하는 곳으로 옮길 수 있게 만들어 주었습니다. 따라서 뱟카의 지방 당국은 그들의 '사랑하는' 차르에게 충성하고 군 복무 준비가 되어 있는 전문적으로 무장하고 훈련된 군인들을 발견하게 되어 매우 기뻐할 겁니다. 물론 우리의 독일 억양에 대해 좀 조치를 취해야 하겠지만 말이죠."
 BRG_Infiltrate_The_Okhrana_desc:0 "만약 뱟카의 차르에게 복무하고 있는 군인들 중 그나마 정예라고 불리는 자들이 있다면 그건 아마 오흐라나일 겁니다. 이 호위병들은 차르의 영토에 대한 내부 질서를 유지하는 책임을 맡고 있는데 이것은 우리의 입장에서 우리의 국가가 뱟카의 정치와 군사같은 모든 면에 영향을 미칠수 있는 최고의 방법임을 의미합니다. 지금 뱟카에 존재하는 우리의 요원들은 뱟카의 모든 군인중에 가장 뛰어나기 때문에 그들이 오흐라나에 임명되는 것이 그리 어렵지 않을 것입니다. 하지만 차르의 경호원들이 그들의 새 친구를 너무 의심한다면 우리 셔츠 주머니에 넣어준 중요한 물건 몇 개가 그걸 보증하기에 충분하고도 남을 것입니다. 고대 로마의 프라이토리아니들이 로마의 정치에 큰 영향을 미쳤듯이 우리의 통제 하에 있는 오흐라나 또한 러시아 차르주의자들의 정치에 중대한 영향을 미칠 수 있게 될 것입니다."
 BRG_Wo_alle_strasen_enden_desc:0 "뱟카의 차르에 대한 모든 준비가 끝났습니다. 우리는 그가 그의 국가를 확장하고 러시아 전쟁을 준비하는 동안 우리가 할 수 있는 모든 것을 다했습니다. 차르는 모르고 있지만 그는 우리의 도움 없이는 그렇게 유능한 채로 존재할 수 없었을 겁니다. 심지어 그의 안전을 책임지는 가장 가까운 사람들조차 우리 손 안에 있습니다. 우리의 모든 작품들은 뱟카가 서러시아의 운터멘쉬들을 없애기 위해, 그리고 우리 조국 옆에 존재하는 슈츠슈타펠의 적들을 무찌를수 있게 할 장기말일 뿐입니다. 차르는 우리의 의도에 따라 꼭두각시처럼 제국을 운영할 것이며 SS국가지도자 각하의 적들은 그들이 받아들여할 운명을 맞이할 것입니다. 이 러시아를 다시 제국으로 만드는데 수십만의 슬라브인들이 죽어야 한다면 그것도 좋은 일입니다. 어차피 세상은 그들이 많아지는것을 바라지 않으니까요."

 BRG_globalplan_puma_decisions_desc:0 "세계계획 퓨마 is the long-awaited strike against the pathetic Bourgeois-Jewish-Capitalist cowards within the United State, who have so long sought to inhibit the true capabilities of the Aryan race. By funneling supplies to the radical groups on the left and right alike, infiltrating all sectors of American society, and building a network of connections able to further the will of the Reichsfurher, we will at last bring the American "giant" to its knees. By the order of the Reichsfurher-SS, the exploitation and sabotage of the New World's vast array of resources is of highest priority. Success in this area will allow the Plan to advance to completion, ushering the final triumph of the Aryan, and a glorious new age worthy of his true capabilities."

However, that relies on two things: the ability to construct plenty of atomic bombs, and other nations lacking that capability. A few well-placed saboteurs in the American Department of Defense, plus some discreet advisors to other nations, would do well to keeping the Reichsführer-SS's vision unimpeded."

The Reichsführer may have been unable to save the Führer at the time, but he still learned much from his examples. You must appeal to the people directly to bypass the alluring madness of the Red Hydra. The Glenn administration is speaking of reducing their nuclear arsenal, to save money for his Bukharinite social programs. Surely the people won't accept this insanity from the R-D's, even if they are degenerates. We must immediately redeploy our agents to manage propaganda campaigns denouncing this open invitation to Japanese invasion.

Yeah, sure, the Jews were ruining the country, but his black coworkers in the FBI were not monsters like the Klan Master was making them out to be. Edward exhaled audibly as he walked from the small forest clearing to his truck. He pulled out a cigarette and lit it, then reached for his keys. A sudden gust of wind knocked the cigarette out of his mouth. "Fuck." he swore in the darkness. "Need another, friend?" a voice asked.\n\nEdward turned around, and before him stood a slender man, holding out a pack of smokes. "Thanks." Edward said. The man nodded, popped out his own lighter, and lit Edwards smoke.\n\n"That was... something." The man began. "You're Edward, right?"\n\n"Yeah..." Edward replied. He took a step back, alarm bells ringing in his head. How the hell did he know his name? "Who are you?"\n\n"Oh, me?" The man laughed. "Derik. We went to middle school together." Edward nodded. "Nice talking to you, Derik." He jumped into his pickup and turned the ignition. Nothing. Fuck.\n\nHe tried to start the engine three more times before giving up. God damnit. The mortgage was due, no food in the house, and now the truck was dead. "Fuck!" He jumped out and kicked the truck. The other man; Derik, watched silently. Then, "Rough night?"\n\nEdward sighed. "Long month. God dammit man, when it rains, it pours." Derik nodded his head in understanding. "Need a ride? I'm going to the bar, but I'm more than happy to drop you off, or you can even come along if you want. You sure seem like you could use a beer. First one will even be on me." Derik winked."

It was easy to preach that Jews and blacks were bad, but why? And every question that Dawson thought up, thought that would trip up the self-assured supremest was always met by a reasonable, logical answer.\n\n"... and so, that is the White Man's burden. We spread across these great plains, and brought civilization and greatness from sea to shining sea." His face glowed as laughter filled the bar. Although both weren't official Klansmen, any white man who knew of their struggle was welcome in the White Knight's barroom. "But those goddamn liberals would see all of our work thrown away." His face dropped. He sipped his beer, then leaned back into his chair.\n\n"But surely, your work with the Yockies, organizing and all that... uh, stuff. It's making a difference!" Edward exclaimed. Derik sighed.\n\n"It's not enough my friend. It's never enough. The whole country is against us. The Jews have almost won, its nearly too late already." He sipped his beer. "The Federal Government puts us down, community leaders hate our message, hell, even you work against us." Derik pointed at Dawson. "The FBI loves to terrorize and spy on us. What can we do?"

It was modified, of course, to look like Hoover was having an intimate moment with his assistant director, Clyde Tolson. Up close, Edward noticed the blemishes of Tolson's cheeks, the wrinkled, washed out hands of Hoover, and some minor distortions and artifacts from the manipulation process.

Andre grabbed a stapled, crumpled, and damp-smelling letter. The letter was a great example of the most common piece of writing sent to RFK: A man from Georgia explains in a five page long essay that the "...institution of segregation will remain eternal in the American Deep South." The audacity and stunning conviction of that made Andre think that no possible letter could be worth sending to the President. Moments after picking up another letter, he changed his mind. A letter from a young girl attending Harvard, RFK's alamater, expressing her positive opinions on his policies regarding civil rights.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the President opened up the new re-packaged letter, to read about a young girl's message to the President.

But it exists only on paper. Every so-called ringleader is a Gestapo double agent, every meeting room is bugged, and every recruited member is doomed. Its structure is ingeniously designed to root out subversives: a potential recruit is identified and approached by a Gestapo agent posing as a Brotherhood recruiter. They are brought to several meetings, and asked to do minor tasks to prove their loyalty: for example, stealing a crate of rifles from an (already-alterted) garrison. With their loyalty proven, they are asked to bring one or two trusted accomplices with them to the next meeting. There, they are all arrested and processed by the Gestapo.\n\nThe most challenging part of this plan will be building the reputation of this false organization. Underplay it in the media, and people will not hear of it; overplay it, and people will doubt the Ordensstaat's power. It will take careful planning by Office VII's propaganda wing in order to create the illusion that the group is expanding organically while still maintaining that the RHSA is adequate in fighting the threat, but we are confident that they can pull it off."

Over the past several weeks, hundreds of Frenchmen and Belgians, plus the occasional German whose mind had been polluted with ideals like democracy and universal equality, took the bait and walked right into the waiting arms of Gestapo squadrons. Even better, the flow does not seem to be tapering off. Although the numbers will eventually decline when would-be resistance members start to wise up and no longer fall for it, we hope to round up at least a couple thousand by the time the program is completed. And even though the numbers may be relatively small, there is a far more important aspect: deterrence.

Although the Sicherheitsdienst already had many plainclothes informants, they mostly focused on the population of German settlers and native collaborators.

The results of the latest programs have proven that their ideas were ill-founded, and hundreds of would-be rebels have already been arrested for discussing subversive ideas in places they thought they would not be heard. We expect that the numbers will eventually taper off as subversives learn to clam up, we hope to round up at least a couple thousand by the time the program is completed.

The Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo have been mobilized to reduce this threat, carefully peering into the lives of every Breton or Dutch collaborator who resides within the Ordensstaat. Their findings were, to say the least, enlightening.\n\nIt seems that the Breton economy is almost entirely reliant on smuggling, and transporting illicit goods impossible to find within the Reich to the more materialistic residents of the Ordensstaat is their specialty. American cigarettes, Italian wines, and Brazilian bananas seem to be their most popular brands. A few summary public executions of smugglers and purchasers, combined with a more aggressive beach-combing operation along the shoreline to find light boats with contraband, should be enough to deal with the problem in the meantime.\n\nAs for the Dutch, it seems that most of their involvement is radical pan-nationalists seeking to incite dissent among the Flemish communities of the Ordensstaat. Although we cannot act with impunity against them-many are diplomats and civil servants, and both RK-Niederlande and the Ordensstaat are de jure regions of the Reich-that is not to say that they will be safe from any unfortunate accidents."

While it would be enough to stop a couple automobiles trying to rush over the border, it would be utterly useless against an enemy with any armor or weaponry stronger than small arms.\n\nThe other model, however, showed something quite different. Where there were once trees was now a clear-cut field with a 12-foot-tall electric fence running through it. The road was flanked by trenches and pillboxes, with miniature machine guns poking out of them. There were caches of concrete barriers, sandbags, caltrops, dragon's teeth, and even a couple artillery pieces—enough to stop anything up to and including a panzer. The garrison was now large enough to house dozens of soldiers, who could hold the fort against a far larger force for days on end until reinforced by an army coming from the interior.

This is certainly true of its most recent incarnation, as a patchwork of two governments united only by the desire to hold off the influence of the Reich.  But it has been this way for a very long time.  The peninsula has never known Aryan rule, having been settled by lesser peoples of southern Europe.  Greeks, Phoenicians, Lusitanians, and more.  All of these peoples became a stew of new languages and nations, from the savage Moors to the bizarre Basques.  And this is to say nothing of their centuries of vile Jewish influence.  Altogether, Iberia is a patchwork of inferior peoples that should never have become one unified power.  But this is also an opportunity for us.  Many of these peoples-Basque, Catalan, Asturian, Galician-seek independence from the central government.  Moreover, the Iberian state occupies a unique position on the world stage.  Its economy has been wrecked by the Gibraltar Dam, but it also finds itself in control of the thing.  It has a sizable overseas colonial empire.  In short, there is a great deal of room to further our ambitions through the strange, impure amalgamation that is the Iberian Union."

Its location at the gate to the Mediterranean and the European continent makes the prize of a friendly Iberian polity too valuable for the great powers to resist interfering in the conflict, and tensions are sure to escalate across the globe as they find themselves backing rival factions.\n\nThere is much work to be done. Plans must be adapted, and new ones made. Assets must be activated and put to work.

It seems the only ones the whole peninsula can agree to loathe are the natives in their colonies and the concept of competent government. Without the strong state seen in our Ordensstaat, Iberia fumbles in the dark, always at the brink of immeasurable violence.\n\nLike a house of cards, all we need is one little push on the right card, and it will all come crumbling down.

Not every faction can be as willingly subverted as our friends the Asturians, but that can easily be remedied using our strategically placed insiders. False information about another political faction making it seem the weapons come from us here, a bit of propaganda there, and maybe some slight application of bribery, blackmail and political smearing where necessary. \n\nIf we can continue to successfully wrangle the separatists using our insiders, it may be time to begin considering withdrawing some of our German agents from Iberia, to lessen the risk of detection."

With Salazar holding the reins of power, Iberia would stagnate, more obsessed with retaining old glories than building a state for the modern world.  More importantly, it would be a state that crosses lines in order to achieve dominance over new parts of the globe.  In Algeria, especially, Salazar's Iberia would push its luck, perhaps too far.

The Ordensstaat will supply these groups with all the guns they could ever need.  In return, the profits from this arms smuggling will bring liquid capital back to the Ordensstaat.

They must be weakened, by any means possible, so that they can eventually be killed to a man. It is understated to say that every moment the world continues to tolerate their existence is an affront to civilization and to humanity.\n\nSecondarily, it is incumbent upon us to select among the other warlords one who is most useful to us as a counterweight in the east against our rivals, and to do what we can to either turn the others to his side or else see to their collective ruin. One candidate looks particularly promising, and has even rendered aid upon our Führer once before: the warlord of Vyatka, a man who would style himself an emperor, and would surely not rebuff our assistance in reclaiming his birthright.

Someone back in Paris had picked them for him, just like they had picked his background. He was a river merchant, from a farm village outside Murygino. He had three children: two daughters living with his wife, and a son that died in the war. Which war he died in, and fighting which enemy, depended on who he was speaking to at the time. His identity was eminently plausible, both common and dreary enough to not inspire much questioning. He'd never gotten accustomed to living as 'Simeon', though. Russia was too hostile and alien for him to ever feel at ease here. He mostly stayed by himself ever since arriving, and every time he had to talk to someone—like today—all he had on his mind was the need not to give himself away.\n\nConstruction was underway in Vyatka. An impressive looking port facility was being built along the river, at the behest of the local Tsar. Rumour abound of a plan by the Tsar to earn himself a war chest manufacturing vodka, and it was just that sort of rumour that 'Simeon' was eager to exploit. A medium sized bribe was enough for him to be sat in an office opposite the Crown Representative to the port, discussing a trade agreement Simeon was sure would be too enticing for the bureaucrat to resist. His ships would sail into Vyatka to unload potatoes collected from farm towns connected to the river, and on their way out of the city again, those same crates would be filled with bottles of the Tsar's vodka. Of course, the potato crates would hide secret compartments hiding bullets and disassembled rifles, and many of Simeon's crew were secretly more SS agents. The port bureaucrat didn't need to know that, though. All he needed to see was a friendly smile from a local merchant, eager to make a profit for himself and his Tsar."

They each had their own tale to spin about why and how they arrived here, some talking of famine and others explaining away their peculiar manner of speaking with stories about their far away origins.

From there, they produced an extremely efficient printing and inking complex, producing hundreds of propaganda posters a day advertising the campaigns of extremist political parties in the so-called 'Komi Republic'. Decrying the dangers of imminent onslaught from the likes of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the posters depict a Komi Republic on the precipice of destruction, the Red Army about to arrive and crush all of the republic's citizens beneath its boot.

Oktan rightfully views Vlasov as a submissive underling to the Reich, a man who betrayed his own people to serve a foreign power, and is justly hated for it by all men from Samara to Arkhangelsk. Oktan has his own ambitions, and leads a troupe of Vlasov's high ranking subordinates who wish to see the traitor warlord replaced. They have their own silly beliefs about what will happen afterwards, imagining that Oktan can lead Russia to find greatness, but their sad delusions are not of any concern to us. All that matters to the Reichsführer-SS is seeing Vlasov's head on a pike, and Oktan can deliver that.

Now we can bring Operation Black Bear -- to undermine the stability of the "democratic" Russian states and help push the Slavic people as a whole into another war with the Reich. As is the path set out by our glorious Reichsfurher-SS, we will set the inferiors against each other, until in their weakness and stupidity they plunge headlong into the great global cleansing, from which the new Aryan order will arise."

BRG.5014.t:0 "A Meeting at Midnight"
BRG.5014.d:0 "There was a stillness on the river Ob that night. A sense of emptiness, a hunger. It was as if every plant and animal was holding their breath. There was no moon in the sky. The stars were concealed behind clouds. There was only blackness. Gaping, yawning, waiting. \n\nAnd then, just past midnight, a man stepped into the clearing. He looked up at the empty sky, down at the cold dark water, and then intently at the path from which he had come. He too was silent. He too was waiting. \n\nNot much later, a second man arrived. The two men glanced at each other, and without speaking drew small coins from hidden pockets. Twin runes were set on the silver, barely visible amidst the darkness. \n\nThe first man was a river-trader, a well known pillar of the community in Vyatka. He was known to give alms to the beggars and candy to the children. The second was a printer from Komi. He was a recluse, but would sometimes come to gatherings. When he did, it was a cause for great celebration, as he told stories of enemies near and far, battles one and battles lost, of heroism and tragedy. \n\nThey were agents of the SD division of the SS-Burgundy. They had one purpose: to unleash chaos and cruelty among the Russian lands, and so further the higher purposes of the Reichsfurher-SS.\n\nThe Agents spoke quietly, quickly, and with as few words as possible. Their work in the west was done, it was time to bring the rightful punishment of the Untermensch to Siberia, and move Operation Bar one step closer to completion."

 BRG.5015.t:0 "A New Arrival"
 BRG.5015.d:0 "There were many empty houses in the city of Orenburg. More often than not the refugees had brought large families that preferred safety in numbers, and the city had lost many of its residents in the wars and raids. The residents of the "Vienna of the Urals" had grown used to the derelict buildings, and were thus rather surprised when overnight one of the hovels transformed into a thriving business. \n\nA new printmaker had arrived, moved in from Komi. He was a genial fellow, who preferred to speak as little as possible of his business and much more about the hectic politics of the Russian wastes. It was unclear who exactly used his business, but they surely seemed to be generous as the presses were turning day and night. In time, the townsfolk grew used to their new neighbor, and ceased to wonder about such things. After all, they were just suddenly realizing the grave danger their precious city state was in, as the great warlords to the east and west alike hovered predatorily overhead. The other nearby principalities were experiencing a similar burst of suspicion and fear, and old wounds and grievances between the Ural states soon resurfaced. \n\nEach passing day seemed to bring another wild rumor of the cruelties and madness of enemies near and far, spurred on, just maybe, by the extraordinarily well-designed fear-mongering posters that had sprouted on every corner. Meanwhile, the printshop stayed lit and humming well into the night, as Orenburg's newest citizen told his stories and performed his dark work."

However, it seems that this understandable impulse has escalated into a full blown plague of disillusionment and rebellion. Everywhere the public heaps scorn on our government. Old women spit on our soldiers. Little boys throw rocks at the heads of our magistrates. Unless we do something soon, our control over West Siberia might well be short lived."

 BRG.5017.d:0 "It was midnight, the ground around the arms depot was shiny with frost, reflecting the stars above. Despite the chill, the soldiers were drowsy from a long day of training, and all but asleep on their feet. Suddenly from within the main storage building, there came a colossal explosion. The guards were thrown forward, and though they survived with only minor injuries, they could only watch helplessly as a great portion of our arms stockpile went up in smoke. This is but one of many incidents seemingly aimed at sabotaging our ability to wage war, and no doubt the fault of those two-faced traitors in West Russia."

 BRG.5018.d:0 "Mikhail underlined the number at the end of his ledger. Excellent, another node on his expanding network of river traders had begun turning a healthy profit. Leaning back in the leather chair he had recently set up in his warehouse, he lit a cigar. The real Cuban stuff; the shipping cost alone to get this in via Finland and downriver to Vyatka meant the box had cost him the same as a pre-war car would have. But some luxuries a man of his wealth co- \n\n"Numbers are looking good, I see?"\n\nMikhail's instincts from a war long ago and decades working in one of the most dangerous professions in the Russian Anarchy kicked in the second the German-accented voice floated out of the dark of the warehouse. His hand found the lovingly maintained Tokarev hidden under the armrest of his chair, and within seconds he had adopted a standing firing stance. When he saw the figure emerge out of the dark, he however lowered his weapon. "Werner? You mad bastard, I almost shot you! What are you doing in Vyatka? I've never seen you east of Kostroma!"\n\nThe pale, skeletally thin Volga German held up a cigarette, and Werner lit it with his cigar. "You are one to speak about where I should and should not appear, Mikhail. You know as well as I do that we rarely had to meet because of our man in Komi. Without him, I sometimes have to make these trips myself, as do you."\n\nHe took a deep inhale of the cigarette. "But enough about old times. I see you have made quite the name for yourself, you are trading all over West Russia now. This is good, your services will be needed if your... beloved tsar is to hold onto his realm."\n\nMikhail grinned; Werner's mysterious friend in Moskowien had always been his best customers.

That was the last one, now nobody who knew his face still drew breath. A shame he had been forced to neutralize such good friends and long-term business partners, but at the end of the day they were untermensch and he was an übermensch, there could never be permanent friendship between them in the eternal struggle of the races.\n\nThe pale Volga German turned to the Russian's safe, the one the trader had unlocked a thousand times in his presence. What idiots these Slavs were, no surprise the Old Führer had declared they should be scoured from the Earth with the other unworthy.\n\nHaving stuffed his suitcase with the Russian's collection of Reichsmarks, Werner hurried to the docks. All around him the city was abuzz with war preparations, he saw marching columns, propaganda posters and worried citizens discussing a return to rationing. The time was almost nigh, and Werner smiled.\n\nAs he entered the riverboat headed down the Volga-Kama network once plowed by Werner's smugglers, he noted the crew. Six of them, four passengers. One weapon, a rifle. Captain probably had a pistol too. Pathetic. Back in the day no riverboat would travel without an armed contingent. Sign of New Russia indeed. Oh well, should be a simple enough business taking them down once they approached Moskowien. It was time to go "home," finally see that supposed paradise his fellow SS men and the Reichsführer had created in Burgund. He raised his hat to the city behind him, whispering his goodbye so the crew would not hear him."

 BRG_wolf.1.desc:0 "The tentacles of the Ordensstaat stretch further and further across the globe, snatching up new tools for the plan of the Reichsfurher-SS. Globalplan Wolf focuses on one of the juciest prizes of all -- the Middle East. Already our agents have infiltrated the region, and now work to disturb the colonial order, wrecking havoc on global tensions and the supply of oil. Our short term focus is on excerbating tensions between the triumvirate rivals Italy and Turkey in Syria. A confrontation there would go a long way to unleashing a beautiful cycle of violence. In the longer term, we hope to make use of the gluttony and cowardice of the Egyptian King Farouk. In time, as our agents proliferate, we may consider even loftier plans."
 BRG_wolf.1.a:0 "A place of oppurtunities."

 BRG_wolf.2.t:0 "The Kings Folly"
 BRG_wolf.2.desc:0 "It is so convenient, that although we are certainly happy to help them on their way, the untermensch are often willing to be the agents of their own demise. In Egypt, the pathetic King Farouk is well known for his lust, luxorious tastes, and disdain for his people. Our agents are already well placed to lead the King to ever more exorbitant states, wrecking havoc on his nations economy and unleashing chaos throughout the region."
 BRG_wolf.2.a:0 "And his nation will bleed."

 BRG_wolf.3.t:0 "Laying the Bait"
 BRG_wolf.3.desc:0 "In the distant Southern Deserts of the Kingdom of Egypt, the nomads wandered miserably, looking for some humble hovel to spend the night. In the many farming settlements along the Nile, the peasants worked day and night for the chance to live another year, a future for their family, and maybe a small bottle of liquor to drain their sorrows. In the narrow streets of Cairo, the cityfolk begged and stole for a living, crouching in crumbling apartments devoid of light or water, despite the promises of the government that infrastructure improvements would be coming "soon".\n\nIn the palaces of King Farouk, it was party time. Exotic dancers from across the world gyrated on poles of solid gold, whole platters of caviar were passed around hors d'oeuvres, decorated cloth bags full of Cocaine were handed out as favors. The palace was always glowing with light, thundering with muscid, and reeking of the alcoholic excess within.\n\nFarouk was never one to be surpassed, and he out-drank the hardest German beer merchants and proprietors of Mexican tequila alike, he out-snorted even the most outrageous coke-addicts, and he ate more than a dozen portly British prostitutes combined.\n\nAround the king were clustered his closest friends and dearest enablers. For every line, bottle, and plate he consumed, they pressed two more in his hands. Despite their saccharine good cheer, they did not touch the delicacies themselves -- for they were true Aryans after all. This was merely another play in the game, one that would earn them profit in smuggling money yes, but more importantly one that would bankrupt the Egyptian government and bring the whole rotten untermensch edifice crashing to the ground."
 BRG_wolf.3.a:0 "The Third Circle awaits."

 BRG_wolf.5.t:0 "The East Aflame"
 BRG_wolf.5.desc:0 "Since the first untermensch crawled out of the slime to drag the Aryan down, the Middle East has been the focal point of global conflict. Never has there been a great power that did not seek to dominate this region's resources and strategic position -- the land of black gold, the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa, the birthplace of modern religion.\n\nNow once again the region is aflame with a three way proxy conflict between the Saudis and their puppets in the Muslim Brotherhood, the Arab Nationalist Baathists, and the remnants of Italian colonialism. Each of these factions is backed by one global power or another, all are heavily armed, and thanks to our help, at the point of war. Now is the time for us to begin a general process of turning the cold war hot, and bringing an end to the long era of weakness and Aryan servitude."
 BRG_wolf.5.a:0 "The land of oppurtunity."

 BRG_wolf.6.t:0 "A Favorable Outcome"
 BRG_wolf.6.desc:0 "Once more the Ordensstaat's subtle use of lesser factions has paid off. The winner of the Iranian civil war is permeated by our agents, and indebted to our influence. In hidden places throughout the Persian mountains, our bases pump out propaganda, weapons, and recruitment. Now with a stronghold near the current focal point of global tensions, we have the ability to exacerbate the ongoing oil crisis and support the faction most amenable to our interests. Soon the great powers of the world will be drawn into an unescapable conflict over black gold, one from which they are unlikely to walk away."

It would be most opportune to begin our newly drafted potential operations in the Italian menace as pertinently as possible. \n\nWith all respect and honor,\n\nSS-Obergruppenführer Heinrich Müller"

 BRG_wolf.8.desc:0 "To the Knight of the Ordensstaat, the Reichsführer-SS: \n\nThe time has come, once more, to look towards the continuous failures and opportunities for exploitation within the most despicable traitors along the Italian Peninsula. Our current intelligence reports indicate the massive conflicts exploding out from the Middle East has caused extreme plummets in stock investments towards "Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi," the most powerful Italian oil company and, in turn, the top provider of international oil across the world.

 BRG_wolf.100.t:0 "Growing Corruption"
 BRG_wolf.100.desc:0 "For a state such as ours, free from the cowardice and petty "democracy" of years past, corruption should be but a shadow of itself, and yet we seem to be unable to ever cleanse ourselves of it entirely. This has recently been especially true in our Middle Eastern Arab-Majority territories, where there has been a dramatic increase in embezzlement and bribe taking. It seems that nearly every low-level official has been implicated in some way, and several mid-tier beuracrauts as well. Although the highest echelons of our administration appears as surprised by this turn of events as we are, we must act quickly lest our hold over the region be rotted out from within."
 BRG_wolf.100.a:0 "Start clearing out the rot."

 BRG_wolf.101.t:0 "Terrorist Attack"
 BRG_wolf.101.desc:0 "It seems that there is no end to our troubles in the IME. No matter how many resources we throw at the region, it seems that every month brings some new terrorist attack or urban uprising. This time it was one of the former, a carefully coordinated series of explosions that killed a number of Italian soldiers and administrators, along with a heavy civilian toll. Although many different groups have claimed responsibility, the most likely true culprit is undoubtedly the Turks. In time perhaps we will be able to bring justice to these fools and sabotours, but for the mment the only thing to do is rebuild."
 BRG_wolf.101.a:0 "Damn the Turks."

 BRG_wolf.102.t:0 "Foreign Support"
 BRG_wolf.102.desc:0 "It is rare that we receive good news from the Levantine region, where every day seems to bring news of new troubles among the locals and sabre-rattling from our enemies. However, our troops have recently received an enormous shipment of weapons and equipment from allies “sympathetic” to our cause. Although the weapons are unmarked and untraceable, and there is no way to confirm the veracity of this claim, they are also of high quality deep necessity. Whoever this mysterious benefactor is, we will be greatly indebted to them should the growing tensions in the region boil over into open conflict."

"Dedicated and disciplined, curious, yet intriguing." the Führer pondered, as he approached the Commanding Officer of the Freikorps units. "Oberstleutnant Käufer, I have been told? You and your men shall be greatly rewarded for your service towards the true patriots of the German Reich and the rightful heir to become the Führer. I must ask, of course: where is it that you and your men hail from?" \n\nA tense moment of silence adorned the conversation beyond the smiles, as the Oberstleutnant's bright eyes locked with Göring's pale, steely eyes. "Stuttgart, my Führer." the Commanding Officer stated as he offered the Führer a salute.
