 BRG_collapse.100.desc:0 "It is the nature of the subhuman to creep through the cracks and leak into the golden genetic line of the supreme Aryan warriors who make up the truly worthy population of this Earth. However, no matter how worthy they may be, the disgusting tendrils of corruption have always been a great source of destruction for the Aryan. Once more, we find ourselves facing this destruction again.\n\nDeep within the heartlands of former French territory, where the most corrupt and degenerate culture to ever have the unfortunate chance to rot this world, has taken the sanctity of another group, in stoking the flames of treason throughout the land as so many claim independence and wage war against their rightful lords in the Ordensstaat. Our own units within the Schutzstaffel have decided to defy the orders of their superiors in the Ordensstaat, and proclaim themselves as some abominable form of independent from our command. Whether it be from starvation, degenerative brainwashing, or some other foulness upon the world, these men have defied the Reichsführer-SS; therefore, they must pay the price for their defiance.\n\nAlready, the soldiers of our forces have mustered in preparation to wage glorious war against the defiant. If the defiant rebellion seeks to insult the Aryan way of life like this, then they shall be exterminated alongside the rest."
 BRG_collapse.100.a:0 "Birds of a feather..."
 BRG_collapse.101.t:0 "REPORT: Indicators of Imminent Collapse"
 BRG_collapse.101.desc:0 "FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY TO THE REICHSFÜHRER-SS \n\nSUB: INDICATORS OF IMMINENT STATE COLLAPSE \n\nSUMMARY: Over the past several weeks, there have been a significant number of signs and indications that the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is facing an immediate state collapse and centralized control is on the verge of being lost. \n\nThere are multiple SS Legions who are acting independently of orders from Ost-Paris and other centralized SS command nodes. It is unclear if they are acting on their own, or from other traitorous officers. The capability of internal security is dismal, and they are incapable of investigating and clamping down on these treasonous activities. \n\nPartisan attacks and movements are continuing to take place, with insufficient security to prevent theft, exfiltrations, sabotage, and terrorism. The Red Poppy movement, dominated by French partisans, is taking advantage of the poor security to advance their own objectives, which include the destruction of the Ordensstaat and the expulsion of all Germans from former French territory. \n\nOur border security has similarly declined as the overall situation has deteriorated, and there are almost certainly foreign agents operating in the Ordensstaat, potentially fueling insurrectionist and resistance movements. We have insufficient resources to deal with them. \n\nIt is estimated that if drastic actions are not taken within thirty days, this trend will become irreversible. It is recommended that the security situation be rectified immediately. \n\nHEIL HIMMLER"
 BRG_collapse.101.a:0 "One chance left."
 BRG_collapse.102.t:0 "The Final Pages"
 BRG_collapse.102.desc:0 "Despite everything, Heinrich Himmler was still there.\n\nDespite the overwhelming chaos that had enveloped the Ordensstaat, the Reichsführer-SS himself was still standing among the ruins. What ruins they were, however! The ruins of a project, the ruins of a people, the ruins of a dream; they were his ruins, and yet he was the only one that could be blamed for them. And now, what could he do? Everything had come tumbling down around him, and the Aryan utopia he so-cherished now stood as a pile of rubble, infested by rebellious legions out to get him. Yes, for the first time since many years, Heinrich Himmler was afraid.\n\nAll was not lost, however: surely, there was a way to start again, maybe somewhere else! Surely, the good people of Germany were waiting for him to come back, and would welcome him with open arms as he'd shun the traitors to the fatherland. After all, the German people loved him, back then, and that was probably still the case, wasn't it? Yes, there had to be a way to begin again, he thought as he looked onto a nearby burning house. There had to be a way he could begin again in some other place, where he would have a clean slate to recreate his Aryan utopia anew, free of all the imperfections that had plagued the Ordensstaat. Or was it?\n\nNo, all of this was fantasy. Mere, pure, unabashed fantasy, created by a man who finally and at last realized the closeness of his impending death. Heinrich Himmler, the great Reichsführer-SS and champion of the Aryan race, was going to die, and such a fact had become a matter of when rather than if. He could try to run, yes, and he would try to run; but that wouldn't negate the fact that trying to save his own skin was at best a desperate endeavor. And now, only time would tell when the end would come."

 BRG_collapse.103.desc:0 "Heinrich Himmler had failed. He had, for lack of a better word, monumentally failed.\n\nSuch was one of the only observations he could make, as his bunker was on the edge of being breached. Whoever was behind the soon-to-be-opened doors did not concern him too much: whether it was Walloon or Charlemagne, they were all traitors to him, and it didn't matter much who fired the bullets, for the end result would still be the same. And yet, as the world crumbled around him, he could only feel regret, and hate; regret for not having accomplished more, and hate at himself for letting it all fall.\n\nAfter all, he was the one who allowed the Burgundian project to end up like this. It wasn't Pohl, or Ribbentrop, or any of the million yes-men he had executed during all these years; no; the only culprit here was himself, and all the doubt and hate he had accumulated through the year was finally reaching a boiling point. The situation was adamant: the Ordensstaat-Burgund, the last hope of the Aryan race, was collapsing before his very eyes, and he was the one to blame for it. And now, he was gonna die any minute now and, yet again, all because of himself. Yes, all of his enterprises had thoroughly failed, and all that remained was now a sad, pathetic man, alone in his own decrepit bunker, waiting to be shot like a dog.\n\nAs the doors of the bunker loudly opened, and as soldiers swarmed inside like flies, it was over. Himmler tried to run for safety, but there was nowhere left to go; and when a bullet shot by one of the numerous traitors went straight through his heart, his last thoughts were of Germany, and of how he had failed Her, as he collapsed on the ground."

It was this same arrogance that led the Reichsführer-SS and his closest advisors to assume that surely the French legions would not dare to use weapons of mass destruction against their German foes. After all, they were at their core cowardly and degenerate, and thus incapable of matching the will of the Aryan.\n\nBut the French SS legions had been for so long subsumed in the madness and hunger of the Ordensstaat that they had taken its ideology and made it their own.

Their purpose has been obviated; there is no longer anywhere for Ost-Paris' degenerates to run.\n\nAs ever, only service and death awaits those beneath our gaze."

  BRG_globalplan_elefant:0 "Globalplan Elefant"
  BRG_globalplan_elefant_desc:0 "With the situation in the Ordensstaat now confidently secure, we need not concern ourselves with the fate of our base. Now is the time to look outwards. Although the late Führer endured beyond his mishap with our agent, he was not long for this world. Ever since his fateful end, the world has fallen to chaos and anarchy. In this anarchy lies our future.\n\nThe Dark Continent is aflame, as our allies are helplessly locked into a costly yet tame conflict with the Americans, doing battle over the future of those far-flung lands. Perhaps if the right dominoes are felled, then this conflict could escalate into much more than just a battle between pawns upon the global chess board."

  BRG_sowing_the_seeds_of_discontent:0 "Sowing The Seeds Of Discontent"
  BRG_sowing_the_seeds_of_discontent_desc:0 "If The United States of America is a giant, then it is the most frail giant to ever have been born from the annals of history. In America, they say that their nation stands as a bastion of "liberty" and "freedom". Never before has weakness been so thinly veiled, for the nation is ruled by naught more than a cabal of Jews and delinquents who use their thin veil to milk the placated populace dry, as they seek to once again spread their shadow across the globe.\n\nThe weakness of the American nation can, however, be exploited. We shall mobilize our vast subversive resources to the United States, from where they'll begin their campaign to expose the wicked war of subjugation that their government fights in Africa. The American people have already sown the seeds, all we must do is water the plant and allow it to blossom into a beautiful display of discontent and unrest within the United States."

  BRG_growing_the_chaos:0 "Growing The Chaos"
  BRG_growing_the_chaos_desc:0 "Although the South Africans are not upon our "side" of the war in Africa, they are no good as a foe if they are defeated, and all efforts thus far undertaken by the Ordensstaat will have been for naught should Cape Town fall too easily. The dominoes simply cannot fall should they be stopped short by a premature South African surrender.\n\nThe temporary remedy to this is simple. We shall ensure that they are granted the means to continue their little struggle, so that we may continue setting the stage for a much more exciting act. The South Africans surely won't question whether they should have received any extra deliveries of "American" armaments."

  BRG_cutting_the_cords:0 "Cutting The Cords"
  BRG_cutting_the_cords_desc:0 "Whilst Hüttig and his Afrikan SS believe themselves to be the exemplars of guerilla warfare, succeeding in bogging down the tides of the South African War, they do not possess the unleashed freedom nor the resources required to cause true guerilla terror upon the African fronts.\n\nWe need only cut some of the strings which encumber our puppets in Africa, and grant them our remaining munitions and equipment so that they may be orchestrated to conduct true attacks of terror. No road shall be safe, and no bridge shall remain intact, as every step taken further into the heart of Africa shall become an ever more treacherous one."

  BRG_schencks_empty_tanks:0 "Schenck's Empty Tanks"
  BRG_schencks_empty_tanks_desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck and his Luftwaffe are a terror in the South African skies. There are few places of respite for one to flee the Südwestafrikan birds of prey. And this is precisely the issue. For every day the Luftwaffe dominates the skies of Africa, the road to Cape Town is opened to the Schild ever slightly more. We must buffer the Südwestafrkan air superiority so that the OFN may continue to fight and prolong the war for many more months to come.\n\nTo delay the Südwestafrikan aerial efforts, all we must do is ensure their aircraft face a sudden shortage of fuel. Achieving this will be simple. A few crucial oil shipments will be tragically sunk, as several vital oil and fuel lines become the target of "American sabotage". Not many aircraft engines will be spooling up upon Angolan and Namibian airstrips in coming days."

  BRG_mullers_broken_supply:0 "Müller's Broken Roads"
  BRG_mullers_broken_supply_desc:0 "The forces of the Zentralafrikan Reichskommissariat, despite being possibly the largest force among the Afrika-Schild, also faces the largest difficulties in participating in the war effort. Logistical challenges which cannot be facilitated by their partners in Ostafrika and Südwestafrika must be undertaken directly by them. Such logistical networks, which traverse half of the African continent, are rather fragile.\n\nWe need only block a few roads, detonate a few bridges, and devastate the Zentralafrikan canals, and their entire confused logistical structure will come to a grinding halt, forcing the entire Schild advance upon South Africa to screech to a near standstill."

  BRG_elefant_the_final_moves:0 "The Final Moves"
  BRG_elefant_the_final_moves_desc:0 "In every game of chess, there must be a conclusion. As the pieces are knocked down, and the pawns run thin, the King knows that it must make a decisive move for victory, else the King shall join the fallen pawns. Similarly, all wars must end. As men die and resources are expended, even the greatest of conquerors grow tired of combat.\n\nThe South African War winds down, and a conclusion is inevitable. Yet there are still measures to be taken to ensure that we secure for ourselves a favorable conclusion. Our man in Africa, Hans Hüttig, holds the key."

  BRG_out_of_the_shadows:0 "Out Of The Shadows"
  BRG_out_of_the_shadows_desc:0 "Hüttig is a bold man, yet the brevity which we require for our goals is far beyond what he has thus far displayed. We must embolden him and his Afrikan SS further, so that there may be no doubt of conflict escalation. And nothing is more emboldening than strength, or rather, the illusion of strength.\n\nWe shall ship out some of our very own military forces to Ostafrika at once. From there, they will be directly deployed into the fray, where they shall no doubt perform with deadly efficiency. Seeing such professional forces in action upon their side will surely grant untold confidence to the Ostafrikans, speeding their previously delayed efforts into motion."

  BRG_hiding_in_plain_sight:0 "Hiding In Plain Sight"
  BRG_hiding_in_plain_sight_desc:0 "Just as "American" armaments were discreetly shipped to the South Africans so that they could continue their fight, the Ostafrikans too require the means to fight. Whilst Hüttig has not been entirely strapped for armaments, if he is to be nudged towards larger efforts, he must have confidence in his stockpiles. We shall give him plentiful confidence."

  BRG_igniting_huttigs_rage:0 "Igniting Hüttig's Rage"
  BRG_igniting_huttigs_rage_desc:0 "The lush jungles of Ostafrika are home to many things. Exotic wildlife, tremendous sights, and an untold stockpile of chemical weapons. Lethal gases stockpiled throughout the final solution and conquest of Africa now rest securely within well concealed warehouses throughout Africa. It is a source of limitless potential.\n\nIf only Hüttig's fragile rage were to be truly ignited, and his bountiful gaseous weapons unleashed with his rage, perhaps this South African skirmish could evolve in a true war to end all wars..."

  BRG_the_call_to_arms:0 "The Call To Arms"
  BRG_the_call_to_arms_desc:0 "Heydrich is the only one of the participants of the Bürgerkrieg to hold true to National Socialism. The rest are traitors, their loyalty owed only to capital, haughty generals, or their own egoism. They will all meet their deserved end, as surely as the sun will rise. Yet, it is still incumbent upon us to ensure that the sun rises sooner than later. The German SS pales in comparison to the might of the Burgundian SS, and although we cannot afford to send the whole of our army into the Rhineland to dispatch with the traitors, we will do all that we can to support Heydrich in his rightful ascent to command over Germania. "

  BRG_in_heydrichs_wake:0 "In Heydrich's Wake"
  BRG_in_heydrichs_wake_desc:0 "A particular weakness of Heydrich's branch of the SS is the lack of due diligence with which it carries out the stabilization of the frontiers of war. When the German SS sweep into a conquered town, they might only find a dozen or so dissidents worthy enough to execute. Were the Burgundian SS to conduct the same operation in the same town, they would certainly kill at least a hundred. Heydrich's men can focus their efforts on the front lines of the war-pacifying the rear is a task best left to us."

  BRG_flood_the_border:0 "Flood The Border"
  BRG_flood_the_border_desc:0 "Bombs explode and bullets approach from the horizon all over the Reich, and this devastation has not been conducive to the manufacturing capability of Heydrich's swath of territory. If their own factors are not capable of sustaining the war, then it falls on us as his sponsor to fill in the gaps. Those loyal to Heydrich in the Reich who cannot find themselves a rifle of German make to fight with shall fight with a Burgundian one, and the border of the Ordensstaat and the Reich shall be flooded with all manner of war material. It is of a special importance to the Reichsführer-SS that Heydrich wins this war, and the sacrifice of a portion of our industrial capacity is far from too high a price to pay to meet this end."

  BRG_death_from_a_mile_away:0 "Death From A Mile Away"
  BRG_death_from_a_mile_away_desc:0 "The treacherous fiends that fight against a Reich that is truly National Socialist can best be described as 'snakes', and there is an old and a true adage about snakes and heads. A skilled marksman with a good rifle and an extra pair of eyes can turn a well disciplined enemy platoon into disorganized rabble; an excellent return on investment for our purposes. The best snipers our armies have to offer will be sent to the front line to assist Heydrich against the foe, and hopefully impart some of the fundamentals on to his own men. Only the steelest of men can hold fast when death comes from a mile away, and only our men are cut of true steel."

  BRG_terrorkampagne:0 "Terrorkampagne"
  BRG_terrorkampagne_desc:0 "The air is the most modern of the environs of war, and there too shall the torch of National Socialism hold sway. Every enemy fighter rendered into burning rubble and every enemy city rendered the same will be monuments to the Vaterland-they will be as bonfires, celebrating the victory of the German people over the traitor armies by burning alive the same treasonous swine that sought to corrupt our good women and men. The enemy will know terror, and he will tremble night and day at the thought that the next plane he hears flying overhead will be his last."

  BRG_leading_the_charge:0 "Leading The Charge"
  BRG_leading_the_charge_desc:0 "We are done "assisting" Heydrich in his war. Now, as the Bürgerkrieg intensifies, is time for us to lead the charge ourselves. The warriors of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund will show Heydrich's loyalists how to fight from example. Our divisions, on the frontline of our own Vaterland, will hold the candle marching into the darkness of the rotten world beyond. Every soldier that fights against us is guilty of treason, and will be afforded treason's legal penalty-as will any of Heydrich's forces who fail to live up to the standards we expect of them. Half-measures are fully over. It is time that Heydrich's attempt to seize power in the Reich either succeds or fails."

  BRG_the_spartan_phalanx:0 "The Spartan Phalanx"
  BRG_the_spartan_phalanx_desc:0 "The frustration of our counterparts in the German SS to achieve victory thus far can be attributed to a failure of leadership. As such, it is time that our seasoned leaders begin replacing the most incompetent and least racially pure of Heydrich's own counterparts. Many of his officers have shown talent in the civil war, and will maintain their charges. The rest will be gone, meeting the same fate that rightfully befalls any officer who neglects the responsibilities of command. Only those loyal to our regime and truly steadfast in their dedication to National Socialism have any place in the chain of command. A phalanx is only as formidable as its weakest shield."

  BRG_blot_out_the_sun:0 "Blot Out The Sun"
  BRG_blot_out_the_sun_desc:0 "Everything in the Ordensstaat capable of flight will be sent east to aid in the war. Our fighters will be mass produced at the tallest heights of production thought reasonable to mandate, and then 10% more. Our aircraft shall blot out the sun over the Reich, and the coming of the shade will be the coming of the SS. Ours is the side of the Bürgerkrieg of the most pure of the German people fighting for the most zealous interpretation of the German ideology, and we are equally proud of both. Let the gunfire raining from the sky be our testament to the ancestors of the German nation that we still hold to them, and we fight the traitors in their name."

  BRG_fire_and_brimstone:0 "Fire And Brimstone"
  BRG_fire_and_brimstone_desc:0 "Guns are not enough. Bombs are not enough. To destroy most of the enemy, to damage his industry moderately, to kill many of his men-it is not enough. We must have it all. They all must die, they all must crumble, they all must burn: and there are few weapons capable of achieving this totality of destruction. Thankfully for the nation, the superiority of German science has long conceived of an answer to the conundrum of moderation in warfare. All across the Ordensstaat, rocket facilities and weapons to launch from them are being constructed, that we might smite not a single enemy from a single mile away, but thousands of enemies from hundreds of miles away. When rockets rain down on the industrialists factories, liberal universities are obliterated in explosions, and the prides of generals are reduced to ash in their mouths at the site of the calamities befalling their armies, the only Germans left standing will be those standing behind our lines."

A shame, but Heydrich is best remembered as a symbol of how far the Reich has fallen. Regardless, that does not mean we cannot gain from his defeat.

We will reach out to the logistics officers we have identified as acceptable, and offer them safe haven from the slavering barbarians who seek to punish them for the crime of cleansing the Vaterland of its sickness.\n\nWithin the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, they will find purpose.

Yet the Reichsführer-SS is capable of mercy, and has instructed that we bring them into the Ordensstaat. Here they will be carefully screened and observed.

The land remains in chaos, and the nuclear bombs remain poorly secured and guarded.\n\nOf course, a large operation to recover them would attract the attention of the other contenders, and we do not wish that at this early stage. Yet the Reichsführer, in his cunning, has determined a means of extracting what we can.\n\nWe will send small teams into Heydrich's old territory and smuggle out as much as we can, dismantle what is necessary, and sabotage the rest.

Degenerate liberals and corrupt, stagnant fools!.\n\nHowever, there remains a single, small hope - Hermann Göring.\n\nNot in saving the Reich, of course. Göring is as lost as any of the others - and it is not him who is important, but his militarist allies. Schörner is a bloodhound who will use Göring to wage war on a rebellious Europe - leaving us in peace.

Like animals, they are most motivated by hatred against the Aryan race, and the enslavement and toil of many has certainly caused this feeling to grow.\n\nAnd like rabid animals, when set loose they will lash out.\n\nThe ultimate fate of these slaves does not matter. All that is important is the chaos they cause. Our men within the Reich will covertly work to sabotage the slave camps and let chaos be sown throughout Vaterland. With the loss of their slaves, their supply lines will be crippled - allowing us greater freedom to act as necessary."

Let them stew in its decadence and perversion, as it will no matter who wins. Their actions are no longer important - For now, we will focus on our internal matters.\n\nIt may not seem like anything of worth can be learned from Heydrich's SS, but the Reichsführer-SS has wisely determined that the members of Heydrich's SS whom are acceptable should be consulted. While Heydrich was a failure, there are lessons to be learned from his collapse.\n\nOnce their notes and experiences are compiled, our best and brightest will use this to incorporate into our own forces to refine and shape an SS that will be stalwart defenders of the Aryan people - and most importantly will never fail."

We shall establish a special division to expunge France from all textbooks, with censor and propagandist working together we will banish the gross inequity of the past to make way for an uplifting future.\n\nFrance was never meaningfully independent from the Fatherland anyway. At most they were a satellite state, but in truth they have always been a vassal, a tributary, a subaltern to the Aryan race. The French SS officers who have joined since the establishment of the Ordensstaat will understand that this reflects a deep spiritual reality, that they themselves are not yet Aryan. They will be grateful for the lesson. Everyone shall be."

 BRG_globalplan_adler_decisions_desc:0 "The Reich, what once was the glimmering hallmark of Aryan Masterdom against a world of putridity, in which the Vaterland would stand triumphant against the Judeo-Bolshevists who would dare call themselves equal to our mighty grasp, has since fallen into a despairful pit of decadence, sin, and treason. So great is the extreme putridity characterizing the Reich that it fell into its own horrific Civil War, pitting the Germanic Master Race against itself in a horrific gladiatorial arena throughout the Reich. Now, however, only one false Führer stands to call themselves leader of the Aryan people, gutting the strength of the Germanic people even more as they feed the bloated corpse of the Reich more lies every passing day in order to maintain the survival of their unholy power. However, while this sickly beast continues to crawl through the mud of this world to try to find power, the Ordensstaat poised to strike, ready to do all we can to bring down this fallen behemoth who once dared called themselves the masters of this solemn world. And with how deranged the country has become, it shall not be long until they aid greatly towards the Reichsführer-SS's plan..."

 ###Events

 BRG_adler.1.t:0 "Shadows on the Rail"
 BRG_adler.1.d:0 ""Agents Ten, Twelve, Thirteen, Thirty-Three, make way upon the railing above." Echoed the earpieces of the Aryan servants of the Ordensstaat's shadow. Thus, the men descended from the roof onto the dark balconies above, hidden away under the shadow of the night as their rifles came ready to use upon the floor below. \n\nThe factory doors came to a crash as the men entered the room, ready to meet just whoever so happened to have contacted the legendary Businessman of the Reich at this time of the night. "Uh, hello, anyone there?" said the Businessman, in the most regal attire of a trenchcoat as his guards smoked cigars. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." echoed a voice from the darkness, as a man took a few paces to greet the entourage upon their entrance into the area. "Supposing, at this time of the night, you'd enjoy the skipping of pleasantries so that business may be conducted?" the man said, adorned in mystery. Flick shook his head slowly in response. "Well, then allow me to begin. You see, there are elements of this world which lurk under the watchful eyes of Dictators, Generals, the Reich, and even the Führer himself, Herr Flick. Elements of this world which would like to see themselves involved in the meandering of Speerian governing, and are willing to pay handsomely for it." The man said, opening a briefcase full of Reichsmarks. \n\nWith the dark room laid to silence, Herr Flick continued to ponder the question for just a few minutes, until finally, his eyes brightened up. With a shaking of hands, the Reichsmark were taken that day, and the Ordensstaat had a way straight to Speer's heart. \n\n"Alright, gentlemen, lay down your rifles." the Man said, as the clambering of military gear being set down began."
 BRG_adler.1.a:0 "Terror to some, greatness for us."

 BRG_adler.3.t:0 "The Facade of a Million Shadows"
 BRG_adler.3.d:0 "The Office of the Führer deep within the Halls of Germania was once embellished with the great calls for glory from the illustrious Adolf Hitler, the marching, arm-locked-in-arm, of Generals discussing the glory of the Reich's conquests, and the countless citizens of Germania enjoying, for themselves, the Empire which gave them dominion over the world. Now, however, the Führer himself lies in silence, begging himself not to take another cigarette in fear of his health, hand clasped in hand, as he stares into the distance, telephone in hand. \n\n"My Führer, the ongoing protests within several of the Reich's universities are not, I repeat, not at the hands of remaining Civil War elements. A series of documents have been circulating to the public, sir. A series of documents about you, my Führer." the voice said gravely over the telephone. \n\n"What do they say, Gruppenführer?" Speer said, being met with a few moments of silence. "Gruppenführer, what the hell did they say?" the Führer said, in a mix of terror and great, seething anger. \n\n"Sir, they. They discuss information regarding your participation in the extended extermination of non-Aryans over the course of the Second World War and the years following." The military leader said, sending the painful shiver of horror straight into the void that made up the Führer's soul. "Students are responding in organization over the issue, asking you directly for answers, my Führer." \n\nThe realization of the painful setback of progress for the Reich shook Speer. No longer could he work towards securing his position of leadership in the Reich riding upon the pure faith of the reformists without answering towards the untold truths which lie at his feet. What has begun must be dealt with as always, however."
 BRG_adler.3.a:0 "I will handle it personally, Gruppenführer."

 BRG_adler.4.t:0 "A Devoted Soul"
 BRG_adler.4.d:0 ""So, Herr Flick, you have provided that, under the direct submittance of an additional seven and a half million Reichsmarks, that you shall be within immediate compliance towards general coordinated statements forwarded by our office, am I correct?" the icy, rasped voice of the Reichsführer-SS echoed out over the telephone towards the Businessman of the Reich. \n\n"National Socialism brought greatness to the Reich, it made the Reich whole. I am more than willing to do what I can as a true patriot to the German country and her people and stave off Speer's corruption; however, I simply have a few questions. Firstly, what will I be doing in accordance with our agreement, what do I have to do to ensure we do right by the Reich?" Flick said, meeting silence on the other end of the line. "And what about anonymity? My name is going to be scratched off of any documents regarding our deals and whatnot, correct?" Flick asked again. Meanwhile, the phone line continue to meet his expectations with a droning monotone. \n\n"You will find out soon, Herr Flick, but do not worry: no one shall know of our deals, and the millions you have earned from them." the Reichsführer-SS stated, as the phone line hung up. Six hundred miles apart from one another, both men took steps back from their chair, and readied themselves for the coming future."
 BRG_adler.4.a:0 "His patriotism shall be our gain."

 BRG_adler.5.t:0 "Bloody Ferdinand's Escape"
 BRG_adler.5.d:0 ""That's fucking bullshit, Kessler, there's no way in Hell that He could have gotten out of that compound that quickly, we had our men on every door into the goddamn place!" Wedekind said, crashing his cigar to the ashtray in anger. "The Führer is asking for our goddamn department to handle this, and we can't even find this shithead!" he said, filling the office with anger. \n\n"When did the unites at the East entrance last report?" Kessler said, as he continued to stare straight at the map below him on the table. \n\n"What the fuck are you talking about, Kessler? Twenty-Six hours ago, right after they went on patrol when they lost this monster, remember the damn report?" Wedekind said. \n\n"That's what I mean. Get a report from them, now. Find where they are, who they're with, their names, everything." Kessler said, as Wedekind confusingly went off to fulfill the task at hand. An hour later, the creaky door opened back into the investigation room as Wedekind made his way back into the room, report in hand and sunken eyes to match. "What's it say?" Kessler said. \n\n"Killed. Slaves got them, every last one of them, beat them to death with a few stab wounds in each." Wedekind responded. \n\nThe two men sat in a cold, silent anguish over the thoughts of what happened. That was before Kessler shot out his chair and grabbed Wedekind. "Wedekind, you listen here and you listen close. Look at that map and tell me, where in the Hell did slaves come out of nowhere when their nearest compound is dozens of miles away?" Kessler said, filling Wedekind with a great fear of the unknown."
 BRG_adler.5.a:0 "I-I don't know."

 BRG_adler.8.t:0 "The Pilot's Flight"
 BRG_adler.8.d:0 "The Reichsführer-SS sat patiently, quietly, and coldly, dancing his fingers upon the table as he waited for the incoming report his presence had been requested for. And, as  if on cue by the grand director of this wretched life, Ernst Kaltenbrunner came in, manilla folder in hand. "Glory to the Reichsführer-SS." stated the Nazi towering over the desk, offering his greatest Nazi salute. "Sir, these cold mornings have allowed for us a great victory in the fall of the succumbing Reich." he said, handing his superior the folder. \n\nAs the papers flipped by, the Reichsführer-SS continued to understand the meaning of these messages. That Fat Pig claiming to be the Führer as he waddled around, medallions in hand, is marching onward towards a new Grand War Strategy, dubbed "War Plan B," dedicated towards the annexation of further territories in the ravaging quest for new splendors for the Reich in their new failure. The Turkish, the Iberians, the Italians, the Russians, the Syrians, and the Africans would all come to meet a wall of the Reich's soldiers if all would go according to the plans of the decadent Hermann Göring. \n\n"Return to your duties, Herr Kaltenbrunner." the Reichsführer-SS said, as his underling marched off. Finally, it was time for the Ordensstaat to begin the immediate production of arms and equipment for these nations, and finally get involved with a little "foreign aid" in order to play catch up with the Reich's forward motion, and ensure their collapse comes yet."
 BRG_adler.8.a:0 "Göring will fail yet."

 BRG_adler.11.t:0 "Conquest on the Horizon"
 BRG_adler.11.d:0 "Ernst Kaltenbrunner once again found his way into the Reichsführer-SS's office as he twisted and turned down the halls of the High Command of the Ordensstaat. "Heil Reichsführer-SS." he said with a strong salute, yet exasperated and fearful breath. "Our agents have discovered immediately pertinent intelligence regarding the Führer's plan with the Ordensstaat, sir." He said, shifting the thick manilla folder towards the Reichsführer-SS's face. \n\n"I shall handle this personally, Herr Kaltenbrunner. You are dismissed, for now." the Reichsführer-SS said, as Kaltenbrunner shut the iron door behind him. Opening the document in front of him, the Reichsführer-SS's eyes' meeting of the words "Fall Schwarz" brought a great discovery to his mind... \n\nThe greatest key to the Plan he has ever found. \n\nThus, the Reichsführer-SS prepared. Yes, it was true that this a great discovery for the benefit of the future; however, how could he hope to achieve success if the plans were not in place? Allowing the Reich to run over and invade the Ordensstaat was an obvious impossibility if he sought to enact the Plan. Thus, he would have to prepare the great and mighty Aryans of the Ordensstaat to pledge every single man, every single resource, and every single bullet, towards waging a great war with the Rech. This would be their fate. This was destiny."
 BRG_adler.11.a:0 "Ragnarök awaits."

 BRG_adler.13.t:0 "Keep your Enemies Closer"
 BRG_adler.13.d:0 ""And that's how you managed to keep those Russian regiments on the run at Suslov? Tell me, tell me, what happened after the battle, Gruppenführer?" the amicable Walther Hewel stated, laughing as he ate. \n\n"Well, that's where I earned this." the SS-Gruppenführer stated as he pointed in the large scar across his left cheek. "The Russians had just enough explosives planted in their retreat to make it work, and took out a swathe of my man, and left me blind in my left eye for quite some time. But the Aryan does not give in, Mr. Hewel, he does not give up." The SS-Gruppenführer stated, causing the Foreign Minister of the Bormann administration to roar with laughter and giddiness towards the tale of war and bloodshed. "You are one mighty creature, Gruppenführer, a Lion in the company of Mice! Please, here is my personal office's telephone number, do be sure to call and we can talk anytime, they give me whatever I want up there, and you can get well paid in turn!" said Hewel, as he got up from the leather chair and walked away to grab more food, as the SS-Gruppenführer called \n\n"Sir, I would request one favor of you." he said to the listening Walther Hewel. "Stay evermore devoted to the glorious Führer Bormann, a true patriot." Hewel offered a smile and nod as he walked off. The SS-Gruppenführer, however, could not understand the nature of the operation. Why would the Reichsführer-SS desire to support the foundations of these idiots? Hewel could hardly keep himself contained and became a walking embarrassment over a small story of War in the West, how could we support these degenerates? The Reichsführer-SS must have a plan, and faith will be required if he sought the will to maintain this position and earn the Ordensstaat an inside to this entire spider web in the Reich."
 BRG_adler.13.a:0 "Degenerates, all of them."

 BRG_adler.14.t:0 "Strange Waters"
 BRG_adler.14.d:0 "The Führer, Martin Bormann, worked diligently upon his desk in his office in Germania. Everyday, incoming military, political, and economic reports gave new and rising situations regarding the Reich and her troubles, whilst the Führer himself offered estimations and calculations about how to conceptualize fixes for all these messes. One such mess required not fixing, yet still occupied Bormann's mind for quite some time: what was going on to cause the recent outspoken support from so much of the Administration, especially in a perilous time like this? \n\n"My Führer! Just the man I wanted to see!" said the Foreign Minister, Walther Hewel, as he crashed through the office. "I just had the most wonderful conversation at the Party Rally yesterday, sir, and I was reminded of just what I needed to do!" the Minister said, loudly for this time in the morning. \n\n"Ah, really? And what is it that you must do at a time like this, Hewel?" Bormann asked with a degree of annoyance and scorn as he lit a cigarette. \n\n"Well, sir, that's just it: it's you! The mighty Führer, Martin Bormann, who saved the Reich from collapse and preserved the legacy of the mighty Adolf Hitler! You have made our lives and prosperity possible, and no one seems to be cheery enough to say that anymore, sir! Thank you, and, remember, my office is always free to offer you what I can provide!" Hewel said, as he pat Bormann on the back and left. \n\nAnd there it was again. Another leader in the administration, overjoyed at everything Bormann was doing. This couldn't be right: the Reich was still facing issues, and as much as Hewel may be a fool, he wasn't just so easily able to overlook that. What was going on with the administration to flood these compliments? Then again, perhaps, the Führer thought to himself, maybe it was just time to offer himself some more credit for once."
 BRG_adler.14.a:0 "To worry or not?"

 BRG_adler.15.t:0 "A Phantom of Sorrows and Wealth"
 BRG_adler.15.d:0 "The brick and mortar walls of this ancient fortress filled the Businessman with fears of the children's stories of phantoms of Germany's past. However, he knew a great deal more about the terror able to be enacted by the phantoms he was surrounded with, whether it be the soul-draining nature of Speer's corruption, or the paralyzing fear of the men he worked with now. Thus came the terror as the Businessman turned and saw the the Scarred Giant of the Schutzstaffel enter the office. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." spoke the menacing voice that flowed through the Giant. \n\n"Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner, it is an honor." stated Flick, with a slight hint of mistruth as his terror ensured the tension of the meeting. \n\n"Sit down, Herr Flick. We have much to discuss." said Kaltenbrunner, as he came around to sit beside the Businessman. "Herr Flick, it has come under the understanding of your devotion to the cause of National Socialism, and your willingness to support the cause through the tragedies of the modern day which harm it so greatly. Thus, in accordance with your transactionary deals, your immediate orders are to cede as great a percentile of operations for your industries towards Führer Bormann's regime immediately." Kaltenbrunner said. \n\n"This is an outrage, those are my profits, my hard earned business success! How could we support that fool in times like these, this is treachery, this is an insult!" shouted Flick. \n\n"Herr Flick, you will understand the orders you have been provided and see they come into fruition or else face the bylaws of our contract." stated Kaltenbrunner as the two SS guards in the back took a step forward. As Flick sat back down, he could not help but cede his own will to the Scarred Giant across from him."
 BRG_adler.15.a:0 "It must be done."

 BRG_adler.16.t:0 "Reports, Redactions, and Removals"
 BRG_adler.16.d:0 "The pleasing mild successes accomplished by the Führer and his administration, managing to keep a smile plastered onto the people's faces had been assailed by a new confusing issue. The Führer continued to look onward, enjoying his organization and structure as a Master of the Bureaucrats, and, yet, something was wrong. Very wrong. As Bormann searched and scurried through his office, running his hand over every drawer and cubby, something was gone. \n\nMissing. \n\nSeveral things were. Yet, also, things that weren't here at the last point the Führer had come into his office had made their way onto his shelves and cases, when his secretary hadn't requested file transfers or anything of the sort! The matter brought sweat to the already-hardworked Führer's forehead, as the panic and confusion and paranoia of dissent and trickery plagued his mind. No, this couldn't have been, this was a simple trick, a mistake in the wake of the Führer's great work across the Reich taking up so much of his own time. However, in that slight chance, what if it truly is someone else instead? The Führer knew not, as he set his pen down and grasped his face, trying to ease his tensions."
 BRG_adler.16.a:0 "Get a hold of yourself."

 BRG_wolf_globalplan_wolf_desc:0 "To the unaware eye it may seem stable, but our agents know that if we play our cards correctly, the Italian Empire will soon fall into chaos. Although its subversion is not as crucial to our plans as a few others, Italy holds much exploitable economic opportunities we can use for funding, stagnant cocoons of liquid gold awaiting our knives to plunge into. These manifest in holes in the integrity of the corporatist hierarchy, corrupt fascists willing to tear themselves open for counterfeit lire. The colonial order will be sustained until we have drained every last drop. Rome will suckle on our breasts, not knowing that our wolves are laced with poison. Here's to the tragedy to ensure."
 BRG_wolf_black_sun_over_the_levant_text:0 "Black Sun Over The Levant"
 BRG_wolf_black_sun_over_the_levant_desc:0 "The Italian Middle East, already a colony brimming with ethnic tension and administrative woes, is bound to fall into bloody conflict with its northern neighbors in Turkey. Toppling the fragile colonial orders of both down until a region-spanning war occurs would allow our plans in the Middle East to come into fruition. To do this, we will fund paramilitaries and terrorists to wreak havoc for our machinations. Palestinian liberation parties will inspire intercommunal violence, Jewish ultranationalists will massacre villages, and the incompotent adminstrators will utterly fail to resolve the crumbling wall that seperates the northern and southern corridors of Lebanon. The black sun of hate will rise."

As such, the most rugged of our reserves suitable for conflict in the Middle East will be supplied to the  Italian colonists who travelled to the colony in hopes of a better life, whose rage at the violence they collectively suffer will boil to the point of active vengeance. A new crusade, to no avail but blood."
 BRG_wolf_provoke_the_bull_desc:0 "The Turkish high command is full of blisteringly conservative leaders who favor a stable, guided approach to quelling tensions with their neighbors and the lands divided by their hand. Our agents, however, know how to manipulate their wills and their intentions so they will either become receptive to the idea of an incursion into the governorate, or will be replaced with those unknowingly cooperative. Their dreams of glory will be fulfilled, or we will manufacture the dream. To do this, we have devised a variety of methods- including highlighting the voices of extremism and militarism as for intervention to seem like the most moderate option, or ensuring reports on violence at the border to always reach Ankara without fail. Lines will be drawn by us for their economic woes and struggles to originate from Lebanon, and they will blindly accept the correlation. The republic will be dragged into this hell, and there will be no screams of help, at least none that can be understood."

The Turks are the reviled enemy of many races in the Levant who mock them as "cockroaches" and neo-Ottoman oppressors, and however accurate their epithets may be, this hatred is ideal for our operations in intensifying the war in the Middle East. By supplying the Turks with the armaments they desire and the upgrades they need to efficiently commit their massacres and their crimes, we will always prevail as the only decisive victor."

However, what this front of United Arabs do provide is radical notions to dispose of Italian influence in the Middle East, and with radicalism comes the next great massacre, with the blood of martyred warriors painting the steps towards the Vision of the Reichsführer-SS.

And, if sending out our courageous Germanic warriors to settle the conflicts our mutual interests seem to be failing in, then such a deployment is what we shall commence. However, to send in full units of the Ordensstaat's men would be diplomatically ruinous, not to mention disastrous for potential openings into our clandestine operations.

By funneling supplies to the radical groups on the left and right alike, infiltrating all sectors of American society, and building a network of connections able to further the will of the Reichsfurher, we will at last bring the American "giant" to its knees. By the order of the Reichsfurher-SS, the exploitation and sabotage of the New World's vast array of resources is of highest priority.

However, in their foolishness, the true masters of the continent have left the Americans with at least a partially functioning "democracy."

The DR's are the typical weak-willed lot you tend to see in charge in democracies. In general, our goals when dealing with their leadership will have to be DELEGITIMIZING them. By forcing them to commit to strenuous foreign wars while undermining their political authority at home, we can force them into refusing to back off from conflict flashpoints and generally weaken them at home, potentially allowing for the NPP to take power.\n\nFor their part, the NPP will have to be RADICALIZED. Their ranks contain everything from well-meaning liberals like George Wallace to bloodthirsty bolshevik radicals like Michael Harrington, only united by their common hatred of the Japanese state that humiliated them in the forties.\n\n As we have little way to guarantee that whichever candidate their shadowy masters select will have sensible views in regards to international policy, we must seek to undermine their domestic policy in order to force them into the arms of the militarist hawk faction, splitting and weakening them at every juncture possible to accelerate fringe candidates and a strong, militarist state.\n\nOnce the DELEGITIMIZING and RADICALIZING have taken place, the final phase will be to CREATE MILITARY FLASHPOINTS.

Andre grabbed a stapled, crumpled, and damp-smelling letter. The letter was a great example of the most common piece of writing sent to RFK: A man from Georgia explains in a five page long essay that the "...institution of segregation will remain eternal in the American Deep South." The audacity and stunning conviction of that made Andre think that no possible letter could be worth sending to the President. Moments after picking up another letter, he changed his mind. A letter from a young girl attending Harvard, RFK's alamater, expressing her positive opinions on his policies regarding civil rights.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the President opened up the new re-packaged letter, to read about a young girl's message to the President.

Increasingly, it is the white man, who will always find another sympathetic white man to help them - if they keep everyone else in their place. \n\nAnd throughout it all, President Harrington is silent, chasing dreams in the clouds while losing sight of the misery of the people on Earth. \n\nAt least, that's what the rumors said.

 BRG_gcw.1.d:0 "The report that Heydrich held was short, curt, and had been expediently delivered to him an outpost on the shared German-Burgundian border that was carefully monitored. He'd had an expectation of what would be inside, and the script was prompt, to the point, and most importantly, expected. \n\nMore soldiers from Burgundy had crossed the border. The report described them dressed as men whose uniforms lacked labels, symbols, or anything that would identify them as Burgundian. The only exceptions were the twin bolts of the SS on their helmets - which was hardly unique to Burgundy. \n\nDespite that, Heydrich knew that everyone knew who they were, and who they represented. \n\nHimmler would not remain idle. Not when the National Socialist ideal could be restored. \n\nHeydrich was not especially concerned that this would be ultimately controversial to the other pretenders even if links could be proven. It was expected that he and Himmler were connected, and if Speer, Bormann, and Göring had their own allies - he could also accept help from his own. There was a long, bloody fight ahead. \n\nAt the same time, he was not a fool. Himmler almost certainly was having his divisions conducting other operations within Germany while supporting his own bid for Germany - but that was a matter that he would not broach now. There was a war to win, and he had best do it before he was crushed."

 BRG_gcw.2.d:0 "A line of trucks crossed the bridge under a moonless night. \n\nThey were unmarked, but they were clearly intended for military usage. Most would recognize the design as German, and only the true experts would note the ever-so-slight changes that differentiated it from those used in Germany. And there was only one place where such a vehicle could come from. \n\nThe Black State. \n\nThe trucks stopped at the outpost, exchanged a few words with the guards, and were guided by Heyrich's SS forces to park and deploy. Soldiers exited from the trucks, men with stoic faces; men who walked with an unnaturally controlled and precise movement. Their uniforms were clearly derived from the SS, grey and black as the night they were arriving in. Yet the only indication of who they were was the twin bolts on the sides of their helmets. \n\nGottlieb was just an SS soldier, a guard who was charged with making sure the German-Burgundian border was secure. He didn't have interactions with the actual Burgundians other than watching them come across the border. There were more this time there than the last. More trucks arrived, soldiers exited, and marched to meet with one of Heydrich's officers who began organizing the reinforcements. \n\nFrom his own observation, he felt like there were a lot of Burgundians now in Germany. It was good, since they needed all the help they could get to win the civil war. However he couldn't help but think about the rumors surrounding Himmler; about how Heydrich was his puppet. He shook his head. Nonsense, of course, but it did make him pay close attention to the Burgundians. \n\nBecause he was sure not all of them were soldiers."

"Officer Fischbein." \n\n"Officer Kantorowicz," he said, returning the opening salute. "I'll direct you to Officer Tanne. We have some fronts where we could use your soldiers." \n\nOfficer Tanne by his side indicated for the Burgundian to follow him, and he did as the other Burgundian soldiers disembarked from their trucks, weapons in hand as they prepared to transfer to other trucks that would take them to the front. At this point Elias had lost count how many Burgundians were here now. \n\nIn the beginning they'd kept diligent records on who exactly was crossing, as Heydrich ordered that there was a full accounting of who was crossing the border. However as the war had continued, this had become less important. The fronts needed soldiers, and soldiers as soon as possible. There was no paperwork now, there was only moving as many soldiers into action as soon as possible. \n\nHe couldn't help but wonder what Himmler's endgame here was. There were a substantial number of Burgundians who were in Germany now, and fighting in the civil war. He wondered how many had died, and was sure it was a lot. This was a substantial investment, and some of the men here were wondering if Burgundy would actually intervene directly. \n\nElias didn't think so. Not after France. But the rumors persisted, some almost with hope as the war dragged on. They would die for Heydrich when all was said and done - but each knew the odds were against them - and ironically, their own hope came from the nation of the Black Sun."

We have been working to identify the source of these assassination, and have acquired intelligence indicating this is not a phenomenon exclusive to our forces.\n\nOther contenders are also experiencing attacks on their officer corps, and we believe this to be the work of SS spies, likely from the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. These spies have infiltrated our forces, are behind our lines, and are causing chaos on the fronts even as we work to adapt to this changing environment. All SS assassins have committed suicide when they have been pursued and cornered. We consider the possibility of successfully capturing them unlikely.\n\nThese assassinations have nonetheless had a tangible impact on our fighting capability.

Witnesses report a number of suspicious figures near the bombing site prior to detonation, who wore no identifying markings. \n\nIt is almost certain that Himmler is attempting to obfuscate his meddling in the conflict, and that these terror attacks are not isolated to just our forces. The primary bomb was placed in a major arms factory, resulting in significant damage. \n\nSmaller bombs were placed around other vital infrastructure including power grids, water pumps, and places of mass civilian concentration, including schools and stores. There have been several dozen civilians killed from this attack, and several hundred who are injured and are currently being treated. \n\nRecovering from this attack will require a significant amount of time and resources and cost us manpower, and money.

Engineers are working to restore the equipment to full functionality, but the explosions claimed the lives of a number of maintenance staff, as well as bystanders.\n\nA subsequent lockdown and interrogation of witnesses has led to the culprits almost certainly being SS infiltrators who are almost certainly connected to the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. We were unable to capture any of these infiltrators alive, and several that we did corner committed suicide before they could be subdued.\n\nThis raises significant concerns as to our internal security, and ability to counter these infiltrations.

Thus far railways and other critical infrastructure has remained untouched due to the intention of other contenders to utilize it for their own forces. \n\nWith this railway sabotaged, the region will almost certainly experience multiple supply issues until it is repaired. Our engineers and labor are moving to restore the railway as fast as possible, but we will need to be careful with our current supply, and use our forces carefully. \n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"

Schörner examined the man through his thick brimmed sunglasses. No older than 20, he supposed. A tragedy for the mother involved in making this little child, but this was war. Not just war, but a war amongst brothers. Nothing was off-limits now. Every man, woman and child was a target in the struggle for the future.\n\nFerdinand felt Frederick and Blücher's eyes watching him - their vengeful spirits watching his damnation. They mourned the death of Germany, and they grieved for the fate of their eras. Schörner, too, mourned their passing. Childhood stories of Prussian heroism and extraordinary feats against the dastardly Austrians, French and - most of all - the accursed Russian Empire were now nothing but a casualty to the winds of time. Prussia was dead, with only its damned successor to look after its remains. Schörner looked at his hands - the hands bloodied by patricide. He would never wipe them clean.\n\nThe Field Marshal did not remember what the young man said. He could have said 'Heil Göring ". He could have told Ferdinand to fornicate with his parents. Either way, he moved on to the next cadet. This war would never end. Not at le-\n\n"Heil Himmler!" the cadet behind him shouted, pulling out a Mauser.\n\nThe next few seconds were hazy, as they always were during combat. A shot rang out, dropping Schörner to the ground like a wet bag of concrete. A flurry of shots responded to the assassination attempt, pinning the corpse of the would-be assassin to the wall behind him. Ferdinand's bodyguards came over, rolling their boss over. Nothing. Not a single wound on him.\n\nWhat they did find was a furious Field Marshal gesturing at his bent ankle. Kicking, screaming and still very much alive."

 BRG_kondor.1.desc:0 "Iberia is a bastard state.  This is certainly true of its most recent incarnation, as a patchwork of two governments united only by the desire to hold off the influence of the Reich.  But it has been this way for a very long time.  The peninsula has never known Aryan rule, having been settled by lesser peoples of southern Europe.  Greeks, Phoenicians, Lusitanians, and more.  All of these peoples became a stew of new languages and nations, from the savage Moors to the bizarre Basques.  And this is to say nothing of their centuries of vile Jewish influence.  Altogether, Iberia is a patchwork of inferior peoples that should never have become one unified power.  But this is also an opportunity for us.  Many of these peoples-Basque, Catalan, Asturian, Galician-seek independence from the central government.  Moreover, the Iberian state occupies a unique position on the world stage.  Its economy has been wrecked by the Gibraltar Dam, but it also finds itself in control of the thing.  It has a sizable overseas colonial empire.  In short, there is a great deal of room to further our ambitions through the strange, impure amalgamation that is the Iberian Union."

Its location at the gate to the Mediterranean and the European continent makes the prize of a friendly Iberian polity too valuable for the great powers to resist interfering in the conflict, and tensions are sure to escalate across the globe as they find themselves backing rival factions.\n\nThere is much work to be done. Plans must be adapted, and new ones made. Assets must be activated and put to work.

It seems the only ones the whole peninsula can agree to loathe are the natives in their colonies and the concept of competent government. Without the strong state seen in our Ordensstaat, Iberia fumbles in the dark, always at the brink of immeasurable violence.\n\nLike a house of cards, all we need is one little push on the right card, and it will all come crumbling down.

Not every faction can be as willingly subverted as our friends the Asturians, but that can easily be remedied using our strategically placed insiders. False information about another political faction making it seem the weapons come from us here, a bit of propaganda there, and maybe some slight application of bribery, blackmail and political smearing where necessary. \n\nIf we can continue to successfully wrangle the separatists using our insiders, it may be time to begin considering withdrawing some of our German agents from Iberia, to lessen the risk of detection."

With Salazar holding the reins of power, Iberia would stagnate, more obsessed with retaining old glories than building a state for the modern world.  More importantly, it would be a state that crosses lines in order to achieve dominance over new parts of the globe.  In Algeria, especially, Salazar's Iberia would push its luck, perhaps too far.

The Ordensstaat will supply these groups with all the guns they could ever need.  In return, the profits from this arms smuggling will bring liquid capital back to the Ordensstaat.

They must be weakened, by any means possible, so that they can eventually be killed to a man. It is understated to say that every moment the world continues to tolerate their existence is an affront to civilization and to humanity.\n\nSecondarily, it is incumbent upon us to select among the other warlords one who is most useful to us as a counterweight in the east against our rivals, and to do what we can to either turn the others to his side or else see to their collective ruin. One candidate looks particularly promising, and has even rendered aid upon our Führer once before: the warlord of Vyatka, a man who would style himself an emperor, and would surely not rebuff our assistance in reclaiming his birthright.

Someone back in Paris had picked them for him, just like they had picked his background. He was a river merchant, from a farm village outside Murygino. He had three children: two daughters living with his wife, and a son that died in the war. Which war he died in, and fighting which enemy, depended on who he was speaking to at the time. His identity was eminently plausible, both common and dreary enough to not inspire much questioning. He'd never gotten accustomed to living as 'Simeon', though. Russia was too hostile and alien for him to ever feel at ease here. He mostly stayed by himself ever since arriving, and every time he had to talk to someone—like today—all he had on his mind was the need not to give himself away.\n\nConstruction was underway in Vyatka. An impressive looking port facility was being built along the river, at the behest of the local Tsar. Rumour abound of a plan by the Tsar to earn himself a war chest manufacturing vodka, and it was just that sort of rumour that 'Simeon' was eager to exploit. A medium sized bribe was enough for him to be sat in an office opposite the Crown Representative to the port, discussing a trade agreement Simeon was sure would be too enticing for the bureaucrat to resist. His ships would sail into Vyatka to unload potatoes collected from farm towns connected to the river, and on their way out of the city again, those same crates would be filled with bottles of the Tsar's vodka. Of course, the potato crates would hide secret compartments hiding bullets and disassembled rifles, and many of Simeon's crew were secretly more SS agents.

They each had their own tale to spin about why and how they arrived here, some talking of famine and others explaining away their peculiar manner of speaking with stories about their far away origins.

From there, they produced an extremely efficient printing and inking complex, producing hundreds of propaganda posters a day advertising the campaigns of extremist political parties in the so-called 'Komi Republic'. Decrying the dangers of imminent onslaught from the likes of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the posters depict a Komi Republic on the precipice of destruction, the Red Army about to arrive and crush all of the republic's citizens beneath its boot.

 BRG.5012.t:0 "Outpouring of Support for the Tsar's Crusade"
 BRG.5012.d:0 "The patriotic peoples of Russia have been whipped into a frenzy by the rumours of a coming war between ourselves and the communists to the north. Most all of those Russians who rightly abhor the socialist menace that once destroyed our empire have come over to our side, and even the civilians of the conquered territories are enthusiastic to see their Tsar emerge victorious over the WRRF. Support for conservative, pro-war parties and organizations across Vyatka and beyond is on the rise as citizens take to the streets to demonstrate in support of our regim, and our stockpiles of manpower are being helped along by this outpouring of support too, recruiters reporting a sharp uptick in recruitment into the Imperial Army. With peace and stability at home and more men ready to fight and die for the Tsar than we ever before, we have never been more ready for a showdown against the revolutionary menace than we are today."
 BRG.5012.a:0 "For the Tsar, for God, and for Russia!"

 BRG.5013.t:0 "The Fall of the Bear"
 BRG.5013.d:0 "lthough it seemed that the ever-feuding degenerate Slavs would never manage to rise above their puny squabbles, at last the process of natural selection is playing out, and the warlords are beginning to consolidate. Now we can bring Operation Black Bear -- to undermine the stability of the "democratic" Russian states and help push the Slavic people as a whole into another war with the Reich. As is the path set out by our glorious Reichsfurher-SS, we will set the inferiors against each other, until in their weakness and stupidity they plunge headlong into the great global cleansing, from which the new Aryan order will arise."
 BRG.5013.a:0 "They shall set the world ablaze."

 BRG.5014.t:0 "A Meeting at Midnight"
 BRG.5014.d:0 "There was a stillness on the river Ob that night. A sense of emptiness, a hunger. It was as if every plant and animal was holding their breath. There was no moon in the sky. The stars were concealed behind clouds. There was only blackness. Gaping, yawning, waiting.\n\nAnd then, just past midnight, a man stepped into the clearing. He looked up at the empty sky, down at the cold dark water, and then intently at the path from which he had come. He too was silent. He too was waiting.\n\nNot much later, a second man arrived. The two men glanced at each other, and without speaking drew small coins from hidden pockets. Twin runes were set on the silver, barely visible amidst the darkness.\n\nThe first man was a river-trader, a well known pillar of the community in Vyatka. He was known to give alms to the beggars and candy to the children. The second was a printer from Komi. He was a recluse, but would sometimes come to gatherings. When he did, it was a cause for great celebration, as he told stories of enemies near and far, battles one and battles lost, of heroism and tragedy.\n\nThey were agents of the SD division of the SS-Burgundy. They had one purpose: to unleash chaos and cruelty among the Russian lands, and so further the higher purposes of the Reichsführer-SS.\n\nThe Agents spoke quietly, quickly, and with as few words as possible. Their work in the west was done, it was time to bring the rightful punishment of the Untermensch to Siberia, and move Globalplan Bär one step closer to completion."
 BRG.5014.a:0 "The Shadow State has a far reach."

 BRG.5015.t:0 "A New Arrival"
 BRG.5015.d:0 "There were many empty houses in the city of Orenburg. More often than not the refugees had brought large families that preferred safety in numbers, and the city had lost many of its residents in the wars and raids. The residents of the "Vienna of the Urals" had grown used to the derelict buildings, and were thus rather surprised when overnight one of the hovels transformed into a thriving business. \n\nA new printmaker had arrived, moved in from Komi. He was a genial fellow, who preferred to speak as little as possible of his business and much more about the hectic politics of the Russian wastes. It was unclear who exactly used his business, but they surely seemed to be generous as the presses were turning day and night. In time, the townsfolk grew used to their new neighbor, and ceased to wonder about such things. After all, they were just suddenly realizing the grave danger their precious city state was in, as the great warlords to the east and west alike hovered predatorily overhead. The other nearby principalities were experiencing a similar burst of suspicion and fear, and old wounds and grievances between the Ural states soon resurfaced. \n\nEach passing day seemed to bring another wild rumor of the cruelties and madness of enemies near and far, spurred on, just maybe, by the extraordinarily well-designed fear-mongering posters that had sprouted on every corner. Meanwhile, the printshop stayed lit and humming well into the night, as Orenburg's newest citizen told his stories and performed his dark work."

 BRG.5016.t:0 "Anger and Hate"
 BRG.5016.d:0 "In a place as chaotic as the Russian Wastes, in a state as new as ours, it is only to be expected that the public might be...skeptical... about submitting to the lawful authority. However, it seems that this understandable impulse has escalated into a full blown plague of disillusionment and rebellion. Everywhere the public heaps scorn on our government. Old women spit on our soldiers. Little boys throw rocks at the heads of our magistrates. Unless we do something soon, our control over West Siberia might well be short lived."
 BRG.5016.a:0 "We must do better."

 BRG.5017.t:0 "In the Dead of Night"
 BRG.5017.d:0 "It was midnight, the ground around the arms depot was shiny with frost, reflecting the stars above. Despite the chill, the soldiers were drowsy from a long day of training, and all but asleep on their feet. Suddenly from within the main storage building, there came a colossal explosion. The guards were thrown forward, and though they survived with only minor injuries, they could only watch helplessly as a great portion of our arms stockpile went up in smoke. This is but one of many incidents seemingly aimed at sabotaging our ability to wage war, and no doubt the fault of those two-faced traitors in West Russia."
 BRG.5017.a:0 "Find who did this, immediately!"

 BRG.5018.t:0 "Dark Waters"
 BRG.5018.d:0 "Mikhail underlined the number at the end of his ledger. Excellent, another node on his expanding network of river traders had begun turning a healthy profit. Leaning back in the leather chair he had recently set up in his warehouse, he lit a cigar. The real Cuban stuff; the shipping cost alone to get this in via Finland and downriver to Vyatka meant the box had cost him the same as a pre-war car would have. But some luxuries a man of his wealth co- \n\n"Numbers are looking good, I see?"\n\nMikhail's instincts from a war long ago and decades working in one of the most dangerous professions in the Russian Anarchy kicked in the second the German-accented voice floated out of the dark of the warehouse. His hand found the lovingly maintained Tokarev hidden under the armrest of his chair, and within seconds he had adopted a standing firing stance. When he saw the figure emerge out of the dark, he however lowered his weapon. "Werner? You mad bastard, I almost shot you! What are you doing in Vyatka? I've never seen you east of Kostroma!"\n\nThe pale, skeletally thin Volga German held up a cigarette, and Werner lit it with his cigar. "You are one to speak about where I should and should not appear, Mikhail. You know as well as I do that we rarely had to meet because of our man in Komi. Without him, I sometimes have to make these trips myself, as do you."\n\nHe took a deep inhale of the cigarette. "But enough about old times. I see you have made quite the name for yourself, you are trading all over West Russia now. This is good, your services will be needed if your... beloved tsar is to hold onto his realm."\n\nMikhail grinned; Werner's mysterious friend in Moskowien had always been his best customers.

 BRG.5157.desc:0 "Werner tipped his hat to the dead Russian river trader, blood still oozing around the wound where his nose used to be before Werner's bullet penetrated his skull. That was the last one, now nobody who knew his face still drew breath. A shame he had been forced to neutralize such good friends and long-term business partners, but at the end of the day they were Untermensch and he was an Übermensch, there could never be permanent friendship between them in the eternal struggle of the races.\n\nThe pale Volga German turned to the Russian's safe, the one the trader had unlocked a thousand times in his presence. What idiots these Slavs were, no surprise the Old Führer had declared they should be scoured from the Earth with the other unworthy.\n\nHaving stuffed his suitcase with the Russian's collection of Reichsmarks, Werner hurried to the docks. All around him the city was abuzz with war preparations, he saw marching columns, propaganda posters and worried citizens discussing a return to rationing. The time was almost nigh, and Werner smiled.\n\nAs he entered the riverboat headed down the Volga-Kama network once plowed by Werner's smugglers, he noted the crew. Six of them, four passengers. One weapon, a rifle. Captain probably had a pistol too. Pathetic. Back in the day no riverboat would travel without an armed contingent. Sign of New Russia indeed. Oh well, should be a simple enough business taking them down once they approached Moskowien. It was time to go "home," finally see that supposed paradise his fellow SS men and the Reichsführer had created in Burgund. He raised his hat to the city behind him, whispering his goodbye so the crew would not hear him."

 BRG_wolf.1.t:0 "세계계획 볼프"
 BRG_wolf.1.desc:0 "The tentacles of the Ordensstaat stretch further and further across the globe, snatching up new tools for the plan of the Reichsfurher-SS. Globalplan Wolf focuses on one of the juciest prizes of all -- the Middle East. Already our agents have infiltrated the region, and now work to disturb the colonial order, wrecking havoc on global tensions and the supply of oil. Our short term focus is on excerbating tensions between the triumvirate rivals Italy and Turkey in Syria. A confrontation there would go a long way to unleashing a beautiful cycle of violence. In the longer term, we hope to make use of the gluttony and cowardice of the Egyptian King Farouk. In time, as our agents proliferate, we may consider even loftier plans."
 BRG_wolf.1.a:0 "A place of oppurtunities."

 BRG_wolf.2.t:0 "The Kings Folly"
 BRG_wolf.2.desc:0 "It is so convenient, that although we are certainly happy to help them on their way, the untermensch are often willing to be the agents of their own demise. In Egypt, the pathetic King Farouk is well known for his lust, luxorious tastes, and disdain for his people. Our agents are already well placed to lead the King to ever more exorbitant states, wrecking havoc on his nations economy and unleashing chaos throughout the region."
 BRG_wolf.2.a:0 "And his nation will bleed."

 BRG_wolf.3.t:0 "Laying the Bait"
 BRG_wolf.3.desc:0 "In the distant Southern Deserts of the Kingdom of Egypt, the nomads wandered miserably, looking for some humble hovel to spend the night. In the many farming settlements along the Nile, the peasants worked day and night for the chance to live another year, a future for their family, and maybe a small bottle of liquor to drain their sorrows. In the narrow streets of Cairo, the cityfolk begged and stole for a living, crouching in crumbling apartments devoid of light or water, despite the promises of the government that infrastructure improvements would be coming "soon".\n\nIn the palaces of King Farouk, it was party time. Exotic dancers from across the world gyrated on poles of solid gold, whole platters of caviar were passed around hors d'oeuvres, decorated cloth bags full of Cocaine were handed out as favors. The palace was always glowing with light, thundering with muscid, and reeking of the alcoholic excess within.\n\nFarouk was never one to be surpassed, and he out-drank the hardest German beer merchants and proprietors of Mexican tequila alike, he out-snorted even the most outrageous coke-addicts, and he ate more than a dozen portly British prostitutes combined.\n\nAround the king were clustered his closest friends and dearest enablers. For every line, bottle, and plate he consumed, they pressed two more in his hands. Despite their saccharine good cheer, they did not touch the delicacies themselves -- for they were true Aryans after all. This was merely another play in the game, one that would earn them profit in smuggling money yes, but more importantly one that would bankrupt the Egyptian government and bring the whole rotten untermensch edifice crashing to the ground."
 BRG_wolf.3.a:0 "The Third Circle awaits."

 BRG_wolf.5.t:0 "The East Aflame"
 BRG_wolf.5.desc:0 "Since the first untermensch crawled out of the slime to drag the Aryan down, the Middle East has been the focal point of global conflict. Never has there been a great power that did not seek to dominate this region's resources and strategic position -- the land of black gold, the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa, the birthplace of modern religion.\n\nNow once again the region is aflame with a three way proxy conflict between the Saudis and their puppets in the Muslim Brotherhood, the Arab Nationalist Baathists, and the remnants of Italian colonialism. Each of these factions is backed by one global power or another, all are heavily armed, and thanks to our help, at the point of war. Now is the time for us to begin a general process of turning the cold war hot, and bringing an end to the long era of weakness and Aryan servitude."
 BRG_wolf.5.a:0 "The land of oppurtunity."

 BRG_wolf.6.t:0 "A Favorable Outcome"
 BRG_wolf.6.desc:0 "Once more the Ordensstaat's subtle use of lesser factions has paid off. The winner of the Iranian civil war is permeated by our agents, and indebted to our influence. In hidden places throughout the Persian mountains, our bases pump out propaganda, weapons, and recruitment. Now with a stronghold near the current focal point of global tensions, we have the ability to exacerbate the ongoing oil crisis and support the faction most amenable to our interests. Soon the great powers of the world will be drawn into an unescapable conflict over black gold, one from which they are unlikely to walk away."
 BRG_wolf.6.a:0 "A critical gateway secured."

 BRG_wolf.7.t:0 " Globalplan Wolf begins the Hunt"
 BRG_wolf.7.desc:0 "To our most noble Lord, the Reichsführer-SS: \n\nIt has come to the attention of all of our operatives coordinating our overseas clandestine operations that the Italians are enduring a new crisis, delivering to us a new chance for intervention from the Ordensstaat; in particular, "Africa Orientale Italiana," or the East African territories ruled over by the decadent Italians, has lost all decent support from their miserably inefficient government and fallen to chaos to the native savages. It would be most opportune to begin our newly drafted potential operations in the Italian menace as pertinently as possible. \n\nWith all respect and honor,\n\nSS-Obergruppenführer Heinrich Müller"
 BRG_wolf.7.a:0 "Good, very good."

 BRG_wolf.8.t:0 "Globalplan Wolf continues the Prowl"
 BRG_wolf.8.desc:0 "To the Knight of the Ordensstaat, the Reichsführer-SS: \n\nThe time has come, once more, to look towards the continuous failures and opportunities for exploitation within the most despicable traitors along the Italian Peninsula. Our current intelligence reports indicate the massive conflicts exploding out from the Middle East has caused extreme plummets in stock investments towards "Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi," the most powerful Italian oil company and, in turn, the top provider of international oil across the world. Though the world market shudders, may we toast to this most glorious collapse of Italian power? \n\nWith all admiration and resolution, \n\nSS-Obergruppenführer Heinrich Müller."
 BRG_wolf.8.a:0 "Only fools and cowards live upon that deserted Peninsula."

 BRG_wolf.100.t:0 "Growing Corruption"
 BRG_wolf.100.desc:0 "For a state such as ours, free from the cowardice and petty "democracy" of years past, corruption should be but a shadow of itself, and yet we seem to be unable to ever cleanse ourselves of it entirely. This has recently been especially true in our Middle Eastern Arab-Majority territories, where there has been a dramatic increase in embezzlement and bribe taking. It seems that nearly every low-level official has been implicated in some way, and several mid-tier beuracrauts as well. Although the highest echelons of our administration appears as surprised by this turn of events as we are, we must act quickly lest our hold over the region be rotted out from within."
 BRG_wolf.100.a:0 "Start clearing out the rot."

 BRG_wolf.101.t:0 "Terrorist Attack"
 BRG_wolf.101.desc:0 "It seems that there is no end to our troubles in the IME. No matter how many resources we throw at the region, it seems that every month brings some new terrorist attack or urban uprising. This time it was one of the former, a carefully coordinated series of explosions that killed a number of Italian soldiers and administrators, along with a heavy civilian toll. Although many different groups have claimed responsibility, the most likely true culprit is undoubtedly the Turks. In time perhaps we will be able to bring justice to these fools and sabotours, but for the mment the only thing to do is rebuild."
 BRG_wolf.101.a:0 "Damn the Turks."

 BRG_wolf.102.t:0 "Foreign Support"
 BRG_wolf.102.desc:0 "It is rare that we receive good news from the Levantine region, where every day seems to bring news of new troubles among the locals and sabre-rattling from our enemies. However, our troops have recently received an enormous shipment of weapons and equipment from allies “sympathetic” to our cause. Although the weapons are unmarked and untraceable, and there is no way to confirm the veracity of this claim, they are also of high quality deep necessity. Whoever this mysterious benefactor is, we will be greatly indebted to them should the growing tensions in the region boil over into open conflict."
 BRG_wolf.102.a:0 "We give our thanks."

Minister Sepp Dietrich has become feeble with age, and it has exposed his limits and incompetence whose failures have weakened the Ordensstaat.\n\nSuch a man can no longer be relied upon. He shall be replaced by new blood; by a man of vigor, fire, and true dedication to the Reichsführer's vision.

 BRG_novak_barbie.1.t: "Orders"
 BRG_novak_barbie.1.desc: "Klaus Barbie had always known this day would come. For years now he'd toiled and served, knowing that someday, the Reichsführer would see his worth. He'd chafed as he'd watched the Legions rebel and dissidents spread, as he knew this would have never happened under his watch.\n\nFinally, his patience had been rewarded, and he had been chosen to become the Security Minister - and the Reichsführer had come to personally give him his first assignment. Or would, eventually. It seemed the Reichsführer was late to the meeting, but Barbie was certain he was just distracted by important work. When he arrived, he would see that Barbie was fully prepared for the job. His uniform was pressed, his medals shined, and his posture impeccable.\n\nAt last, the door to the office opened, and Barbie sprang to his feet and extended his hand. "Heil, mein Reichsführer!"\n\nThe Reichsführer betrayed no emotion of course - a pure professional, even if an observer might say he didn't seem to care. He took his seat behind his desk, and got to business. "Minister Barbie, this will be short. The traitorous Legions are dealt with, and we must ensure that their rot has not spread further." The Reichsführer's eyes narrowed behind his glasses. "Your predecessor was removed for his incompetence in this matter. I trust you will not repeat his mistakes."\n\n"Of course not, my Reichsführer," Barbie hastily answered. "I assure you, all threats to the Ordensstaat will be purged."\n\nThe Reichsführer nodded once, and slid over a folder. "It is time for our work to be finished. Cleanse the Ordensstaat of the remaining rebellion and degeneracy. Do not fail me." With that, he stood again, leaving the folder of orders containing the lists of cities to be cleansed, dissidents to be hunted, and traitors to be executed."
 BRG_novak_barbie.1.a: "Barbie took the folder, and smiled."

 BRG_novak_barbie.2.t: "Liquidation"
 BRG_novak_barbie.2.desc: "The Brutalist cities were to be the places where the Ordensstaat's control was absolute. Yet unfortunately, evidence had emerged showing that even these places were not free of the rot of subversion and rebellion. Rogue elements infested it. Traitors and spies; workers sabotaging factories; opportunists stealing supplies.\n\nBarbie stood just beyond one of these cities, as grey clouds hung overhead. The SS legions stood behind him, preparing to deploy. The Reichsführer had charged him with purging all resistance to the Ordensstaat, and today that work would begin. He turned to his officers. "Tear this city apart until the dissidents are found."\n\nAt his command, the SS marched.\n\nThe factories were secured first, then the barracks, then the administrative buildings. Judgement began at the top, and incompetence would no longer be tolerated. There were none who were above suspicion of harboring treasonous elements or rebel sympathies - wittingly or otherwise. The city administrator, along with his entire staff was executed in the streets. Then the local SS commanding officers. Then the factory managers.\n\nEvery worker was lined up and questioned. Some were killed on the spot. Others were taken away for interrogation. The local SS soldiers were given a similar treatment. Once the factories and garrison were cleansed to Barbie's satisfaction, they moved to the apartments. Block by block, door to door, the SS hunted.\n\nFamilies were ripped apart as the SS dragged parents and children away, and apartment windows flashed white as gunshots sounded. It was impossible to run. It was impossible to escape. When it was done, there was no one in the city who emerged unscathed. But no one dared even whisper the name of the monster who had drowned their city in blood. They called him something else."
 BRG_novak_barbie.2.a: "They called him the Butcher."

 BRG_novak_barbie.3.t: "Inevitability"
 BRG_novak_barbie.3.desc: "He was going to die.\n\nLeon had accepted this now. Slaving in one the factories for years now, he'd seen enough to know that the only way anyone escaped was in a body bag - and those were the lucky ones. Some days he'd wondered if he had died, and he lived in hell. He didn't know if there was a difference between the two anymore.\n\nNow it had become worse.\n\nTheir quotas, already impossibly high, had been raised to even more ludicrous levels. They simply couldn't meet them. They were too weak. They were too few. The machines could literally not operate faster. The foremen didn't care.\n\nWhen they'd tried to explain, when they asked simply why their quotas had increased, they were just berated and screamed at - or shot. Their eyes were crazed by fear, and their screaming had a frantic tone. Leon understood why - if they didn't meet quota, they would suffer as well. There was only suffering in hell, not even the foremen were immune to it.\n\nThere was only one ruler of hell, and his name was Heinrich Himmler.\n\nHe was weaker than he had ever been before. He barely had strength to move anymore. Every day more workers simply keeled over and died and bodies dragged away to the furnaces. One day it would be him, and only God knew when it would be - if there was a god watching at all. Yet curiously, with that realization came a desire to control how it ended.\n\nAll of them were cornered animals in this dungeon - and if their end was inevitable, perhaps they should fight back while they still breathed."
 BRG_novak_barbie.3.a: "For this could not continue."

 BRG_novak_barbie.4.t: "Resolution"
 BRG_novak_barbie.4.desc: "It was the third patrol that week.\n\nResidents gathered uneasily in the village center as the SS departed. The SS had never treated them well, but they were a small community on the edge of Burgundy. For a long time, the SS had been more focused on problems in the cities than rural villages. Now, something had changed, and the SS had begun arriving and conducting patrols, inspections, and arrests.\n\nDozens had disappeared. From little boys, to aging grandmothers. No one knew where they had been taken, and feared the worst - and the SS was not forthcoming about their fates. But they all saw the results. So many had vanished, and they were starting to realize this wasn't going to stop. "It's over, isn't it," one man murmured. "They won. Now we're being punished." No one said anything at first, as if acknowledging this would make it real.\n\n"What can we do?" A teenage girl asked in a timid voice.\n\n"Nothing," the man closed his eyes, his voice empty. "It's hopeless now. Everyone that could do something is gone..." it seemed to be too much, and the man broke down, tears falling from his eyes as despair washed over all of the gathered - except for one.\n\n"No, it's not over," another man said, an older one with a patchy beard. A low anger colored his tone, no trace of despair to be found. He rested a hand on the man's shoulder. "We've endured long enough. We cannot - will not - go to this slaughter willingly." He looked at the rest of the small gathering. "We have nothing to lose now - and death is better than this."\n\nOne by one, those gathered nodded, and with the SS long gone, plotted long into the night, preparing for when they would return next."
 BRG_novak_barbie.4.a: "Despair to fury."

 BRG_novak_barbie.5.t: "Triumph"
 BRG_novak_barbie.5.desc: "At long last, the report he had been waiting for had come. It was thicker than the usual ones he received; this one a dozen pages thick. It had been delivered personally by Barbie, a testament detailing what he and his men had achieved.\n\nHimmler settled in, and started to read.\n\nAnd as he read, he smiled.\n\nThe cities had been cleansed of all dissident elements, the rural regions were being tamed, the factories were more productive than ever, and all disloyal and incompetent personnel purged. It was exceptional news, and it finally - finally - seemed like things were improving.\n\nIt had perhaps not been as smooth as he had wanted, but at long last all of the traitors that had plagued him had been removed through his will and might alone. Now, he could take a moment to breathe and enjoy this victory for a brief moment. There was still work to be done, but he knew there was nothing that stood in his way.\n\nHe set the report to the side, and leaned back in his chair. Already his mind was moving towards the next phase; perhaps a proper restart of the Globalplans to make up for lost time, or expanding the Ordanstaat's reach even further across France and the rest of Europe. He closed his eyes, feeling this was a moment of relaxation well deserved.\n\nAn explosion shook the room.\n\nHimmler jerked upwards, nearly falling out of his chair, as his eyes shot open. Disbelief ran through his mind as he tried to process the noise. That was when he realized his eyes were open, and he saw nothing."
 BRG_novak_barbie.5.a: "Nothing but the dark."

 BRG_novak_barbie.6.t: "Vengeance"
 BRG_novak_barbie.6.desc: ""What the fuck is happening!-" The foreman screamed at the frazzled engineers in the Rodomo power facility. Out of nowhere, the entire room had gone black. The power had since returned, but no one knew what was going on. All of the engineers were scrambling, trying to read the gauges and yelling about how the numbers didn't make sense.\n\n"We think-" One of them swallowed, shaking. "We think the grid is failing."\n\nThe words didn't immediately register with the foreman. "The Rodomo grid?"\n\n"No, the entire grid!" The engineer's voice was frantic. "The entire country is about to go dark!"\n\nThe foreman paled.\n\nThe lights flickered and again went dark.\n\nWhen it came back on, the Foreman began yelling, ordering them to stabilize the local power. They depended on the grid for power, and if it failed...he wasn't going to think about that yet. A scream caught his ear in the distance, and more shouting followed. It confused him at first, until it struck him like a bolt of lightning. "Status on the Rodomo camp fence!"\n\nAn engineer glanced at the monitor, and his face turned white. "Offline!" The Foreman froze; if the electric fence had gone offline, then that means the slaves-\n\nThe door was suddenly thrown open, and the victims of their abuses stormed in. Bony, starving, scarred, they clutched factory tools in their hands. The foreman saw their eyes burning with fury, and knew it was too late. Paralyzed with terror, his last sight was the wrench that slammed into his head - And the last things he heard were the screams of his crew as they were slaughtered."
 BRG_novak_barbie.6.a: "The reckoning has come."

 BRG_novak_barbie.7.t: "Judgement"
 BRG_novak_barbie.7.desc: "SS Officer Lasse rested his hands on the table, trying to hide the trembling throughout his body as he surveyed the map, upon which was scrawled with red and blue X's and circles. A radio rested nearby, the last line of communication they had and for now mercifully silent. Reports were coming in across the Ordensstaat. Nanzig, Rodomo, and Leydon had all fallen to armed revolution. Firefights were breaking out everywhere else between rebels and SS units.\n\nThe Ordensstaat was collapsing.\n\nFor hours now, he'd listened to frantic soldiers over the radio screaming they were being overrun. It didn't matter if the SS better weapons, they didn't have the manpower. Order had previously been kept through the SS Legions - and those Legions had been purged with no replacement. With the grid failure, there was no way to maintain order - not when the slaves outnumbered them.\n\nHis own orders had come in from Ost-Paris itself - they were to march on Brussels and put down the rebellion in the city by any means necessary - up to and including full liquidation of the city. The barracks was filled with the sounds of men assembling into formation, reading their weapons, and preparing for a bloody conflict. He believed they had enough men to take Brussels but...\n\nLasse looked at his men around him. No pride or duty in their eyes, only terror; they were unafraid to show it now, because they could see it in him as well. For a brief moment, he thought of how they had treated the slaves and abused them. For they were not even human, were they? That's what they'd been told. Now, as the fires raged across Burgundy, he found himself forced to confront the consequences of their treatment - consequences that had claimed many lives already.\n\nHe and his men would pay for their actions - in this life, or the next."
 BRG_novak_barbie.7.a: "The Ordensstaat burns."

 BRG_novak_barbie.8.t: "Uncertainty"
 BRG_novak_barbie.8.desc: "Himmler's hand trembled; the whiskey in the glass threatening to spill. He drank it quickly. It didn't stop the shaking.\n\nIt debased him. It sullied him. He was above consuming this poison; it was a betrayal of the spartan ideals he championed. Yet he needed it. He had no one to turn to, nothing to give him solace.\n\nHow? How could this have happened?\n\nHe poured another glass, his shaking hand spilling more whiskey on his desk that he wiped up haphazardly with a cloth. The room was too hot. Sweat covered his body, and no matter how much he wiped it away, he couldn't stop sweating. His clothes clung to his skin, and his breath came in short bursts.\n\nHe couldn't stop shaking.\n\nBurgundy remained under lockdown in a few areas yet. Control over the country had been partially reestablished - for what good it did. The factories had been torched, and it would take months to replace them. Cities had also been burned to husks. The power was still intermittent, and every so often he would be plunged into darkness.\n\nHe'd done everything right. Everything! And now this happened?\n\nHimmler closed his hand into a fist to stop the trembling. No. No, this was not over. He was going to find out what had happened and who had betrayed him in his moment of triumph. Without wasting another moment, he grabbed a paper to commission a report. He would know how the grid had failed, and what caused the subsequent breakdown. He would have his answers.\n\nAnd those who had caused this would pay dearly."
 BRG_novak_barbie.8.a: "The black sun still burns."

 BRG_novak_barbie.9.t: "Truth"
 BRG_novak_barbie.9.desc: "The report had come back, and Heinrich Himmler was horrified beyond belief. His face, already pale from decades of plotting, scheming, and murdering, became more reminiscent of paper or bone as the assistant fearfully recounted the true state of his country. His head span and his stomach turned ever more violently.\n\nThe Burgundian economy - contrary to the rosy reports Himmler always received - was in fact worse than in shambles. Even the poorest hovels in the most bombed-out African and Russian wastelands were more prosperous than Burgundy. In the decade since the destitute Germania regime had betrayed its duty to beat the subhumans into submission their pitiful excuses for countries had recovered. On the other hand, the terrified adjutant recounted, Burgundy had crashed uninterruptedly, going into a Stuka-like nosedive in recent years.\n\n"Herr Reichsführer, there is nothing left anywhere. The Order State is in an advanced state of total collapse. There's nothing left to feed the troops, still less to feed the slaves. And as for your Globalpläne, there's nothing left for them either."\n\nIt was then when he realized with a start that this meant that his noble plan to save the world would be no more.\n\nWith that he had had enough.\n\nThe aide had begun to expostulate on how few options there were available to right the ship, but Himmler got up before he could finish.\n\nThe aide, shocked into silence by Himmler's sudden movement, watched in horror as the Reichsführer-SS staggered out of the room, his face pale, clutching at his stomach."
 BRG_novak_barbie.9.a: "Then, to his abject terror, he heard his beloved leader retch"

 BRG_novak_barbie.11.t: "Reflection"
 BRG_novak_barbie.11.desc: "Hours had passed since the economic report that threw everything Himmler had known out the window was presented, but he still sat in his office, utterly shocked by the things he had heard. No amount of flung objects and broken implements had helped him cope with the pain, and now he was surrounded by a veritable mess of paper and shards.\n\nHe could not believe it. All the lies and deceit - Pohl, Degrelle, Barbie, Novak, the other assorted subhumans masquerading as Aryans - had led to the destruction of the Burgundian state, of HIS Burgundian state.\n\n"It's a horrible, unjust tragedy," Himmler muttered. "I built Burgundy with my own will, my own power. I had a perfect Aryan vision, and I would have been able to implement it had all these pathetic weaklings kept tearing it down to its current- current- feebleness!" But as he wallowed in self-pity he did not realize that the true reason Burgundy had declined could be found in his own neglected body, ridden down with mostly avoidable pain and disease.\n\nHimmler began to think about all the things he had wanted to do to save the world from itself, all the things he wanted to create, before realizing that this was actually an opportunity. Yes, an opportunity - and as he realized this, his pallor dimmed and a half smile crossed his face.\n\nThis "rebellion" might have given him the chance he needed. To wipe out all the traitors standing right in his sight, to rebuild, brick by brick, what was taken from him. He had done it once before. Who said it couldn't happen again?"
 BRG_novak_barbie.11.a: "Icarus once again takes flight"

 BRG_novak_barbie.12.t: "Weakness"
 BRG_novak_barbie.12.desc: ""Thank you, mein Reichsführer, I assure you I will not fail."\n\nAdolf Eichmann set the phone down, and smiled. It was a promotion long-overdue, but Himmler had finally seen his worth. With his impending promotion to deputy, he would have the influence he deserved - and he intended to make the most of it. There was much to be done in the Ordensstaat, and the Reichsführer had already given him work to do.\n\nFiles and reports were stacked in front of him, one which he now dutifully went through. Yet as he did so, he could only despair at the state of the nation. It was a mess; incompetence was visible at every single turn. The economy was non-existent, rebel groups were springing up by the day, the citizens were starving, and the power could fail again at any point.\n\nThe more he read, the more disgusted he grew. Himmler could blame degeneracy and incompetence all he wanted, but everything pointed to rot that had been festering for a very long time. He knew how things worked - there was only one man who made the final decisions in the Ordensstaat.\n\nAll he could do was shake his head. He had run the Globalplan Department for years. He had exploited the decadent superpowers of the world. He had done all of this without ever losing control, proving his competence to both the Ordensstaat and National Socialism. Himmler? All he saw was a failed state, led by a weak man. Himmler may have built it, but his chance had come - and he had failed. The results spoke for themselves.\n\nTreasonous thoughts these were, but the evidence was in front of him - which he had no intention of ignoring. Himmler was a failure for many reasons, and one was that he denied the truth before his eyes. Eichmann, however, was not so blind. No, there was only one way this weakness would be purged from the state."
 BRG_novak_barbie.12.a: "And it was when the man in charge was gone."

 BRG_novak_barbie.13.t: "Phoenix"
 BRG_novak_barbie.13.desc: ""Yes? Duly noted. Thank you." Albert Eriksson put down the phone, and exhaled. His promotion to head of Internal Security was something monumental. Not official yet, but Himmler's secretary had promised it would be soon. He'd wondered if this was coming, but he hadn't allowed himself to hope or break the mask he'd maintained for years. Not yet.\n\nBy all rights, as a Fleming, the most he should expect was subservience. He was not of the "master race", but had remained loyal all the same. And while Himmler's "loyal" Aryans had failed and betrayed him, he had never given the Reichsführer reason to doubt. It had been a long game he'd played. He had endured scorn and mockery from his countrymen. But he had bided his time, enduring DeGrelle's idiocy, and remaining in the shadows, while slavishly professing his loyalty - all sacrifices to an uncertain future.\n\nIt had been a long, painful road, but - finally - his loyalty had been rewarded. All the same, he couldn't become complacent.\n\nIt would do no good to overplay his hand. He had to keep up the facade just a little longer. He had waited years, and would not squander it due to impatience. The Ordensstaat's days were numbered - and it would fall. But like a phoenix, Flanders would rise from its ashes. A nation of true National Socialism - one purged of Himmler's incompetence, and obsessions with mysticism.\n\nIt would not be the Flanders of old. It would be something greater.\n\nEriksson idly withdrew a bottle of wine from his safe. It was a memento from the Charlemagne raid, one he'd been saving for a special occasion - and if this wasn't such an occasion, he didn't know what was. He felt a pang of regret that he could not share this moment with his men, but the charade only needed to be maintained a just while longer."
 BRG_novak_barbie.13.a: "He popped the bottle, and gave a silent toast to the future."

 BRG_novak_barbie.14.t: "Condemned"
 BRG_novak_barbie.14.desc: "Eriksson kept his face impassive as the men filed into the room. He looked at the faces of everyone else. Barbie, Novak, the foriegn minister Schellenberg, he could tell they were lying to themselves; trying to convince themselves that their service would spare them from the Reichsführer's petty wrath. His position may be secure, but they were not so fortunate.\n\nAs Himmler entered, Eriksson wondered if it had been the stress of the past days - or if Himmler had always looked this pathetic. Sweat soaked his skin, dark circles were under his eyes, his posture was slouched, and his voice seemed raspy and trembling. He knew he wasn't the only one who noted how utterly defeated Himmler looked as he began speaking.\n\nThe Reichsführer's voice was almost halting at first, but soon grew angry. He screamed at how everything had gone wrong, ranted about how he had built the Ordensstaat himself. How he had endured treason and incompetence. Seeing him this unhinged would have struck fear into them once, yet Eriksson couldn't see Himmler as anything but what he truly was.\n\nAn awkward, old, and sad man who had lost his hold on reality.\n\n"I have said enough," Himmler muttered, seeming to slump as the energy left him. "Eichmann, Eriksson. Only two you have remained steadfast and loyal. The rest..." his eyes narrowed at the others seated. "You have failed me for the last time, and shall be punished appropriately."\n\nThe gathered men took their death sentence in stride. SS Officers entered the room to take them away while the condemned stood, faces impassive and pale. Barbie visibly swallowed, but stood straight and firm as he was led out. The others were less composed, but none fought back. As the men were led out, he met Eichmann's eyes, and no words needed to be said. The final obstacles had been removed."
 BRG_novak_barbie.14.a: "There was no one to stop them now."

 BRG_novak_barbie.15.t: "Understanding"
 BRG_novak_barbie.15.desc: "Eriksson had expected the lunch with Eichmann to be a necessary, but boring affair - and it had started that way. The new deputy had droned on about statistics and numbers for a solid half hour, but had now gone quiet. The only sound that filled the air was the quiet clinking of silverware, and Eriksson finally noticed something off about his demeanor.\n\n"How much longer do you think he has?"\n\nEriksson's eyes widened, surprised that Eichmann was asking. Before he could manage an answer, Eichmann lifted a hand. "Relax. No one's bothered to check if the bugs I removed are still there." He glanced upwards, thoughtfully. "Personally, I give him ten years, maybe-"\n\n"Five."\n\nEichmann raised an eyebrow, but nodded. "I've seen some of the doctor's reports. Exaggerated beyond belief. He can barely attend meetings anymore, let alone manage the Ordensstaat."\n\n"A disgrace," Eriksson shook his head. "Himmler may have built the foundation of Burgundy, but he can no longer lead it. Someone else must take up the mantle of National Socialism. Someone capable and strong."\n\nEichmann's lips pulled back knowingly. "On that, we agree." He stood, with Eriksson joining him. "Thank you, Albert - we will need to do this again." As both men walked towards the door, all said and unsaid was clear between them. The Reichsführer remained, but his power faded each day to them until only a shadow was left.\n\nWhile the power was divided, it was all in their hands. Aligned, but not allies, they knew that a nation of perfected National Socialism could only have one leader. Who it would be had yet to be determined - but both men knew one thing for certain."
 BRG_novak_barbie.15.a: "That man would not be Heinrich Himmler."

 BRG_ai_collapse.1.desc: "TOP SECRET | EYES ONLY\n\nTO ALL MEMBERS OF THE [getGermanIntelAgencyCaps]\n\nSUB: IMMINENT COLLAPSE OF THE SS-ORDENSSTAAT BURGUND\n\n1. SUMMARY: Within the past twenty-four hours, we have confirmed that the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is currently engaged in a protracted insurrection and facing imminent state collapse. We have high confidence in this assessment due to extensive interviews from refugees, captured SS spies, and our own internal agents.\n\n2. This has occurred due to Reichsführer-SS HEINRICH HIMMLER losing control of the native SS Legions, specifically SS-CHARLEMAGNE and SS-WALLOON. Himmler has devoted the majority of his forces to pacifying the rebellious legions, while steadily losing control of his cities which are facing additional insurrections and riots facilitated by the decentralized French resistance.\n\n3. We have high confidence that Ost-Paris has lost control of a significant number of nuclear facilities and warheads, though likely retain access to a small number. It is almost certain they lack the capability to directly strike Germania due to the ongoing insurrection, and facilities and warheads falling under resistance or Legion control.\n\n4. For these reasons it is RECOMMENDED that Germany begin preparations for an immediate intervention to preclude a full state collapse of the Ordensstaat and reduce the chance for cross-border instability. We estimate that the necessary preparations would take no longer than ninety days and when concluded, neither Himmler's forces or the SS Legions would be capable of successfully defending against an intervention.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."

 BRG_ai_collapse.102.desc: "TOP SECRET | EYES ONLY\n\nTO ALL MEMBERS OF THE [getGermanIntelAgencyCaps]\n\nSUB: THE DETERMINATION OF THE FRENCH LANDS\n\nSUMMARY: As preparations for the invasion of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund continue, it is prudent to determine what will be done with the Burgundian lands once they are returned to our control. While the French State is not participating in this decision, it is necessary to consider the political impacts and opportunities of redrawing borders.\n\nThe most simple solution is a full restoration of French borders, either to the French State, under conditions dictated by the Reich, or a Paktkommission in the case of a non-compliant France. There would be pieces of Burgundy, namely the Dutch speaking region of Flanders which would also be returned to the Netherlands under this proposal. This would almost certainly be viewed positively by the international community, and ensure the support of France and the Dutch for the Reich.\n\nThe alternative is returning only a majority of the lands to the French, while the remainder of Burgundian territory will be annexed along the borders finalized in World War II plans that outline the restoration of the historical borders of the Holy Roman Empire. This would bring parts of Burgundy under our direct control, and allow us to reclaim the Germanic peoples' historical fontier - but may be viewed negatively by France and the international community.\n\nThis decision should be made prior to our operation to ensure a swift and smooth transition of authority once the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is under control, and the traitor Himmler dealt with.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"

They have additionally formally requested to assist us in the pacification of the Ordensstaat, with the expectation that their former lands that were seized by the Ordensstaat will be returned.\n\nIt is highly recommended that we accept their offer, and utilize the French military forces and officers in the planning of our intended invasion of the Ordensstaat. Burgundy is currently unable to effectively protect itself from the west, and opening an additional front on the south will render any sustainable defense impossible.\n\nIn addition to the military advantages, permitting the French to strike against their greatest enemy in the past decade will ensure the continued loyalty of the French State to Germany for the immediate future. It is unlikely that we would be able to effectively manage the former French State lands due to existing resistance organizations and the devastation of SS policies, which will limit border instability as a result.\n\nUpon the direction of the Führer, we will begin coordinations with the French State to accomplish this.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"

SUMMARY: Following the commencement of military operations against the former SS-Ordensstaat Burgund and the native SS Legions, we have successfully gained control of the former Ordensstaat, including all major population centers, military bases, nuclear facilities, and other critical infrastructure.\n\n2. The French State provided significant military support to the operation and allowed the opening of an additional front against the collapsing Ordensstaat that neither Himmler nor the SS Legions were able to protect against. French officials proved especially effective in calming the local populations and restoring order.\n\n3. Our forces located former Reichsführer-SS HEINRICH HIMMLER, who barricaded himself within a bunker, and initiated an operation to storm it. After an initial firefight, the bunker was raided, and the body of Himmler located. The body lacked any exterior wounds or signs of a struggle, indicating that Himmler took his own life rather than face capture and execution. His body is being processed for autopsy.\n\n4. With the end of the last remnants of the SS traitors exterminated, the matter of the land itself remains to be finalized. Per our agreement with the French State, we will return the lands they previously possessed prior to the illegal Burgundian annexation. Germany will retain the territory originally allocated to Himmler. These agreements will be formalized in the coming days.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."

 BRG_ai_collapse.4.desc: "DEPARTMENT OF STATE | URGENT REPORT\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The state controlled by Heinrich Himmler, officially referred to as the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, is undergoing a civil war believed to be between Himmler's SS, native SS Legions, and the French Resistance. While the situation remains fluid, a CIA analysis indicates that Burgundy has limited to no control of its nuclear arsenal, and will be incapable of utilizing them in a military intervention.\n\nWhile publicly aligned, Himmler quietly broke ties with Germany in the German Civil War, and considers the German Reich as insufficiently devoted to National Socialism and has almost certainly conducted operations against them. Germany views Himmler as a traitor, and has similarly pursued measures short of open conflict due to the nuclear capabilities of Burgundy.\n\nIn response to the ongoing conflict in Burgundy, German forces are mobilizing ground forces along the German-Burgundian border, indicating preparations for a direct military intervention. The French State has also begun positioning their forces on the French-Burgundian border, and have formally requested military assistance in retaking the territory illegally annexed by Burgundy, as well as supporting the Red Poppy Resistance.\n\nThis opportunity should not be understated. We have the ability not only to assist our ally in reclaiming their rightful land, but eliminate one of the most dangerous rogue states in the world, bring an end to Heinrich Himmler, and deny Germany an important victory.\n\nAt the direction of the President, we shall commence the operation, and end Burgundy once and for all."

First reports of civil war, then rumors of a German invasion, then America had backed France's intervention, and now...\n\nNow everyone was hoping Burgundy didn't trigger another world war.\n\nSoldiers were everywhere, and multiple networks were reporting from both American and German lines, all in clearly labeled PRESS gear. The air was tense, even after the agreement. She could see the Germans fortifying their positions in the distance, and wanted to move somewhere safer - but the people needed to see this.\n\nAt a signal from her cameraman, she began. "I am speaking from the city of Paris, just recently liberated from the SS State of Burgundy, formerly under the control of Heinrich Himmler. French and American forces have nominally secured the city, and France's former lands have been reclaimed."\n\nShe cleared her throat. "Both German and American forces intervened in the conflict, and just hours ago agreed to withdraw to pre-approved borders, which has nominally returned the majority of French lands. Germany has established lines along their historical territories based on those of the Holy Roman Empire."\n\nSamantha motioned behind her. "I am now in front of one of the front lines, where soldiers on each side are preparing for the possibility of confrontation. While both Germania and Washington have released statements emphasizing deescalation, the tension here is very real, and right now neither side seems prepared to depart. Officials are preparing to conduct high-level talks, but for now, all we can do is wait - and hope - that there are no escalations.""

Paris was supposedly safe, but with soldiers patrolling everywhere, it remained to be seen if the truce with the Americans would hold.\n\nIt worried him. He saw the American lines, the helicopters, artillery, tanks, and convoys. This was more than just assisting an ally - this was a message. A show of force to their greatest rival. Most would say it was a threat.\n\nThe Americans knew exactly what they were doing when they'd also decided to intervene. By the time Germania had learned of the Americans intervention, German soldiers were already engaged against Burgundy. It would have been risky and pointless to reorient themselves towards the Americans.\n\nThere was a tenuous peace established when the Ordensstaat lay destroyed, but everyone knew what this could lead to. The Americans were betting that Germany would be unwilling to start a war over the aftermath - and they were probably right. He couldn't see Germany risking a war over the old French lands, but if they wanted more...\n\nHe wasn't sure how far the Americans would push. The Americans were an impure and degenerate people - but no sane man wanted a war between nuclear powers. "Sir!" An aide rushed towards him, a letter in hand. "Message from Germania!"\n\nThiel swallowed, and took it, bracing himself for what would be. It was either going to be permission to open negotiations - or orders to evacuate.

 BRG_ai_collapse.7.desc: "DEPARTMENT OF STATE | URGENT REPORT\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Following the establishment of respective lines of control, we have received a request from the Senior Negotiator of the Auswärtiges Amt who is currently in Paris, requesting talks to facilitate a formal agreement to deescalate and reduce tensions along the French-German border.\n\nGermany's seeming desire for deescalation implies that they would be receptive to a permanent solution if one was offered, one which includes the recognition of the sovereign French lands, in return for recognizing their claims derived from the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. Germany is likely to strongly oppose sharing a border with an OFN member, even if they convert the former Burgundian territory they control into a buffer state. They will almost certainly demand assurances that OFN forces not enter France, which they know we will not agree to.\n\nA proposed compromise is a total demilitarization of the French-Burgundian border. We have moderate confidence in this prediction because Germany is primarily driven by protecting their sovereign territory, and this removes the potential for OFN forces on their western border. France has indicated their acceptance of this compromise.\n\nThe alternative is that we refuse the offer and maintain our forces along the shared border. It is unlikely that Germany is willing to start a war due to these actions, but this decision would significantly increase tensions and lead to accidents that could snowball out of control.\n\nDirection from the President is required to proceed."

Initial proposals such as the withdrawal of all American forces or joint French-German management of the former Burgundian territories were rejected and the first round of talks ended. The second round of talks has since been initiated.\n\n2. We made our demands to the American negotiators clear - Germany would not allow for the possibility of France to share a border with the Reich. America similarly indicated that they would accept no agreement which prevented OFN - specifically American - forces from moving through the French State.\n\n3. The United States returned for the second round of negotiations with a proposal that would completely demilitarize the French-Burgundian border. There would be no exceptions to this proposal, even the French, who have signaled their support for this proposal.The United States views this as a compromise, arguing that each of our demands is fulfilled.\n\n4. The United States has maintained that they wish to reduce tensions, but will not do so without a guarantee of freedom of movement and French sovereignty. In the event that this proposal is refused, it is unlikely that the United States would enter into an open conflict, but it would significantly increase tensions, and escalate the chance of an accidental escalation.

"Germans left in a huff, our own people did the same. It's not hit the media yet, but I've been told Washington is going to blame the Germans. I'm expecting they'll do the same."\n\nThe air was still as they processed the implications. Anderson hadn't actually thought they'd ever be in this situation; on the brink of another conflict. One of the officers finally spoke: "Will there be war?"\n\n"God willing, no," Harper shook his head. "The Germans don't want war, neither do we - but the brass is preparing all the same. We're being put on the highest alert, and have orders to evacuate the remaining civilians. If things go bad..." he trailed off.\n\nThe pause only lasted a moment, as his voice hardened and he looked each of them in the eye. "Do not engage the Germans. You only have permission to engage if they're launching a coordinated attack. I don't want to start a world war because some idiot German private accidentally fired his weapon and we were overzealous in response. Is that understood?"\n\n"Yes sir!" They barked. After a few more words, they were dismissed, and each departed to prepare their men. And as they did so, their hearts were heavy, and many would be writing letters, and making calls home, knowing they might be their last.

Several dozen news outlets and journalists in ballistic vests and wearing helmets were milling outside of the building where the Germans and Americans were holding talks that could trigger a new war. Soldiers were numerous, even as the Americans and Germans stayed apart from each other, with the French acting as the unspoken mediating force.\n\nThe talks had gone on for hours, and it was the last scheduled day. There were only so many ways it could end. They'd have to hold another round of talks, they'd say they had an agreement - or the talks would end altogether.\n\nThe doors opened and the American and German diplomats walked out.\n\nCameras flashed and every camera turned on them as the leading negotiators approached the podium that had been set up. The American negotiator spoke first. "The United States has come to an agreement with the Greater German Reich. They have agreed to recognize the return of French lands."\n\nAt this, the French media and the soldiers - with no shortage of Americans, cheered, with some of the soldiers hugging each other. The American diplomat allowed a small smile before continuing. "The United States also recognizes the German claims of the Burgundian lands that were previously the territory of the Holy Roman Empire."\n\nThat news was received less enthusiastically, but considering the alternative, people were happy enough with it. "We have agreed that the border between the French State and the German Reich will be fully demilitarized," the negotiator continued. "In the coming hours the United States will begin withdrawing forces, as with the German Reich." With that, he stepped back to let the German negotiator take the stand.

SUMMARY: German forces have seized control of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, and confirmed the final surrender or annihilation of hostile SS or Resistance forces. While the former Reichsführer-SS HEINRICH HIMMLER attempted to slow our advance and activate nuclear contingencies, we were able to secure all critical nuclear and civilian infrastructure, thwarting his last desperate efforts.\n\n2. All major population centers are under direct German military control, with checkpoints and curfews established. Numerous SS soldiers are in custody, and task forces have been mobilized to hunt down the remnants.\n\n3. The civilian population is in very poor shape. A significant majority have clear marks of physical abuse, are malnourished and suffering psychological issues. The majority of the civilian population are not properly adhering to established curfews and restrictions. The current population views us with growing suspicion, and their initial charitable perception of us is rapidly deteriorating.\n\n4. Our operations have also shifted to counter-insurgency as the French resistance movement has gained significant strength with the Ordensstaat's collapse and continued their own violent insurgency. In addition to an immediate influx of supplies and food to stabilize the population, we will require dedicated anti-insurgency teams to use if we wish to maintain a long-term presence.

SUMMARY: Since the successful capture of the former SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, the situation has continued to remain highly volatile, and there are a number of indicators that signal increased volatility or violence if not immediately addressed.\n\n2. There has been little success in halting the continued insurgency of the French Resistance, which is known as the RED POPPY. They have continued to employ violence, and have strong support within the French community who actively shelter, support, and assist them. We currently lack the manpower or local support to effectively counter their operations.\n\n3. The population has continued to grow hostile to our presence. While they consider us better than the Ordensstaat, they are increasingly unwilling to accept long-term German occupation. Multiple riots have broken out in major cities, and we have identified cells of insurgents in all major cities who are supported and supplied by the Red Poppy.\n\n4. We judge that attempting to occupy these lands long-term is unsustainable without significant investment. We propose an alternative solution, which is to return the former French lands to the French State in exchange for officially rejoining the Einheitspakt. The French population would likely view this positively, and France is almost certainly looking to have their lands returned.

 BRG_ai_collapse.13.desc: "EYES ONLY | THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE\n\nSUMMARY: Germany has secured control over Burgundy, and has begun managing the land and population. Despite this military victory, clandestine and press reports have implied that Germany is facing difficulties with the local population and native resistance movements. Germania appears unwilling to provide additional manpower and resources to occupy the lands, which has likely driven their outreach to us.\n\nGerman representatives have officially reached out to us to make a deal. They are willing to return the illegally annexed French lands, though will retain control over the former Burgundian lands that fell within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. In return, they have demanded that we formally rejoin the Einheitspakt.\n\nIt is almost certain that Germany has judged it is in their interests to cede territory that is currently experiencing unrest, famine, and resistance for us to manage instead of them. While we would regain our rightful lands, we will also be inheriting a damaged state with our own limited resources.\n\nWe are uncertain we would be able to successfully negotiate with the French Resistance if we join the Einheitspakt, as they may view us as collaborators. There is a strong risk that joining the Einheitspakt would delegitimize us in the eyes of a population which wants nothing to do with Germany.\n\nIt is unlikely that Germany is willing to invest the necessary resources in the land, and that the unrest and resistance will continue to worsen. Because of this, the situation may become unsustainable and they may return later and remove the demand to join the Einheitspakt. While this is not certain, if we wish to retain a measure of autonomy, it may be in our interest to reject this deal. This decision must ultimately rest with the President."

That French government officials walked together with German counterparts, and escorted by both German and French soldiers was perhaps an odd sight, but considering the context, everyone could accept it. To most, it didn't ultimately matter how it had happened - what mattered was that France was reunited, and they could begin healing from the trauma Burgundy had inflicted.\n\nThere were speeches given by the French officials celebrating the return to their home. They thanked the Germans for what they had done, and formally announced their intention to rejoin the Einheitspakt which was received with moderate applause. Few among the citizens cared about the implications of the decision, at least not in this moment of revelry.\n\nStill, there were others who thoughtfully observed as the celebrations stretched into the night. Ones who pondered what would happen now that France was subsumed under the political and economic dominance of the German Reich. Perhaps such had been inevitable, and there would be many debates in the coming days if such a decision had been correct - but those were for a later time.\n\nThat night was the night of return - and tomorrow everyone would turn their minds to the arduous task of rebuilding the nation to her former glory. It would be long, difficult, and painful - but each Frenchman was prepared and committed to the mission. They could all breathe easy now, as for the first time, they could close their eyes, and know that the black sun would never rise again."

The aide seemed to be bracing himself to be yelled at as he handed Thiel a letter. "It's a long response. The condition to join the Pakt was too much, it appears."\n\nThiel took the letter, now more baffled than anything else, and he dismissed the aide with a wave of his hand. That had not been the response he'd expected. Hell, it was commonly believed in diplomatic circles that the French were going to rejoin the Pakt, it was just a matter of time. This was a golden opportunity for France,, and they had just...refused. That struck him as utterly bizarre.\n\nNonetheless, the letter made it very clear what it was really about. They had correctly assessed that Germany was trying to pass the volatile French lands to them, as well as trying to bring France firmly into their political and economic sphere. A lesser issue was that they seemed to think that Germany had no right to hold their lands at all, and should return it - no strings attached.\n\nSavvy. They were hedging their bets to some degree - which was rather bold of them. Unfortunately for them, there were contingencies. France taking back the lands was the easiest solution, but it was by no means their only one.\n\nIt seemed they were going to have to do this the hard way, whether Germania wanted it or not. Setting up a new government wasn't going to be an easy task, but at this point, it seemed they didn't have any other options. However, if the French wanted to call their bluff... well, he would oblige them."

German forces marched through each of the cities that the mad traitor had built; through death camps and abominations that no man who entered came out the same. Having taken a tour of one of them himself, he would not look at the SS or a camp the same way again.\n\nHe shook his head. Freeing the people from the camps was one thing, figuring out what to do with them was another. Much of the land had belonged to France proper, but simply returning it to them was impossible since the French had made the very foolish choice of aligning with Italy.\n\nAn Italian puppet on their western border was unacceptable to Germania.\n\nSo Germany had all of this land, with a population that - while grateful for being liberated - was not going to be exactly tolerant with prolonged German control over them - and Germany didn't have the manpower, willingness or resources to sustain an occupation indefinitely. Already the resistance that had plagued the Ordensstaat was turning their ire towards Germany.\n\nNegotiations were taking place to find French and Belgium collaborators who would be willing to manage the new states, which the people would hopefully be more willing to accept. Considering that they had lived under Himmler, Lasse had a feeling that just being governed by one of their countrymen was already an improvement.\n\nThe decisions were likely to come soon. And no matter what, all of them could rest easy knowing that the infamous Shadow State was gone."

 BRG_ai_collapse.17.t: "No Better Options"
 BRG_ai_collapse.17.desc: "The rest of Germany - and indeed, most of the word - celebrated the fall of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. For Adolf Heusinger, he had moved past the celebratory stage after having a long call directly from Germania. Himmler was dead and his traitorous fiefdom was destroyed. That was good. What was not good was that they now had to manage all of the former Burgundian lands, deal with a starved and battered population, a thoroughly ruined industry and a stripped land.\n\nGermany simply did not have the resources to properly manage all of this. They had their own problems and citizens. Not to mention that while the people were glad the Ordensstaat destroyed, they were not going to accept another German occupation so soon, and the resistance that had plagued Himmler was still out there.\n\nIdeally, the French State would have taken over their former lands. Unfortunately, ever since the French State had collapsed, they were not in a position to assist. Leaving the former Burgundian lands unattended was out of the question, so it fell to the Reich to clean up the mess.\n\nSpecifically, it fell to him.\n\nHeusinger sighed as he thought of the enormity of the task before him. Overseeing the Pakt Mandate of France was going to be a challenge, even with the eventual goal of turning it over to a reliable French collaborator in the future. Yes, that might be the approach to take to placate the population. This was only a temporary measure; just until the right person could be found.\n\nHe sat up straight in his chair, and spent the rest of the evening poring over after-action reports and details of potential collaborators. There was a lot of work to do, and he found some irony in the fact that even though Himmler was dead, his legacy would drain them for years to come."

Of even survival.\n\nNow he walked the streets of Paris to cheering crowds.\n\nHenri Grouès was unused to this level of attention - much less all of it being for him. He'd spoken to countless people throughout the day all the same. He'd been thanked by countrymen from all across France, soldiers saluted him when he walked by, and he'd shaken the hands of generals and the President himself.\n\nHe'd been unsure if the French government, when all was said and done, would be willing to integrate the Red Poppy back into France. They weren't exactly politically aligned with the government after all. But they were all French, and in the end, that was what mattered. They would debate the politics of the country another day.\n\nToday was a day of solidarity and celebration.\n\nHenri walked in the parade through Paris,the men and women who'd fought with him to liberate the land beside him, while the sun beamed upon them. He waved to the people, and smiled as he saw the excited faces of children. It had been a dark and deadly road, but he felt he could breathe now.\n\nToday, they stood victorious.
