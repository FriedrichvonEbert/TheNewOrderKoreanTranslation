 POLITICS_TSAR_MIKHAIL_DESC:0 "미하일 안드레예비치 로마노프 왕자는 베르사유에서 태어나 스코틀랜드에서 자랐고 런던에서 공부했으며 2차 세계대전 동안에는 오스트레일리아에서 왕립 해군 소속으로 참전했습니다. 조국으로 돌아갈 수 있을지도 모른다는 실낱같은 희망이 나치가 승리를 거두면서 절대로 이룰 수 없는 꿈이 되어 버렸고, 독일은 서둘러 전쟁이 끝난 이후 모스코빈 국가판무관부를 수립했습니다. 결국 미하알 왕자는 오스트레일리아에서 평범한 시민으로 정착했고, 별로 주목받지 않는 항공 기술자로 살아갔습니다.\n\n하얼빈에서 초대장이 날아오기 전까지는 말이죠.\n\n백계 러시아인 몇명과 가졌던 저녁 파티에서 시작한 조촐한 모임은 점차 커졌고 어느새 미하일은 군사적 모험과 파벌 싸움, 중상모략과 스텝 평원의 전투를 망라하는 거대한 소용돌이를 일으키는 인물이 되어 있었습니다. 뒤이어 그는 시베리아 도시 치타에서 아타만 세묘노프가 이끄는 백군 장군들에게 추대되어 왕관을 쓰기에 이르렀습니다. (그의 부모님이 귀천상혼을 했기 때문에 러시아 왕위를 주장할 권한이 없다는 사실은 완전히 무시되었습니다.) 새로 즉위한 차르 미하일 2세는 이제 동부의 한때 동맹이었던 적인 콘스탄틴 로자예프스키의 파시스트 군벌과 북부의 적군 군벌들, 남부의 일본 괴뢰정부들과 서부의 소비에트 독재자의 후계국가 사이에 끼어 있습니다. 말할 필요도 없이, 지금 처한 상황이 최선의 상태는 아닙니다. 하지만 그는 이 힘든 상황을 헤쳐나가기로 굳게 마음을 먹었으며, 가령 장군들이 그에게 뭔가 결심하도록 만든 것이 있다면 그것 뿐입니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHEPUNOV_DESC:0 "보리스 니콜라예비치 셰푸노프는 타협을 모르는 남자입니다.\n\n엄격한 볼셰비키 반대파였던 그는 적백내전 중 그리고리 세묘노프와 싸우고 위대한 아타만의 평생 동료이자 제자가 되었고 트란스바이칼 함락 후 하얼빈으로 망명했습니다.\n\n하얼빈에서 백군에 대한 물자 및 정치적 후원자를 찾다가 일본이 지지하는 러시아 망명부서의 직책을 수락하면서 일본의 이익에 긴밀하게 협력하기 시작했습니다. 거기서 그는 소비에트 연방에 버금갈 훈련 과정 조직에 기여했고, 소련을 물리치는데 도움이 될 만한걸 찾고자 희망했습니다.\n\n연방이 무너지고 2차 세계대전에서 독일과 추축국이 승리하면서 그는 기회가 왔다고 생각했습니다. 얼마 지나지 않아 세묘노프 및 옛 제자들과 함께 로마노프 왕자를 하얼빈으로 유인하기 위한 음모를 꾸몄습니다. 음모가 성공하고 미하일 2세를 극동의 '꼭두각시 차르'로 옹립한 것은 백군의 대의를 정당화 하는데 많은 기여를 했지만, 파시스트와의 동맹이 무너지면서 영광스러운 전진에 대한 꿈은 산산조각나버렸고, 그저그런 러시아 군벌에 지나지 않았습니다.\n\n그러나 극동이 통합되고 아타만이 죽으면서 마침내 그는 동시베리아에서 가장 중요한 군 인사가 될 수 있었고, 미하일에게 힘을 실어주려는 충성파의 음모가 무너지면서 정치력도 확보하게 되었습니다.\n\n제국의 꿈을 되살리기 위해선 또 다른 인물이 필요하다는걸 알고 있지만, 일단은 섭정 통치에 만족하고 있습니다. 셰푸노프는 그를 과소평가하고 무시한 사람들에게 그 행동이 얼마나 어리석었는지 가르쳐주고 있습니다."

 POLITICS_NIKITA_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "니키타 알렉산드로비치 로마노프, 미하일 2세의 삼촌이자 모든 러시아인의 차르는 니키타 1세로 옹립된 꼭두각시입니다.\n\n그는 이 사실을 알고 있습니다. 장관들도 알고 있습니다. 끈을 단단히 쥐고있는 장군들은 가장 확실히 알고 있습니다.\n\n그럼에도 불구하고 그는 만족합니다. 옛 제국의 쇠퇴기에 태어난 그는 젊은 시절 간신히 친척들과 같은 운명을 모면할 수 있었고 이를 잘 기억하고 있습니다. 처음에 파리에 정착한 그는 옥스퍼드에서 계속 교육을 받았고, 결혼해서 아이를 낳고 가능한 한 최선을 다해 삶을 살았습니다. 그러나 단 한번도 가문의 땅을 잊지 않았고, 1920년대와 30년대 동안 망명 왕족 사회에서 매우 활발히 활동했습니다. 제 2차 세계대전 당시 처음엔 소련의 붕괴를 기쁘게 지켜봤지만, 국가판무관부가 설치되고 뒤이어 군벌 간 잔혹한 내전이 벌어지면서 러시아의 군주주의는 사라졌다고 확신했습니다.\n\n하지만 이후 치타의 초대를 받았습니다. 옛 백군 장교들이 조카 미하일을 '차르'로 옹립했다는 소식을 듣고 온가족을 이끌고 냉혹한 시베리아 도시로 날아가 정치적 임명을 희망했습니다. 그곳에서 그는 두 가지를 발견했습니다. 하나는 실망이고, 다른 하나는 아타만의 죽음 이후 가장 강력한 보리스 셰푸노프라는 '친구'였습니다. 그러나 미하일이 손을 지나치게 놀리자 모든 것이 바뀌었습니다. 니키타는 구체적인 내용까진 모르지만, 미하일이 호주로 영원히 떠나버렸고 셰푸노프가 그를 차르로 발탁했다는건 알고 있습니다.\n\n사실 니키타는 권력을 갖고 싶어합니다. 그러나 미하일에게 무슨일이 일어났는지 보았습니다. 셰푸노프와 군부에게 서명해주는 것이 러시아에 대한 꿈과 로마노프 권좌를 되찾게 해준다면, 그는 그냥 그렇게 하는것에 만족합니다."

Although Nikolay Alexandrovich entered Petrograd University, he did not graduate because of the outbreak of war with Germany, enrolling in Nikolaev Cavalry School instead. Graduating in 1917, he took part in the war as part of the 5th Uhlan Regiment until 1918, when he joined the war effort of the Whites in the Russian Civil War.\n\nServing initially as a personal adjutant to Colonel Stepanov, commander of White forces in Kazan, Ukhtomsky would go on to participate in battles along the Urals until the end of 1919. By 1920, the fortunes of the war were decisively against the Whites, and Ukhtomsky fled from Krasnoyarsk to Harbin, leaving in 1922 for Germany.\n\nSeven years later, in 1929, he returned to Harbin and began to engage in journalism, in which he heavily opposed the Bolsheviks and communism and called for the restoration of the White movement. These efforts, as well as his aristocratic background and monarchist views, brought him close to Semyonov, and when Semyonov left Harbin to finally begin the restoration of the Tsar, Ukhtomsky went with him to aid his efforts.§!"

 ### General Bios ###
 MILITARY_GRIGORY_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "§LGrigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov, the infamous Ataman of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, has spent nearly his entire life fighting the forces of Bolshevism, and he sees no reason to stop any time soon. Born in Transbaikal, Semyonov was once viewed with some skepticism thanks to his mixed Buryat heritage. After giving a good account of himself in World War 1, Semyonov was sent back to his homeland to put together a division of Buryat volunteers. It wasn't long, however, before he was facing down the barrel of the October Revolution. Semyonov wasted no time rallying his forces for rebellion against the Bolshevik regime, and what followed was years of brutal guerilla warfare against the Red Army in the Far East.\n\nEventually, however, he and his forces were pushed back across the Manchurian border, and Semyonov moved operations to Harbin. It was here he got into contact with countless other White exiles such as Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian Fascist Party, and the pro-Japanese "Asano Brigade". When the Soviet Union finally collapsed under the pressure of German invasion, Semyonov and his White allies saw their chance. They lured Mikhail Andreevich to Harbin in the hopes they could use him as a source of legitimacy, and marched beyond the Amur to reclaim what they perceived to be rightfully theirs.\n\nAfter carving out fiefdoms of their own from the carcass of Genrikh Yagoda's crumbling empire, the White factions split along ideological lines. Now Semyonov and his ragtag force of Cossacks and White paramilitaries find themselves isolated in their old stronghold in Chita. The old Ataman still hopes to one day finish his herculean quest to take Russia back from the brink, but his advanced age has begun to creep up on him...§!"

 MILITARY_LEONID_MUSTAFIN_DESC:0 "§LBorn in 1914 near the city of Chita, Leonid Nikolayevich came from the large Mustafin family, which fled to Manchuria in 1922. Unable to receive a regular education due to the relative poverty of his family, he grew up in Changchun and worked from an early age. Joining the ROVS in 1933, Leonid became a surveillance agent for the border police, before becoming a combat instructor, and finally a clerk at BREM.\n\nJoining the army of Manchukuo in 1938, he quickly became a sergeant-major of a communications unit, and graduated from a course to become a commissioned officer in 1943. Training with Cossacks in that same year, he was made a platoon commander and then an adjutant, finally becoming a Lieutenant in 1944 and earning a position as a headquarters clerk. His final promotion in the army of Manchukuo was to Major, and over the course of his service he received several awards from his superiors.\n\nSeen as wiser than his older brother, he is not as devoted to Shepunov as Vissarion, although he respects him and served as an enforcer in his security forces back in Harbin. When Shepunov followed Semyonov to retake Russia and restore the Tsar, Leonid dutifully followed.§!"

 MILITARY_VISSARION_MUSTAFIN_DESC:0 "§LBorn in 1910 near the city of Irkutsk, Vissarion Nikolayevich came from the large Mustafin family, which fled to Manchuria in 1922. Unable to receive a regular education due to the relative poverty of his family, he grew up in Changchun and began to work as a teenager, first at an arms factory in Mukden, then a gas station, and finally as a border police officer before at last finding employment at BREM.\n\nAfter receiving some education he joined the army of Manchukuo and became a sergeant-major before graduating from a course to become a commissioned officer, eventually becoming a Major and receiving several awards from the government of Manchukuo.\n\nA protege of Shepunov since the early 30s, he was one of the first to serve in his security force, acting as Shepunov's much feared chief enforcer, causing Vissarion to be viewed by many as dull and violent, especially when compared to his younger brother. When Shepunov chose to follow Semyonov back into Russia, Vissarion was right behind him as always, and has continued serving him in Chita ever since.§!"

 MILITARY_NIKOLAY_KOSSOV_DESC:0 "§LBorn in 1908 in Kiev, Nikolay Borisovich Kossov has had a wildly successful military career. He moved with his family to Manchuria in 1918, in the midst of the Russian Civil War. Growing up in Harbin, he served in the military of the old Fengtian Clique, rising to become an officer even before the overthrow of Zhang Xueliang by the Japanese.\n\nAfter the establishment of Manchukuo, he only became more prominent, becoming head of military transportation in a district of Manchukuo, then chief of the Russian counterintelligence unit of the 4th army of Manchukuo, before finally helping lead a cavalry division into the battles of Khalkhin Gol, after which he became a member of the general staff. Becoming a leading officer at the headquarters of the 4th military district, he received a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he also became the chief military instructor of Russian emigrants in Harbin, and received his final promotion in the army of Manchukuo in 1945, to Colonel. When Semyonov at last left to reclaim Russia, Kossov was one of the many who followed. During his time in Harbin, Kossov mastered several languages in addition to Russian, including English, German, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\nHe is known for being generally supportive of Japanese interests and has many useful connections over in Manchuria, though this causes him to be distrusted by some.§!"

 WCH_the_true_heirs_of_harbin_desc:0 "When the Bolsheviks overthrew Alexander Kerensky's unlawful government in the October Revolution, they threw Russia into chaos. The White Army, ourselves included, fought them bravely and for years before being forced to retreat. Keeping the belief of a Tsarist restoration alive, we relocated to the Manchurian city of Harbin and formed both a government-in-exile as well as an unlikely (but necessary) alliance with the Russian Fascist Party.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in the face of Nazi onslaught we seized our chance and, with Tsar Mikhail II, moved to take our rightful place. But the fascists betrayed us, stopping our advance and splitting our territory. They claim legitimacy, but they have none. With the leadership of Grigoriy Semyonov and his ever-loyal generals, true patriots of Mother Russia, we will defeat them and prove that we are clearly the true heirs of Harbin."

 WCH_civilian_investments:0 "The Tsar's Investments"
 WCH_civilian_investments_desc:0 "What is an empire without a military? And what is a military without a civilian industry to act as its support, producing anything and everything, from combat rations to supplies needed for logistical support and beyond. Our empire will eventually span the entirety of Russia, and right now we will need to ensure that a precedent is set for the establishment of the Tsar's investments into domestic, civilian industries - not just to support our ever-hungry military, of course, but to guarantee that our state will not repeat the mistakes of the past and ensure that every Russian - from the wealthiest residents of our glittering cities to the poorest of the villages - are taken care of and given the opportunity to earn luxury."

 WCH_mining_knowledge:0 "Siberian Resources"
 WCH_mining_knowledge_desc:0 "Siberia is so frequently portrayed as a vast, unsettled wilderness, covered in marshy swamps and frozen tundras. While this assessment isn't inherently false - it tends to obscure the material value of the land that we currently occupy. Its value isn't what's on top of the earth that we stand on - but instead what's underneath. The region has a large amount of resources that we can exploit, such as silver and copper, for both personal use and export.\n\nMost importantly, however, the paramount resource that any Siberian statelet could covet - coal. Coal is used to power our hungry factories, allowing them to consistently pump out the goods that we need to survive and thrive. We need to invest in the extraction of these resources for the benefit of our state and our economy."

 WCH_Military_investments:0 "The Military's Addendum"
 WCH_Military_investments_desc:0 "No empire is formed, and no empire endures, without a strong military. Without us. Ataman Semyonov, having led us on the long journey to Chita, understands this implicitly. But we find ourselves weakened by budget cuts imposed upon us by the civilians. This is intolerable. Dangerous.\n\nWe have submitted an addendum to the budget currently under review which, if accepted, will ensure that we get the resources we need to prepare for the fights ahead. All we need to do is meet with the Tsar and convince him of the addendum's importance. Without it, the state will not endure."

 WCH_import_industrial_expertise:0 "Contact the Reform Bureaucrats"
 WCH_import_industrial_expertise_desc:0 "It's the sad truth that our industrial body is severely lacking in any sort of expertise or veterancy. Any technical or industrial experts that Chita once harboured were either killed in the decades of strife or fled, apparently anywhere but here. But without those well-versed in industrial management and development, how will we be able to ensure an effective and efficient development of our industry? Clearly, outside help is needed. Many of the White officials, despite residing in Chita, still have significant connections in Harbin and, by extension, Manchuria as a whole. It may be best for us to contact Manchuria's reform bureaucrats - those who had been put in charge of the miraculous industrialization of their state - to see if they have any resources or manpower to spare. Sure, there may be a cost in acquiring their expertise, but surely it's worth it."

 WCH_connecting_chita:0 "The Imperial Transport Commission"
 WCH_connecting_chita_desc:0 "Siberia is, to put it lightly, vast and ill-connected. For many of our soldiers, weeks-long marches are required to get from one place to another, and it's often worse for the peasantry living in the towns and villages within our domain. The economic inefficiencies caused by the logistical issues presented to our administration are simply unacceptable, especially in light of the conflicts that lay just beyond the horizon. We must found the Imperial Transport Commission, headed by the most experienced of our White émigré friends of course, which will be tasked with the connecting of all the towns and major villages within our statelet."

 WCH_industrial_machinery_deal:0 "Import Industrial Machinery"
 WCH_industrial_machinery_deal_desc:0 "Our industrial equipment is, to put it diplomatically, terrible. Other, more couth members of our administration have said even truer things about its state. The reality is that most of the equipment that we have in our factories is inherited from the Soviets, and almost all of it is decrepit at best and completely unusable at worst. But you can't make new machines without, well, working machines.\n\nAnd so, we must begin to search for ways to import industrial machinery, for the sole purpose of kick starting our own domestic and civilian sectors - perhaps our old friends in Manchuria can help out. This will not only ensure that we have an operable industrial economy going forward, but that our factories will be able to effectively churn out weaponry and supplies for our soldiers."

 WCH_examining_the_force:0 "The Officers' Requests"
 WCH_examining_the_force_desc:0 "Any good military needs a well-motivated officer corps. We can promise them glory for the future, but for the moment we need to promise them money. They are woefully underpaid and underequipped, but those they lead are much worse off. They are requesting funds - not to line their own pockets but to provide proper equipment to those they command.\n\nTheir requests are noble and just, and surely the Tsar cannot but see the wisdom in ensuring that his loyal soldiers are properly equipped before they bravely face his many enemies. Consequently, funds for this purpose will be added to our budgetary requests."

 WCH_examine_our_artillery:0 "A Modern Artillery Corps"
 WCH_examine_our_artillery_desc:0 "Two world wars have conclusively proven the superiority of artillery on the battlefield as a significant force multiplier, and this is one of the few principles that our older and younger officers both agree upon.\n\nHowever, the artillery we possess is both few in number and antique in manufacture. It may be expensive, but if we invest in a new and modern artillery corps, using our own customized designs and organization, we can ensure that we have the best artillery in Siberia!"

 WCH_new_infrastructure:0 "The Imperial Prospector Corps"
 WCH_new_infrastructure_desc:0 "More copper, more iron, more coal... more, more more! The current production quotas aren't nearly enough to keep up with the rapid - no, exponential - industrial growth that we're witnessing. Without the resources to support the massive increase of factories that we're looking at, well... perish the thought. Mikhail, at the behest of the brightest economists of Chita, has declared the formation of the Imperial Prospector Corps, an organization that will be dedicated to the searching out of mineral deposits within our borders and begin their exploitation. Progress comes at a cost, certainly, and the IPC is well aware of that. But in a place as wild as Siberia, Mother Nature can take a backseat to progress in order to ensure the prosperity of the Tsar's subjects."

 WCH_public_works_company:0 "The Imperial Development Company"
 WCH_public_works_company_desc:0 "In the darkest days of the anarchy that reigned in Siberia following the concrete establishment of our state centered in Chita, unemployment was rampant and many turned into transient workers, often without a home. While things are looking brighter now than they were then, our civilian sector is still suffering.\n\nThus, a number of our prominent economists have proposed founding an Imperial Development Company, a state-run corporation that is put in charge of and sponsors public works projects - organizing them to give people employment and further develop our crippled civilian industry. The reorganization of our civilian sector is paramount to ensure that our state has a functioning economy during the wars of reunification that are ahead."

 WCH_industrialization:0 "An Industrial Empire"
 WCH_industrialization_desc:0 "With no shortage of assistance from the Imperial Development Company and the Imperial Transport Commission, the industry of Chita, the heart of the White Movement, has gone from terminal to roaring in the matter of months, it seems. As our industry and output get stronger, we continue to construct more factories in an ever-increasing cycle of industrialization.\n\nBut we shouldn't stop here - this industrial growth is only a small step towards our goal - a fully industrialized state spanning from the Pacific to the Baltic. Nonetheless, the models for growth that we have constructed and tested in the area of Chita, and their general success, will act as examples for what we can do in the future. But for now: there is no rest for the brave worker."

 WCH_war_resources:0 "Strategic Resources Extraction"
 WCH_war_resources_desc:0 "While the industrial equipment that we received from Manchuria and abroad helped revive our civilian industry and allowed us to actually operate the factories that we currently possess, sadly, it's not enough for us to expand our resource extraction campaigns. The Imperial Development Company, as effective as it has been so far, seems to be a bottomless pit of demanding further resource allocation to ensure a continued development schedule, and one of the most pressing demands that their administration has come to us with is the implementation of further resource extraction. Thus, we must take on a domestic effort to improve our industrial equipment, as it has now become possible, so that we can take full advantage of the natural resources afforded to us by the bounty of Siberia!"

 WCH_reclamation_act:0 "The Reclamation Act"
 WCH_reclamation_act_desc:0 "Our small enclave has many things - an ever-dedicated officer corps, the best troops that can be conscripted, and factories that belch out refined, industrial goods day in and out. What we are lacking, however, is usable, arable land. Sadly, apart from the city of Chita and a few other mentionable towns and villages, most of the land that is controlled by the Emperor of All Russia and his administration is completely unusable.\n\nVast tracts of marshes and forests so thick that a man could barely pass through the trees. After a wise suggestion whispered into the ear of the Tsar himself, Mikhail II has declared the implementation of the Reclamation Act, a law that puts the Imperial Development Company in charge of clearing unusable land to transform it into tracts of earth that could be used for anything from low-yield farming to training grounds for our troops. Anything's better than the squalid backwaters that the IDC has been tasked with clearing."

 WCH_importing_rifles:0 "Import Japanese Surplus"
 WCH_importing_rifles_desc:0 "The Tsar is told that our industry, fledgling as it may be, works day and night to produce the best equipment for our soldiers. This is a polite fiction. In truth, we do not have the capacity to produce enough rifles, cannons, ammunition for the soldiers we have, let alone those we want to recruit.\n\nDuring the years we spent in Harbin, we made excellent use of equipment given to us by the Japanese. Manchukuo is just across the Argun, and we still have many connections there. Importing a small amount of the vast stockpiles of Japanese arms scattered around the country should prove a simple task."

 WCH_artillery_imports:0 "Support Artillery Investments"
 WCH_artillery_imports_desc:0 "Our officers' plan to modernize our artillery is close to fruition. Working together, our older and younger officers have rapidly developed a detailed plan to completely overhaul our army's artillery in both doctrine and design. All that's left is to obtain the Tsar's approval.\n\nTsar Mikhail knows how critical the military is, and how much we've done, how much blood we've shed, for him. He won't refuse us. He can't."

 WCH_specialist_training:0 "Specialist Training"
 WCH_specialist_training_desc:0 "Modern warfare is dominated by the specialist - the soldier who both trained in and experienced with tasks that no ordinary soldier would be capable of. We are surrounded by enemies, but the Tsar can be assured that our triumph can be guaranteed by transforming our soldiers into an army of specialists.\n\nTraining relating to command decentralization, behind-the-lines operation, sabotage, and much more will be worked into our soldiers' regular training regimens. In this way, we can say that we will never be caught unprepared."

 WCH_the_Far_East_Finest:0 "The Far East's Finest"
 WCH_the_Far_East_Finest_desc:0 "Our military is Siberian, and very few of our soldiers and younger officers have spent time west of the Urals. But this is a strength - if they can survive and thrive here, of all places, they can do so anywhere!\n\nIf we incorporate their knowledge and values into our standard training, we can transform our collection of conscripts, émigrés, and vagrants into the Far East's Finest, a disciplined force seemingly invulnerable to the cold and capable of remaining organized in even the worst of weather. The Tsar wouldn't want it any other way, we're sure of it."

 WCH_the_Tsars_own_division:0 "Imperial Guard Divisions"
 WCH_the_Tsars_own_division_desc:0 "Colloquially, our army is often referred to as 'The Tsar's Finest,' a nickname intended to give pride to the many peasant conscripts making up our forces. But some officers have proposed making the nickname a reality, concentrating a handpicked group of the most loyal, most experienced, and most physically fit soldiers together in specialized units.\n\nThe old Tsars had their Imperial Guard, elite infantry that could not only handle any task but also inspire others to greatness. It is only natural that Tsar Mikhail, the rightful Emperor, has his own."

 WCH_the_tsar_combined_arms:0 "A Unified Doctrine"
 WCH_the_tsar_combined_arms_desc:0 "One of our greatest military struggles is the constant disagreement and infighting between our officers regarding operational doctrine. Older generals cling to the grand battleplans of the Great War, while younger officers propose concepts of combined arms. This paralyzes progress, and can no longer be overlooked.\n\nA decision defining the future of our armed forces must be made. We will hold a conference, including both the oldest and most innovative officers, and presided over by the Tsar. With the eyes of their monarch upon them, they will finally decide upon a unified doctrine."

 WCH_true_modern_warfare:0 "Modern Warfare"
 WCH_true_modern_warfare_desc:0 "While distasteful, we must acknowledge that the Bolsheviks demonstrated innovations in modern warfare. Their application of it against the Germans might have been ineffective, but it nonetheless set a standard for warfare across the vast expanses of Russia.\n\nWar has changed, and it's clear that we need to invest in the mechanization and motorization of our army so as to ensure that our soldiers are well equipped for the realities of Siberian combat, regardless of the protests of some of our older officers. Our empire cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of its predecessors - backwards thinking is to be discouraged at all costs."

 WCH_stabilize_budget:0 "Making Our Play"
 WCH_stabilize_budget_desc:0 "With our civilian industry taken care of and growing, our borders secured with defense schemes in place, and the military's pressing needs attended to, we can finally look outwards and begin the process of finishing what should have been done years ago - the systematic destruction of the Russian Fascist Party and its thugs.\n\nNow is the time - we can capitalize on their squabbling, destroy the Party, and recover the territory that we worked so hard to conquer when the Union collapsed. The Bolsheviks couldn't destroy us, and neither could the fascist betrayal. Now that we're able, we can finally display the strength and endurance of the true White Movement!"

 WCH_Western_defence_scheme:0 "Western Defence Scheme: Chita"
 WCH_Western_defence_scheme_desc:0 "The city of Chita, over four decades ago, was the capital of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, where Ataman Semyonov had made his last stand as the final hope for defeating Bolshevism in the Far East. Now, it is once again our hope for restoring the Tsar to his rightful place in the nation, and the Army must take careful steps to defend its holdings.\n\nThe provisional capital of the monarchy is situated dangerously close to the frontier where our control ends. We have no other choice but to protect it, and thus the High Command has suggested the construction of fortifications and the design of new plans to ensure Chita will not fall. West and north of the city, additional garrisons will be placed and new defensive lines will be formed. As our headquarters, it is the first place where our overhaul of defenses will begin."

 WCH_western_defence_scheme2:0 "Western Defense Scheme: Ulety"
 WCH_western_defence_scheme2_desc:0 "If one was to follow the road leading out of Chita and heading southwest, just before they cross into communist-held lands, they would come across the small settlement of Ulety. Initially nothing more than a normal village, Ulety earned the attention of the Tsarist generals as the final outpost controlled by them in the west. A small military base has been built, where soldiers guard the principal road before it enters hostile territory.\n\nAs part of the "Western Defense Scheme" endorsed by most of the Tsar's generals and approved by His Majesty, Ulety will be reinforced, as everyone understands that it is a crucial choke point for any invader. By building a new, larger outpost there, we can help ensure the safety of our warlord state and hopefully stall any possible enemy from the west before they reach Chita."

 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme:0 "Eastern Defense Scheme: Srednyaya Olekma"
 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme_desc:0 "On the bank of the river Olyokma, as it enters Transbaikal, rests the small town of Srednyaya Olekma, which could be considered our greatest base in the northeast. It has proven crucial in maintaining a line of defense against Rodzaevsky's fascists and the Aldan clique, and continues to be a checkpoint the Tsarist Army uses to exert its authority in the northeast, as well as stop occasional raids by hostile warlords or simple bandit groups.\n\nA reinforcement will be required if we look to expand into the fascist-held lands and secure our flank to the north at the same time. As it is the only town we hold in the region, it must become a stronghold against any army."

 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme2:0 "Eastern Defense Scheme: Tupik"
 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme2_desc:0 "South of the city of Srednyaya Olekma, where we last focused our efforts on backing up the garrison, Tupik is yet another village saved by anarchy or oppression by the arrival of the White Army. Since we prepare for the very real possibility of war with Rodzaevsky, known as the "Vozhd" of Amur, the Eastern Defense Scheme has begun, and Tupik is a key part of that. By significantly reinforcing the settlement, we can end the constant raids in its surroundings, and build yet another strong defensive point near the frontier.\n\nThe situation in Tupik is considered different by many in the government, though, as the village is tiny and there are no pre-existing military installations there.

Amazar has had the luck to not only be included in the dozens of towns the railway passes through, but also just barely escape the grip of Rodzaevsky.\n\nAs both an important railway junction and the last camp to the east, we must take great care in protecting the town.

Rodzaevsky has traditionally been considered incredibly brutal, but his recent actions have proven that he is clearly unhinged and acting well past the bounds of civility. This barbarism and the crimes he has committed against the Russian people must end - the sooner the better.

The party's imagery and symbolism was everywhere - clearly the mad "Vozhd" had wanted to emulate Hitler himself. From swastikas to large banners and anti-Jewish propaganda, the RFP's former capital of Zeya was lousy with the party's symbolism. But that cannot not stand. Mikhail aptly suggested "toppling the pedestal", a process aimed at tearing down the RFP's propaganda and teaching the people that they no longer live under a reign of terror.

They know that our administration would be immensely preferable to a resurgent Soviet Union, and even if their strategy would be to supply us in a futile attempt to keep Russia divided, we will take all the help that we can get. Assault rifles, artillery pieces, trucks, or even bullets. Whatever they're willing to sell, we're willing to buy.

Rumor has it that Matkovsky's been searching for foreign recognition and aid, even going so far as to positioning himself as a moderate candidate in the Far East. This cannot be allowed to continue - for right now the demand for foreign aid means that even the smallest amount could be the tipping point in the battle between the Heirs of Harbin.

By promising amnesty to those who know the locations of these caches, we can have them bring us to them and dig them up - like how guilty murderers would bring the authorities to where they stashed bodies.

However, that didn't stop the pragmatic fascist from looking to other means to bolster his ranks. A number of mercenary companies were hired, and while we did best them in battle, they're now stuck in frigid Siberia, with no master and no money. This situation presents both a danger and an opportunity - leaving them unemployed could result in disaster, a full-on revolt of professional soldiers that we simply cannot afford at the moment.

The first step towards this would be to deal with the nearby Yakut Republic. The republic, apart from being an anti-monarchist state, controls incredibly valuable land, ripe for material exploitation. Securing their territory would go a long way to ensure a steady export of valuable minerals, as well as an additional place to use to increase our manpower. It's probably best if we attempt to approach them first, but if that fails, the troops should be ready at their borders to prepare a "hostile takeover" of sorts.

But the question has been raised about exactly how to go about exploiting the resources that we now control - the Yakuts were running their mines with minimal efficiency, mostly because of the lack of manpower. Luckily, we have something the Yakuts don't: access to urban centers with populations of the listless unemployed and political prisoners.

If we were to assemble a group of prominent Yakut leaders, both those who were a part of the republic and those who had been marginalized by it, we could offer them political autonomy in exchange for massive economic concessions and the recognition of Mikhail II as the Tsar.

However, the Ataman's most significant contributions to the White Movement were militaristic. He had organized the first White Army during our original foray back into Siberia, and had personally coordinated the entire Harbin Front, until the fascist traitors split it and disintegrated any hope we had of securing for ourselves the whole of Russia.

Mikhail was born in France and spent his life just about everywhere but Russia. When he was kidnapped and brought to the city of Chita as a prisoner in all but name, he was forced to read speeches phonetically, frequently not even aware of what he was saying.

With the application of strict oaths of loyalty, these officers will finally be able to serve with a cause worth fighting for: ours."

After the hard-fought conquest of Central Siberia, and despite our victory, the White Army has been shown both its greatest strengths and most glaring weaknesses. We shall use the lessons of that conquest to address the issues encountered and better prepare ourselves for the future.\n\nMany say it cannot be done, that the old Whites who lead our army are stuck in the past.

To the west, our greatest foe awaits, preparing as we are for the final conflict.

 WCH.1.t:0 "The Unwilling King"
 WCH.1.desc:0 "Tsar Mikhail rose, dressed, and prepared for the meeting with his High Command. It was to take place in the "Grand Royal Palace," an extravagant title for the rather modest residence that he had been installed in.\n\nSeating himself at the head of the table, Mikhail watched as the generals and functionaries entered. Many were very advanced in age, yet were energetic and passionate, the thought of a grand reclamation of Russia by the White Army spurring them to action. Several were younger, primarily descendants of émigrés or newer recruits themselves. He had always trusted them; they were more logical and not as shackled to the distant past of the old Empire.\n\nAtaman Semyonov opened the meeting, delivering a speech on the latest developments. His hands shook, and his balance was unsteady, but his voice and eyes were crystal clear. One by one, the other generals stated their opinion and expressed their concerns. Mikhail mostly remained silent and only occasionally expressed his expected approval as the other generals expressed their opinions and concerns, his head full of thoughts of the life and wife that he had left behind in Australia.\n\nOnce the meeting was adjourned, and escorted by his personal bodyguards, Mikhail decided to walk the streets of Chita. Under freshly fallen snow, the city looked picturesque, and his "subjects," from children to old men, happily went about their lives in the surprisingly safe city. Though he was still uncomfortable in a position he had not chosen, Mikhail felt a moment of pride for this island of stability that he had been chosen as the figurehead of."
 WCH.1.a:0 "One cannot simply reject the throne."

 WCH.2.t:0 "The Death of the Ataman"
 WCH.2.desc:0 "Most unfortunate news has arrived from Chita, the capital of Russian monarchism in the Far East. Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov, known as "the Ataman," has passed away from natural causes at the age of 71. A popular figure in Chita, and a valuable ally of Tsar Mikhail, he has departed this world to join many predeceased comrades.\n\nBorn in the Transbaikal in 1890, Semyonov first distinguished himself in the old Tsar's Cossack legions during the Great War. When the Civil War began, he organized some of the first anti-Bolshevik revolutions in the Transbaikal and, with the help of both the Czechoslovak Legion and the Japanese, managed to seize both Chita and the surrounding regions. There he held out against the Soviets even as the rest of the White movement crumbled, before being forced to flee into Manchuria.\n\nDecades later, as a leader of the émigré community in Harbin, he became a leader of the Japanese-supported anti-Bolshevik front, and rose to become the indisputable chief of the military clique that crowned Michael Andreevich, taking the new Tsar to Chita upon his triumphant return to the city.\n\nAs per his wishes, the Ataman has been buried in his home village of Kuranzha. While it may be dangerously close to the frontier with the socialist revolutionaries, thousands of people, from peasants to generals, have visited to pay their respects. Even His Majesty has issued a statement, expressing his condolences. Semyonov may have left behind a troubled legacy for some, but all of Chita recognizes him as a strong and respected leader."
 WCH.2.a:0 "He defended his motherland until his final moments."

 WCH.3.t:0 "An Offer from Chita"
 WCH.3.desc:0 "Today, a series of proposals and requests have reached our foreign office with a surprising address - the city of Chita, in Russia. Currently held by the Tsarists, the pro-monarchy legacy of the Harbin movement, the city and its administration has requested of us a large degree of industrial aid in the form of factory support and spare machinery. We could agree to deal with them, theoretically, in exchange for some future favor, or we could simply reject the warlord rabble."
 WCH.3.a:0 "Sure. Always nice to pad the favor wallet."
 WCH.3.b:0 "No, reject these Tsarists. We've done enough for them."

 WCH.4.t:0 "Manchurian Industrial Aid"
 WCH.4.desc:0 "A reply to our request has come through today, sent directly from the capital of Manchuria. The reply, dripping with formality barely contained the implications that the letter hid: the subsequent industrial aid that would be provided to the Tsarists in Chita would come at a cost, and the cost would be more than just money. The Manchurians and their Japanese masters frequently dealt in favors, something that our government has already accepted as a reality. On a long enough timeline, it seems likely that they will come knocking at our front door, asking to be repaid.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, it appears as if Manchuria, likely with the permission of the Japanese, have agreed to our proposal for industrial aid. This is a fantastic win for us - while it won't necessarily help us directly legitimize our government and provide political recognition, it will however allow us to bolster our petty industrial output and shore up our manufacturing. One of the best ways to ensure our victory over our rivals is to make sure that we can put more guns in our people's hands than they can, and that's just what we intend to do with this aid."
 WCH.4.a:0 "When can we expect the first shipment?"

 WCH.5.t:0 "Manchuria Refuses to Aid Us!"
 WCH.5.desc:0 "A simple, manila letter was received today, sent by the Manchurian foreign office. It contained their response to the request that we had made of them - to attain industrial aid from Manchuria, and by extension, the Japanese, in exchange for cash. The response was a simple, single-paged letter politely declining the opportunity, but thanking the Tsarists for bringing the offer forward. The letter was promptly burned after it was reported to those who needed to know.\n\nWith the offer for industrial aid declined by the Manchurians - likely at the hands of their Japanese masters, we can expect that any further industrial development will have to be done directly by us, instead of being reliant on foreign aid. While this is certainly a setback, it's not one that's unrecoverable. That being said, there are plenty of ways for us to fund this industrial development even without the Manchurian's help. Increased taxes, the use of the military for building, and the melding of private and governmental sectors will all be useful for just that. In the meantime, while our foreign affairs office licks their wounds, we can go ahead and draw up a number of proposals for domestic industrial development."
 WCH.5.a:0 "No one tell Mikhail about this..."

 WCH.6.t:0 "Reclaiming the Wilderness"
 WCH.6.desc:0 "Exiting his lodge with a fishing rod in hand, Kiril surveyed the landscape before him. It was another beautiful, picturesque day in the unspoiled Siberian wilderness. The rest of Russia was going to hell, but as far as Kiril was concerned, this place was paradise on earth. Or at least it was, until Kiril spotted a pillar of black smoke rising from the tree line. Looking more closely, he thought he saw distant trees beginning to tumble down and flocks of birds frantically flying away. "What the hell?!" Kiril exclaimed, throwing down his rod as he ran off to investigate.\n\nWhen Kiril finally arrived at the scene, it was worse than he feared. Scores of workers in hardhats were in the process of chopping down trees by the dozens, and large construction vehicles were recklessly tearing up the ground. In the midst of all this, a foreman was directing the workers. Kiril clenched his fists as he angrily approached the foreman, unconcerned with the notion that he may be trespassing. The foreman, a grizzled, older man like Kiril, turned to face the strange man approaching him from the forest. "Who are you? What the hell do you want?"\n\n"I'm Kiril. I live back that way, and I want to know why you're tearing down my forest!" The foreman chuckled mockingly in response. "Your forest? This ain't your property, pal, we checked." Kiril was visibly unsatisfied with this answer. "This is where I come to hunt. I survive off this land! Who gave you the right to come and rip it all apart?!" The foreman sighed. "Look, we're with the Imperial Development Company. The government said we were to clear space for construction, so take it up with them and stop wasting my time!" The foreman turned away from Kiril, and he took this as his queue to leave. Kiril promptly retreated in a huff, and knew that he would be spending much of his night writing angry letters."
 WCH.6.a:0 "No land is safe from the march of progress."

 WCH.7.t:0 "War on the Horizon"
 WCH.7.desc:0 "Mikhail II stood outside the door, the crack in which allowed the voices within to be clearly heard. His generals were holding a meeting, and the Tsar felt that it would be impolite to interrupt, feeling content to remain just outside and listen.\n\nThe unmistakable voice of General Leonid Mustafin spoke first. "I'm not overly concerned by the fascist militias, but I understand Matkovsky has recruited a large mercenary force. They're experienced fighters, and could be a real problem for our soldiers."\n\nAt the general's words, which seemed to imply conflict was about to begin, Mikhail couldn't help but begin to worry. Was war really coming so soon?\n\nA second distinctive voice, that of Boris Shepunov, the Army's Chief of Staff, spoke next. "I disagree, Leonid. Mercenaries want to fight bandits, not real armies. When they see our soldiers, they'll scatter to the wind, and leave the fascists to their fate. And that rabble won't stand a chance against our forces!"\n\nMikhail felt his heart sink. His suspicions were correct, and regardless of what he might want, his little realm was going to war. He tried not to think about all the ways it could very poorly for him. Trying so hard, in fact, that he accidentally pushed the door open.\n\n"That's all well and good," said a third figure, that of General Vladimir Abramov, "but we still have no plans for the occupation of these territories. How do you propose we..." Surprised at the appearance of their sovereign, Abramov trailed off as all of the generals turned their attention to Mikhail.\n\nShepunov was the first to speak. "Your Imperial Majesty, we have exciting news!""
 WCH.7.a:0 "The pen is set aside, and the sword shall be drawn."

 WCH.8.t:0 "The Calm Before the Storm"
 WCH.8.desc:0 "For a very long time, the poorly-marked border zone between the Transbaikal Principality and the lands belonging to the Russian Fascist Party saw little traffic. That has changed. Seemingly overnight, Tsarist troops have established a formidable presence, constructing roads, ammunition depots, and more, visibly and openly preparing for armed conflict.\n\nCorporal Fedorovich was no fool. He knew that these exercises were not for show, and that his unit would soon be going into battle. He began smoking more to help calm his nerves, but couldn't shake the knowledge that he might not live to see another month. Taking a long drag, and hearing footsteps as he did so, Fedorovich raised his head and saw his squad leader.\n\n"Good morning, corporal," the sergeant said. "Got a light?" Fedorovich nodded, lighting the cigarette as asked. The sergeant looked to the east as he took a drag, past the small creek that had substituted as a border marker and towards the distant mountains. He gestured to Fedorovich. "Over that river lies a land filled with hordes of angry fascists." Fedorovich remained silent as he followed the sergeant's gaze. "I'm not going to lie, corporal, it's going to be rough. They're going to throw everything they've got at us, and we're going to take losses. There's no avoiding it, so prepare yourself while you still can, and if the time comes, make sure you take as many fascists down with you as possible."\n\nWith that, the sergeant discarded the cigarette, gave the mountains one last look, and made his way back towards the rest of the men. Fedorovich appreciated the small talk, but his anxiety hadn't waned. Death lay in wait just over the horizon, and the corporal wasn't ready to face it."
 WCH.8.a:0 "The tension is overwhelming."

 WCH.9.t:0 "The Execution of Konstantin Rodzaevsky"
 WCH.9.desc:0 "Konstantin Rodzaevsky took one last look at his surroundings. His beloved Siberia was just as beautiful as always, and his captors couldn't have picked a finer day to execute him. On the journey to his place of execution, he had shouted himself hoarse, and all that was left, radiating from every feature, was rage. It was something his executioners could no doubt see.\n\n"Konstantin Rodzaevsky, do you have any last words?" As the lead executioner spoke, Rodzaevsky returned his attention to the men who now had their rifles trained on him.\n\n"Yes. I do." His sore throat struggled to form the words. "Everything I did, I did for Russia. You can call me a monster, but soon the people will realize that only monsters have the strength to save this country. Perhaps if I had killed that decrepit bastard Semyonov and the rest of those forgotten relics back in Harbin when I had the chance, we'd find ourselves in a very different situation, yes?" The demagogue managed a pained, wheezing chuckle and stood as straight as he was able. "Go on then, make your weak Tsar proud and shoot me already."\n\nA flurry of rifle fire aptly punctuated Rodzaevsky's mocking final words, and the former fascist leader fell to his knees before pitching face-first into the blood-stained snow. With that, Rodzaevsky's movement had concluded the very way it had conducted itself all these years: with unrestrained, bitter violence."
 WCH.9.a:0 "Perhaps there is some justice in the Russian Far East."

 WCH.10.t:0 "Life Under the Tsar"
 WCH.10.desc:0 "Sofiya cautiously made her way down the sidewalk, doing her best not to draw attention to herself as she tried to get home with her groceries. It had never been safe to walk the streets of Zeya before the war, and she saw no reason why that would change now. Just a few minutes more, and her apartment would be in sight...\n\n"Excuse me, ma'am. Could I have a moment?" The voice, coming from behind, stopped Sofiya in her tracks. It had to belong to a soldier - no civilian in Zeya would stop another on the street so casually. Slowly turning around, her heart sank as her suspicions were confirmed. A young Tsarist soldier stood there, awaiting an answer. Though the uniform was different, the gun slung over his shoulder had become synonymous with oppression and abuse under the fascist regime, and she mentally prepared herself for what was to come.\n\n"Apologies, ma'am, but I saw your bag and was wondering if you knew where I could find the grocer." He smiled at her apologetically. "This town is like a maze." Taken aback by the polite nature of the soldier's request, Sofiya replied cautiously. "O-of course, it's on the corner of the intersection just ahead. Just follow the sidewalk from where I came and you can't miss it." The soldier nodded his head in response as he moved to follow her directions. "Thank you, ma'am. Carry on."\n\nAs the soldier departed, Sofiya sighed in relief and hurriedly continued towards her apartment. Such a peaceful exchange would never have happened under the fascists, who were more gangster than soldier. Sofiya was still nervous about having armed men watching her every move, but maybe things were changing for the better?"
 WCH.10.a:0 "Time will tell..."

 WCH.11.t:0 "The Question of Yakut Autonomy"
 WCH.11.desc:0 "As expected, our troops encountered minimal resistance during the "hostile takeover" of Yakutia, and the vast territory is now under the protection of both the Transbaikal Principality and the Tsar. We must now answer the question of what to do with it. Yakutia is enormous and densely forested, and our army is far too small to maintain strict control.\n\nTsar Mikhail has uncharacteristically broken his usual silence to offer a potential solution. He seems to think that compromise will ensure stability in the region, and that it would be prudent to give a certain degree of autonomy to the people of Yakutsk on the grounds that they pledge their support to us.\n\nWould promoting a friendly Yakut government be a wise move, or would it be better to directly annex the territories?"
 WCH.11.a:0 "We shall establish a loyal occupation government."
 WCH.11.b:0 "Their lands belong to us now."

 WCH.12.t:0 "Directing the Budget"
 WCH.12.desc:0 "Our young empire has limited resources, and hard choices will have to be made. We must decide which sector of our nation will receive the majority of government funding. While we could attempt to balance our efforts, such an approach risks an unacceptable dilution of effectiveness.\n\nTsar Mikhail has voiced his preference for funding the so-called Loyalists. They wish to focus on developing Chita's infrastructure and expanding its industrial base. To do this, however, much-needed funding will have to be diverted from the military, a dangerous prospect in these desperate times.\n\nIvan Mikhailov, the Minister of Finance has, together with the general staff, proposed an alternative idea. They believe that civil spending should not be our priority until the region is united, and that all funding possible should be diverted to the military until unification is achieved. Although the civilian budget will suffer in the short term, a powerful army may be necessary to secure our position."
 WCH.12.a:0 "Our civilian industry needs support."
 WCH.12.b:0 "The military, of course."

 WCH.13.t:0 "The Execution of Valery Sablin"
 WCH.13.desc:0 ""Any last words, Bolshevik?"\n\nValery Sablin, now a disheveled, defeated shell of his former appearance, looked up at his captors. Their guns were now trained on him, and there was not a doubt in Sablin's mind what they intended to do. "Speak, red! You won't get another chance!" This time, Sablin decided to humor their taunting demands. "So, this is what it has come to. The war is lost and I'm to die in this dusty basement for my trouble. It's funny, I always thought I'd be executed by the NKVD, not some Tsarist relics." Sablin attempted to stand up straight and look his executioners in the eyes. It was harder than it looked, for the would-be revolutionary was greatly weakened from his time in captivity.\n\n"You Tsarist bastards think killing me is going to end the revolution? Have you learned nothing? The people of Russia will never accept a reactionary monarch. Soon enough, they'll remember all over again why the revolution happened, and when that day comes, another will rise in my place to avenge me and the rest of my comrades. Do your worst, but know that it's going to take a lot more than killing me to crush the revolutionary spirit of the people! This isn't over, not by a-" Without warning, the impatient Tsarist executioners opened fire and prematurely ended Sablin's defiant last speech.\n\nThe force of the rifle rounds caused Sablin to fall backwards against the wall. As his body slid down to the floor, the young revolutionary drew his last breath. Sablin's execution had finally brought the socialist movement in the Russian Far East to a tragic close, and symbolically heralded the ascendancy of the White movement."
 WCH.13.a:0 "A bang and a whimper."

 WCH.14.t:0 "Tsarist Infiltrators!"
 WCH.14.desc:0 "Terrible news! Not long ago, our brave fighters on the frontlines began to report that critical supplies were going missing. Scouts were sent to investigate this matter, as it is not uncommon for our soldiers, who mostly consist of needy peasants, to skim some off the top to provide for themselves and their families. What they found was all the more troubling.\n\nThe supplies weren't being stolen, they weren't arriving in the first place! As it turns out, teams of Tsarist troops have somehow slipped past the frontlines and have established themselves behind our forces in an effort to intercept and disrupt our supply lines. Contingency plans are already being set in motion to squash this little problem, but the damage has already been done and many of our fighters are going without much-needed supplies."
 WCH.14.a:0 "They still have their faith."

 WCH.15.t:0 "The Next Step"
 WCH.15.desc:0 "Tsar Mikhail II leaned against the ornate balcony, a pensive look on his face as he looked out over the frozen town of Chita. In the room behind him, an extremely festive, and extremely loud, party celebrating "his" victory over the other warlords of the Russian Far East was well underway. Hearing footsteps behind him, Mikhail turned to see Boris Shepunov, who looked quite pleased with himself.\n\n"Mikhail!" he called, "what are you doing standing out here all alone? Come, join us!" Shaking his head, the Tsar turned back towards the balcony, and in response Shepunov advanced to stand beside him. "Mikhail," he began, "what's wrong?" The general's jovial demeanour had disappeared. "You've been so distant lately. Care to explain what's going on?"\n\nThe Tsar took a moment before responding. "Boris, now that we...now that you've won, what's going to happen to me?" Shepunov was silent for a moment. "What's going to happen? Now you're going to rule the Far East, Mikhail. Why do you think we're celebrating?"\n\nMikhail shook his head again. "I mean, what do you and your men plan to do with me?" Shepunov nodded slightly, fixing him in a glare. "Ah, I see. Even after all we've accomplished, you still want to go back to Australia, don't you? Speak!" After a long moment, Mikhail replied. "No. No, I want to stay here." A wolfish smile returned to Shepunov's face with astonishing speed. "Good. Very good." He placed a hand on Mikhail's shoulder as he turned to leave. "Your destiny is here in Russia, my liege. Never forget that." Mikhail watched as the general left, returning to the party.\n\nThe Tsar thought on Shepunov's words. Perhaps, in a way, he was right. His destiny was here, in Russia. But he was also wrong. Mikhail was a Tsar, and a Tsar is meant to lead, not follow..."

It was late at night, and he had forgone sleep to await an extremely important telephone call that he knew was coming. The air in the room was tense, the only sounds being that of the owls outside, Ukhtomsky's fingers, and the grandfather clock in the corner. Eventually the telephone rang, and Ukhtomsky sprang into action, immediately picking up the receiver.\n\n"Ukhtomsky speaking."\n\n"Did you get our telegraph?" The speaker on the other end spoke perfect Russian - but with a distinctly Japanese accent.\n\n"I did," Ukhtomsky replied, "and I want to assure you that while the government in Zeya has changed, its intentions have not. The usual contacts will continue the arrangement as-is, but they will now represent us. Is that acceptable?" There was a long pause, and Ukhtomsky struggled to keep his nervousness in check.\n\n"We had a very specific understanding with previous parties," the voice said. "Does your government intend to uphold its...particulars?"\n\n"We do. Unequivocally."\n\n"Very well. We will do the same." The speaker on the other end abruptly hung up.

For a moment, Matkosky remained silent. He tried his best to maintain his composure to preserve some small shred of dignity, but the situation made it rather difficult. "I wish to say that it was never my intention to cause harm to Russia. I only did what I thought was necessary to bring strength and unity back to this broken nation, and at the very least, I would argue that my government was a far more legitimate entity than this sham of a trial!"\n\nMatkovsky almost immediately was showered with jeers from nearly everyone present at the trial. He attempted to dodge the vegetables being thrown at him by people in the gallery, but found it difficult with the guards restraining him. One of the prosecution, who almost entirely consisted of members of Chita's general staff, used this opportunity to lash out. "Mr. Matkovsky, as I'm sure you are aware, your father died bravely fighting with us against the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. And what has his son accomplished, standing here accused as a war criminal and a fascist tyrant? Mikhail Alekseevich, you are a disgrace to your father's legacy and a disgrace to our movement. I would go so far as to declare you are undeserving of wielding the very name of Matkovsky!" Matkovsky, who was still preoccupied with the objects being hurled his way from the gallery, scoffed at this accusation.\n\n"That's ridiculous! How dare you-" Before moods could flare any further, the judge slammed his gavel several times to regain control over the court. "Order! I will have order! Now, Mikhail Alekseevich, you are charged with over ten thousand counts of murder, and 3 counts of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?" The accused's answer did not shock anyone. "Not guilty!" Before this defiance could cause any more mayhem in the court, a one hour recess was called for the court to deliberate on a sentence..."

My life has grown stranger over the years and I feel as though I have no avenue through which to vent my frustrations. You are one of the wisest men I have ever known, and I hope you can find it in you to give your foolish son good council.\n\nAs you know, I spent much of my life in Australia after serving with the Fleet Air Arm. It was one of the happiest periods of my life, and regrettably the situation has changed for the worse. Several years ago, I got an invitation from a group of Russian émigrés in Harbin to attend a banquet celebrating the legacy of the Romanov family. It seemed like a quaint affair, an opportunity to celebrate my lineage.\n\nBut instead I found myself having a crown placed atop my head in the city of Chita, deep in the Siberian wastes. As I write, I still remain in Russia many years after I left for Harbin, the Emperor of a realm I have no real interest in ruling. This place is horrible, father. I have no real power and these old Whites do not care about me or my well-being. The only thing they do care about is using my name to legitimize their barbaric wars and the atrocities that follow. If I attempt to make a decision, they look at me as though I have three eyes. This land is cold and harsh, and I miss Australia every day. I feel a deep pain in my heart when I think of the wife I left behind.\n\nYou are the only one I can think of to turn to, father. I am locked inside a golden cage in a land that is foreign to me, and I do not know what to do.

But what's done is done, and now I have no choice but to face a hell of my own making.\n\nI sincerely regret once again troubling you with my problems, but in truth I have nobody else to turn to. This land is foreign and cruel. I have no friends, only scores of villainous men who pretend to respect me in public and no doubt mock me in private. I am a living, walking joke. They call me Tsar, but everyone knows the truth. I'm a puppet, a figurehead.\n\nI'm now convinced that Russia is one of the worst places on earth. The nights are long, the winters are longer, and the people of this land are irritable and violent. I have gained newfound respect for my forefathers, who somehow managed to keep this god-forsaken frozen hell under control. 'My' armies have seen a great many victories, but I cannot share their enthusiasm. How can I? They claim to be fighting on my behalf, but this is not true. They do not fight for me, they fight for the idea I've been chosen to represent, and for the men who hold me captive.\n\nI desperately want to leave, but I cannot.

 WCH.20.t:0 "A Lonely Evening"
 WCH.20.desc:0 "The Tsar's palace was a lonely place, moreso at night. When Mikhail had first moved in, things had been different. Early sleeps turned into early mornings, and he hardly ever noticed the hugeness and the emptiness of the place. But as days turned into months that turned into years, things began to change. Late, sleepless, silent nights blended into lethargic, lonely days. More and more alcohol was brought into the palace, and everyone knew who was consuming it. He had bodyguards, sure, faceless children of émigrés - but Mikhail knew he couldn't name a single one of them.\n\nOne of these long, sleepless nights, defined by Mikhail's wonders and regret, the powerless Tsar sat in a chair, overlooking a dark window. He couldn't see out of it - the streetlight outside was damaged, and the bright lights of the palace contrasted so deeply with the black night outside that Mikhail only saw his reflection. His mind wandered often, but tonight he could only think of one thing: his father. He had never endorsed Mikhail's visit to Harbin, even begging him not to go. Mikhail had attempted to write letters to his father, many times, with nearly a dozen letters in total written. And yet, he lamented, he had never received a single response.\n\nHe had once been close to his father, but his deafening silence had further crippled Mikhail. With a glass full of liquor in his hand, he wondered why his father refused to respond. Was it to punish Mikhail for leaving? Or perhaps, had he moved and not received the letters? A dreadful thought passed through the Tsar's mind: maybe his father didn't care to respond at all. He finished the brown liquid in a single belt - the first of many, he was sure. Mikhail missed his father. He missed his home, and his family. His mind shifted to one thing: another letter."

It had been artfully enclosed within the vanilla-colored envelope, the result of masterful practice and care by the Tsar. He sighed the deep, long sigh of a man preoccupied with a momentous decision. Gently taking it from his desk, he left his quarters to find Fedor Orlov, his secretary.\n\n"Mister Orlov...?" Mikhail asked quietly as he opened the door. Orlov, sitting at his desk just outside, stood at the Tsar's entrance. "I have... one more letter for my father. He hasn't responded to the others, but I had to send one more. Would you take care of it for me?"\n\nOrlov looked at the letter, and put his hand out to receive it. But as he did, meeting the Tsar's gaze, guilt overwhelmed his features. Tears welled in the young man's eyes. "What is it, Fedor?" The Tsar asked. "Oh, my Tsar, I've done you a great injustice..." Orlov replied.\n\nOrlov proceeded to tell the Tsar his whole story: Shepunov had long been paying him to deliver Mikhail's letters to himself instead of to the post office, and on more than one occasion he had even witnessed the general burning Mikhail's letters.\n\nHearing this, Mikhail felt something he had not felt in a long time: rage. "I see, Fedor. Thank you." Mikhail did not hand the letter to Orlov. Instead, he turned, headed back into his quarters, and wasn't heard from for the rest of the day."

"It could be worse, I suppose. Most days they don't even let me leave this house."\n\nMikhailov's pace slowed. "There are many things in this land that simply do not make sense, Majesty. The military holds even more influence than you think." Mikhailov's pace slowed to a stop, and Mikhail watched with concern as the minister cast his own nervous glance around.

No matter how hard I try, there's no way out."\n\nMikhailov was stunned, the spoon slipping from his hand. "Y-your Majesty, I..."\n\n"Enough!" Mikhail roared. "I'm sick of pretending everything is fine, because it isn't. I can't even write letters to my family, did you know that? The other day I learned my secretary was delivering all my mail to Shepunov! Don't you get it?! I'm being held hostage in a country where everyone is spying on me, it's too cold, and I can't even properly speak the language!" Mikhailov was silent, his mouth agape. It was as if, for a few moments, the Tsar had become a completely different person. After a moment, Mikhail calmed. "I... I'm terribly sorry," he said. "That was rather undignified of me."\n\n"No, Your Majesty. You speak the truth. It is a sad state of affairs when even Russia's holy sovereign is nothing more than a slave to the whims of his army. You are the Tsar, the Emperor of all the Russias. The military likes to pretend that means nothing, but they have forgotten their place. You have a god-given destiny to lead, and they have a duty to follow in your wake." A long pause followed.

There was a reason he had always ordered men shot in a dark basement - it prevented people from knowing just what had happened, which therefore prevented any attribution of martyrdom.

Even through defections in their own ranks, peasant rebellions behind the lines, and truly difficult territory, they had defeated the fanatics in the field. Further, upon capturing Omolon, they had also captured their leader, the enigmatic priest Alexander Men.\n\nAt the decision of the central government, Men had been placed on trial, and the entire process had proven far more difficult than anticipated. Because Men would not speak. Not a single word. Through pretrial motions, opening statements, evidence presentation, cross-examination, and the like, he had remained entirely silent.\n\nThis was causing problems for the state as a whole. The sentiments that Men had spoken to in so much of the rural population still existed, and without any response from him, the trial increasingly looked like little more than one for show. Were he to be found guilty, as had been intended, and given appropriate punishment, he would undoubtedly be considered by many as a martyr. And that could not be permitted if stability was to be preserved.\n\nTherefore, the decision had been made and conveyed by proper means. Men was to be found guilty on some, but not all charges, and given a lengthy prison sentence. There would be unrest, but in time and as the government solidified internal control, people would forget about the priest rotting, silently if desired, in his cell.\n\nAnd at that point, the sentence could easily be extended indefinitely.

While they hardly would have been a challenging foe if they refused, many are still glad that our necessary equipment and manpower will not need to be wasted.\n\nWith Yakutia under our control, we will be ever closer to unifying the Far East. Our armies can now be sent west to Irkutsk and Buryatia, as well as far into the frigid north. Before that, however, we still need to integrate our new holdings.

Our war-hardened veterans easily outnumber them. We will want to be quick, however. We do not want to be bogged down in a long war, allowing our enemies to gain the upper hand. We will move quickly, as the Yakutsk believe they are fighting for their very survival. If only they understood we were their only option."

 WCH.42.desc:0 "There was little Vissarion Mustafin could do to disguise his surprise when his little brother, Leonid, invited him out for drinks. While they'd been close as children, they'd drifted apart since Semyonov had led them in the retaking of Chita and they'd both been distracted by their countless duties. Something was up, something that Vissarion supposed he'd find out once alcohol loosened Leonid's tongue.\n\n"Ahhh! This place really does have the best liquor in all the Far East, I'm certain of it!" Leonid exclaimed, flashing the bartender a wide grin.\n\n"Just because it tastes like water instead of fresh piss doesn't make it good." Vissarion remarked with a chuckle. Leonid rolled his eyes and playfully pushed his big brother.\n\n"Ah, you have too little faith, Vissarion! I'm telling you, I have a good feeling about the country's future. With Tsar Mikhail at the helm, and not that idiot old man, soon all the finery of the world will be around us. Liquor included, of course." Laughing heartily, Leonid did not notice the frown upon his brother's face. That line about Semyonov had sounded almost... treasonous.\n\n"Say, Leonid?" When his little brother turned to him, Vissarion continued. "Don't get yourself too involved in court politics, alright? Your good feelings are sometimes right, but so are my bad feelings, and I have a really bad feeling about the way things are going."\n\nNow Leonid frowned and furrowed his brows. "Maybe. It can't hurt to just want more from the government, though, can it? I don't want to be a Japanese dog forever. Isn't there anything you desire for the country, brother?""

 WCH_regional.1.t:0 "A Legacy to Consider"
 WCH_regional.1.desc:0 ""Presenting His Imperial Majesty Mikhail II, Emperor of All Russia!" Mikhail emerged from his entourage, coming within sight of the vast row of troops that stood before him. Upon seeing their Tsar, the men stood at attention and gave their due salutes.\n\n"Hail, Tsar Mikhail!" Despite being caught off guard by the overwhelming cry of his name, Mikhail tried his level best to maintain a dignified composure. The procedure went on as planned, as the Emperor made his way down the row exchanging handshakes and salutes. He couldn't help but notice that these young men looked at him with a great deal of admiration, as though he were a figure of divine status. One of the officers he had come to couldn't have been older than twenty.\n\n"Hail, your Imperial Majesty. It is an honor to serve you." The young officer gave a gracious salute.\n\nMikhail sheepishly went in for a handshake. "No, no. The honor is all mine. I am truly grateful for your service." The Tsar gave a slight, nervous smile. He glanced back at Boris Shepunov, who was standing behind him. The old general had his arms crossed, and his impatient expression clearly indicated that he wanted Mikhail to pick up the pace.\n\nAs the inspection concluded and the royal entourage made its way back to their transportation, Mikhail passed by a sight that had caught his eye. A large bronze statue depicting a heroic cossack warrior on horseback was prominently displayed out front of the army base. Mikhail stopped briefly to examine the bronze figure, captivated by the pose of the warrior. The Tsar imagined himself in his place, with thousands of young men looking to him for guidance in the heat of battle."

 WCH_regional.2.t:0 "Packing the Committee"
 WCH_regional.2.desc:0 "With the recent establishment of the Imperial Governing Committee to aid with the administrative matters of the empire, a mad scramble for control over the new organization has already begun. The interest groups who dominate the political scene have their eyes upon the committee, eager to pack it with their allies.\n\nFirstly are the Industrialists, who represent Loyalists. This group mostly consists of wealthy aristocrats and businessmen, and are keen to utilize the Committee to expand their business interests in the empire. Also among this group are close political allies and confidants of Tsar Mikhail II, and control over the Committee would surely mean an expansion of the crown's influence.\n\nOn the other hand, politicians and military men allied to the White Army also seek to bring the IGC under their control. The majority of these men have connections to the White Army's general staff, and by extension, Army Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov. Should the IGC fall under the military's influence, Shepunov's power would once again be cemented over matters of state.\n\nWho shall dominate the Committee?"

 WCH_regional.3.t:0 "Handing Out Grants"
 WCH_regional.3.desc:0 "The time has come to decide who shall govern the administrative divisions laid out by the Imperial Governing Committee. Minister of Finance Ivan Mikhailov and Army Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov have butted heads over this critical decision, each submitting their own plan for how the country should be governed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Shepunov's plan for allotting the grants heavily favors the military. If he were to have his way, the governors would largely consist of loyal military men. These handpicked officers will be veteran confidants of Shepunov, with some of them serving with him since the days of the Russian Civil War.\n\nIvan Mikhailov's plan, on the other hand, heavily favors Loyalists. Mikhailov believes that "Royal Governors" should be assigned the grants. These governors will be elected from amongst the civilians of the empire, rather than from the White Army.\n\nIn the end, which of these men will get their way?"
 WCH_regional.3.a:0 "The land grants will be given to the royal governors."
 WCH_regional.3.b:0 "The administrative divisions fall under the control of military governors."
 
 WCH_regional.4.t:0 "Getting Our Hands Dirty"
 WCH_regional.4.desc:0 "Boris Shepunov was not pleased. It had been several months since his armies had achieved victory over the Empire's foes, and yet, despite his best efforts, the lingering remnants of past enemies continued to find ways to become a thorn in his side. Today, he had called a meeting with the rest of the White Army's general staff to make his displeasure known.\n\n"Gentlemen, please explain to me how, after supposedly destroying our enemies, they are still out there killing our troops and giving me a headache in the process?" There was no response. No doubt, Shepunov's generals were spending the silent moment formulating excuses rather than providing answers.\n\n"I can assure you, sir, that while these insurgent actions are indeed a pain, they are nothing to be worried about." General Mustafin's tone did not exactly scream confidence. "I predict that they are too insignificant to persist for too much longer, and they will fall apart on their own given enough time..."\n\n"Pardon me, Leonid, but that's bullshit and you know it. They're out there right now killing our men and trying to undo all of the hard work we've accomplished, and you're going to sit there and tell me it's under control? Do you even have a clue what's going on?!" Silence again. Nobody wanted to be next to face their superior's wrath.\n\n"Well, it seems you fools had the audacity to claim victory without finishing the war. That ends today. I want all of you to send your best men out to start making arrests. After this week, I don't even want to hear a peep of dissent, understood? We will no longer suffer traitors on my watch.""

 WCH_regional.5.t:0 "Shoring up Support"
 WCH_regional.5.desc:0 "Trouble is brewing in the government, and the tensions between the civilian and military sectors are rapidly approaching a climax. Despite appearances, the dominance of the White Army in the affairs of state is not nearly as strong as it once was. Ever since the death of Ataman Semyonov, the military's influence has grown more tenuous by the day. Opportunistic statesmen circle like vultures, and rally around Tsar Mikhail, the one man they believe can spearhead their intentions of breaking the tight stranglehold the White Army has over the state.\n\nWith the support of a clique of young officers and the backing of Ivan Mikhailov, Mikhail conspires to seize control over the government and reaffirm his status as the absolute authority of the Russian state in both name and intent. While they have the backing of wealthy aristocrats and industrialists on their side, there are growing worries that the scheme is doomed to fail without proper support from military elements.\n\nThe White Army and their Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov, on the other hand, are aware that something is amiss. While they still do not have conclusive evidence that the Tsar is conspiring against them, they are at the very least suspicious enough to prepare for preemptive action against potential dissidents. Contingency plans are being drawn up, and the White Army remains on high alert.\n\nSooner or later, one faction will move against the other, and the destiny of the White movement shall be decided."

 WCH_regional.6.t:0 "A Small Hiccup"
 WCH_regional.6.desc:0 ""This is your final chance!" Boris Shepunov shouted, knowing that the Tsar's Honor Guard, occupying the residence's first floor, could hear him clearly. "Surrender and stand down! That is an order!" There was no response, either in word or action, and Shepunov sighed in frustration. He had hoped that the loyalists would come peacefully, and surrender the Tsar without bloodshed, but it was not to be, and now many of them would have to die. He turned to his subordinate. "General Volkogonov, you may begin."\n\nVolkogonov nodded and picked up his radio. "All units!" he commanded, "commence operation on my order!" With one final nod from Shepunov, Vinogradov gave the command. "Fire!" The soldiers, having prepared themselves in predetermined positions, obeyed, and within moments began pouring fire into the Tsar's residence.\n\nRifles and machine guns raked the windows and doors as the cannons of the armoured carriers blew holes in the walls, reducing much of the first storey to rubble. Return fire was sporadic and inaccurate, and before long, ceased entirely. A short while later, Volkogonov's soldiers stopped firing as well.\n\nExamining the scene, Volkogonov's chest tightened. He could see the twisted and mangled bodies of the Honor Guard, until only a few moments before comrades like any other, scattered amid the rubble, and those that were still alive would be crippled for life. Full of shame, but not wanting to show it to anyone, least of all Shepunov, Volkogonov turned away as his men advanced on the residence with weapons raised."

 WCH_regional.7.t:0 "End of an Era"
 WCH_regional.7.desc:0 "Boris Shepunov sternly examined the scene that lay before him. His troops had the Tsar's dacha utterly surrounded; the rats were cornered in their holes. Only a token force of Imperial Honor Guard and a few conscientious young officers stood between him and those who had conspired against the state. The old general prepared to make his intentions known.\n\n"Attention, all of those who serve the Tsar! We are here only to execute the will of the Russian state! Mikhail Andreevich has thrown his lot in with treasonous elements, and has forsaken his holy vows to protect Russia and her people. Stand down at once!" The Tsar's loyalists did not budge. Shepunov could not take their defiance any longer. "Enough of this farce. General Volkogonov, order your men to attack. This ends today."\n\n"No. I'm afraid I can't do that, sir."\n\n"What the fuck-" Turning to face his subordinate, he was met instead with the barrel of a gun. Volkogonov had his sidearm pointed directly at his face. "What... What the hell do you think you're doing, General?!" Shepunov's voice, usually stern and decisive, now bore a rarely-seen panic.\n\n"Boris Shepunov, in the name of His Imperial Majesty, Mikhail II, I am placing you under arrest." Shepunov's world was turned upside down in only a few seconds. Volkogonov's soldiers had turned their sights inwards, and began violently detaining any units present who answered to Shepunov.\n\n"You too, Volkogonov? No... This can't be..." Words had finally failed him. The Prime Minister and Commander of the White Army, formerly the most powerful man in the Empire, felt his knees give out as soldiers cuffed his hands. Almost as soon as it had begun, his iron-clad reign had come to an end."

 WCH_regional.8.desc:0 "Kiril grunted as he sat down, one of the few opportunities he had to rest after a long day of work. From this elevated position, he could see clearly the results of the day's labor. Vast ranges of landscape, deprived of trees as far as his eyes could see. In their place were stumps much like the one he was now using as a seat.\n\nHere he was, once a son of the Siberian wilderness and her natural bounties, now doing the bidding of the very men he once tried to resist. Although the pay was very good, Kiril still wondered if it was worth selling his soul and helping them to destroy forests similar to the one he once called home.\n\nAs Kiril lit a cigarette, his mind continued to wander. Siberia was a vast land, but even the seemingly endless forests of a land like this were finite in the grand scheme of things. The Imperial Development Company tore into the wilderness like a pack of wolves, ripping down forests and transforming wide tracts of wilderness into featureless plains of grass. Kiril wondered if, in the future, there would even be any forests left once the IDC was done?\n\nHe had been born and raised a man of the wilds, living off the land and appreciating what nature had to offer. Civilization was overrated as far as Kiril was concerned, and he hoped that more people would come to appreciate its beauty. The problem with this, however, was that the pay was no good. In the end, even a wild beast like Kiril was tempted by the IDC's offer of wealth.\n\nFar in the future, would Kiril's children be able to experience the same kind of life that he once did? Putting out his cigarette, Kiril ceased his thoughts and headed off to end his shift for the day."

 WCH_regional.9.desc:0 "From head to toe, Semyon's body ached. He had been working in a bauxite mine from dawn till dusk, and had only now managed to find time to regain his bearings outside that damned hole he had spent all day in. Once an officer in the NKVD, Semyon was now no better down than a slave to his captors. Certainly not the glory he had envisioned, to say the least.\n\n"Slacking off again, red?" The familiar voice made Semyon groan.\n\n"At least I know when to stop before I drive myself mad, fascist." He didn't even bother to look at who shot the snide greeting his way. The fascist, a large fellow named Anatoly, chuckled as he took a seat next to Semyon.\n\n"They intend to work us to death, you know. I've seen a few guys drop already. The guards didn't even care, they just walked past like nothing happened." Semyon had seen it too. Men too weak for hard labor with a gun to their back, collapsing hopelessly in a place with no light.\n\n"I don't know what's worse, working with dead men walking or working with fascists like you, Anatoly."\n\nThe fascist gave an empty laugh. "It doesn't matter who we were, bolshevik. All they see are bodies for the mines. We're all brothers down here, whether we like it or not."\n\nWith that, Anatoly made his way back towards the mine's entrance with his tools in hand. Deep down, Semyon knew that he spoke the truth. Part of him hoped that his former enemy would come back out of that pit alive."

 WCH_regional.10.t:0 "Not as Planned"
 WCH_regional.10.desc:0 "General Dmitry Volkogonov was growing more nervous by the second. He had promised the Tsar that he would aid him when the time came, and that moment had clearly arrived. However, as was routine in a land as dysfunctional as Russia, the reality was far more complicated than that.\n\nThe White Army must've had over a thousand troops on the field already, with plenty more on the way. Volkgonov's contingent made up a rather small portion of those present, and he found himself almost as outnumbered as the poor souls trying in vain to protect their doomed Tsar. As Boris Shepunov shouted for the Tsar's bodyguards to surrender, Volkogonov's mind drifted into dark places he would've rather avoided. Was his decision to side with Mikhail a wise one after all? What would happen if he tried to disarm his own superior with odds as hopeless as this?\n\nThe voice of his superior broke Volkogonov's introspection. "General Volkogonov, I want your men to move in. I've spent too long trying to haggle with these fools. Time to wrap this shitshow up." The general was caught like a deer in headlights. What would he say? Was this his moment? To betray the Tsar would be most dishonorable, but the alternative would surely spell his doom...\n\n"General? Have you not heard me? Get your men in gear!" Volkogonov gulped nervously. It was going to be now or never. No matter what decision he had made today, somebody was going to consider him a traitor. The only difference would be whether or not he'd survive after the fact.\n\n"Y-yes sir. All units, prepare to advance!" With that, the troops of the White Army descended upon the Tsar's residence. As he walked away from the line with the shame of it all weighing down his soul, Volkogonov could hear sporadic gunfire erupt."

 WCH_regional.11.t:0 "An Underdog's Tale"
 WCH_regional.11.desc:0 ""What the hell do we do now? Oh... I just knew this would be a disaster!" Mikhail was frantic, and on the verge of hysterics. Mikhailov, on the other hand, tried his best to remain calm, but the circumstances made it a challenging prospect indeed. Deep down, he was just as terrified as the Tsar was.\n\n"Just calm down, Your Majesty! I'll uh... we'll figure this out! I just need to think..."\n\n"What is there to think about? They know what we're up to and they have the building surrounded! If only I hadn't accepted that bloody invitation, I wouldn't be in this mess to begin with!" Mikhail's hysterical shouting only caused an inescapable feedback loop of panic amongst the two. A sudden burst of small arms fire from outside interrupted their musings, followed in short order by an ear shattering explosion that shook the entire building. Mikhail let out a rather unflattering scream as a stray bullet shattered the window he was crouched by. The two men went prone to the floor, covering their heads as the symphony of gunfire reached its crescendo.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, the guns abruptly fell silent. The heavy breathing of both Mikhail and Mikhailov were now the only sound that remained. Mikhailov was the first to rise, peeking out the shattered window to see what had happened. No luck. It was getting dark, and the smoke emitted from the fighting made it hard for the old man to see.\n\n"What's happened? Did we win?" Mikhail asked nervously, still flat on the ground. The Tsar yelped as the door to his dining room was opened. The two men turned to see General Volkogonov, flanked by White Army soldiers.\n\n"Do not be alarmed, Your Majesty. The traitors have been dealt with. You are safe.""

Despite all his meticulous preparations, it seemed that the prince had still managed to underestimate the frigid conditions of the region. Pulling his fur coat more tightly, Nikita continued his descent towards the large group of men who had gathered to greet his arrival.\n\nChief of Staff Boris Shepunov was in front of the gathering, eager to receive the prince. "Prince Nikita, your Highness! Allow me to be the first to welcome you and your family back to Russia."\n\nNikita gave a courteous smile and extended his hand to Shepunov. "Greetings, general. It's good to be back..." The prince, now flanked by his wife and two sons, Nikita and Alexander, tilted sideways to look past Shepunov and into the crowd behind him. "I say, where is my nephew? I would've liked to speak with him."\n\n"I apologize, your Highness, but His Imperial Majesty was feeling a bit under the weather today, and I'm afraid he was unable to be here. I'm sure he would've been delighted to meet with his family otherwise. Come now, let's get you and your family out of the cold." Shepunov gestured for the royals to accompany him, and they obliged.\n\nDespite what the general had said, Prince Nikita found it rather odd that his nephew was not among those who had come to greet his arrival. The prince was greatly looking forward to a reunion, and he had figured Mikhail felt the same. Whatever kind of malaise the Emperor had come under, he thought, it must've been rather severe..."

Here he was, standing inside a nondescript office in the Japanese foreign ministry's headquarters, facing an official diplomatic delegation. Vladimir was hand-picked by Boris Shepunov personally to head the White delegation to Tokyo. Although the general would never dare to question his superior's orders, there was one small hang up that he had with the idea: Abramov was a military man, and had no diplomatic experience whatsoever.\n\nHe wondered why Shepunov didn't just get the Foreign Ministry to handle it instead, but it was too late to do anything about it now. The Japanese were before him, expecting Abramov to be the face of the new Russian diplomatic mission. He knew the future of Russo-Japanese relations may hinge on the success or failure of this meeting.\n\n"In short, His Imperial Majesty wishes to look past any historical transgressions and promote a great renewal in Russo-Japanese relations. Rest assured, we approach as friends and equals." Abramov's statement sounded painfully rehearsed, and he hoped that fact was lost on the Japanese.\n\nHis Japanese counterpart turned to speak to one of his subordinates in a language the Russian delegation did not understand. The diplomat then turned back to Abramov with an unconvincing smile on his face. "Equals, you say? What an interesting perspective, to say the least. Do not worry, General, Japan is indeed open to strengthening relations. I sincerely hope that today's meeting shall be the first of many. Perhaps we will also learn a thing or two about conducting diplomacy in the process, yes?""

This was the first parade held since the reunification of the Far East, and Shepunov did not exactly hold high expectations for the display his soldiers were to put on. In the past, the White Army's troops were brigands in uniform, no better than the barbarous raiders he had seen several decades ago when he served under Ataman Semyonov.\n\nWhat he saw instead, was quite different. The troops marched in lockstep, their eyes focused upon their Tsar and their arms in salute. Their uniforms were impeccably well-maintained, and slung over their shoulders were the latest in small arms designs. Even an old White like Shepunov couldn't help but be impressed by the gallant figure the soldiers below had presented.\n\nAs the foot soldiers passed, and the famed Cossack riders came into view, Shepunov couldn't help but get emotional. After so many years, this was the army he had been trying to build. Not a ragtag collection of mounted raiders and militias, but a professional force ready to take on the world if it came to that.\n\n"Vladimir, I never thought I'd see the day when the White Army would resemble an actual military. This is simply incredible..." Shepunov's eyes were still on the riders as he spoke to General Abramov, who stood next to him.\n\nMikhail II, however, was the only man present who couldn't care less. What others saw as valiant warriors, he saw as the cold-blooded guards of his prison. The Tsar remained silent throughout the entire event, looking on in silent concern rather than admiration."

Ever since the Fascist government had been driven out of Zeya, she felt quite comfortable walking the streets again knowing that the thugs of the RFP no longer terrorized the city. That is not to say, however, that things were any less strange.\n\nAs she made her way home for the day, Sofiya noticed a small group of people gathered around the sidewalk in front of her. Their attention appeared to be focused on something attached to the side of a building. Whatever it was, it had caused quite a stir. As she drew closer, she could hear the people mumbling amongst themselves. Finally, she was able to see what exactly they were looking at.\n\nAttached to the wall was a large propaganda poster, clearly meant to advertise service in the White Army. Front and center was an idealized depiction of a fierce-looking soldier charging a two-headed dragon with his rifle in hand. The dragon was clearly an evil creature, with one head colored red and the other a deep black. Wrapped in the beast's tail was a pole bearing the tattered tricolor of Russia. Captioned in bold letters were the words "Join the White Army, and deliver holy Russia from the clutches of radicalism!". The symbolism was not lost on anyone.\n\nSofiya could not help feeling twinges of concern. While this poster was fairly benign, similarly militaristic designs would not look entirely out of place in the previous regime. Continuing her journey home, she could only hope that her relatively peaceful existence would continue even as the new regime tightened their grip."

On behalf of their divinely-chosen emperor, Mikhail II, the White Army has wrested Eastern Siberia away from the fascist and bolshevik tyrants. Now that our position is secure, we wish to obtain recognition as the legitimate government we are." This answer only raised more questions. The ambassador was going to have to call someone about this, but first he'd have to get this strange Russian out of his office...\n\n"Well, I'm afraid there's not much I can do, seeing as my job is to handle relations with Japan, but I can make some calls to the State Department on your behalf.

As usual, they only had bad news: more reports about the insurgents, who grew bolder day by day, more rumors about possible dissent from the civilian administration, and much else besides. It was all so tiresome.\n\nThe old general swiftly downed the glass, and as the vodka stung his throat, Shepunov wondered what the Ataman would've thought about everything. The old cossack always had a knack for keeping his cool, even when the situation was out of control. Now Semyonov was gone, and it was up to him to clean up the mess. The general cursed himself for believing that life would become easier after his army's accomplishments. He should've known by now that victories usually raised more questions than they answered.\n\nDeep down, Shepunov truly missed those old days in Chita, riding out with Semyonov and his cossacks on daring escapades across the Siberian tundra. There at least, he knew that his enemies would face him head on. Nowadays, they hid in plain sight. Peace had made Shepunov complacent, when what he really needed was to be more vigilant than ever.\n\nShepunov moved to refill his glass. It diverted his attention away from the weariness of the day, if only for a moment."

His two friends, however, did not seem to share the same fear.\n\n"Where's your Tsar now, Jew? You thought you could come through our part of town? We still run things around here, and no war is going to change that!" Grigor's friends, clad in distinctive, yet poorly-maintained RFP uniforms, towered over a man on the ground. They had dragged him off the street, and immediately began harassing him, just like in the old days.\n\n"I just collect the census!" the man cried. "I'm not even Jewish!" His pleas for clemency were met with a ferocious barrage of kicks.\n\nA shout rang out from behind Grigor, drawing the attention of all three of the fascists. A pair of White Army soldiers were approaching, weapons at the ready. The sight caused Grigor's stomach to turn. "Step away from him!" the lead one called, "and put your hands in the air! Now!"\n\n"Ah, the dogs of the Tsar are finally here!" barked one of Grigor's companions. "We were just having a nice chat with one of your people!"

Everything is in motion, all that remains now is to have faith in our success."\n\nMikhailov set his spoon down, and as he did so, both men noticed that it, along with all the other silverware, had begun to vibrate. From outside, a deep rumbling could be heard, and both Mikhail and Mikhailov rose in unison to investigate, their minds beginning to race.\n\nPulling aside the curtains, they were greeted with a sight that made their blood run cold. Trucks and armoured carriers disgorged dozens of soldiers with the insignia of the city garrison, and they were moving to encircle the residence. And, at the front gate, Boris Shepunov himself stood by while an enraged subordinate screamed at the guard commander.

His advisors and he had agreed, it wasn't a good look.\n\nMikhail knew a few words and phrases, of course. He could say hello and goodbye, agree and disagree with statements, and even ask for the bathroom. He even understood Russian pretty well, being able to follow the radio programs and speeches the government played. Unfortunately, his ability to produce Russian was simply lacking.\n\nIn truth, a part of him had resisted taking the time to learn the language, though, he had found himself changing recently. He had seen his subjects for who they really were. Hard working, caring, and accepting people. People who would band together to rebuild a farm after a raid, and house refugees from the east even if they didn't have the food or money to do so. People who had accepted him.\n\nAnd Mikhail had also seen exactly who would rule these lands if he were to leave. Men who would have entire villages sacked if it meant rooting out even one perceived enemy, and they all seemed to have a lot of enemies. He began to feel a resolve, a responsibility to these generous folks who had hosted him here. He was staying here for them, and every day it seemed increasingly possible he might actually end up ruler of Russia. He needed to be ready for that day.\n\nSo there he sat, paper in hand and eye on the clock, his foot tapping as he pondered the people of Chita. Suddenly, he heard the door click and a man come in.

Some of you are politicians who seek only to represent their constituents to the best of their abilities. A few of you are officers of the White Army, the very same force that once bravely defied the Soviet usurpers so long ago."\n\n"Despite these very stark contrasts between you all, you've all come here united behind a singular purpose: to take back our country from the selfish and corrupt generals who seek to transform this ancient and glorious empire into nothing more than a quasi-fascist stratocracy, with me as their helpless puppet."\n\n"I am speaking, of course, of Prime Minister Boris Shepunov.

Despite our differences, we will fight side-by-side to remove this aspiring tyrant from our midst and continue the journey towards reunification.

You've seen for yourself all the reports of Bolsheviks in our midst, waiting for their moment to strike back; strike at you.

"Oh, there you are! You had us worried sick, Your Majesty!"\n\n"Shit!" he muttered as one of his guards finally came into view, his flashlight still focused on Mikhail's location. Thinking fast, the Tsar leapt from the fence and into the shrubbery below. The landing was hardly pleasant, but adequately cushioned by the foliage. Lifting his head from the bushes, however, Mikhail was immediately met with three more soldiers.\n\nThe guard in front spoke first, and he did not sound amused.

Close members of his inner circle of friends and contacts have informed us about his wonderful spiels of slander, dismissal, and cynicism toward our government.

I have come to a concrete conclusion that Ivan Mikhailov's associates were largely responsible for the power and size of the protest, at worst giving them lip service for their own support and at best supplying them with small arms and calling back the local police force."

As he returned to bed, the old general found it rather hard to return to his slumber. He had just learned that the nucleus of his movement was now potentially plotting against him, and after all his hard work, it seemed that White Russia was already poised to tear itself apart.

"Apologies, Mikhailov, but I think you're forgetting something. Shepunov still outnumbers us by a significant margin. Even with my units in play, and those of anyone else I can convince to join us, we're not in a good position here."\n\n"I agree with the general, Mikhailov," Mikhail II began, "We can't just hope to occupy every city when Shepunov has such an advantage. I have the feeling we're inviting disaster..."\n\nMikhailov sighed as he stepped away from the map. "All due respect, gentlemen, but disaster is assured if we start getting pessimistic like this. Shepunov may have more troops, yes, but we have the element of surprise! If we strike hard and fast enough, that bald bastard won't even know what's happening until it is too late."\n\nVolkogonov shot a concerned glance in Mikhail's direction, and was met in kind.

We should just crush them all now and be done with it." Nikolay Kossov interjected, his voice rough and bitter.\n\nFrom across the table, Dmitry Volkogonov sighed wearily. "What, and turn our arms against civilians again? Don't you remember what happened last time, Kossov? We'll need to be smart about this."\n\n"General Volkogonov is right, we'll need to play things safe after that debacle in Irkutsk. Instead of slashing and burning the whole administration, a tight and orderly counter-coup is in order; we shall deploy our units to Chita and detain both Mikhailov and the rebellious Tsar when the opportunity presents itself."\n\n"And who do you suggest we replace him with?" Vladimir Abramov enquired, "We've come too far to abolish the monarchy now, it wouldn't be a good look."\n\n"I believe Prince Nikita will serve as an adequate replacement.

Even now, loyal White Army units under General Volkogonov were preparing for the moment when the die would be cast, and Mikhail would make his move against his captor.\n\nHowever, Mikhail had also grown no less nervous over the outcome of the coup. The general too had expressed doubts on the feasibility of the plot, especially under such a short window of time. What if Volkogonov was right? What if Mikhailov's plan was too bold to work, and Shepunov's clique was able to leverage their considerable numerical advantage to regain the initiative?\n\nWorse still, what would become of Mikhail should the plan fail? Would Shepunov take pity upon him and send him home, or did he have a more violent fate in mind? These questions and more weighed heavily on the captive Tsar's mind.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, he had simply spent too much time preparing and overthinking variables that were out of his control.

The curtains were pulled closed, making the room's atmosphere rather bleak.\n\nTaking a seat, Shepunov folded his hands as he began to speak. "Nikita, I have reason to believe that your cousin is plotting to overthrow the government. We are already taking measures to prevent this, but I thought it would be best to bring this to your attention."\n\nNikita stopped dead in his tracks. "My cousin? Overthrow the government? That's insane, he's already the Tsar, what more could he want?"\n\n"It's unclear at this time, your Highness, but know that he cannot remain in his capacity as monarch while plotting treason against his own country. As the only Romanov present with a strong claim, you shall be the one to take his place." Nikita felt pressure building in his chest. This was certainly a lot of information to handle at once.

He'd played a part in that, trading his soul for money, helping destroy the forest which had provided his family for generations. Oh the IDC had paid him handsomely for his services, the money helped him keep his home, allowed him to provide his children the education to ensure that they'd do well in the new Siberia.\n\nHis children were somewhere down there, working in the vast expanse of steel and concrete.

After a short time spent in a Tsarist prison camp, wondering as to his ultimate fate, he had suddenly been issued simple tools and sent to an iron mine near Chita. Long hours spent underground had driven him almost to the point of insanity, and nearly destroyed him physically besides.\n\nJust as suddenly, however, he had been ordered into a truck, and within short order had found himself in a munitions factory. Assembling and polishing artillery shells was hard work, but it was nothing compared to mining. Even if there were many more guards watching him now.\n\nHe supposed he couldn't blame them. Placing former enemies in proximity to high explosives would have given him pause as well. But they had nothing to worry about, at least not from those smart enough to properly understand their situation.\n\nEven if escape or sabotage was possible, there was nowhere to go, and Matkovsky was gone. As stressful as work in the factory was, it was a far sight better than that of the mine. The food and barracks were better as well. So Andrei would work, and work hard.

"Excuse me Colonel, but what aircraft is that?" Shepunov asked, interrupting the officer, his eyes still firmly locked on the offending plane.\n\nRecovering, the guide caught Shepunov's gaze and followed it to the culprit.

Even some of the generals had been participating in the discussions and debates, much to the Tsar's worry. Was his outfit really such a big deal? The stress of the decision had left the Tsar paralyzed within his bedchamber, a variety of outfits lied out upon his bed.\n\nSome of the generals had argued that a simple, quality suit would show modernity and was more appropriate for the meeting. Others had argued that the Tsar's outfit must display his proper glory, and that a simple suit would make him appear mundane and bland. Mikhail had thought this a fairly accurate portrayal of the Tsar, but they chose to ignore his thoughts on the matter. Maybe Mikhail's wife would know what outfit would work best, but she was still a world away from him. Luckily for Mikhail, his paralysis was resolved by an exasperated Shepunov, who barged into his bedchamber, chose a fairly elaborate outfit, and threw the rest haphazardly into Mikhail's closet. He reminded Mikhail that he only had a few hours left to prepare, and slammed the door shut before he could respond.\n\nMikhail couldn't even pick out his own outfit, and yet he was supposed to rule all of Russia."

Died: 30 November 1968." There was more, of course, a short paragraph dedicated to the greatness of his life and those he left behind. So, that was why the paper had been delivered. Uncle Feodor was dead.\n\nMikhail stared at the entry, feeling a distant ache that was as forced and invented as it was real. He tried again, saying to himself again and again, "Uncle Feodor is dead".\n\nGod, he had to admit to himself, he didn't really care. It was this realization that hurt him more than the actual death. Was he so distant, so removed from the rest of his family that the death meant so little to him? It wasn't as if they had been close, true, but shouldn't he care more about a death in the family?

He looked up towards the small barred window, set high in the wall. "Enjoy it while it lasts, because it won't. You've doomed Russia, you know."\n\nShepunov's mouth twitched in response as he shook his head. "That's where you're wrong. I've simply doomed you, Mikhail. Semyonov should have left you in Australia. Ruling was not something you ever had the capacity for. Not a garden there, not a city here, and most certainly not all of Russia." Shepunov raised a finger. "Russia needs decisive leaders, and the one time you tried to be one you couldn't even take down an old man like me." Unsure of how to respond, and hating himself for hearing at least some truth in Shepunov's words, Mikhail sat back on his cot in silence.\n\nAfter a long moment he spoke, his voice cold but firm. "Congratulations on your victory then, Regent. Now leave me be."\n\nShepunov bowed slightly. "As you wish, Mr. Andreevich." Without another word, he turned and left, his footsteps fading as a heavy door slammed shut.\n\nLeft behind, Mikhail sat in the dark, longing for the past. Moving forward, Shepunov emerged into the light, and smiled as he gazed toward the future."

I write to you now not only because of the time that has passed, but also because you have likely seen the news by now and are confused beyond belief. If not, I will still try my best to explain the situation.\n\nAs I'm sure you are aware, I decided to stay in Australia after my service with the Fleet Air Arm. My life in the so-called land down under was relatively carefree, and I look back on those days with fondness. Sadly, it was not to last. Several years ago, I received an invitation by influential Russian émigrés in Harbin to attend a banquet celebrating the legacy of our family. One thing led to another, and I found myself being crowned as the Tsar of All Russia in the frozen wastes of Siberia.\n\nDespite their generous show of goodwill, these old whites merely wanted to use me as a puppet to fulfill their dreams of domination over Russia and her people. I was kept as a prisoner in my own home, the days spent there becoming some of the darkest in my entire life. Despite the hopelessness of my situation, I had come to the conclusion that my arrival in Russia was a sign.\n\nNo matter the circumstance of my birth, a Romanov should never shy away in cowardice when his divinely-ordained realm needs him most. With the help of some like minded allies, I seized power from those corrupt White generals and became the Tsar I was always destined to be.

While I do believe that some excesses should be curbed, by in large, the army should be loyal to the Tsar and his will."\n\n"That is just nonsense," responded Volkogonov, his voice rising, "the reason people like Shepunov had such influence is because they had His Excellency as a figurehead, using him as another term for 'the nation' rather than their own personal interests.

He also recognized the formation of Tsarist soldiers, assembled near the entrance and receiving orders from an officer.\n\nSoon the information was given to him and the other workers as well. They would be working, yes, but they would also be supervised. Closely. Sabotage had been reported elsewhere, and with the industrial power Central Siberia required for the advancement of the state, it would not be tolerated. Here or elsewhere.\n\nThat was fine with Fyodor. He just wanted to work. Whether it was for Novosibirsk's former regime or for the Tsarists made no difference. So he nodded, picked up his tools, and followed the others inside to his assigned station."

 WCH_superregional.26.desc:0 "Mikhail II, Emperor of All Russia, said nothing as he beheld the statue of his likeness. It was grand for sure, done in the style of the old imperial monuments, his figure placed astride a great warhorse. He guessed it mattered little that he hadnt rode a horse since the days of his youth at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. There had been plenty of horses in Sydney though, throthing at the mouth as they dashed around the Royal Randwick Racecourse to the elation or dismay of the punters. He missed those days.\n\n"Your majesty," the chief sculptor said, a look of worry etched on his face. "Is the statue not to your satisfaction?"\n\n"No," the Emperor lied, not wishing to force the men to redo the work. "It is a fine piece of craftsmanship."\n\nWhat really bothered him was the face. They had obviously taken some artistic liberties with that part. His receding hairline was nowhere to be found on the sculpture, and his eyebrows, characteristically bushy, were on the horseman's face neat and straight. Worse yet they had given him an immense and imposing moustache, in the style of the old pre-October royalty. It was a flattering image, but in some way it made him feel false, as if he was only playing at being Emperor, and this magnificent figure on the horse was the real deal.\n\nHe realised then that it looked not like him but his grandfather, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich. It had been years since he had remembered the old man. At the age of thirteen he had been brought to France to see him one last time, on his deathbed, emaciated and ravaged by cancer. The skeletal Grand Duke had clutched his hands, and made him promise there and then that he would never forget his duties to family and to Russia. At the time this experience had merely given him a fright, but now, thinking back, he considered his grandfather's words.\n\nThe Tsar turned towards the chief sculptor once more, his mind made up."

 WCH_superregional.31.desc:0 "Grinding his teeth together, Artyom slammed his fist against the steering wheel of his truck in frustration. He'd been stuck in traffic behind another damn truck for half an hour. He'd made all of his deliveries, now he just wanted to go home! That settled it, he was going to give whoever was driving that thing a piece of his mind.\n\nHowever, the moment Artyom leaned his head out of his window to do so, he saw exactly why the truck ahead of him was moving so slowly, and also why giving the driver a piece of his mind wouldn't be the brightest idea he'd ever had. On the side of the truck, the insignia of the White Army was marked, and down the entire street and even further, an entire convoy of similar trucks slowly rolled along. A supply convoy, or possibly soldiers being taken to a new location. Either way, there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nFlopping back into his seat, Artyom slouched a little in resignation. He had served himself, done a decent enough job of it, and gotten discharged, and now he just wanted an ordinary life. How much more time was the army going to take from him?"
