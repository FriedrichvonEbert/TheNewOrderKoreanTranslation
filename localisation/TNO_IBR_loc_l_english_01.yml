Not only has it caused a tough situation in our foreign policy, but it also has given a considerable boost to the various separatist and nationalist movements which continue to plague our great union. We must underline that we are a unified nation of Iberians. No longer are we simply citizens of Portugal or Spain, with separate identities and heritage. A common purpose and a new Iberian identity unify us. It gives us strength. We therefore should not hesitate to further embrace this ideal of unity, especially in these harsh times.

Both men have hence developed a good image in the eyes of the majority of the Iberian people. This image has been used to create an effective cult of personality that critics say mirrors the reprehensible ways in which the Germans idolised their Führer. What that slander does not mention is that Iberia's Caudillos do not have to rely on distorting propaganda, as they have entirely proven their worth as leaders.

Galician terrorists nearly killed our beloved Caudillos, a tragedy that would have surely torn apart the union. This disaster has shocked the Caudillos into action, and made them realise that a more stable, long term system of government must be established.\n\nAs such, an Iberian Council has been devised, serving as a tool to deal with regional conflicts and help the various states reach agreements, instead of getting bogged down in the endless bureaucratic quagmire that was the former system.

No other program has ever had such a spotless record, full of bureaucrats who seem to truly care for their special blend of paperwork.\n\nEven though it processes everything such a program could desire - healthcare and pensions, among many more - it is flawed. The Seguridad Social program has fallen behind in recent years, due to its relative non-importance towards other factors.

A new question has come up recently as to a potential addendum to this rule:\n\nNatives from our African holdings do not count as citizens. Therefore, they have limited rights and are not eligible for many privileges that a regular citizen would have.

Once it had been dispersed properly, we took a survey to gauge public opinion.\n\nWith the results all in, we have mostly gotten exactly what we desired.

It seemed like an oxymoron, a riddle you would use to puzzle someone - how do you have two people with total power, heading the same state? It took much effort, but something was eventually devised.\n\nIt has been a long time since then. The times have changed, and with it the world, and the diarchy will likely need some changes as well.

Regional courts can overrule one another, leading to entire cases and trials disrupted because of some petty grievance between judges. Even worse, the federal courts have been rendered toothless, meaning that they cannot stop or even rein in the madness.\n\nWhat kind of system is this? It was created by the Caudillos, sure, but there is no way this is what they intended. Justice and the rule of law are the most important things for a functioning state, and we have neither.

We have deemed the groups the "families" of the state, and there are many - the party itself, the army, church, and so on.\n\nEvery group has their own power and influence, and while they are all ultimately subservient to the Caudillos they can still cause incidents in the government. Even though they are non-official, it would do some good to interfere with them, ever-so-slightly.

They are both represented equally in the Union itself, which has the final say in many regards.\n\nHowever, there are issues with the system. A lack of adequately clear provisions, as well as some uncertain edge cases, have turned the administrative system into a hydra that is more inclined to smack its heads together; a distinct lack of the harmony required to run a Union like ours.

For everyone's sakes, we cannot be either.\n\nWe are, however, the latter. When the Union was first created - the root of all evil, it seems - the compromises made led to what we have now, a bloated monstrosity that chokes the life out of everything it touches.

The question, then, is how do we tackle the question of SENPA?\n\nOne potential solution would be to totally reorganize SENPA and to shed the notion of total control over the agrarian market of Iberia. The Iberian Union is changing. It's high time that SENPA change with it. While we provide the organization with new funds, its directive will change- from an organization set to monitor and regulate the markets, to an organization set to represent the interests of the Iberian government in the realm of agrarian matters."

The Portuguese people shall be ever so grateful that a man such as Franco is picking their new representative.\n\nThere may be a few concerns that Spain's own Caudillo Franco is to pick the successor rather than some shambled together committee of various bureaucrats from Portugal, but there shouldn't be any reason to fear. This is a union of equals and Franco knows this all too well. He has Portugal's best interest at heart, much more so than any pencil pusher. Rest assured, a worthy successor shall be chosen."

A career politician who has long since held various forms of power under Salazar, he is seen by Iberian political society as a mild reformer. This may raise a few eyebrows amongst some hardliners, after all a reformer's a reformer, but this has been offset by his service to Iberia. He appears to truly believe in Iberia and wishes for nothing more than its longevity and success. We will likely know what to expect of him in this respect and may be able to outflank him if need be. He seems to be a safe choice, first and foremost. Or at least that's how he appears for the moment. It will always be important for us to remain vigilant in today's times."

Great changes are beginning to occur here in Iberia, and these new times we find ourselves in do not need useless careerists such as these flunkeys. Franco has a grasp on a great political broom with which he is sweeping up any incompetence from the old stooges of Salazar. The next phase of the political process does not need these men nor does it particularly want them. We're sure they'll get by just fine, after we replace them with men of a finer political standing."

The public can expect to see all the regular displays of Iberian prowess, unveiled for the entire nation to bare witness to and hold dearly in their minds. It shan't be a day that is forgotten about for quite some time. An illustrious affair is deeply needed, even if it's just to hammer home the greatness of this landmark decision.

He could not afford to, once again, put the fate of his glorious homeland in the hands of another man. To put it in the grasps of an outsider, an opportunist and an obstacle would be an act of treason. It would doom the nation to another age of bureaucratic infighting, stagnation and instability. No, he will go it alone. Just as he had done once before, Franco shall take the reigns as the singular head of state. It is truly for the best, yet for the time being he must keep his cards close to his chest.

Their disgruntlement made them desperate and dangerous which had led to some unfortunate incidents in the past. But this is now the present, and in this present Franco is ready to reassert himself and the Falange along with him. The frets, worries and anger of the old guard is to come to an end.

It is intrinsic that all learn what Franco has done for them and how he has impacted their everyday life.\n\nTo do so, we shall give the important job to our greatest propagandists capable of spreading this message far and wide. Every man, woman and child is to be bombarded with appraisals of the Generalissimo, if they are to truly place their trust in him. And trust in Franco is trust in the nation, so this thought process will be an important task to accomplish for everyone. We're sure the vast majority of Iberians aren't traitors, and thus they will humour us in agreeing that Franco is representative of the nation.

Franco is the best option for all of Iberia future and the masses will come to know of that son enough. We're sure a bit of persuasion from the charming Franco and our propaganda services will soon put the minds of the people at a calming ease.

We're sure he'll excel in the role, and will get a good feel for what needs to be done in his new office. It's his first day so it's likely we won't be seeing any dramatic moves but an eye is still best kept on the new Caudillo. Vigilance is key in these difficult times and we can't rest easy for no-one these days. It's for the best though, that Caetano feels warm and welcome in his job.

Caetano clearly has no need nor use for the bureaucratic vestiges of a dead man. Instead he looks to the future, his future more precisely with his own people. All will know that Caetano is not just some carbon copy replacement of Salazar. He is his own man, with his own ambitions. These ambitions will hopefully be delivered with this influx of new staff. Iberian political life will no doubt be impacted by these latest changes as the era of Salazar slowly fades from memory."

Some in Iberian political society have turned their noses up at the idea, seeing it as stinking of Caetano's alleged reformist mindset, but many more see it as a welcoming take on the role of Caudillo. It will certainly cause a bit of a stir and shall show off the Caudillo role for the public to gawk at, face to face.

He has, thus far, graced the office with this professionalism and has reinvigorated it with a welcoming freshness. Kicking out Salazar's cronies, and the various other stooges and lackeys that made up the crux of the office, and going on a grand tour of Iberia has certainly put Caetano in our good books. The Union looks to be strong, sturdy and stable with Franco and Caetano ruling over the nation as dual Caudillos. It is a welcoming sight to see the maintaining of the Unions stability with this choice of Caudillo now seemingly entrenched.

Rumours of fighting, riots and looting have been thrown around but we can confirm very little for the moment. What we are not hearing though, is any sort of calm and lack of disturbance. This can only mean that some form of trouble is starting to arise at an ever-quickening pace. This trouble seems to be spiralling out of control at an uncontrollable rate, and we can only hope to get a grasp on the reality of the situation soon. For something will have to be done sharpish, before whatever situation is arising comes to a head and it becomes too late to do anything about it. If we don't keep a handle on this soon, the consequences could be truly devastating for the whole of Iberia. Containment, it seems, will soon become key.

Something must be done, that we can all agree on. The question though remains, how uncompromising shall our response be?\n\nOne side recommends we take a firm hand but not one that overdoes it. Control will be hopefully established, but our forces will not be allowed to run rampant in order to put down the insurrection by any means. In response, another side recommends going the whole 9 yards with our reaction and let the protestors know we mean business. No chances can be taken with this situation, we cannot afford to look weak in the face of a challenge such as this. Control of the situation must be established as soon as possible by any means before the protests gain enough momentum to become near unstoppable. It's a tough decision, and one that will definitely have consequences not just for Portugal but for all of Iberia."

They are partly responsible for the current crisis and thus, it is only right for us to hold them accountable. We will need to decide though, just how much we're going to hold them accountable for and how harsh we will be with our justice.\n\nOne option would be to send a message with our righteous justice that these actions will not be tolerated. It will certainly put off any other would be two-bit politician who thinks they can stand up to the Iberian Union's central government. Others though have expressed doubts as to whether this option will not have lasting ramifications that could create a deep-rooted atmosphere of future distrust and bitterness over our handling of these events. Instead, the situation could be resolved with a more forgiving hand in order to settle the situation. It may just calm the situation, but it could also be interpreted as a sign of clear weakness that the fifth column and other opportunists may pounce upon. Whatever decision is made, it will have to be done quickly in order to settle this ever-growing crisis."

The atmosphere, the very memory of what occurred here may have a lasting legacy we cannot hope to escape from. As people ponder what happened here and what could possibly occur again, it is our job to steer the nation through these tormenting times. If not, we will have to face something even bigger and much worse than the previous incident."

The decision to take in public input would be drastic and will no doubt showcase a commitment for democratic reform.

Of course, it is likely that they wish to shape the discourse to make sure the military's power remains absolute yet they also make up an integral part of our movement.

For the safety of the Iberian nation, we will diminish the roles of these councilmen. When you consider what is at stake here, it is after all for the best that this occurs."
 
 IBR_old_guard_hangs_on:0 "The Old Guard Hangs On"
 IBR_old_guard_hangs_on_desc:0 "There have been murmurings around the Congress that the old guard of Iberia should be tossed out and left to wither outside the political scene. How could we possibly let this occur? These men once put everything on the line to save Iberia from the fifth column threat. To completely ignore their voices now would be a stain on the new government. The old guard shall remain, no matter what the more idealistic members of the Congress may say."

 IBR_grasp_the_reigns_desc:0 "While the Iberian Council will have the primary power in the new government, it is only right that the Caudillos are to reserve the right to interfere. If the future of Iberia is at risk due to the incompetence or intentions of the Council then it is only just that the Caudillos are able to save Iberia from this scenario. Some may call this authoritarian, that the Caudillos are merely securing their position but what do these detractors know? Through these means, the Caudillos will make sure Iberia does not succumb to anarchy."

 IBR_distribute_excess_desc:0 "There are some very troublesome figures in power in Iberia at the moment. Many can see these people as wreckers and agitators but we can't simply make them "disappear", not anymore anyhow. Well fear not, for they shall do some "important" work elsewhere from the main currents of the Iberian political scene. Be it at the colonies or some far flung embassy abroad, these nuisances will be thankfully away from the new Iberian government. It will surely be for the better that this occurs and all of Iberia will eventually thank us."
 
 IBR_balance_council:0 "Balance The Council"
 IBR_balance_council_desc:0 "With regards to the Council, to go too far in one direction or the other would put the security of Iberia at risk. Sudden drastic changes could take place without so much as a murmur with little jurisdiction. This would allow the Council to run rife and potentially destabilize an Iberia we have worked so hard for. In order to avoid this likely catastrophic sequence of events, the council shall be equally balanced between those belonging to the reformist and conservative factions. This should stop any surprises arising from the Council."

 IBR_swear_loyalty_desc:0 "There will, of course, be disagreements in the Council. To get around any problems arising from this, it is imperative that the Council members are to swear loyalty to the Caudillos. The Caudillos have Iberia's best intentions at heart and this fealty will represent that the Council is of the same mind. Councilmen will not become beacons for their own selfish grandeurs of power. Loyalty to the Caudillos and Iberia comes first, no matter what."

Were we to implement full scale reform at a breakneck pace, who knows what kind of leap's people would take? Separatism could become rife; communism could return as a political force and God knows what else may occur. To stop any of these Iberian tragedies, liberalization will be put on the back burner. It will occur but only at a rate that guarantees the future stability of Iberia."

In order to avoid a succession crisis that may threaten to tear our country apart, we will have to change the way we get a new Caudillo. Instead of the Caudillos merely hand picking their successor, the Council shall elect a future Caudillo in order to maintain the stability of the country in an act of conciliation and agreement among the councilmen. This shall hopefully mean we can avoid a future disastrous leadership crisis."

 IBR_let_in_desc:0 "We have done it. The grand all-encompassing part of the process is over and we have guaranteed our future. Some may cravenly mutter in darkened corners that our reforms were not enough, that they were merely acts of self-preservation, but what do they know?! They can't even begin to comprehend what was at stake here. If this process was not done in this way then murder, war and chaos could have swarmed our blessed Iberia. We have done what we must. We have saved Iberia from itself. In doing so, we have protected the lives of all of Iberia's citizens who couldn't possibly imagine how close they could have been to certain death."

Usually, we don't offer very much - trinket reforms, a few hollow promises. Nobody falls for it anymore. To really get anywhere with them we'll need to really convince them that this is the time where it's different; where it's going to change. In order to do that, we'll need to put a bit more on the line than usual.\n\nThe best way to mislead the councilmen into thinking we're going to do something good for them is in the most part posturing. To best bring them in they will be promised the one thing they all desire - power.

Checking the snares will be our first act against the council. Anyone who seems a bit too radical for comfort will be incarcerated. The same of those who are a bit too dissenting. It wouldn't do to have someone who didn't have Iberia first, after all.\n\nSimultaneously, the rest will be forced to remain in the chamber for far longer than necessary. It's not out of cruelty, but out of preemptiveness. Most do not take the job seriously, which does not lead to someone who will do a good job. Therefore, they need to have their priorities re-aligned by force. This is not an optimal solution, but it is a necessary one."

For the good of the councilmen, it will change.\n\nThese worms are going to sit themselves down, and they are going to think. They will be given a time limit, and they will give a solution once the time is up. While they whimper to themselves, we will think of the solution to our own problem.

 IBR_dissolve_the_council:0 "평의회 해산"
 IBR_dissolve_the_council_desc:0 "After careful consideration, the Council is not worth the effort of keeping around. Even in an advisory role it simply could not justify its existence. The council was prone to corruption, and vulnerable to terrorist infiltration. Anyone with a lick of sense could see that something in this state clearly has nothing of value to say. So, it mustn't say anything at all."

 IBR_supremacy_of_the_caudillos_desc:0 "There will be no greater authority than the two Caudillos, who shall reign supreme over Iberia. And why wouldn't they? They are the most qualified, the best for the job. If anyone were to say otherwise, then they would be clearly showing themselves off as a traitor and guilty of treason. There must be no room for disputing the greatness of our leaders, and anyone who doubts their ability must be removed."

There are a number of councilmen who were paragons of virtue, shining examples the others neglected to follow. There is no reason these dedicated men should be punished for the actions of their colleagues, and if anything they ought to be rewarded for their duties to the state.

 IBR_absolute_loyalty:0 "절대 충성"
 IBR_absolute_loyalty_desc:0 "It is not enough to just have a loyal government. It has to be more loyal. Unless they will gladly die for Iberia on a moments notice, they are not loyal enough. Anyone who wishes to have a place in government must be totally committed to the Caudillos."

 IBR_cycle_the_regional_governments:0 "Cycle the Regional Governments"
 IBR_cycle_the_regional_governments_desc:0 "It is, simply put, a horrible idea to let someone govern his own countrymen. A petty nationalism still exists in place of an Iberian spirit, so until it subsides no governor shall rule over his own origin. If we let them rule over their own people, then they will place them above the Union. This must not be allowed to happen, so we will force administrators to govern regions other than their place of origin."

 IBR_work_out_our_differences:0 "Work Out Our Differences"
 IBR_work_out_our_differences_desc:0 "While vital to ensure the Union can exercise proper control of her lands, the laws used to enable that must be carefully calibrated to ensure they don't cause more anger than they must.

 IBR_new_fundemental_laws_desc:0 "Our current legislation has done us well. But we can't keep the same laws forever. The times are changing, and we require new regulations and restrictions to keep up with it. With the information from our governors, and with a totally loyal legislation, we can begin revising and drafting new laws for all of Iberia. This new code will be the same for all Iberians, no matter where they reside in the Union. It will be harsh but just. These new laws shall lead Iberia into the modern age."

We have new governors, entirely loyal to the Union and none other. We have a new set of laws, ensuring equal and just treatment for all on the peninsula. We have a legislature, dedicated to maintaining Iberia in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. Greatest of all, our regime is secure from any internal elements who would wish to depose us. Finally, our Union may have her calm."

 IBR_our_loyal_advisors:0 "충성스런 조언가들" 
 IBR_our_loyal_advisors_desc:0 "The Council should, after careful deliberation, be allowed to remain in their current position. They are a dedicated, loyal bunch, committed to doing their part to improve the Union. Given that they are content with their lot it would avoid a lot of trouble to keep them in the status quo. While it will take some effort to ensure the measure doesn't backfire, it carries great potential."

 IBR_Place_Everyone_Everyone_Place:0 "A Place for Everyone and Everyone In His Place"
 IBR_Place_Everyone_Everyone_Place_desc:0 "Even though the Council is purely advisory, each member of it have been content with their lot. Let it never be said that we are not generous - each councilman and his family will be carefully and expertly cared for in a luxurious suite complex that will cater to their every need. Of course, this all depends on them staying loyal to Iberia. To make sure they do, or at the very least as leverage for if they don't, the new residential area will allow us to keep a close watch on their loved ones. For safety's sake, of course."

 IBR_Check_Advisors:0 "Check the Council Members" 
 IBR_Check_Advisors_desc:0 "So far we have had no issues regarding the Council. There is no guarantee of how long that will last. The most we can do is take precautions to ensure that no enemies of the state slip their way onto one of the most highly trusted positions in the Union. Who knows what damage they could inflict in such a position? There are no small number of programs and methods we could use to vet the Councilmen, and to ensure they are as truly dedicated as they claim. The more meticulous the better, so we will leave nothing in their pasts unchecked."

 IBR_Lets_Keep_Order:0 "Let's Keep Order" 
 IBR_Lets_Keep_Order_desc:0 "We value the stability of Iberia above all else. Usually the Council is a positive force for this stability - they provide insights and perspectives on issues that would otherwise go ignored. This advice can allow for laws to be better tuned, ensuring they're as efficient as possible. Sometimes, however, they have the opposite effect. Council members can at times take the impression that they are entitled to more. While dedicated, they simply do not need more to continue doing the job that they do. It's important that we make them aware of that fact."

 IBR_Fully_Functioning_Council:0 "A Fully Functioning Council" 
 IBR_Fully_Functioning_Council_desc:0 "The Councilmen know their place, and they are sufficiently loyal. Sadly, it seems we were mistaken when we estimated that our Council would be able to work fine as it is. The times are changing, and unless we change with it we will be left in the dust. We need something more functional. They must have more weight to what they say, as they are an important look into what we can improve on."

 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions:0 "Listen to The Council's Suggestions" 
 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions_desc:0 "The Council must have more weight behind what they propose. It would be impractical to even have them only to disregard everything they say seemingly for the sake of it. We ought to be more receptive to their ideas; not to say that we will agree with everything for the sake of it, but that we must recognize that, occasionally, they know what they are talking about. After all, if they are on the Council then by virtue of that alone they must have some experience to back their words."

 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government:0 "Listen To the Regional Governments" 
 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government_desc:0 "It would be wrong to leave out the regional governments of Iberia. Like the council, each region and their governments have unique perspectives and takes on the issues we face today. We could use the input of each regional government to help fine-tune coming reforms."

 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences:0 "Respect Our Differences" 
 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences_desc:0 "Every nationality in Iberia has a few 'quirks' to them. These 'quirks' can make administering them all quite difficult at times, since it can cause quite a bit of a headache trying to keep them all in line. Rather, we could devise a new system to allow the loyalty of these minorities. While autonomy is out of the question, we could still strike a mutually beneficial agreement. In exchange for loyalty and unconditional support for the Union, we could most likely look the other way in regard to some of their less harmful 'quirks'."

 IBR_Revamp_Council:0 "Revamp the Council"
 IBR_Revamp_Council_desc:0 "Now that we've laid the framework, we must now begin setting it all down in stone. We will prepare a new set of laws, guaranteeing the new position of the council and properly putting our ideas into lasting action.

 IBR_Just_Dodged_Bullet_desc:0 "It is done. All over Iberia tensions are cooling, and it seems like people have just been losing the will to stay mad, for the most part. There are many dissidents in the Union still, but they will find that the people tolerate their nonsense much less. The new place of the Council seems to have soothed the worry of many, and with the promise of a bit of tolerance, many others have found newfound loyalty to the Union. We have saved Iberia from those that want to tear it apart, and all it took was modifying the role of the Council."

They argue that this will improve our diplomatic standing among the democracies of the world, in addition to solidifying the legitimacy of the elections.\n\nHowever, several council members have spoken up against this proposal, labeling it as an infringement on Iberia's national sovereignty.

Loud cries are, however, heard across the country urging the Council and the Caudillos to "ensure everyone's right to participate", with a minority of council members speaking up on their behalf.

Having seen the work of the Council towards the survival of our Union, I am now confident in the value of reform. The system of government, as it stands, cannot last much longer. Despite how it pains me to say these words, I realized that stepping down is the only way forward. I have too many memories, and too much hope in the people of Iberia to let you down.

As a part of this we instituted a blanket embargo on trade between Iberia and the German sphere.\n\nWith Germany's economic downturn and the collapse of the Triumvirate realities have however changed. We must take a note out of Bismarck's playbook focusing on pragmatic Realpolitik. The embargo had been a necessary measure to show solidarity with the fellow Triumvirate members but in reality, it had often been broken if only secretly.

Now that democracy has been restored, the old guard are up in arms too, attempting to strangle freedom in its crib and restore the autocracy. At least the other major parties and their supporters have accepted the election results peacefully. Our first priorities must be to deploy the police (in a responsible manner), make clear our aims to the restless working class and make sure that the military doesn't get any funny ideas."

 IBR_the_matter_of_autonomous_communities_desc:0 "The Autonomous Communities - the administrative divisions of Iberia - haven't had anything resembling autonomy since the civil war. Franco and Salazar's obsession with centralisation led to any degree of self-governance they once enjoyed being stripped away in the name of "streamlining" the administration. The result, rather than a more efficient government, was a bloated and overworked bureaucracy that served as a breeding ground for corruption. Reversing the centralisation of our state is not only the right thing to do morally; it is also much more practical and will ease the burden on our administration."

There are a number of regional leaders who are usually responsible for the various protests, strikes and riots that crop up from time to time. Though they have always possessed a fair degree of plausible deniability, their names and involvement is an open secret these days. Given the current unrest, they clearly remain unconvinced by our campaign promises. The best course of action would be to meet each of them privately, so that we may clearly elucidate our plans and get them on-side."

He sought to totally erase their distinct cultures after they dared to defy the Nationalists. Restoring the right of these people to speak their own language is no act of revolution, but merely a return to that most time-honored of Iberia's traditions: diversity. This injustice must be dealt with, now."

 IBR_new_statues_of_autonomy:0 "New Statues Of Autonomy"
 IBR_new_statues_of_autonomy_desc:0 "The old statutes of autonomy were shockingly easy for Franco to rescind. There was virtually no resistance from the government remnants of the time, likely out of spite for the perceived "failure" of the Basques and Catalans to halt the Nationalists. Though we cannot say for certain that there will never be division within Iberia again, we can take steps to soothe wounds both old and new. Not only will the statutes of autonomy be re-established, we will also enshrine them in the constitution. Henceforth, regional autonomy will no longer be a matter up for debate."

 IBR_the_agrarian_unrest_desc:0 "The peasantry and landowners were two of the few demographics not severely impacted by autarky, as the vast majority of their crop yields were purchased by the state itself or by food companies operating under state supervision, rather than being exported. The end of autarky has many of them worried about foreign competition, and some peasant communities have already downed tools in protest of our promises to make the agricultural sector more competitive. Unlike our compatriots in the PRD, however, we will be careful not to let the free market get out of hand. Reassurances must be doled out to inform the agrarian populace of our good intentions before we find ourselves facing widespread protest action and subsequent food shortages."

 IBR_meet_with_the_axencia_desc:0 "The Axencia are quite rightly a force to be wary of. Their long record of successful prosecutions and tireless zeal in pursuing anyone deemed a threat to national security is both commendable and rather concerning. However, they are clearly professionals at heart, and rather less politicised than we initially feared. We think that's the case, anyway - they haven't arrested us for winning the election yet, at any rate. There may be some mutual misunderstandings that remain, so our new cabinet should meet with their leadership as soon as possible to smooth things over."

 IBR_find_what_were_looking_for_desc:0 "When we set out to fulfil our promises of restoring regional autonomy, our critics demanded to know exactly what we hoped to accomplish by turning back the clock on centralisation. Many pointed out that regional unrest, most prominently in Catalonia, was a leading cause of the coup that triggered the civil war. We must admit that they were not entirely without fault - the party was, indeed, divided over what fulfilling our promises meant. Now, however, we believe we have found the answer that was demanded: a new vision of autonomy, where the constituent nations of Iberia act as faithful confederates with the assurance that their ancient rights will not be trampled upon by government overreach and paranoia."

In Catalonia, it was even reported that club-wielding Falangists attempted to scare away Catalan voters! Had it not been for the Guardia Civil, who knows how widespread such incidents might have been? Similarly, more than a few radical leftists were caught red-handed, their pockets stuffed with forged and filled out ballot papers!

There are many anti-democratic groups in Iberia, both left- and right-wing, who loathe what we stand for and wish to see Iberian freedom destroyed. It would be folly to simply send out the police en masse to arrest everyone we think is responsible, however. Proper, thorough inquiries into each and every suspected group, individual and ideology must be carried out. Due process must win out over political convenience."

 IBR_protect_the_congress:0 "Protect The Congress"
 IBR_protect_the_congress_desc:0 "Securing safe and free elections is the most important item on the agenda right now, but we must also look to protecting Congress itself against direct action. Iberia has a long history of political violence. Prior to and during the civil war, leftists, fascists and the military killed one another with impunity, whittling away at the foundations of the Second Republic with every death. Nobody who votes should have to worry about going back to the polls a month later because a bloodthirsty ideologue mowed down their representative in a hail of gunfire. The Caudillos made the houses of government well-suited as fortresses - let's double down, and extend the role of the Guardia Civil to protecting the physical manifestation of government."

 IBR_extend_the_vote:0 "Extend The Vote"
 IBR_extend_the_vote_desc:0 "The surest way of making election fraud more difficult, short of arresting the perpetrators, is to drown out fraudulent votes. The first election had a good turnout, but the franchise was not as broad as it should have been. The voting age of 21 is far too high, and the fact that women had to qualify at all when most other major democracies have had universal suffrage for half a century is absurd. Additionally, there are many citizens convicted of petty offences who have been forbidden to vote for life. With our majority in Congress, drafting and signing into law the legislation required to address these injustices should be no problem at all."

 IBR_faith_in_the_people_desc:0 "What greater expression of faith in one's people is there than to place power in their hands? The Iberian people might have chosen poorly, but they knew better - as we believed they did. They made clear that they did not wish for petty division and civil strife, but rather longed for peace and justice. For years, the Caudillos insisted that democracy could not work in Iberia for so long as the threat of radicalism persisted, but the people proved them wrong. The radicalism that was so feared amounted to little more than a few misguided souls screaming into the wind of change. The Iberians were tested, and were not found wanting. Democracy shall continue, and its principles shall never die so long as a free Iberia endures."

We can expect resistance from the old guard, Falangists and possibly even the conservatives of Alianza Popular. But it must be done. There have been too many families torn apart by baseless convictions; too many denied basic freedoms because they spoke out of turn; too many miniature Caudillos who grew drunk on the power they held over the people. Justice is due."

 IBR_legalize_the_opposition:0 "Legalize The Opposition"
 IBR_legalize_the_opposition_desc:0 "The idea unnerves even us a little, but the parties outlawed by the Caudillos must be allowed to operate in the political arena again. This includes the social democrats, socialists, communists and even the anarchists (though they're not likely to care either way). There will be outrage and frothing at the mouth from the right, but we must stand up for our democratic principles. Anyone willing to participate in a democratic system and who swears not to subvert it will be welcome, so long as their party is not found guilty of any wrongdoing."

 IBR_audit_the_prisons_desc:0 "The prisons have been full to bursting since the civil war. Countless political prisoners and citizens jailed for minor offences have simply been thrown in with the genuine criminals and left to rot. This state of affairs is unacceptable, especially given the horrifically high rates of assault, murder and suicide within prisons. Though the process will be long, painful and drawn-out, the only just solution is to go over conviction records, the judicial system and the prisons themselves with a fine-toothed comb. We must find the resolve to press forth until every wrong is righted."

Essentially a fortress built around a concentration camp for political prisoners, none who enter will ever leave - save for the guards and prison staff. This symbol of Francoist tyranny must be shut down immediately. Every single staff member will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with accordingly should they turn out to have been complicit in any criminal offence themselves, including mistreatment of prisoners. The inmates of the prison will be distributed among several smaller, more modern and humane prisons until reviews of their trials and supposed crimes are completed. The Tarrafal will be mothballed until we figure out what to do with it - perhaps it would make a nice museum or luxury hotel with a bit of work?"

Who knows how many burgeoning fascists these lies have created? This kind of despotic claptrap will no longer be permitted - from now on, our mandate on education will be that our recent history, from the early 20th century onwards, must be taught in the most objective manner possible.

We know that their equipment and training could be better, yet no apparent improvements are ever made. So where, pray tell, does all that funding go? Why are so many of the wealthy bourgeoisie of our nation commissioned officers rather than bankers, businessmen, entrepreneurs and lawyers? Why is the private still paid a pittance while every second lieutenant has a house, a mistress and an Italian sports car? We must brave the lions' den and set about the military apparatus with the same rigour and decisiveness that we have applied to the bureaucracy and judicial system, lest this blatant corruption continue even in the face of renewed German aggression!"

Even within Franco's inner circle there was always dissent, and now those dissenters turn to us for the realization of their dreams. It is not enough for there to be mutual trust between ourselves and the electorate - we must extend the hand of friendship to any who will take it in earnest. Iberia is not yet lost."

Where once the streets were quiet and ordered, the jackboots of the over-militarised police clicking on the cobblestones, they are now filled with life. Businesses, homes and churches alike have become places of hope and happiness. Even the halls of government peal with laughter at times, as a sense of optimism unrivalled in our nation's history sets in. Above all else, there is the sense that no matter what comes, Iberia and its people will find a way to endure. No fascist, terrorist or mad dictator will halt our ascent to heights yet undreamt of! For a free Iberia, and a better tomorrow!"

 IBR_marketlib_victory_desc:0 "Tired of the unending inaction on our economic woes under the Caudillos, the people of Iberia have chosen to prioritize its betterment in the first congressional election. Our Partido Renovador Democrático now holds a comfortable majority of seats. At long last, confidence in the peseta has begun to rise, and foreign investors are already knocking at our door in anticipation of what our economic reforms will bring to the nation."

 IBR_embrace_capitalism:0 "Embrace Capitalism"
 IBR_embrace_capitalism_desc:0 "Naturally, the first order of the day is to do away entirely with the Caudillos' notions of autarky and instead embrace whole-heartedly the capitalist free market system that worked so well to enrich the supposedly "decadent" West. The insistence on self-sufficiency proved nothing but disastrous in the long run, and the damage to foreign confidence in our economy was significant. However, there's no cure quite like economic freedom, and it shouldn't take too long to undo the damage the Caudillos inflicted upon us."

 IBR_promote_trade_schools:0 "Promote Trade Schools"
 IBR_promote_trade_schools_desc:0 "With an entire generation having grown up under autarky, there is a distinct lack of economic know-how amongst the newer batches of economists and entrepreneurs churned out by our universities. Further education to remedy this is necessary, so we shall establish dedicated institutions to ensure that nobody taking up a career in economics goes in with only one eye open. To do otherwise would put us at a disastrous disadvantage compared to our economic rivals."

 IBR_less_economic_restrictions:0 "Reduce Economic Restrictions"
 IBR_less_economic_restrictions_desc:0 "The amount of barriers and red tape blocking even the most basic of financial endeavors from proceeding is truly staggering. One almost wonders what the Caudillos were thinking when they drafted the legislation that they put in place to begin with. Assessing each of the relevant policies individually would only waste time and resources better spent introducing our own, more helpful legislation. A slash-and-burn approach is called for. The markets will sort out any resultant fallout in due course."

 IBR_privatise_government_assets:0 "Privatize Government Assets"
 IBR_privatise_government_assets_desc:0 "State ownership stifles innovation and scares off foreign investors. There is absolutely no sense in having so many economic assets under the direct supervision of government bureaucrats without the training to handle them, especially when there is no shortage of skilled and eager entrepreneurs chomping at the bit to take the burden upon themselves. Selling off these assets will not only prove our devotion to free market principles, but will also free up bureaucrats for more important tasks and provide a healthy cash injection for future government spending."

 IBR_new_tax_plans:0 "Reform the Tax Code"
 IBR_new_tax_plans_desc:0 "A 70% tax on big business? 50% on small businesses? Absurd! What's the point of such high taxes if there's hardly anyone they'll apply to in the first place? For all his military acumen, Franco was clearly not a man with an education in economics, and Salazar certainly didn't help matters. Still, it's never too late for a few tax cuts and rationalisation of the Tax Code. No amount of red tape will stop the razor's edge of free enterprise!"

 IBR_expand_market_sectors:0 "Expand Underperforming Market Sectors"
 IBR_expand_market_sectors_desc:0 "While the economy in general is in poor shape, there are a number of market sectors that are in particularly bad condition. Our agriculture, despite being a massive section of the economy, remains backwards in methods and means of management. Subsidies for farmers and incentives for investors, along with efforts to finally complete mechanisation, should be just the ticket to compete with the juggernaut of Ukraine. Furthermore, privatisation of our major manufacturers will finally allow for a long-overdue modernization of industrial machinery and techniques."

 IBR_a_nation_of_opportunity:0 "A Nation of Opportunity"
 IBR_a_nation_of_opportunity_desc:0 "The United States has been able to call itself a "land of opportunity" for over two centuries now. Yet, despite our own nations being many centuries older, we have never been able to claim anywhere near their level of progress on the front of freedom and prosperity, even after unification. Only through plunder of the New World did Spain ascend to global dominance in the first place! Neither the autarky of the Caudillos nor the slave economy of Germany have proven viable systems; instead, the liberal nations of the world have clearly won out, demonstrating that hard work, ingenuity and economic spontaneity are the key to the enrichment of Iberia. With enough effort, any Iberian might be the next Ford or Rockefeller!"

 IBR_Work_of_God:0 "A Work of God"
 IBR_Work_of_God_desc:0 "The Fascists, Marxists and Francoists all called us mad, but who is laughing now? The economy is booming, foreign money is pouring into our coffers and the common man is buoyed aloft by a sense of optimism unrivalled since the golden age of Spain and Portugal! The Church, which was originally wary of our "plutocratic intentions" has come around to our way of thinking, and fully supports our efforts to rejuvenate Iberia. The cries of those backwards thinkers stuck in the 19th century grow ever quieter beneath the cheering of the masses at our success, and even men of the old regime offer their thanks and congratulations! While Germany struggles to rise from the muck of slavery and stagnation, we, once the laughing stock of Europe, soar ever higher on the world stage! Viva Iberia!"

 IBR_marklib_responsible_democracy:0 "A Responsible Democracy"
 IBR_marklib_responsible_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is no good if nobody understands its functions or purpose. Without proper education on its inner workings, voters may not even know what it is they're voting for! We should fund programs to educate those too young to remember the Second Republic, as well as help older voters catch up on the changes made to our old system. Furthermore, funding should be diverted to both public and private schools to establish constitutional education classes, so that everyone from the wealthiest of the bourgeoisie's offspring to the lowliest peasant's child understands the system and their place within it."

 IBR_freedom_of_speech:0 "Loosen Restrictions on Speech"
 IBR_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "What power is there in language, really? Words are but wind before our present economic realities, and that's what really matters right now. Rolling back restrictions on freedom of speech and the press will be of no consequence, as our policies and the prosperity they bring will speak for themselves - and much more eloquently than any critic. Let the reds and reactionaries shout; the jangle of a full purse will always be louder."

 IBR_more_voting_booths:0 "More Voting Booths"
 IBR_more_voting_booths_desc:0 "Despite the genuine efforts of the electoral commission, the election that established our authority may not have been wholly representative of the entire population. Of course, we hold no blame for this, and enough of the population voted for us that it didn't really matter at the time. Still, there were a number of rural communities and neglected municipalities - particularly in Andalusia, Galicia and Extremadura - that did not receive the same level of attention as the major population centers of the north, east and heartlands. This was an unfortunate occurrence, but one easily remedied with a spot of increased funding for more booths and a boost to the number of election monitors to cover every municipality in the country."

 IBR_regional_elections:0 "Hold Regional Elections"
 IBR_regional_elections_desc:0 "Merely voting for the government at a federal level is not enough - neither to satisfy voters, nor to ensure the smooth cycling out of old and unpopular local governments. Regional elections, for mayors, councils and so on, are just as important for our new liberal democracy as they are for every other democratic success story. It is crucial that the common man sees democracy in effect at every level of government, so that he does not lose faith in our system and turn to violent solutions for his problems once again."

 IBR_Catholic_Guidance:0 "Catholic Guidance"
 IBR_Catholic_Guidance_desc:0 "While our party and the Church have been somewhat at odds in the past, we would have them know that any issues we have with them are purely related to their role in government. When it comes to social issues and morality, we are happy to work hand-in-hand with the clergy and the Vatican. Not only will their backing be useful to shore up conservatives' confidence in our government, but much of the old guard may be swayed by direct Church support for our policies - and we will not pass up the chance to recruit those of them with the sort of talents we are looking for."

 IBR_change_with_the_times:0 "We change with the times..."
 IBR_change_with_the_times_desc:0 "Franco may have gone too far in some places. We understand his intentions - separatism was certainly a pressing issue at the time - but this is a new era of peace and understanding. Let the Basques and Catalans have their languages and traditions. There is nothing to gain economically from continued suppression, and everything to lose from the return of regional unrest. We certainly don't want to lose our newfound economic clout over such small issues as languages or local festivals!"

 IBR_Some_lines_should_not_be_crossed:0 "...but some lines should not be crossed."
 IBR_Some_lines_should_not_be_crossed_desc:0 "Though we have embraced economic progressivism, social progressivism is another matter entirely. We are, of course, a true Iberian party - and any true Iberian party is a true Catholic party. That said, not all Iberians are as dedicated to Catholic values as we are, and it would not do to simply ignore their complaints or pretend that we do not live in an increasingly globalised society. Divorce is an issue that continues to divide both Iberia and our party, with many considering the traditional family too important to social cohesion for us to dare infringe upon. We must decide whether to allow for a degree of secularism and permit divorce, or continue our unwavering devotion to Catholic principles. Neither option will please everyone."

 IBR_Harmonious_Society:0 "For a Harmonious Society"
 IBR_Harmonious_Society_desc:0 "God, Fatherland and Family are all well and good for the foundation of a society, but you cannot build a house from the foundations alone. The Church may be our bedrock, but it is capitalism, and the freedom to exploit it, that allows for the house to be built. While the Catholic faith ensures that all men are treated as brothers in Christ, economic and personal freedom will ensure that said men are able to make the best possible use of their lives and careers, rather than labouring under the yoke of autarky. The ordinary work of the common man is the foremost path to holiness, and so freeing him to decide for himself is an imperative. A prosperous and holy people will ensure the harmony of Iberian society."

 IBR_tackle_government_incompetence:0 "Tackle Government Incompetence"
 IBR_tackle_government_incompetence_desc:0 "Iberia's government, much like its predecessors, has a long and shameful reputation of incompetence. The Caudillos did little to remedy this, stacking it with regime loyalists and those considered "politically reliable". This simply will not do. Anyone found to be unqualified for their position will be summarily sacked and replaced with a new recruit, so that we may begin to maximize efficiency."

 IBR_marklib_government_training:0 "New Government Training Programs"
 IBR_marklib_government_training_desc:0 "Even with the removal of totally incompetent and unqualified staff, there are many employees who only have a vague idea of what they should be doing. It's too late for the system, but it isn't too late for them. Rigorous but fair training programs will separate the wheat from the chaff, leaving us with only those truly cut out for government service. While we would like to simply cut out everyone not 100% qualified for their jobs, such an act would only breed hostility and be a waste of potential talent."

 IBR_restructure_federal_agencies:0 "Restructure Federal Agencies"
 IBR_restructure_federal_agencies_desc:0 "Much of the blame for Iberia's woes can be laid squarely at the feet of our bloated, inefficient bureaucracy. There are thousands of superfluous employees and even entire agencies who do barely any work but still manage to sponge up millions of pesetas every year. These will obviously get the chop, but that will leave something of a vacuum in our bureaucracy. To compensate, other agencies will be expanded and the now-vacant roles of the old agencies consolidated, vastly cutting down on the number of employees required and straightening out our labyrinthine bureaucracy."

 IBR_marklib_anti_corruption_measures:0 "Anti Corruption Measures"
 IBR_marklib_anti_corruption_measures_desc:0 "Corruption is virtually inevitable in every despotic system. A despot hires his friend, his friend hires two of his own, and it continues on and on until the entire system is nothing but yes-men. Thankfully, Iberia's government had not yet decayed to such a point when we came to power, and there's still plenty of time to clean up the departments and bureaus that comprise it. Nepotism is the foremost concern, but there also seems to be an awful lot of money missing from some departments..."

 IBR_judicial_reform_70:0 "Judicial Reforms"
 IBR_judicial_reform_70_desc:0 "Nowhere will one find more fascist old guards than in the courts and magistrates of Iberia. Not even the military comes close to the total grip that the Caudillos enjoyed over our nation's lawyers and judges. Those responsible for  these miscarriages of justice will be disbarred from their profession for life, and brought to trial themselves if necessary. In place of regime loyalists, the legal system will now favor highly educated and qualified individuals. It is critical that the members of the judiciary be of a high moral character, and capable of making sound judgements when a mere interpretation can decide the fate of a nation."

 IBR_marlib_final_step:0 "The Fruits of Our Labor"
 IBR_marlib_final_step_desc:0 "For the first time in centuries, the man on the street can say "Yes, I have a great deal of confidence in our economy and our institutions." For all their political clout, the Caudillos never accomplished that. What we have accomplished is great in its own way; the ordinary worker, regardless of whether he wears a blue or white collar, enjoys more than just a livable wage, and we gave him that without kowtowing to trade unions or reinforcing the failing policies of autarky. For the first time, he can trust that Iberia is in the safe hands of truly competent leaders, who are willing to reform the system into one that works for all. We have yet to see how this progress will continue, but we have faith in God's favor of Iberia."

 #marLib oil crisis tree (market liberal)
 
 IBR_market_liberal_oil_crisis:0 "석유 파동"
 IBR_market_liberal_oil_crisis_desc:0 "Mierda! Instability in the Middle East has caused an economic crisis that the papers have already dubbed "The Oil Crisis". Our dependence on Middle Eastern Oil has meant that we have been hit particularly hard by the crisis and our economists are predicting an imminent economic recession. This means that it is up to our government to weather the storm and guide the Iberian ship through this mess."
 
 IBR_Opus_Dei_Program:0 "Opus Dei Emergency Program"
 IBR_Opus_Dei_Program_desc:0 "It has been argued that in these times of crisis intervention in the market in some form is necessary. Even officials within our ranks are starting to be convinced by foolish economic policy. It is our luck that the loyal institution of Opus Dei has provided a comprehensive plan in order to emerge from these dark times.\n\nThe organization has promised that with certain stimulus arrangements the market would be able to recover and begin resuming a normal trend. In general, however, the emergency program is designed to uphold the market liberal ideology while alleviating the shock of the crisis. After all, the market has always proven itself to be most efficient at designating resources. Opus Dei have promised that opening the possibilities of exploiting new energy sources to investors, and pushing for tax cuts across the board, will bring back the forces of supply in order to meet the outstanding demand. Until then the market should be allowed to stabilise itself."
 
 IBR_Earn_Your_Wage:0 "Earn Your Wage"
 IBR_Earn_Your_Wage_desc:0 "A fair number of petitions have made their way to the desks of government officials in light of the current oil crisis. One of the most disturbing however was a one complaining about a factory in Barcelona firing most of their staff unfairly in order to uphold liquidity. This is clearly unacceptable. We cannot have companies going bust and damaging the necessary market forces we need to stave off this crisis.\n\nTo remedy this issue it has been suggested that a new work culture should be introduced, one where we can insure that firms uphold required staff numbers without paying for it with unmet variable costs. Hence, we should ensure that companies know they are supported by the government in firing unnecessary workers as long as they keep those who are truly earning their pay. This should promote productivity in the long run too." 
 
 IBR_Audit_SegSoc:0 "Audit Seguridad Social"
 IBR_Audit_SegSoc_desc:0 "In the plan to restructure the economy the eyes of officials have fallen on the administration responsible for Seguridad Social. It has been recognized that social security is an important component of modern state organization, but this does not mean that just like with other government branches that it is immune to inefficiency. In line with arguments that have claimed that it only is a bottomless pit that continuously sucks money without giving back to the economy, we have decided it finally is time that we audit the whole operation. There certainly will be parts that are either not an absolute necessity or that are downright mismanaged. All these will be cut in order to save money for the government which can be used to stimulate the currently still tanking economy."
 
 IBR_Oil_For_Pay:0 "Oil... For Those Who Can Pay"
 IBR_Oil_For_Pay_desc:0 "With the ongoing oil crisis other nations have seen drastic government overreach through direct intervention to restrict oil consumption in the economy and to artificially reduce its price for state enterprises. We on the other hand will use no such draconian regulation to harm our economy. The free market has historically proven itself to be the most effective and efficient distributor of resources through the demand and supply paradigm. Hence, we should leave it to these forces to decide what happens with the oil that our nation has access to. It surely will go to those with the most need which we can identify by how much they will be willing to pay for it."

 IBR_Invest_Energy:0 "Invest in Energy"
 IBR_Invest_Energy_desc:0 "The crisis has shown us above all that oil as the sole energy source for many economic sectors cannot be relied on anymore. With any lack of energy diversification, a shock could bring great ruin. We must therefore look to other energy sources that can be exploited to ensure that our economy will be on strong foundations even when those around us are suffering. Surveys of options that we have available have produced arguments for hydroelectric power generation amongst others. It is necessary that we move quickly to restore faith in the market."
 IBR_invest_energy_tt:0 "Investments in new energy sources will increase costs by §Y$6 million§! and give §Y1 £tt_power grid power§!"
 
 IBR_Let_Market_Alone:0 "Let the Market Sort Itself Out"
 IBR_Let_Market_Alone_desc:0 "Some officials and pressure groups have come to the government to argue that direct intervention to correct market forces is essential to bring the Iberian economy out of the crisis. With great difficulty and after a number of intense debates have they been rebuked. It is clear that they have been seized by an irrational panic! Do they not know that the market is the best and only tool to correct itself? Time and time again when central authority has intervened in order to bring about what it says as good change has it resulted in terrible outcomes. On the other hand, the market has always been able to efficiently correct course and stabilise the forces of demand and supply. We must once again trust its capability; it will surely lead us out of this crisis stronger than before."
 
 IBR_Find_New_Markets_ML:0 "Find New Markets"
 IBR_Find_New_Markets_ML_desc:0 "Liberalising the internal market conditions has consistently been a priority for government policy due to the terrible conditions which the previous regime had left for us. However, with the advent of the oil crisis it has become clear that work needs to be done to expand our market liberal vision into the international sphere. In a similar vein to energy diversification we also must seek to expand our trading networks. Our currently weak links were damaged by the expansive economic damage that weak preparation and an incomplete restructuring of market forces had given us. Finding new markets abroad will hopefully ensure better trading capabilities in the future and ensure that future crises will not ravage our economy again."
 
 IBR_Tax_Cut_Oil_Crisis:0 "General Tax Cut"
 IBR_Tax_Cut_Oil_Crisis_desc:0 "The government has been terribly affected by the oil crisis, both in financial but also national security terms. A large factor in this is the economic downturn that domestic markets have faced. Both companies and private individuals have fewer funds than previously and hence are not spending or investing which are the important bloodlines our economy depends on. It is not for the government to sort out issues with how people interact with the market and more importantly how it functions, yet we should certainly facilitate an opportunity for the market to resuscitate itself. In this we have decided upon a general tax cut which will affect all interests in the economy. By individuals and firms having more money again we will hopefully see a return to a new normal."

 IBR_Allow_Private_Services:0 "Allow Private Services"
 IBR_Allow_Private_Services_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to influence the Iberian population and culture into accepting all tenets of free market capitalism we have never been able to really breach the bastion of support surrounding the provision of what are deemed essential public services. The crisis has however given us new impetus in our mission to finally achieve total victory over those who stand in the way of liberalising all aspects of the economy. Under the guise of returning financial stability to government expenditure it has been decided to allow private versions of public services to be authorised. With those who can afford private provisions switching we are still providing a safety net to the less advantaged strata of our society. Under current legislation the change will remain under review for a good amount of time as many are still not entirely convinced by the measure, however we are sure that the efficiency the market will display will assure them otherwise."
 
 IBR_Negotiate_Creditors:0 "Negotiate With Creditors"
 IBR_Negotiate_Creditors_desc:0 "Since the formation of the Iberian Union the new state has relied on large expenditures to ensure a semblance of external safety and internal stability in a tumultuous Europe. This has resulted in a large amount of debt now sitting square on our shoulders. With the international economy having taken a great hit many creditors have allowed panic to set in. A number of them have insisted that Iberia pay back its debts with the most utmost urgency, in some cases even with reduced interest rates. It would however currently be detrimental to our recovery were we to pay back all of the amassed debt. We hence need to find common ground with the creditors and convince them that both our parties would be better off if the debts could be delayed for a longer period of time."
 
 IBR_Thank_Later:0 ""You Will Thank Us Later""
 IBR_Thank_Later_desc:0 "The economic measures implemented on the behest of Opus Dei and with the clear approval of the administration are proving themselves to be successful by the necessary factors measured. They have however incurred the wrath of certain interest groups and some of the wider population. Describing the reforms as ruthless and amoral they have rallied against the government in protests and numerous petitions. Clearly when relying on technocratic advice it sometimes is difficult to make the public understand our intentions. Necessary sacrifices may be seen as negligence or even worse intentional evil. Like with so many things in history only hindsight will be able to clear the cobwebs from their eyes. In time they will thank us for what we done for them and those who follow. We have chosen the correct and righteous path."
 
 IBR_Crutial_Moment:0 "A Crucial Moment in History"
 IBR_Crutial_Moment_desc:0 "We stand now at a crossroads of vital historic importance. Iberia must choose whether to embrace and effectively work with our reforms or deny their value and fall alongside other nations entirely crippled by the economic crisis. The Union has the potential to become a leading powerhouse in Europe, towering above nations with similar demographics only due to the effective management of market forces. We have done all we can for now, our response was well orchestrated and allowed the passing of necessary legislation in combating the crisis. The foundations for a strong economic upswing hence have been set. It is for Iberians to now lead the Union further into prosperity or reject the gifts we have bestowed upon them."

 IBR_conservative_victory:0 "Alianza Popular Victory"
 IBR_conservative_victory_desc:0 "In the wake of democracy's restoration, the people of Iberia have made their voices heard. We, the Alianza Popular, have successfully claimed a strong majority in the Iberian Congress. The masses have spoken: order, justice and good Christian morals shall be the order of the day. A wise decision on the part of voters, and one we shall do our utmost to validate."

 IBR_Moral_Nation:0 "A Nation of Morals"
 IBR_Moral_Nation_desc:0 "Good character, of society, nation and individuals, is crucial for any good Catholic nation like our own. Decades ago, godless revolutionaries sought to tear down every moral boundary and standard in our great nation; the streets of Barcelona were filled with drunkards, hedonists and loose women! Had it not been for the moral guidance of the Caudillos and the Church, they might have spread their vile profligacy throughout the entire peninsula! This was surely the result of the secularisation and "liberation" propagated by the Popular Front and their radical allies. No such depravity shall ever find a foothold again under our watchful eye, and we must educate the nation correctly so as to ensure the same remains true under future generations."

 IBR_Traditional_Nation:0 "A Nation of Tradition"
 IBR_Traditional_Nation_desc:0 "God. Fatherland. Family. These were the words Franco used as the basis of his rebuilt Spain - and why not? Do these notions not define Spain, most pious of the Catholic nations and oldest of the colonial empires? New, vigorous leadership need not mean a reversal of course, and we know a good thing when we see it! While change may inevitably come with time, Franco's motto shall for now remain our motto, but now for the health and happiness of all Iberia, not just Spain."

 IBR_Freedom_Nation:0 "A Nation of Freedom"
 IBR_Freedom_Nation_desc:0 "Freedom to assemble, to talk, to criticise, to protest... all concessions we can make. Ruling is certainly easier when your critics are silenced (or at least muffled), but we must accept that the resumption of censorship and civic crackdowns on relatively harmless political elements will only damage the peoples' trust in our newly elected government. Democracy might have its fair share of woes, but those who claim it to be the "least worst form of government" are probably worth listening to over the more draconian Francoist old guard."

 IBR_Patriotic_Education:0 "Patriotic Education"
 IBR_Patriotic_Education_desc:0 "Without question, one of the worst crimes perpetrated by the communists, anarchists and syndicalists during the civil war was their attempt to tear down the very national identity of Spain itself! The Portuguese should be thankful that they were spared this indignity. It is clear that this improper attitude only found a foothold thanks to the vulnerabilities created in the modern mind by the overwhelming nature of modern life and the rapid rise of poorly thought-out education among the masses. Some more liberal-minded types might complain of the stuffiness and rigidity of our new education program, but instilling a strong sense of nationhood in our youth is vital to ensure the continued success of Iberia as a strong-willed and free nation of the world."

 IBR_Library_Expansion:0 "Expand The Libraries"
 IBR_Library_Expansion_desc:0 "Books, as the saying goes, are the light of the world. While there's no book quite so good as the Good Book, there is no shortage of great (if less relevant) literature to inspire and educate both current and future generations. We will not go down in history as a pack of book-burning fanatics like the Nazis when we can instead encourage the growth of our public libraries with more funding, literacy programs and grants for new authors. The more... old-fashioned members of our party occasionally express their dismay at the possibility of deviant or - God forbid - Marxist scribblings finding their way into the hands of our youths, but we trust that proper education will have everyone agree to relegate such trash to the dustbin of history."

 IBR_More_Sport_Less_Latin:0 "More Sport And Less Latin"
 IBR_More_Sport_Less_Latin_desc:0 "A classical education is all well and good, but as far as tradition goes our emphasis on Latin as a mandatory subject for all students might be slightly excessive. After all, can a true Iberian man - much less a caballero - find the strength to be a good son, husband and father if he spends his youth with nose buried in the writings of Caesar and Cicero? It may be stimulating for the mind and for his sense of heritage, but the Iberian man is one of action! We will never abandon our ancient linguistic roots, but the boys we pass our mantle to when the time comes must be strong in both body and spirit to carry the weight of the nation on their shoulders."

 IBR_Cultural_Diversity_Protection:0 "Cultural Diversity Protection"
 IBR_Cultural_Diversity_Protection_desc:0 "At the end of the day, we are a federation of constituent nations, not an all-encompassing juggernaut that tramples its own people. It has been this way even before the Iberian Wedding of Ferdinand and Isabella. Perhaps Franco was right to clamp down on the autonomy of the Basques and Catalans at the time of the civil war, but that time has passed. God did not make the Castilians, Leonese or Portuguese to rule alone; He made us as equals. With the political situation no longer necessitating Franco's stern measures, we can instead look to healing the divisions between the majority and minorities in our nation, and guarantee that our national brotherhood will endure any future tribulations."

 IBR_Rural_Roots:0 "Honor Our Rural Roots"
 IBR_Rural_Roots_desc:0 "The economy isn't what it used to be, and the days of the peasantry as the majority of the population are long past, but does this mean we should simply embrace the materialistic urbanism of the Americans or the Reich? Of course not! The soul of Iberia is that of ruralism, even if economic realities mean that cities and industry are the way of the future in practical terms. In the rural life, we find reflected a simpler, happier time, when the peasant whiled away the days in his fields under the responsible stewardship of his lord and the local parish. This is what we honor: the peace and respectability of the life that was for the vast majority of our history."

 IBR_Iberia_Forever:0 "Iberia Forever"
 IBR_Iberia_Forever_desc:0 "Odd as it may seem, there is one new tradition that has come to us in these troubled times: Iberia itself. Initially created for solely pragmatic purposes, it has come to represent something else entirely: a great and diverse people - the IBERIAN people - who, having been divided by tribal boundaries, petty rulers, and mad ideologues for millennia, have finally come together as one family. From the plains of Andalusia to the mountains of Navarra and from the picturesque Lisbon seaside to the humming industrial towns of Catalonia, our strength and brotherhood flourishes like never before. The nations that fathered us will live on, but they are no longer all that we live for. Iberia now, Iberia forever."

 IBR_Dawn_New_Era:0 "Dawn of a New Era"
 IBR_Dawn_New_Era_desc:0 "When our party was elected on a platform of common sense economics and good Christian virtues, the fascists and Marxists alike spat venom in the press and in the streets, deriding us as delusional and Quixotic for our dedication to our principles. Now, they say nothing - if they dare to do so, they are shouted down. Not by us, for we would never deign to engage in political brawling, but by the countless loyal supporters we find amongst the populace. What clearer mandate to govern could we possibly enjoy? Iberia, with the backing of the people and the Catholic Church, has begun its climb to heights unmatched since the days of the Armada and the empires! We have in short order accomplished within a democratic system what the Caudillos could not accomplish in nearly two decades of their joint dictatorship! A new era dawns for all of Iberia: one of peace, prosperity and, above all, stability. There can be no greater gift for our generation to leave the Iberians of the future. God bless Iberia!"

Some in the opposition claim that it is mere censorship, but anyone can see that it is merely common sense standards for news media to follow: no defamatory claims, no family-unfriendly content on front pages, and so on. Is it so terrible to think of the children now and then?"

 IBR_Political_Parties_Registry:0 "Registry of Political Parties"
 IBR_Political_Parties_Registry_desc:0 "Prior to the civil war, many groups on both sides of the political spectrum were fairly informal in nature. This was especially true of the radical left, which commonly organised itself along the lines of trade unions, workers' militias and village communes.

 IBR_Demilitarize_Police_desc:0 "During the civil war, the Spanish metropolitan army proved itself either treasonous or comically inept, with only the Army of Africa being reliably capable and loyal fighters. As a consequence, Franco drastically expanded the numbers and roles of the police to maintain order amongst the ruins. Entire squads on patrol with military-grade equipment certainly put the fear of God into any recidivist reds, but they were also expensive and prone to overreacting to perceived threats. With any major unrest and secessionist movements now suppressed, such a bloated force is no longer necessary, and we can be confident that rolling back Franco and Salazar's reforms will not cause any undue problems for us in the long term."

 IBR_Regional_Question_AP:0 "The Regional Question"
 IBR_Regional_Question_AP_desc:0 "Unfortunately, even after Franco's long-term crackdown, regionalism remains an issue that will undoubtedly rear its ugly head again if not dealt with appropriately and in short order. We are loathe to continue Franco's policies, which actually seem to have encouraged a stiffening of resistance at times, but at the same time we cannot heark back to the Popular Front's policy of increased autonomy, for that would only end in disaster and the dissolution of Iberia. The matter must be put to the Cortes and the cabinet. Perhaps it may even be worth putting out feelers towards regional groups?"

 IBR_Token_Autonomy:0 "Token Autonomy"
 IBR_Token_Autonomy_desc:0 "Naturally, the matter of autonomy has already been decided. There will be no "states within states" in Iberia again. While we understand their desires, regionalists must learn to accept the reality of the Iberian Congress. If total legal equality is good enough for everyone else, it's good enough for them. We shall not budge on this front, though we will of course allow for minor concessions - the right to choose their own public holidays, along with other culture-specific issues, perhaps?"

 IBR_Axencia_Expansion:0 "Axencia Expansion"
 IBR_Axencia_Expansion_desc:0 "The establishment of the Axencia was easily the wisest decision made by the Caudillos in regard to our internal security. Operating at a level the police and even the military cannot, the Axencia is both sword and shield of the state - and, by extension, the people of Iberia. Since they have not apparently made any moves against the democratic process, we feel confident in our belief that they serve the state first and foremost, rather than those in power. In light of this and their years of loyal service to Iberia, it is only fitting that the organization be expanded and its funding increased, especially as the role of the police is reduced in our renewed state."

Falangist old guard, fascists and marxists alike can all be relied on to attempt to subvert our democracy whenever the opportunity to do so presents itself. Though we have already taken the initiative and enshrined the secret ballot, we must go further. Election monitors will help prevent electoral fraud, and a new cadre of bureaucrats will ensure the electoral rolls remain clean and well-organised. If the Iberian democracy of the future can thank us for anything, it will be our dedication to the principles of fair and free democracy regardless of how inconvenient it is for our party's interests."

Doubtless, they always had Iberia's best interests at heart, but everyone knows what they say about Hell and good intentions. Indebted though we may be to their vigilance, we must not indulge in any whitewashing of their deeds. Nobody needs to know the gory details, but publicly accepting the realities brought about by the harsh times the Caudillos reigned over is an important first step towards building trust between ourselves and the electorate - not least because there are many former regime staff within our party."

 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code:0 "Rewrite the Penal Code"
 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code_desc:0 "Under the Caudillos, there was an aggressive approach to law enforcement at times. While we recognize the necessity of strong-arm tactics by the Axencia, the court system itself should not have such a reputation for brutality and heavy-handedness amongst the common people. The working class, especially, remains wary of them despite our promises. It would be most prudent to rewrite our nation's penal code and ensure proper judicial oversight, especially given the strong sympathy for the Caudillos amongst judges and prosecutors."

 IBR_Franco_was_Franco_desc:0 "As we have repeatedly told our critics: Yes, we are aware of everything that Franco did before, during and after the civil war. Should we renounce him merely because his actions were often unpalatable to modern sensibilities? No! His gradual easing of harsh laws and the successful return of democracy proves more than anything that he was no fascist demagogue beholden to a Bohemian corporal, but a highly pragmatic man who would go to any lengths for the sake of his beloved nation and its people. He only cracked down on genuine threats to Spanish stability, and in the case of the reds it was certainly well-deserved! Did he accept the aid of Hitler and his motley of gangsters? Yes, but who then could have forseen Germany's total conquest of Europe or the construction of Atlantropa? None should be so hasty as to judge him with the benefit of hindsight. This will be our party line, and there shall be no apologies for it."

 IBR_Renew_Catholicism_desc:0 "Even under the Caudillos, regular church attendance was far below its height in our more prosperous days. The only spike in recent years was when the German civil war erupted and the people suddenly found something rather pressing to pray about. What kind of Catholic party would we be if we failed to take advantage of our newfound legislative power by reminding the people that Iberia is, above all else, a Catholic nation? Nobody is suggesting mandatory church attendance, not only because it goes against our principles but also because it is unlikely to truly motivate the faithful. Instead, we should focus on inviting the church to play a greater role in social, welfare and educational programs. Combined with a healthy dose of funding for new religious construction (especially in the chronically godless region of Catalonia) and some well-deserved tax exemptions, we can restore Catholicism's place of pride as one of the pillars of Iberian culture and society."

That said, they are far more influential in our nation's economy than we would like them to be. We shan't go so far as to criminally probe them - that would be totally unjustified and a waste of resources. However, it would be perfectly reasonable to declare that an audit of their finances and activities is due; a simple bureaucratic review to make sure that everything is in order. While this is obviously just a sensible thing to do from a government standpoint, doing it publicly may also ease the fear common among the fascists and the godless that we are unable to treat Catholic organizations objectively."

Despite the conservative nature of the church in Spain, there is strong support among Catholic women for the earlier iterations of feminism that brought about change in more liberal nations. Our party is split on the issue along reformist and traditionalist lines. One the one hand, the Church's teachings on the structure of the family are clear, and we would not wish to give offense or act in an un-Christian manner. On the other, can we really afford to retain the idea of women acting solely in traditional roles, with a modern industrial economy and a broad sense of internationalism on the rise?"

It was the Christian vote that carried us to our first electoral victory, and it shall be the Christian vote that buoys us in future elections. This is only possible because we alone recognize what other parties do not: that Iberia and its constituent nations are, now and forever, Christian nations, bearing the heritage of nearly two thousand years on their collective shoulders. To abandon our faith as the bedrock of society would be folly; to actively abolish it would be madness."

Our plan is for a double-pronged approach with both tax hikes across the board and rooting out wasteful spending that holds over from the previous administration. By chaining our government spending, we will be able to ensure that the crisis doesn't get any worse than it currently is.\n\nWhile this certainly won't endear the population to our government, we can only hope that we will be able to hold our position in power long enough to get through this crisis so that we will be able to lift the measures."

This is why it seems necessary to freeze salaries to prevent an unemployment crisis on top of our current economic crisis.\n\nHowever, many of the business leaders we have courted over the election cycle have expressed their discontent at this policy behind closed doors so we will have to placate them at some point."

Savings practically disappear one day, and then return doubled the next. A continuation of this trend of this unpredictability must be stopped or else we face a much worse crisis.

We need to make sure all terrorists are rightfully branded as separatists, since they clearly intend for nothing but the dissolution of the Union.

What's worse, the obsession with individual over collective has ruined the moral standards of the Union until nothing will be left but anarchy and degeneracy.\n\nThe decrepit system is incompatible with our radical reforms. Democracy is nothing but a sham used by Leftists to seize power against the will of the people. The system needs to go, for the good of Iberia. Equally so, anyone who objects must be shut down and silenced. It will take a long time to fully dismantle these shams, but it will be time well spent.

With the acceptance of the people we can begin moving the balance of power. Even despite their best efforts people simply just don't know what's best for them. The ability to decide will be moved away from them and to experts, who understand how to give everyone exactly what they need.

Only one step remains until we can take on the legacy of the Caudillos.\n\nWe will proclaim O Estado Novo - the new state.

Now that the old government is no more and a transitional government has been assembled to transform Iberia into a true democracy, the revolution that began in the streets will see its end in the actions this new government will take to free Iberia from the yoke of tyrants."

Most of them didn't react soon enough to the revolution and are incarcerated; while those that were able to gather supporters to rise against the people's will were swiftly defeated and now share cells with their partners.

With the old regime gone, this group have pledged to support our cause of liberty, but they have their reservations. With socialists now allowed to rally and publish their newspaper the conservatives have sent the government their concerns over what they call "barbaric socialists".

The only way we can stop this disturbing trend is to give the Axencia the ability to work better with less, and even better with more.

For his faith, he was rewarded with rain, solving his drought and banishing the false prophets. This passage applies to us, too. The false prophets, the terrorists and the separatists, they claim that they can save their people, but they are built on lies and falsehood.

They are a generally conservative lot, yet still far too liberal for Franco's liking. However... they have a good deal more common sense than many of the old guard, and are committed to achieving their goals through gradual reform rather than iron-fisted oppression. One of these goals that they have in mind is a new kind of regional autonomy, wherein minorities would be guaranteed core rights such as the use of their languages and the freedom to celebrate their traditions. At the same time, they would not be granted any kind of administrative autonomy. In effect, the regional governments would be run BY the people, but FOR the state. This may be just the compromise we're looking for."

The CRC will manage any and all matters related to the diverse regional minorities of Spain and will be composed of both appointed and elected individuals.

It would be a shame if that map were to be given to the Americans, so that they could disable the infrastructure when they find necessary."
 
 IBR_Green_Berets_Bissau:0 "비사우의 그린베레"
 IBR_Green_Berets_Bissau_desc:0 "Africa is a vast place, with many different environments. What no-one will tell you is that these environments are less different than one would think, and there is a lot of crossover between them. For example, there are many skills you can learn in one place that you could make use of in another. It is only logical that the Americans would appreciate learning some skills for their time in South Africa.\n\nWe will open up Guinea Bissau to the United States military, and in particular invite their special forces to come train in the area. They could use the practice to fight better in the hostile environments of Africa, where Guinea could prove a valuable introduction to it."
 
 IBR_Cancioneiro_Niassa:0 "니아사의 노래"
 IBR_Cancioneiro_Niassa_desc:0 "The mission of the Portuguese in Angola, their divinely ordained duty, was to civilize the people there. Since the Portuguese were chased away by the Nazis, that job was left only half-finished. Yet still, the history of Portuguese colonialism in the region is something that can be used to our advantage. One of the first things the settlers did was teach the inhabitants Portuguese, in order to better communicate with the natives. Portuguese language is by no means universal, but a significant enough number of Africans in the former colonies know the language to make alternative operations practical.\n\nWe will deploy forces able to use the power of song and voice to strike fear into the Africans fighting under German command, turning their traditions and customs against them. These operations will harm their morale, allowing the Americans a better chance."
 
 IBR_Airborne_Nurses:0 "Airborne Nurses"
 IBR_Airborne_Nurses_desc:0 "Some of the Portuguese are without a doubt brave. That, or they are just thrill-seekers. Either way, their willingness can be put to good use in service of the Americans. Medics are not always on time, nor can they get to some places easily on land. What makes it worse is that they can't always get where they need to be by air, either - as they would have nowhere to land. The Portuguese airborne nurses have been created to solve that problem.\n\nThey will parachute out of helicopters and other aircraft at high altitudes, into hostile conditions, in order to save lives. Through thick and thin, no matter the risk. It is here that the bravest will shine, and those who are in it for a thrill will get exactly what they want. They will be like angels from heaven, come to bring salvation to those in need."
 
 IBR_Counter_Insurgency:0 "Counter Insurgency Units" #Jungle if you change it again I swear to God I will come to Brazil and break your kneecaps
 IBR_Counter_Insurgency_desc:0 "The African SS are native to the land. Despite their faults, they make valuable guerilla fighters. Since they have grown up, lived, and will likely die in the battlegrounds that make up the area near South Africa, they are intimately comfortable with the land. Because of their unique heritage, they are like ghosts. The Africans move from the land, strike, then hide with the native population before the Americans can so much as lift a finger. No longer!\n\nThe time has come to even the advantage. Some retornados were natural outdoorsmen, and have never truly forgotten their old home. For these qualities some have been approached by the CIA, who wish to recruit them for the war effort. If we allow them to, it could nullify the advantage the Africans have."
 
 IBR_New_Viritatos:0 "Os Viriatos"
 IBR_New_Viritatos_desc:0 "Iberia has sent quite a few Portuguese down to the south of Africa. No matter how many we send, it just doesn't seem to be enough. Clearly the mistake was prioritizing quality over quantity so highly, as we have sent barely anyone. Any advantage is quickly nullified by the total lack of people to capitalize on it. As it were, we will be sacrificing a bit of that fighting quality for numbers.\n\nTo this end we will reform the Viriatos volunteer divisions, originally deployed to Spain to assist Franco, many years ago. Many brave Portuguese men will be able to taste the honor of battle, made all the sweeter by revenge. They will not rest until Angola and Mozambique have been avenged!"
