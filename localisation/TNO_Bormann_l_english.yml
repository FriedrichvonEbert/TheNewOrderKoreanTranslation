 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_DESC:0 "Nazism has always relied primarily on two things: nationalistic sympathies towards one's own nation, and a central strongman smart enough to trample his enemies in the political game and sway the masses. None of Hitler's potential successors embodied this more than Martin Bormann; who learned closely from The Führer in his time as his secretary and strives to emulate him in every way. In doing so; Bormann has honed in on the nationalistic sentiments of the population to convince them that he is the only man in the Reich able to keep them safe and their nation secure. Often calling himself the 'Second Hitler' to cheering masses as he fed them exactly what they wanted.\n\nThe political arena has proven to be less of a battlefield and more of a shooting gallery to Bormann as well. While Bormann oft paints himself as an anti-intellectual and a simpler man to the masses, in the Reichstag he has proven himself to be a fierce negotiator, power player and deceiver to many. While Germany is divided between himself and the others who dared fight him, the Reichstag has always been firmly under his boot. Truly, if politics could win wars, then Bormann would have long ago conquered the world."

 # Civil War Events #
 ####################
 bormann.0.t: "The Political Rodeo"
 bormann.0.desc: "With the horrors of the Bürgerkrieg behind us, the Führer had dared to hope for some semblance of order and stability to return to the Reich. Unfortunately, it seems that this is barely the case. Though the remnants of the traitor Göring's forces were reintegrated to the Reich, thanks to the mercy of the Führer, some, Schörner chief among them, still push their agendas, and they are not alone. The remnants of the traitor Speer's clique still agitate the youth, ranting and raving about reforms and liberalization. \n\nReforms will happen, but not as Speer envisioned them. The Reich will not sink into the depravity it has fought so hard against, but instead will rise from the ashes of recent memory like a phoenix. Efforts to re-educate dissidents have already begun, and reintegration efforts, personally ordered by the Führer, make rapid progress in ensuring that the legacy of Adolf Hitler, forgotten by the rebels, is the Reich's only philosophy.\n\nThe Heer has already been deployed to key areas to ensure further stability, and the Führer works around the clock to reform the slave system to something more economically sound. Our Reichskomissiariats will be brought back into the fold, the Führer has promised time and again, and the native revolts will be swiftly put down.\n\nAs for those who doubt the Führer, who wonder how things would be if another sat in the Reichstag, they will be dealt with swiftly. The Führer, with his characteristic political savvy, has already begun to work at chipping away the foundations of treasonous institutions and replacing them with loyal National Socialists. The Heer will be brought in line, and the students will learn to see reason.\n\nAnd when the work is done, the Reich will stand above all enemies, and the Führer will deliver unto the world the glory of true National Socialism."
 bormann.0.a: "Heil Bormann!"
 bormann.0.a_tt: "§YThe Web of Influence is now available.§!\n§g-----------------§!\n§RTo secure§! §YControl§! §Rof Germany we must work to secure the §Yloyalty§! of the various demographics and interest groups within Germany, either that or limit the §Ypower§! of those we cannot control. It is only by dominating this§! §YWeb of Influence§! §Rthat we may maintain stability in the Reich and purge our enemies.§!"

 bormann.1.t:0 "Bormann is Victorious"
 bormann.1.desc:0 "Bormann rode in triumph through the remains of Germania today towards the Volkshalle as bands played Das Rheingold and crowds cheered his arrival, waving the Reich's banner on every corner. An honor guard received him there, where the nation's new Führer quickly began announcing his plans for his new order.\n\nIn his speech, Bormann emphasized that his right to rule has been established already, not in the flames of the German Civil War but in the victories and accomplishments of the Reich in WWII. As the rightful continuation of the German governmnent, he now rules an order built up by the sweat and toil of Germans decades before, and saved and brought into the next decade by the sweat and toil of Germans now.\n\nInternationally the response is mute, as the United States and Japan both dig their feet in and prepare for more of the same from Germany."
 bormann.1.a:0 "At last the Reich is ours!"
 
 bormann.2.t:0 "The Germania Corridor"
 bormann.2.desc:0 "The war drags on, and sees no sign of ending. Many worry the Civil War is approaching a new stage: absolute anarchy.\n\nWith no central authority and the fatherland being devoured by its children, the various pretender states are losing their ability to supply their cities, and famine has begun to spread across the devestated country. One thing is clear, the war needs to end, and soon.\n\nThe Generals are calling it the Germania corridor. The city has been highly militarized by Speidel and his men and won't be an easy fight to win, but if we were able to overwhelm him and his defenses and break through the other side, it could be enough of a push to swing the war in our favor, as well as secure us the prestige of winning back the city.\n\nOf course, Speidel will be a difficult egg to crack, but if we don't do it, surely someone else will try it soon."
 bormann.2.a:0 "We march on Germania!"
 bormann.2.b:0 "We will be crowned in peace."
 
 bormann.3.t:0 "Anarchy Reigns"
 bormann.3.desc:0 "The war has dragged on, famine has begun spreading across the cities as food and water has become a harder found resource than any other. The men are all gone, dead or dying by choice or by force on the battlefield. Millions are dead, and the major cities of Germany have been absolutely wiped out, none free from some form of devestation or another. As more and more of the little remaining infastructure becomes victim to various war efforts, food and supplies no longer move around, and the famine only gets worse, disease quickly following along with it.\n\nThis is the true beginning of what people are calling the German Anarchy, and the worst has yet to come."
 bormann.3.a:0 "Rocks fall everyone dies."
 
 bormann.4.t:0 "Bormann Ordering Nuclear Strikes"
 bormann.4.desc:0 "In a move that will surely shock not only international observers, or even our enemies, but also our native people, Bormann has decided, in a desperate move to take down his enemies, to officially launch nuclear missiles.\n\nThis comes as a shock to international observers around the world, due to the ongoing stalemate that belligerent nations have been embroiled in for the past few decades. A nuclear launch into any nation could threaten to tear apart alliances, nations themselves, and even the current world order. This will, no doubt, have far reaching consequences that will leave no nation, or person, untouched..."
 bormann.4.a:0 "Fire away!"
 
 bormann.5.t:0 "Victory Almost Assured"
 bormann.5.desc:0 "The Fatherland stands in triumph! Speer and his dirty rats have been sent running, Göring and his revisionists stands destroyed, and Himmler's puppet Heydrich was sent to his accursed Burgundy! However, the War is not over yet - Germany has one more hurdle before it can return to the greatness it always had - that would be Speidel, and his Germanian defence force. By a miracle of God, our Welthauptstadt Germania has remained relatively unharmed by the war, and its inhabitants hail Speidel and his former commander, Erwin Rommel, as heroes for saving the beautiful landmarks of Germany.\n\nThe final step to reuniting Germany and returning to glory is to have Speidel make his guards stand down and let us enter Germania. Yet Speidel is in control of his army, and it is up to him to make the choice for it to bow to us."
 bormann.5.a:0 "We stand victorious!"
 
 bormann.6.t:0 "Speidel Surrenders Germania!"
 bormann.6.desc:0 "The wounded Germany that we inhibited has been marked with tension in the past days while Speidel contemplated his response to our request of putting his forces on stand-down orders. However, the entire nation took a sigh of relief and joy when Speidel and Rommel announced that their divisions would stand down for the first time since Germany engulfed itself in internal conflict, and allow Bormann's forces to enter Germania peacefully. As church bells rang across Bavaria and beers were passed out to impromptu crowds in Germanian pubs and beer halls, it seemed no place in the Reich did not do something to celebrate the end of the harrowing civil war that claimed so much German blood."
 bormann.6.a:0 "May the Reich prosper for one thousand years!"
 
 bormann.7.t:0 "Germania Decides to Fight!"
 bormann.7.desc:0 "Even though the last desperate holdouts continue to wage war on our army, we have considered ourselves victorious and turned our eyes to the last step to the much-needed reunification of the Fatherland - Speidel's Germania. As all of Germany simultaneously held its breath, Speidel decided the fate of Germania. The breath of the Fatherland was interrupted, however, with a punch to the stomach - Speidel has declared Germania will not stand down to Bormann and has ordered Germania to prepare for 'the final battle' with us. Such a battle does not look good for Germania - much of the Welthauptstadt is predicted to be destroyed in the fighting - and our citizens look on in horror. Although we are victorious, the olive dove has not rested just yet, and a final, decisive struggle must now begin for the fate of the nation we paid for so dearly in souls."
 bormann.7.a:0 "We will crush that 'general' into dust!" 

 bormann.8.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 bormann.8.d:0 "Unexpected news has reached us from Northern Germany today. It seems that the reformist liberals, led by the traitor Albert Speer, have approached us with an offer of ceasefire. Unfortunately, this is not because they wish to join our cause- rather, it is because a threat greater in their eyes than our faction has popped up.\n\nReinhard Heydrich, unquestionably one of the worst men in all of the Reich, has been steadily gaining power and influence while the other factions have fought with each other. He is now powerful enough to be a recognizable threat, on par with Goring and Speer. This has worried the Speerites, who are now approaching us with an offer to put aside our differences and destroy the common threat- that of the SS and their foul Burgundian System.\n\nOf course, it's a common belief among our soldiers that we could easily deal with SS rabble without the help of some student militias, but the freed up soldiers would certainly be quite the help in crushing this menace once and for all. It is our decision to make."
 bormann.8.a:0 "A ceasefire is appropriate."
 bormann.8.b:0 "We don't need their help."

 bormann.9.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 bormann.9.d:0 "Four men entered the battle for Germany's future, but most only thought there were three true contenders- Bormann, Goring, and Speer. The fourth, Heydrich, was widely seen as nothing more than a doomed breakaway, with no public support, little Heer support, and disconnected territory. Most discarded his candidacy from the start- certainly someone would crush him fast, and the nightmare would be over.\n\nUnfortunately, events have not gone the way we have expected. Heydrich is quickly gaining speed and momentum, and most recognize him as a real threat to take over Germany, despite the resistance of most of the people. As much as we hate our fellow competitors, we can all agree- Heydrich cannot be allowed to take control of the Reich, for he will certainly bring nothing but death and destruction to it.\n\nAs such, we have invited our challengers to a conference to negotiate a temporary "Anti-Heydrich Pact"- built not as a perfect solution to the Burgerkrieg, but as a means to stop Heydrich before he becomes too powerful for us to contain."
 bormann.9.a:0 "We must come together, or we will die."
 bormann.9.b:0 "We will never work with traitors!"
 
 bormann.10.t:0 "Goring Refuses"
 bormann.10.d:0 "Disappointingly, it seems that Goring's ego has won out over his brain. In an unsurprising, yet shockingly irritating message, Goring has refused to enter in a ceasefire with our faction, claiming that his Heer is more than sufficient to do the job. While not exactly an unexpected response from the famously aggressive man, it's a setback.\n\nWhile we are confident in the ability of our forces to defeat Heydrich and send him packing, it certainly would have been simpler if we could concentrate all of our forces on their frontline."
 bormann.10.a:0 " Can we truly agree on nothing?"

 bormann.11.t:0 "The Dutch send volunteers"
 bormann.11.d:0 "Now that the dust has settled in the RK Niederlande and Van Geelkerken is in charge, the new Dutch government has decided to gather and train a division of volunteers to send us."
 bormann.11.a:0 "Our thanks to the Dutch"
 
 bormann.12.t:0 "The Germania Corridor?"

 bormann.13.a:0 "Yes"

 bormann.13.c:0 "Maybe later"

 bormann.15.d:0 "Placeholder"
 bormann.15.a:0 "Quickly! To Germania!"
 bormann.15.b:0 "This is not in our interest."
 
 bormann.16.t:0 "The Obvious Outcome"
 bormann.16.d:0 "Earlier today, the city of Germania was finally taken by the 'rightful' heir of the late Adolf Hitler, Martin Bormann. Nothing short of 'predetermined destiny' being the reason for this capture has become the official party line. Whilst the other contenders may claim to be the true successor to our beloved late Führer, the fact is they simply are not, for how else would Bormann have achieved what they could not?\n\nHans Speidel, despite opposing us in Germania, was surely just mislead we are certain, and even he will be released from custody after this war has drawn to a close, courtesy of the personal intervention of Bormann of course. It is only a matter of time now before Germany is reunited and guided as a steady ship, for we do not need the reforms of Speer, the Spartanism of Heydrich, or the overzealous militarism of Göring; all we need is Martin Bormann, who we know will keep us on the truest path of what Hitler has left us with."
 bormann.16.a:0 "Guided to Victory!"

 bormann.26.t: "The Question of Slavery"
 bormann.26.desc: "The issue of slavery has long plagued the Reich. It is indubitable that the German is the master of Europe, and the Slav little more than a backwards animal; for these subhumans to toil at the behest of their Aryan conquerors is the natural outcome for Europe, as dictated by basic biology. Nonetheless, we must admit that slavery's impact on the economy has not necessarily been a positive one. The disgusting filth spewed by the traitor Speer, while being a total betrayal of National Socialism itself, may have held within a small nugget of truth. The overreliance on slaves has not helped the problem of unemployment among the lower classes, and boosting employment with unprofitable vanity projects may simply delay our economic issues. On average, the German man and woman are spending less and less as consumers, leading to some fears that the system of slavery as it stands could lead to the collapse of the German economy itself.\n\nThe Reich must make a stark choice regarding the status of slavery. As many conservatives within the Party are suggesting, the slave camps that were destroyed during the Bürgerkrieg should be rebuilt, and the Slavs kicked back to work. However, perhaps a more sensible compromise would be to halt the system of slavery and instead transfer these mongrels to isolated city ghettoes."
 bormann.26.a: "Send them to the ghettoes."
 bormann.26.b: "Compromise is for cowards. The slave camps must be rebuilt!"
 bormann.27.t: "Our Most Dangerous Issue"
 bormann.27.desc: "The Bürgerkrieg ripped the Fatherland apart limb from limb, and despite the Führer's selfless efforts to stitch the fractured remnants of the Reich back together, there are some wounds that still fester. If they are not treated soon, the body of the Reich will atrophy, and we may collapse into chaos yet again.\n\nThe men of the Wehrmacht may have sworn their oaths of loyalty towards the new Führer, but not all have sought to align themselves fully behind his wisdom. A faction of military reformists has coalesced around Hans Speidel, advocating for the total reinvigoration of the Wehrmacht, including a complete overhaul of military strategies and a professional, reduced draft. On the other end of the spectrum, Ferdinand Schörner has rallied his band of militarists, sabre-rattlers who desire an increased draft and a political role for the Wehrmacht.\n\nWhile Bormann would sooner trust a Swiss banker than these uniformed weasels, the Reich's wounds can only be healed with the support of one of these two influential factions. The clock is counting down, and the time draws near for the Führer to grit his teeth and do a deal with the devil."
 bormann.27.a: "But which devil?"
 #THE SHOWDOWN
 bormann.28.t: "A Meeting with the Wehrmacht's Leaders"
 bormann.28.desc: "Martin Bormann rubbed his eyes with a deep sigh. The days seemed to stretch out longer as the weeks went by. There were moments - fleeting, insignificant - when he imagined himself retiring to bed early in the evening, released of the crushing burden of preserving the Reich. He stared at the moonlight streaming in through the window, pooling across the floor towards his large oaken desk. When was the last time he had appreciated something as simple as a ray of moonlight?\n\n"Heil Bormann." The sleepy voice snapped him out of his ridiculous thoughts.\n\n"Heil Bormann," Bormann replied gruffly down the phone. "Herr Speidel, you are invited to a private meeting in the Reichskanzlei. I am willing to appoint a new Chief of the OKW if a persuasive case is presented to me. Ferdinand has already agreed to join us." Reluctantly, Bormann thought. Schörner's voice, at first so smug and satisfied at the invitation, had begun to radiate fury the moment Speidel's name was mentioned.\n\n"I understand, my Führer," Speidel's fatigued, mildly confused voice came after a brief pause. "Heil Bormann."\n\nBormann pushed the phone down with a grunt and once more his eyes drifted to the luminescent puddle transforming the ugly pattern of the rug into something surprisingly beautiful. Bormann pushed himself out of the chair, crossed the room, and flicked the light switch on. The moonlight vanished in an instant. He returned to his desk, picked up his pen and began to scribble. There was no time for such childish distractions.\n\nBormann had work to do."
 bormann.28.a: "The Meeting Awaits..."
 bormann.29.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Future Direction"
 bormann.29.desc: ""Enter!" Bormann barked, his gaze firmly fixed on the portrait of himself hanging on the wall. He heard the door open behind him, followed by two overlapping cries of "Heil, my Führer!" Bormann turned around towards the two uniformed officers, bespectacled snakes in the skin of lions.\n\n"Let's avoid the pleasantries, gentleman," Bormann said gruffly. "Sit down. We cannot delay this discussion any further. The Fatherland deserves a strong and stable army to defend its people and preserve its land. As your Führer, it is my duty to listen to your arguments." Bormann sat down in his chair and crossed his arms. "Convince me."\n\n"You have my gratitude for allowing us this opportunity, my Führer," Speidel spoke up, taking his seat at the table. "Only by reinvigorating and adapting the Wehrmacht to modern times can we help launch Germany into a new era of progress. We cannot allow the quagmire of the past to bog down our soldiers in the present. We must explore new tactics and new strategies. We need a total review of the Wehrmacht. Many competent and respected men who desire true reform have attached themselves to my ideals."\n\n"As they did to Speer's," Schörner sneered. "My Führer, is our army not the greatest in the world? Did we not crush the Allies and the Soviet Union? We have the greatest minds behind the greatest strategies, commanding the bravest and most noble of men in the world." Schörner thrust a finger towards Speidel. "This man and his clique of cowards would strip the Wehrmacht down to nothing in the name of 'reform'!"\n\nBormann sighed heavily as the two officers continued their arguing. This was going to be a long meeting..."
 bormann.29.a: "Spiedel is right. We need a total review of the Wehrmacht."
 bormann.29.b: "Schörner's logic is untouchable. Our Wehrmacht is already great!"
 bormann.30.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: Conscription"
 bormann.30.desc: ""Let us move onto our next topic," Bormann said, lighting up his cigar. "Conscription. Where do you stand?"\n\n"As I have already stated, my Führer," Schörner said, pushing his spectacles up his sharp nose, "our army's strategies have proven to be successful; however, an army is nothing without its personnel. The Reich is beset on all sides by threats, from the Jewish capitalists in Washington to the yellow powermongers of the Orient. What if they try to invade us? We cannot allow the fruits of our labour to be snatched away as our feeble Wehrmacht watches on." Schörner jabbed a finger on the table. "We need more conscripts!"\n\n"A bloated army is just as effective as a bloated solider," Speidel waved his hand dismissively. "It'll collapse under its own weight. A reduced draft will tighten our military, and then we can sensibly set about professionalising the Wehrmacht. Professional commanders and professional soldiers, not incompetent yes-men leading scared young cannon fodder. Our priorities should be quality, not quantity. It is necessary, therefore, that the new draft be voluntary - "\n\n"Voluntary?!" Schörner exploded into laughter and slapped the table heartily. "Forgive me, my Führer... but this man is suggesting that we take the honour and glory of battle away from the young men of the Reich! War is what turns us into heroes. Speidel would deprive the right of our citizens to fight alongside each other in favour of... what? A small cluster of so-called professionals?"\n\nBormann drummed his fingers against the table, brow furrowed in thought."
 bormann.30.a: "Speidel speaks the truth. We must prioritise the quality of the army over its quantity."
 bormann.30.b: "Schörner understands the military. A larger army is a mightier army."
 bormann.31.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Role of the Wehrmacht"
 bormann.31.desc: "Bormann rubbed his temples as the two men gestured and shouted. To have been Adolf Hitler in the glory days, surrounded by adulating columns of generals who hung onto his every pearl of wisdom... Watching these uniformed serpents argue who could hiss the loudest and bite the hardest made Bormann's stomach churn.\n\n"Enough!" Bormann snapped, mashing his third cigar into the ashtray. "It is time for us to address our final topic. What political position should the Wehrmacht have in our Greater Reich?"\n\n"It is my belief that the military should be an apolitical force within the Fatherland," Speidel stated. "It is the duty of the Wehrmacht to serve the nation and its people, not to lobby the government, and certainly not to pursue political agendas. If the military considers itself to be an equal to the Party, how long until it decides to become the Party itself?"\n\n"You are spouting lies as usual!" Schörner spat. "You, who would see the Wehrmacht treated as a mere tool, and not an instrumental force within our nation! If the Party is the head of the Reich, the Wehrmacht is its mighty fist: Together, we work in tangent to crush our enemies, but separated we all bleed out. The military should absolutely be political, and a true standard-bearer of National Socialist thought. An apolitical Wehrmacht would become a disloyal Wehrmacht.""
 bormann.31.a: "Speidel is right. The Wehrmacht should serve as an apolitical force."
 bormann.31.b: "Schörner is correct. A political Wehrmacht is one loyal to our cause."
 bormann.32.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Result"
 bormann.32.desc_speidel_victory: ""Silence!" Bormann raised his hand firmly and the two officers ceased their bickering. "I have made my decision. Herr Speidel, you are correct. It is time for true reform within the Wehrmacht to take place. Effective immediately, you will take the position of Chief of the OKW." Speidel allowed himself a satisfied smile and nodded slightly as Schörner's eyes widened in fury and his hands balled into fists.\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Speidel said, "for reaching your open hand out towards those in the Wehrmacht who desire positive change. You have my full support."\n\n"This is outrageous!" Schörner roared, shooting spittle across the table. He leapt up and slammed his fists against the wooden surface. He pointed accusingly at Bormann, drilling into him with burning eyes. "You have just let a traitor into your bed! A secret acolyte of Albert Speer himself!"\n\n"How fucking dare you!" Bormann shot to his feet, grabbed his ashtray and launched it towards the raging officer. Schörner ducked just in time to avoid the projectile. "Remember who you are speaking to, Ferdinand!"\n\n"I know exactly who I'm speaking to." Schörner stiffly brushed cigar ash off of his uniform. The sneer stretched across his face was all but treasonous. "Heil Bormann." With that, he marched out of the room.\n\nSpeidel quickly replaced his shocked face with a grateful one as he strolled over to Bormann with his arm outstretched. The Führer replied with a firm handshake and a forced smile."

"Herr Schörner, your proposals are the only path to a stronger Wehrmacht. Effective immediately, I appoint you Chief of the OKW." Schörner flashed a lopsided grin and jumped to his feet as Speidel slumped further down into his chair with an ashen face.\n\n"This is most... unfortunate," Speidel sighed. He slowly removed his round spectacles and rubbed his eyes. "I fear you have made the wrong decision, my Führer."\n\n"Is it not my decision to make?" Bormann snapped, slamming his fist onto the table. "Watch your fucking tongue!"\n\n"Apologies, my Führer," Speidel replied hastily. He shot a salute into the air. "Heil Bormann." Bormann returned the greeting with a stiff salute, and the officer nodded curtly and marched out of the room.\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Schörner said smugly, swaggering over to Bormann and shaking his hand vigorously.

The Reich's intelligence services are a mess, such was Hitler's way. He trusted no man with all that information. Well, Hitler was wrong, and it almost killed me.

It had taken far too many promises to evade the coup, ones he'd really rather not keep.\n\nHe picked up the papers and flicked through them. If there was no proof a promise had been made, it would simply be his word against theirs. And his word was the best in the Reich.

Why Bormann ever thought they could actually be reasoned with was beyond him now. It had been worth a try, at least, if only to spare a little Aryan blood.

With the army lacking the experienced counterintelligence network necessary to defend itself against us, it would be child's play to infiltrate its command structure and begin funnelling vital intelligence to the Wehrmacht. While some hawks believe they already have all the intel required on the Polish, their successful uprising has raised questions about our previous estimations of their fighting ability. Being able to accurately reassess it could save many German lives.\n\nAlternatively, we could adhere to the Wehrmacht's wishes and target the Polish logistics system, focusing our efforts on sabotage, misdirection and cutting supply lines.

Additionally, recent raids over the border by Polish terrorists - whether they are part of the Home Army, I cannot say - have provided us with concrete evidence of actual crimes. Needless to say, this is more than welcome, despite the loss of German lives involved. Not since the liberation of the Baltic have we possessed more ample evidence of our enemies' atrocities, real or otherwise.\n\nI have taken the liberty of procuring some slaves to provide our Orpo and Landser corpses.

However, by the day's dawn even the administrative center's most embittered cynics could do nothing but be stunned - if not be truly surprised - by the columns of armored vehicles and ranks of soldiers proceeding down the streets towards the city's center. Even though word had not been given directly to the public about their mission, it was obvious to all what the Wehrmacht had come to do.\n\nThe thunder of jetcraft rattled the government headquarters even as riflemen shouted orders at panicking security officers who, in the true spirit of the GGN, had not received warning from their superiors. By the end of the hour, Hans Frank's clique and all attached political officials had been - sometimes forcefully - placed under arrest and evicted from the centers of power in the Generalgouvernment. By the end of the day, NSDAP functionaries and other assorted party members had been installed throughout Krakau as the heads of the new Interinregierung and immediately set to work on their herculean task; dousing the political fires Hans Frank's clique had left to consume the entire administration."

A functionary of the Interinregierung might discover reports detailing a transfer of funds and personnel to a managerial department only for another functionary to find that same department having been consolidated into a completely unrelated bureau whose new records are kept using archiving methods that can only be described as 'labyrinthine'.\n\nThe remnants of the bureaucrats and secretaries of the administration have been less than cooperative as well. This is not due to some personal resistance to assisting our operation, but rather that those individuals know less about the overall picture than even our own functionaries and investigators. It has become torturously clear that the bloated departments of the GGN's administration must be entirely dissolved and reconstructed from the ground up if the region is ever to be brought into line with the basics of governmental standards and accountability, much less function in step with the Reich."

By all measure every last one of them was guilty of high crimes against the Reich and its peoples; embezzlement, fraud, dereliction of duty, even technical treason to the Vaterland, and each carried a very high price to the accused. These charges could not be dismissed, for as much as some in the NSDAP would wish to put the entire failure behind them, the citizens were incensed at the fact that on Germany's very doorstep such a national embarrassment was allowed to transpire at all, much less continue unabated for years.\n\nBormann stood from his desk and strode to the windows, considering the bustling sprawl of Germania and the Reich before him. The accused would be punished, but the question remained to what degree. Should they be subjected to the full purview of the law then the people of the Reich would be relieved and, perhaps most importantly, witness firsthand Bormann weeding out those corrupt officials and thereby cement his commitment to justice. However, there are notable members in the party who would take exception to such drastic punishments to their compatriots, and Bormann's control in the nation is not yet absolute. Inversely, letting the clique off with just a figurative black eye would endear a swath of the party to him and his judgement, though surely the people would not favor such a decision."

Still, if there was one thing the Führer knew above all else, it is that politics has a way of making a decision for you. Of all options, there were three men Bormann considered.\n\nFirst was Eduard Wagner, the man responsible for The Reich's logistics during the Second World War and a notable militarist. The GGN is vital to the Reich logistically, and accordingly Wagner will excel in such a position, though he will have to step down from his military rank to receive it. Second is Theodor Koch, the industrialist of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring company. The GGN has untapped industrial potential and a savvy man like Koch will handle the aforementioned logistics well. Finally, Werner Dollinger, a reformist and famous Bavarian economist, would perform admirably in reconstructing the economic prospects of the GGN itself.\n\nBormann brought the phone to his lips, paused, and came to a decision."

His denunciations have evidently hit a chord with much of the German navy, particularly those who had been feeling uneasy about publicly choosing a side in the civil war, offering an apparently 'neutral' face-saving alternative. A fanciful story has even begun to circulate about four sailors from Wilhelmshaven who jumped overboard and swam over a mile to land when the captain announced his support for Albert Speer instead of Dönitz.\n\nWith ships from across the Reich rallying to Dönitz's banner, and therefore, to ours, prospects are looking increasingly dim for the other contenders."

 #Bormann Bohemia Events
 bormann.600.t:0 "Ehre wen Ehre Gebührt"
 bormann.600.desc:0 "The Bohemian garrison had an unenviable position even before the civil war. Despite lying at the heart of the Reich they were plagued by partisans, the Czechs simply refusing to give up in the face of destruction. Ironically this turmoil spared them from involvement in the bitter power struggle of the rest of Germany, and the chaos that overtook the Reich evidently did more harm to the partisans than it did to the garrison. Holding on by tooth and claw, the beleaguered garrison took back the countryside and hunted them down one by one. Now, Bohemia is ready to return to the fold. \n\nFührer Bormann has praised the actions of the loyal soldiers of the Reich cut off from the Fatherland; and to the Governor whose leadership kept them from straying with a new set of medals commissioned for the defenders of Bohemia. Finally, the Reich's first conquest will be completed."
 bormann.600.a:0 "Honour to whom honour is due."

 bormann.601.t:0 "New Orders"
 bormann.601.desc:0 "The garrison in our protectorate of Böhmen-Mähren has triumphed over the pesky partisans that assaulted them during the GCW. While this saves us from another expensive police action, it also presents a potentially dangerous political precedent.\n\nThe garrison has reformist tendencies and Prague isn't that far from Germania. We could just redeploy them to some far off corner of the Reich to limit their impact of course, but then the reformists in the overall Heer would be denied a triumph they achieved.\n\nOr we could grant them their propaganda victory. Of course, this would further the impression that it is the Wehrmacht, not Führer Bormann who is the one in the driver's seat."
 bormann.601.a:0 "These soldiers must be stationed far away from Germania to contain their influence."
 bormann.601.b:0 "These Czechs have proven their Germanization in defeating the SS. They can stay."

 bormann.602.t:0 "The Truth Bbout the Bohemian Partisans"
 bormann.602.desc:0 "With the Bohemian situation finally being sorted out, Bormann has ordered an investigation into the partisans that gave the garrison so much trouble.\n\nThe results were unsettling to say the least.\n\nIt had been widely suspected that die hard Czech and Polish resistance groups had somehow struck from Sudeten and Carpathian holdouts, but every investigated group showed the same picture:\n\nAn empty shell, cleansed of actual Czechs years, maybe even decades ago - what filled them were SS members in disguise. While one or two groups might have been little surprise considering Himmler's usual machinations, EVERY SINGLE GROUP in the entire partisan front was secretly marching under the black sun.\n\nNeedless to say, this revelation has caused widespread shock, outrage and alarm among the Reich's society. After all if the SS can do this, then how many other SS underground organisations are there?"
 bormann.602.a:0 "How deep does Himmler's network run?!"

 bormann.603.t:0 "The Takeover"
 bormann.603.desc:0 ""Beautiful isn't it? The von Krosigk dynasty has had it in it's possession since at least the Napoleonic wars" Johann Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk offhandedly gestured to the painting in his bureau as he led the Führer into his office.\n\n"I am not here to look at oil paintings Krosigk", Bormann's patience was already thin, even though their talk hadn't even properly begun.\n\nThey stayed silent for a moment, as the door behind them was closed by an aide. Von Krosigk began to talk, but was quickly silenced. Bormann's tone and demeanor was more like an animal hunting its prey than human.\n\n"Do you really expect a chance to keep your position Krosigk? There is none. I know you, better than you think. I know your Speerist sympathies. I know the "compromises" you made. I know that you have been a spineless remnant of the Weimar system for far too long, that should have been out of power when you failed the Reich in the 50's."\n\n"And yet I am the reason you aren't fighting the SS in Prague." Krosigk's defiance was measured but precise.\n\n"And that is the only reason I am letting you leave this place standing on your feet. And you will leave, make no mistake. Live the rest of your days with your family. Do NOT get in my way." Bormann casually placed his hand on the holster.\n\nThe rest of the talk was much more... smooth. In the end von Krosigk handed over power quietly."

 bormann.604.desc:0 "The camera flash lit up the walls of Prague castle, as Führer Bormann and Krosigk exited after several hours of negotiations. Clasping hands in a firm shake, their smiles showed the negotiations had been a success. The crowd roared as theatrically placed swastika banners rolled down the wall in bright scarlet.\n\nBormann's handling of the negotiations has been praised by the party apparatus for his bloodless ending to the longstanding Bohemia problem, and the streets of Germania have been filled with cheers at another successful acquisition for the Reich."

 bormann.605.t:0 "A Shadow Hangs over Bohemia"
 bormann.605.desc:0 "Bohemia has been set apart from the Reich's heartland for years, long set back in its planned integration by the incessant partisan activity that plagues the countryside. The outbreak of civil war did the garrison no favours, and cut off from supply and reinforcement, they began to falter. Reinhard Heydrich's legacy is not dead in Bohemia, and the SS garrison stationed in Bohemia revealed their true shade of black when they overthrew the Governor, placing the entirety of the province under martial law.\n\nNow that the civil war is over, preparations have begun to eradicate the SS from the Czech Lands and complete the conquest that has been long left unfinished. That the war can be won is not in doubt - the decision to be made is what must be sacrificed. If we take the longer route we could cripple the SS before the invasion even begins, saving vital industry but risking making us look overcautious. An all out assault would bring us glory in the eyes of the German people, but prized Bohemian factories would be crippled."

However, when one is strong they should appear weak, so whilst the OKW generals may whine at not getting to implement their "masterful works of co-ordinated Schwerpunkt", the Führer can rest easy knowing that his choice is the right choice.\n\nWhile the Heer postures against the SS at the border, agents have already begun penetrating Bohemian front lines. Taking note of force concentrations, artillery emplacements, and bunkers that would make a First World War general turn tail and run, their information gently trickles back through to the less outspoken generals, those more willing to trust in the Führer's vision. These generals selflessly compile their own, more refined plans for invasion.\n\nMassed airstrikes to the big guns will leave them as piles of scaffolding, while slipping between the rigid SS ranks to take them from the sides like Hannibal will dismantle them faster than a concentration camp doctor. And bunkers are all too stationary. Their surrender is inevitable when they are a black island in a sea of grey."

Now that we know all the best defensive positions we can deny them to our enemy by bombing them into oblivion. The SS may know how to build a bunker but we most certainly know how to destroy one.\n\nWho are they going to complain to when they hear the scream of the dive bomber above their heads? Certainly not the Burgundians, for they maintain their status as member of the Reich as a paper shield as much as possible. Bohemia is on it's own, and we can poke and prod at them until the moment we are confident enough to step foot on their soil, for there is no nation in the world foolish enough to say the Czech Lands are not under German dominion. Keep poking until they stop paying attention. Then, wipe them out."

 bormann.609.t:0 "Bohemian Standoff"
 bormann.609.desc:0 "Bohemia lies under siege. The Luftwaffe diligently turns away any Burgundian attempts at resupplying their erstwhile ally, and at the border Bohemian and German stare at each other with ever-tightening grips on their rifles. The buildup has begun, and the generals of the OKW have eagerly begun drawing up their plans, keen to demonstrate the lessons learned in the crucible of war to their once-comrades.\n\nReports show that the SS garrison mustered quickly to man their border over the course of several days. It must have been a humbling sight to them to see their numbers matched, and then exceeded, and then dwarfed by the slow muster of German troops in feldgrau from across the Reich. In stark contrast to the exhaustion and weariness that seemed to plague the Heer when fighting on German soil, the men have gained a zeal unheard of since the West Russian War. It is an enlightening experience to have a true enemy, an enemy that is without doubt evil - an enemy you can hate."
 bormann.609.a:0 "Hatred - an emotion as pure as it is deep."

 bormann.610.t:0 "Fall, Anthropoid"
 bormann.610.desc:0 "No longer can we tolerate SS dogs in the Reich. Himmler's thugs have been undermining our efforts for countless years, and in their cowardly style only now revealed their true faces. They may call for aid from their master, but so long as Germany separates Bohemia from Burgundy their cries will go unheard.\n\nWhilst the SS have been busy fighting their little guerilla war, we have fought total war. We will see how well hiding in the trees serves them when the forests burn in napalm fire; how lurking in basements serves them when missiles dig their graves; how the loyalty of a dog defeats the courage of men. They are not men, but blonde beasts in the form of men, and it is long time they were put down.\n\nHangmen, butchers, evil geniuses. They have outlived their usefulness. Begin the invasion."

 bormann.611.desc:0 "The voice boomed from the TV:\n\n"Today, we free a province of the Reich from betrayal and corruption."\n\nRow upon row of gallows flicked over the TV screen.\n\n"Hitler once trusted these men, to be his vanguard..."\n\nHundreds of SS-men, captured during the final assault stood there, nooses around their neck.\n\n"But just like Himmler himself, they had only their self interest at heart!"\n\nBags of cloth covered their heads. And each shabby prison suit they wore had a black triangle stitched upon them, the concentration camp badge for asocials.\n\n"Their self-interest was power. The power to enslave us to their cult of death..."\n\nNow the Orpo agents stepped forward, each one ensuring that gallow was prepared in such a way as to make the death as slow and gruesome as possible. They were quickly ready.\n\n"Just as they laid waste to the Reich, we shall lay waste to them, let us show Himmler, that we do not fear him!"\n\nHundreds of times the holes opened, hundreds of times the bodies fell. And hundreds of times an SS-man would slowly choke to his death.\n\nAll across Bohemia the remnants of the SS shared the same fate. The event was broadcast not just throughout the Pakt, but special care was taken that all of Burgundy could be reached by the TV signals as well. But from Burgundy there was only silence, it almost seemed like they were... apathetic?"

 bormann.620.desc:0 "Sources exclusive to the Völkischer Beobachter report that with the end of civil conflict within the Reich's heartland the Kriegsmarine currently stationed in Krim are making preparations for their return to Germany. Admiral Karl Dönitz, who commanded that the fleet be removed from Germany during the conflict in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, reportedly approves of Führer Bormann's succession and his heartfelt work to restore peace.\n\nAdmiral Dönitz's reputation precedes him, and few of the pretenders voiced objections at his absence, either fearing his ire should he turn his fleet's guns upon them or foolishly hoping to curry favour in the event of their victory. The Admiral held true however, refusing to put his ships at risk for any other than the rightful Führer.\n\nThe Führer is expected to roll out the red carpet for his friend and ally, and no doubt honours are in order. Readers with sons in the Kriegsmarine will now doubt be relieved to know that our boys are coming home."

 bormann.621.desc:0 "The harbour at Wilhelmshaven had not been so full in years. The bustling activity of the Jade Bight had been driven to a frantic dash for position against the vast warships that had taken over the harbour, sitting there like great grey icebergs. The Kriegsmarine, long absent from the frantic battle that had defined their recent times, had returned.\n\n"-dark times, the darkest the Reich has seen in decades. In dark times, hard choices must be made - a man must realise that his own ego is of no importance in comparison with the existence of the nation. Admiral Dönitz knew there was no honour in his choice to remove the Kriegsmarine from the war, but he knew it was the choice necessary for the good of his Fatherland. That is true honour."\n\nDönitz and Bormann stood side by side, their podium sufficiently far from the audience that none could see the Führer's sideways glance or the admiral's hint of a scowl. It was a day of peace after all, and people were looking forward rather than at the cracks in the wall they stood on."

 bormann.622.desc:0 "With the departure of the Kriegsmarine from Theoderichshafen, the greatest port in the Black sea fell silent. The port made up the overwhelming majority of employment in the city, be it directly through the thousands of dockers and stevedores that serviced the bloated ships that usually occluded the horizon from vision like oceangoing skyscrapers; or indirectly, in the countless beer halls, restaurants and whorehouses that had sprung up since the peninsula was wrestled from its' Slavic occupiers. Whilst the departure of the fleet may have caused a brief economic crisis amongst the citygoing Germans, the disappearance of drunken sailors marked for the few remaining Ukrainians a rare moment of respite from robbery and rape.\n\nNot for long, however. The departure of the Kriegsmarine was not an ending but another beginning, a reconnection with the Reich. The warships returned in fewer numbers, but accompanied by countless other vessels with shipments of bureaucrats and other, useful supplies. With the connection to Germany restored, Krim now has both a navy to maintain in fighting fitness and the funds to do it."

However, I am willing to compromise." The Führer leaned forward to meet the Dutchman's steely glare. "Independent press may exist, yes, but it will be heavily regulated, and will not critique your administration, the Pakt or the Reich.

Taking advantage of the brutal Bürgerkrieg that ravaged the Reich, the Dutch tyrant Henk Feldmeijer seized power with his SS henchmen, threatening to deliver the land to Himmler. There is no negotiation or compromise to be had with these madmen. Just as Heydrich was crushed, we will destroy Feldmeijer's pathetic little army and hang him like a filthy dog.\n\nBefore we declare war, however, we must determine how best to conduct our invasion. Many generals have pointed towards 'Operation Blauer Rhein', a standard invasion strategy drawn up years ago in the event of a Dutch rebellion. The Führer has also been approached with 'Operation Grüner Rhein', a more ferocious plan dedicated to destroying the SS swiftly and mercilessly by treating all Dutchmen as potential enemies. This plan involves mass collateral damage and the destruction of dams to wipe out the enemy, which will doubtless stir fury among the native Dutch.\n\nThe former plan is safer and more merciful, but mercy is not a word to be used when discussing the SS. As for the latter plan, it will ensure such a violent destruction of the SS that Himmler himself will not dare interfere in any more of our territories but may herald uncertain long-term consequences."

Hertzog and the Boers have proven to be a useful ally and will provide us with a loyal state when this war is over, of that I am certain.

From what I understand, Hüttig, Schenck and Müller all expected a swift and relatively costless victory over South Africa."\n\n"And then Nixon intervened?" Bormann raised an eyebrow.\n\n"And then Nixon intervened. American propaganda is referring to South Africa as a 'domino' that will soon fall to National Socialism unless they provide military assistance, and their troops are proving to be determined and brutal in combat. The South Africans have hardly been feeble opponents, either."\n\n"They are of Anglo-Saxon blood. It should not surprise us that Germanics would resist us so effectively."

Schenck and Müller had also remained neutral, it was true, but out of sheer pragmatism. As far as Bormann was concerned, Hüttig's loyalties lay elsewhere.\n\nThe phone clicked.\n\n"Heil Bormann!" came the clipped voice of the Reichskommissar. "Did you receive my formal congratulations on your success in the Bürgerkrieg?"\n\n"I did not. There is much I did not receive from you, Reichskommissar." There was a brief pause.\n\n"I took it as a point of principle to maintain neutrality. It would be a threat to Ostafrika's stability if its leadership were to make such a dangerous gamble." Bormann ground his teeth but did not reply. "I understand this call concerns the war?"\n\n"Yes. We must... work together if we are to defeat the capitalists. The Reich shall be providing aid to each of the Reichskommissariats to ensure a German victory in the Dark Continent."\n\n"Aid would be much appreciated," Hüttig growled.

Any advancing South Africans or Americans who dare to cross into Ostafrikan territory will be torn apart in swift and fiery revenge. As well as damaging our foes and slowing their advance, it will act as the perfect psychological weapon. Not a single enemy soldier will escape the chilling fear that every step forward could be their last.\n\nWhile our military forces in Afrika have been educated regarding these extensive plans, there have been a few casualties from civilians stepping on anti-personnel mines.

"Your investments in the Sudwestafrikan Luftwaffe ensures our ability to control the skies over South Africa. However, you seem to have invested a little too much.

Müller's cheery voice made Bormann grind his teeth. As annoying as the man was, he had admittedly proven himself to be a valuable asset to the Reich.\n\n"Yes, yes," Bormann replied hastily. "There is no time for pleasantries, I'm afraid. There is much to discuss. The Reich must coordinate its efforts with Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika if we are to prevail in this war. Our generals will work together to organize strategy, and I will send some weapons and men to boost your army."\n\n"Excellent!" Müller exclaimed with a laugh. "I must confess, I was rooting for you throughout the Bürgerkrieg. No other Führer would bother helping us in the struggle against these unruly South Africans, I guarantee it."\n\nBormann sighed. Sycophancy had been another one of his many skills, and he certainly knew how to detect it in other people.

Whether they were soldiers or politicians, Göringite militarists or Speerian liberals – in the camp, they were one.\n\nThe camp commandant marched over to the huddled mass with a group of officers. In that moment, were it not for the guards, Joachim would have murdered the commandant for his gloves and coat. The uniformed commandant looked at the men with distaste and bellowed in a gravelly voice.\n\n"Listen up, you treacherous rats! On the orders of the Führer, I am officially offering you a path towards redemption." He paced up and down the line of prisoners, eying each one up as if they were slabs of meat in a butchery. His cold eyes drilled into Joachim's, who shuddered even more violently. "The South African War rages on, and the Reich is sending troops to aid the Reichskommissars in their struggle. If any man wishes to seek penance for their treason, they will be transported to Africa immediately. If you refuse, well... depending on the severity of your crimes, you will serve the Reich in a distant labor camp or you will serve the Reich in front of a shooting squad. Any man brave enough to serve the Reich in battle, however, will step forwards now!"\n\nJoachim groaned softly. The Bürgerkrieg had been arduous enough, but it had never stripped him of his dignity like imprisonment.

"Yes, my Führer. Norway has been limited in production of food since the medieval era, and it will never be able to approach continental lands in production, for example. By 'insisting' on forced agrarianism for the Norwegians, not only are they fighting an uphill battle with the arable land and the terrorists, as you've said, but they are also fighting against a lack of proper carbohydrates.

"Of course, of course. Now tell me, Lunde- what is it you would wish to change? Industrialization? A defense force? Say what it is, and I'm sure we can deliver."\n\n"Well."Lunde thought for a moment. "I'm not sure how positively you'll react to what I say here, my friend." He smiled.\n\n"Oh, come on. You'll never know until you say it."The diplomat replied again. Lunde breathed in, steeling himself.\n\n"I believe that Norway should be independent of direct German rule. We've proven ourselves loyal, we've proven that we can defend ourselves, and we've proven that Norway, by and large, supports the Aryan ideal. It seems only fair that we gain something in return for our steadfast support, and autonomy- real autonomy, not the fake client states that you held over Serbia and Bulgaria- seems like a good compromise, does it not?"\n\nThe diplomat stared at Lunde like he had two heads. Finally, after an agonizing wait, he stammered a reply."

Circling around him were several men, all leading figures of the National Socialist and Pro-German factions in Norway; many were wary of Herr Schmidt, yet others were gleeful at the prospect of securing The Reich's support in their efforts.\n\nSmoke blew from the shadowy man's mouth as he leaned into the light and regarded the others. "You've done well for yourselves, and you've done well for Norway, nothing can be more true. Even still, it has not been enough. With every passing day, the weak men in government degrade all that National Socialism has done for Norway. With every month, the wolf of bolshevism creeps closer to destroying everything that is good and right, and your government gladly leaves the door open to it. You know it, the people of Norway know it, and, luckily for us all, the Reichstag knows it too. Today I bring you a proposal. My superiors and the highest echelons of power in The Reich wish to see Norway set free again; you do as well, more than anyone. Within a matter of months, this can be true not just in our hearts and minds, but in the streets and the halls of government as well."\n\nA short drag, and a finale. "Any questions?""

 bormann.1053.desc:0 "Before the sun rose in Oslo, another struggle for the soul of our nation was already underway. Pro-German fascists and national socialists have emerged in the capitol and marched on the Storting, the supreme legislature of Norway. While the city's police forces rapidly deployed a response, Norwegians loyal to Germany have already blocked off roads and bridges across the city with vehicles and makeshift barriers. Inside the houses of government, armed fascist paramilitaries are attempting to find and seize particular representatives and heads of government; by and large these attempts have been met with failure as a last-minute tip off sent several of the legislature's members into hiding, although the putschits have already begun "prosecuting" those they've managed to find so far.\n\nOutside the city proper, ad hoc militias are being formed as the news spreads to the rest of the country and citizens discover the fragility of their liberty. Brawls and light skirmishes have already begun devolving into open gunfights in and around the city-under-siege even as military formations form up outside the city and prepare to deploy. Still, whispers of traitors and hidden pro-german elements have stalled confidence in the ability of the guard to put an end to this threat, to say nothing of its ability to actually engage with the coup's potent German support. Regardless, the current equilibrium cannot be maintained; as the military and citizens already fight tooth and nail against the storming of the capitol, the pro-Germans and fascists are rounding up the last heads of state as hostages. All that remains to be seen is the soul of the nation and the will of the people."

Eventually, military and diplomatic messages were broadcast across Norway declaring a national emergency and warning the remainder of the Norwegian government and military about an attempted coup. Finally, word was received from our intelligence services that the putschists have failed to resist the police and military crossing into the city, and resulted in the loyalists being arrested or shot to a man.\n\nWhile our professional intelligence services assure us that no physical trace was left to connect us officially to the attempt, it is more than likely that coup members will confess and implicate us at the highest echelons.\n\nAnother swathe of Germany's lands have against all reason fallen away from the guiding light of the Fatherland; it is time to ensure it never happens again. The Führer is already meeting with the General Staff and Kriegsmarine to employ all possible options to guarantee a nation hostile to The Reich does not lie at it's very doorstep."

Even now, the putschists have begun detaining the previous members of government, and evidently also those citizens who did not make their loyalties clear during the coup itself. Our contacts in the new regime assure us that in the coming days the entire nation will be under their control and order and stability will reign once more in Norway.\n\nThis is a momentous occasion; not only will we be able to maintain our military presence in the Arctic and North Seas with the benefit of Norwegian bases, economic utilization of the region will also be able to continue as planned. Further still, we have demonstrated to both ourselves and the world the strength of National Socialism and denied our enemies a safe haven on our doorstep.

All of this masqueraded equipment was bound to be offloaded and distributed at a quiet Norwegian port before being transported to hidden pro-German elements across the nation. Unfortunately however as a result of fate, ill luck, heightened Norwegian security, or the simple conspicuousness of so much unmarked cargo in one place, the transportation authorities in Norway discovered and intercepted our shipment and locked down regional trade and delivery upon its discovery. Though the firearms were unmarked and the equipment unremarkable, it is all but guaranteed that the Norwegian government now knows of the ongoing mobilization of pro-German loyalists within their borders, as well as our likely involvement.\n\nThis will not stop us.\n\nOur intelligence services are already burning any documents the Norwegians could find and our shipping manifestos are being altered to hide any potential discovery of further action.

It does not require an intelligent man to determine that the Noregian government knows that something is going on and are increasing counter-intelligence capabilities to try and flush it out. Given the rate at which we are preparing the groundwork for operations within the nation it is not surprising their officials would begin to catch on eventually, but we must maintain diligence at all times. Our preparations are not complete and local loyalists are not nearly organized enough to emerge in force, and so we must instruct them to continue their tasks as normal and not draw undue attention.\n\nEveryday we approach closer to operational readiness is a day closer to discovery; the longer it takes, the more likely we will be discovered. Conversely, if we do not plan accordingly and provision effectively, all our efforts will be for nought.

As soon as the message was decrypted, our fears were unfortunately confirmed.\n\nOur operative was tailed by Norwegian agents and tracked to the local pro-German loyalist meeting place. Our man managed to escape and set the building on fire in his evasion, but now direct evidence of our sympathizer's organization is suspected and being examined for further information at this very moment. A few similar messages began filtering in soon after, and many of our contacts are not responding at all. We've transmitted messages to all cells to go-to-ground and maintain operational silence until we can present them a solution. Unfortunately, there are scant few solutions to a hostile nation aware a conspiracy is ongoing right beneath their noses.\n\nWe are beginning to run out of time and our schedule must be accelerated as a result. We must increase shipment quantity and move our units into position while we still have the advantage of surprise. We are rapidly approaching the resolution to this little hunt, and we do not intend to be its prey."

The loyalist hideout for the putschists was infiltrated by the Norwegian security apparatus early this morning, just as a meeting involving several head figures in the pro-German movement was concluding. Light automatic gunfire was exchanged with the police before the building was stormed and almost every operative within has been captured or killed in the gunfight.\n\nReports are spotty at best, but it would appear that Herr Schmidt did make it out alive, if barely; unfortunately he is not our primary concern. Those members of the conspiracy who were captured do not have the express loyalty nor the advanced interrogation resistance techniques to ensure they do not reveal our secrets. Further, since the day's meeting was critical, significant quantities of vital - and directly incriminating - documents and communiques were on the site during the raid and were unable to be removed or destroyed before Herr Schmidt's exfiltration. Our intelligence analysts have determined that Norway is absolutely cognisant of our efforts and is by the minute discovering just how extensive it truly was.\n\nThis is likely the death-knell of the prospective coup; the only course of action available now is to retrieve any and all assets we can and hide or destroy those we cannot. While our agent is being smuggled out of the country, the Führer is to be informed directly and presented with available options moving forward."

 bormann.1060.desc:0 "After years of exploration and prospecting, a vast oil reserve has been discovered in the North Sea. At first thought to be a fool's errand, exploration increased after finding natural gas in Germany's western-most Reichskommissariat in the early 1960s. Since then, private investors from both Norway and Germany have been looking for precious black gold offshore, following and prospecting the Norwegian Continental Shelf.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of costly drilling, they finally did it. Located on the southern tip of the shelf, the wealth that had been found under the sea is seemingly boundless. Geologists now even believe that there is more oil; much more lining huge swaths of the Norwegian coasts, waiting to be discovered. As of now, just the reserves that have been discovered are the largest offshore deposits in the world, to the elation of both Germans and Norwegians.\n\nIt is yet to be seen how the two will proceed from here, but oil reserves could give both economies a huge boost. Norway in particular could see huge economic benefits and some much needed industry and diversification, but must also consider Germany's interests. Nonetheless, this provides a much needed resource for both nations."

 bormann.1062.desc:0 "News from Berlin does not tend to be good news. Just today, we have been presented with an opportunity to see if this axiom is proven true once more.\n\nThe ministry of foreign affairs informs us they have just received a diplomatic invitation from Germany to renegotiate and reevaluate our "relationship" with them; in light of our people's history with one another it is a bold step for the Germans to say the absolute least. However, it is more than clear that The Reich does not handle failure and loss well, and by accepting this potential olive branch we could begin working to avoid any diplomatic - or military - incidents in the immediate future.\n\nThis a purely preliminary message; the place and time, and even the attendees, have not been specified in the text itself, though the message attempts to assure us that it will be given all due consideration on both sides. Regardless, this does place the Prime Minister in a rather delicate position. For decades our people have had the Nazi boot stamped on our throats, and there are many in the nation and government who would gladly fight the German rather than speak with them; but as much as some of our more recalcitrant citizens might wish for our two nations to glower and scowl at each other from across the sea, this is not a viable long term solution.\n\nFurther still, while we have succeeded in throwing off the tyrant's yoke once, our current military forces are infantile compared to the bloated German war machine; perhaps a treaty would do what a division of tanks could not?"

Words such as sovereignty, dignity, rights, interests, and more adorn the letter from top to bottom, notably all in contrast of or in reference to us. Ignoring their attempts at diplomatic insults, the contents of the letter is in fact quite promising! They seem to have accepted our overtures at diplomatic negotiations and are interested in pursuing a formal meeting between our representatives, preferably as soon as we are able. Though much work now lays between us and a successful conference with the Norwegians, this is an excellent first step towards managing control of the region. Not only does this spare us engaging military forces in Scandinavia, it indicates that the Norwegians are aware of their precarious position and seek to avoid any overt conflict, in politics or otherwise. This gives us the obvious advantage. Even so, there could be wisdom in refraining from pushing them too hard with any demands, for if they don't maintain their display of 'sovereignty' they might be pushed to abandon the negotiations altogether and force more... unsavory methods at resolution.\n\nRegardless of the goal, all that we need to do now is put on a smile, act polite, and engage in some bloodless - if not painless - realpolitik."

A response from the Norwegian foreign minister arrived today with their answer, and to call it a cold response would be a mild assessment.\n\nThough the language they used was colorful at times in its declination of our offer, they refrained from anything that would force the  Führer on the warpath should he read the text itself, though only just barely. The closing statement of the missive in fact reads that their "...inherent rights of national sovereignty and dignity were demonstrated quite clearly once, and the German people surely do not need to be reminded again", to clear any lingering doubt about the message's true meaning.\n\nIt surprised no one in Germania that the Norwegians resented us, this much was known, but what no one was truly ready to accept was the possibility that they'd spit on the hand holding the olive branch. Their nation is unstable and their ability to resist an invasion is feeble at best; it's difficult to determine if this is a calculated move or a flash of madness.\n\nUltimately, all this does is narrow down our choice of response. Norway is valuable, in resources and strategic position, but we must determine if it's value is greater or lesser than the effort it would take to retrieve it; and yet still another variable in this equation of state is the insult this refusal's very existence imposes on us.

Advocating for this locale will be seen as advocating for a position of strength to the German people and - more importantly - our support in the halls of government. Bringing the Norwegians to our table in our territory will please our supporters to no end, though Norway will take notable offence at the suggestion and the signalling of the lack of neutrality.\n\nThe second option, suggested both by the Norwegians and our intelligence services, is Oslo. Going to the home of our opponents after they detached themselves from us might signal weakness to some in Germany, but it will undoubtedly foster goodwill and bring them to believe we are sincere in our purpose. Further, if negotiations sour, our presence in the capitol will embolden our loyalists in Norway and perhaps assist in future operations in the area.\n\nFinally, as an overture to the spirit of good faith, the conference can be held at Göteborg in Sweden. This is a neutral meeting place and, with the Swedes acting as moderators, will be seen by both Norway and Sweden as a commitment to improving relations in all of Scandinavia, though perhaps less intently than if we simply went to Oslo."

Germany, a superpower by right, has come in the interest of peace in Scandinavia and laying the foundation for relations to last the remainder of its 'thousand years'. Norway, a land who just months ago was under the thumb of the Nazi hegemony, successfully slipped its bonds and comes to fortify its future in the shadow of the goliath. Though the haggling of details leading up to the conference might've seemed like a battle, it is waged in the name of avoiding a war. By extending one another the olive branch it is hoped that the swords will stay in their sheaths, though if their animosities flare there is no telling what will become of the Scandinavian peninsula.\n\nFor now though, the opening ceremony and first rounds of negotiations, both in front of cameras and behind closed doors, will proceed in the hopes of peace over the coming days.

The German military is relaxing along the North Sea, and the Norwegian people are collectively breathing a sigh of relief for perhaps the first time in decades. The Prime Minister of Norway has lauded the ambassadors who attended the conference and spoken publicly in support of the results, whilst simultaneously the Führer has paraded this diplomatic victory to the acclaim of Germania. Though the true opinions of the delegates and ambassadors will forever be veiled behind their smiles, it would seem they too are looking forward to furthering their craft and normalizing relations between their nations.\n\nAlready, newsprinters across Europe and the world relay the revelations; all look towards the German and Scandinavian spheres with new interest."

The lead negotiators themselves have been found in diametrically opposed positions, neither side willing to give ground in the arbitration, and what was once thought to be the hope of peace in Scandinavia has come crashing down around them. Simple disagreements have become verbal disputes, and verbal disputes have, in at least one instance, become physical altercations.\n\nThroughout the negotiations the ambassadors generally managed to maintain propriety and politeness, but the uncompromising nature of the latest round of discussion laid bare the contempt each side had for the others' position. As one particularly recalcitrant pair of junior delegates had to be pulled apart, the signal that this attempt at compromise would never bear fruit was clear for all to see, and the Norwegian delegation left the conference in practiced defiance.\n\nBoth parties now return to their seats of power, empty in hand and low on patience; a microcosm of their respective nations' attitudes towards one another. It is difficult to know what comes next for Northern Europe but if this struggle is any indication, all signs point to further conflict."

This was one of our most desired goals of the conference, and to gain it in full is a boon we will not squander.\n\nAside from the material military benefits this affords us, it also grants us great political power both within Norway and Germania. With garrisons throughout the nation we will be able to resist Norway potentially distancing itself in the future, and by securing these basing rights the admiralty won't be able to say we do not support them."

Though attempts were made at discovering how flexible the term 'permanent garrison' could be, it seems that the Scandinavians have little to no interest in stationing German armed forces on their land. This is undoubtedly a result of previous military traumas in Norway, and it is unlikely that they can be made to freely come to terms on this issue.\n\nHowever, it could still be possible to wean them towards accepting the basing of 'military sailors' in camps 'near' the ports themselves. While it's unlikely we could get away with hosting an armored company, this potential compromise would allow us to maintain some degree of direct military control should the need arise, all while maintaining the Norwegians' sense of sovereignty. We've gotten them to accept most of our demands so far, and pushing further on this will surely test our diplomatic abilities, but leaving Norway without a direct Heer presence - no matter how small - is incompatible with the region's continued stability."

Even though we have been generous in accepting the Kriegsmarine basing in our waters and dockyards, the Germans are still demanding we also allow the rest of their armed forces full garrison rights.\n\nOnce we had drawn up the language concerning the docking rights we anticipated the rest of this matter to follow smoothly, but their zealous insistence that both of our 'national securities' rest entirely on the presence of German jackboots in Norway has sought to evaporate all of our diplomatic gains thus far. We've only just thrown off the pointless and harmful shackles of the German, and inviting their tanks back into our towns is no different than inviting the Swastika back into the Storting. Not only is this untenable to our ambassadors and delegates, the common people would resent any such concession, seeing as they bore the brunt of the German's weight in the occupation.\n\nAny attempt at compromise disintegrates on both sides, and the Germans' calls for acceptance only grow louder by the hour. With no immediate solution presenting itself, we are stuck at an impasse. We can swallow our pride and assent to allow the Germans to occupy strategic locations within Norway, in the hopes that the Germans do not renege on the accords, or we can let the conference crumble around this seemingly intractable issue."

Instead of full garrison rights for the Nazi military, they request that 'military sailors' be allowed to station in 'camps' near the Kriegsmarine in the ports and harbors. Their intent is still clear, painfully so, but through this accord we should be able to secure Norwegian safety much easier. There are those in our nation who think it treason to allow even a single German to stand on Norway's soil, but many more wish for nothing but safety from the Reich, even if we must stand aside them. Though it's not ideal - things in these times rarely are - it is a binding and paradable victory should we assent to it.\n\nStill, it would mean allowing armed Wehrmacht personnel to base - en masse - near our economically vital ports; should relations sour in the future, who knows what use they could be put towards..."

They have agreed in large parts to host our marines and sailors at the dockyards and ports, and have assented to whatever means facilitate this. Though we will be legally limited from introducing other troops outside of a defined radius from the ports, this will allow us to at least maintain operational readiness and strategic integrity in the Scandinavian peninsula.\n\nIt wasn't the resounding victory we sought, but it will at least meet the objectives of the Kriegsmarine as well as allow us to continue further negotiations with Norway. Both us and the Norwegians have shown we are willing to fight for what we need, but neither of us is above meeting the other part of the way in mutual interest.

The German delegation has come with the proposal of a somewhat staggering series of economic and industrial pacts and treaties to 'explore, expand, and exploit' the economic potential in the region to 'mutually improve our nations'.\n\nTheir lofty words preceded several no-less lofty proposals: The introduction of a shared market program with current and future Pakt nation-states, pinning Norway's currency to the Reichsmark off the exchange in Germania, mandating the use of German-made industrial tools and quality standards, integrating continental German dockyards for all naval construction, and much more besides.\n\nThe Norwegian delegation's eyes widened into dinner plates reading the list of 'suggestions' in what can only be described as a Nazi Corporation's wet dream. It became clear to any reader with even a modicum of economic knowledge that this series of proposals would render Norway dependent on the Reich economically, guaranteeing a long-term relationship. If the hypothetical projections are to be believed, however, it would result in large and relatively immediate benefits for the average Norwegian business owner, so long as the nation does not mind tying their future to Germany's.\n\nNow that the cards are on the table, the parties involved lean in to their compatriots in hushed whispers as the negotiations begin in earnest once again."

 bormann.1076.desc:0 "Norway accepts! Aside from minor and marginal details, the Norwegian delegation has accepted the proposal in full.\n\nThis is excellent news for the prospects of the Norwegian economy, but more importantly, it is a true gift to Germany. After the press signalled that the conference was arriving at an understanding on the economic proposals, the Berlin stock exchange underwent a minor upswing. Already, the heads of German industry are sending their representatives across the Baltic and North seas to meet with potential development partners and investors in the region in the hopes of securing vital industries and contracts once the political deal is finalized and enacted.\n\nThough the conference is not over yet, this indicates that a long and prosperous relationship between our peoples lies ahead; it requires only that we follow through and seek it out, together."
 bormann.1076.a:0 "Ambassador! Care to open this bottle with me?"

 bormann.1077.t:0 "Norway Demands Fairer Terms"
 bormann.1077.desc:0 "Unfortunately, it would seem that perhaps the Norwegian delegation is not ready to assent to the terms proposed earlier concerning the integration of our economic interests. Qualms over such issues as 'tenuous demand', 'impossible economics', and even 'fiscal terrorism' were raised in some of the more private meetings at the convention.\n\nEven if they choose not to see the prosperity our offer inherently brings, they have not yet left the negotiating table. They are interested in the potential opening of our markets to one another, but evidently they demand far 'fairer' terms such as not binding their currency to ours or removing the strictest mandates on production and use. The economic advisors we have brought to the delegation warn that by agreeing we ensure the region's growth will decelerate, but we must consider the possibility that it would behoove us to have a substandard policy in place than none at all."
 bormann.1077.a:0 "Press harder and they will accept, they have no other option."
 bormann.1077.b:0 "Our interests are above our wallets, we can make some amendments."

 bormann.1078.desc:0 "Our demands appear to have fallen on deaf ears, or at least they deign not to listen.\n\nRequests for a non-pegged currency have been bogged down, the suggestion of investment into Norwegian dockyards has been shelved, and the appeal to avoid the mandated import and use of German industrial machinery forbidden outright. Any economic threats we levy are feeble without another open market for us to safely engage with, and the Germans know this well. In all areas of the proposals, it seems the Germans refuse to give an inch where we need a mile.\n\nWe have been handed an ultimatum, one that will not be resolved well in either case. We can assent to the original demands in full and practically monetarily sew our nations together at the hip for the foreseeable future, or refuse the demands and be left without any form of economic treaty with the neighboring superpower, and likely the collapse of the conference as well.\n\nThe delegates are leaving the closed meetings now to deliver their reports."

 bormann.1079.t:0 "Germany Presents New Terms"
 bormann.1079.desc:0 "News arriving from the conference today indicates a shift in the stances from the German delegation regarding their latest round of extreme demands. In another back-room meeting discussing the finer details of the hypothetical treaty, the Germans dropped their stand-offish attitudes and instead offered an amended version of the proposals that would waive several of the more draconian measures. Norwegian currency would no longer be penned to the Reichsmark for a start, and other industrial collaboration would actually favor the common Norwegian in several instances as opposed to the few strictly corporate benefits Norway may have received otherwise. Though they are loath to give any ground, the Germans appear to have realized the value a fairer treaty affords everyone.\n\nEven so, there are parts of the economic projects that do not benefit us in the short term at all, as well as the peripheral understanding that acceptance means we will be dependent on them in trade for years to come. At this point though, holding out for a better deal does not seem to be in the cards, and the rest of the conference cannot continue without a definitive solution to Norway's economic situation."
 bormann.1079.a:0 "For the time being it is affordable. Inform the delegation."
 bormann.1079.b:0 "Norway cannot sustain even these measures, it must be refused."

 bormann.1080.desc:0 "The Norwegians are as the glaciers of their homeland - cold and resolute in the face of all our calls of bargain and reason - but even glaciers retreat in time.\n\nAs hours turned into afternoons, the latest negotiations were thought to be in danger of becoming irrevocably mired in details and conflicting demands. Even as leading economic attaches from the Pakt made clear that Scandinavia lacked the capital, workforce, or technical expertise to survive alone as a modern economy, it was almost believed that our translators were sabotaging us, such was the resistance to the economic integration that was proposed. However, with the newly amended proposals, such as allowing their currency to float without being pinned to the Reichsmark, it would seem that the interminably cold reception has finally thawed.\n\nAll their posturing was simply that, a rather bold attempt to take every inch from us they could be allowed before either of us reached the breaking point. Even now the members of the conference are concluding the final alterations to the now-accepted economic deal, and relief is a widely felt emotion in the conference hall. Some may call it greedy of Norwegians - and several of our delegates have said so privately - but so long as this amended deal produces value for the peoples of Norway and Germany it will help ultimately secure the conference, and that itself is worth much more than mere Reichsmarks."

 bormann.1081.desc:0 "All the delegates can feel it. It has been coming for weeks, slowly and steadily building in the halls of the conference, the crescendo of our nations will's and - with a modicum of finesse - its ensuing finale. All other accords have been met, any surviving compromises have been accepted, and the capstone of the meeting may now make itself known.\n\nAfter a cordial declaration of gratitude to the Norwegians for their acts of diplomacy, the day's business was proposed to the filled delegation hall. The first - and only - motion presented by the Germans was thus; a full invitation to the nation of Norway to rejoin the Einheitspakt.\n\nBy reembracing the Pakt, the two nations would be sworn to mutual defense, to commit to embracing common laws domestic and international, and - most prominently - to stand in opposition to the enemies of Nazism around the globe. This proposal was not a shock to any of the men gathered in the conference that day, but its weight was not dismissed or lost on any of them. The results of this German demand would have resounding repercussions. Norway in the pakt would project German power to Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, as well the British Isles; even the Americans in Iceland will also undoubtedly feel the ripples of this action wash upon their shores.\n\nAs the German ambassador solemnly finished his closing remarks, he relinquished the floor and rejoined his delegation to prepare for any... terse negotiations that would follow. The Norwegians mirrored this, rapidly forming a preliminary consensus as they too prepared for the coming days - and weeks - of resolving this demand."
 bormann.1081.a:0 "For the sake of our future, we must accept."

While the revels were underway, the gritty details of their acceptance were being formalized by communications between the Norwegians and their government as well as the party bureaucracy back in Germania. While the success of the garrison and economic deals were foundational, this is truly the crowning achievement of the summit.\n\nWith this victory we can show to the Reich's citizens, the Pakt, and the wider world that Germany's power is neither temporary nor receding - rather it is eternal and growing by the year. While our Norwegian brothers have certainly not been model members of the Reich's community, this could mark a turning point. Moving forward, our peoples will be united in goal and vision; this treaty will do what tanks could not."

 bormann.1083.t:0 "Norway Refuses"
 bormann.1083.desc:0 "It was known going into this week's crucible of negotiations that getting the Norwegians to return to the fold would be a near-Herculean task, and the resistance of the Norwegian delegation did not disappoint. According to their protests, the fundamental reasoning behind their nation accepting to attend a meeting of equals was to secure their future, not ours. They decry that by being forced back into the Einheitspakt, they would be forfeiting theirs and all future generations of Norwegians' "freedom".\n\nThey do not understand; so long as even a single enemy of Nazism stands, none can be truly "free". Yet, maddeningly, whenever we elucidate this point to them they push back harder than before. They have nowhere to run and we've already proven our good faith in our terms so far, so even if they cannot accept that we are fighting for the common interests of our race just yet, perhaps there are methods by which we can meet in the middle. Suggestions of permitting Norway to be granted "Pakt Observer Status" have been made, a measure that will herd them into our fold but still grant them their degrees of leeway in interacting with the wider world, even if they would not be made to observe all Pakt member laws and orders. Still, they have no other harbor in which to turn. The Reich stands astride Europe, Nazism is stronger than ever, and we stand willing to shelter them; by pressing the issue further they will surely realize the futility of resistance to the coming future."
 bormann.1083.a:0 "Our terms have been more than fair, and this is our due. Pressure them."
 bormann.1083.b:0 "The conference cannot fail, offer them Observer Status instead."

 bormann.1084.t:0 "Germany Demands Compliance"
 bormann.1084.desc:0 "Either their translators have been stricken dumb, or the Germans simply cannot choose not to listen to us over their arrogance.\n\nOur refusal to rejoin the Germans' Pakt has not been met with concillations or discussion but louder and more gesticulatory demands for it, and the reality of the situation is beginning to dawn on our delegation. We've come so far into the conference that the safety and security that the treaty would afford us is finally within our grasp, but by presenting this ultimatum all of it could be for nought. If we refuse, nothing protects us from the Germans - who have demonstrated throughout the conference their open lust for our union with them - or otherwise would leave our nation economically abandoned.\n\nPerhaps worse still, if we accept we would be signing away large degrees of our national sovereignty, liberty, and simple dignity. For as far as we can envision into the future our nations would be intertwined, militarily, economically, and politically. In a nuclear age where a single misstep by the arrogant Nazis - or the retribution of their enemies - could spell the end of their entire alliance, it is perhaps more dangerous to join them then spurn them. All attempts at delaying the German delegation from demanding an answer are begging to break down, and if they are not presented with a response they are not likely to continue the conference at all."
 bormann.1084.a:0 "We accept. Let us pray that it is not the wrong choice."

 bormann.1085.t:0 "Germany Offers Pakt Observership"
 bormann.1085.desc:0 "In a turn of events it would seem the Germans, like us, have come too far to see all their gains come up to nothing.\n\nOur recent refusal to rejoin the Einheitspakt in full has been met with a further offer that is certainly intriguing, if nothing else. They have proposed that, failing full reintegration to the pakt, we could be offered 'Observer Status' within it. This would mean that we would have to adopt certain regulations and diplomatic stances endemic to the German's alliance, but we would be allowed to retain large measures of our autonomy and freedom in Scandinavia, Europe, and the wider world to a degree. We would be openly declaring our allegiance to those we struggled against for decades, but we would be afforded mutual-defense and market access, things that we would stridently benefit from.\n\nThis being a notable concession - as well as likely the most sought demand of the Reich - any further negotiation on the subject is not likely to bear any fruit. It would seem, then, that our delegation finds itself at a crossroads; accept membership in the Nazi community and all the risk that entails, or refuse outright and risk suffering the results of a failed conference."
 bormann.1085.a:0 "It is not ideal, but it is livable. Sign the treaty."

 bormann.1086.t:0 "Norway Accepts Pakt Observership"
 bormann.1086.desc:0 "The Norwegian party was rather surprised at the proposal of a limited membership within the Pakt, and believed that because it was our ultimate demand we would not move our stance on the subject. However, with the compromise proposed, the Norwegians saw it as their chance of avoiding a rather unseemly ultimatum on their part, and have taken to the propal with moderate acceptance.\n\nWith this contrition, the Norwegians will officially, as well as militarily and economically, be intertwined with the Reich for the foreseeable future. Though it is a concession to not have Norway re-enter our alliance as a fully-fledged member nation, its Observer Status will meet all our of our immediate strategic goals in the region, as well as lay the foundation for furthering diplomatic progress in the future; perhaps with this coming taste they will see the wisdom in joining in full, one day.\n\nRegardless, this means that all of the capstone accords and goals of the summit have met with success, in one way or another, and has proven the conference's worth many times over by finding a way to please all parties involved."

Praise was liberally lauded upon Norway's people for our exemplary dedication to our shared national values and so on and so forth; it wasn't until the latter half of the brief memo was read that the true nature of the message made itself lucid to our foreign minister. The Germans have extended an offer to our nation to unilaterally rejoin the Einheitspakt, the Reich's hemispheric alliance, as soon as in the coming days and weeks at the earliest.\n\nThis is not something to be taken lightly. While we are more similar to the Nazis of the continent than we are different, we are not certain if we should stand by them at this time. We only just achieved what many in Norway sought for decades, sovereignty, and by rejoining the Pakt we would be ceding much of our newfound lateral powers to Germania's direction. Further, while it would be puissant to join our ideological allies in this dangerous world, there do exist differences in our goals, both material and political. It takes only a cursory glance to see what the extremes of Nazism have wrought upon Europe and the wider world, and if we join them we would be binding ourselves to the very thing we are trying to reform. Regardless, a cold war rages all around us and now by casting off from the Pakt we expose our nation to all the forces that would seek our downfall; Germany, least of all, would certainly not take such a response kindly."

Already, bureaucratic and party forces are making the necessary arrangements so as to smoothly facilitate the expansion of the Pakt, and a personal letter of gratitude from the office of the Führer is being drafted for delivery to the Norwegian heads of government. With this, our control of Northern Europe solidifies, and our ability to project military and diplomatic forces over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the wider continent return to their rightful status. More than one voice dissented as to the prospects of the Norwegians rejoining us in arms; it was feared that with their newfound sovereignty their judgement would be clouded and perhaps reject our hegemony.\n\nWisely, they realized - just as all will eventually realize - that the Reich's might is not temporary, nor fading; it is eternal and growing by the day."

Such an example of this axiom is now playing out nationally between Norway and Germany, as just this hour a response to our offer of readmission to the Einheitspakt was delivered from the Norwegians; they have rejected us.\n\nTheir communique is laced with genteel and conciliatory language - perhaps an attempt to placate us - but it could not conceal their naked desire to ignore our guiding hand in favor of further national sovereignty. It was honestly believed that as a result of the Norwegians rather dire straits they would accept membership in our international community, gladly or otherwise, but perhaps it was naive to assume so. Norway's new government has made clear to all watching that they disapprove of our true brand of National Socialism and seek to develop their own 'national destiny'; this declination is the natural outcome of our guiding absence and is evidence enough of their present and future failings.\n\nFailing to return Norway to our geo-political sphere will have lasting consequences; direct control of the North Sea and our ability to project power over the Scandinavian Peninsula will be undermined. Further still, this example sets a poor precedent moving forward to the integration and loyalty of our administered territories; if we let this stand Norway will be first to spurn us, but they may not be the last."

Erich Koch, the infamous Reichskommissar of Ukraine, has ran the colony in a mostly independent manner ever since the attempt on his life, combined with the collapse of the Reich, severed most ties between Germania and Kiew. The debate over whether he should keep his job has begun to get hot, and it's up to the Fuhrer to make the final decision.\n\nKoch himself notably sided with Göring and his militarists- something that has made him the personal choice of that wing of the Reichstag. However, it also calls his loyalty to Bormann into question. In terms of administrative competence, it seems his record as Reichskommissar is mixed. Removing him would certainly cause a wave of rebukes from the militarists, but keeping him in power- though with a few more checks on what he does- could prove fruitful. After all, Ukraine is one of the few Reichskommissariats to remain loyal during the Burgerkrieg. Certainly, he's doing something right.\n\nOn the other hand, replacing Koch with Theodor Oberländer is a similarly viable option. With a history of loyalty to Bormann and competence in his affairs, Oberländer may make a stellar Reichskommissar for Ukraine. Of course, swapping him with Koch would anger the militarists, but it may be worth it for what could be a more useful ally in the east.\n\nIn the end, it's Bormann's call.

Resistance, famine, and general native discontent all headline the letter, each detailing Koch's failure to solve them and Leibbrandt's plan to fix them. However, Leibbrandt correctly assumes, he can only introduce these reforms if his position as Reichskommissar is officially instated by Bormann.\n\nThis leaves Germania in quite the situation. While Leibbrandt clearly has a plan for Ukraine, his ideas seem to point to him being closer to the reformists in the Burgerkrieg- a group not known for its loyalty to Bormann. However, if what he says is true, his plans may be necessary to preserve the Reich's presence in Ukraine.\n\nAlternatively, replacing Leibbrandt with Theodor Oberländer is a similarly viable option. With a history of loyalty to Bormann and competence in his affairs, Oberländer may make a stellar Reichskommissar for Ukraine. If Leibbrandt is telling the truth and Ukraine truly does need these changes to survive, Oberländer may not be the right fit for the job.\n\nAt the end of the day, it boils down to Bormann to make the decision."

I, Pieter Schelte Heerema, acting Reichskommisar of Ukraine, wish to ask you to renew my mandate as Reichskommisar. I ask you this because I have a grand plan for Ukraine, and I believe that my vision will benefit all the Reich.\n\nMy plan will embark on a vast industrial campaign to turn Ukraine from a backwater of Europe into its factory. Under my guide, the fields will fill with industry, the slaves will toil twice as hard, and the whole Reich shall benefit. If you worry of the potential cost, fear not- I promise that my assets will be used heavily in order to protect the Reich's finances. I trust you will see the potential in this and approve of this plan.\n\nBormann read the letter with interest- after all, an industrial Ukraine certainly held potential for his plans. He looked at the letter in his other hand- a letter dismissing Heerema in exchange for his original choice, Theodor Oberländer. Oberländer was good, certainly- loyal, competent, and intelligent.

His stomach rumbled with an animalistic groan, begging Tauscher for the breakfast he'd had to skip. Why had Stahlecker called this meeting at such short notice?\n\nHe blew on his clammy hands and rubbed them together with vigour. As usual, Heidi had hidden his gloves the evening before. It had become the morning routine for Tauscher to humour his daughter's silly little game and hunt for the gloves, but unsurprisingly she was still tucked into bed, and there was no time to go rummaging. Which genius had decided to organize this meeting for 5am?\n\n"Herr Tauscher?" came a reedy voice, suddenly pulling him out of his thoughts. A stranger stood before him, dark trench coat billowing in the wind. The gentleman's nose was tinged red from the cold wind, and a polite smile was stretched widely across his face. Tauscher was just about to respond when a blinding pain exploded across the back of his head, and darkness enveloped him.\n\nFlashes of light. Shouts of anger. Screams of mercy. Tauscher felt as though he were floating across the floor. He heard a voice he recognised, screaming about a diary. Reinhard Schmidt? A gunshot rang out. There was silence. Tauscher suddenly jolted forwards and landed on the cold hard floor. White-hot agony. He staggered to his feet, the stony walls closing in on him. He turned around to the uniformed man blocking the doorway of the cell and dropped down to his knees in prayer for the first time in decades.\n\nTwo shots rang out, echoing throughout the corridors for all to hear. Orpo officers heard it as they played card games next to the cells. Deputies heard it as they whispered their final thoughts. Ministers heard it as they hastily tied their shoelace nooses, hoping against hope that the torturers would not return. Within twenty-four hours, there was no one left in the building to hear anything.\n\nThe briefing arrived on Bormann's desk. He allowed himself a rare smile of satisfaction and pulled out an Afrikan cigar. Ostland was finally secure."

As the conflict in the Reichskommissariat escalated into furious mayhem, Meyer-Landrut forged his own path, crushing his foes against all the odds.\n\nThis degenerate represents the antithesis of National Socialist doctrine. This man, a manipulative liberal who desires to improve the living conditions of the Slavic scum in Ostland, stands firmly to the left of even Albert Speer and his acolytes. Of all the potential conquerors of the Civil War, it is Meyer-Landrut who provides the greatest ideological threat.

"Needless to say, it was not an easy decision to grant immunity to your government, considering our... ideological differences.

"I understand this situation is a difficult one."\n\n"It's time to look forward," Bormann waved the statement away dismissively. He plucked up a document and studied it intensely. "Your land reforms have proven to be most controversial. They go against the very concept of Germanization itself. As for the issue of 'native rights'... are these reports true? Do you really stand by these reforms?" Ulrich Sahm shifted uncomfortably in his seat.

He whipped his head around just in time to see the black bag over Ulrich Sahm's head shaking side-to-side as two Orpo officers grappled him. Before he could react, Meyer-Landrut's vision was painted black as something tight was thrust over him. Both arms were wrenched back as cold metal was pressed against his wrists. He was thrown forwards into something cramped and humid, his shouts answered only by a heavy slam overhead.\n\nMartin Bormann watched from the window with growing satisfaction as the liberals were handcuffed and carted off.

Under the competent guidance of Hinrich Lohse, Ostland had been loyal to Hitler and the Reich, becoming a model colony for Germanization. With the ascendancy of Jeckeln and his Schutzstaffel cohorts, however, its connections to Germania have been severed, and the National Socialist ideals that made it so strong have been torn out and replaced with the totalitarian nightmare of the Burgundian System. This madman's fanaticism towards the principles of Himmler and his Ordenstaat fiefdom is overshadowed only by his pure hatred for Martin Bormann and the Party.\n\nThe Ostland crisis has become a topic of fiery debate in the upper echelons of German politics. The Reformist wings of the NSDAP and the Wehrmacht alike have capitalized on the political chaos by drawing ominous parallels between the SS thugs to the east and the radical Militarists within Germania. Are Jeckeln's rants about purifying his newly conquered land of its so-called traitors any different from the many speeches of Hermann Göring during the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg? Is Jeckeln's treasonous rhetoric regarding the failure of the eastern Reichskommissariats so dissimilar from the tone of Ferdinand Schörner? Would anyone deny a correlation between the anti-Hitlerist tenets of the Burgundian System and the proposed form of 'true National Socialism' as espoused by the Militarists?\n\nThese arguments are guaranteed to boost the popularity of the Reformists, to the fury of their Militarist foes."

There is no question that Himmler and Jeckeln will stop at nothing to further stretch their black tentacles across Europe's fertile land, despoiling it with their revisionist filth. The Führer's highest military officers have advised him that precautions must be made for violent actions against the Fatherland.\n\nWith a violent rattling of their sabres, the radical militarists within the Party and the Wehrmacht have seized upon this new security threat with their usual fervour. They have openly stoked fears of an Ostland invasion of the Reich and are predicting that the other Reichskommissariats will soon collapse into sinister Burgundian fortresses. Jeckeln was supposedly emboldened by the weak state of the German army, and only by meeting the militarists' demands can we prevent further civil wars and SS plots throughout Europe.

Drechsler and his men milled around the table, eying up the chairs as if they were meals on a restaurant menu, before selecting their seats. The militarist did not even glance towards Bormann, instead keeping his gaze firmly on Walther Hewel. Bormann cleared his throat. "Herr Drechsler, as my Reich Ministry for Foreign Affairs has informed you and your cabinet, I am willing to increase the conscription of the Ostland army."\n\n"Your numbers are not even close to what I requested!" Drechsler had shifted his scowl from the Foreign Secretary to the Führer with the false bravado of a man who had accidentally stumbled into a pack of lions. "Why do you continue to deny me?

One of the several dozens dispatches, however, stands among the others: Bronislav Kaminski accepts the Führer's offer and swears his allegiance to the Reich "in a spirit of cooperation between Russians and Germans, for the glory of the Reich"\n\nBormann can't stop a slight chuckle from escaping his otherwise solemn expression. He finds it highly amusing how collaborators always use such aulic and magniloquent expressions, when in truth they are shamelessly begging for help... Still, he can't deny Kaminski's usefulness: securing a loyal hub in the middle of Moskowien will be extremely useful for the coming struggle, so perhaps a polite answer is in order.

There is, however, a serious threat of bandit attacks, and many terrorist cells linked to the Russian independence groups are still reported as active and dangerous: should they strike at our vulnerable administration, we risk suffering a serious setback!\n\nTo address this issue, the Führer has decreed that Moskowien will be supervised by a provisional military administration until the reconstruction is over. Walther Wenck, a capable officer from the Wehrmacht, will be appointed as military governor, and given all he needs to protect the rebuilding efforts and crush the last remnants of the secessionists."

The time has finally come for the civilian administration to step in: soldiers will leave their place to policemen, quartermasters to engineers, generals to bureaucrats. This would be the best choice for the region: a military government is by definition inefficient, and the population won't tolerate to remain under the boot for much longer, however...\n\nFrom a different point of view, turning the provisional military administration into a permanent structure would grant the Führer a political victory. Ensuring that the militarists are sent to man distant outposts in Moskowien would cripple the militarist faction in Germania, and dramatically reduce their influence over the affairs of the Reich.\n\nA small sacrifice in Moskowien for a boon in Germania, or the contrary? Bormann can't help thinking that both choices have their own value, but one can't hesitate for all eternity: in the end, it's much better that Moskowien..."

Coincidentally, most officers belonging to the unofficial militarist faction of the Heer had been reassigned - or even promoted - to remote garrisons and outposts in Moskowien. Even more coincidentally, their departure was scheduled "immediately". He knew Bormann's true scheme, just as many of the others: remove the militarist faction in Germania by sending all of its members on permanent assignment to Russia.\n\nHe was furious about it, of course, and many agreed with him, but what could he do about it? Nothing. Bormann had them, he had them all. The bastard had put them in a gilded cage, one they had no hope to escape from without revealing their factionalism, and in the Reich, there were no factions, at least outside of those the Führer approved of.

The man had been talking for twenty minutes now about the effects of the oil price crash in the Reich; all information that had been drilled into his head a dozen times now. More generic sameness; the man's name didn't even stand out. Steiner? Boch? He couldn't remember.\n\n"Enough." Bormann folded his hands. "I was called here for a briefing concerning the Middle East, not domestic affairs. I know how market prices work. Tell me about Syria, Iraq, Persia."\n\n"Ah, yes, uh, apologies sir." The man managed to stay composed, and shuffled his massive binder of notes. "What's important to us is that the status quo is breaking down in the Middle East; it has been for months, years. You could say this started with the conflict in Yemen, but sentiment has been boiling in the Middle East for a decade now, perhaps even longer." The speaker looked at Bormann, who gave him a shrug. "Uh, but you knew that. What's important is that the revolutionaries, the Ba'athists, are fighting to overthrow the status quo. That is of course the Italian and Saudi hegemony in the region." Although our economy hurts, we have to look past temporary financial setbacks." Bormann's face turned a shade of red, but before he could speak the man continued. "Now is the time for action! The Ba'athists oppose the Saudis, Italians, and various other regional players. Geopolitically, they are currently isolated. They have however already seen many successes, and would be much deadlier if they had some modern equipment. Without assistance, the Ba'athists will lose; there's too much pressure aligned against them. The situation looks different with our intervention. Starting with small arms and support equipment, we could of course increase our flow of supplies, and consider boots on the ground as the situation develops. What we need to keep in mind is victory for the Ba'aths means defeat for the Saudis, and more importantly, Italy. Italy is dealt a HUGE economic blow, one that would be felt for years. Disrupting Saudi Arabia is an added bonus, since they work closely with Italy to maintain their hegemony. This is the moment we've been waiting for to shatter Italy's influence in the region."

He hated presenting, but the Generaloberst entrusted Wagner to brief these men and give them their instructions for the upcoming mission. The room was filled; the last of the NCOs sat down. "Gentleman..." he began quietly. No one in the room looked up, the NCOs were making conversation and didn't notice. Wagner cleared his throat. "Ahem. Gentlemen!" The whole room went silent. Better. "To the task at hand..."\n\n"You all have heard rumors that we may be deploying overseas soon. The rumors..." Wagner's nerves began to settle. "...are true. You men are the best the officer corps have to offer, and you have been selected for the intervention force in the Middle East. The Generaloberst has been referring to you all as the new "Afrika Korps." The name is still pending." Wagner gave the men a second to process what he said; many of the young faces looked shocked. Some looked proud.\n\n"To hopefully answer some of your questions; you men will be leading boots on the ground, directly supporting the Ba'athist revolutionary movements scattered throughout the Middle East. That means some of you will be sent to Iran, some to Syria, and so forth. Questions?" The room was quiet. "Great." All of Wagner's nervousness was gone; he now strutted in the front with confidence. "Now, it may seem odd to help zealous nobodies in the middle of a crisis at home. Maybe it is, but command sees an opportunity to hurt the Italians and boot their asses out of the Middle East. This means that we'll be fighting Saudi Arabia indirectly, so be prepared. Success means cutting Italy off from its largest cash cow, their oil. You all sitting here, you have been handpicked, literally. You are about to embark upon a Great Crusade. The eyes of the world are upon you.

What began as a shortage of oil and a dramatic spike in prices has evolved into the absolute devolution in investor confidence in the German economy. Even the grand mega corporations such as IG Farben and Siemens brace for impact and rapidly prepare plans to downsize operations.\n\nBy the day, more and more citizens find themselves jobless as even slave labour begins to lose its value.

According to OrPo reports delivered directly to the Führer, tensions have been simmering in universities throughout the Reich, where toxic anti-government propaganda is dripped into the ears of naive and impressionable young Germans by their fellow students and subversive academics alike. As with most student protests, the marching in Hamburg began rather pathetically and looked set to dissipate within the next day.\n\nOver time, however, the ranks of these protesters began to swell as more and more student groups joined them, carrying their cardboard signs and chanting treasonous nonsense. The protests have only grown with time, and older citizens are also beginning to march down the streets in fury.\n\nThe screeching masses writhing through the streets of Hamburg pose no real threat to us. The German people, especially the hot-blooded youth, need to let off some steam every once in a while. Such protests are not entirely unheard of, and while the demonstrations in Hamburg are admittedly larger than most, this is likely due to the current political climate.

They were ready.\n\nHorst gave the signal.\n\nSiegfried stepped in front of the door and delivered a mighty kick, sending it crashing inwards. Horst slid through the open door with his men tightly behind him, scanning the darkened room with the flashlight of his gun. It was empty. Two doors awaited before them. He signalled for his men to split up, and crept in rapid silence towards the left-side door, which was partly open. He pushed through and swept his light across the room with a professional swiftness.\n\nA familiar metallic stench infiltrated his nostrils. Something shone in the light as it passed over the floor. Something wet. Something crimson.\n\nHorst lifted his gun higher, and swore softly. Like a pair of pale islands in a sea of blood, two bodies sat slumped on their small metal chairs without moving. They were both naked. A man and a woman. Each had a hole in the side of their heads."

 bormann.1400.desc:0 "Martin Bormann strode towards the podium with his chest puffed at and grabbed it with two firm hands. Calm washed over him as the crowd stared back in anticipation. He had never been a man of pomp or grandeur. He remembered a conversation with his late wife, explaining how he'd rather be thrown into an unmarked ditch than given a grandiloquent funeral. The brown Party uniforms were pretentious, the gigantism of Germania's buildings grotesque, the various medals and portraits and symbols denoting nothing but pretentiousness.\n\nYet, it was all necessary. Necessary for changing the hearts and minds of the people. Necessary for maintaining the Reich's legacy. How would future generations of Aryans look back upon Bormann's years as Germany's triumphant leader? The thought gave him immense pleasure. Adolf Hitler, the First Comrade, forger of the Third Reich. Martin Bormann, its savior.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen," he boomed into the microphone. "The incompetence of the formerly corrupt Economic Ministry spearheaded by none other than the traitor Albert Speer is responsible for the economic crises caused by slavery. My gradual disintegration of the slavery system shall come to a head today! I hereby declare, as your Führer, that slavery will be abolished! A glorious future awaits the working class.

 bormann.1401.desc:0 "It had been a week since Antonin had been officially declared a "freed slave". What was he now? A citizen of the Reich? A second-class one? Was he anything, really, that wasn't just a number added to labor statistics? He was given his own, shoddy apartment, and his status was changed to 'employee', but to him, his liberation didn't feel like anything special. That morning, he had been looking around for Aleksy, as it had been three days since he disappeared, and, while he initially assumed that Aleksy had some sort of injury and had to recover, Antonin was starting to get concerned. Though many didn't recognize the name - one did. A woman named Zuzanna.\n\n"Can I ask you what happened to Aleksy?" Antonin asked, feeling a worry that he never thought he would have felt again after the Germans shoved him into Litzmannstadt and left the ashes of his past to rot.\n\nZuzanna seemed hesitant to respond, looking away for a moment; Antonin's gaze, however, fierce and unrelenting, forced her to look at him. "He's been relocated. Got freed three days ago and was transported to Poland proper."\n\nSomething about the tone of her voice struck her as off. In it, he could feel traces of a concealed truth. He acted on instinct rather than thought when he continued talking, and he wasn't certain why. "That's not all!" He almost shouted, and Zuzanna flinched. "S-something else happened as well- did he get there? Safely?!"\n\nShe was tempted to run, but something about Antonin possessed a sort of diehard trait to know. "... he... I heard he got sick on the way there-" Antonin's breath became hitched. Zuzanna relented for a moment before continuing. "From what I heard, there was... nothing to treat him with. I'm sorry."\n\nAntonin's head hurt as hard as if he had a migraine. Nodding emptily towards Zuzanna, he looked at his shaking hands. Something about this scenario reminded him of a memory he had never wanted to dig up again. He knew a young man, once, when he himself was younger. Though he wasn't even a man - merely a boy, catching sickness while crammed in a train car full of people like him. Then... then..."

Bormann grabbed her by the waist.\n\n"I'm too busy to get up to anything too shocking today, I'm afraid," he said with a wink, filling her nostrils with the scent of cigar smoke and schnapps. "I'm passing a new law to get us married." Seeing the shock on her face made him laugh. "You and all those actresses I told you about. Did I mention the one I fucked last week? She resisted to start with, but my seductions never fail. You can't say no to the Führer... "\n\n"Marriage..." She was still confused.\n\n"I'm legalizing polygamy as of today. And why not? It's within man's nature to spread his seed and bolster his race, after all. Monogamous marriages are Christian nonsense, a Jewish attempt to prevent the growth of Aryan demographics!" He didn't mention the OrPo reports detailing the public's alleged 'disgust' of such a concept. The reports weren't relevant, or true. Gehlen was just projecting his own insecurities into them.\n\n"Do you really want to marry me," Ingrid replied.

Bormann slumped into his chair and gestured to Gerhard Klopfer.\n\n"My Führer, I have extensively briefed the Reichsministers on your preliminary grand project proposals," Klopfer spoke up. The efficiency of the Party Chancellery under his control had skyrocketed to astonishing heights.\n\n"The expansion of the Entscheidungsnetzwerk is an interesting proposal, for certain," Hermann Josef Abs replied with a cocked eyebrow.\n\n"As, may I add, is the Space Program!" Walther Hewel grinned, without a trace of irony.

He was looking more tired than usual.\n\n"Of course, we are looking at the next decade of–" Bormann coughed into his fist violently. He raised a glass to his lips but hacked again, spurting water over the table. His whole body shook with every rasping cough. Eventually he withdrew his hand in horror.

Everytime he closed his eyes he saw Hewel's naked body covered in blood, and whenever they were open he feared an assassin would lunge out from the shadows of his bedroom. On the rare instances sleep had Bormann in its grasp, a series of agonizing coughs exploding from his lungs would soon tear him into wakefulness.\n\nHow he had suffered for the Reich. Decades of hard work and stress, decades of scheming and manipulation, decades of sacrifice both literal and figurative. Did he not deserve a break? Did he not deserve to indulge in his passions and revel in his power? He had crafted a nation fit to last a Thousand Years. Was a Thousand Years not enough of a legacy for Bormann?\n\nHe chuckled spitefully. Perhaps God really was real.\n\n"It's bad news, I'm afraid." The doctor had turned around. Bormann snapped himself out of his thoughts and listened with grim intensity. "You have terminal lung cancer. At most, I would give you two years left to live. I'm sorry, my Führer."\n\nBormann sat in deathly silence. He pulled out a cigar, lit it up, and took a deep puff. He blew the smoke out of his nose and into the doctor's face.\n\n"I've made up my mind," he said with glazed eyes. "A Thousand Years is not enough.""

Hitler's original plans - called "visionary" and "too bold" in polite terms, have been toned down somewhat - the original plan to more than double the railway gauge across the Reich has been toned down to a one-third increase, though alongside the new railways will be strung a new network of autobahns.\n\nOther Reichministers have been rumoured to be unhappy about the disproportionate funding this particular project is receiving. Führer Bormann however has praised the construction of yet another of his predecessors' projects, calling it "another step towards Hitler's dream for Germany"."

 bor.econ.100.d:0 "Martin Bormann, as ever, was early. He strummed the table impatiently as Reichsminister Lange and his men filed into the room and took their places at the table.\n\n"Hurry up, gentlemen. We have so much to discuss." He spread his arms open. "Reichsminister Lange and I have drawn up a new initiative destined to secure the Reich as the absolute hegemon of Europe. We have called it 'The Modern Wunderwaffe'." The economists looked at each other with impressed faces and nodded eagerly. "We shall initiate various governmental infrastructure and pipeline projects throughout Germania. This city shall become the nexus of the continent in the next decade! Reichsminister Lange, if you please."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Kurt Lange nodded. He was a colourless, bald man in a dull grey suit. A model functionary of the state. "As we all know, the overreliance on slavery has crippled our economy and decimated the working class. Slaves will barely be involved in the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative, mark my words. It is the German worker who shall toil and sweat over these projects, and their newly-earned wages will encourage more spending. Many German firms are financially collapsing and cutting jobs, but the economic boost provided by this new wave of spending should ensure a rise in employment."\n\n"All we need to do is push, and the snowball shall grow into an avalanche," Bormann finished with smug satisfaction."
 bor_econ.100.a:0 "But what is to be done with the slaves?"

 bor_econ.101.t:0 "A Corporate Solution"
 bor.econ.101.d:0 ""Listen up!" Bormann shouted at the chattering economists gathered around the table. They snapped into silent attention. "Here are the final Modern Wunderwaffe proposals formulated by Reichsminister Lange and myself. For this initiative to succeed, we must deal with the slave question. To make way for the working class, the slaves will be deported to small ethnic territories and newly established ghettos throughout eastern Europe. Whether these destinations are in their nation of origin is of no interest to the bureaucratic process. They are all, essentially, untermenschen."\n\n"I have a couple of questions, my Führer," one of the bespectacled functionaries spoke up, awkwardly raising his hand. Bormann nodded at him to continue. "How long can we expect this process to take? And how are the Big Four going to fit into this?"\n\n"It will not be instantaneous," Bormann explained. "The deportation will be at a sensible, gradual pace. The most able slaves will be deported last, of course, so that during the waiting process they can supplement the infrastructure projects with their labor."\n\n"As for the Big Four, if I may," Kurt Lange continued, shuffling his notes. "Presumably you are referring to the mega corporations? Well, we will be attempting to enlist the help of all four, but naturally one will become our primary partner. Siemens is the smallest and most loyal corporation and so will require the least down payment for cooperation. Daimler-Benz is relatively loyal as well, although Reichswerke is less so, and IG Farben's allegiance is by far the most dubious - although it must be said, they are the largest and most powerful, and therefore the most useful."\n\n"Enough, Reichsminister," Bormann interjected. "I have already made my decision.""

The stuffiness would have them sweating like pigs, and he was unsure if the psychology of the grandiose sculptures, paintings and symbols would have much effect on such a powerful man.\n\nErnst von Siemens entered the room with a smile. The Grey Eminence, Bormann thought to himself smugly. The man's demeanour was lifeless and grey. His hair was thinning and grey. His suit, ill-fitting and grey. Yet, embedded in this figure of mediocrity were two sharp eyes, brimming with intelligence. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand we are mostly in agreement? Your corporation will aid the state in these deportations and the establishment of ghettos and camps throughout Europe. You have proven yourself to be a true National Socialist, and so you have my undying trust."\n\n"I am here to fulfil our agreement," von Siemens concurred, "and not to negotiate. The Siemens corporation is not rich enough to engage in the scale you were hinting at during our phone call, but we shall try our best." He leaned forwards, smiling gently. "I will make one thing absolutely certain. I will not budge on this at all. Siemens is the only German mega corporation tolerated in the international community, because we haven't engaged in the same levels of slavery as our competitors. These territories, ghettos, camps - whatever you call them, I want them officially covered up by the state. Agree to this, and the deal is done.""

He was an old man with a dark brown suit too large for his slender frame, and two untrusting eyes that surveyed the room with suspicion. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand your apprehensions. You have benefitted immensely from slavery, and have many friends in high places who support it. Yet here I am proposing that you abet its gradual decline." Flick smiled politely, but said nothing. "As a cunning businessman, Herr Flick, you must understand that the continuation of slavery as it currently operates will drag down all aspects of our economy, including Daimler-Benz? This is an opportunity to not only serve your Reich and the cause of National Socialism, but to make a profit while doing so."\n\n"I want a larger offer of collateral," Flick finally spoke after a minute of intense silence. "I'm sure you will be happy to negotiate. After all, I have a good amount of resources for these camp constructions."\n\nBormann knew that appealing to the man's dual love of ideology and currency would sway him. He could probably be trusted, but nonetheless Bormann would ensure that a great level of oversight would be provided to Daimler-Benz's contribution to the Modern Wunderwaffe."

Were it not for his immaculate dark grey suit, Bormann would have mistaken the square jaw and beady eyes for those of an OrPo officer. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "Your hesitance is understandable. After all, Reichswerke is a huge company, and investing so much into the slave camps and ghettos poses an obvious risk."\n\n"I know it does," Edmund snapped back. "I travelled this way to hear your arguments, not mine. Reichswerke is rich and powerful, and will hugely benefit your plans. But why should I help you?"\n\n"Not as rich and powerful as IG Farben," Bormann responded, restraining his anger at the CEO's impudence. "Yet. Such a high risk project would yield a high reward, high enough to propel you far above your rivals. When people talk of corporate giants, it is Edmund Geilenberg they shall think of - not Hermann Josef Abs."\n\nThe man's beady eyes lit up in interest. Bormann had to proceed with caution. He knew what a risky partner Reichswerke would make, and effective oversight would be difficult to maintain."

He was a portly man with a greying mustache and a black three-piece suit. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began.\n\n"Cigar?" Abs interjected, opening his case. Bormann stared into the businessman's cunning eyes, unfazed, and accepted. The two men puffed deeply on their thick cigars and filled the room with smoke. "I was most intrigued by your offer. IG Farben, naturally, is the largest corporation in Europe. We have the most resources to utilize for your... projects. Unfortunately, slavery has been a large part of our success, if your plans for economic revival fail, then so will my company. I will need many, many subsidies and assurances if you expect me to agree to this deal."\n\n"Then there is much to negotiate," Bormann replied, blowing more smoke into the air. Abs was a ruthless businessman, one whose help would almost guarantee an improved economy. Of course, if the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative proved successful, Abs and IG Farben would only grow more powerful.\n\n"Let us begin. My Führer." His tone was almost mocking."

Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, constantly on the move, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip followed by a pained yell that always accompanied it. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nHe had worked in a car plant before for some company he never got the name of, but apparently the higher-ups decided that he was 'worthy'. Worthy of what - dying before 50 from overworking himself to death? The other men around him were much younger than he was, and the slightest suspicion came to him that he was merely an administrative error. No matter. He had railroad tracks to lay, work to do, a life to keep. Even if it was a hollow and meaningless one.\n\nOne day, Antonin came to work and saw that a young man had come up to him - Aleksy, he was called. A bright man, he was. A shame the Germans didn't look at him that way.\n\n"Mister Antonin!" He shouted, calling the man to attention. "Mister Antonin, have you heard the news?"\n\nHe sighed, tempted to give Aleksy a taste of black humor, but relented. He didn't have to be a depressive man to be around. "What is it, Mister Aleksy?" He asked, half-curious and half-not, but the younger man seemed excited.\n\n"They're tellin' us..." He rubbed the back of his neck. "Well... I've heard, I guess, that some of us might go back to Poland. Live with our own!" The heavy steel that creaked Antonin's back was set down on the floor as Antonin gave him a glare shot with both concern and copious amounts of distrust.

 bor.econ.107.d:0 "There was a reason there was a saying for it. Like rivers, the great streams of Europe's infrastructure controlled the ebb and flow of people and resources into the estuary of Rome. Caesar had seized an Empire with symbols and blood, but Rome kept an empire with roads. When all roads lead to Rome, victory can only travel in one direction. However, even the mightiest of Empires fall, and Rome fell to none other than the Germans themselves. Decadence and degeneracy had gripped the nation, much like it gripped Europe before the Germans wrestled rightful control back over the continent. \n\n One man can't rule an Empire, though if any man could, Bormann knew it was him. Regrettably, he had to share the reins with the petty Führers of the Reichskommissariats. It was these individuals that he needed to build the roads to his new Rome. Goethe had called Rome the 'capital of the world', but that title belonged to Germania now, and it was time the economic flows of the continent reflected it. \n\n Bormann entered the Volkshalle's main meeting room to find the bickering dukes of the Reich's colonies suddenly standing to attention. 'Heil Bormann!' The Führer nodded approvingly, and sat down. The Reichskommissars followed.\n\n The plan was laid out. Infrastructure projects across the Reichskommissariats would be built to ensure the direction of power went to the Reich. Germany must remain the undisputed hegemon of Europe, lest it fall back into the liberal decadence Hitler rescued it from. Railways, oil pipelines, electricity grids. "Think of it like integration," Bormann said. "The Reich and her allies combined to become more powerful collectively than they could ever imagine separately." \n\nBormann added a final touch. "Of course, for their own defensive purposes, the Reichskommissariats would be wise to collaborate with the most powerful military in Europe," the Führer stated. "Germania's enemies fear her for a reason." \n\nFor a second each, Bormann made eye contact with the Reich's Dukes, making sure they understood what he meant. Satisfied with his work, the Führer rose, and exited the room."

More accurately, this involves giving a lot of scientists a lot of money and hoping they come up with something. The best thing is, this strategy usually worked. \n\n Bormann sometimes considered himself a man of science. He had massive respect for the discipline, and the great Aryan minds who had originated its every moment of progress. It was these minds who he had now bestowed a massive investment in; research and development firms across the Reich were now to receive government grants for every new project started. Germany was already indisputably the world's centre of science and thought, but the Führer knew it could be so much more. \n\n Beyond realising the German ideals of science and progress, Bormann understood that these investments would provide a massive boon to the German economy. As a centre of innovation, the Ruhr would now be able to compete with the best of California or Tokyo. This was just securing this reputation however. There was never a doubt of German supremacy, of course."

In an effort to better bind the notoriously independently minded firms to his will, Führer Bormann has declared the introduction of a set of price controls and asserted that whilst raw material may be extracted by private firms, this material is property of the Reich and must be purchased at prices set by the Economic Ministry. Similarly all sales to the government will be made at predetermined prices. \n\n Whilst this would otherwise cause a colossal shortfall in revenue for these titans of industry, the price controls are accompanied by a generous plan of subsidies to make up the shortfall. Notable figures such as Hermann Josef Abs and Friedrich Flick are reported to have voiced their displeasure in private, though they have little recourse other than to bow to the Führer's wishes and continue business as usual, lest they want to find their firms dismantled and themselves behind bars. \n\n The money will continue to flow, but every transaction now takes place one step closer to the government. Bound with paperwork, their leash has been shortened. "

The ring of swiveling chairs faced one another in the centre, upholstered in garish orange, while the wood-panelled walls were festooned with screens and blinking lights. Whilst it was only a mockup, he could see the intention - surrounded by all the information of the Reich, he could pick up a figure with a swing of his legs and a spin - and it was far more organised a system than the mountains of paperwork he was usually inundated in. Even if it did look like he was captain of a spaceship. \n\n "And what exactly do these computers do that a person cannot? I have hundreds of economic planners working tirelessly towards the same goal." \n\n A glint appeared in the scientist's eye, one that Bormann recognised as that of a salesman who has been asked just the right question. He leaned forward in the uncomfortable chair. "That may be what they tell you, but no man can work without rest. If they give you their all you can get at most twelve hours a day at peak efficiency, and that's with toilet breaks, smoking breaks, lunch breaks. Cybersyn does not rest, does not eat, and has no opinion. It cannot deceive, or complain, or strike. It simply sees the figures and finds the pattern. A shortage of coal in the Rhineland will alert mines in the Ruhr, overproduction of ammunition in Prussia will be sent to Ukraine without even a phone call, and strikes in Silesia will be detected automatically and the central government informed." \n\nBormann leaned back. For a scientist, the man sure knew how to sell. If one couldn't trust a machine, what could one trust?"

He had instructed the men to ignore him, and they were doing their best, aside from the one whose chair Bormann occupied. He was doing his best not to glower at his Führer when he thought he wasn't looking. Their chairs revolved back and forth like repelling magnets as they called out percentages and figures - they seemed to not use words like "the" and "and", or indeed any of the words that were required to form a sentence, but nonetheless they seemed to understand one another implicitly. The room was almost identical to the mockup, with the exception of a number of ashtrays to contain the impressive amount of cigarettes the seven planners were going through. \n\n Bormann kicked against the floor, sending his chair into a spin. He could indeed see practically anything he desired - production figures in Hamburg, unemployment in Munich, administrative expenses in Germania. Cybersyn had already performed an impressive cull on useless civil servants and streamlined production pipelines enough to pay for itself, and the engineers had been considering an expansion of its computing power to delegate yet more functions to the ever-expanding network of transistors.\n\n A future where he didn't need economists...

While Cybersyn's designers had done an impressive job with the Reich's finances it seemed they were far less adept at managing their own. With belt-tightening occurring across the Reich, funding had dried up, until Bormann had finally been notified the company had gone under. \n\n At the outbreak of the crisis the Entscheidungsnetzwerk had been undergoing a period of upgrade and maintenance, with only limited operational capability. The additional computers that had been ordered lay piled next to a vast square of empty floor spaces, yet more cables lying in a great unordered mound.

 bor_disII_discovery.1.desc:0 "Generalleutnant Reinhard Gehlen, head of the Militärischer Abschirmdienst branch of the Ordnungspolizei, marched into the Führer's office with grave concern etched onto his blanched face. A thick black briefcase rested by his side. Bormann was about to scold the man for not knocking, but restrained himself. Such a rude act doubtless spoke to the severity of the upcoming topic.\n\n"Heil Bormann," Gehlen panted with a salute before placing the briefcase onto the desk and pulling out a vast assortment of documents, folders and tapes. He finally sat down, took a deep breath, and stared at Bormann straight in the eyes. "My Führer, what I am about to say is a consequence of both research and speculation." He adjusted his square glasses. "I have reason to believe there is an internal conspiracy against your leadership. A conspiracy within the Government itself." Bormann stared back silently, grinding his teeth. Gehlen cleared his throat and ran through the evidence. "I have tape recordings and their transcripts. I have obtained letters and diaries. I will admit that none of this evidence is solid enough to make any arrests, and I am willing to accept that confirmation bias is at play... but I don't think we can take that chance."\n\nBormann sat in silence for a few moments, staring at the documents before him."

"I have reason to believe–"\n\n"That will be all," Bormann snapped. Gehlen cleared his throat and nodded. He gathered up his 'evidence' and made his way towards the door. "One more thing, Herr Gehlen. Never enter my office without knocking."\n\nGehlen nodded silently, saluted, and slipped out the door."

 bor_disII_discovery.3.desc:0 ""You're right," Bormann said through gritted teeth as he scoured the evidence. "We can't take the chance. If there's any dissent in the Government, it must be crushed like a bug. You have my permission to launch a full-scale investigation. Effective immediately.\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Gehlen smiled, his eyes lighting up. "I will use every means at my disposal. It will be completely clandestine, naturally."\n\n"Naturally." Bormann's mind raced with possibilities. Could it be true? Was there a shadowy force lurking within the corridors of the Reichstag and in the offices of the Reichskanzlei? Was dissent spreading throughout his Government, just slightly out of reach? He ground his teeth harder. Who could be involved? Someone in the military? Someone in the cabinet?

He had ordered an investigation into who was sending these letters, which seemed to be being circulated throughout the lower levels of the party. He had been informed, however, that whoever was responsible was skilled at covering their tracks, and arresting everyone found with a copy of the letter would require a purge of the party, an action he was not yet ready to take.

Many Germans have instead resorted to cycling or walking to work - if they have work to return to. The economic slump has resulted in upwards of a million Germans losing their jobs."\n\nBormann turned off his television with a sigh. He was receiving more flak than was fired in the Battle of Britain, and this crisis wasn't even his fault! He should have expected this crash as soon as the Italians established their empire.

 BGR_taking_germania_desc:0 "The situation is getting hopeless. As the frontlines are getting static, and bodies are piling up,generals have started to propose various plans aimed at escalating a border conflict with Speidel. Taking the outskirts of Germania could give us the edge we so dearly need,Speidel will be a tough nut to crack,however."
 BGR_yeet_on_dem_haters:0 "Prepare the assault"
 BGR_border_conflict_warning_GER:0 "Troops mustering at our border"
 BGR_border_conflict_warning_GER_desc:0 "One of the contenders has begun mustering troops at our shared border. Given the dire situation they are in,reports indicate that they are preparing to seize the outskirts by force."
 BGR_border_conflict_escalation_warning_GER:0 "Enemy Preparations"
 BGR_border_conflict_escalation_warning_GER_desc:0 "Recon has confirmed major enemy troops movement near the border. While they still may step down,we must be ready for conflict."

 BGR_escalate_incident_to_border_conflict_GER:0 "Strike!"
 BGR_escalate_incident_to_border_conflict_GER_desc:0 "Our troops are ready and orders are dispatched, in the name of the true Führer, we will win this war!"
 BGR_border_conflict_time_until_cancelled:0 "End the conflict"
 BGR_border_conflict_time_until_cancelled_desc:0 "At the current rate, we can only sustain combat operations for so long before we need to break off combat."
 BGR_border_conflict_escalate_conflict:0 "Escalate the Conflict"
 BGR_border_conflict_escalate_conflict_desc:0 "The conflict at the border has stalled. Perhaps by escalating further and commiting more troops to the theater, we can still achieve a victory."
 BGR_border_conflict_escalate_to_war:0 "The Final Solution"
 BGR_border_conflict_escalate_to_war_desc:0 "Fighting on the border has shown no sign of progress and the high command has ran out of patience. Time to roll up our sleeves and show Speidel what happens to the traitors of the Reich!"
 BGR_border_conflict_back_out_of_conflict:0 "Back down"

 #Foreign diplo
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_category:0 "Reclaiming the Pakt"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_category_desc:0 "With the Bügerkrieg finally fading away, Bormann's view is returning to the Einheitspakt and the Reichskommissariats - or what is left of them. Either way, once the word to begin is given, we will be able to assess and plan our response to what has been going on around us."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Bohemia:0 "Past the Sudeten"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Bohemia_desc:0 "Historically the first major foreign conquest of the Großgermanisches Reich, the region past the Sudeten was reformed into the Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren. Given the region's status as primarily 'Germanized', at least according to pre-Bürgerkrieg documents, its final integration into the Reich will surely be a quick & simple affair."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Netherlands:0 "Our Eyes in the North West"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Netherlands_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Niederlande has been under a state of Germanization under Arthur Seyss-Inquart for the last two decades. With the Reichskommissar's passing, the political situation has changed drastically. We must decide how to deal with our Dutch brethren."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Denmark:0 "The Northern Tip of Jutland"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Denmark_desc:0 "To the north of Germany rests the protectorate of Denmark, sleepy and content. With its generously bestowed - albeit limited - political autonomy, this nation has remained sensible and stable even in times of crisis, never straying away from its obligation of loyalty to the Reich. The Danish are a Germanic people, a fact evident if one were to visit its snowy lands and survey the men and women with their golden hair and azure eyes. The full integration of Denmark into the Reich, though inevitable, is likely years away... but when these efforts are fulfilled, it shall be a joyful day for all Aryan kind."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Crimea:0 "The Lion of Crimea"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Crimea_desc:0 "At the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg Großadmiral Dönitz, a genuine National Socialist and enthusiastic supporter of Führer Bormann, took the Kriegsmarine to Crimea so that it may be safeguarded from the monstrous claws of the Großgermanisches Reich's most loathsome traitors. With the Bürgerkrieg now over, we must give Dönitz a deserving hero's welcome back to the Fatherland."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ostland:0 "The Model Colony"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ostland_desc:0 "Once the 'Model Colony' of the Großgermanisches Reich, the traitors of the Ostfront shattered the Reichskommissariat at the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, with that dreadful conflict over, the Reich must once more assert itself over its rightful Lebensraum. Whomever now governs the region will either dutifully swear allegiance to the Führer or find themselves utterly annihilated, Ostland is rightfully the Reich's!"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Slovakia:0 "The Issue of Slovakia"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Slovakia_desc:0 "Having annexed the territory of Böhmen und Mähren, the Reich turns its monolithic gaze to the territory of Slovakia. Surrounded, with no friendly nations to back them up, and being simple to return back into the fold of the Pakt, we will issue them a concise ultimatum. They will either join, or we will smash open their pitiful army and march straight into Bratislava."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Poland:0 "Tensions in the Weichsel"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Poland_desc:0 "The Generalgouvernement, once thought to be a genuine success with regard to the process of Germanization, fell into chaos soon after the commencement of the Bürgerkrieg... a quite embarrassing example of our incomprehensible bureaucracy. The reformation of Poland poses a considerable threat to the Großgermanisches Reich, we cannot allow for their existence as an independent state to continue..."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Norway:0 "Fjords of the North"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Norway_desc:0 "The Danes & Norwegians (a perfect example of pure Germanic Aryanism) broke free of Germania's control at the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg. Given their strategic importance to the Reich, the Großgermanisches Reich has no choice but to attempt to reclaim these lost territories... this shouldn't be an issue though, the Nordics are pushovers!"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Scandinavia:0 "Into Scandinavia"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Scandinavia_desc:0 "In the north our old and possibly former ally Finland and the eternal neutral Sweden have grown increasingly distant as our influence collapsed in the Civil War. Let's take a look at our old diplomatic relations and maybe more."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ukraine:0 "The Ukranian Problem"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ukraine_desc:0 "Unfortunately the breadbasket of the Reich has not been spared the chaos of the civil war. We need to assess the situation in Reichskommissariat Ukraine and deal with whatever and whoever is in charge there."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Moskowien:0 "The Eastern Bulwark"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Moskowien_desc:0 "Though we had to make many choices and compromises, Moskowien was always our bulwark against the asiatic steppe. Now that bulwark doesn't seem so stable anymore. Action must be taken immediately!"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Kaukasien:0 "The Land of Fog"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Kaukasien_desc:0 "Kaukasien is... odd. Even before the late Hitler's unfortunate demise, little news but lots of oil came from there. Now with Bormann's firm hand, it is time to change this. Let's see what is actually happening in the Caucasus."

Soon after Bormann decreed that the integration of the Danish must continue as before, a notion of ingenuity was raised by his Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs.

 #Civil War
 BOR_der_burgerkrieg:0 "Der Burgerkreig"
 BOR_der_burgerkrieg_desc:0 "It has begun. What many had suspected and dreaded for a long time has happened: The Reich is beset by traitors and usurpers on all sides. But not the madness of Heydrich, the decadence of Speer nor the unrefined methods of Göring are the solution. Only Bormann can truly represent the values of National Socialism that have brought the Reich to its proper place. We shall show that truth to the people, to Europe and to the world. And when Bormanns boot has crushed them the Reich will live for thousand years forevermore."
 BOR_the_faith_of_the_people:0 "The Faith of the People"
 BOR_the_faith_of_the_people_desc:0 "Despite the Propaganda of our enemies, Bormann's support is genuine and wide. For example, this letter from a Munich housewife here or this one from a farmer near Vienna. Letters, gifts and other signs of support arrive daily at the HQ. Let's cite them in every speech, in every newspaper, in every TV spot: the People have faith in us and us only."
 BOR_the_peoples_champion:0 "The People's Champion"
 BOR_the_peoples_champion_desc:0 "All across the Reich those that see Bormann for what he is: Not the pursuer of narrow militarist self-interest like Göring nor corrupted youth like Speer or even the occultist madness of Heydrich. No, Bormann's support lies across all swathes and classes of Germany from the workers to the bosses, from the rural folk to the city dwellers, from the old aristocracy to the dynamic party leaders and from Austria to the North Sea. Truly a man of the people, isn't he?"
 BOR_rally_the_fatherland:0 "Rally the Fatherland"
 BOR_rally_the_fatherland_desc:0 "There's a sound that echoes from east to west. He who can hear hears;\n\nThe sound that no one can rest from, To whom Germany swears allegiance;\n\n110 million, one Führer. Let those who wish deny it.\n\nIn the harmony of hearts, lies the will and the power.\n\n The people are immortal, that achieve unity.\n\n Germany for you the day has come, Germany for you the day has come.\n\n110 million, one Führer.\n\n-Bormannite pamphlet"
 BOR_full_political_mobilization:0 "Full Political Mobilization"
 BOR_full_political_mobilization_desc:0 "With the Civil War starting to gather steam in intensity, a mobilization of the people, the industry and administration is happening. But that is not enough if victory is to be ensured. For Bormann to reclaim his position as Hitler's true successor there has to be a political mobilization as well. From every level of government, to celebrities, propaganda departments, associations and many many more, a full political mobilization will take place. Everyone shall know that Bormann has support far larger and broader than his adversaries."
 BOR_promise_the_calm:0 "Promise the Calm"
 BOR_promise_the_calm_desc:0 "The German people may be a strong, skilled and warlike people; but they are also a people that value Law and Order. With a Civil War going on we are obviously as far away from that as possible. However, the promise to return to the stability needed can be a powerful one indeed, and Bormann shall make that promise in every speech and pamphlet: calm has a name and it is Bormann."
 BOR_fight_for_the_calm:0 "Fight for the Calm"
 BOR_fight_for_the_calm_desc:0 "There can be no doubt that if law and order is ever to return it has to be through Führer Bormann. He is our first and last hope from Speerian degeneracy, SS madness and Goeringite corruption, this has to be made clear to everyone in the Reich. With the parts of the propaganda ministry still under control, posters with Bormann's portrait shall line the streets, radio spots and TV shows will praise him daily and all throughout society. But that is not enough, for the common soldier has to be instilled that he is fighting for the calm that Bormann will bring."
 BOR_fight_for_the_peace:0 "Fight for the Peace"
 BOR_fight_for_the_peace_desc:0 "Though permanent peace makes weak and decadent according to National Socialist thought, peace among those who make up the foundations of the Reich is a necessity. The faster this conflict ends, the faster the Reich can be brought back to a peace that will rebuild the damages already done. This has to be made clear to all units who fight: The harder they fight the earlier they can go home and serve the Reich and Führer Bormann in another way."
 BOR_great_friends_in_high_places:0 "Great Friends in High Places"
 BOR_great_friends_in_high_places_desc:0 "Wittelsbach, Hohenzollern, Welfe and even Habsburg. The old Aristocracy's influence may have faded, but it is still there and so is their old money, their holdings and their titles. Bormann has the means and the influence to draw upon these connections. A few dinners here, some clandestine meetings there. Promises, bribes, threats if necessary and the leaders of old will help ahead the Führer of new."
 BOR_keep_your_friends_close:0 "Keep Your Friends Close..."
 BOR_keep_your_friends_close_desc:0 "The support network that has been built by Bormann over the years is vast. And that is proving itself a handy tool during the days of Civil War. Yet that size also brings with it some problems: Among the number of our supporters are also those found wavering, lazy incompetent or even worse: hidden traitors. Loyalty and trust are good and well, but we shall keep an eye on our various "friends", just in case. And an eye on the watchmen too. The Führer's orders are clear, to take no chances."
 BOR_and_their_friends_closer:0 "...And Their Friends Closer"
 BOR_and_their_friends_closer_desc:0 "One would think that among four warring contenders and the so called guardians of Germania, every person of noticeable influence in the Reich has already picked sides. However this isn't so even among the area controlled by our forces. Bormann of course can't just ignore these potential resources at best and potential traitors at worst. Through his manifold personal connections he will begin to pull some strings and bring these individuals to his side. ...With some precautions of course."
 BOR_the_faith_of_our_leaders:0 "The Faith of our Leaders"
 BOR_the_faith_of_our_leaders_desc:0 "From the old Aristocrats and Junkers with their grand old estates, to the generals and officers of the second Weltkrieg as well as the old fighters from before our rise to power, they all have one thing in common: their Faith in Bormann is strong and this Faith will be the foundation upon which Germany will be made great again. By mobilizing their support whenever necessary, we can get the edge in the civil War we need. We will reward their faith once this is situation is all won and done."
 BOR_friends_in_the_banks:0 "Friends in the Banks"
 BOR_friends_in_the_banks_desc:0 "From Deutsche Bank to Commerzbank and from Dresdner Bank to the Reichsbank itself, Bormann's influence reaches far and wide. Just as aryan entrepreneurs lent a hand to the late Hitler's rise decades ago, so will they help in letting Bormann claim his rightful position. But even beyond voluntary donations, we can use a few tricks to secure loans with favourable conditions. By promising privatizations, lucrative rebuilding deals and tax cuts after the end of the civil war we should get even more help for our cause."
 BOR_we_have_the_money:0 "We Have The Money"
 BOR_we_have_the_money_desc:0 "It seems like all the groundwork Bormann laid before the the civil war, building connections with bankers, functionaries and aristocrats alike is finally paying off. A steady stream of donations and subsidies is securing our war effort, at least for the time being. We should use that advantage while we still can and buy up as much weaponry as we can."
 BOR_the_reichstags_champion:0 "The Reichstag's Champion"
 BOR_the_reichstags_champion_desc:0 "While some may say that the deputies of the Reichstag have scattered all over the various factions of the civil war, the largest plurality supports Bormann. A declaration by these men in favour of the legitimate successor will undoubtedly cement Bormann's reputation as the Reichstag's Champion. And who knows, we might even be able to convince a few wavering or undecided deputies from all over the Reich to join us for our cause."
 BOR_rally_the_bureaucrats:0 "Rally the Bureaucrats"
 BOR_rally_the_bureaucrats_desc:0 "It's not enough that simply the high level managers, administrators and leaders rally to our cause. The secretaries, low-level staff and workers are just as important. War is after all in many ways an administrative problem. By rallying the masses of the Reich's administration to our cause, we gain valuable and experienced body of labour that might just give Führer Bormann the edge he needs to succeed over the traitors."
 BOR_fight_for_your_money:0 "Fight For Your Money"
 BOR_fight_for_your_money_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a Soldier can not fight from faith in the Führer and the Fatherland alone. Mundane things such as food, rest & recovery or even access to fulfill other base desires cost money and even the staunchest Landser gets second thoughts when his pay is miniscule. With our deep financial reserves it is time for a general pay rise for all our forces across the front. With that surely morale will rise and desertion rates will go down. And maybe it will even convince some of the more flimsy supporters among our rivals to switch over to our cause."
 BOR_we_need_the_men:0 "We Need the Men"
 BOR_we_need_the_men_desc:0 "With the civil war still ongoing, our manpower is not what it used to be. Understrength units are starting to struggle to control the frontlines. We need more men, even if we have to compromise on the quality. From those unfit to serve, to deserters and even a few undesirables, those men who have so far fallen through the cracks of our recruitment and shirked their responsibility will be convinced to join our cause for good. Führer Bormann needs every man to do his duty after all."
 BOR_ALL_the_men:0 "ALL the Men"
 BOR_ALL_the_men_desc:0 "We need more men. We need them all and we need them now, but that is only possible by increasing the draft length and lowering the training requirements. Doing that is not going to be popular, but victory cannot be achieved without sacrifice. And with the situation across the Reich rapidly starting to go downhill and the civil war still ongoing, a lot of sacrifice still awaits the German people."
 BOR_we_need_the_cash:0 "We Need the Cash"
 BOR_we_need_the_cash_desc:0 "With no end to this blasted civil war in sight one truth is becoming evident: Most men cannot fight on faith in the Reich alone. Guns, Food and ammunitions require wealth, even now. Bormann's contacts all across Society can get us much of the cash, but to sustain a steady flow we should squeeze and pressure the Banks, confiscate property that belonged to traitorous individuals and loot those possession we come into during the fighting."
 BOR_ALL_the_cash:0 "ALL the Cash"
 BOR_ALL_the_cash_desc:0 "The situation is deteriorating. Now even our formerly so deep pockets are increasingly scraping the barrel to fund the war effort. We have no choice but to go even further beyond in our schemes. That means loans from the banks at cutthroat conditions, requisitioning even from loyalist families and pressing even those of our supporters who can't give much for a Reichsmark or two. And if that isn't enough we will have to start to scavenge and sell raw materials and salvage. Let's hope it is enough."
 BOR_we_need_the_calm:0 "We Need the Calm"
 BOR_we_need_the_calm_desc:0 "Some of our people are getting rather nervous. The civil war is dragging on and on. Will it really end soon? Of course it will! This is Führer Bormann after all. And he will bring law and order back to the german lands. For that he needs calm, discipline and duty. The calm is what keeps us above the anarchy of the students or the madness of the SS. So all of you, keep calm and fight for Bormann, just a while longer. Please."
 BOR_ALL_the_calm:0 "ALL the Calm"
 BOR_ALL_the_calm_desc:0 "The situation across the Reich is, well, not ideal anymore. The length of the civil war is increasingly leaving permanent scars upon both the landscape and the people. Some weak minded fools have even started to whisper, that maybe Bormann isn't the man capable of bringing law and order back to the Reich. They will be proven wrong of course, but with things as they are maybe we need to take some action to make SURE they are convinced."

 BOR_der_wilde_ritt:0 "Der Wilde Ritt"
 BOR_der_wilde_ritt_desc:0 "The Bürgerkrieg has been won, and Führer Martin Bormann has come out victorious. For the moment our enemies have been crushed. However, Bormann's struggle to control the Großgermanisches Reich is far from over, for the Fatherland lies in ruin and if we do not act fast to rectify our poor situation it may embolden our enemies. To prevent any challenge to our rule, we must begin to mold Germany to Bormann's desires."
 BOR_first_things_first:0 "First things First"
 BOR_first_things_first_desc:0 "That being said, before we restore our glory, the Großgermanisches Reich must first reclaim the basics of living from the fires and horrors of the Bürgerkrieg. Now, what are these 'basics' we must reclaim? Well, Führer Bormann supposes that - rather evidently - food for the citizenry and the reconstruction of our once glorious infrastructure are precisely those 'basics'. Therefore, we will ensure that the people are fed and the roads paved!"
 BOR_slaves_to_farmers:0 "Slaves to Farmers"
 BOR_slaves_to_farmers_desc:0 "Regrettably the Führer cannot snap his fingers and cause a nation-wide banquet to materialize - while the Fuhrer wields absolute power over our state, he is no god. There is a serious shortage of food that could result in the commencement of a famine and cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands if we do not act. However, we need not worry, as Führer Bormann has an ingenious plan to solve the impending crisis! We will simply put the slaves to work in Germany's agricultural industry en masse, so that we may produce the food required to feed the nation. "
 BOR_soldiers_to_builders:0 "Soldiers to Builders"
 BOR_soldiers_to_builders_desc:0 "Sadly our Fatherland's once world renowned infrastructure lies in ruin, our cowardly enemies having deliberately destroyed the Großgermanisches Reich through their own greed and lust for power. Of course, one cannot be a Superpower if one's nation is a depressing smoking hole in the ground. Therefore, to restore the Großgermanisches Reich's most crucial infrastructure, soldiers with engineering experience are to be put to work, for they will help reconstruct our shattered Fatherland. "
 BOR_notstandsrecht:0 "Notstandsrecht"
 BOR_notstandsrecht_desc:0 "In 1933, Führer Adolf Hitler passed the Ermächtigungsgesetz under the guise of a state of emergency. In a similar vein to his predecessor, Martin Bormann shall once again institute a Notstandsrecht in order to reaffirm his supreme role over the Großgermanisches Reich as its Führer. Once enacted, Bormann will have the ability to pass laws and dictate Germany's fate without the interference of anybody else. "
 BOR_urban_reconstruction:0 "Urban Reconstruction"
 BOR_urban_reconstruction_desc:0 "The cities of the Großgermanisches Reich have suffered tremendous amounts of destruction and pain as a direct result of heavy house to house fighting during the Bürgerkrieg. Führer Bormann shall not allow for the Reich's population to live in miserable squaller anymore! We must enact a policy of rapid urban reconstruction. The Reich shall bloom with prosperity and happiness once more as we rebuild and revitalize our once beautiful cities."
 BOR_the_elephant_in_the_room:0 "The Elephant in the Room"
 BOR_the_elephant_in_the_room_desc:0 "That being said, there is an elephant in the room, one problem that we have yet to and must tackle immediately if our new Reich is to bloom like the old. The problem being, where do we store all the slaves? Of course, the original Slave Camps have unfortunately been largely destroyed in the flames of the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, we cannot allow these inferior undesirables to walk among us as free men! We must come to a quick decision on the matter or risk the Reich itself. "
 BOR_from_old_make_new:0 "From Old Make New"
 BOR_from_old_make_new_desc:0 "The sheer destructive force of the Bürgerkieg has left ruins littered throughout the Reich, shattered monuments to our violence. A weak man would mourn such loss, and watch silently on as the ghosts of our architectural triumphs haunt the cities forevermore.\n\nThe Führer is not such a man. In an act of genius, he has ordered these ruins to be recycled and utilized in the Great Reconstruction. From the broken, we shall rebuild. From the small, we shall make grand. From the old, we shall make new."
 BOR_academic_investment:0 "Academic Investment"
 BOR_academic_investment_desc:0 "The rise of the Reich dragged German academia from the depravity of liberalism to the glorious truth of National Socialism, and now the horrors of the Bürgerkieg have torn it down once more. Glory can only be sustained by the next generation of academics and scholars, and so we must invest heavily in the Reich's academic institutions."
 BOR_honor_the_war:0 "Honor the War"
 BOR_honor_the_war_desc:0 "Despite the destruction that it brought, the Bürgerkieg must never slip from our collective consciousness. We will pump state finances into the building of monuments and statues dedicated to the Führer's triumph, so that those loyal National Socialist comrades who sacrificed their lives for the German Reich may be immortalized forever in marble and stone."
 BOR_industrial_revitalization:0 "Industrial Revitalization"
 BOR_industrial_revitalization_desc:0 "The Großgermanisches Reich's industry suffered greatly during the Bürgerkrieg, with heavy fighting having damaged or destroyed significant portions of our industry. Rebuilding everything will take a considerable amount of time to accomplish, but to begin with we must at least help one of Germany's three industrial centers - Rheinische, Central, or Süddeutsche industries - which will not only assist in our return to economic normalcy, but is bound to earn the Führer favors he can use later down the line..."
 BOR_rheinische_kohle:0 "Rheinische Kohle"
 BOR_rheinische_kohle_desc:0 "In his wisdom, Führer Bormann has chosen to support the Rhenic industry.

Operation Weserübung, while not the most successful of our campaigns that year, was still an unquestioned success, as the decadent Allies were quickly forced out, and the resources of Norway became ours. Not only that, but the Nordic people of Norway became the first of the Scandinavians to be incorporated into our Reich. Finally, the fjords and harbors of Norway gave the Reich the opportunity to gain naval superiority over the North Sea, a benefit which would become all too useful in the invasion of Britain. With all of these advantages, it was no wonder that the decision was made to remain in Norway when the war ended. Norway has remained one of our most important Reichskommissariats, watching over the north and protecting the Fatherland.\n\nAs of late, however, our grip over Norway has collapsed completely. Terboven, seeing the impossibility of his situation, left Norway with his men to fight in the Burgerkrieg- an honorable decision, but one that destroyed our authority in the region. Such a choice leaves our north open to western imperialism, as even now the Americans circle the waters of the North Sea, looking for an opportunity to expand their hold.\n\nLuckily, the Reich has once again found its footing under Führer Bormann, and we find ourselves with the opportunity to recover the fortress we have lost.

However, when the first ambassadors sailed across the Danish Straits, they landed to something decidedly unexpected- a band, Jonas Lie himself, and swastikas waving in the wind next to their Norwegian counterparts. Things only got better from there.\n\nAs it turned out, when Terboven left Norway, the NS- a collaborationist party that controlled much of Norwegian politics- immediately devolved into multiple cliques of politicians, each fighting for control. After a hard-fought struggle, Lie and his brand of radicals seized power and took the government. Incredibly enough, Lie is more in favor of Germany than the moderates of the NS ever were. We did not even need to ask about a Norwegian re-entry to the Pakt- they suggested it themselves!\n\nOf course, such a positive development is being spread heavily among official papers back home. Already, crowds read fluff stories about the Norwegian's loyalty and belief in the Aryan dream- a loyalty and belief so great that they remained true to the Fatherland, even in our moment of greatest weakness. Such a tale has gone over quite well in the Reich, and it seems that Norway's re-entry to the Pakt is only a matter of paperwork now. Who knew it would be this easy?"

It has become a topic of some discussion in Bormann's inner circle that Lie and his clique deserve, at the very least, a commendation of their bravery and loyalty.

As much as we'd like to prevent this, of course, German assets are limited in these times. We only have a small amount of forces that we can spare to help keep order- not nearly enough to maintain our rule across the Baltic.\n\nOnce again, however, the ingenuity of Lie and his followers comes through as an easy solution. Lie and his government have bent the party's paramilitary- the Hirden- to their will, and they now serve as a loyal force, united behind the radicals. By reinforcing these men with both guns and advisors, we can bolster our presence across the waves without diverting a full division or two.

Traditional holidays were replaced with German ones, celebrations of Germanic culture became commonplace, and the Lebensborn project was thrown into full force. Slowly but surely, the old traditions of Norway were replaced by the true, Germanic celebrations of Aryan supremacy.\n\nUnfortunately, Terboven's departure brought an abrupt end to these changes. Unbelievably, statues were torn down, swastikas ripped to shreds, and the traditions of the wayward Norwegian culture reared its head once more. While this disobedience undoubtedly deserves punishment, it has been decided that we shall simply restore those policies that have been lost. Once again, our loyal men in Oslo have proven to be a lifesaver- while they could not stop the reversal entirely, they certainly managed to contain the damage.

While this may not be our best case scenario, it is certainly not the worst that could have happened- we have worked with Lunde before, and our goals line up in most areas.

To accept such a request, so soon after we saw the near calamity that almost engulfed Norway only months ago, is something we could not accept.\n\nOf course, not many in Norwegen agree with this decision.

However, in the wake of Terboven's exit, the Moderates have pulled a native defense force out of the people, which has been keeping things in check for the last months. After much debate, Bormann has directed that the Norwegians may keep their army, as well as allowing the average Norwegian to arm themselves in defense. After all, the NS clearly has control over the North, and the transfer to natives running the army allows us to consolidate resources that would otherwise need to be stretched all over the countryside. Besides, Norwegians are Nordic people, genetically close to the Aryan race. Why should we be running them as closely as we do with the Slavs and Africans? The solution is clear."

Such a proposal is laughable at best and downright insulting at worst- does he seriously believe that we would allow average citizens to bear arms? How many of these citizens would buy weapons to "defend themselves", only to turn around and sell them to Milorg or other decadent groups?\n\nOn the topic of native defense, it is yet another idea we cannot allow. Borten has proven to be a sometimes unwilling candidate, and he has caused trouble for us numerous times. Can such a man truly be trusted with his own army? It is of the opinion of Germania that a close eye must be kept on him, lest he try to break away from us in full. Were the Norwegians not wary of re-entering the Pakt?

Besides the obvious economic improvements, allowing Norway some extra autonomy is bound to sweeten their opinion of us further, as we slowly shift the perspective of Germany in Norway from that of a conquering empire to that of a Aryan brother and protector, leading all of Europe into a glorious future.

Such policy flies directly in the face of National Socialist doctrine at best and is downright treasonous at worst, but the kicker is the motive we suspect to be behind this action- Borten pretends that this is only for the good of Norway, but it's clear that this motion is meant to distance Norway from us economically, allowing them to slip away while we aren't looking!\n\nIf Borten truly believes that he can slide such treachery past us without us noticing, he'll be proven wrong. We shall twist Borten's attempt to break from us to our own ends, using his own desire to see his reforms through to tie Norway even closer to Germania.

Instead, we shall hold a conference with the Norwegian government. After all, we are more than warmongering brutes- the Aryan is not just a warrior, but a scholar and a statesman as well.

How can they actually convince the Norwegians, already high on the opiate of Western decadency, that partnership with the Germans is better? Worst of all, does Bormann truly even want this to succeed? The Führer is not well known for his love of capitalist nations, and his rather lackluster support of the conference seems to indicate a rather shaky interest in a peaceful solution.

Forces on high alert have been stood down, pilots that had been readied for deployment now suddenly see the fuel take from their planes, and the Kriegsmarine's crews are dismissed from their ships after days of waiting. Most interestingly, numerous special agents have suddenly been recalled, their unknown mission suddenly cancelled. All of this demobilization seems to have deflated the militarists, who were similar to the Führer in their full expectation of a glorious new campaign for the Heer.\n\nThough the success of these talks may have been unexpected, both nations can cheer for a new era of relations between the Aryans of Germany and the Nordic people of Scandinavia, now ready to move forward in an era of unity."

A new era of European cooperation seems to be dawning, and the partnership between Germany and Norway seems to be the first step on the path to a unified, proud Europe.\n\nOf course, the differences between the two are still massive. Norway's western, democratic outlook sharply clashes with the National Socialist doctrine that pervades through the Reich. Their capitalistic, free-market approach to economics drives a similar wedge in between the two nations. Some among the higher echelons of the Reich's political machine question why we ever negotiated with a rebellious subject. Bormann has his reasons, of course. Publically, it's because the Aryan is an inherently diplomatic race- one that can compromise and treat with anyone. Privately, it's because the cost of invasion would be much higher than necessary.

Reasonable discussion turned into shouting, shouting turned to insults, and insults led to the Norwegian delegation leaving the conference with no treaty.\n\nOf course, this was entirely expected in the Reich. Plans drawn up in the case of a negotiation breakdown are already finding themselves activated, as soldiers mobilize across the Reich for what could be the first major naval invasion the Reich has done since Sea Lion.
