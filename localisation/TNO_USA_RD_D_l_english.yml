USA.1701.d:0 ""My fellow Americans, I stand before you today, having taken the oath of office that our forefathers have taken for nearly two centuries. Within many of our lifetimes, we will live to see a third millennium. Before the celebrations of such milestones, it is important to reflect on how our nation is, and how it shall be. I swear to you America: we will be a greater nation upon these celebrations."\n\n"America, for decades, our government has been plagued by inefficiency: wasteful, expensive, and otherwise useless programs that have weighed down the true strength of our nation. For many years, this incompetence was not so important, for the nation was strong and her enemies were few. Now, however, when we are constantly standing upon the precipice of conflict with foreign powers, such programs cannot be afforded. America must stand strong, undivided, and without frivolous distraction, if we are to outlast our enemies."\n\n"Beyond pure survival, though, let us rejoice that, should our almighty God give us strength, I believe we shall rise unto a new age of American prosperity. Taxes and the infernally wasteful IRS shall be streamlined, hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created, and near-every American shall be able to purchase a home and live in peace. You may hear these and believe them to be lofty goals, but I say they are quite achievable. All we need do is trim the fat from our government, and work as one united people.""

First on the agenda is giving the military the resources it needs in order to improve itself. While we can always find more ways to cut inefficiencies and waste, sometimes more money for more training, more recruits, more planes and more boats is necessary. Then, once we have the muscle to flex, we can take an even stronger line against the Germans, who only respond to force. Well by God, we will have force!"

Now we are using the cold, hard facts to maximize everything, especially when it comes to defense. The best place to station aircraft carriers. The most effective use of flybys to intimidate. The best training methods to ensure the minimization of American casualties and the maximization of our enemies. And, if necessary, the loopholes and grey areas of the current laws that we can use to our advantage.\n\nGet a pot of coffee on, it's going to be a long night."

The President has been working with senators from both parties on a sweeping bill to provide billions more to the military, to fund everything from new weapon systems, upgrading technology to become more capable, and investing in bettering the lives of our men in arms. But the largest aspect of the bill is to give the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency the leeway and funds to not only surpass the Germans and Japanese right now, but right into the next century. We will make America not only the strongest nation in the world militarily, but also the most forward thinking and advanced!"

USA_bob_72_appeasetherepublicans_desc:0 "While the Democrats may be on the upswing now that McNamara is in office, that doesn't mean that we can ignore the Republicans and their needs and desires entirely. In fact, that would make running the government that much harder and frictious, and that's the last thing the new President wants. Vice President Bayh has already an idea in mind to work with the GOP: the University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act. Ever since the federal government started giving grants to universities to help develop new technology, the debate over who actually owns the intellectual rights to the new developments has been a fraught one. This new bill will streamline it by giving the universities the chance to patent and profit off these inventions, since they did all the hard work. And the President is all for giving those that work hard on ideas and technologies to improve America's security and standard of living the right to prosper thanks to them."

Quiet and shy, he has a knack for details and can see many sides of the same issue, coming to the best conclusion after long thought. This is exactly the kind of man we need to oversee the Department of Defense. While Rusk's career so far has been in the State Department, President McNamara trusts him to negotiate the rivalries of the different branches of the military to work together to dual goals of defending America, and defending freedom.\n\nThe only opposition we have faced regarding Rusk's confirmation are from uber-pacifist Republicans like Senator McGovern, but they are the very, very small minority. Then again, they wouldn't like anyone to be sitting in the Pentagon unless they were a Hippie."

USA_bob_72_themcnamarapresidency_desc:0 "Robert McNamara is not who anyone would consider a charismatic politician. He's a numbers guy, having studied economics at the University of California, Berkeley and got an M.B.A. at Harvard before the war, and then serving in the Army Air Corps. He wasn't a pilot or front line officer, but conducted statistical analysis of bombers effectiveness, even as the Japanese pushed the Americans across the Pacific. After the war, and a stint in the upper levels of management at the Ford Motor Company, McNamara joined government service, working in the Department of Defense under multiple administrations, doing his best to make the US military the most efficient and effective in the world.\n\nNow, having experience in both the private sector, and turned the military into a finely honed machine ready to stand up to the Reich and the Rising Sun, he's ready to bring that experience to the nation as a whole. With the young and popular Birch Bayh as his Vice President handling the more public events, McNamara can do what he does best: crunch the numbers, find efficiencies, and turn the American government into a finely honed machine."

USA_bob_72_fillingthegovernment_desc:0 "The first call the new President is making is to George Shultz, a successful businessman who had served in several government roles over the previous decades, including on Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors, Secretary of Labor under Nixon, and an economic policy commentator and advisor over the years. This time, Schultz will be given the Treasury Department to run, so he will have some real power to go with his suggestions and plans. He also has strong opinions on foreign policy of the anti-fascist variety, which should make getting any budget increases we propose in the future to run through the bureaucracy that much smoother."

USA_bob_72_timetocleanhouse_desc:0 "One of the problems with the old style of politics was that loyalty to the party and deference to ideology was the most important aspect of governing the nation, even if it didn't actually help America in the long term. President McNamara doesn't believe this: it's inefficient, values subservience to party more than competency in a subject, and leads to infighting and corruption. The best way, the only way, to run the country is to get the best people in the right positions, no matter their political leaning. The Republicans and Democrats may moan and complain as their candidates are shunted aside for non-political, or worse, NPP members, but it's all for the good of America. Nation over Party."

USA_bob_72_rallythedemocrats_desc:0 "The President is not a public speaker. McNamara is a numbers guy, and you can't convince stats with powerful words, nor can you change mathematical facts with soaring rhetoric. His words will never enter the pantheon of great American speeches like Washington, Lincoln or Kennedy. But when he does have something to say, and something that he can't simply hand to Bayh to do, it has to be important. And uniting the Democrats, to ensure they are all on the same page to support his administration, is just one such effort. While the speech he is giving to the Democrats invited to the East Room is full of cliches ("the best is yet to come!") and a couple awkward turns of phrase ("It won't be easy, it will be hard, it may even be difficult"), there is no doubt of the sincerity behind it, and his ideological allies are all the more supportive that he at least made the effort."

Now that the groundwork has been laid, it's time to make official the new McNamara Doctrine. It will not be simply an address to the nation like previous Presidents have done to outline their foreign policy, but it will become ironclad law. We will use our democratic institutions to show to America's enemies what they will soon be facing.\n\nI'd be quivering in my jackboots already!"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids:0 "Call Up The Whiz Kids"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids_desc:0 "In his time serving in the Nixon Administration, Robert McNamara had developed professional relationships, even friendships, with a variety of young, talented and incredibly smart men that soon became known as the "Whiz Kids" within the Federal Government. While they didn't have the top roles in government twelve years ago, working as Under-Secretaries or backroom specialists and analysts, now they are more than qualified to implement modern management systems into the government, focusing on the fields of economic analysis, operations research, game theory, and computing.\n\nAdam Yarmolinsky, William Kaufmann, and Charles Rossotti are just a few of the business executives and intellectuals that will be given high roles in the government, to bring a modern sensibility to the tired mechanics of government. The old timers and civil servants that rely more on patronage and not causing waves may not be too thrilled to be working under these new and radical ideas, but it's the President's decision, not theirs. So they better adapt or get out of the way."

While, yes, the R-D's developed a campaign platform on internal affairs, McNamara is going to leave that quagmire up to Vice President Bayh and Congress to sort out. No, he's focused on the big picture, the whole world.\n\nThe only other people in Washington that cares as much about foreign policy as McNamara does is the National Progressive Party, who are as committed to anti-Fascism as he is. It may be heretical to the President's party, and may require having to agree to slashing welfare, or unsustainably increasing it to get one wing or another onside with his foreign policy, but that's for everyone else to worry about. As long as America is united in defense of democracy and freedom abroad, who cares?"

While they may not agree on much else politically, McNamara is willing to overlook that, to provide bipartisan support to his agenda. The Republicans may not like it, since they aren't going to get one of their guys to be the head of the Pentagon, but it will play well to the rest of the nation. The charts and polls show that."

Schultz marveled at how McNamara could recall the precise details of someone else's work, all these years later.

Even now, as the boss of all America and with his own captive audience, he saw no reason for that to change.\n\n"During the election, I said that America was in to win the Cold War, not to outlast the Germans and the Japanese.

"I want your honest opinion: can this be done?"\n\n"It's not a matter of can - it's a matter of necessity, Mr. President." Rusk didn't bat an eye before responding. "So many Beltway insiders say that nuclear weapons have made major power war obsolete, Mr. President. But in my experience, the road to fighting facism starts well before that point. It will be in the steppes of Manchuria, the South African veldt, the jungles of Indonesia."\n\nRusk leaned forward.

Here was the President of the United States, offering a leader in the opposition a blank check. A nagging voice in Jackson's head whispered that he'd inevitably tie his name to whatever the President had planned - and that if things went wrong, he'd be going down on McNamara's ship.\n\nMaybe that wasn't so bad, if they both believed in the same things. American primacy abroad - and if, in exchange, the President was willing to assure prosperity at home, then wasn't he getting the better end of the deal?\n\nThe next morning, Washington - and R-D party headquarters, in particular - received the news of Henry Jackson's nomination to serve as President McNamara's Secretary of Defense with a single, resounding cry:"

BOB.13.desc.a:0 "After a prolonged debate in the Senate, the [GetYear] Military Readiness Act has passed in a floor vote and is now headed to President McNamara's desk to be signed into law.\n\nThe first major piece of legislation aimed at fulfilling the President's stated goal to revamp the American military for a decisive victory in the Cold War, the bill embraces a sweeping retooling of the armed forces along the principles of modern operational research methods. The Administration's approach to military affairs is suffused with statistical analyses and quantitative methods from the heights of grand strategy to the nuts and bolts of equipment procurement, envisioning an expansive force perfectly tailored for the battlefield of the future.\n\nObjections to the bill on the Senate floor were predominantly focused on the cost of President McNamara's military programs, with a force both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to its enemies being prohibitively expensive to field. Administration officials dismissed these concerns, noting that the American people had elected the President with a mandate to ensure American victory in the Cold War, and that the Administration would employ its same statistical methods to ensure cost-effectiveness in the pursuit of military superiority."

Not only was it the brainchild of an unprecedented bipartisan effort - uniting President McNamara's brain trust of advisors with the most hawkish elements within the National Progressive Party - it's DOM provision (Deployment, Overseas Military) authorizes the 'limited' deployment of American military units overseas, at the President's discretion.\n\nThe bill has had the unusual effect of uniting dovish segments of the NPP with constitutionalists within the R-D's in opposition to the bill, concerned that the FREE Act and the DOM provision would erode Congress' power to declare and oversee foreign conflicts in the pursuit of military adventurism overseas. The McNamara Administration's backers have responded that, nearly a decade after the German Civil War and the Japanese economic crash, America will need to be able to respond quick and decisively to new developments in order to secure its advantage in the Cold War."

Social democrats within the NPP and fiscal hawks within the R-D's waged a successful campaign arguing against waste within the government and questioning the need to spend so much money on overseas military adventures even as the Oil Crisis continues to roil the domestic economy.\n\nAdministration officials put a brave face following the defeat, vowing that the President remained 'determined to secure American interests worldwide with the resources available.' Even so, the defeat of the Administration's first important piece of policy legislation raises troubling concerns over the appeal of the President's agenda to secure American influence abroad over prosperity at home."

The bill's stated rationale to 'clarify and streamline the President's powers to conduct foreign and defense policy' - and its 'Deployment, Overseas Military' (DOM) provision, authorizing limited overseas military deployments at the President's discretion - provoked heated opposition from doves within the NPP and constitutionalists within the R-Ds.\n\nThe floor debate continued for hours, and eventually the opposition's argument that the FREE-DOM Act would gut Congress' constitutional role in declaring and prosecuting armed conflicts gained the upper hand, with the bill's backers failing to mount a spirited defense in the final hours of debate. The Administration - and the bill's backers in the NPP - refused to comment after the vote, and political analysts expect a prolonged period of internal party wrangling within both the R-D's and the NPP."

WFB.2.desc:0 "If one were to think of an ideal candidate for Secretary of State, Edmund Muskie... wouldn't be it.  He's reserved, blunt, and relatively inexperienced in foreign affairs.  But with all that said, Muskie has a lot going for him.  If Treasury Secretary Robertson is a reward to President Bennett's conservative backers, Secretary of State Muskie is an olive branch to the liberal wing of the Republican-Democrats.  As Maine's governor, and, subsequently, senator, he's championed civil rights and environmental protections, bringing Maine fully into the 20th century.  Depending on who you ask, he's either the right man to represent America on the world stage, or a lily-livered provincial who's better off sending pork back to Portland.  As one editor wryly put it: "Sending Muskie against the Germans would be like sending a three-toed sloth out to seize turf from a wolverine."\n\n"

His appointment is surely a sop to President Bennett's supporters in Congress.  But it also has many in the opposition worried.  The Treasury Department has a great deal of power over taxes and audits.  What might it do to those who come out against Bennett's agenda, especially with an arch-conservative in the driver's seat?

In contrast to those who call for the razing of Japan or German Africa, he wants the Pentagon to take a more measured approach.  Fewer first-strike capabilities, and more deterrence.  Fewer rigid doctrines, and more counterinsurgency.  To his supporters in Congress, McNamara is a man who will shake things up, rationalizing the business of war in a new era of conflict.  The question remains, though: will he truly change the Pentagon, or will his efforts get bogged down in the old system?\n\n"

The Democratic wing of the coalition has sided with pro-segregation southern states, citing states' rights as an argument to allow for the preservation of the system. This has led to intense conflict with the Republican wing, which sees the enforcement of civil rights as necessary to securing freedom for all Americans. Still others have taken a middle-of-the-road stance and advocated for compromise wherever possible to prevent the complete separation of both parties.\n\nDepending on the route we take for this issue, there can and will be severe consequences to the unity of the party. Regardless of the outcome, far-right and far-left factions of the National Progressive Party will inevitably use the ordeal as a power play to gain votes from disillusioned politicians.

If this occurs, it is possible that they will be caught in a catch-22; if they change the bill to be more liberal, they will lose conservatives, but if they don't, they'll lose the progressives."

It seems that the President has caught himself in a tight spot, in which he cannot pass the bill without the support of both groups, but will lose the support of one by compromising with the other.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the bill is likely to be re-drafted in a much more progressive fashion than before.

This clause was specifically targeted at southern states who administered 'literacy' tests that were nigh-impossible to pass for African-Americans, voiding their right to vote.\n\nObviously, these state-sponsored tests were in violation of the 15th Amendment, and thus illegal under federal law.

For centuries, many regarded African-Americans as commodities to be used and traded, even igniting a conflict which tore our nation asunder." \n\nIt seemed as if the air had been sucked out from the hall. Was the President about to defend the segregationists, or punch them in the gut? "Regretfully, we continue to witness injustices, with African-Americans suffering social, political, and economic wrongs at every level of society. While my fellow Democrats and I adhere to tradition and conservatism, this is by no means justification, or approval of, the prejudices faced by African-American citizens today.

The effects of this decision will surely be felt for years to come, both in policy and in the makeup of the already-weakened coalition.\n\nSo far, Democrats have taken an entirely conservative stance in the Civil Rights debate, arguing against provisions to outlaw race-based discrimination.

But he'd need funds beyond what he currently had to expand into the next county over, let alone nationwide. \n\nAnd whenever he'd visited the local bank to ask about a loan, he'd always had a rude awakening: there was money, if he was ready to pay the usurious interest. Something about there not being enough money, which sounded ridiculous. How could Uncle Sam not have two nickels to rub together? The loan officer would always shrug apologetically. What could he or Horton do, if there wasn't enough silver in Washington? \n\nAnd so each week, Horton would walk into the bank branch with fading hope, and walk out with dying dreams.

WFB.556.t:0 "The Working Man Fights On!"
WFB.556.desc:0 "Good morning, Senators, I appreciate your diligence in making it out here to work this early. Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss." With the President's words, the Republicans sat down across from the President's desk. "Gentlemen, the anxieties revolving around the Silver Act's upcoming vote could lead to a complete collapse of support. As President, I cannot allow factionalism to tear apart our country at the seams; thus, gentlemen, you have all been chosen to head to Chicago to meet with Harrington in C-NPP territory. If we can't patch up the economy by ourselves, then we'll have to extend our hand out to the inner cities. I know things haven't been the best between the Democrats and the Republicans recently, but let's try to smooth all that over, what do you say, gentlemen?" The Senators nodded and quickly left to meet with Harrington himself.\n\nThe city had been bustling with activity, and after waiting around for traffic, the Senators' driver dropped them off at a bustling office building on the corner of Ninth street. Finally, the men found their seat across from the Missourian politician himself, looking as annoyed as he seemed impatient. "Well come on, we're busy all day trying to fix what Bennett and the Democrats couldn't." he asked. While sorting through papers, "Now, what is it that you all need over here?" "Well, Mr. Harrington, the President is looking to propose a deal with you and all of the C-NPP." one Senator said. For the first time in the conversation, Harrington stopped sifting through papers and turned to look at the man. "You're telling me the leader of the Democrats and our nation itself has decided to strike a deal with us? After all the harassment, he finally wants to take a step down and offer us something? Now, please, let me know what the President could try to offer us after all of what we, and the miners of the United States, have had to bear?" After taking a deep breath, one of the Senators spoke up, "Now, I know things have been rough between you and Bennett, but he's offering a direct promise here. He's worried about passing the Silver Act; so, if you choose to get your branch to favor the bill, President Bennett has offered a clause which would ensure the jobs of silver miners across the United States, along with a firm agreement to allow the R-D's to open up greater communication to the C-NPP." The leader of the C-NPP tapped his fingers across the desk while offering a look of suspicion towards the Republicans. "Tell me, what makes the President so willing to finally work with us?" Harrington said.\n\n"Because to be honest, sir, President Bennett believes that if we don't fix the economy now, no one's going to be able to.""

WFB.557.desc:0 "They said this job was going to be fuckin' easy.\n\nAfter a long night on the Congressional floor, President Bennett assembled us in the Oval Office itself the next morning. Three combat veterans, three Southern Democratic Senators, three figures in the Silver Act vote. "Good morning, gentlemen." He said. "Let's face the light here: the Silver Act's vote is creeping up, but the Congress remains polarized, and I fear the worst; so, I'm sending you three down to the Serpent of the South himself, George C. Wallace to guarantee the extra votes. Understood?"\n\nAnd there we were. The room was silent. The three of us were silent. The Governor of Alabama just sat there, quiet, the whole fucking building was just quiet. "Senators, may I ask what you three are doing down here in my office?" he said, as the pouring of whiskey into five separate glasses flowed in front of us. One Senator picked up first, coughing, "Well, sir, the President sent us here to-" "Oh, my apologies, gentlemen, please, the travel must have dried your throats; please, enjoy a drink." He interrupted. "Don't worry, Mr. Governor, I do not drink." I said, shooting me with eyes like daggers. "Now, as I was saying, sir, President Bennett sent us here to discuss the proceedings of the Silver Act coming up, and how we can align our interests for the betterment of the nation." the Senator said. Wallace swiveled his chair to face the man, stating, "Align our interests? Funny little phrase you put together there. Now, what could the President offer that I may want?" The air in the room tightened like a noose around a criminal's throat. "Well, segregation, sir." the younger Senator with the Southern drawl voiced.\n\nWallace turned."So, Bennett's finally ready to ease down on protecting the Afros? Well, you have my attention, gentlemen. Go on." the Governor asked with a wicked smirk and unending stare. "Well," I finally spoke up, "the President would be glad to have your support, as well as the FR-NPP's support of the terms of the Silver Act. In exchange, he'll look into delaying the work towards Civil Rights legislation." The room stood silent, and still as Wallace's face twisted with contemplation. Suddenly, the room exploded with the slamming of the Governor's fist onto the desk, succeeded by a fierce cackling. "Well, gentlemen, you can go tell Bennett that Governor Wallace shall be considering his proposal to rectify relations with the NPP and the Democrats. For now, however." He stopped short, clearing his throat. "A toast, to the people of the United States." I shakily led our side of the toast and downed the liquor before leaving."

President Bennett has organized a celebratory lunch to praise key members of his Administration, along with some special guests from high society, people of honor, and foreign governments. The mood is high as President Bennett prepares to take to the podium and make a speech.\n\n"My fellow Americans, honored guests, members of my Administration. Today, we stand as one America. One Organization of Free Nations. One world. Over the past few years, we have achieved the greatest accomplishments, soared to the highest heights, and have healed the wounds left from this decade's past. The economy is booming, our people enjoy rights like no other, democracies all across the globe know that their way of life is no longer at stake. The Nazi scourge in Germany, and the Imperialist menace in Japan are beginning to know their place. While their empires of dirt and toil collapse, our nations grow and prosper. We stand united! The torch of freedom burns bright!"\n\nRabid applause erupts from the Rose Garden. The jubilant crowd, fired up from words of passion and wisdom, has hope in their eyes. The future to them does not seem so bleak anymore. Thirty years from now, when their generations ask what they did during the great cold war, everyone in attendance can simply and confidently say that "they won.""

With low interest rates, adjusted oversight, and more provisions, a lucrative section of the finance industry has just exploded. New applicants fresh out of college walk through the office doors seemingly every day. And on the other line of their phones and meeting with people who want to invest, business confidence is being revitalized.\n\nDevin hangs up. He never thought after barely getting his degree, he'd be working in a practically brand new industry. He resigned to a middle management position, but was now making his own money and helping other Americans make it too. To his side, a new arrival sits down, carrying a cardboard box of belongings.\n\n"Hey." The two men exchange an awkward handshake. "You've been here a while, right?" Devin nods. The new arrival stutters a bit, as he moves his chair to face Devin. "Are you sure this whole thing is okay? For something so new, it seems to be doing too well..."\n\nDevin nods, and puts a hand on the new arrival's shoulder. "Look, man. I had the same thoughts when I came in, and some other kind fella did the exact same thing to me. The way I see it, we're helping people make money in ways they could never do before.

They drill our military, they send our boys to die in South Africa, they have massive investment into our economy as investors and trading partners, and our diplomats are forced to play second fiddle to American ones. Michael knows that all too well, being a part of Australia's diplomatic corps. Perhaps, deep down, he was only worried about his 1st son, Gil. If those Yanks send him to die somewhere else, he wouldn't know what to do.\n\nThat is, until the American Ambassador paid a visit to Canberra today. And with him, he brought some very interesting news.\n\n"President Bennett has readjusted his policy dealing with members of the OFN. As of today, we'll be withdrawing some of our own administration and diplomatic staff, and giving more autonomy to the Australian government in terms of who and what they want to proceed with diplomatically."\n\nMichael couldn't believe his ears. After the speech from the ambassador, he turned to the man next to him. "Hey, mate. You really believe what this Yank is saying? They've been up our arse for decades at this point."\n\nThe man nodded. "That Bennett really is doing his best to equalize OFN policy. I may not like the Yanks either, but they're doing their best to finally even the scales. About bloody time, if you ask me."\n\nMichael had a sigh of relief internally. Years of worry, and reform is finally upon us. Even if he still had doubts, the new Administration in Washington was at least trying to not be the hegemon in which the OFN relies on. Much like before, Michael knew with confidence now that his opinion was shared with many Australians."

The larger body of Federal aid, social programs, and stimulus pick-me-ups comprise the spiteful organism that primarily embodies said "welfareism". It stunts the people and businesses by making the government a strident economic competitor in the market which drives competition off the rails rather than the government searching for non-competitive foul play as like its delegated responsibilities from the trustbusting 1910's. It worsens the government by giving it a part it does not know how to play with the competency instilled from the consequences of being a private body who must suffer the results it reaps from both successful and failed operations.

Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age.

That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile.

Most of them won't be seeing re-election next time, Goldwater is sure. But in a ceremony in the Oval Office recorded on camera, the Free Trade Act is signed, and it's official. Though the results will take time to be felt as there has been a grace period of a year for most industries, Goldwater's approval has skyrocketed, and Americans everywhere are proud of their moral stance."

The union today operates as its constituent parts have always had since the age of letter and telegram: A cartel of organizations that have given the country's labor geographical bounds, organizing them into territories for each to rule as they see fit.

This paled, of course, to the worst case scenario: Hoover's boys getting caught where they shouldn't, kicking off yet another political meltdown so soon after the Nixon scandal.\n\nSo in his wisdom, he decided to stick with the arguments he's absolutely certain will make a compelling case.

From the thunderous roars of Niagara Falls' waters to the Grand Canyon's towering ravines, not one inch of America's three thousand-mile length lacks in the divine beauty envied by men and sung by its poets. Its forests, its waters, its hills and fields and mountains -- our nation's natural plenty is and should be an object of pride for those fortunate to call these their own.\n\nYet men still seek to imperil America's pristine majesties with misdeeds to sate their own greed; much of them, in fact, are companies with the gall to call themselves Americans. President Goldwater may be an ardent believer in free enterprise, but above all he is the democratically elected steward of the Lord's most beautiful creation. No burden is too heavy, nor cost too great, against their defense from the corrupting tendrils of mankind's pollution."

The ancient caldera's most famous geyser forcefully ejects jets of superheated water from Earth to Heaven, seeming to all and sundry like a wrathful pillar from the Old Testament. Yet for all its awe-inspiring power, Old Faithful and its adjunct supervolcano is helpless against the clouds of industrial smoke that clog its airs, or against the heaps of scrap metal that defile its lands and waters.\n\nThe President feels it is only fitting to announce his next great effort before such a strong, yet helpless creation -- for is that not what now best describes American nature?"

Aside from interstate commerce and foreign policy, he also believes environmental protection is a burden only the federal government can guaranteeably shoulder. Thus, a hypothetical "Environmental Protection Agency" will better harness the country's will towards the stewardship of its natural bounty than the quiltwork, often underfunded programs of its individual states.\n\nThe President has directed his staff to draft plans for such an agency, keeping in mind the likelihood that Congress and its lobbyists will approve of it. If they won't, then... well, the White House will cross that bridge in good time."

An undemocratic travesty it may be, but such is as part of life in the Beltway as sunshine and traffic jams. Presidents who fail to take the lobbyists' grip into account become lame ducks after their first hundred days.\n\nPresident Goldwater thinks likewise -- but not to appease them.

This trend had suffered somewhat in President Roosevelt's heyday, but not to the point where environmental legislation can pass through Congress without heavy opposition.\n\nNevertheless, President Goldwater has begun consulting his most trusted advisors regarding the EPA bill's shape.

We have much more than that.\n\nLet the damn fool Republicans and National Progressives call him a tree-hugging hippie as much as they like, but President Goldwater will gladly draw money from the budget to protect more square miles, enrol more of America's natural wonders into the registry of National Parks."

It is through laws and decrees that such hands are kept away from such a precious resource, for as recent memory unfortunately shows, men are happy to corrupt clean water into impure water without the visible hand of government to chastize their foolery.\n\nNow more than ever, President Goldwater believes, the federal government needs such laws before America's fresh waters are polluted fully.

These very same books lift Abraham Lincoln up as a paragon of American virtue, at the same time denouncing his heavy handed suppression of American freedoms under the duress of war.\n\nDecades from now, Barry Goldwater will meet their inevitable judgement like the Presidents before him. What Goldwater will their narrative depict? He hoped it would be Goldwater the environmentalist: The ardent champion of the greatest among the American people's shared heritages. But it was equally likely that the Goldwater they paint will resemble a tree-hugging dictator more than a civilized man.\n\nWith a swig, Barry emptied his mug before forcing his attention towards other Presidential matters.

Washington's own kingmaker was straightforward enough: If President Goldwater required the FBI's help in uncovering "compromising information" about America's extremists, then he need only ask.\n\nIn better times, the Director's offer would merit a warning shot for its sheer unconstitutionality.

Clothed in blood-stained red parroting the false German prophet's heresies, socialism has left more scars on Uncle Sam and his children than all the world's fascists put together. Like the hydra of myth, socialism grows despite injuries that would kill lesser men, and it will return to our shores again and again until our cities are crushed beneath its crimson feet.\n\nAll American presidents are duty-bound to cull socialism before it grows into a juggernaut.

Some sympathetic, if unusual, fellows from the opposition congratulated him in private -- apparently "despite (his) traitorous heritage" to quote one of the letters verbatim -- for conclusively dealing with one of their party's unwanted sores.\n\nHe knew better of course. Only fools with the arrogance of Hercules, but with none of his strength, would say that the socialist hydra was slain for good.

However they disagree on the means to achieve peace and prosperity for our people, either side's adherents can take comfort in knowing that the other will eventually be swayed to theirs because of the common goal they share.\n\nFascism, on the other hand, deifies unthinking obedience and lionizes the omnipotence of strongmen. Nowhere else can one find an ideology more anathematic to American values than the Reich's slavish adherence to the supremacy of one race over all mankind. To combat this unnatural foe, and their present sympathizers within the United States, President Goldwater was convinced to set aside its century-old blood feud with socialism for the time being."

Often these solutions involved the brutal acts his Nazi inspirations conduct, chief among them wanton violence and the persecution of America's sheltered oppressed.\n\nJust as mildly put is President Goldwater's antipathy for a man who would shoot him out of a principled hatred for his father's ancestry. An intern questioned if his personal spite for the beloved fascist had driven the order to ruin him with blackmail from CIA infiltrators; to that, the Arizonan simply answered with a knowing smile and a pithy about cutting a snake's head off before it can slither away."

The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep. The covers felt a touch softer than usual that night."

How they hobbled into Congress with dishevelled hair and bloodshot eyes, making like cornered hyenas whenever their fellow critter passed by; how they delivered yesterday's stump speeches with sore throats and a fraction of the energy; how they sat next to one another as if they were bunkmates with Satan himself... the debacle that had played itself out in the days and weeks after was what he'd asked for and more.\n\nAlmost fittingly, Yockey was nowhere to be found. So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance. No friend to the Reich's poisoned honey indeed."

Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice. With the knowledge that his calls had cured American politics of a potent, fatal poison? Barry slept like a newborn babe."

America's repute, as dragged along the mud as his shameful, forceful departure from the White House. America's trust, surely shattered like so many windowpanes in Washington after the riots subsided. America's faith in its noble ideals, forever tarnished by the scandals many had thought are beneath the hallowed office of presidency.\n\n[USA.GetLeader] now takes his place, immediately burdened with the ashes Wallace had left behind in his dogged quest to burn America down. Violence soars to a fever pitch, vigilantes run amok unopposed, green numbers turn red and falter and dip.

In or against its pursuit America had been laid to its lowest point a century ago; not a few days ago, America teetered dangerously close to a deeper nadir, stopped only by quick action.\n\nAmerica has had enough. The people have had enough. Blood shall be spilled no longer. Peace shall be restored, ancient enmities resolved, bonds of brotherhood reforged. One way or another, civil rights must be resolved now, lest brother fight brother once more."

By calming them down with token concessions in civil rights, the President will remove a major source of concern for American conservatives, in turn making them more amenable to cooperation."

Such behavior will eat away at the slivers of unity the government has left; yet if they break away, then the hope of a functioning Congress will soon follow. For the time being, the President will reproach the progressives and their allies in private, and ask them to desist until we get things in better order."

Barbs may now flow freely in Capitol Hill, but no longer do Congressmen spend hours worrying over gridlock instead of running the country.\n\nWhile cooler heads prevail, the President seeks to better bring both houses of Congress into order.

Just as much effort was spent on predicting the fallout of such a move in America's conservative half. Needless to say, its displeasure -- though weakened by Wallace's self-induced damage -- will bellow loudly from atop chimneys, church steeples, and Capitol Hill's marble dome itself.

He sought to advance the rights of states, but in doing so had compelled the federal government to commit many egregious violations against them. His hatred for the Black had instead become the Blacks' greatest asset. By the time his face kissed the White House's lawn, support for civil rights had reached highs unprecedented -- and he has only himself to blame.\n\nNow it is up to the new President to address the reintensified debate over civil rights.

America's setbacks in bettering its civil rights may be the most notable, so capturing the public's imagination and attention with its violence and rhetoric, but just as aggrieved -- yet given far less attention -- is the dismal state of its education system. Underfunded and overburdened, schools all over the country languished for years as they presided over the lowest graduation rates in decades.\n\nThe wounds may have already been dealt, the President says, but it is not too late to stymie the bleeding and restore the quality education Americans had once enjoyed."

In a few years' time, Wallace had single handedly impeded America's economy from improving for years yet.\n\nThis mistake must be rectified not only for the good of the nation, but also for the good of its citizenry. Effective immediately, the President will restore funding for public schools and educational institutions back to their pre-Wallace levels."

Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting. Clearly, separating the equal only furthered existing inequalities -- and the President aims to do away with the concept fully, despite the furor the South will raise."

Regardless, the worst of the damage is being unwound inch by gory inch.\n\nFew elsewhere does this show more than in reverting his "reforms" to American education. Streams of money, once dried but now restored, have slaked the thirst of schools longing for new textbooks and classrooms. Teachers and students return to their desks in droves. Like well-oiled gears sprung into motion, the great machine of academia now turns with more rust lost and old smoothness regained with every gyration.

This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to "improve" states' rights. Put short, a man who wields the federal government like a mallet to force laws into Congress only has states rights as a tangential goal at best. We should best get to work undoing the damage he's dealt to an otherwise noble goal's repute."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_a_rat_in_sheeps_clothing_desc:0 "Never before has "states' rights" been so associated with segregation as it is today. As expected of a simpleton with little in the way of tact, Wallace never once erred from speaking of "restoring the rights of states to choose their destiny" in the same breath as "keeping the equals separate". Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America. It will take time to untangle the mess he had left behind to local laws, but restoring faith in an integral aspect of America's political system is worth any effort."

With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again. That said, the South will surely look favorably upon someone willing to help their dearest cause at its very nadir."

Subsequently, citing the urgency and need to protect the environment from degradation, the president has signed the bill into law through executive order, bypassing both houses of Congress. The administration insists on the legality of the executive order, while citing its necessity in order to ensure America's nature is preserved. Some voices within the republican half of the Republican-Democrats have denounced this move by the administration as authoritarian. Nevertheless, few others have protested at this measure of the administration.\n\nThe bill is a great step forward in environmental legislation. Regardless of his firm belief in laissez-faire, President Barry Goldwater has always had a special appreciation for America's natural beauty, enough that he would see it protected by the federal government. Particularly younger voters seem to agree with and appreciate the president's environmentalist tendencies, making it likely that he is to enjoy a small surge in support among this demographic.\n\nWith the bill, the president's bill has created a new federal agency: the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA will be made responsible for ensuring that all of America's nature will be preserved and not subjected to needless and excessive pollution, through helping develop and enforce environmental regulation in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe president can rest a little easier knowing that America's beauty is preserved for the next generation."

The Oval Office was far more spacious than the one he'd left on Capitol Hill, and was still an unfamiliar space to him. Across from him, Vice President Rockefeller adjusted his glasses and spoke.\n\n"That's what you called me here for, isn't it? To get ahead of any unforeseen issues.

There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Party, while Rockefeller was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the R-D's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Rockefeller to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Rockefeller, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nOf course, Goldwater would never come out to say such a thing publically, even if it was true.\n\n"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. I just wanted to let you know who I'm planning on," Goldwater said, handing over a piece of paper with some scrawled handwriting on it."\n\nRockefeller adjusted his glasses as he sat on the sofa, looking over the names. As he got further and further down the list, his frown got deeper and deeper.\n\n"These are all Democrats," Rockefeller said. "I don't see a single Republican, or, rather, anyone that isn't a conservative, Mr. President. This could divide the party, especially with certain voters." His voters, those that voted for the R-D's because Rockefeller was on the ticket.\n\n"The people voted for a conservative government, Nelson. Besides, you're here. You're at the table. That should be more than enough to make the liberals happy."\n\nRockefeller stood up, handed the piece of paper back. "It's your choice, Mr. President. You should have the people that agree with you around the table." His tone of voice made it clear that he wasn't happy about it. He turned on his heel and left the room.

He rubbed his forehead, staring at the binder with almost two hundred pages of paper.\n\n"You have got to be kidding me," Goldwater said, adjusting his glasses before flipping open the binder, to see an index that listed all of them in alphabetical order. "Thirty years of welfare, and this is the result?"\n\n"Yes, Mr. President," Donald Regan said. The Treasury Secretary stood in front of the desk, shaking his head. "The first thing I did was get my staff to create this, with a brief description of each program the federal government runs, so we can figure out what we can get rid of."\n\nGoldwater flipped the page to the first program, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the AAA, and quickly read the description. "Pay farmers to not plant some of their land, and sell excess livestock to the government?" He frowned, grabbed the page, and with a satisfying rip, tore it from the binder. "That's the first one to go."\n\nThe President stuck his finger part way into the pages, and flipped the binder there. The Works Progress Administration, WPA. "Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure. And hire writers, musicians and painters to create art?" He tore that page out with a particular vengeance. "The last thing the government should be doing is paying anyone to splatter paint on a canvas. If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold."\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. "Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War," Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. "Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month.""I agree, Mr. President," Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. "I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss. Most of the rest can be amalgamated, and then have their combined budgets reduced to an appropriate level."\n\n"I want this binder to be less than half the size," Goldwater said, slamming the binder shut.

 GLD.6.desc:0 ""Socialist Agriculture." That's the phrase that is being thrown around a lot lately amongst Democrats, right wing groups, and those around President Goldwater. The fact that millions of dollars a year are being spent to prop up thousands of farmers in the South when their crops don't yield as much as expected due to the lack of fertilizer and overused soil has become the newest bone of contention with Treasury Secretary Don Regan and his supporters, who seek to let the free markets determine who prospers and who doesn't. Why would anyone be willing to pay farmers to lose money? If they can't cut it, then they should sell their land to more successful farmers and get out!\n\nAlready there are protests by farmers throughout the South at state capitol buildings and federal courthouses, angry at how the government has been treating them over the past decade.\n\n"First all the Civil Rights nonsense, talking about making the blacks our equals. And now they want to destroy our livelihoods? There won't be a single free farmer left in Dixie by the end of the year if this happens. Everyone will be broke, or no better than a slave!"\n\nAlready activists have been going to small towns throughout Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi, telling the farmers about what their Democrat President is trying to do, and how they can fight back by supporting the National Progressive Party, especially the Far Right faction of the NPP. It remains to be seen if it will be enough to topple the stranglehold the Democrats have had on the South since the end of Reconstruction, but some Democrats are clearly afraid for their jobs in the next election."

So catchy names and programs with a word-scramble of acronyms were created. The SSA, the WPA, the AAA, the FRA, NIRA and several dozen more. Slogans like "The New Deal," "the Fair Deal," and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Republicans or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

But the President is also keenly aware that he will need help from the more liberal Republicans within the party in order to pass such a budget, and compromises will have to be reached. In fact, the proposed cuts that are coming out now seem to actually be rather moderate, and more technical than anything. Few programs are being shut down, while others will be merged to realize efficiencies in administration and the bureaucracy, which usually is the largest expense anyway in these kinds of assistance programs. Some funding for grants to states on health, education, food and shelter assistance and more is also being reduced, and more requirements are being put in place to ensure that only those that actually need it are receiving the funds.\n\nIn general, no one is happy with the budget, but few are really angry over it either: Democrats are displeased that the spending isn't even more drastic, while Republicans are disappointed that funding for some benefits that they consider worthwhile and important has been reduced. The NPP is on both extremes: demanding more social spending, or demanding the whole system of Social Security and Medicare and more be totally demolished.

While he didn't get the chance in 1964 to put his plan into motion, now he might get the chance with a conservative like Goldwater in the White House. They had both worked together in the Senate for several years before hand, and Goldwater liked what he heard from Bennett's speeches and proposals for more international trade and re-establishing the Gold Standard. However, Goldwater decided against bringing Bennett onto his cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, instead going for the hardline conservative-libertarian Donald Regan, as he wanted someone he could trust in the Senate to help get his proposals through. Since most of it was Bennett's brainchild, so much the better.\n\nBy pursuing the twin goals of Free Trade and the Gold Standard, Goldwater and Bennett have what they perceive to be a winning strategy: increased prosperity, an end to the economic stagnation of the previous generation, and giving the American people hope for the future. Now, what shape Free Trade would take is still a matter of debate in the halls of power, as Goldwater's anti-fascist views means that increased trade with Germany and Japan would be abhorant to him, while concern over the size, wealth and even political will of the OFN members mean they aren't as great as markets as business leaders would like. And restoring a true gold standard can mean either great things if done right, or a huge economic crash if they fail. It will be a tightrope to walk, but Goldwater and Bennett are sure it can be done."

 GLD.21.desc:0 "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\nBut tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\nWe are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions.

Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear."\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargos with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republican-Democrats, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, "Free Trade" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Democrats, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this "Goldwater Way." Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of "Free Trade." It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Democrat, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external Fascist threat from Europe, Asia and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n"I've gathered you here today to discuss...""

In some countries, smaller businesses are afraid of being undermined or even elbowed out by larger American companies, while labor unions in the US are raising concerns that good paying manufacturing jobs will be sent overseas to areas with lower costs.

In some countries, smaller businesses are afraid of being undermined or even elbowed out by larger American companies, while labor unions in the US are raising concerns that good paying manufacturing jobs will be sent overseas to areas with lower costs. Some are also concerned that there are some nations, especially in Latin America, that are technically democracies and republics, but have some rather un-democratic features including military rule and oppression of minorities and opposition groups. Some countries also have anonymously expressed concern that America will have way too much power, being the largest economy in the OFN, and could be using the smaller nations in a "neo-imperialist" setup. But closer ties within the alliance, and strengthening everyone's militaries in turn, may in turn make the whole stronger.

Despite a last ditch attempt at a Filibuster from an NPP Senator that stretched late into the night, calling the bill a "...disaster in the making for the hardworking American..." Yockey's supporters denounced it as a return to the failed interventionist politics of the past. However, the bill passed with the majority support from the R-Ds and the more moderate members of the NPP, as it was fairly non-controversial in the halls of power. Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports. This will be a victory for everyone: the price of raw materials, oil, consumer goods and more from nations like Canada, Australia and South Africa will be cheaper for US companies and consumers, while giving an economic boost to America's friends and allies."

The opposition, especially the Left and Yockey factions within the NPP, joined together to defeat the bill. This defeat dealt a massive blow to President Goldwater's efforts to slash tariffs on products from OFN allies. The unilateral effort to remove trade barriers was supposed to make trade between America and her allies cheaper and more expedient, which would have benefited all sides, or so Goldwater and the RDs have claimed.\n\nThe L-NPP was opposed from the get go, as they claimed the bill would pulverize the American economy, and more importantly, the American worker. By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their "America First" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck president. Neither is particularly good for the administration, and it remains to be seen if he can fix it."

However, concerns regarding the removal of tariffs, the dismantling of import quotas, the harmonization of regulations and the extension of copyright protections need to be addressed in the NATC negotiations. Labor unions in Canada and the US are afraid that big businesses will seek to lower costs by building factories in the cheaper and less unionized Mexico, while farmers in Canada and Mexico are afraid of being overwhelmed by American food without the import quotas they currently have, or Hollywood and American TV networks destroying her neighbor's cultural institutions. And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade. Mexican's especially believe that the NATC is just a way to get their nation to join the American lead Organization of Free Nations alliance, which would end their decades of neutrality.\n\nAll these problems, and many more, will have to be overcome if the NATC is to be put in place.

Some call it Libertarian, some call it Fiscal Conservatism. Barry Goldwater calls it Common Sense.\n\nEver since the Great Depression, Washington has steadily gained more and more power. At first it was welcomed: some make work programs to get the unemployed workers back to work. Then with the war and the mobilization for it, came inspectors, support for unions, restrictions, rationing of resources, all called temporary, all to win the war.\n\nBut even the war ended in humiliation and defeat, the technocratic, heavy handed bureaucrats and their stalwart allies in Congress doubled down, clinging to their offices and positions, throwing more and more money at every problem. But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt. Business was strangled under the increasing cost and frustration, leaving only those massive corporations with armies of lawyers to survive and stagnate, becoming monopolies. Unions too, for what are they but bloated bureaucracies that only survive to steal money from hard working Americans?

Yellowstone's quiet beauty brought him back to the simpler, happier days of his boyhood, running across Arizona's scorching scrublands with his brother and his sisters. Every American deserved to grow up like that, raised in nature's loving embrace.\n\nThe director let the President know they were ready. Goldwater took his place behind the podium, his back to the expanse of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The President had long been committed to the cause of environmentalism and the preservation of America's natural beauty, and he intended this to be his seminal speech to introduce the public to his love for America's National Parks, and to hopefully sway them to support his program for greater environmental protections and regulations. Goldwater often found it difficult to believe that so many Americans were willing to sacrifice nature's bounty in exchange for the pollution of industry and the soullessness of the urban sprawl. Taking a deep breath to steady his thoughts, he began.\n\n"My fellow Americans. Today I speak to you from Yellowstone National Park, greatest among America's natural monuments. Fifty years ago, this great nation made the commitment to protect and preserve our natural heritage, for these parks belong not to any man but to us all. I would carry on this proud tradition, and revitalise our national parks so that they may be enjoyed by our children and our grandchildren, and all who come after."\n\nAnd so he continued, extolling the virtues of the national parks and laying out his plan to enact a series of programs to preserve the environment and help the national parks grow and prosper.

The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency would be made public the following morning in a press conference, when he would, once again, face the flashing lights and the dark eyes of the cameras he had come to know so well.\n\nKnocking back his coffee, Goldwater allowed a small smile to grow as the scorching liquid warmed the inside of his chest. He reflected on the obstacles he had skirted around or smashed through to bring the EPA into being. The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill.

McNamara's proposal of what compromises and amendments to make to his initial plan for the Environmental Protection Agency lay on the desk, the object of his ire.\n\nMuch to his irritation, the President was forced to admit that McNamara's ideas would certainly be effective at pushing the EPA through Congress and establishing it with minimal blowback. Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line. If he signed, he'd be tarnishing one of his longest-held dreams, giving the polluters carte blanche to continue raping the natural world in exchange for agreeing to follow a handful of token restrictions. When he touched the pen to paper, he felt the familiar fiery indignation building in his chest. Would Michelangelo have knocked off David's head just to satisfy his critics?\n\nThe President faltered, torn. It'd be easy to sign and endorse McNamara's proposal, just a few strokes of the pen and he'd be able to avoid the anger of his voter base, and the party conservatives, and the business community. But, said that other little voice in his head, this is what you've been fighting for. Don't let them take it from you.\n\nDon't let the bastards win."

She knew just how he liked it.\n\nAlready the President was pondering what the public would make of his new bundle of policies aimed at increasing the prosperity of the National Parks program by expanding the size of many parks and drastically increasing their federal funding. He knew plenty of the Republicans and the progressives in the NPP would rail against what they saw as him taking money out of the hands of the poor and giving it to a gang of tree-huggers and mountain-climbers, but he knew, with just the slightest smile, that it wasn't too likely they'd be able to sway the public to their side.\n\nThe fact was that most Americans would be glad or at the very least ambivalent towards the good news that the National Parks would continue to be a major pillar in the preservation of America's environment. Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday!

This is every individual, business and governmental organization we have identified as being potential cohorts in a plan to subvert your environmental policies.

Hailed as a major blow against electoral corruption, the FECA was intended to level the playing field and root fraud from the political process.\n\nNevertheless, there will always be people willing to skirt the law if they think it'll get them what they want. Money makes the world go round, after all, and the marble halls of government are packed with those willing to have a few greenbacks stuffed in their back pocket.\n\nPresident Goldwater had been furious to discover businesses were working with politicians to subvert his environmental legislation, but his anger then was a pale comparison to the Hadean rage that burst from him when he was informed that major businesses had made illegal donations to pro-business, anti-environment politicians in exchange for votes. Lobbying is one thing, outright bribery is quite another.\n\nDriven by that ball of cold fury that burned within him, Goldwater decided to push the big red button and call out the corrupters and their lackeys who were so willing to undermine America's democratic traditions to continue unabated their plunder of the environment. And so, ever the believer in The System, he took them to court. Let's see how smug they are when the judge reads out their misdeeds for the whole nation to hear."

"The National Renaissance Party's being run here, right? Out of your apartment? You really should clean up if you're having company over." Another book of esoterica joined the pile, and Richards pushed over the shelf for good measure.\n\nAn hour of searching later, the raiders departed leaving chaos and broken furniture in their wake.

Ironically, his attempt to escape the law had attracted them to him like a moth to a light.

We no longer poison people from what they eat, or injure them when they are building skyscrapers."\n\n"Don has shown me a lot of research that shows that if we get slackers off the dole, and let companies actually, you know, make stuff, that the whole economy will prosper," Goldwater replied, trying to keep a calm demeanor. "That will be enough to keep the R-Ds together."\n\n"Not if we are sending thousands of people into starvation!" Rockefeller yelled. "Are you willing to let that happen?""If it makes the country better off, then fuck them!" Goldwater bellowed.The argument went back and forth like this for half an hour, a clash of conservatism and liberalism, with tempers flaring and eventually Rockefeller put his foot down.\n\n"Mr. President, you have a choice. If you do what Regan is suggesting, you can kiss the Republican-Democrats goodbye. I know quite a few congresspeople that would rather work with the NPP than you. So, it's your choice to make." Seconds later, the door slammed, leaving Goldwater alone in the Oval Office.\n\n-excerpt from "Barry Goldwater: From Pilot to President" by Doris Kearns Goodwin"

Several Republican-Democrat Congressmen attending the event were seen voicing approval of the Secretary's long-winded heckling of the "McNamara Plan", ostensibly including inappropriate insinuations of the eponymous man's intellect and moral character.\n\nNeither President Goldwater nor Mr. McNamara have issued statements regarding the incident thus far."

Without once mentioning Goldwater's name, Harrington has picked apart, piece by piece, the whole domestic policy of the President, focusing especially on the budget cuts to welfare programs.\n\nWhile Goldwater has been attacked and criticized by many others for these same plans time and time again, they were barely pinpricks to the President.

"And I will assure them that the proposed budget will still make it possible for those that absolutely need the social safety net will receive it."\n\n"Our biggest focus is trying to ensure that federal finances will be sustainable for the long term. This means that some cuts will have to be made, and revenue increased. Welfare and tax reform will go a long way to solving both issues."\n\nThe President spent over half an hour answering questions that the reporters asked regarding costs, who would still qualify, and how the cuts will be implemented over the next few years. While there are many who are disappointed in the cuts, especially in the Republican faction of the R-Ds and members of C-NPP, early reports from pollsters indicate that many swing voters have been convinced by the President's speech.

I'm Walter Cronkite.\n\nWashington, D.C. is in turmoil and shock today with the presentation of President Goldwater's proposed budget to Congress. In a stunning move, many Senators from the President's own party stood up and left the Senate Chamber soon after the debate began on the budget.\n\nThe Republican faction of the R-Ds has been vocally opposed to the President's language and actions in the past few weeks in attempting to cut spending, especially on welfare programs. However, many senators are saying that it was even worse than they thought once they got the chance to read the budget, which led to the Republican Walkout today.\n\n"It is perfectly clear now who the President is supporting," one senator said to reporters as he left the Capitol Building. "And it isn't the average American, or those in dire need of help and assistance. All Goldwater is helping is his libertarian and arch-conservative allies, who want to run roughshod over the poor and struggling."\n\n"This isn't simply balancing the budget," another Senator remarked. "This is an outright declaration of war on the poor, the colored, and disabled. How can we even consider such a proposal without looking at the blood on our hands?"\n\nDemocrats have long supported cutting such spending, seeing it as wasteful, ineffective, leading to a larger government and reducing the liberty, freedom and work ethics of the American worker.\n\nThis may be a huge blow to President Goldwater. The Republican-Democrats, working together since the end of the World War, now seem to be on the verge of collapse, with the right-wing faction of the party gaining ascendance. But it remains to be seen if the budget that the President proposed will actually pass Congress."

However, many Americans are not going to immediately exchange their bills for gold coins, but there is a confidence amongst everyone that if they want to, they can.\n\nWith the confidence of gold backing up the US dollars, and the measures we put in place to keep prices stable and reasonable, we should soon be seeing inflation level off and businesses profits increase. While it may be too early yet to determine the full effects, I'm confident that this accomplishment will bring new prosperity and growth to the United States for years to come."

Those that are not getting the gold or silver are now sure they are being swindled, and banks are on the verge of collapsing. Not only that, but our efforts to set price limits on goods to prevent inflation has also backfired: most of the goods we sought to restrict are now being sold for much more than we decreed, and many stores are being overwhelmed as panicked shoppers try to stock up on everything from canned foods to toilet paper.\n\nNeedless to say, this has been perhaps the worst thing to happen to our economy since the Great Depression. Already many businesses are facing a credit crunch, and layoffs are soon to be widespread. Republican-Democrats in Washington are unable to work together, with liberals blaming conservatives for their misguided actions, and conservatives are accusing liberals of sabotage. The only ones that seem to be enjoying the current situation are the NPP across the aisle. Already, C-NPP leaders and supporters are gloating, saying how they will fix all this.

Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Rockefeller, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nThe bad blood wasn't going to go away, especially not overnight even with the victory in the election.

Officer Alistair MacKinnon was killed instantly, his partner Officer Brock Tarrant taking cover and calling for reinforcements. A tense 7-hour siege ensued with the perpetrators. An FBI negotiator was brought in from Quantico, but the perpetrators refused to respond to any attempts at communication and fired on police when they attempted to recover Officer MacKinnon's body, the dramatic exchange captured on film. On the Governor's order, the FBI was stood down and the perpetrators were engaged by riot police. By 8:45 PM, police had breached the house and killed all four perpetrators, all confirmed to be white males aged 22-38. They also took one unarmed white female into custody. Upon investigation of documents recovered at the scene, the perpetrators have been identified as members of a fringe-right terrorist group comprised of former followers of fascist criminal Francis Yockey. Though it may sound incredible, according to their records, the group, calling themselves Avengers for America, were formulating a plan to assassinate the Hollywood actress and outspoken left-wing activist Jane Fonda for her connection to the Black Panther Party on an upcoming film shoot in Maryland. For now, Mrs. Fonda and the residents of Baltimore can rest easy knowing another threat to their freedom has been defeated.\n\nPresident Goldwater set the newspaper down to look over the photographs.

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer-drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement stand for the NPP's nomination in 1972.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody. Sipping his coffee, the President wondered what to do about the situation. He could put an end to their little commie propaganda campaign, but it might look like a restriction of free speech. Alternatively, he could just ignore it and let them have their poster-boy. No doubt they'd run out of steam soon enough."

Today's speech consisted of his plan to improve the economy, invest in the defenses of the OFN, and handle America's foreign policy. However, as the former Arizona senator dragged on, his words began to target specific parties in the United States.\n\n"I've encountered plenty of 'bad apples' in the political system of our country, but I have never seen a party more destructive to our way of life than the LNPP. You can't find a good politician in the group, they're all bad! And they want to introduce harsh civil rights policies that would change the country all too quickly! These guys preach the nationalization of every business in America, obviously they want to crack down on individuality! They even want to expand welfare far beyond what we're capable of right now! I don't believe a single 'true' American would support their policies!"\n\nOnce the President finished his speech and began the trip back to Washington, he received a phonie call from his Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.

 GLD.union.1.desc:0 "For much of his near-sixty years of life, President Barry Goldwater had maintained one routine without ever skipping a day. At around six in the morning he would wake up, make for the kitchen, and prepare himself a cup of coffee. Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning. He promised every American would have the chance to brew their own coffee. Can't do that without starting the day right, now can he?"

Barry suspected that these deals had become far too commonplace for the Midwest's politicians to garner their concern. The statesmen of Congress are no less vulnerable to pecuniary concerns than the working man, after all -- what was a little quid-pro-quo with the local union for some pocket change?\n\nNaturally, any man of principle would feel incensed at such blatant corruption. The Arizonan himself was reminded too much of New York and old Tammany Hall -- a well-oiled machine of bribes, favors and ballot boxes -- for comfort.\n\nAnd so it was that he said just as much to Don in a private lunch, to which the Secretary of the Treasury replied shruggingly:"

But know this: Corruption undermines both the integrity of the government's laws and its people's trust therein."\n\nHe soothed his parched throat with a gulp of bottled water. "If these... frauds, as Director Hoover describes them," the President continued, "were proven to have used their subordinates' money to enrich themselves and their political allies, rather than to better their workers' lot, then I will not hesitate to wield all the implements the Constitution has bestowed upon my office to see these men answer to the Blind Lady in court."\n\nA nod from the journalist as she sat down.

Companies, friendships, even governments aren't immune to this ugly manifestation of human nature -- Barry needed to glance only once at the muck and grime in Capitol Hill he'd seen since his tenure as Senator to impress that immutable fact into his head.\n\nLabor unions are no different, else why would so many millions flock under their cogs and hammers and sickles? Their playbook is a masterstroke in both its simplicity and its grasp of men's inner machinations: Workers join a union and get all these wonderful benefits, but not before coughing up their cash every now and then and pledging their fealty. Just like that, John Doe gets conned out of both his savings and his free will, tempted by the money to hedge their bets on collective fraud disguised as the highway to a wonderful career. For the rudely awakened... Well, peer pressure and the threat of exile do just fine keeping these comrades in line. Meanwhile, their bosses are free to do whatever they will with countless millions in ill-gotten paychecks. Despicable and abhorrent, but successful all the same.\n\nThis time the roast on Barry's mug was strong and potent, scalding, bitter. It roiled and burbled on his tongue as he read one of several thousand tragedies the White House's mailbox had received since he announced his war on union corruption. After reaching the last dot, he tossed the letter aside and scratched another missive to Director Hoover.\n\nSomething had to be done before these duplicitous "vanguards of workers' rights" swindle another hardworking American.

If they refuse, a shakedown that escalates in a span of weeks until they acquiesce or leave. So-called "scabs" have no place with the boys, after all; more importantly, bosses love to see their numbers grow.\n\nWhat happened afterwards resembled more of a protection racket than a confraternity of workers. Aforementioned benefits were "delayed" due to supposed problems with their employer, all while payments were leaving their owners for their boss's pockets. The unions stifled all attempts to speak out against such cases of unfair treatment, either with community conformity or with brute thugs masquerading as their "comrades" glowering behind every eye corner.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, these men took the federal government's hand, no matter how questionable its presence, if it meant the chance to sterilize these reservoirs of corruption from top to bottom..."

Its title succinctly summarized its contents: Extensive restrictions on the how's and what's of union recruitment practices. Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Democrats bellowed their assent, Republicans muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their "commitment to beloved principle". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill. The Ayes and Nays have been courted, arms twisted, favors owed and hands shaked.

Where American compromise stumbled was in these Senators' party affiliations.\n\nIn this issue his allies are split into two roughly even camps. The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Republicans share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence.

Although arguments were kept from devolving into bloody fistfights, if only just, the entire trial simmered with a consistent level of snide and creative insults exchanged between government and union throughout.\n\nNot that insults were all both sides could offer, of course. The Justices had their fill of evidence and testimony as well: Laws, prior court decisions, compromising materials, even emotional outbursts from several witnesses. Each side did whatever they could to convince the law of the other's guilt, if not their own innocence.\n\nBut there were only so many hours in a day, and everyone involved expected a speedy trial. Weeks later, America's most esteemed judges convened behind the court's closed doors to agree upon the AFL-CIO's fate."

 GLD.union.18.desc:0 "Barry Goldwater was no stranger to loss. He'd lost elections before, lost friends alive and dead, lost everything between a couple dimes and several millions of donor and party dollars. But he thought himself tough, that there's always next times lying in wait just ready to be caught with fresher hands, new opportunities to get what he wants where he wants it.\n\nHis copy of The Washington Times, just a few hours old, had crumples and tear notches with how tight his shaking fists latched onto its margins. In front page, bold text:\n\n"SUPREME COURT RULES 7-2 AGAINST PRES. GOLDWATER"\n\nThere was no getting out of this loss, that much he knew.\n\nWith a wordless cry he threw the crumpled newspaper aside. A hand reached out for a mug of coffee on the Resolute Desk, only to find no purchase. Right, he'd thrown that too, hadn't he? Now it was just fragments of wet, sticky ceramic on the marble floor. Hit the bird splayed at the center of the Oval Office square in the eye too. Cleaning staff can take care of the mess.\n\nSighing, he rose up and hobbled towards the windowpane. Warm and sunny outside, like the good Lord couldn't give a rat's ass about his loss. What did he do to earn His disfavor? Doing the good thing? Something to think about while he spends the rest of his term making like a crippled goose, then.\n\nUnbidden, the old verse from the Book of Psalms left his lips:"

He took a small sample of minutes-old coffee, wincing at the acrid taste as he set the mug onto its plate. Pure black's never easy to get used to, even after drinking nothing but it for days.\n\nBut it was easy to lash out when he heard the news. Lash out at his fellow Americans for not backing him to the hilt. Lash out at the Justices for letting the union bastards get off scot-free. Lash out at God for not sending him a miracle at the end of so much effort. Hatred was strong and raw then, so very tempting to wield.\n\nThankfully, reason quickly reasserted itself. He had his victories, the unions have theirs. He may not have brought the whole thing down, but neither had they gotten away without a nasty limp. He still has half of America on his side, and a good chunk of Congress to boot. His campaign's wounded and bleeding -- but it's not yet out. Never out, if he had his way.\n\nAnd so it was that he addressed his Cabinet later in the day, thanking them for the work they were putting to bring the unions down. They needed reassurance after seeing them "come to naught" against the AFL-CIO. No matter, he said, there's still everyone else. If not America's biggest union, then the bottom feeders nibbling at the scraps it leaves behind.\n\nHoover got a different message shortly after, in yet another of their "personal conversations" behind closed doors."

Sweeter than his standard fare; then again, today was nothing standard either.\n\nGlancing across the table, Barry saw the Director's poison-laced stare bore holes at today's issue of The Washington Times. Its front page had a still of the Supreme Court immediately after the vote, captioned "SC VOTES 5-4 TO CUT AFL-CIO DOWN" underneath. The President felt his grin grow wider.\n\nSure, the union bastards got away in the end. But they also left behind a waterfall of blood as they shambled away to wherever dark crevasse they'd come from. He took another sip from his mug -- slightly bitter, just the right amount of sweet. He can live with a flavor like that.\n\n"What do you mean, Speed?" the President inquired. "We'll do what we've been doing ever since I made the Oval Office my bedroom."\n\n"The Court didn't do enough. Who's to say they won't get back up again?" The Director swigged half his coffee in one gulp, before setting it aside.\n\n"With the penalties coming their way, and the other laws besides?

This time he added twice the sugar and thrice the cream to the mug, before pouring boiling water to mix. Hot mocha seemed appropriate for starting a very promising day -- a little treat every now and then never hurt anybody.\n\nHe had every reason to treat himself, really. If bringing down the fattest socialist hydra in America didn't at least deserve a sugar rush on his part, then why bother celebrating anything at all?\n\nLast night's celebrations still struck vivid images in his mind. Good cheers rang throughout the White House as rich vintages, reserved only for special occasions, flowed the length of its hallways like life-giving rivers. His staff unstuck themselves from that one moment of disbelief upon hearing the decision by hugging and kissing each other as if Christmas Eve and New Years put together had come. He joined in of course. If the kids can have their fun, then so can this old timer with all the stress to burn.\n\nBarry allowed himself a gulp of rich, creamy hot mocha. Of course there'd be fallout; he heard fallout shouting and chanting slogans even from the comfort of his kitchen, sounding like gouts of fire sweeping a crackling inferno across DC. He can start putting fires out after getting prepared for another day in the White House. But for now?\n\nThe President downed the rest of his coffee with one flick of the wrist.

The action was of little surprise for President Goldwater's close council -- his legendary antipathy for "bloated rackets led by the most corrupt of men" was well-known within the Beltway and beyond.

His agents will get away with the dirt without leaving a fingerprint."\n\nSo far, the Director's words ring true. After mere days of planning and observation, a clandestine break-in of an office building evinced the corruption President Goldwater railed against: gifts to fellow union bosses, membership fees "creatively deducted" from annual earnings reports, officers buying twice what they make in a month. The subsequent leak to the media from a "concerned insider" made certain of the union's demise from both public shame and public lawsuits."

None of them bode well for Goldwater.\n\nIt began, according to testimony, when a guard working the night shift in the American Federation of Teachers building at New Jersey Avenue spotted unusual lights coming from one of the fifth floor facade windows. The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office. Drawers gaped open, now emptier without their paper -- but their more valuable effects were left virtually untouched. Cubicle after cubicle of upended folders and undisturbed paper bills. By now the guard was befuddled and confused; just what were the thieves looking for?\n\nAfter switching the lights on, however, he then noticed gold glimmering half-beneath the sea of crisp, white letter paper. Brushing aside the sheafs, he picked it up.\n\nThus, at 1:13 in the early morning, the Metropolitan Police Department woke up to a security guard with an FBI badge held by a shaky vice grip. Thirty minutes later, every news station in the country woke up to an MPD statement that said FBI agents unlawfully entered the AFL compound at midnight. Five hours later, two hundred million Americans woke up to headlines, in bold, flashing print, that said the FBI had burgled a labor union."

"Hollywood's been up in arms since the elections and I haven't had a day of peace and quiet since."\n\nIn one motion he took a swig off the other mug. The actor had his taste and waited for nothing to get it. That alone was worth Barry's respect -- which wasn't hard to acquire for a man of Mr. Reagan's character. The Arizonan had already owed him much more than that when he supported his candidacy last Convention with the finest speech he'd ever heard from a Californian.\n\n"I can imagine." Barry gulped another helping of coffee, before continuing. "Your fellow actors tied their feet to the hawk's?"\n\nReagan smiled knowingly.

Cue a trickle of workers slotting their punch cards by the factory entrance, school children entering the bus in front of their house.

Finally, he responded: "Get me Schmidt. Tell him to stop whatever he's doing and come here at once." At this command, the orderly gave him a quick salute and departed the office immediately.\n\nA furrowed brow was the only indication of the fury building within Speer's heart. After all his valiant effort towards detente with the Americans, this new president was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office.

He supposed it was only a matter of time before they came protesting about the embargo, though he wished it had not come during his brief respite.\n\nHelmut Schmidt was a curious character. Despite his nation's poor diplomatic reputation, the man seemingly oozed a calm sort of confidence. Irrespective of the animosity between their nations, Schmidt was cordial as he spoke at length with McNamara.\n\n"Mr. McNamara, speaking on behalf of Führer Albert Speer and the Greater German Reich, I implore your government to reconsider this course of action. There is much benefit to be had from trade between our two great nations, I'm sure you understand. I am willing to personally travel to negotiate with your president, in the interests of normalizing diplomatic relations once again."\n\nWithin hours of this phone call, McNamara sat in the Oval Office, recounting the discussion to President Goldwater. "The Germans seem willing to parley with us, but the American public expects us to uphold our promises and stop trade with the fascists," McNamara concluded. "I told him I would call him back with your response shortly. What do you want me to say, Mr. President?"\n\nGoldwater thought for a moment. It was certain that America held the upper hand. Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra.

German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n"The Americans aren't taking us seriously." He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. "They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously."\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. "Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them."\n\nThere was silence at the table. "Pardon, my Führer?" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. "We can arrange a meeting. In neutral territory; perhaps Switzerland?

This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country."\n\n"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet."\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called "master race" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."

He had expected this, of course, but it was nonetheless disappointing. And humiliating. "I understand. Thank you for letting me know, Schmidt. You can leave now." Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world. Germany would have to pull itself from the ashes without reliance on America or any other nation, just as it had done once before."

His long shot plan had worked. A moment passed as Speer collected his racing thoughts. Finally he stood, almost too quickly, and motioned for Schmidt to follow him as he marched from the office. "Cancel my appointments for the week," he instructed his secretary as he passed, "and have someone pack my travel essentials."\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt.

Goldwater will almost certainly be playing from a position of strength and, well, I must confess I am no diplomat.\n\nSchmidt struggled to keep up. "I understand, my Führer. I will help wherever I can. If you like, I can help you practice the negotiations."\n\n"I would much appreciate that. I will need all the help I can get." Pausing in the hallway, he turned to Schmidt and took him by the arm.\n\n"This is a historic moment. We must not let it go to waste.""

 GLD.Speer.7.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide"
 GLD.Speer.7.desc:0 "Packing, preparing and flying out to Geneva took less than two days, such was the expediency of the federal branch for such an important occasion. As the plane approached landing, the Secret Service agents aboard began hurriedly running through procedure one more time, and for the first time President Goldwater began to grow nervous. Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet," he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute. Instead, Speer stepped forwards with a slight smile, reached out his hand and greeted him, in English.\n\n"Good afternoon to you, Mr. Goldwater.""
 GLD.Speer.7.a:0 ""Guten Tag, Herr Speer.""

 GLD.Speer.8.t:0 "A Meeting in Geneva"
 GLD.Speer.8.desc:0 "The American President Goldwater had arrived at the hotel shortly before Speer himself. Speer had debated what to do upon meeting him, considering a quick salute and a bow of acknowledgement, but Schmidt had argued that a simple handshake and a greeting in English would be more diplomatic. And so the two had shaken hands, being immortalized in an image likely by now already circling through the world's media. The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. "How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?" asked Speer.\n\n"Pleasant," replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. "I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?"\n\n"Indeed, indeed." As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."

 GLD.Speer.9.desc:0 "After the clicking of the press cameras and the heavy footfalls of their combined security entourage had faded away, Goldwater and Speer now found themselves alone (barring their respective translators) in the designated hotel room, with their security details waiting outside. The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Goering to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world." Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."

I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world."\n\nSpeer waited as his translator relayed his words to the President. He noted two things. The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany."\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."

Goldwater actually had to suppress a laugh. He had caught Speer out on his hypocrisy, and as soon as he got back to America he would regale the press with how the Führer sputtered and stumbled and came up with a thousand excuses for the continuation of his regime. He could already picture the headlines, the documentaries, the inevitable historical significance of -\n\nSpeer laughed. Not a laugh of nervousness or fear, but of amusement. Speer began speaking, his brow cocked slightly as he spoke, and Goldwater found himself suddenly on edge as he awaited the translation.\n\n"You are clearly committed to your ideals of democracy, Mr. Goldwater. Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please."\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree? Attempting to keep his cool, Goldwater began to consider conceding Speer's point. Or perhaps, to prevent further unfortunate lines of questioning, he should end the session here."

What I would instead propose is that you leave your allied nations out of it. The rest of your Organisation of Free Nations should be permitted to trade with Germany if they so wish."\n\nAs Speer's translator finished relaying his words, Goldwater immediately scowled. "Is this why you brought me here today? So that you could propose sidestepping my authority and slipping into the western markets through the backdoor?" He leaned forwards before Speer had a chance to speak up. "Listen to me, Mr. Speer. I vowed to my people that I would shut fascism out of the Organisation of Free Nations. I must emphasise - Free nations, Mr. Speer. As long as your people continue to goosestep their way into the darkness, I will uphold that vow."\n\nSpeer stuttered as he tried to respond. "I have done much to bring Germany into modernity! Even a man like you must see that-"\n\nGoldwater stood, a dark look taking his face. "A man like me? And what do you mean by that? Do you insult me as an American? Or perhaps you refer to the fact that my father was a Jew? Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Speer?" As the Führer stumbled for words, the President scoffed. "I can't believe I agreed to come here. You are no different to your beloved Hitler. Good day, Mr. Speer." With nary another word, he turned and stormed bitterly from the room."
 GLD.Speer.12.a:0 "What nonsense. We're done here."


 GLD.Speer.13.t:0 "The Unlikeliest Deal"
 GLD.Speer.13.desc:0 "Goldwater had expected to come to Geneva to show Speer who was boss. Instead, they were now making a deal.\n\nSpeer, somehow, had convinced him. While the specifics of the agreement would still need to be formally ratified, the embargo would soon be significantly loosened and trade would flow once again between the OFN and the Unity-Pakt. Goldwater wondered how exactly congress and the voters would respond to this development, and even as they began to depart he wondered if it was too late to back out. \n\nAs the President and the Führer stood in the hotel foyer, Speer turned to Goldwater and offered a handshake for the second and final time. "This was a productive meeting, Mr. Goldwater. I look forward to future dialogue with the United States".\n\nGoldwater paused as he returned the handshake. Shaking hands with a man whose country would consider someone of Jewish blood like himself as less than human still felt troubling. "This was more... diplomatic than I was expecting. Thank you for your time". With that, the two men departed the hotel for their respective return trips.\n\nGoldwater had a lot of time to think as his flight made its journey back to America. What would he say to the press? How would the party respond to his unexpected u-turn? What was his own take away from all of this? This had certainly not been the trip he had anticipated, and he was unsure if he would ever feel completely at ease about it. It was all making his head spin. Whatever else happened, he dearly hoped that this would be the only time he would ever meet Albert Speer."

He had come to Geneva with the most bold, longshot diplomatic overture Germany had made in a hundred years and come out on top. Goldwater had agreed to loosen the embargo and German business would surely breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nFor years, Germany had asserted its might through military dominance, yet Speer had now proved that they could also stand up in a war of words. That Goldwater, a man who had taken power on a platform of anti-fascist opposition and anti-German sentiment, had been convinced of the error of his ways was a great victory for the Reich - and for world trade as a whole.\n\nAs he returned to Germania, he was first greeted by Schmidt. "An excellent display, my Führer!" said Schmidt as he pushed a copy of the morning paper into his hands. The headline celebrated Germany's diplomatic coup, hailing Speer's overpowering of the USA's decision. It was a little embellished, as all German media tended to be, but Speer supposed it would do.\n\nAs he returned to his duties as Führer, Speer felt satisfied that he had proven his worth and demonstrated his new path for Germany. The time for tanks charging across Europe was over; now was the time for the Reich to take its place on the world stage as a true diplomatic player."

Goldwater had had enough and the world's press was already awash with the images of him storming angrily from the hotel, Speer himself emerging regretfully a while afterwards. He was not terribly surprised - the talks had been a long-shot after all - but he was disappointed all the same.\n\nThe condolences from Schmidt and the assertion by the German press that the failure was entirely the fault of the unreasonable and arrogant Americans did little to sooth his gloominess as he arrived back in Germania. The ceaseless messages from the major conglomerates lamenting their lost foreign assets left him gloomier still. He had failed. A man in his position could not afford failure. Weakness in the face of the tasks that still lay ahead for Germany was unacceptable.\n\nSitting at his desk, he considered where Germany might go from here. A relief package to dampen the woes of affected businesses was a given. A meeting with the economic bigwigs to determine alternate trade partners would also be essential. Yet no matter what, this failure would hang over his head for a long time. Securing free trade with the west had been one of his greatest diplomatic achievements. Now he had lost that and lost face all at once. It seemed that America and Germany were destined to be enemies."

The images of Goldwater emerging moments later showed a face tinged with equal parts irritation and smugness. That was exactly how he felt as he flew home over the Atlantic. It was a wasted journey, but at least he had made Speer look like a fool.\n\nWhen Goldwater arrived back in America, he found himself quickly swept before the journalists, all eager to hear his account of things. He smiled for the cameras, and waited for the hubbub to die down before speaking.\n\n"Mr. Speer is no different to his predecessor, nor any of those who tried to claim Germany in the past. He believes that his country deserves all the bounty of the free world without being a part of that free world. I tried to be reasonable, and I decided to hear him out in the interests of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, it is clear that even under its new ruler, the ego of the German nation knows no bounds.\n\n"Let this be a lesson to all those who rule with an iron fist. If you are willing to extend liberty, then liberty will extend its bounty unto you. If not, then the bounty shall forever be denied."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a smile as he returned to the White House. He had kept his promise to the American people, shown up the forces of fascism, and demonstrated once and for all that America would always stand tall in the face of tyranny. It would surely be a great precedent for the future of the world - and for the future of his election prospects."

Even in a state like New York, no place had room for a handicapped minority man. He worked odd jobs for years, barely scraping by with the help of the NPP's generous welfare programs. While he didn't care much for politics, his interest peaked at a president which promised economic prosperity for all.\n\nBut that was then. No more food stamps, they say, it's a waste of money. We need to slash welfare; we could be using that for the environment, experts claim. Austerity, designed to bring economic prosperity for all and reduce the national debt, has simply taken it from the people who needed it most. Robert sighed, cold in his own home.
