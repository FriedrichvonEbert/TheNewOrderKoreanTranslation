POLITICS_BOB_DESC:0 "미합중국 대통령이자 분명 세계에서 가장 강력한 인물인 로버트 맥나마라는 그리 열정적인 사람은 아닙니다. 국내외에서 고생한 수 년은 그로 하여금 감정이라는 것을 거의 없애게 하였습니다. 이유 없이 안정적인 민주주의는 있을 수 없으며, 안정적인 민주주의 없이 미국이란 있을 수 없습니다. 그렇기 때문에, 분열되지 않고 냉전을 살아나가려면 감정적 타협이란 존재해선 안될 것입니다. 효율성과 실용성만이 모든 것을 지배하죠. 더 많은 자원을 군대로 끌어오기 위해 군의 최저 지능지수 기준이 낮춰져야 한다면 그래야 할 것입니다. 미국인의 생명을 지키기 위해 어떤 외국 국가를 침공해야 한다면 그 또한 그래야 할 것입니다. 공공을 방어하기 위해 세금이 올라야 한다면 역시 그렇게 될 것입니다. 미국의 적은 미국의 연민, 후회, 두려움을 공유하지 않습니다. 그들의 정치체제는 우리로 하여금 자유를 필수적이게 하고, 그렇기 때문에 자유는 생존을 확보하기 위해 그 생존성을 더욱 키워야 하는 것입니다.\n\n매우 수준높은 교육을 받고 정계 입문 전에 재계에서 긴 경력을 쌓은 맥나마라는 언제나 감정 앞에 효율성을 우선시해왔으며, 이제 그는 그의 소망을 모든 미국 정치에 실현시킬 수 있을 매우 강한 위치에 있습니다. 그의 계획은 조세국을 통합하여 국세청을 일반적인 미국인들에게 덜 주제넘게 느껴지도록 개혁하는 것이며, 사회안전망을 축소시키고, 그의 통제에 대한 갈증을 해소시키기 위해 연방 권력을 급속도로 증가시키는 것입니다. 미국 정부의 비효율성에 돈을 덜 낭비할 수록 미국에게 매우 적대적인 독일과 일본에게 맞서기 위한 미국의 국방을 강화할 돈이 더욱 늘어나게 될 것입니다.\n\n이제 맥나마라의 거침없는 효율성 추구와 정치적 실용성이 워싱턴의 적폐들을 청산시키고 미국을 전에 그랬던 것처럼 두려운 거인으로 변모시킬 수 있을지, 아니면 수많은 전임 대통령들처럼 완전히 실패하고 말지에 의문이 남아 있습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 미국의 적들은 그의 정서적 욕망에서 너무나도 분리되어 있는 자를 경계하는 것이 좋을 것입니다. 그런 사람들은 세계를 단번에 심연 속으로 보내버릴지도 모르니까요."

USA_bob_72_appeasetherepublicans_desc:0 "While the Democrats may be on the upswing now that McNamara is in office, that doesn't mean that we can ignore the Republicans and their needs and desires entirely. In fact, that would make running the government that much harder and frictious, and that's the last thing the new President wants. Vice President Bayh has already an idea in mind to work with the GOP: the University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act. Ever since the federal government started giving grants to universities to help develop new technology, the debate over who actually owns the intellectual rights to the new developments has been a fraught one. This new bill will streamline it by giving the universities the chance to patent and profit off these inventions, since they did all the hard work. And the President is all for giving those that work hard on ideas and technologies to improve America's security and standard of living the right to prosper thanks to them."

USA_bob_72_appointrusk_desc:0 "One of the hardest working men currently working in the US government is Dean Rusk. Quiet and shy, he has a knack for details and can see many sides of the same issue, coming to the best conclusion after long thought. This is exactly the kind of man we need to oversee the Department of Defense. While Rusk's career so far has been in the State Department, President McNamara trusts him to negotiate the rivalries of the different branches of the military to work together to dual goals of defending America, and defending freedom.\n\nThe only opposition we have faced regarding Rusk's confirmation are from uber-pacifist Republicans like Senator McGovern, but they are the very, very small minority. Then again, they wouldn't like anyone to be sitting in the Pentagon unless they were a Hippie."
USA_bob_72_themcnamarapresidency:0 "The McNamara Presidency"
USA_bob_72_themcnamarapresidency_desc:0 "Robert McNamara is not who anyone would consider a charismatic politician. He's a numbers guy, having studied economics at the University of California, Berkeley and got an M.B.A. at Harvard before the war, and then serving in the Army Air Corps. He wasn't a pilot or front line officer, but conducted statistical analysis of bombers effectiveness, even as the Japanese pushed the Americans across the Pacific. After the war, and a stint in the upper levels of management at the Ford Motor Company, McNamara joined government service, working in the Department of Defense under multiple administrations, doing his best to make the US military the most efficient and effective in the world.\n\nNow, having experience in both the private sector, and turned the military into a finely honed machine ready to stand up to the Reich and the Rising Sun, he's ready to bring that experience to the nation as a whole. With the young and popular Birch Bayh as his Vice President handling the more public events, McNamara can do what he does best: crunch the numbers, find efficiencies, and turn the American government into a finely honed machine."

USA_bob_72_fillingthegovernment_desc:0 "The first call the new President is making is to George Shultz, a successful businessman who had served in several government roles over the previous decades, including on Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors, Secretary of Labor under Nixon, and an economic policy commentator and advisor over the years. This time, Schultz will be given the Treasury Department to run, so he will have some real power to go with his suggestions and plans. He also has strong opinions on foreign policy of the anti-fascist variety, which should make getting any budget increases we propose in the future to run through the bureaucracy that much smoother."
USA_bob_72_timetocleanhouse:0 "Time To Clean House"
USA_bob_72_timetocleanhouse_desc:0 "One of the problems with the old style of politics was that loyalty to the party and deference to ideology was the most important aspect of governing the nation, even if it didn't actually help America in the long term. President McNamara doesn't believe this: it's inefficient, values subservience to party more than competency in a subject, and leads to infighting and corruption. The best way, the only way, to run the country is to get the best people in the right positions, no matter their political leaning. The Republicans and Democrats may moan and complain as their candidates are shunted aside for non-political, or worse, NPP members, but it's all for the good of America. Nation over Party."
USA_bob_72_rallythedemocrats:0 "Rally The Democrats"
USA_bob_72_rallythedemocrats_desc:0 "The President is not a public speaker. McNamara is a numbers guy, and you can't convince stats with powerful words, nor can you change mathematical facts with soaring rhetoric. His words will never enter the pantheon of great American speeches like Washington, Lincoln or Kennedy. But when he does have something to say, and something that he can't simply hand to Bayh to do, it has to be important. And uniting the Democrats, to ensure they are all on the same page to support his administration, is just one such effort. While the speech he is giving to the Democrats invited to the East Room is full of cliches ("the best is yet to come!") and a couple awkward turns of phrase ("It won't be easy, it will be hard, it may even be difficult"), there is no doubt of the sincerity behind it, and his ideological allies are all the more supportive that he at least made the effort."

Now that the groundwork has been laid, it's time to make official the new McNamara Doctrine. It will not be simply an address to the nation like previous Presidents have done to outline their foreign policy, but it will become ironclad law. We will use our democratic institutions to show to America's enemies what they will soon be facing.\n\nI'd be quivering in my jackboots already!"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids:0 "Call Up The Whiz Kids"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids_desc:0 "In his time serving in the Nixon Administration, Robert McNamara had developed professional relationships, even friendships, with a variety of young, talented and incredibly smart men that soon became known as the "Whiz Kids" within the Federal Government. While they didn't have the top roles in government twelve years ago, working as Under-Secretaries or backroom specialists and analysts, now they are more than qualified to implement modern management systems into the government, focusing on the fields of economic analysis, operations research, game theory, and computing.\n\nAdam Yarmolinsky, William Kaufmann, and Charles Rossotti are just a few of the business executives and intellectuals that will be given high roles in the government, to bring a modern sensibility to the tired mechanics of government. The old timers and civil servants that rely more on patronage and not causing waves may not be too thrilled to be working under these new and radical ideas, but it's the President's decision, not theirs. So they better adapt or get out of the way."
USA_bob_72_politicsbedamned:0 "Politics Be Damned"
USA_bob_72_politicsbedamned_desc:0 "The President's primary efforts are all focused on foreign policy and the military. While, yes, the R-D's developed a campaign platform on internal affairs, McNamara is going to leave that quagmire up to Vice President Bayh and Congress to sort out. No, he's focused on the big picture, the whole world.\n\nThe only other people in Washington that cares as much about foreign policy as McNamara does is the National Progressive Party, who are as committed to anti-Fascism as he is. It may be heretical to the President's party, and may require having to agree to slashing welfare, or unsustainably increasing it to get one wing or another onside with his foreign policy, but that's for everyone else to worry about. As long as America is united in defense of democracy and freedom abroad, who cares?"

While they may not agree on much else politically, McNamara is willing to overlook that, to provide bipartisan support to his agenda. The Republicans may not like it, since they aren't going to get one of their guys to be the head of the Pentagon, but it will play well to the rest of the nation. The charts and polls show that."

Even now, as the boss of all America and with his own captive audience, he saw no reason for that to change.\n\n"During the election, I said that America was in to win the Cold War, not to outlast the Germans and the Japanese. And the last decade has proven that when push comes to shove, the threat of military force remains relevant - even decisive - in the nuclear age."\n\nHe flipped through the slides - images of South Africa, of Indonesia, of Egypt and of Iran.

Balding and unassuming at first glance, the party had pitched Rusk to McNamara as the 'safe' and 'uncontroversial' choice for the Pentagon.\n\n"You know what I stand for, Mr. Rusk. American supremacy against the Germans and the Japanese - and in military affairs above all else." McNamara continued, testing Rusk. "I want your honest opinion: can this be done?"\n\n"It's not a matter of can - it's a matter of necessity, Mr. President." Rusk didn't bat an eye before responding. "So many Beltway insiders say that nuclear weapons have made major power war obsolete, Mr. President. But in my experience, the road to fighting facism starts well before that point. It will be in the steppes of Manchuria, the South African veldt, the jungles of Indonesia."\n\nRusk leaned forward. "If America wants to win the Cold War, we'll have to fight on the peripheries of the world - with everything but nuclear weapons. It will need a military geared towards fighting anywhere, at any time. And we're nowhere close to that.""

Despite all the differences between our parties, everyone here agrees on one thing: a strong and assertive foreign policy."\n\n"What, just because we agree on promoting American interests abroad, we're suddenly going to wash twenty years of differences away?" Jackson frowned. "The NPP isn't going to be your best friend just because you asked, Mr. President."\n\n"If you thought this was a total fool's errand, I don't see why you would have agreed to come here at all." McNamara leaned back in his chair, but never once broke eye contact with Jackson. "I don't see why we can't work with each other."\n\nKirkpatrick and Jackson looked at each other.

"Whatever you need to make the NPP come willingly, you'll have it."\n\nThe line fell silent - and why wouldn't it? Here was the President of the United States, offering a leader in the opposition a blank check. A nagging voice in Jackson's head whispered that he'd inevitably tie his name to whatever the President had planned - and that if things went wrong, he'd be going down on McNamara's ship.\n\nMaybe that wasn't so bad, if they both believed in the same things. American primacy abroad - and if, in exchange, the President was willing to assure prosperity at home, then wasn't he getting the better end of the deal?\n\nThe next morning, Washington - and R-D party headquarters, in particular - received the news of Henry Jackson's nomination to serve as President McNamara's Secretary of Defense with a single, resounding cry:"

The Administration's approach to military affairs is suffused with statistical analyses and quantitative methods from the heights of grand strategy to the nuts and bolts of equipment procurement, envisioning an expansive force perfectly tailored for the battlefield of the future.\n\nObjections to the bill on the Senate floor were predominantly focused on the cost of President McNamara's military programs, with a force both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to its enemies being prohibitively expensive to field. Administration officials dismissed these concerns, noting that the American people had elected the President with a mandate to ensure American victory in the Cold War, and that the Administration would employ its same statistical methods to ensure cost-effectiveness in the pursuit of military superiority."

Not only was it the brainchild of an unprecedented bipartisan effort - uniting President McNamara's brain trust of advisors with the most hawkish elements within the National Progressive Party - it's DOM provision (Deployment, Overseas Military) authorizes the 'limited' deployment of American military units overseas, at the President's discretion.\n\nThe bill has had the unusual effect of uniting dovish segments of the NPP with constitutionalists within the R-D's in opposition to the bill, concerned that the FREE Act and the DOM provision would erode Congress' power to declare and oversee foreign conflicts in the pursuit of military adventurism overseas.

Social democrats within the NPP and fiscal hawks within the R-D's waged a successful campaign arguing against waste within the government and questioning the need to spend so much money on overseas military adventures even as the Oil Crisis continues to roil the domestic economy.\n\nAdministration officials put a brave face following the defeat, vowing that the President remained 'determined to secure American interests worldwide with the resources available.'

The bill's stated rationale to 'clarify and streamline the President's powers to conduct foreign and defense policy' - and its 'Deployment, Overseas Military' (DOM) provision, authorizing limited overseas military deployments at the President's discretion - provoked heated opposition from doves within the NPP and constitutionalists within the R-Ds.\n\nThe floor debate continued for hours, and eventually the opposition's argument that the FREE-DOM Act would gut Congress' constitutional role in declaring and prosecuting armed conflicts gained the upper hand, with the bill's backers failing to mount a spirited defense in the final hours of debate. The Administration - and the bill's backers in the NPP - refused to comment after the vote, and political analysts expect a prolonged period of internal party wrangling within both the R-D's and the NPP."

Sure, he made his name as Harvard's youngest professor, and helped save Ford from its postwar fiscal chaos.  But McNamara has his fair share of ideology.  In contrast to those who call for the razing of Japan or German Africa, he wants the Pentagon to take a more measured approach.  Fewer first-strike capabilities, and more deterrence.  Fewer rigid doctrines, and more counterinsurgency.  To his supporters in Congress, McNamara is a man who will shake things up, rationalizing the business of war in a new era of conflict.  The question remains, though: will he truly change the Pentagon, or will his efforts get bogged down in the old system?\n\n"

The Democratic wing of the coalition has sided with pro-segregation southern states, citing states' rights as an argument to allow for the preservation of the system. This has led to intense conflict with the Republican wing, which sees the enforcement of civil rights as necessary to securing freedom for all Americans. Still others have taken a middle-of-the-road stance and advocated for compromise wherever possible to prevent the complete separation of both parties.\n\nDepending on the route we take for this issue, there can and will be severe consequences to the unity of the party. Regardless of the outcome, far-right and far-left factions of the National Progressive Party will inevitably use the ordeal as a power play to gain votes from disillusioned politicians.

However, the left has refused to relent on civil rights, denying the Democrats and the rightist faction of the National Progressive Party the votes needed to pass the bill. The President continues to call for the progressives to 'restore national brotherhood' and 'follow a path that is acceptable to all Americans.'\n\nSenator [GetRFKOrJackson], leader of the NPP's social democrats, says that his camp is standing firm. Almost all of the C-NPP has turned down Bennett's call for 'unity'. Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, arguably the most influential Republican in congress, followed Kennedy's lead, stating that the bill was an "afront to foundations of the Republican-Democrat coalition". Rallying behind Kennedy and Johnson, many progressives believe that the bill will simply dampen support for Civil Rights legislation among the general public, while doing the bare minimum in actually achieving racial equality. Without their help, the R-D's will likely be forced to return to the drawing board to create legislation that the progressives find more amicable."

As of this moment, the votes are close, and it appears that when voting day comes, a select few congressmen will decide the bill's future.\n\nShould the R-D's fail to gather sufficient support, it is likely that they will be forced to cancel the vote and re-draft the bill to be more left-leaning. If this occurs, it is possible that they will be caught in a catch-22; if they change the bill to be more liberal, they will lose conservatives, but if they don't, they'll lose the progressives."

It seems that the President has caught himself in a tight spot, in which he cannot pass the bill without the support of both groups, but will lose the support of one by compromising with the other.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the bill is likely to be re-drafted in a much more progressive fashion than before.

This clause was specifically targeted at southern states who administered 'literacy' tests that were nigh-impossible to pass for African-Americans, voiding their right to vote.\n\nObviously, these state-sponsored tests were in violation of the 15th Amendment, and thus illegal under federal law.

For centuries, many regarded African-Americans as commodities to be used and traded, even igniting a conflict which tore our nation asunder." \n\nIt seemed as if the air had been sucked out from the hall.

"Regretfully, we continue to witness injustices, with African-Americans suffering social, political, and economic wrongs at every level of society.

The effects of this decision will surely be felt for years to come, both in policy and in the makeup of the already-weakened coalition.\n\nSo far, Democrats have taken an entirely conservative stance in the Civil Rights debate, arguing against provisions to outlaw race-based discrimination.

America, exhausted after years of turmoil, had seemed ready to put the matter to sleep. \n\n'What does our soothed conscience in Washington mean for the African-American?' President Bennett recalled Robert Kennedy's scathing words in the press, following the Senate vote. He was troubled, of course. In the face of America's most trying political crisis since the Civil War, who wouldn't be afraid that they hadn't done enough? \n\nHe looked at the image of Jesus on the cross. Bennett was a faithful man, and this - this Act was what he could be comfortable with. Never mind Thomas Monson; this was a matter for Bennett alone, a dilemma shared by any man of faith in office. Bennett had been true to himself, and that would have to be enough for America."

WFB.556.t:0 "The Working Man Fights On!"
WFB.556.desc:0 "Good morning, Senators, I appreciate your diligence in making it out here to work this early. Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss." With the President's words, the Republicans sat down across from the President's desk. "Gentlemen, the anxieties revolving around the Silver Act's upcoming vote could lead to a complete collapse of support. As President, I cannot allow factionalism to tear apart our country at the seams; thus, gentlemen, you have all been chosen to head to Chicago to meet with Harrington in C-NPP territory. If we can't patch up the economy by ourselves, then we'll have to extend our hand out to the inner cities. I know things haven't been the best between the Democrats and the Republicans recently, but let's try to smooth all that over, what do you say, gentlemen?" The Senators nodded and quickly left to meet with Harrington himself.\n\nThe city had been bustling with activity, and after waiting around for traffic, the Senators' driver dropped them off at a bustling office building on the corner of Ninth street. Finally, the men found their seat across from the Missourian politician himself, looking as annoyed as he seemed impatient. "Well come on, we're busy all day trying to fix what Bennett and the Democrats couldn't." he asked. While sorting through papers, "Now, what is it that you all need over here?" "Well, Mr. Harrington, the President is looking to propose a deal with you and all of the C-NPP." one Senator said. For the first time in the conversation, Harrington stopped sifting through papers and turned to look at the man. "You're telling me the leader of the Democrats and our nation itself has decided to strike a deal with us? After all the harassment, he finally wants to take a step down and offer us something? Now, please, let me know what the President could try to offer us after all of what we, and the miners of the United States, have had to bear?" After taking a deep breath, one of the Senators spoke up, "Now, I know things have been rough between you and Bennett, but he's offering a direct promise here. He's worried about passing the Silver Act; so, if you choose to get your branch to favor the bill, President Bennett has offered a clause which would ensure the jobs of silver miners across the United States, along with a firm agreement to allow the R-D's to open up greater communication to the C-NPP." The leader of the C-NPP tapped his fingers across the desk while offering a look of suspicion towards the Republicans. "Tell me, what makes the President so willing to finally work with us?" Harrington said.\n\n"Because to be honest, sir, President Bennett believes that if we don't fix the economy now, no one's going to be able to.""

WFB.557.desc:0 "They said this job was going to be fuckin' easy.\n\nAfter a long night on the Congressional floor, President Bennett assembled us in the Oval Office itself the next morning. Three combat veterans, three Southern Democratic Senators, three figures in the Silver Act vote. "Good morning, gentlemen." He said. "Let's face the light here: the Silver Act's vote is creeping up, but the Congress remains polarized, and I fear the worst; so, I'm sending you three down to the Serpent of the South himself, George C. Wallace to guarantee the extra votes. Understood?"\n\nAnd there we were. The room was silent. The three of us were silent. The Governor of Alabama just sat there, quiet, the whole fucking building was just quiet. "Senators, may I ask what you three are doing down here in my office?" he said, as the pouring of whiskey into five separate glasses flowed in front of us. One Senator picked up first, coughing, "Well, sir, the President sent us here to-" "Oh, my apologies, gentlemen, please, the travel must have dried your throats; please, enjoy a drink." He interrupted. "Don't worry, Mr. Governor, I do not drink." I said, shooting me with eyes like daggers. "Now, as I was saying, sir, President Bennett sent us here to discuss the proceedings of the Silver Act coming up, and how we can align our interests for the betterment of the nation." the Senator said. Wallace swiveled his chair to face the man, stating, "Align our interests? Funny little phrase you put together there. Now, what could the President offer that I may want?" The air in the room tightened like a noose around a criminal's throat. "Well, segregation, sir." the younger Senator with the Southern drawl voiced.\n\nWallace turned."So, Bennett's finally ready to ease down on protecting the Afros? Well, you have my attention, gentlemen. Go on." the Governor asked with a wicked smirk and unending stare. "Well," I finally spoke up, "the President would be glad to have your support, as well as the FR-NPP's support of the terms of the Silver Act. In exchange, he'll look into delaying the work towards Civil Rights legislation." The room stood silent, and still as Wallace's face twisted with contemplation. Suddenly, the room exploded with the slamming of the Governor's fist onto the desk, succeeded by a fierce cackling. "Well, gentlemen, you can go tell Bennett that Governor Wallace shall be considering his proposal to rectify relations with the NPP and the Democrats. For now, however." He stopped short, clearing his throat. "A toast, to the people of the United States." I shakily led our side of the toast and downed the liquor before leaving."

President Bennett has organized a celebratory lunch to praise key members of his Administration, along with some special guests from high society, people of honor, and foreign governments. The mood is high as President Bennett prepares to take to the podium and make a speech.\n\n"My fellow Americans, honored guests, members of my Administration. Today, we stand as one America. One Organization of Free Nations. One world. Over the past few years, we have achieved the greatest accomplishments, soared to the highest heights, and have healed the wounds left from this decade's past. The economy is booming, our people enjoy rights like no other, democracies all across the globe know that their way of life is no longer at stake. The Nazi scourge in Germany, and the Imperialist menace in Japan are beginning to know their place. While their empires of dirt and toil collapse, our nations grow and prosper. We stand united! The torch of freedom burns bright!"\n\nRabid applause erupts from the Rose Garden. The jubilant crowd, fired up from words of passion and wisdom, has hope in their eyes. The future to them does not seem so bleak anymore. Thirty years from now, when their generations ask what they did during the great cold war, everyone in attendance can simply and confidently say that "they won.""

With low interest rates, adjusted oversight, and more provisions, a lucrative section of the finance industry has just exploded. New applicants fresh out of college walk through the office doors seemingly every day. And on the other line of their phones and meeting with people who want to invest, business confidence is being revitalized.\n\nDevin hangs up. He never thought after barely getting his degree, he'd be working in a practically brand new industry. He resigned to a middle management position, but was now making his own money and helping other Americans make it too. To his side, a new arrival sits down, carrying a cardboard box of belongings.\n\n"Hey." The two men exchange an awkward handshake. "You've been here a while, right?" Devin nods. The new arrival stutters a bit, as he moves his chair to face Devin. "Are you sure this whole thing is okay? For something so new, it seems to be doing too well..."\n\nDevin nods, and puts a hand on the new arrival's shoulder. "Look, man.

They drill our military, they send our boys to die in South Africa, they have massive investment into our economy as investors and trading partners, and our diplomats are forced to play second fiddle to American ones. Michael knows that all too well, being a part of Australia's diplomatic corps. Perhaps, deep down, he was only worried about his 1st son, Gil. If those Yanks send him to die somewhere else, he wouldn't know what to do.\n\nThat is, until the American Ambassador paid a visit to Canberra today. And with him, he brought some very interesting news.\n\n"President Bennett has readjusted his policy dealing with members of the OFN. As of today, we'll be withdrawing some of our own administration and diplomatic staff, and giving more autonomy to the Australian government in terms of who and what they want to proceed with diplomatically."\n\nMichael couldn't believe his ears. After the speech from the ambassador, he turned to the man next to him. "Hey, mate. You really believe what this Yank is saying? They've been up our arse for decades at this point."\n\nThe man nodded. "That Bennett really is doing his best to equalize OFN policy. I may not like the Yanks either, but they're doing their best to finally even the scales. About bloody time, if you ask me."\n\nMichael had a sigh of relief internally. Years of worry, and reform is finally upon us. Even if he still had doubts, the new Administration in Washington was at least trying to not be the hegemon in which the OFN relies on. Much like before, Michael knew with confidence now that his opinion was shared with many Australians."

 USA_gld_68_go_with_regan_desc:0 "Rebuking the moderates thins the line between Goldwaterian economics and a better cohered market for America. However, with Don Regan at the reigns of the treasury, it's now imperative to remain on the same page with him and tug him along in the right direction. He has a tendency to romanticize supply side policy without clearly following its actual stated objectives if political expediency presents itself more attractively. Optimistically, referring him back to his boss' unwavering, literalist fealty for the Constitution will make him think twice if needed. It will all be easy enough if you can follow the 10th amendment, kill monopolies, cut government, and emancipate the American economy from the welfare state. Keep the market free, and keep it healthy."
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down:0 "부드럽게 하라"
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down_desc:0 "Statism cannot be cut down in a day, and the Republicans are not all bad; the balance between left and right is what keeps the country afloat and Goldwater knows it. This, of course, means setting Don Regan aside and keeping the incumbent Treasury Secretary in his appointed position. As his dear friend Buckley might advise, if they can simply be persuaded to explore the options with a Goldwater presidency and market, it will be easier to extricate them from thinking government is the soothing balm for all social wounds. Goldwater will make his cuts into welfareism and state apparatuses more gradual in exchange for an easier time pushing his objectives through an already divided Congress. In due time, the reigns will be secure, and America set right."
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression:0 "불경기에서 탈출"
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression_desc:0 "Our economy cannot and will not recuperate from the Depression without letting it sort itself into order before applying any government bandaids. To Goldwater, a significant reason for perdurable American economic success in the 19th century was the wisdom against adversely impacting the market with artificial government competition; deviating from which is certainly what wrought the cancer that is corporate monopoly upon the world, and shifty union men along with it. Open competition, free trade, and resisting the urge to make the government's teat a congregation of suckling infants who'll take generations to recover their prosperity, even more so their independency thereby will bear their laborious fruits in due time. The object is a process which respects the rule of law, for which Goldwater has all the patience in this world."
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy:0 "건전한 재정경제"
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy_desc:0 "Sound and fiscal means, quite frankly no more promiscuous dalliances with experimental social aid, not a bit more of the old, fruitless rigmarole of pumping money into the states until they comply with Federal standards, and not a whisper of mention for subsidizing failure with people's hard earned tax dollars. Industry will be stimulated by more unrestrained trade with America's remaining allies with emphasis placed on hard cash getters like American coal and plant grains for exports, and European luxury goods (in limited quantities), minerals, oil, and dispensable commodities for imports. Broad markets and narrow Federal waste will lead the American economy to stable triumph."
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation:0 "프로그램 평가"
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation_desc:0 "The more useless programs, the more the government spends on gratuitous, self-expanding ventures that harm and hamper more than they help. The market becomes plainly impotent when the government subsidizes failure or bails out economic decrepitude, anchoring it to the measly pittances the Federal bodies are actually capable of throwing at the problem. More programs mean more tax money thrown in directions that people could have used to make it out better on their own and of course ever higher taxes to exact the funds needed to support such a bloated apparatus. As such, it's time to cleave welfare and benefits of the like that are better provided by the people most directly involved. From corporate headquarters to country farms, it's high time to bean crippling dependency on government money in the head."
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies:0 "농업보조금 절감"
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies_desc:0 "Farms are an irreplaceable component of American infrastructure, but what good are they if they are forced to wastefully produce more than they can realistically distribute? Goldwater submits the only thing worse than the explicit endorsement of perishable excesses, is the implicit funding of non-production to maintain an imaginary placeholder. And since when did the 10th amendment sanction this sort of foolish meddling in agriculture to begin with? Let the chips fall where they may, let farms and farmers live up to their proper potentials, and good riddance to these cumbersome subsidies, suffocating price supports, and counterintuitive production controls. If farmers cannot cultivate our land without the Federal government mucking up the works, the country will never get around to making a living off of it."
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare:0 "낭비적인 복지 삭감"
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare_desc:0 "Within the Goldwater approach, what he and other fiscal rightists call "welfareism" is the scourge of a healthy state, market, and nation. If it suspends the 10th amendment for any excuse whatsoever in order to permit a government imposition on the country's economy, it is an inherent outgrowth of this affliction. The larger body of Federal aid, social programs, and stimulus pick-me-ups comprise the spiteful organism that primarily embodies said "welfareism". It stunts the people and businesses by making the government a strident economic competitor in the market which drives competition off the rails rather than the government searching for non-competitive foul play as like its delegated responsibilities from the trustbusting 1910's. It worsens the government by giving it a part it does not know how to play with the competency instilled from the consequences of being a private body who must suffer the results it reaps from both successful and failed operations. It becomes the proverbial bull in the China shop, while somehow acquiring proprietary rights to the entire China shop. Anti-welfare propositions intend to consign that chaos to yesterday."
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget:0 "균형있는 예산"
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget_desc:0 "With Congressional spending on the path to an equilibrium status, that equilibrium itself will need to be secured. The measures needed to accomplish that lie in pruning yet more spending outgrowths, redundant government offices, even whole departments that are, in accordance with the 10th amendment as well as a groaning Federal pocketbook, foundationally gratuitous. No more will the Keynesian doctrine of self-debt be permitted to crawl along the floorboards of the Capitol and White House, debts will be addressed by unfailingly consistent payment plans where possible or go un-incurred in the first place. If the government can't pay it, loans should become a last resort rather than a convenient stepping stone to gratifying the social magicianship of big-headed policy men. If it involves profligately overarching regulation, it should be examined to see how it can be cut down rather than gymnastically complicated into being "workable". The budget should not be a wishlist for fanciful politicians, but rather a well-oiled machine to keep the country running, and that requires a compact unit that meets bare civic necessities instead of drooling over wasteful stimulus packages."
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling:0 "채무상한제 적용"
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling_desc:0 "Inordinate, reckless expenditure has become Congress' default resolution for various national crises. The administration's fiscal conservatism demands this halts immediately so the government can apportion tax dollars more judiciously; as well as explore other solutions to social and infrastructural maladies than vomiting Federal coffers dry into them. To prevent extremity from outdoing itself, Goldwater and company are pushing a cap to the debt ceiling. However, Goldwater knows from his Senate days that this manner of push may be fatally tainted from its outset. Knowing this, his cabinet is hiding a card deck of various spending stopgaps off the table to enter play in the event that the debt ceiling is allowed to fizz out of the bottle. The extraneous buck stops here."
 USA_gld_68_the_working_men_should_work:0 "노동자는 일해야 한다"
 USA_gld_68_the_working_men_should_work_desc:0 "Next year's budget proposals have caused an uproar, as spending on welfare programs like employment insurance and Social Security have been massively cut back, along with a whole series of other programs that conservatives have long claimed only incentivises laziness and freeloading off the government. In a White House Press Conference, President Goldwater himself has stood up for his proposals, saying that these programs have been given too freely in the past to "... those that can, and should be working, but choose not to because they think the government can provide for them." But it's the last line that dominates headlines: "Working men should work!""
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs:0 "관세 철폐"
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs_desc:0 "Goldwater has always been a believer that America can, and always will, build anything better than anyone else. However, that can lead to situations where American made products are expensive and out of reach of millions of poorer Americans. Regan has proposed that maybe tariffs should be cut on imported goods from other countries, to allow cheaper products from overseas to provide for these markets that American companies aren't providing for. Plus, since the US isn't spending as much money on welfare anymore, we don't need to collect as much money as before. So why not make the accountants jobs at the Treasury Department a little bit easier?"
 USA_gld_68_skin_the_budget:0 "Skin the Budget"
 USA_gld_68_skin_the_budget_desc:0 "The budget is still hinderingly bloated, and Goldwater figures it is high time to simply skin its blubbery carcass alive. Patience with its engorged stature has only led to failure in the limited four year stints of other chief executives, and Goldwater refuses to be another complacent zookeeper that feeds into its bulk. The administration will begin an effective immediate lobby push for reduced social programs, moderate prohibitions on Federal loan taking, slashing a chunk from commerce regulations, particularly as levied at farmers, small businesses, and interstate merchants. Special, pricey, and cronyist protections for unions and massive companies: out. More money for defense, civil services, and necessary infrastructure: in. Cut the fat and produce a smaller budget in proportion to the realistically smaller legitimate duties of the Federal government."
 USA_gld_68_conservative_finance:0 "보수적인 금융"
 USA_gld_68_conservative_finance_desc:0 "Government spending is forecasted to be well down from previous years, which makes future tax cuts that much more enticing. With the lazy bums forced to find jobs since their monthly free money has vanished, there are now millions more people looking for work. So what if the bleeding heart liberals are crying at us for pushing poverty levels up? It's only because they aren't working hard enough. With an expanded workforce crying for jobs, we can now encourage companies to invest and build in America, making all the stuff our nation will ever need. They don't need to build their branch plants or invest overseas. We already have the largest single market in the world. America First!"
 USA_gld_68_austerity_in_finance_abundance_in_defense:0 "Austerity in Finance, Abundance in Defense"
 USA_gld_68_austerity_in_finance_abundance_in_defense_desc:0 "War brings arduous necessities, among these is acknowledging when to cut back other public expenses in order to serve the country's ability to wage the wars needed to protect it. The American war machine hasn't thoroughly greased its joints in what seems like ages, and little eases friction in them quite like money for war machines and a place to send them. Needless to say, this entails a comprehensive austerity to reserve the funds for purchasing equipment, arms, and such; not to mention the scrap materials to manufacture them. Public allotments for social programs, subsidies, and commerce enforcements evaporate from their original applications and resurface back in the Defense Department's coffers via executive order and urgently phrased, persuasive communiques to Congress. The skin is pulled tight to Uncle Sam's face and he's letting the excess come out in munitions and engines to drive them to their scheduled destination."
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan:0 "럼즈펠드의 계획"
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan_desc:0 "A vaguely technocratic ideal of the military, Donald Rumsfeld's program is one for endorsing hardware over manpower, while paring down, refining, and reapplying the select droves of men we already have enlisted (usually in more sparing placements and field assaults, but on what are deemed to be more strategic contact points). Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age. Goldwater in his air force background finds this appealing if a tad wishy-washy in its forcefulness. Nonetheless, it would prove an immense shift in American war doctrine, and, if the war is lost, we'll lose more money than men."
 USA_gld_68_mcnamara's_vision:0 "맥나마라의 비전"
 USA_gld_68_mcnamara's_vision_desc:0 "In Washington quite a few of the big wigs in Goldwater's military cabinet, chiefly Robert McNamara, have had a mana from heaven realization; more troops mean we can simply swarm the RK forces with raw numbers. The Nazis are already reliant on strained slave labor conditions for their resources, even a good portion of their conscripts. If they can be exhausted thoroughly via good ole fashioned G.I. mass deployments and mass encirclements, they can be driven back, their resolve as well as their personnel depleted and broken. No nation on Earth save Japan could withstand the full blooming mobilization of America's young men against it all at once. Those paltry few that could would usually need weapons of mass destruction to definitively repel the pressurized application of so many well-coordinated invaders. Enough men will send the Reich packing, of this McNamara is positive."
 USA_gld_68_a_specialized_defense:0 "A Specialized Defense"
 USA_gld_68_a_specialized_defense_desc:0 "The average grunt, noble though he is, is proving vastly insufficient to cope with the most battle-hardened RK units. In tandem with the adverse, novel climate in which the war is fought, such lack of veteran specialty in jungle combat is becoming disastrous for American forces. As such, the request has been made and granted for trained special forces units for whom underhanded, unorthodox warfare tailored to the difficult African climate is an object rather than an inconvenient resort. In lieu of overwhelming the Germans with old fashioned G.I.'s en masse, a more scalpel-esque approach will be adopted. Saliently, these divisions will engage the enemy in booby trapping, sabotage, guerrilla tactics, deep reconnaissance measures, skirmish and ambush oriented firefights; the genuine article of commando-focal warfare. If all goes swimmingly, the Nazis won't be able to out-adapt this rigorously versatile approach before it is far too late."
 USA_gld_68_better_vehicles:0 "Better Vehicles"
 USA_gld_68_better_vehicles_desc:0 "The country's armored warfare capacity is long overdue to be updated. This means introducing, manufacturing, and developing superior trucks, half-tracks, tank destroyers, and of course, tanks. With a fresh steel bulwark driving at their weary heels, the Krauts scarcely stand a chance. An increase in armored vehicles, particularly tanks will provide a boon, both literal and figurative to the average G.I. who will be able to call a much harder hammer down on skirmish prone swathes of RK-held territory. To boot, modern tanks can aid in the eventual push back to conventional war doctrine as the Germans are compelled to do battle in the open air as well as African villages."
 USA_gld_68_military_is_of_public_interest:0 "The Military is of Public Interest"
 USA_gld_68_military_is_of_public_interest_desc:0 "Without our servicemen and their well-worked tools, the country's shores would fall to the jaws of fascism, and as such each sound man alive can see the import behind a well-muscled military. As a matter of national livelihood it should take a role on the center stage of government spending and prioritization. Greater portions of collected taxes will be delegated to the defense budget, and the budget itself will be marginally enlarged. Public support of the armed services will be encouraged, war austerity policies fostered, factory jobs lauded, and domestic morale safeguarded. The land of the free and the home of the brave will live up to its name under Goldwater as it has so many times before."
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration:0 "Land-Air Integration"
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration_desc:0 "Aerial warfare is precisely President Goldwater's wheelhouse as a senior USAAF veteran, a period in which he doubtlessly learned a key lesson about air support, which is that it can only reify ground troops' ability to function for so long, and with only so much efficacy in being high flying craft opposed to enemies well-equipped with flak cannons. That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile. An encroachingly irreplaceable element for American G.I.'s as it ferries them with facility, speed, and force to each front as battles ever-changing-ly unfold; providing a formidable hailstorm of leaden cover fire whenever needed. Synthesized with hardened infantry, the helicopter and its tactics are a revolution in American war-making ability."

 USA_gld_68_specialized_demands_support_the_best_corporations_desc:0 "Immense arms have to be mustered against a foe that won't fight fair, even larger ones to strike them down once they are flushed out and forced to do battle on an even, open plain. The gargantuan demand for better guns has transformed into an equally exigent insistence for arms with growingly staggering caliber and destructive capacities. Larger artillery pieces, more efficient mortars, and bombs that can level the fortified installations which dapple the enemy's lines; anything with a bang big enough to ensure they think twice about advancing or sticking it out. The guns of Goldwater's service years are no more with modern technology coupled alongside the need to beat down a newer foe."
 USA_gld_68_limited_conscription:0 "Limited Conscription"
 USA_gld_68_limited_conscription_desc:0 "With the war at hand, it is hardly unreasonable to start making some demands of those who live in this grand republic. Great men have to risk their lives for it without fail throughout the annals of history, and that time has come again, both for it and the liberty of our dear friends in Africa. Far from being lethally drastic; minimal conscription measures are what Goldwater has in mind. A selective service and lottery system will be more than apt to bring in the surplus manpower necessary to bow the head of the Reichskommissariats. Every man who gives his life for Africa's liberty will go down as a hero, and those heroes who haven't stepped forward may yet be found."
 USA_gld_68_lessons_from_saf:0 "Lessons From South Africa"
 USA_gld_68_lessons_from_saf_desc:0 "It occurs to any forward thinking man of war or the world that one can only wage war as successfully as he knows the grounds where he wages it. It's about time we took measures from the playbook of the local guerrilla fighters and integrated them into our own combat doctrines. As our allies they should be more than willing to aid the force superior in strength to them on their side. That might will only supplement their own so much if it is left to languish confused as it is consistently outwitted by a far more locally acclimated enemy. Spotting unique styles of booby trap, learning what to listen for in the underbrush, and understanding ambush positions in the foliage before they can be sprung among other things will all work towards our boys' favor."

 USA_gld_68_well_trained_men_need_good_guns_desc:0 "The firepower needed to raze the fascists from their jungle roosts has proven to be greater than ever imagined. More of the defense budget will be repurposed towards the manufacture of only the finest quality of mass issue small arms, and new designs befitting a jungle soldier's war considered for service. Flame-based and explosive projectile weapons capable of being fielded by small companies, platoons, and squads will also enter development and selection to enable their progress through the sweltering verdure populated with Nazis. There are few things that can overpower a vile jackboot, but a preponderance of arsenal in the hands of hardy G.I.'s is among them."

To put it mildly, this translates to yet another upping for the military's ever flowering new demands, with another matched-ly extensive addition to their coffers. War and its fruits are never costless, such is the eternal burden of free, fiercely principled nations who must resort to it against such tyrannies as the Nazis. Arms and armor manufacturing, conscription, and industrial production orders will all measurably intensify for the war effort's sake, without which victory is forsaken."

 USA_gld_68_more_men_more_munitions_desc:0 "It's an imperishable fact of armed struggle that you never know the lengths to which your dedication and nation may be tried. The manufacturing foundries which fuel the conflict's success must be tried yet further with an increase in locales, loans, and assembly lines to get more guns, gear, vehicles, and shells to the latest wave of valiant young Americans to stomp the RK's guts out. Regarding those courageous youth; there simply are not enough of them in the service to deploy against the Reich's tides. Conscription will be accelerated to meet the call of duty against the unrelenting Nazi specter. No man can fight forever, which is why fresh faces with fresh reserves of combat vigor must sally forth to crush the fascists head on. With their well-oiled tools, they will end this, for as Goldwater knows, you don't start a fight you have no intention of finishing."

 USA_gld_68_military_keynesianism_desc:0 "Keynes may have been a fool in most respects, but at least he grasped the needs of wartime production and the benefits it confers for the larger market economy. The debt we owe to our coffers is negligible against the backdrop of the ferocious clash throughout the bottommost ranges of Africa. The prospective boom from cycling against the ravages of war with raw production is tempting to say the least too. Reganist financial doctrines shift to reflect a Keynesian, demand-focused military industrial policy that the administration is convinced can give the desired push that will collapse the enemy's resolve through sheer, brute war production overclocking. The war has to be fought, and political economy cannot stand in the way."

Safety can always be bought in more guns and war supplies, so why not secure oneself in the event of Reich getting any more audacious or threatening they already are?

Some of the smaller states are pleading for more money to invest into their economies, but the larger states jealously guard the money, seeking to keep it where it already is.

While some economists say that both plans could be risky, even dangerous as the economy is growing so much faster without the limits of gold and silver, and cutting all ties to some of the largest, if undemocratic, powers in the world could cause an economic recession, Goldwater is very intrigued with the proposals, and as a break from the past.

Not a day passes without eagle-eyed staffers carefully scouring over documents and testimonies, ensuring every "i" is dotted, every "t" crossed and every check given to and received by every Congresscritter within the capital accounted for. Surprisingly, a good number of the accused don't even have ties to labor unions at all!\n\nThese recent developments indicate a slow, seemingly inevitable shift in scope: From a crusade against union lobbying to a crusade against Congressional avarice itself. Unexpected indeed... but not unwelcome, believes the President. Certain options may have revealed themselves as a result, and it would not do to overlook them simply because they were unaccounted for at first."

Such is the respect by which virtuous men regard their time-proven principles, and the extent to which their words are fully practiced.\n\nAs a Democrat with principle, President Goldwater's noble crusade against base corruption shall not discriminate by party affiliation, nor by any category for that matter.

Somehow it seemed fitting that these two parties, so alike one another in policy, also share the same visceral need to buy with money what they cannot buy in the ballot box.\n\nAny further moves against half the President's government will certainly make tumultuous ripples in America's already-fragile politics.

Corruption has seeped so deeply into America's cultural milieu that all its people, in some way or another, are complicit in its continued survival.\n\nSuch a dismal state of affairs cannot, must not be ignored any longer.

Few were spared justice as the federal government exercised its powers to their uppermost limit in order to accomplish what other administrations could not.\n\nPresident Goldwater now stands atop the rubble he had gouged off America's latest party system, despised and praised in equal measure.

Whereas the NPP were beaten bloody over their illicit affairs with trade unions, the Democrats and (to a slightly less extent) the Republicans shone like diamond-studded gold, unblemished and untarred.\n\nWhatever the repercussions may arise from the campaign, American conservatism has surely won from it a triumph worth celebrating for a good long time.

The union today operates as its constituent parts have always had since the age of letter and telegram: A cartel of organizations that have given the country's labor geographical bounds, organizing them into territories for each to rule as they see fit.

This paled, of course, to the worst case scenario: Hoover's boys getting caught where they shouldn't, kicking off yet another political meltdown so soon after the Nixon scandal.\n\nSo in his wisdom, he decided to stick with the arguments he's absolutely certain will make a compelling case.

Its forests, its waters, its hills and fields and mountains -- our nation's natural plenty is and should be an object of pride for those fortunate to call these their own.\n\nYet men still seek to imperil America's pristine majesties with misdeeds to sate their own greed; much of them, in fact, are companies with the gall to call themselves Americans.

Clothed in blood-stained red parroting the false German prophet's heresies, socialism has left more scars on Uncle Sam and his children than all the world's fascists put together. Like the hydra of myth, socialism grows despite injuries that would kill lesser men, and it will return to our shores again and again until our cities are crushed beneath its crimson feet.\n\nAll American presidents are duty-bound to cull socialism before it grows into a juggernaut. President Goldwater sees no reason to abandon this responsibility."

The system that has supported American politics since independence was thus also built to work only when compromise is observed and good faith assumed by all parties. Conversely, a few bad actors can send the government into a screeching halt with filibusters and quorums.\n\nFor the President, none fit the title of "bad actor" better than the opposition's ardent leftists. No middle ground can be found with men who stubbornly insist on wholesale nationalizations, state-funded bribery, and other such reckless, pie-in-the-sky policies. Nevermind Rockefeller's advice -- America's better off if these men were excluded from its politics altogether!"

The information they extract will have much use in his hands, whether as "informed predictions" or... something markedly less pleasant."
 USA_gld_68_an_anti_socialist_education_desc:0 "The biases and beliefs we hold to our graves coalesce in the classrooms of our youth, hardening with age. Because a nation has such a narrow window to enculture its children with a shared identity, school curricula emphasize civic education as early as grade school or their equivalent thereof.\n\nSimilar logic applies to reinforcing their worldview from certain ideologies -- a man taught to steer away from socialism's allure in his childhood is less inclined to join protests and vote for socialist-friendly politicians than one whose tryst with it began in college. Consequently, inoculating the nation's youth from socialism entails enforcing anti-socialist curricula in all levels of education. This is a mission the President is all too happy to undertake."

Some sympathetic, if unusual, fellows from the opposition congratulated him in private -- apparently "despite (his) traitorous heritage" to quote one of the letters verbatim -- for conclusively dealing with one of their party's unwanted sores.\n\nHe knew better of course. Only fools with the arrogance of Hercules, but with none of his strength, would say that the socialist hydra was slain for good.

However they disagree on the means to achieve peace and prosperity for our people, either side's adherents can take comfort in knowing that the other will eventually be swayed to theirs because of the common goal they share.\n\nFascism, on the other hand, deifies unthinking obedience and lionizes the omnipotence of strongmen. Nowhere else can one find an ideology more anathematic to American values than the Reich's slavish adherence to the supremacy of one race over all mankind. To combat this unnatural foe, and their present sympathizers within the United States, President Goldwater was convinced to set aside its century-old blood feud with socialism for the time being."

Often these solutions involved the brutal acts his Nazi inspirations conduct, chief among them wanton violence and the persecution of America's sheltered oppressed.\n\nJust as mildly put is President Goldwater's antipathy for a man who would shoot him out of a principled hatred for his father's ancestry. An intern questioned if his personal spite for the beloved fascist had driven the order to ruin him with blackmail from CIA infiltrators; to that, the Arizonan simply answered with a knowing smile and a pithy about cutting a snake's head off before it can slither away."

The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep.

So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance.

Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice.

Such behavior will eat away at the slivers of unity the government has left; yet if they break away, then the hope of a functioning Congress will soon follow.

Just as much effort was spent on predicting the fallout of such a move in America's conservative half. Needless to say, its displeasure -- though weakened by Wallace's self-induced damage -- will bellow loudly from atop chimneys, church steeples, and Capitol Hill's marble dome itself.

He sought to advance the rights of states, but in doing so had compelled the federal government to commit many egregious violations against them. His hatred for the Black had instead become the Blacks' greatest asset.

Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting.

This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to "improve" states' rights.

Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America.

With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again.

Subsequently, citing the urgency and need to protect the environment from degradation, the president has signed the bill into law through executive order, bypassing both houses of Congress. The administration insists on the legality of the executive order, while citing its necessity in order to ensure America's nature is preserved. Some voices within the republican half of the Republican-Democrats have denounced this move by the administration as authoritarian. Nevertheless, few others have protested at this measure of the administration.\n\nThe bill is a great step forward in environmental legislation. Regardless of his firm belief in laissez-faire, President Barry Goldwater has always had a special appreciation for America's natural beauty, enough that he would see it protected by the federal government. Particularly younger voters seem to agree with and appreciate the president's environmentalist tendencies, making it likely that he is to enjoy a small surge in support among this demographic.\n\nWith the bill, the president's bill has created a new federal agency: the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA will be made responsible for ensuring that all of America's nature will be preserved and not subjected to needless and excessive pollution, through helping develop and enforce environmental regulation in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe president can rest a little easier knowing that America's beauty is preserved for the next generation."

 GLD.2.t:0 "A Meeting of the Minds"
 GLD.2.desc:0 ""It's no secret we have our share of disagreements, Mr. Rockefeller. Press won't stop speculating on how we'll fall out first." The president shifted in his unfamiliar seat. The Oval Office was far more spacious than the one he'd left on Capitol Hill, and was still an unfamiliar space to him. Across from him, Vice President Rockefeller adjusted his glasses and spoke.\n\n"That's what you called me here for, isn't it? To get ahead of any unforeseen issues. I'm sure we won't agree on everything, but every President and Vice President since Eisenhower has needed to deal with that. I can't promise you my support on everything, but I can keep silent on matters that are less offensive to the Republican Party. Such as your opinion on the unions."\n\n"The unions have nothing to fear from me, as long as they stay in touch with what's good for the nation and not just themselves. But let's start with what we can agree on. The parks bill, and the agency I've proposed to deal with environmental issues-"\n\n"You'll have my full support. Now, about the cabinet- most of these choices, Curtis is a fine statesman, and McNamara is certainly qualified enough for the job. But Regan- Regan concerns me. His policies-"\n\n"What changes would you make to this list, Mr. Rockefeller?"\n\n"Excuse me?"\n\n"Regan is non-negotiable. He's critical for securing electoral support from certain special interest groups and frankly I'm inclined to agree with his view of government's role. I'm asking if there's any changes you want. Katzenbach for Attorney General? Give Udall a position? I've worked with him before, I could do it again."\n\nGoldwater handed the folder of lists to the vice president. "I'm not the firebrand they told you I was, Nelson. We can work together.""

 GLD.3.t:0 "A Conservative Cabinet"
 GLD.3.desc:0 ""Thank you for meeting me on such short notice Nelson." Barry Goldwater led his running mate into the Presidential Suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. It was just days after the election, and while the White House was still occupied for a few months yet, it was time to prepare the transition.\n\n"Of course, Mr. President."\n\nGoldwater stifled a sigh. There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Party, while Rockefeller was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the R-D's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Rockefeller to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Rockefeller, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nOf course, Goldwater would never come out to say such a thing publically, even if it was true.\n\n"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. I just wanted to let you know who I'm planning on," Goldwater said, handing over a piece of paper with some scrawled handwriting on it."\n\nRockefeller adjusted his glasses as he sat on the sofa, looking over the names. As he got further and further down the list, his frown got deeper and deeper.\n\n"These are all Democrats," Rockefeller said. "I don't see a single Republican, or, rather, anyone that isn't a conservative, Mr. President. This could divide the party, especially with certain voters." His voters, those that voted for the R-D's because Rockefeller was on the ticket.\n\n"The people voted for a conservative government, Nelson. Besides, you're here. You're at the table. That should be more than enough to make the liberals happy."\n\nRockefeller stood up, handed the piece of paper back. "It's your choice, Mr. President. You should have the people that agree with you around the table." His tone of voice made it clear that he wasn't happy about it. He turned on his heel and left the room. Goldwater shrugged his shoulders and returned to work."

 GLD.5.desc:0 "Barry Goldwater sat at the Resolute desk, looking at the binder of paper in front of him, labeled with "Current Federal Social Security and Subsidy Programs" on the cover. He rubbed his forehead, staring at the binder with almost two hundred pages of paper.\n\n"You have got to be kidding me," Goldwater said, adjusting his glasses before flipping open the binder, to see an index that listed all of them in alphabetical order. "Thirty years of welfare, and this is the result?"\n\n"Yes, Mr. President," Donald Regan said. The Treasury Secretary stood in front of the desk, shaking his head. "The first thing I did was get my staff to create this, with a brief description of each program the federal government runs, so we can figure out what we can get rid of."\n\nGoldwater flipped the page to the first program, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the AAA, and quickly read the description. "Pay farmers to not plant some of their land, and sell excess livestock to the government?" He frowned, grabbed the page, and with a satisfying rip, tore it from the binder. "That's the first one to go."\n\nThe President stuck his finger part way into the pages, and flipped the binder there. The Works Progress Administration, WPA. "Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure. And hire writers, musicians and painters to create art?" He tore that page out with a particular vengeance. "The last thing the government should be doing is paying anyone to splatter paint on a canvas. If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold."\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. "Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War," Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. "Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month.""I agree, Mr. President," Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. "I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss. Most of the rest can be amalgamated, and then have their combined budgets reduced to an appropriate level."\n\n"I want this binder to be less than half the size," Goldwater said, slamming the binder shut. "By the time we are done, this should be a pamphlet, not a doorstop.""

 GLD.6.t:0 "Cutting the Agricultural Budget"
 GLD.6.desc:0 ""Socialist Agriculture." That's the phrase that is being thrown around a lot lately amongst Democrats, right wing groups, and those around President Goldwater. The fact that millions of dollars a year are being spent to prop up thousands of farmers in the South when their crops don't yield as much as expected due to the lack of fertilizer and overused soil has become the newest bone of contention with Treasury Secretary Don Regan and his supporters, who seek to let the free markets determine who prospers and who doesn't. Why would anyone be willing to pay farmers to lose money? If they can't cut it, then they should sell their land to more successful farmers and get out!\n\nAlready there are protests by farmers throughout the South at state capitol buildings and federal courthouses, angry at how the government has been treating them over the past decade.\n\n"First all the Civil Rights nonsense, talking about making the blacks our equals. And now they want to destroy our livelihoods? There won't be a single free farmer left in Dixie by the end of the year if this happens. Everyone will be broke, or no better than a slave!"\n\nAlready activists have been going to small towns throughout Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi, telling the farmers about what their Democrat President is trying to do, and how they can fight back by supporting the National Progressive Party, especially the Far Right faction of the NPP. It remains to be seen if it will be enough to topple the stranglehold the Democrats have had on the South since the end of Reconstruction, but some Democrats are clearly afraid for their jobs in the next election."

 GLD.7.t:0 "Cutting Welfare Down to Size"
 GLD.7.desc:0 "Various Presidents and administrations over the years have sought to leave their legacy on the nation, usually with bold programs to make the life of Americans better, easier, more productive and more. So catchy names and programs with a word-scramble of acronyms were created. The SSA, the WPA, the AAA, the FRA, NIRA and several dozen more. Slogans like "The New Deal," "the Fair Deal," and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Republicans or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

In fact, they were tough, brutal, and sometimes deadly. But if you worked hard, if you worked smart, you could reach a higher station in life than any that could have been imagined back in The Old World.

But the President is also keenly aware that he will need help from the more liberal Republicans within the party in order to pass such a budget, and compromises will have to be reached. In fact, the proposed cuts that are coming out now seem to actually be rather moderate, and more technical than anything. Few programs are being shut down, while others will be merged to realize efficiencies in administration and the bureaucracy, which usually is the largest expense anyway in these kinds of assistance programs. Some funding for grants to states on health, education, food and shelter assistance and more is also being reduced, and more requirements are being put in place to ensure that only those that actually need it are receiving the funds.\n\nIn general, no one is happy with the budget, but few are really angry over it either: Democrats are displeased that the spending isn't even more drastic, while Republicans are disappointed that funding for some benefits that they consider worthwhile and important has been reduced. The NPP is on both extremes: demanding more social spending, or demanding the whole system of Social Security and Medicare and more be totally demolished.

While he didn't get the chance in 1964 to put his plan into motion, now he might get the chance with a conservative like Goldwater in the White House. They had both worked together in the Senate for several years before hand, and Goldwater liked what he heard from Bennett's speeches and proposals for more international trade and re-establishing the Gold Standard. However, Goldwater decided against bringing Bennett onto his cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, instead going for the hardline conservative-libertarian Donald Regan, as he wanted someone he could trust in the Senate to help get his proposals through. Since most of it was Bennett's brainchild, so much the better.\n\nBy pursuing the twin goals of Free Trade and the Gold Standard, Goldwater and Bennett have what they perceive to be a winning strategy: increased prosperity, an end to the economic stagnation of the previous generation, and giving the American people hope for the future. Now, what shape Free Trade would take is still a matter of debate in the halls of power, as Goldwater's anti-fascist views means that increased trade with Germany and Japan would be abhorant to him, while concern over the size, wealth and even political will of the OFN members mean they aren't as great as markets as business leaders would like. And restoring a true gold standard can mean either great things if done right, or a huge economic crash if they fail.

 GLD.21.desc:0 "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\nBut tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\nWe are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions.

Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear."\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargos with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republican-Democrats, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, "Free Trade" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Democrats, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this "Goldwater Way." Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of "Free Trade." It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Democrat, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

Officially, it's been stated that the goal of the summit is to encourage more trade between the members of the OFN in a spirit of freedom and democracy, while still maintaining their strength and will to stand up to the Fascists and Imperialists in Eurasia.\n\nHowever, the US President has not been quiet about his desire to forge free trade deals and open more markets, which some of the smaller nations are hesitant, if not downright hostile to. After all, nations like Australia and South Africa, with smaller economies and businesses, would have to face off American behemoths like Ford, Standard Oil and Boeing. With vast resources, skills and labour, the US conglomerates could quickly monopolize these new markets, undercutting their competition and driving the smaller, local companies out of business altogether. But at the same time, the thought of Australian Holden cars or Canadian Avro planes being sold into one of the largest markets in the world with little in the way of tariffs is also deeply appealing.\n\nBut once we are all together, with the diplomatic niceties of being greeted by an honor guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a delicious dinner of wild-caught salmon in their bellies, the real work of international affairs can begin.

Officially, it's been stated that the goal of the summit is to encourage more trade between the members of the OFN in a spirit of freedom and democracy.\n\nHowever, the US President has not been quiet about his desire to forge free trade deals and open more markets, which some of the smaller nations are hesitant, if not downright hostile to. After all, nations like Australia and South Africa, with smaller economies and businesses, would have to face off American behemoths like Ford, Standard Oil and Boeing. With vast resources, skills and labour, the US conglomerates could quickly monopolize these new markets, undercutting their competition and driving the smaller, local companies out of business altogether. But at the same time, the thought of Australian Holden cars or Canadian Avro planes being sold into one of the largest markets in the world with little in the way of tariffs is also deeply appealing.\n\nSo we have to make the decision to go or not. While increasing trade between the members of the OFN would be good, we also need to be concerned about the alliance shifting away from its main goal of protecting us from the Fascist and Nazi menace."

Now as the doors close and the ministers and secretaries take their places around the table, small flags to mark each delegation, the biggest moment of the OFN Economy Summit has arrived.\n\nFor weeks in Washington, President Goldwater has been discussing with advisors, cabinet members and congresspeople about the best course of action in regards to the OFN. There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external Fascist threat from Europe, Asia and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n"I've gathered you here today to discuss...""

Despite a last ditch attempt at a Filibuster from an NPP Senator that stretched late into the night, calling the bill a "...disaster in the making for the hardworking American..." Yockey's supporters denounced it as a return to the failed interventionist politics of the past. However, the bill passed with the majority support from the R-Ds and the more moderate members of the NPP, as it was fairly non-controversial in the halls of power. Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports. This will be a victory for everyone: the price of raw materials, oil, consumer goods and more from nations like Canada, Australia and South Africa will be cheaper for US companies and consumers, while giving an economic boost to America's friends and allies."

The unilateral effort to remove trade barriers was supposed to make trade between America and her allies cheaper and more expedient, which would have benefited all sides, or so Goldwater and the RDs have claimed.\n\nThe L-NPP was opposed from the get go, as they claimed the bill would pulverize the American economy, and more importantly, the American worker. By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their "America First" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck president.

And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade.

But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt. Business was strangled under the increasing cost and frustration, leaving only those massive corporations with armies of lawyers to survive and stagnate, becoming monopolies. Unions too, for what are they but bloated bureaucracies that only survive to steal money from hard working Americans?

 GLD.56.desc:0 "As he waited for the news cameramen to get set up, President Goldwater took a deep breath of Yellowstone's cool, clean mountain air. It was such a pleasure to get out of the endless hurly-burly of Washington, with its filth and smoke and smiling monsters waiting to sink a knife in him as soon as his back was turned. Yellowstone's quiet beauty brought him back to the simpler, happier days of his boyhood, running across Arizona's scorching scrublands with his brother and his sisters. Every American deserved to grow up like that, raised in nature's loving embrace.\n\nThe director let the President know they were ready. Goldwater took his place behind the podium, his back to the expanse of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The President had long been committed to the cause of environmentalism and the preservation of America's natural beauty, and he intended this to be his seminal speech to introduce the public to his love for America's National Parks, and to hopefully sway them to support his program for greater environmental protections and regulations. Goldwater often found it difficult to believe that so many Americans were willing to sacrifice nature's bounty in exchange for the pollution of industry and the soullessness of the urban sprawl. Taking a deep breath to steady his thoughts, he began.\n\n"My fellow Americans. Today I speak to you from Yellowstone National Park, greatest among America's natural monuments. Fifty years ago, this great nation made the commitment to protect and preserve our natural heritage, for these parks belong not to any man but to us all. I would carry on this proud tradition, and revitalise our national parks so that they may be enjoyed by our children and our grandchildren, and all who come after."\n\nAnd so he continued, extolling the virtues of the national parks and laying out his plan to enact a series of programs to preserve the environment and help the national parks grow and prosper. Accompanied by the distant crash of the Lower Falls, the President ended his speech with a quote by the naturalist John Muir-"

It creaked behind him as he gazed up at the immaculately white ceiling. Lethargically reaching forward, he picked up the cup of coffee she had left him and took a brief sip. Hot as the Yellowstone Caldera.\n\nIt was official: his dream of a government dedicated to protecting America's natural places had come to pass. The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency would be made public the following morning in a press conference, when he would, once again, face the flashing lights and the dark eyes of the cameras he had come to know so well.\n\nKnocking back his coffee, Goldwater allowed a small smile to grow as the scorching liquid warmed the inside of his chest. He reflected on the obstacles he had skirted around or smashed through to bring the EPA into being. The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill. It had been a battle well fought, and a victory well earned. After the endless bustle of the past few weeks, the President was finally able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a hot cup of coffee and a moment's peace, as well as the knowledge that he had forever ensured the preservation of America's natural heritage."

 GLD.58.desc:0 ""America has been through crisis and chaos for over twenty years now. Since our humiliation at the hands of Japan and Germany, our society has strained and struggled and our politics have become polarized and acrimonious. Friends have become enemies, and opponents have become allies in a whirlwind of fear and panic. The forced merger of the old Republican and Democratic Parties, and the rise of the National Progressive Party to form the unwanted, yet unbreakable two party system that has been with our nation almost since our birth, has led to ideologues and populists of both extremes. Screaming at each other on the radio and on television, and drowning out the center in a flood of hate and anger. The moderates of both sides, those that can agree on compromises and get stuff done. There has been no direction, no course. America is a broken nation."\n\n"But today, we begin to repair it."\n\nIn his first major speech to the American people since his inauguration, President Goldwater identified many of the issues that faced America, including a divided political scene, a stagnating economy, and a listless population. But he also laid out his policy agenda, which is as bold and daring as any seen or heard since at least the Great Depression. While the details were limited, and Goldwater said that he would find the best course of action through discussion with his Cabinet and Congress, he promised that whatever it is, whatever he tries to do, it will be for the good of America as a whole.\n\nNewspaper editorials and radio commentators, those that often speak of gloom and doom, were much more upbeat the next day. Even Goldwater's opponents said they could respect the earnestness and forthright manner that he spoke, even if they couldn't agree with his prescription on how to cure the USA. But for those that voted for Goldwater in November, it was exactly what they wanted. A promise to solve the many problems that face America, no matter the cost."

He'd spoken to his advisors the previous day: Rockefeller strongly supported it, Regan disapproved, insisting it would be a waste of government funds, and McNamara and Curtis were relatively blase and disinterested. Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday!

It needed teeth, but it shouldn't be so powerful as to completely alienate the world of business and their 'friends' in Congress. And, of course, there was the small matter of how exactly the EPA would be funded, meaning which program would have its budget drained to bankroll it.\n\nThe President rested his chin on his hand. So many problems, all requiring decisions. He couldn't let himself forget that what he was doing here was important, that it would change the lives of Americans for decades to come. Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later.

McNamara's proposal of what compromises and amendments to make to his initial plan for the Environmental Protection Agency lay on the desk, the object of his ire.\n\nMuch to his irritation, the President was forced to admit that McNamara's ideas would certainly be effective at pushing the EPA through Congress and establishing it with minimal blowback. Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line. If he signed, he'd be tarnishing one of his longest-held dreams, giving the polluters carte blanche to continue raping the natural world in exchange for agreeing to follow a handful of token restrictions. When he touched the pen to paper, he felt the familiar fiery indignation building in his chest. Would Michelangelo have knocked off David's head just to satisfy his critics?\n\nThe President faltered, torn. It'd be easy to sign and endorse McNamara's proposal, just a few strokes of the pen and he'd be able to avoid the anger of his voter base, and the party conservatives, and the business community. But, said that other little voice in his head, this is what you've been fighting for. Don't let them take it from you.\n\nDon't let the bastards win."

He hoped the one with the blonde beehive hairdo would be there today. She knew just how he liked it.\n\nAlready the President was pondering what the public would make of his new bundle of policies aimed at increasing the prosperity of the National Parks program by expanding the size of many parks and drastically increasing their federal funding. He knew plenty of the Republicans and the progressives in the NPP would rail against what they saw as him taking money out of the hands of the poor and giving it to a gang of tree-huggers and mountain-climbers, but he knew, with just the slightest smile, that it wasn't too likely they'd be able to sway the public to their side.\n\nThe fact was that most Americans would be glad or at the very least ambivalent towards the good news that the National Parks would continue to be a major pillar in the preservation of America's environment. Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

This is every individual, business and governmental organization we have identified as being potential cohorts in a plan to subvert your environmental policies. As you can see, it contains members of Congress, local governments and members of the Fortune 500, including many individuals we have previously tagged as potentially engaging in corrupt activity."\n\nThe President just sat there, saying nothing, staring into the middle distance.

Hailed as a major blow against electoral corruption, the FECA was intended to level the playing field and root fraud from the political process.\n\nNevertheless, there will always be people willing to skirt the law if they think it'll get them what they want. Money makes the world go round, after all, and the marble halls of government are packed with those willing to have a few greenbacks stuffed in their back pocket.\n\nPresident Goldwater had been furious to discover businesses were working with politicians to subvert his environmental legislation, but his anger then was a pale comparison to the Hadean rage that burst from him when he was informed that major businesses had made illegal donations to pro-business, anti-environment politicians in exchange for votes. Lobbying is one thing, outright bribery is quite another.\n\nDriven by that ball of cold fury that burned within him, Goldwater decided to push the big red button and call out the corrupters and their lackeys who were so willing to undermine America's democratic traditions to continue unabated their plunder of the environment. And so, ever the believer in The System, he took them to court. Let's see how smug they are when the judge reads out their misdeeds for the whole nation to hear."

Another book of esoterica joined the pile, and Richards pushed over the shelf for good measure.\n\nAn hour of searching later, the raiders departed leaving chaos and broken furniture in their wake.

Our education system needs to focus more on the failures of Communism so that we could prevent any possibility for a socialist revolution in the future.\n\nThis latest Senate-approved bill will accomplish just this task. The bill revamps the social studies class by adding our own anti-Communist propaganda to further lead students away from the false glimmer of the red star. A Knoxville, Tennessee teacher described her support for the new bill, "I mean, look at Russia when they adopted Communism. There's no telling what kind of authority stretches across that barren land now. I would hate to live in an America that looks like those thousand-piece puzzles. Hopefully our kids grow up to hate those wretched Reds."\n\nThe LNPP responded as predicted: a few small protests here and there across major U.S. cities. One such protest in Minneapolis turned violent as the leftists were struck by average citizens whose everyday lives were disrupted. The protest came to a halt and every member of the LNPP retreated as quickly as they arrived. Members of the right wing claimed a huge victory following the failed protests, and groups are already planning their own unified counter-protest."

Some newspapers were reluctant, while others began bizarre campaigns against the LNPP, with one local Utah paper calling all leftists "Communist Mutants From Space". Even the more moderate positions of the LNPP are coming under fire for "attempting to inject their awful beliefs into our pure American society".\n\nSince the inception of this campaign, any newspaper, regardless of the amount of readers, will be federally funded for any anti-Communist articles. This has led to a growing number of pro-Yockey and fascist newspapers gaining attention, especially in the South and Midwest, the old headquarters of American Populism. The state-approved "hate literature" has allowed anyone with an anti-Communist platform to speak their mind unopposed, but this may lead to later problems once the idea of socialism is eradicated."

"I know you are not in favor of regulations and such, but most of them are in place for a reason. We no longer poison people from what they eat, or injure them when they are building skyscrapers."\n\n"Don has shown me a lot of research that shows that if we get slackers off the dole, and let companies actually, you know, make stuff, that the whole economy will prosper," Goldwater replied, trying to keep a calm demeanor. "That will be enough to keep the R-Ds together."\n\n"Not if we are sending thousands of people into starvation!" Rockefeller yelled. "Are you willing to let that happen?""If it makes the country better off, then fuck them!" Goldwater bellowed. The argument went back and forth like this for half an hour, a clash of conservatism and liberalism, with tempers flaring and eventually Rockefeller put his foot down.\n\n"Mr. President, you have a choice. If you do what Regan is suggesting, you can kiss the Republican-Democrats goodbye. I know quite a few congresspeople that would rather work with the NPP than you. So, it's your choice to make."

Without once mentioning Goldwater's name, Harrington has picked apart, piece by piece, the whole domestic policy of the President, focusing especially on the budget cuts to welfare programs.\n\nWhile Goldwater has been attacked and criticized by many others for these same plans time and time again, they were barely pinpricks to the President.

"And I will assure them that the proposed budget will still make it possible for those that absolutely need the social safety net will receive it."\n\n"Our biggest focus is trying to ensure that federal finances will be sustainable for the long term. This means that some cuts will have to be made, and revenue increased. Welfare and tax reform will go a long way to solving both issues."\n\nThe President spent over half an hour answering questions that the reporters asked regarding costs, who would still qualify, and how the cuts will be implemented over the next few years. While there are many who are disappointed in the cuts, especially in the Republican faction of the R-Ds and members of C-NPP, early reports from pollsters indicate that many swing voters have been convinced by the President's speech.

However, many senators are saying that it was even worse than they thought once they got the chance to read the budget, which led to the Republican Walkout today.\n\n"It is perfectly clear now who the President is supporting," one senator said to reporters as he left the Capitol Building. "And it isn't the average American, or those in dire need of help and assistance. All Goldwater is helping is his libertarian and arch-conservative allies, who want to run roughshod over the poor and struggling."\n\n"This isn't simply balancing the budget," another Senator remarked. "This is an outright declaration of war on the poor, the colored, and disabled. How can we even consider such a proposal without looking at the blood on our hands?"\n\nDemocrats have long supported cutting such spending, seeing it as wasteful, ineffective, leading to a larger government and reducing the liberty, freedom and work ethics of the American worker.\n\nThis may be a huge blow to President Goldwater.

 GLD.266.desc:0 ""Last Sunday afternoon, in New York City, our very own President Goldwater began a speech that would bring all moderates together in victory, with no man left behind. When the media confronted Goldwater for his attacks on leftist organizations, he had this to say:\n\n'Never before in my life have I ever made such a deep realization of my own actions. Several newspaper articles written about me were... very difficult to comprehend; it was at that moment I realized I had put my own interests above the interests of all of you. We aren't a civilization built on hate and prejudice, like the Nazis or the Kenpeitai; we listen to the voice of the people here.'\n\nCritics easily judged Goldwater's introduction as 'too obvious that he was trying to roll back on his beliefs' and that he was being 'blatantly deceitful'. However, as Goldwater went on, the critics grew more and more silent.\n\n'I have not been listening to America's voice in these past weeks. I have decided to overhaul my previous policies on anti-socialism. Already I am working to pardon over a thousand LNPP members who were imprisoned for their affiliation. In the land of opportunity, it is essential for everyone to have a say.'\n\nPublic response was mostly favorable, but leftists were overly supportive and FR-NPP members withdrew their acclaim for the President entirely. Ever since the speech, membership of the LNPP produced a surge not seen since last year. I, for one, am thankful to have a President that listens to the people and can respect our constitutional rights as citizens. I will proudly continue my work under the Patrons of Franklin to denounce any and all extremist activity in our great nation." -Patrick Henry, The Washington Post"

One reporter commented, "How can a world leader introduce all these pro-censorship measures, denounce all of it the next day, and expect us to believe he has a sudden change of heart? This isn't a simulation he's playing: Goldwater's supposed to be one of the most powerful men in the world."\n\nGoldwater had answers for every question the interviewers asked, but the man's voice was shaky and his posture was uncomfortable. He didn't show much confidence in his responses, either.\n\nThe media's word on the speech was very unpleasant towards the RDs: many journalists called Goldwater the "Opportunist President" for his attempts to flip his beliefs to gain extra votes. FR-NPP politicians considered Goldwater "a cheating liar" and "the first bogus President in a long time". According to a Gallup poll released after the conference, Goldwater's popularity with the American people decreased as much as 10%. Only LNPP politicians showed any kind of support for Goldwater, but even they are convinced that the President will backstab them more to appease the right-wing crowd."

Officer Alistair MacKinnon was killed instantly, his partner Officer Brock Tarrant taking cover and calling for reinforcements. A tense 7-hour siege ensued with the perpetrators. An FBI negotiator was brought in from Quantico, but the perpetrators refused to respond to any attempts at communication and fired on police when they attempted to recover Officer MacKinnon's body, the dramatic exchange captured on film. On the Governor's order, the FBI was stood down and the perpetrators were engaged by riot police. By 8:45 PM, police had breached the house and killed all four perpetrators, all confirmed to be white males aged 22-38. They also took one unarmed white female into custody. Upon investigation of documents recovered at the scene, the perpetrators have been identified as members of a fringe-right terrorist group comprised of former followers of fascist criminal Francis Yockey. Though it may sound incredible, according to their records, the group, calling themselves Avengers for America, were formulating a plan to assassinate the Hollywood actress and outspoken left-wing activist Jane Fonda for her connection to the Black Panther Party on an upcoming film shoot in Maryland. For now, Mrs. Fonda and the residents of Baltimore can rest easy knowing another threat to their freedom has been defeated.\n\nPresident Goldwater set the newspaper down to look over the photographs. One filled almost half a page, showing Officer Tarrant in a particularly heroic pose, engaging the Yockeyites as his fellows attempt to retrieve the supine body of his murdered partner. After some consideration of the PR benefits, Goldwater picked up the phone. Perhaps they could use Officer Tarrant..."

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer-drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement stand for the NPP's nomination in 1972.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody. Sipping his coffee, the President wondered what to do about the situation. He could put an end to their little commie propaganda campaign, but it might look like a restriction of free speech. Alternatively, he could just ignore it and let them have their poster-boy. No doubt they'd run out of steam soon enough."

Today's speech consisted of his plan to improve the economy, invest in the defenses of the OFN, and handle America's foreign policy. However, as the former Arizona senator dragged on, his words began to target specific parties in the United States.\n\n"I've encountered plenty of 'bad apples' in the political system of our country, but I have never seen a party more destructive to our way of life than the LNPP. You can't find a good politician in the group, they're all bad! And they want to introduce harsh civil rights policies that would change the country all too quickly!

 GLD.union.1.desc:0 "For much of his near-sixty years of life, President Barry Goldwater had maintained one routine without ever skipping a day. At around six in the morning he would wake up, make for the kitchen, and prepare himself a cup of coffee. Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning.

The statesmen of Congress are no less vulnerable to pecuniary concerns than the working man, after all -- what was a little quid-pro-quo with the local union for some pocket change?\n\nNaturally, any man of principle would feel incensed at such blatant corruption. The Arizonan himself was reminded too much of New York and old Tammany Hall -- a well-oiled machine of bribes, favors and ballot boxes -- for comfort.\n\nAnd so it was that he said just as much to Don in a private lunch, to which the Secretary of the Treasury replied shruggingly:"

But know this: Corruption undermines both the integrity of the government's laws and its people's trust therein."\n\nHe soothed his parched throat with a gulp of bottled water. "If these... frauds, as Director Hoover describes them," the President continued, "were proven to have used their subordinates' money to enrich themselves and their political allies, rather than to better their workers' lot, then I will not hesitate to wield all the implements the Constitution has bestowed upon my office to see these men answer to the Blind Lady in court."\n\nA nod from the journalist as she sat down.

Their playbook is a masterstroke in both its simplicity and its grasp of men's inner machinations: Workers join a union and get all these wonderful benefits, but not before coughing up their cash every now and then and pledging their fealty. Just like that, John Doe gets conned out of both his savings and his free will, tempted by the money to hedge their bets on collective fraud disguised as the highway to a wonderful career. For the rudely awakened... Well, peer pressure and the threat of exile do just fine keeping these comrades in line. Meanwhile, their bosses are free to do whatever they will with countless millions in ill-gotten paychecks. Despicable and abhorrent, but successful all the same.\n\nThis time the roast on Barry's mug was strong and potent, scalding, bitter. It roiled and burbled on his tongue as he read one of several thousand tragedies the White House's mailbox had received since he announced his war on union corruption. After reaching the last dot, he tossed the letter aside and scratched another missive to Director Hoover.\n\nSomething had to be done before these duplicitous "vanguards of workers' rights" swindle another hardworking American.

If they refuse, a shakedown that escalates in a span of weeks until they acquiesce or leave. So-called "scabs" have no place with the boys, after all; more importantly, bosses love to see their numbers grow.\n\nWhat happened afterwards resembled more of a protection racket than a confraternity of workers. Aforementioned benefits were "delayed" due to supposed problems with their employer, all while payments were leaving their owners for their boss's pockets. The unions stifled all attempts to speak out against such cases of unfair treatment, either with community conformity or with brute thugs masquerading as their "comrades" glowering behind every eye corner.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, these men took the federal government's hand, no matter how questionable its presence, if it meant the chance to sterilize these reservoirs of corruption from top to bottom..."

Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Democrats bellowed their assent, Republicans muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their "commitment to beloved principle". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill.

The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Republicans share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence.

Neither is she in a scenario where its mighty factories and its two hundred million citizens should be harnessed to their maximum extent. He isn't even an officer of the Armed Forces, supportive he may be of their vigilant duties. Nevertheless, he believes "full scale war" is an apt description for what he will wage against the country's largest trade union. Their fall will cause ripples across the country. Not as severely as war, but the ensuing riots will surely make battlefields of every city. Half of America will harness their support towards his crusade; the other half will make impediments of themselves for every step it will take. This noble task will consume his faculties in the months ahead, same as any general faced with planning operations in wartime.\n\nBarry knew he was making a deal with the devil when he invited Director Hoover for a "personal conversation" in the Private Dining Room. What extraordinary times this must be that the Arizonan would ever fathom acceding to his demons' advice against the greater evil that stood in his way.\n\nIf nothing else, he consoled himself, men from the bright future that awaits afterward won't have to make the hard decisions he will a few minutes from now."

 GLD.union.13.desc:0 "After months of draft-drawing and consultations with business leaders and key political figures, President Goldwater and his allies have finally introduced their first piece of anti-union legislation in Congress since his controversial "War on Unionism" address. Dubbed the Labor Union Standards Bill, it aims to introduce new requirements in order for a trade union to organize with the federal government's blessing and operate within its jurisdiction. These include a clean record sheet for the past twenty five years, limits on the revenue they report to the IRS, non-affiliation with socialist parties active in the United States, and others.\n\nSenators from the National Progressive Party decry the President's latest initiative, calling it "(a) gross infringement on the American worker's right to organize." This sentiment has been echoed by the AFL-CIO, who have since called for nationwide strikes and protests against the Bill's passage in Congress. Time will tell if their efforts will bear fruit against the President's own efforts."

The bill itself handily passed in the Senate and House by considerable margins, despite protestations from the National Progressive Party and a number of Republican Congressmen who broke ranks to vote against its passage -- futilely, as later events had proved. "This is an appreciable victory over the trade unions who wish to put their own fortunes over America's," the President said cheerfully to the media afterwards, "but we must not mistake it as a cause to invite complacency. Make no mistake: My administration will never cease in following through with its promises to their successful conclusion."\n\nThe American labor movement is in uproar following the bill's ratification. In a joint statement with notable activists, progressive officials and renowned labor organizers, AFL-CIO President George Meany rebuked President Goldwater for "failing to uphold the political liberties of American workers", and that the union will "do whatever it can to prevent the American worker's rights from further attack". Isolated riots have since been reported in Baltimore, Sacramento, and Cheyenne..."

He regrets that the country's legislature failed to heed the mandate which a majority of Americans had shown their support for on Election Day..."\n\nPundits and political observers have since offered their own opinions on the future direction of the President's anti-union campaign.

His calm tone belied the energy with which he delivered the announcement that the White House has filed a case against America's largest trade union directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe public's reaction was instantaneous, divisive, and expected. Democrats proclaimed their full support; the NPP and their progressive allies prepared their demonstrations and coalitions. American households and workplaces had an opinion of their own by day's end -- whether the majority are in favor or against the President's latest action, pollsters such as Pew and Gallup have yet to ascertain.

Internal security within the courtroom had run itself ragged keeping its participants from speaking out of line and protestors from interfering with the proceedings itself. Although arguments were kept from devolving into bloody fistfights, if only just, the entire trial simmered with a consistent level of snide and creative insults exchanged between government and union throughout.\n\nNot that insults were all both sides could offer, of course. The Justices had their fill of evidence and testimony as well: Laws, prior court decisions, compromising materials, even emotional outbursts from several witnesses. Each side did whatever they could to convince the law of the other's guilt, if not their own innocence.\n\nBut there were only so many hours in a day, and everyone involved expected a speedy trial.

But he thought himself tough, that there's always next times lying in wait just ready to be caught with fresher hands, new opportunities to get what he wants where he wants it.\n\nHis copy of The Washington Times, just a few hours old, had crumples and tear notches with how tight his shaking fists latched onto its margins. In front page, bold text:\n\n"SUPREME COURT RULES 7-2 AGAINST PRES. GOLDWATER"\n\nThere was no getting out of this loss, that much he knew.\n\nWith a wordless cry he threw the crumpled newspaper aside. A hand reached out for a mug of coffee on the Resolute Desk, only to find no purchase. Right, he'd thrown that too, hadn't he? Now it was just fragments of wet, sticky ceramic on the marble floor. Hit the bird splayed at the center of the Oval Office square in the eye too. Cleaning staff can take care of the mess.\n\nSighing, he rose up and hobbled towards the windowpane. Warm and sunny outside, like the good Lord couldn't give a rat's ass about his loss. What did he do to earn His disfavor? Doing the good thing? Something to think about while he spends the rest of his term making like a crippled goose, then.\n\nUnbidden, the old verse from the Book of Psalms left his lips:"

Pure black's never easy to get used to, even after drinking nothing but it for days.\n\nBut it was easy to lash out when he heard the news. Lash out at his fellow Americans for not backing him to the hilt. Lash out at the Justices for letting the union bastards get off scot-free. Lash out at God for not sending him a miracle at the end of so much effort. Hatred was strong and raw then, so very tempting to wield.\n\nThankfully, reason quickly reasserted itself. He had his victories, the unions have theirs. He may not have brought the whole thing down, but neither had they gotten away without a nasty limp. He still has half of America on his side, and a good chunk of Congress to boot. His campaign's wounded and bleeding -- but it's not yet out. Never out, if he had his way.\n\nAnd so it was that he addressed his Cabinet later in the day, thanking them for the work they were putting to bring the unions down. They needed reassurance after seeing them "come to naught" against the AFL-CIO. No matter, he said, there's still everyone else. If not America's biggest union, then the bottom feeders nibbling at the scraps it leaves behind.\n\nHoover got a different message shortly after, in yet another of their "personal conversations" behind closed doors."

Its front page had a still of the Supreme Court immediately after the vote, captioned "SC VOTES 5-4 TO CUT AFL-CIO DOWN" underneath. The President felt his grin grow wider.\n\nSure, the union bastards got away in the end. But they also left behind a waterfall of blood as they shambled away to wherever dark crevasse they'd come from. He took another sip from his mug -- slightly bitter, just the right amount of sweet. He can live with a flavor like that.\n\n"What do you mean, Speed?" the President inquired. "We'll do what we've been doing ever since I made the Oval Office my bedroom."\n\n"The Court didn't do enough. Who's to say they won't get back up again?"

This time he added twice the sugar and thrice the cream to the mug, before pouring boiling water to mix. Hot mocha seemed appropriate for starting a very promising day -- a little treat every now and then never hurt anybody.\n\nHe had every reason to treat himself, really. If bringing down the fattest socialist hydra in America didn't at least deserve a sugar rush on his part, then why bother celebrating anything at all?\n\nLast night's celebrations still struck vivid images in his mind. Good cheers rang throughout the White House as rich vintages, reserved only for special occasions, flowed the length of its hallways like life-giving rivers. His staff unstuck themselves from that one moment of disbelief upon hearing the decision by hugging and kissing each other as if Christmas Eve and New Years put together had come. He joined in of course. If the kids can have their fun, then so can this old timer with all the stress to burn.\n\nBarry allowed himself a gulp of rich, creamy hot mocha. Of course there'd be fallout; he heard fallout shouting and chanting slogans even from the comfort of his kitchen, sounding like gouts of fire sweeping a crackling inferno across DC. He can start putting fires out after getting prepared for another day in the White House. But for now?\n\nThe President downed the rest of his coffee with one flick of the wrist.

The action was of little surprise for President Goldwater's close council -- his legendary antipathy for "bloated rackets led by the most corrupt of men" was well-known within the Beltway and beyond.

His agents will get away with the dirt without leaving a fingerprint."\n\nSo far, the Director's words ring true. After mere days of planning and observation, a clandestine break-in of an office building evinced the corruption President Goldwater railed against: gifts to fellow union bosses, membership fees "creatively deducted" from annual earnings reports, officers buying twice what they make in a month. The subsequent leak to the media from a "concerned insider" made certain of the union's demise from both public shame and public lawsuits."

None of them bode well for Goldwater.\n\nIt began, according to testimony, when a guard working the night shift in the American Federation of Teachers building at New Jersey Avenue spotted unusual lights coming from one of the fifth floor facade windows. The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office. Drawers gaped open, now emptier without their paper -- but their more valuable effects were left virtually untouched. Cubicle after cubicle of upended folders and undisturbed paper bills. By now the guard was befuddled and confused; just what were the thieves looking for?\n\nAfter switching the lights on, however, he then noticed gold glimmering half-beneath the sea of crisp, white letter paper. Brushing aside the sheafs, he picked it up.\n\nThus, at 1:13 in the early morning, the Metropolitan Police Department woke up to a security guard with an FBI badge held by a shaky vice grip. Thirty minutes later, every news station in the country woke up to an MPD statement that said FBI agents unlawfully entered the AFL compound at midnight.

After all his valiant effort towards detente with the Americans, this new president was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office.

Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra.

German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n"The Americans aren't taking us seriously." He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. "They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously."\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. "Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them."\n\nThere was silence at the table. "Pardon, my Führer?" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. "We can arrange a meeting. In neutral territory; perhaps Switzerland? I am willing to speak to them there."

 GLD.Speer.4.t:0 "Speer Proposes Face to Face Meeting"
 GLD.Speer.4.desc:0 ""You're serious? The Führer's actually proposing that I meet him one on one?"\n\n"I scarcely believed it myself, Mr. President. But the offer is genuine. I spoke directly with Mr. Speer on the phone, and he is insistent that he is willing to personally negotiate this."\n\nAcross the desk from McNamarra, President Goldwater sat back in his chair. This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country."\n\n"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet."\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called "master race" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."

 GLD.Speer.5.desc:0 "Schmidt was somber as he spoke. "I'm afraid it's not going to happen, my Führer. The American Foreign Minister was quite adamant, their President has no interest in speaking with us."\n\nSpeer did not speak for a moment. He had expected this, of course, but it was nonetheless disappointing. And humiliating. "I understand. Thank you for letting me know, Schmidt. You can leave now." Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world. Germany would have to pull itself from the ashes without reliance on America or any other nation, just as it had done once before."

"The American President, my Führer! He agreed to the meeting. He is on his way to Geneva as we speak."\n\nSpeer slowly put down his pen and stared at Schmidt in disbelief. His long shot plan had worked. A moment passed as Speer collected his racing thoughts. Finally he stood, almost too quickly, and motioned for Schmidt to follow him as he marched from the office. "Cancel my appointments for the week," he instructed his secretary as he passed, "and have someone pack my travel essentials."\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt. "We have much to prepare. This meeting is crucial for the future of our relations and for Germany's place in the world. Goldwater will almost certainly be playing from a position of strength and, well, I must confess I am no diplomat.\n\nSchmidt struggled to keep up. "I understand, my Führer. I will help wherever I can. If you like, I can help you practice the negotiations."\n\n"I would much appreciate that. I will need all the help I can get." Pausing in the hallway, he turned to Schmidt and took him by the arm.\n\n"This is a historic moment. We must not let it go to waste.""

 GLD.Speer.7.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide"
 GLD.Speer.7.desc:0 "Packing, preparing and flying out to Geneva took less than two days, such was the expediency of the federal branch for such an important occasion. As the plane approached landing, the Secret Service agents aboard began hurriedly running through procedure one more time, and for the first time President Goldwater began to grow nervous. Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet," he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute. Instead, Speer stepped forwards with a slight smile, reached out his hand and greeted him, in English.\n\n"Good afternoon to you, Mr. Goldwater.""

 GLD.Speer.8.desc:0 "The American President Goldwater had arrived at the hotel shortly before Speer himself. Speer had debated what to do upon meeting him, considering a quick salute and a bow of acknowledgement, but Schmidt had argued that a simple handshake and a greeting in English would be more diplomatic. And so the two had shaken hands, being immortalized in an image likely by now already circling through the world's media. The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. "How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?" asked Speer.\n\n"Pleasant," replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. "I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?"\n\n"Indeed, indeed." As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."

The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Goering to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world." Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."

The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany."\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."

He could already picture the headlines, the documentaries, the inevitable historical significance of -\n\nSpeer laughed. Not a laugh of nervousness or fear, but of amusement. Speer began speaking, his brow cocked slightly as he spoke, and Goldwater found himself suddenly on edge as he awaited the translation.\n\n"You are clearly committed to your ideals of democracy, Mr. Goldwater. Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please."\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree? Attempting to keep his cool, Goldwater began to consider conceding Speer's point. Or perhaps, to prevent further unfortunate lines of questioning, he should end the session here."

What I would instead propose is that you leave your allied nations out of it. The rest of your Organisation of Free Nations should be permitted to trade with Germany if they so wish."\n\nAs Speer's translator finished relaying his words, Goldwater immediately scowled. "Is this why you brought me here today? So that you could propose sidestepping my authority and slipping into the western markets through the backdoor?" He leaned forwards before Speer had a chance to speak up. "Listen to me, Mr. Speer. I vowed to my people that I would shut fascism out of the Organisation of Free Nations. I must emphasise - Free nations, Mr. Speer. As long as your people continue to goosestep their way into the darkness, I will uphold that vow."\n\nSpeer stuttered as he tried to respond.

Do you insult me as an American? Or perhaps you refer to the fact that my father was a Jew? Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Speer?" As the Führer stumbled for words, the President scoffed. "I can't believe I agreed to come here. You are no different to your beloved Hitler. Good day, Mr. Speer." With nary another word, he turned and stormed bitterly from the room."

While the specifics of the agreement would still need to be formally ratified, the embargo would soon be significantly loosened and trade would flow once again between the OFN and the Unity-Pakt. Goldwater wondered how exactly congress and the voters would respond to this development, and even as they began to depart he wondered if it was too late to back out. \n\nAs the President and the Führer stood in the hotel foyer, Speer turned to Goldwater and offered a handshake for the second and final time. "This was a productive meeting, Mr. Goldwater. I look forward to future dialogue with the United States".\n\nGoldwater paused as he returned the handshake. Shaking hands with a man whose country would consider someone of Jewish blood like himself as less than human still felt troubling. "This was more... diplomatic than I was expecting. Thank you for your time". With that, the two men departed the hotel for their respective return trips.\n\nGoldwater had a lot of time to think as his flight made its journey back to America. What would he say to the press? How would the party respond to his unexpected u-turn? What was his own take away from all of this? This had certainly not been the trip he had anticipated, and he was unsure if he would ever feel completely at ease about it. It was all making his head spin.

That Goldwater, a man who had taken power on a platform of anti-fascist opposition and anti-German sentiment, had been convinced of the error of his ways was a great victory for the Reich - and for world trade as a whole.\n\nAs he returned to Germania, he was first greeted by Schmidt. "An excellent display, my Führer!" said Schmidt as he pushed a copy of the morning paper into his hands. The headline celebrated Germany's diplomatic coup, hailing Speer's overpowering of the USA's decision. It was a little embellished, as all German media tended to be, but Speer supposed it would do.\n\nAs he returned to his duties as Führer, Speer felt satisfied that he had proven his worth and demonstrated his new path for Germany.

The ceaseless messages from the major conglomerates lamenting their lost foreign assets left him gloomier still. He had failed. A man in his position could not afford failure. Weakness in the face of the tasks that still lay ahead for Germany was unacceptable.\n\nSitting at his desk, he considered where Germany might go from here. A relief package to dampen the woes of affected businesses was a given. A meeting with the economic bigwigs to determine alternate trade partners would also be essential.

It was a wasted journey, but at least he had made Speer look like a fool.\n\nWhen Goldwater arrived back in America, he found himself quickly swept before the journalists, all eager to hear his account of things. He smiled for the cameras, and waited for the hubbub to die down before speaking.\n\n"Mr. Speer is no different to his predecessor, nor any of those who tried to claim Germany in the past. He believes that his country deserves all the bounty of the free world without being a part of that free world. I tried to be reasonable, and I decided to hear him out in the interests of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, it is clear that even under its new ruler, the ego of the German nation knows no bounds.\n\n"Let this be a lesson to all those who rule with an iron fist. If you are willing to extend liberty, then liberty will extend its bounty unto you. If not, then the bounty shall forever be denied."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a smile as he returned to the White House.

It's not right, it's not American, and President Goldwater is on the case!

We fought for American liberty, for the very American Dream which earned us our independence; however, now all we can find is the sorrow of defeat within the Presidency, and a lesser and lesser chance at reelection as thoughts towards the future echo throughout the President's mind..."

Whilst the Supreme Court did not fully obliterate the AFL-CIO, it did manage to create several impositions against the powers of the Unions and how much they can hamper large American businesses.

Finally, we shall undo the curses of corruption upon the American market that the extremely bloated and overzealous union organizations brought upon it, and bring about a new era of shiny, golden prosperity for all the hardworking American patriots throughout the country!"
