USA.1701.t:0 "The Giant Awakens"
USA.1701.d:0 ""My fellow Americans, I stand before you today, having taken the oath of office that our forefathers have taken for nearly two centuries. Within many of our lifetimes, we will live to see a third millennium. Before the celebrations of such milestones, it is important to reflect on how our nation is, and how it shall be. I swear to you America: we will be a greater nation upon these celebrations."\n\n"America, for decades, our government has been plagued by inefficiency: wasteful, expensive, and otherwise useless programs that have weighed down the true strength of our nation. For many years, this incompetence was not so important, for the nation was strong and her enemies were few. Now, however, when we are constantly standing upon the precipice of conflict with foreign powers, such programs cannot be afforded. America must stand strong, undivided, and without frivolous distraction, if we are to outlast our enemies."\n\n"Beyond pure survival, though, let us rejoice that, should our almighty God give us strength, I believe we shall rise unto a new age of American prosperity. Taxes and the infernally wasteful IRS shall be streamlined, hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created, and near-every American shall be able to purchase a home and live in peace. You may hear these and believe them to be lofty goals, but I say they are quite achievable. All we need do is trim the fat from our government, and work as one united people.""

USA_bob_72_workwiththeparty_desc:0 "Since we won the election as a Republican-Democrat, it's only reasonable, prudent even, that we should be working within our coalition. First on the agenda is giving the military the resources it needs in order to improve itself. While we can always find more ways to cut inefficiencies and waste, sometimes more money for more training, more recruits, more planes and more boats is necessary. Then, once we have the muscle to flex, we can take an even stronger line against the Germans, who only respond to force. Well by God, we will have force!"

Now we are using the cold, hard facts to maximize everything, especially when it comes to defense. The best place to station aircraft carriers. The most effective use of flybys to intimidate. The best training methods to ensure the minimization of American casualties and the maximization of our enemies. And, if necessary, the loopholes and grey areas of the current laws that we can use to our advantage.\n\nGet a pot of coffee on, it's going to be a long night."

The President has been working with senators from both parties on a sweeping bill to provide billions more to the military, to fund everything from new weapon systems, upgrading technology to become more capable, and investing in bettering the lives of our men in arms. But the largest aspect of the bill is to give the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency the leeway and funds to not only surpass the Germans and Japanese right now, but right into the next century. We will make America not only the strongest nation in the world militarily, but also the most forward thinking and advanced!"

USA_bob_72_appeasetherepublicans_desc:0 "While the Democrats may be on the upswing now that McNamara is in office, that doesn't mean that we can ignore the Republicans and their needs and desires entirely. In fact, that would make running the government that much harder and frictious, and that's the last thing the new President wants. Vice President Bayh has already an idea in mind to work with the GOP: the University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act. Ever since the federal government started giving grants to universities to help develop new technology, the debate over who actually owns the intellectual rights to the new developments has been a fraught one. This new bill will streamline it by giving the universities the chance to patent and profit off these inventions, since they did all the hard work. And the President is all for giving those that work hard on ideas and technologies to improve America's security and standard of living the right to prosper thanks to them."

Quiet and shy, he has a knack for details and can see many sides of the same issue, coming to the best conclusion after long thought. This is exactly the kind of man we need to oversee the Department of Defense. While Rusk's career so far has been in the State Department, President McNamara trusts him to negotiate the rivalries of the different branches of the military to work together to dual goals of defending America, and defending freedom.\n\nThe only opposition we have faced regarding Rusk's confirmation are from uber-pacifist Republicans like Senator McGovern, but they are the very, very small minority. Then again, they wouldn't like anyone to be sitting in the Pentagon unless they were a Hippie."
USA_bob_72_themcnamarapresidency:0 "The McNamara Presidency"
USA_bob_72_themcnamarapresidency_desc:0 "Robert McNamara is not who anyone would consider a charismatic politician. He's a numbers guy, having studied economics at the University of California, Berkeley and got an M.B.A. at Harvard before the war, and then serving in the Army Air Corps. He wasn't a pilot or front line officer, but conducted statistical analysis of bombers effectiveness, even as the Japanese pushed the Americans across the Pacific. After the war, and a stint in the upper levels of management at the Ford Motor Company, McNamara joined government service, working in the Department of Defense under multiple administrations, doing his best to make the US military the most efficient and effective in the world.\n\nNow, having experience in both the private sector, and turned the military into a finely honed machine ready to stand up to the Reich and the Rising Sun, he's ready to bring that experience to the nation as a whole. With the young and popular Birch Bayh as his Vice President handling the more public events, McNamara can do what he does best: crunch the numbers, find efficiencies, and turn the American government into a finely honed machine."

USA_bob_72_fillingthegovernment_desc:0 "The first call the new President is making is to George Shultz, a successful businessman who had served in several government roles over the previous decades, including on Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors, Secretary of Labor under Nixon, and an economic policy commentator and advisor over the years. This time, Schultz will be given the Treasury Department to run, so he will have some real power to go with his suggestions and plans. He also has strong opinions on foreign policy of the anti-fascist variety, which should make getting any budget increases we propose in the future to run through the bureaucracy that much smoother."
USA_bob_72_timetocleanhouse:0 "Time To Clean House"
USA_bob_72_timetocleanhouse_desc:0 "One of the problems with the old style of politics was that loyalty to the party and deference to ideology was the most important aspect of governing the nation, even if it didn't actually help America in the long term. President McNamara doesn't believe this: it's inefficient, values subservience to party more than competency in a subject, and leads to infighting and corruption. The best way, the only way, to run the country is to get the best people in the right positions, no matter their political leaning. The Republicans and Democrats may moan and complain as their candidates are shunted aside for non-political, or worse, NPP members, but it's all for the good of America. Nation over Party."

USA_bob_72_rallythedemocrats_desc:0 "The President is not a public speaker. McNamara is a numbers guy, and you can't convince stats with powerful words, nor can you change mathematical facts with soaring rhetoric. His words will never enter the pantheon of great American speeches like Washington, Lincoln or Kennedy. But when he does have something to say, and something that he can't simply hand to Bayh to do, it has to be important. And uniting the Democrats, to ensure they are all on the same page to support his administration, is just one such effort. While the speech he is giving to the Democrats invited to the East Room is full of cliches ("the best is yet to come!") and a couple awkward turns of phrase ("It won't be easy, it will be hard, it may even be difficult"), there is no doubt of the sincerity behind it, and his ideological allies are all the more supportive that he at least made the effort."

Now that the groundwork has been laid, it's time to make official the new McNamara Doctrine. It will not be simply an address to the nation like previous Presidents have done to outline their foreign policy, but it will become ironclad law. We will use our democratic institutions to show to America's enemies what they will soon be facing.\n\nI'd be quivering in my jackboots already!"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids:0 "Call Up The Whiz Kids"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids_desc:0 "In his time serving in the Nixon Administration, Robert McNamara had developed professional relationships, even friendships, with a variety of young, talented and incredibly smart men that soon became known as the "Whiz Kids" within the Federal Government. While they didn't have the top roles in government twelve years ago, working as Under-Secretaries or backroom specialists and analysts, now they are more than qualified to implement modern management systems into the government, focusing on the fields of economic analysis, operations research, game theory, and computing.\n\nAdam Yarmolinsky, William Kaufmann, and Charles Rossotti are just a few of the business executives and intellectuals that will be given high roles in the government, to bring a modern sensibility to the tired mechanics of government. The old timers and civil servants that rely more on patronage and not causing waves may not be too thrilled to be working under these new and radical ideas, but it's the President's decision, not theirs. So they better adapt or get out of the way."

While, yes, the R-D's developed a campaign platform on internal affairs, McNamara is going to leave that quagmire up to Vice President Bayh and Congress to sort out. No, he's focused on the big picture, the whole world.\n\nThe only other people in Washington that cares as much about foreign policy as McNamara does is the National Progressive Party, who are as committed to anti-Fascism as he is. It may be heretical to the President's party, and may require having to agree to slashing welfare, or unsustainably increasing it to get one wing or another onside with his foreign policy, but that's for everyone else to worry about. As long as America is united in defense of democracy and freedom abroad, who cares?"

While they may not agree on much else politically, McNamara is willing to overlook that, to provide bipartisan support to his agenda. The Republicans may not like it, since they aren't going to get one of their guys to be the head of the Pentagon, but it will play well to the rest of the nation. The charts and polls show that."

Schultz marveled at how McNamara could recall the precise details of someone else's work, all these years later.

Even now, as the boss of all America and with his own captive audience, he saw no reason for that to change.\n\n"During the election, I said that America was in to win the Cold War, not to outlast the Germans and the Japanese.

"I want your honest opinion: can this be done?"\n\n"It's not a matter of can - it's a matter of necessity, Mr. President." Rusk didn't bat an eye before responding. "So many Beltway insiders say that nuclear weapons have made major power war obsolete, Mr. President. But in my experience, the road to fighting facism starts well before that point. It will be in the steppes of Manchuria, the South African veldt, the jungles of Indonesia."\n\nRusk leaned forward.

Here was the President of the United States, offering a leader in the opposition a blank check. A nagging voice in Jackson's head whispered that he'd inevitably tie his name to whatever the President had planned - and that if things went wrong, he'd be going down on McNamara's ship.\n\nMaybe that wasn't so bad, if they both believed in the same things. American primacy abroad - and if, in exchange, the President was willing to assure prosperity at home, then wasn't he getting the better end of the deal?\n\nThe next morning, Washington - and R-D party headquarters, in particular - received the news of Henry Jackson's nomination to serve as President McNamara's Secretary of Defense with a single, resounding cry:"

BOB.13.desc.a:0 "After a prolonged debate in the Senate, the [GetYear] Military Readiness Act has passed in a floor vote and is now headed to President McNamara's desk to be signed into law.\n\nThe first major piece of legislation aimed at fulfilling the President's stated goal to revamp the American military for a decisive victory in the Cold War, the bill embraces a sweeping retooling of the armed forces along the principles of modern operational research methods. The Administration's approach to military affairs is suffused with statistical analyses and quantitative methods from the heights of grand strategy to the nuts and bolts of equipment procurement, envisioning an expansive force perfectly tailored for the battlefield of the future.\n\nObjections to the bill on the Senate floor were predominantly focused on the cost of President McNamara's military programs, with a force both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to its enemies being prohibitively expensive to field. Administration officials dismissed these concerns, noting that the American people had elected the President with a mandate to ensure American victory in the Cold War, and that the Administration would employ its same statistical methods to ensure cost-effectiveness in the pursuit of military superiority."

Not only was it the brainchild of an unprecedented bipartisan effort - uniting President McNamara's brain trust of advisors with the most hawkish elements within the National Progressive Party - it's DOM provision (Deployment, Overseas Military) authorizes the 'limited' deployment of American military units overseas, at the President's discretion.\n\nThe bill has had the unusual effect of uniting dovish segments of the NPP with constitutionalists within the R-D's in opposition to the bill, concerned that the FREE Act and the DOM provision would erode Congress' power to declare and oversee foreign conflicts in the pursuit of military adventurism overseas. The McNamara Administration's backers have responded that, nearly a decade after the German Civil War and the Japanese economic crash, America will need to be able to respond quick and decisively to new developments in order to secure its advantage in the Cold War."

Social democrats within the NPP and fiscal hawks within the R-D's waged a successful campaign arguing against waste within the government and questioning the need to spend so much money on overseas military adventures even as the Oil Crisis continues to roil the domestic economy.\n\nAdministration officials put a brave face following the defeat, vowing that the President remained 'determined to secure American interests worldwide with the resources available.' Even so, the defeat of the Administration's first important piece of policy legislation raises troubling concerns over the appeal of the President's agenda to secure American influence abroad over prosperity at home."

The bill's stated rationale to 'clarify and streamline the President's powers to conduct foreign and defense policy' - and its 'Deployment, Overseas Military' (DOM) provision, authorizing limited overseas military deployments at the President's discretion - provoked heated opposition from doves within the NPP and constitutionalists within the R-Ds.\n\nThe floor debate continued for hours, and eventually the opposition's argument that the FREE-DOM Act would gut Congress' constitutional role in declaring and prosecuting armed conflicts gained the upper hand, with the bill's backers failing to mount a spirited defense in the final hours of debate. The Administration - and the bill's backers in the NPP - refused to comment after the vote, and political analysts expect a prolonged period of internal party wrangling within both the R-D's and the NPP."

Compounding this issue is the fact that such laws differ from country to country; keeping track of them all without a universal standard stifles, and has stifled, trade beyond reason.\n\nTherefore, President Bennett, keen on reforming yet another facet of the largest alliance of democracies on Earth, plans on dismantling some of these barriers by proposing unified immigration and tariff standards for the OFN.

This allows them growth matching our own economy's, and their respective nations some surety over how much their own money is worth. It is a risky proposal, and one which no doubt treads all sorts of sovereignty issues -- but much like the rising tide lifts all boats, so too shall the world's greatest economy shoulder the burden of lifting the Free World to a starry-eyed future."

For the OFN, however... well, it's why the President has announced a conference to be held at a quaint hotel complex in beautiful New Hampshire.

Free markets have paved the path to enlightenment once, and so shall it pave the path to the future.\n\nAs the champion of freedom, America has the unspoken obligation to encourage free markets wherever and whenever possible.

Not everyone has the wherewithal or the luxury to set aside funds for when the yearly budget inevitably comes short, or for when acts of God cause untold millions of dollars in damage. Without a reliable lender to guarantee them safe loans for to restore or accelerate economic growth, these nations' capabilities to recover from tumultuous circumstances will remain weak and insufficient.\n\nEnter the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank: Two multinational institutions, backed by American economic might, willing and able to offer these very loans to all OFN member states.

Astute observers would point out this facet of American lawmaking's mind-bogglingly byzantine nature... but for the Beltway's savvy participants, the tedium this presents is a beloved tool to keep the laws they dislike from ever seeing the light of Capitol Hill.\n\nPresident Bennett is aware of the many ways his opponents can utilize this fearsome bureaucratic bludgeon to undermine the passage of his own Civil Rights Act, and plans to make appeals of support to his fellow Republican-Democrats in the appropriate committees."

This will require some deals to be cut with various factions and interest groups within Congress to get some of the more wavering folks on board, but as long as we promise to push a few of their personal causes forwards a bit it shouldn't be difficult to garner their votes.

The point is, we have several bills lined up that should hopefully get most of America on the same page.

Capital and goodwill wasted on exchanging old allies for new and controversial stances is capital and goodwill not spent on curtailing America's rampant inflation, or on containing fascism's metastasis in the world's last unblemished patches.\n\nBut neither can he afford to be seen by the public as ignoring the issue wholesale.

Besides, we've made broad-spectrum politics work far better than the NPP and their constant bickering amongst themselves.

Though progressives have come to respect us for our acceptance of their concerns, most are likely to continue voting for either the Republicans or the Center-NPP, parties more recognizably aligned with their values.

With progressive values beginning to win out across both the Republicans and the Democrats, it would make little sense to oppose this new bill, which would cement our support with the civil rights movement.

At home, the American people now exercise their freedoms under a safe and stable system managed by capable men.

Bennett let out a chuckle as he leaned back against the most prestigious office chair in Washington, D.C. His feet laid atop the Resolute Desk, legs now free to shuffle about a desk void of drafts and memos for the first time in eight years. America can fight its causes without him... but with him, he can deservedly say, it has gained the disposition and the means to fight on for many decades yet.\n\nNot bad for a Mormon office clerk, all things considered."

WFB.2.desc:0 "If one were to think of an ideal candidate for Secretary of State, Edmund Muskie... wouldn't be it.  He's reserved, blunt, and relatively inexperienced in foreign affairs.  But with all that said, Muskie has a lot going for him.  If Treasury Secretary Robertson is a reward to President Bennett's conservative backers, Secretary of State Muskie is an olive branch to the liberal wing of the Republican-Democrats.  As Maine's governor, and, subsequently, senator, he's championed civil rights and environmental protections, bringing Maine fully into the 20th century.  Depending on who you ask, he's either the right man to represent America on the world stage, or a lily-livered provincial who's better off sending pork back to Portland.  As one editor wryly put it: "Sending Muskie against the Germans would be like sending a three-toed sloth out to seize turf from a wolverine."\n\n"

WFB.3.t:0 "Appointment of Absalom Robertson"
WFB.3.desc:0 ""Absalom, Absalom!" reads more than one witty editorial headline.  With the nomination of Absalom Robertson to the post of Treasury Secretary, the reference to Dixie literature is adroit, but Robertson himself is a serious man.  A scion of Virginia's powerful Byrd Organization, Robertson belongs firmly in the camp of conservative Southern Democrats, adamantly opposed to any sort of integration.  His appointment is surely a sop to President Bennett's supporters in Congress.  But it also has many in the opposition worried.  The Treasury Department has a great deal of power over taxes and audits.  What might it do to those who come out against Bennett's agenda, especially with an arch-conservative in the driver's seat?  And then there's that new production company that his son, Pat, is setting up...\n\n"

Sure, he made his name as Harvard's youngest professor, and helped save Ford from its postwar fiscal chaos.  But McNamara has his fair share of ideology.  In contrast to those who call for the razing of Japan or German Africa, he wants the Pentagon to take a more measured approach.  Fewer first-strike capabilities, and more deterrence.  Fewer rigid doctrines, and more counterinsurgency.  To his supporters in Congress, McNamara is a man who will shake things up, rationalizing the business of war in a new era of conflict.  The question remains, though: will he truly change the Pentagon, or will his efforts get bogged down in the old system?\n\n"

By halting the production of a number of denominations, the hope is that the decline in silver reserves will begin to stabilize.  After all, we can't afford to be profligate at times like this!\n\n"

First, he had been shown some of the hard-working men and women (well, one woman, anyway) who designed anti-counterfeiting markers.  His bureaucrat guides then showed off the vast quantities of ink, paper, and machinery that, when combined, created one of the world's most important currencies.

#WFB.100.desc:0 "In an eventuality that many senior leaders of the coalition hoped would never be reached, we have now had to confront the quagmire that is Civil Rights and the institution of segregation in certain states. Since the inception of Republican and Democratic cooperation, politicians on both sides have been completely unable to find any unity on the issue and, so far, a solution that is pleasing to both sides has eluded us.\n\nNonetheless, the time has come to adopt a federal position in the Civil Rights debate. The Democratic wing of the coalition has sided with pro-segregation southern states, citing states' rights as an argument to allow for the preservation of the system. This has led to intense conflict with the Republican wing, which sees the enforcement of civil rights as necessary to securing freedom for all Americans. Still others have taken a middle-of-the-road stance and advocated for compromise wherever possible to prevent the complete separation of both parties.\n\nDepending on the route we take for this issue, there can and will be severe consequences to the unity of the party. Regardless of the outcome, far-right and far-left factions of the National Progressive Party will inevitably use the ordeal as a power play to gain votes from disillusioned politicians. A middle-ground stance may also lead to dissatisfaction on both sides of the divide. Either way, President Bennett will need to choose a stance on the issue so that Congress members can be rallied to determine the direction of the nation." #duplicate loc key

They are notoriously stubborn, and now that particular characteristic is shining through. Several Dixiecrat senators have threatened to filibuster the upcoming bill pushed by the Bennett administration, including Strom Thurmond, NPP senator from South Carolina, generally considered to be the current head of the Southern Caucus.

The generally old and white Southern Democrat caucus has existed in some form since before the Civil War, though now most vote NPP. They are notoriously stubborn, and now that particular characteristic is shining through. \n\nSeveral Dixiecrat senators have threatened to filibuster the upcoming bill pushed by the Bennett administration, including Strom Thurmond, NPP senator from South Carolina, generally considered to be the current head of the Southern Caucus.

This comes as welcome news to the largely R-D Congress, who are confident that any attempt that the Anti-Civil Rights movement makes to stop the bill from passing will fail.

A formal federal inquiry into long standing complaints found literacy tests that were functionally impossible to pass and the widespread use of poll taxes. These tests were disproportionately given to African American voters, and had an astronomical failure rate. \n\nConsequently, an official investigation into Southern voting stations and practices, as well as into what voter verification measures are and are not permitted, is beginning to take shape. President Bennett has called the measures 'diabolical' and 'antithetical to democracy', and the support for anti-Civil Rights politicians has dropped slightly, but notably."

Many Southern congressmen, regardless of prior affiliation, seem to be voting as one with the Dixiecrats on Civil Rights issues. As things stand currently, Bennett's Civil Rights bill would be narrowly defeated in Congress. \n\nConsequently, both the R-D House and Senate whips have been working round the clock to bribe, bully, blackmail, or otherwise coerce the more conservative elements of the party into voting for Bennett's bill. This situation is particularly worrying, as it is becoming more and more apparent that some compromises may need to be made with the Dixiecrats if any Civil Rights legislation is to be passed."

Influential figures in the party, such as Michael Harrington, found the bill fell short of true social equality, and believed that, were it passed, there would be no more political will for further Civil Rights legislation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, many fence-sitting, old-fashioned Democrats feared that the bill was perhaps too ambitious. Balancing these two groups proved to be an immense challenge; the bill would not pass without their support. Despite some setbacks, the President and Senator Lyndon Johnson were able to convince them to throw their lot in with the bill.\n\nNo official announcement regarding the alliance has been made, and likely never will. Word spreads fast of changing loyalties, however, and the lips of politics are the loosest in existence. No doubt Strom Thurmond and his Dixiecrat caucus already know of the success of Bennett's gamble, and it no doubt terrifies them."

It includes comprehensive protections for voting rights, forbidding state-mandated "literacy tests" targeted at African Americans. It also includes timetables for the total desegregation of American society, demanding that all Jim Crow laws and other race-based legislation be repealed within four months. Most importantly, however, it forbids the discrimination of employment on race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\nMany are surprised that such an all-encompassing, liberal Civil Rights bill was even passed in the first place. In the weeks leading up to the voting on the bill, there was quite a scramble in the R-D's, as President Bennett and his allies struggled to gather the votes. In the end, however, it appears the President was able to get the bill passed, with no compromises on the rights and freedoms of minorities."

The bill, while less comprehensive than some might have hoped, is still one of the largest steps towards total equality between Americans since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. The bill includes federal protections for voting rights, prohibiting "literacy tests" and other such fraudulent measures at the state level intended to disenfranchise minorities from voting. It also includes the prohibition of discriminatory employment based on race, color, religion, etc.\n\nMany more liberal-minded citizens are dissatisfied with how the bill has turned out, however. The bill was originally much more liberal and comprehensive, with far greater protection of the rights of minorities. Due to the need to compromise with Conservative politicians in Washington, several of these protections were loosened or simply removed entirely. Despite this, the majority of people across the nation are simply pleased that any Civil Rights legislation was passed at all."

All provisions for voting protection against minority disenfranchisement have been removed, and only moderate prohibition of discriminatory employment practices. In addition, greatly encompassing exceptions have been added to the bill, dictating that in certain circumstances, minority protections need not be enforced.\n\nOverall, the bill has drawn a vast amount of criticism from the more liberal-minded politicians in Washington, with many deeming it ineffectual. While conservatives across the country are pleased with the outcome, Bennett's Civil Rights legislation is quickly proving unpopular with the general public."

The overt support of the Dixiecrats means the Civil Rights bill appears less genuine to the public, and thus Bennett appears less concerned with the people, and more with getting what he wants.\n\nIn a recent press conference, when questioned over this turn of events and whether or not his administration is becoming more conservative, the President had this to say: \n\n"I am still the man I am when I took office. My opinions are my own and have not changed. The Southern voting caucus being pleased with my actions is not a consequence of changing allegiance on my part.

Consequently, should even more conservative action be taken in the future, the Liberals face a serious threat of losing re-election.\n\nUnderstandably, many liberal congressmen are afraid that they may be replaced. In response, they have begun to rally and take a larger role in legislating. In addition, they are quite upset with President Bennett for threatening the fabric of the R-D's as a whole. Should they be faced with voting for another conservative bill, it is unlikely that they will follow the President's lead, instead doing everything in their power to halt its passing."

This lukewarm approval was also communicated by Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, leader of the Republicans, who said that his party will continue to work with the Democrats in their coalition. Overall, this has had a positive effect on the prospective bill, and things are looking up for Bennett and the R-D's in their pursuit of Civil Rights.\n\nThis turn of events was rather unexpected by many third-party observers, as the President's speech, while well worded, did nothing to alleviate the complaints and fears of the Progressives in Congress regarding the Civil Rights bill.

The President continues to call for the progressives to 'restore national brotherhood' and 'follow a path that is acceptable to all Americans.'\n\nSenator [GetRFKOrJackson], leader of the NPP's social democrats, says that his camp is standing firm. Almost all of the C-NPP has turned down Bennett's call for 'unity'. Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, arguably the most influential Republican in congress, followed Kennedy's lead, stating that the bill was an "afront to foundations of the Republican-Democrat coalition". Rallying behind Kennedy and Johnson, many progressives believe that the bill will simply dampen support for Civil Rights legislation among the general public, while doing the bare minimum in actually achieving racial equality.

As of this moment, the votes are close, and it appears that when voting day comes, a select few congressmen will decide the bill's future.\n\nShould the R-D's fail to gather sufficient support, it is likely that they will be forced to cancel the vote and re-draft the bill to be more left-leaning.

It seems that the President has caught himself in a tight spot, in which he cannot pass the bill without the support of both groups, but will lose the support of one by compromising with the other.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the bill is likely to be re-drafted in a much more progressive fashion than before.

For centuries, many regarded African-Americans as commodities to be used and traded, even igniting a conflict which tore our nation asunder." \n\nIt seemed as if the air had been sucked out from the hall.

"Regretfully, we continue to witness injustices, with African-Americans suffering social, political, and economic wrongs at every level of society. While my fellow Democrats and I adhere to tradition and conservatism, this is by no means justification, or approval of, the prejudices faced by African-American citizens today. It is shameful that some continue to stand against the average American based on the color of their skin. The administration will work to end these wrongs, once and for all.""

Now, President Bennett, I happen to consider myself what you'd like to call a 'Southern gentleman,' and it is in that regard that I am, quite frankly, disgusted that you have left our traditions and wills out of the enforcement of the law in this here country.

Of course, monetary resources have been poured into the project to secure the most reliable and efficient system to aid our alliance members' financial status, with President Bennett declaring that the conference will "secure the world economy against the iron grip of Fascism." \n\nBennett has promised the agreement will promote economic prosperity among the OFN's members, allocating resources among one another rather than reaching out to the more nefarious members of the international market. Whispers of the creation of a World Bank circulate widely among those present, in order safeguard each other from financial failures to ensure that exploitation by rival powers does not occur. With such a system in place, the OFN would create a new means to prospering economically. \n\nHowever, the scope of the agreement has led to some apprehension.

These stories were then published in official R-D media, including a particularly sad story a few hours ago: the killing of a black teenager during a race riot in Charleston. The story was slightly altered such that the teen was simply trying to get through the crowd. In actual fact, the police report claims he assaulted a police officer.

To alleviate this issue while still achieving some civil rights for all, the President has devised a plan: to mire the application of the bill in bureaucracy.\n\nA series of committees and subcommittees will be created nationwide to determine how exactly to apply the new legislation in their assigned communities. Their decision will then be reviewed by a higher authority, and then accepted and implemented.\n\nJust today, the first step towards building these committees and bureaucratic systems was taken, with the swearing-in of the first members of the Federal Committee for Civil Rights Implementation. Headed by a bipartisan group of politicians, it will function as the main oversight board for Civil Rights across the nation. President Bennett has called it "a momentous occasion in the history of our country: the first step towards racial equality.""

Pro-civil rights groups have already come out in celebration, emboldened by the president's support in their efforts to advocate 'freedom for all Americans' while more conservative sects have been quick to denounce these 'tyrannical measures.'\n\nSince its creation in the mid-1800s, the Republican party has argued for the rights of African-Americans, and the support of the level-headed and pragmatic Bennett has only encouraged them to pursue this agenda. Firmly believing that the time has come for equality before the law in the United States, Republican politicians have now proposed various laws that would extend political and social equality to all Americans. The proposed Voting Rights Act, which would grant universal suffrage to citizens regardless of race, is the first of many measures to achieve these goals. The passage of these acts will be hotly contested but hopefully assured.\n\nThe effects of this decision on the two-party coalition have yet to be seen, but projections do not look good. Many Southern Dixiecrats feel betrayed by this sudden change of course, and, in the confusion, may be swayed to factions that better represent their constituents.

The effects of this decision will surely be felt for years to come, both in policy and in the makeup of the already-weakened coalition.\n\nSo far, Democrats have taken an entirely conservative stance in the Civil Rights debate, arguing against provisions to outlaw race-based discrimination. Their newfound dominance in Congress will favor the status quo in segregationist states, leaving voting rights and other hotly contested topics to their discretion. How this will affect any previous civil rights legislation is uncertain.\n\nThe uneasy alliance between the liberal and conservative wings of the coalition is now in doubt, as many Republicans have been quick to denounce the party establishment.

The group is splintering over issues of whether or not to pursue further Civil Rights legislation and whether to continue working with the Democrats.

Also included in his speech was a warning to avoid 'political extremes,' stressing that the best solutions come from discussion, not partisan division. While withholding outright endorsement for either course of action, he has also suggested the possibility for compromise, but the form that would take was left unspecified.

What could he or Horton do, if there wasn't enough silver in Washington? \n\nAnd so each week, Horton would walk into the bank branch with fading hope, and walk out with dying dreams. Today would be no different, he was sure, until the manager whisked him into his office. \n\n"Mr. Horton! There's some good news today...""

WFB.Chains.11.t:0 "The Call from Up High"
WFB.Chains.11.desc:0 "On certain days, President Bennett would seclude himself in the Oval Office in the morning with his advisors, planning out his next actions. The quiet work of politics was one best done without distractions. \n\nA knock at the door, followed by an aide peeking into the room. He looked at his feet for a second, then pressed on. "You've got a call, Mr. President. From Salt Lake City, a Mr. Thomas Monson -" \n\n"I'll take it in here, thank you." Bennett had closed the distance in seconds, before closing the door firmly in Elliot's face. A call from a senior leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints most definitely did not need to be advertised by an incautious aide. \n\nThe phone rang, and President Bennett took a breath before picking up. "Mr. Monson. What's the occasion for calling today?" \n\n "Brother Bennett, I wanted to talk to you about the civil rights speech you gave the other day." Monson wasted no time getting to the point. "Don't you think we should give dialogue time to work? Rushing through earthly solutions won't do much to fill the spiritual void between the races." \n\nBennett took a deep breath. Of course the Church had an opinion, but he had his own..."
WFB.Chains.11.a:0 "The country needs civil rights to come from the top."

WFB.Chains.12.t:0 "Equal Before the Law, Equal Before God"
WFB.Chains.12.desc:0 "President Bennett leaned back in his chair as he responded to Thomas Monson's request to 'hold back' on the civil rights question. "Mr. Monson, I have a duty to look after all the people in the United States, and it's clear to me that we can't hold one group of people above another in the eyes of the law. Not anymore; the R-D's won't stand for it, and the people won't stand for it." \n\nBennett looked through the Oval Office windows, out onto the South Lawn. Beyond it was the Ellipse, the park that had played host to protests and counter-protests fighting over the question of civil rights in full view of the White House. A nation tearing itself apart over the Nixon years and the long decade of civil rights turmoil. \n\nHe'd been elected to bring the nation together and to heal, and as Lincoln had said, the nation would not survive half slave and half free. Even in the century following the Civil War, America was still a nation at war in its soul. \n\n"Mr. Monson," Bennett said, "alongside my duties to uphold the Constitution, I am a religious man. And if I am to practice the teachings of Christ, to hold true to the maxim that we are all made equal in God's image, then I cannot bear witness to suffering based solely on the color of a man's skin.""

Thomas Monson did not attempt to hide his displeasure. "I respect that you're a godly man, but I had thought you were more inclined to listen to the elders of the Church on matters of moral import." \n\nBennett remained silent. The dignity of the office of the President demanded no less. \n\n"The Church cannot accept that radical changes are the right path forward." Monson sighed. "The congregation won't accept it, and I can imagine that I will not be the only one disappointed if that is the path your Administration takes.""

The work of leadership is arduous, even when you proceed to do what you know is right. " \n\nBennett remained silent. The dignity of the office of the President demanded no less. \n\n"I know that you have your flock to tend to, as do I." Monson continued. "Very well, Brother Bennett; you've convinced me that the work of civil rights cannot be delayed, and if you go forth with your action, then I will endeavor to make sure that the faithful understand.""

Oh, there were those who would be unsatisfied with the bill, on both sides of the aisle. George Wallace's men in the NPP were giving him the stink-eye, and Lyndon Johnson had been 'cornering' administration aides all morning about Bennett's 'criminally weak' Civil Rights Bill. \n\nBut for now, Washington was quiet, and the country was moving onwards. It's what Bennett had promised, and Bennett had delivered. \n\nWould it be good enough to steer America in the right direction, as a country and as a people, far into the future? Bennett admitted that he didn't know; he wouldn't know, for that America would likely come after he had gone on to meet God. \n\nThe following morning, Bennett found a neatly packaged letter atop the stack of folders that graced the Oval Office desk - from Thomas Monson.

And now that the bill had been passed, with jubilation in the North and teeth-gnashing in the South, how would the West react? \n\nA congregant turned sadly to his neighbor. "I can't believe the President would ignore the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and go forward with the bill. He always seemed like such a good man." \n\n"Maybe he likes the blacks more than God," came the dismissive reply. "How can you claim to be a man of faith if you don't listen to the elders of the Church?" \n\nThe congregation quieted as Elder Thomas Monson took the pulpit, a stormy look on his face. "I ask that our congregation, in these trying times for our nation, look inwards into themselves to find strength, and to pray for the soul of Brother Bennett, who has strayed from the path of the faithful...""

The White House staff, Vice-President Ford amongst them, was huddled around the television, showing Michael Harrington being interviewed by CBS. \n\n"Why didn't you tell me you were talking with Thomas Monson, Mr. President?" Ford whispered. Bennett froze as Harrington launched into his tirade. \n\n"Anyone who's pursued a career in politics - or took civics classes as a kid - knows that the separation of church and state is sacrosanct. Hell, every Kennedy has had to dodge accusations of being a puppet of Rome, and I'm no different, even if I'm a lapsed Catholic!" Harrington stabbed his pencil at the camera. "So why does the Mormon church in Salt Lake City have a direct line to the President of the United States? It'd be embarrassing, if it weren't downright dangerous, especially given Elder Monson's words about the recent Civil Rights Act..." \n\nFord pulled Bennett aside. "I'm not going to question your right to talk to your priest, but I need you to be straight with me now. Did Thomas Monson influence your decisions on the Civil Rights Act, and should we say anything about it?""
WFB.Chains.20.a:0 "I told Monson no; Harrington doesn't have the full story!"

Regarding Mr. Harrington's statement earlier this week, is it true you've been speaking with the elders of the Mormon church about policy?" \n\n"On the question of whether I've been in contact with Mr. Monson: yes, I have." Bennett's frank admission stunned the crowd into silence. "But no, if you're wondering whether Mr. Monson has been an undue influence on the policies of my Administration, he has not." \n\n"But what about the Civil Rights Act?" A reporter, having recovered from the initial shock, blurted out the obvious question. \n\nBennett shrugged. "Well, if you actually read the text, there are many points on which Mr. Monson and I disagree. Mr. Monson's opinions are well known, but we don't see eye to eye on everything just because we share the same faith." \n\nBennett chuckled, as the reporters' pens scribbled furiously.

Already, the North was raising a ruckus about 'Bennett's Jim Crow,' as Michael Harrington had argued a few days earlier. But much of the rest of the country seemed at peace - though he imagined that there would be some restiveness in the South once the Department of Justice sent its people to hold its non-binding consultations with state authorities. America, exhausted after years of turmoil, had seemed ready to put the matter to sleep. \n\n'What does our soothed conscience in Washington mean for the African-American?' President Bennett recalled Robert Kennedy's scathing words in the press, following the Senate vote. He was troubled, of course. In the face of America's most trying political crisis since the Civil War, who wouldn't be afraid that they hadn't done enough? \n\nHe looked at the image of Jesus on the cross. Bennett was a faithful man, and this - this Act was what he could be comfortable with. Never mind Thomas Monson; this was a matter for Bennett alone, a dilemma shared by any man of faith in office. Bennett had been true to himself, and that would have to be enough for America."

WFB.556.desc:0 "Good morning, Senators, I appreciate your diligence in making it out here to work this early. Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss." With the President's words, the Republicans sat down across from the President's desk. "Gentlemen, the anxieties revolving around the Silver Act's upcoming vote could lead to a complete collapse of support. As President, I cannot allow factionalism to tear apart our country at the seams; thus, gentlemen, you have all been chosen to head to Chicago to meet with Harrington in C-NPP territory. If we can't patch up the economy by ourselves, then we'll have to extend our hand out to the inner cities. I know things haven't been the best between the Democrats and the Republicans recently, but let's try to smooth all that over, what do you say, gentlemen?" The Senators nodded and quickly left to meet with Harrington himself.\n\nThe city had been bustling with activity, and after waiting around for traffic, the Senators' driver dropped them off at a bustling office building on the corner of Ninth street. Finally, the men found their seat across from the Missourian politician himself, looking as annoyed as he seemed impatient. "Well come on, we're busy all day trying to fix what Bennett and the Democrats couldn't." he asked. While sorting through papers, "Now, what is it that you all need over here?" "Well, Mr. Harrington, the President is looking to propose a deal with you and all of the C-NPP." one Senator said. For the first time in the conversation, Harrington stopped sifting through papers and turned to look at the man. "You're telling me the leader of the Democrats and our nation itself has decided to strike a deal with us? After all the harassment, he finally wants to take a step down and offer us something? Now, please, let me know what the President could try to offer us after all of what we, and the miners of the United States, have had to bear?" After taking a deep breath, one of the Senators spoke up, "Now, I know things have been rough between you and Bennett, but he's offering a direct promise here. He's worried about passing the Silver Act; so, if you choose to get your branch to favor the bill, President Bennett has offered a clause which would ensure the jobs of silver miners across the United States, along with a firm agreement to allow the R-D's to open up greater communication to the C-NPP." The leader of the C-NPP tapped his fingers across the desk while offering a look of suspicion towards the Republicans. "Tell me, what makes the President so willing to finally work with us?" Harrington said.\n\n"Because to be honest, sir, President Bennett believes that if we don't fix the economy now, no one's going to be able to.""

Three combat veterans, three Southern Democratic Senators, three figures in the Silver Act vote. "Good morning, gentlemen." He said. "Let's face the light here: the Silver Act's vote is creeping up, but the Congress remains polarized, and I fear the worst; so, I'm sending you three down to the Serpent of the South himself, George C. Wallace to guarantee the extra votes. Understood?"\n\nAnd there we were. The room was silent. The three of us were silent. The Governor of Alabama just sat there, quiet, the whole fucking building was just quiet. "Senators, may I ask what you three are doing down here in my office?" he said, as the pouring of whiskey into five separate glasses flowed in front of us. One Senator picked up first, coughing, "Well, sir, the President sent us here to-" "Oh, my apologies, gentlemen, please, the travel must have dried your throats; please, enjoy a drink." He interrupted. "Don't worry, Mr. Governor, I do not drink." I said, shooting me with eyes like daggers. "Now, as I was saying, sir, President Bennett sent us here to discuss the proceedings of the Silver Act coming up, and how we can align our interests for the betterment of the nation." the Senator said. Wallace swiveled his chair to face the man, stating, "Align our interests? Funny little phrase you put together there. Now, what could the President offer that I may want?" The air in the room tightened like a noose around a criminal's throat. "Well, segregation, sir." the younger Senator with the Southern drawl voiced.\n\nWallace turned."So, Bennett's finally ready to ease down on protecting the Afros? Well, you have my attention, gentlemen. Go on." the Governor asked with a wicked smirk and unending stare. "Well," I finally spoke up, "the President would be glad to have your support, as well as the FR-NPP's support of the terms of the Silver Act. In exchange, he'll look into delaying the work towards Civil Rights legislation." The room stood silent, and still as Wallace's face twisted with contemplation. Suddenly, the room exploded with the slamming of the Governor's fist onto the desk, succeeded by a fierce cackling. "Well, gentlemen, you can go tell Bennett that Governor Wallace shall be considering his proposal to rectify relations with the NPP and the Democrats. For now, however." He stopped short, clearing his throat. "A toast, to the people of the United States." I shakily led our side of the toast and downed the liquor before leaving."

President Bennett has organized a celebratory lunch to praise key members of his Administration, along with some special guests from high society, people of honor, and foreign governments. The mood is high as President Bennett prepares to take to the podium and make a speech.\n\n"My fellow Americans, honored guests, members of my Administration. Today, we stand as one America. One Organization of Free Nations. One world. Over the past few years, we have achieved the greatest accomplishments, soared to the highest heights, and have healed the wounds left from this decade's past. The economy is booming, our people enjoy rights like no other, democracies all across the globe know that their way of life is no longer at stake. The Nazi scourge in Germany, and the Imperialist menace in Japan are beginning to know their place. While their empires of dirt and toil collapse, our nations grow and prosper. We stand united! The torch of freedom burns bright!"\n\nRabid applause erupts from the Rose Garden. The jubilant crowd, fired up from words of passion and wisdom, has hope in their eyes. The future to them does not seem so bleak anymore. Thirty years from now, when their generations ask what they did during the great cold war, everyone in attendance can simply and confidently say that "they won.""

They're talking on their phones, moving files, and doing business. For the first time since years of economic downturn, people are buying stocks again. President Bennett has restored the public's confidence in such an investment. With low interest rates, adjusted oversight, and more provisions, a lucrative section of the finance industry has just exploded. New applicants fresh out of college walk through the office doors seemingly every day. And on the other line of their phones and meeting with people who want to invest, business confidence is being revitalized.\n\nDevin hangs up. He never thought after barely getting his degree, he'd be working in a practically brand new industry. He resigned to a middle management position, but was now making his own money and helping other Americans make it too. To his side, a new arrival sits down, carrying a cardboard box of belongings.\n\n"Hey." The two men exchange an awkward handshake. "You've been here a while, right?" Devin nods. The new arrival stutters a bit, as he moves his chair to face Devin. "Are you sure this whole thing is okay? For something so new, it seems to be doing too well..."\n\n Devin nods, and puts a hand on the new arrival's shoulder. "Look, man. I had the same thoughts when I came in, and some other kind fella did the exact same thing to me. The way I see it, we're helping people make money in ways they could never do before.

Michael knows that all too well, being a part of Australia's diplomatic corps. Perhaps, deep down, he was only worried about his 1st son, Gil. If those Yanks send him to die somewhere else, he wouldn't know what to do.\n\nThat is, until the American Ambassador paid a visit to Canberra today. And with him, he brought some very interesting news.\n\n "President Bennett has readjusted his policy dealing with members of the OFN. As of today, we'll be withdrawing some of our own administration and diplomatic staff, and giving more autonomy to the Australian government in terms of who and what they want to proceed with diplomatically."\n\nMichael couldn't believe his ears. After the speech from the ambassador, he turned to the man next to him. "Hey, mate. You really believe what this Yank is saying? They've been up our arse for decades at this point."\n\nThe man nodded. "That Bennett really is doing his best to equalize OFN policy. I may not like the Yanks either, but they're doing their best to finally even the scales. About bloody time, if you ask me."\n\nMichael had a sigh of relief internally. Years of worry, and reform is finally upon us. Even if he still had doubts, the new Administration in Washington was at least trying to not be the hegemon in which the OFN relies on. Much like before, Michael knew with confidence now that his opinion was shared with many Australians."

But his associations with the likes of Donald Regan and his "voodoo economics," and his incendiary anti-fascist views, have made many of those in power uneasy. But it's time to get to work for all of America now.

But that was before, and this is now, when the R-Ds need to present a united front.

Taxes will be flattened, as will monopolies from unions to corporations to the Federal government itself. The free market with proper nurturing can finely adjudicate many problems on its own and, as ever, the people most directly concerned are financially capable without Federal interference. And if not, it could be that the government has enculturated them to be slavish and dependent, and deteriorated their self-efficiency.

As such he will tend to push his party aside if it means they will compromise his aims to back small government conservatism. With this in mind he will meet significant conflict from the liberal wings of his own party (i.e. Nelson Rockefeller) in pushing his ideal of a flattened tax rate, the systematic nullification of LBJ-esque subsidies (agriculture being particularly crucial), defanging overly demanding unions (reexamining the Wagner Act and the like for starters), reinstating voluntarism in union membership, re-delegating the duties of commerce and trade as is fit back to the states, and rifling through all the other laws of finance Congress has made without mind to the 10th amendment's prohibitions on their doing so."

This entails deregulating boxed in corporations, cutting Federal social spending and other endeavors deemed fruitless or the obligation of states rather than the Washington leviathan, and being so fiscally regimented that it becomes patently difficult to accrue debt in the first place.

He has a tendency to romanticize supply side policy without clearly following its actual stated objectives if political expediency presents itself more attractively. Optimistically, referring him back to his boss' unwavering, literalist fealty for the Constitution will make him think twice if needed.

As his dear friend Buckley might advise, if they can simply be persuaded to explore the options with a Goldwater presidency and market, it will be easier to extricate them from thinking government is the soothing balm for all social wounds. Goldwater will make his cuts into welfareism and state apparatuses more gradual in exchange for an easier time pushing his objectives through an already divided Congress.

To Goldwater, a significant reason for perdurable American economic success in the 19th century was the wisdom against adversely impacting the market with artificial government competition; deviating from which is certainly what wrought the cancer that is corporate monopoly upon the world, and shifty union men along with it. Open competition, free trade, and resisting the urge to make the government's teat a congregation of suckling infants who'll take generations to recover their prosperity, even more so their independency thereby will bear their laborious fruits in due time.

More programs mean more tax money thrown in directions that people could have used to make it out better on their own and of course ever higher taxes to exact the funds needed to support such a bloated apparatus.

And since when did the 10th amendment sanction this sort of foolish meddling in agriculture to begin with? Let the chips fall where they may, let farms and farmers live up to their proper potentials, and good riddance to these cumbersome subsidies, suffocating price supports, and counterintuitive production controls.

If it suspends the 10th amendment for any excuse whatsoever in order to permit a government imposition on the country's economy, it is an inherent outgrowth of this affliction. The larger body of Federal aid, social programs, and stimulus pick-me-ups comprise the spiteful organism that primarily embodies said "welfareism". It stunts the people and businesses by making the government a strident economic competitor in the market which drives competition off the rails rather than the government searching for non-competitive foul play as like its delegated responsibilities from the trustbusting 1910's. It worsens the government by giving it a part it does not know how to play with the competency instilled from the consequences of being a private body who must suffer the results it reaps from both successful and failed operations.

No more will the Keynesian doctrine of self-debt be permitted to crawl along the floorboards of the Capitol and White House, debts will be addressed by unfailingly consistent payment plans where possible or go un-incurred in the first place. If the government can't pay it, loans should become a last resort rather than a convenient stepping stone to gratifying the social magicianship of big-headed policy men. If it involves profligately overarching regulation, it should be examined to see how it can be cut down rather than gymnastically complicated into being "workable". The budget should not be a wishlist for fanciful politicians, but rather a well-oiled machine to keep the country running, and that requires a compact unit that meets bare civic necessities instead of drooling over wasteful stimulus packages."

To prevent extremity from outdoing itself, Goldwater and company are pushing a cap to the debt ceiling. However, Goldwater knows from his Senate days that this manner of push may be fatally tainted from its outset. Knowing this, his cabinet is hiding a card deck of various spending stopgaps off the table to enter play in the event that the debt ceiling is allowed to fizz out of the bottle.

The administration will begin an effective immediate lobby push for reduced social programs, moderate prohibitions on Federal loan taking, slashing a chunk from commerce regulations, particularly as levied at farmers, small businesses, and interstate merchants. Special, pricey, and cronyist protections for unions and massive companies: out. More money for defense, civil services, and necessary infrastructure: in.

Needless to say, this entails a comprehensive austerity to reserve the funds for purchasing equipment, arms, and such; not to mention the scrap materials to manufacture them. Public allotments for social programs, subsidies, and commerce enforcements evaporate from their original applications and resurface back in the Defense Department's coffers via executive order and urgently phrased, persuasive communiques to Congress.

Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age. Goldwater in his air force background finds this appealing if a tad wishy-washy in its forcefulness.

The Nazis are already reliant on strained slave labor conditions for their resources, even a good portion of their conscripts. If they can be exhausted thoroughly via good ole fashioned G.I. mass deployments and mass encirclements, they can be driven back, their resolve as well as their personnel depleted and broken. No nation on Earth save Japan could withstand the full blooming mobilization of America's young men against it all at once.

That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile. An encroachingly irreplaceable element for American G.I.'s as it ferries them with facility, speed, and force to each front as battles ever-changing-ly unfold; providing a formidable hailstorm of leaden cover fire whenever needed.

While some economists say that both plans could be risky, even dangerous as the economy is growing so much faster without the limits of gold and silver, and cutting all ties to some of the largest, if undemocratic, powers in the world could cause an economic recession, Goldwater is very intrigued with the proposals, and as a break from the past.

In such a manner does it get zealous servants while only paying them pennies and a pat on the back for their good work.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their spawn the trade unions emulate its progenitor. America's unions get membership dues and oaths of loyalty out of their peons, and nothing to give them but the euphoria of belonging to some "higher cause". A card of pyramids held together by simple gravity. But with one good kick, believes President Goldwater, it might just come crashing down..."

A mob, regardless of ideology, will always rally around men of action and results -- men who have proven their worth in the eyes of their lessers, and who have the means to direct their zeal towards their cause's ends. Equally true, then, is its corollary: That a mob scatters like dust before wind without a leader to guide them.\n\nFor a movement that derives its strength from countless many mobs, an equally countless number of leaders is their direst necessity... and their weakest link. The next step forward has thus revealed itself in the eyes of President Goldwater's vengeful government."

No force seems enough to banish it fully, as if it were a hydra that gains a hundred heads for each severed neck. Why and how socialism has become so is a query that has driven many conservatives to drink and desperate prayer -- even while a red noose tightens around their own necks.\n\nThe President does not wish to give the socialists any further opportunities to oust him from the White House. To that end, Director Hoover shall task his agents to uncover the nature of America's red hydra, and how it gains such widespread appeal with such a God-fearing people as Americans."

Painstaking progress has been made to isolate them from their sources of support -- progress easily undone if newer unions were to spring out like summer pox.

The thinking goes that such elements should be isolated away from where they can do the most harm. Spies and smugglers make up a healthy portion of these registers, although criminals and rabble-rousers form their majorities.\n\nThe converse of this "blacklist" is a register of individuals who have demonstrated deep loyalty to America and its laws.

Incidentally, America's trade unions happen to be among the largest sources of this sweet, sticky fluid, tempting Senators with an ear for the common man with bribes for "the common good".\n\nThus, the Goldwater administration now sets its sights on Senators and their past and present affiliations.

For a price, of course; after all, it is only fair for a man to ask compensation of equal value to his services.\n\nAnd so, with bare-naked bribes conducted behind doors, the reprehensible are shielded against justice's otherwise terrible reproach by a bulwark of pocket-bulging Congressmen.

For public officials, a tally of gifts and donations laid bare before their constituents is just that: An avenue to absolve the faultless from blame and sift out the corrupt from their hallowed ranks.\n\nPresident Goldwater believes the idea has merit, and plans to implement it forthwith.

An undemocratic travesty it may be, but such is as part of life in the Beltway as sunshine and traffic jams. Presidents who fail to take the lobbyists' grip into account become lame ducks after their first hundred days.\n\nPresident Goldwater thinks likewise -- but not to appease them.

This trend had suffered somewhat in President Roosevelt's heyday, but not to the point where environmental legislation can pass through Congress without heavy opposition.\n\nNevertheless, President Goldwater has begun consulting his most trusted advisors regarding the EPA bill's shape.

We have much more than that.\n\nLet the damn fool Republicans and National Progressives call him a tree-hugging hippie as much as they like, but President Goldwater will gladly draw money from the budget to protect more square miles, enrol more of America's natural wonders into the registry of National Parks."

It is through laws and decrees that such hands are kept away from such a precious resource, for as recent memory unfortunately shows, men are happy to corrupt clean water into impure water without the visible hand of government to chastize their foolery.\n\nNow more than ever, President Goldwater believes, the federal government needs such laws before America's fresh waters are polluted fully. He will not find many allies in Congress for this purpose -- the left prefer their handouts uncompromised by nature's laments, whereas the right bleat about yet another of a million supposed federal overreaches -- but the President himself remains undeterred over his commitment to walking life's narrow gate."

These very same books lift Abraham Lincoln up as a paragon of American virtue, at the same time denouncing his heavy handed suppression of American freedoms under the duress of war.\n\nDecades from now, Barry Goldwater will meet their inevitable judgement like the Presidents before him. What Goldwater will their narrative depict? He hoped it would be Goldwater the environmentalist: The ardent champion of the greatest among the American people's shared heritages.

Clothed in blood-stained red parroting the false German prophet's heresies, socialism has left more scars on Uncle Sam and his children than all the world's fascists put together. Like the hydra of myth, socialism grows despite injuries that would kill lesser men, and it will return to our shores again and again until our cities are crushed beneath its crimson feet.\n\nAll American presidents are duty-bound to cull socialism before it grows into a juggernaut.

However they disagree on the means to achieve peace and prosperity for our people, either side's adherents can take comfort in knowing that the other will eventually be swayed to theirs because of the common goal they share.\n\nFascism, on the other hand, deifies unthinking obedience and lionizes the omnipotence of strongmen. Nowhere else can one find an ideology more anathematic to American values than the Reich's slavish adherence to the supremacy of one race over all mankind.

Often these solutions involved the brutal acts his Nazi inspirations conduct, chief among them wanton violence and the persecution of America's sheltered oppressed.\n\nJust as mildly put is President Goldwater's antipathy for a man who would shoot him out of a principled hatred for his father's ancestry. An intern questioned if his personal spite for the beloved fascist had driven the order to ruin him with blackmail from CIA infiltrators; to that, the Arizonan simply answered with a knowing smile and a pithy about cutting a snake's head off before it can slither away."

The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep.

So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance.

Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice.

These biases, so to say, make accepting certain facts an exercise not unlike herding rabid cats.\n\nFacts such as the public's reaction to his last veto. He had expected, and did receive, the well-wishes from good Americans, yes. But overall... well, perhaps the reds held more sway than he thought.\n\nBut no matter.

America's setbacks in bettering its civil rights may be the most notable, so capturing the public's imagination and attention with its violence and rhetoric, but just as aggrieved -- yet given far less attention -- is the dismal state of its education system. Underfunded and overburdened, schools all over the country languished for years as they presided over the lowest graduation rates in decades.\n\nThe wounds may have already been dealt, the President says, but it is not too late to stymie the bleeding and restore the quality education Americans had once enjoyed."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_refunding_american_schools_desc:0 "Whether it was an earnest, yet short-sighted attempt to save money or an attack on notable wellsprings of government opposition, few can argue the repercussions of the Wallace administration budget cuts on education: less skilled people entering the workforce, more dropouts who can't get a job, and an unemployment rate steadily ticking upwards with every quarter. In a few years' time, Wallace had single handedly impeded America's economy from improving for years yet.\n\nThis mistake must be rectified not only for the good of the nation, but also for the good of its citizenry. Effective immediately, the President will restore funding for public schools and educational institutions back to their pre-Wallace levels."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_seperate_schools_arent_equal_desc:0 ""Separate but equal," went the mantra Wallace and his cronies unabashedly uttered in front of the American people when they justified strengthening school segregation laws within and without the South.

Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting. Clearly, separating the equal only furthered existing inequalities -- and the President aims to do away with the concept fully, despite the furor the South will raise."

Cleaning it up will take time, and one can never assuredly say that things will go back to the way they were before his reign of terror. Regardless, the worst of the damage is being unwound inch by gory inch.\n\nFew elsewhere does this show more than in reverting his "reforms" to American education. Streams of money, once dried but now restored, have slaked the thirst of schools longing for new textbooks and classrooms. Teachers and students return to their desks in droves. Like well-oiled gears sprung into motion, the great machine of academia now turns with more rust lost and old smoothness regained with every gyration.

Rather, it is a federation of fifty separate states, linked by the chains of perpetual Union through shared identity, and whose unified direction is decided by the consensus of an assembly of elected statesmen. This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to "improve" states' rights. Put short, a man who wields the federal government like a mallet to force laws into Congress only has states rights as a tangential goal at best. We should best get to work undoing the damage he's dealt to an otherwise noble goal's repute."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_a_rat_in_sheeps_clothing_desc:0 "Never before has "states' rights" been so associated with segregation as it is today. As expected of a simpleton with little in the way of tact, Wallace never once erred from speaking of "restoring the rights of states to choose their destiny" in the same breath as "keeping the equals separate". Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America. It will take time to untangle the mess he had left behind to local laws, but restoring faith in an integral aspect of America's political system is worth any effort."

Only through repeated exercise, and not a little guidance, can a victim perform as well as they used; in some cases, their past performance will forever be lost in the scene of the crime.\n\nRestoring the prestige of states' rights in this nation is no different. With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again. That said, the South will surely look favorably upon someone willing to help their dearest cause at its very nadir."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_dissacoiate_from_wallace_desc:0 "America's liberals and progressives are prone to boasting that they alone have brought about Wallace's disastrous fall from grace, with their protests and riots.

Sure, picket signs and police brutality catch the press's cameras like nothing else -- but what many ignore is the plight of the innocent conservative, who had either did not ask for or had been duped by the duplicity of Alabama's erstwhile favored son.\n\nDecades from now, the next generation will look back at this decade to look for lessons they can apply to their present. America's conservatives will not be found wanting in this regard."
#GOLDWATER'S BILL LOC

 GLD.127.t:0 "Environmental Protection Agency Founded by Executive Order!"
 GLD.127.desc:0 "Despite the administration's best intentions, President Goldwater's desire to see Congress approve the creation of an Environmental Protection Agency have failed. Subsequently, citing the urgency and need to protect the environment from degradation, the president has signed the bill into law through executive order, bypassing both houses of Congress. The administration insists on the legality of the executive order, while citing its necessity in order to ensure America's nature is preserved. Some voices within the republican half of the Republican-Democrats have denounced this move by the administration as authoritarian. Nevertheless, few others have protested at this measure of the administration.\n\nThe bill is a great step forward in environmental legislation. Regardless of his firm belief in laissez-faire, President Barry Goldwater has always had a special appreciation for America's natural beauty, enough that he would see it protected by the federal government. Particularly younger voters seem to agree with and appreciate the president's environmentalist tendencies, making it likely that he is to enjoy a small surge in support among this demographic.\n\nWith the bill, the president's bill has created a new federal agency: the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA will be made responsible for ensuring that all of America's nature will be preserved and not subjected to needless and excessive pollution, through helping develop and enforce environmental regulation in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe president can rest a little easier knowing that America's beauty is preserved for the next generation."

 GLD.2.desc:0 ""It's no secret we have our share of disagreements, Mr. Rockefeller. Press won't stop speculating on how we'll fall out first." The president shifted in his unfamiliar seat. The Oval Office was far more spacious than the one he'd left on Capitol Hill, and was still an unfamiliar space to him. Across from him, Vice President Rockefeller adjusted his glasses and spoke.\n\n"That's what you called me here for, isn't it? To get ahead of any unforeseen issues. I'm sure we won't agree on everything, but every President and Vice President since Eisenhower has needed to deal with that. I can't promise you my support on everything, but I can keep silent on matters that are less offensive to the Republican Party. Such as your opinion on the unions."\n\n"The unions have nothing to fear from me, as long as they stay in touch with what's good for the nation and not just themselves. But let's start with what we can agree on. The parks bill, and the agency I've proposed to deal with environmental issues-"\n\n"You'll have my full support. Now, about the cabinet- most of these choices, Curtis is a fine statesman, and McNamara is certainly qualified enough for the job. But Regan- Regan concerns me. His policies-"\n\n"What changes would you make to this list, Mr. Rockefeller?"\n\n"Excuse me?"\n\n"Regan is non-negotiable. He's critical for securing electoral support from certain special interest groups and frankly I'm inclined to agree with his view of government's role. I'm asking if there's any changes you want. Katzenbach for Attorney General? Give Udall a position? I've worked with him before, I could do it again."\n\nGoldwater handed the folder of lists to the vice president.

It was just days after the election, and while the White House was still occupied for a few months yet, it was time to prepare the transition.\n\n"Of course, Mr. President."\n\nGoldwater stifled a sigh. There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Party, while Rockefeller was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the R-D's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Rockefeller to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Rockefeller, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nOf course, Goldwater would never come out to say such a thing publically, even if it was true.\n\n"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. I just wanted to let you know who I'm planning on," Goldwater said, handing over a piece of paper with some scrawled handwriting on it."\n\nRockefeller adjusted his glasses as he sat on the sofa, looking over the names. As he got further and further down the list, his frown got deeper and deeper.\n\n"These are all Democrats," Rockefeller said. "I don't see a single Republican, or, rather, anyone that isn't a conservative, Mr. President. This could divide the party, especially with certain voters." His voters, those that voted for the R-D's because Rockefeller was on the ticket.\n\n"The people voted for a conservative government, Nelson. Besides, you're here. You're at the table. That should be more than enough to make the liberals happy."\n\nRockefeller stood up, handed the piece of paper back. "It's your choice, Mr. President. You should have the people that agree with you around the table." His tone of voice made it clear that he wasn't happy about it. He turned on his heel and left the room.

 GLD.5.desc:0 "Barry Goldwater sat at the Resolute desk, looking at the binder of paper in front of him, labeled with "Current Federal Social Security and Subsidy Programs" on the cover. He rubbed his forehead, staring at the binder with almost two hundred pages of paper.\n\n"You have got to be kidding me," Goldwater said, adjusting his glasses before flipping open the binder, to see an index that listed all of them in alphabetical order. "Thirty years of welfare, and this is the result?"\n\n"Yes, Mr. President," Donald Regan said. The Treasury Secretary stood in front of the desk, shaking his head. "The first thing I did was get my staff to create this, with a brief description of each program the federal government runs, so we can figure out what we can get rid of."\n\nGoldwater flipped the page to the first program, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the AAA, and quickly read the description. "Pay farmers to not plant some of their land, and sell excess livestock to the government?" He frowned, grabbed the page, and with a satisfying rip, tore it from the binder. "That's the first one to go."\n\nThe President stuck his finger part way into the pages, and flipped the binder there. The Works Progress Administration, WPA. "Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure. And hire writers, musicians and painters to create art?" He tore that page out with a particular vengeance. "The last thing the government should be doing is paying anyone to splatter paint on a canvas. If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold."\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. "Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War," Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. "Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month.""I agree, Mr. President," Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. "I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss. Most of the rest can be amalgamated, and then have their combined budgets reduced to an appropriate level."\n\n"I want this binder to be less than half the size," Goldwater said, slamming the binder shut.

 GLD.6.t:0 "Cutting the Agricultural Budget"
 GLD.6.desc:0 ""Socialist Agriculture." That's the phrase that is being thrown around a lot lately amongst Democrats, right wing groups, and those around President Goldwater. The fact that millions of dollars a year are being spent to prop up thousands of farmers in the South when their crops don't yield as much as expected due to the lack of fertilizer and overused soil has become the newest bone of contention with Treasury Secretary Don Regan and his supporters, who seek to let the free markets determine who prospers and who doesn't. Why would anyone be willing to pay farmers to lose money? If they can't cut it, then they should sell their land to more successful farmers and get out!\n\nAlready there are protests by farmers throughout the South at state capitol buildings and federal courthouses, angry at how the government has been treating them over the past decade.\n\n"First all the Civil Rights nonsense, talking about making the blacks our equals. And now they want to destroy our livelihoods? There won't be a single free farmer left in Dixie by the end of the year if this happens. Everyone will be broke, or no better than a slave!"\n\nAlready activists have been going to small towns throughout Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi, telling the farmers about what their Democrat President is trying to do, and how they can fight back by supporting the National Progressive Party, especially the Far Right faction of the NPP. It remains to be seen if it will be enough to topple the stranglehold the Democrats have had on the South since the end of Reconstruction, but some Democrats are clearly afraid for their jobs in the next election."

 GLD.7.desc:0 "Various Presidents and administrations over the years have sought to leave their legacy on the nation, usually with bold programs to make the life of Americans better, easier, more productive and more. So catchy names and programs with a word-scramble of acronyms were created. The SSA, the WPA, the AAA, the FRA, NIRA and several dozen more. Slogans like "The New Deal," "the Fair Deal," and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Republicans or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

 GLD.20.desc:0 "Senator Wallace F. Bennett, Republican-Democrat of Utah, a wealthy businessman, and a former candidate for President of the US in the last election, has a plan to fix the economy. While he didn't get the chance in 1964 to put his plan into motion, now he might get the chance with a conservative like Goldwater in the White House. They had both worked together in the Senate for several years before hand, and Goldwater liked what he heard from Bennett's speeches and proposals for more international trade and re-establishing the Gold Standard. However, Goldwater decided against bringing Bennett onto his cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, instead going for the hardline conservative-libertarian Donald Regan, as he wanted someone he could trust in the Senate to help get his proposals through. Since most of it was Bennett's brainchild, so much the better.\n\nBy pursuing the twin goals of Free Trade and the Gold Standard, Goldwater and Bennett have what they perceive to be a winning strategy: increased prosperity, an end to the economic stagnation of the previous generation, and giving the American people hope for the future. Now, what shape Free Trade would take is still a matter of debate in the halls of power, as Goldwater's anti-fascist views means that increased trade with Germany and Japan would be abhorant to him, while concern over the size, wealth and even political will of the OFN members mean they aren't as great as markets as business leaders would like. And restoring a true gold standard can mean either great things if done right, or a huge economic crash if they fail. It will be a tightrope to walk, but Goldwater and Bennett are sure it can be done."

 GLD.21.t:0 "International Trade"
 GLD.21.desc:0 "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\n"But tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\n"We are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions. Now is the time for America to embrace free trade."

 GLD.22.desc:0 ""So America, I ask you: do you want to trade with a people that use slavery and torture? Do you want to become the nation that sells to the butchers of men? Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear."\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargos with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republican-Democrats, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, "Free Trade" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Democrats, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this "Goldwater Way." Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of "Free Trade." It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Democrat, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

Officially, it's been stated that the goal of the summit is to encourage more trade between the members of the OFN in a spirit of freedom and democracy, while still maintaining their strength and will to stand up to the Fascists and Imperialists in Eurasia.\n\nHowever, the US President has not been quiet about his desire to forge free trade deals and open more markets, which some of the smaller nations are hesitant, if not downright hostile to. After all, nations like Australia and South Africa, with smaller economies and businesses, would have to face off American behemoths like Ford, Standard Oil and Boeing. With vast resources, skills and labour, the US conglomerates could quickly monopolize these new markets, undercutting their competition and driving the smaller, local companies out of business altogether. But at the same time, the thought of Australian Holden cars or Canadian Avro planes being sold into one of the largest markets in the world with little in the way of tariffs is also deeply appealing.\n\nBut once we are all together, with the diplomatic niceties of being greeted by an honor guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a delicious dinner of wild-caught salmon in their bellies, the real work of international affairs can begin.

There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external Fascist threat from Europe, Asia and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n"I've gathered you here today to discuss...""

Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports.

By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their "America First" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck president.

And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade. Mexican's especially believe that the NATC is just a way to get their nation to join the American lead Organization of Free Nations alliance, which would end their decades of neutrality.\n\nAll these problems, and many more, will have to be overcome if the NATC is to be put in place. But Goldwater isn't daunted, and in fact seems to be relishing the chance to make the biggest effort yet to reshape the global economy."

Already some America's biggest corporations are announcing that they are planning on investing millions in Canada and Mexico on factories, while approvals from oil pipelines from Alberta and Veracruz are being sought to ship millions of barrels of crude to satisfy American demand. However, protests by Mexican indigenous groups that have had constitutional protections on their lands removed, Canadian farmers who are nervous of having the markets flooded with cheaper food, and unionized American workers afraid for their jobs have erupted across the continent.\n\nBut President Goldwater can be proud in what he has accomplished: he's made trade between the three major nations of North America open and free, and brought the US, Mexico and Canada closer together.

Namely that the former should be cut to the bone, and then some, and the later should be allowed to run free with next to nothing to hold it back. Some call it Libertarian, some call it Fiscal Conservatism. Barry Goldwater calls it Common Sense.\n\nEver since the Great Depression, Washington has steadily gained more and more power. At first it was welcomed: some make work programs to get the unemployed workers back to work. Then with the war and the mobilization for it, came inspectors, support for unions, restrictions, rationing of resources, all called temporary, all to win the war.\n\nBut even the war ended in humiliation and defeat, the technocratic, heavy handed bureaucrats and their stalwart allies in Congress doubled down, clinging to their offices and positions, throwing more and more money at every problem. But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt. Business was strangled under the increasing cost and frustration, leaving only those massive corporations with armies of lawyers to survive and stagnate, becoming monopolies. Unions too, for what are they but bloated bureaucracies that only survive to steal money from hard working Americans? The lazy and workshy, those that only have enough ambition to game the system for free money, now get checks from Uncle Sam to spend on booze and prostitutes, rich food and all the luxuries of a modern life, all by lying and cheating the average person. The American people became apathetic, weary, and resigned to this nightmare of red tape and thievery, undaring and meek in front of a monolithic entity of agencies, bureaus and departments.\n\nBut no more. Today begins the process of slashing through the bloated government. Programs are being re-evaluated. Taxes are being slashed. The debt will be erased. Budgets are going to be halved, and halved again. Thousands of paper pushers, whose only job it was to stifle everything about America, will be booted out to find some actual work. Those living the high-life on scamming the welfare system or squeezing the average man and woman for every dime will now have to actually find a job and be productive.

It was such a pleasure to get out of the endless hurly-burly of Washington, with its filth and smoke and smiling monsters waiting to sink a knife in him as soon as his back was turned. Yellowstone's quiet beauty brought him back to the simpler, happier days of his boyhood, running across Arizona's scorching scrublands with his brother and his sisters. Every American deserved to grow up like that, raised in nature's loving embrace.\n\nThe director let the President know they were ready. Goldwater took his place behind the podium, his back to the expanse of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The President had long been committed to the cause of environmentalism and the preservation of America's natural beauty, and he intended this to be his seminal speech to introduce the public to his love for America's National Parks, and to hopefully sway them to support his program for greater environmental protections and regulations. Goldwater often found it difficult to believe that so many Americans were willing to sacrifice nature's bounty in exchange for the pollution of industry and the soullessness of the urban sprawl. Taking a deep breath to steady his thoughts, he began.\n\n"My fellow Americans. Today I speak to you from Yellowstone National Park, greatest among America's natural monuments. Fifty years ago, this great nation made the commitment to protect and preserve our natural heritage, for these parks belong not to any man but to us all. I would carry on this proud tradition, and revitalise our national parks so that they may be enjoyed by our children and our grandchildren, and all who come after."\n\nAnd so he continued, extolling the virtues of the national parks and laying out his plan to enact a series of programs to preserve the environment and help the national parks grow and prosper.

Hot as the Yellowstone Caldera.\n\nIt was official: his dream of a government dedicated to protecting America's natural places had come to pass. The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency would be made public the following morning in a press conference, when he would, once again, face the flashing lights and the dark eyes of the cameras he had come to know so well.\n\nKnocking back his coffee, Goldwater allowed a small smile to grow as the scorching liquid warmed the inside of his chest. He reflected on the obstacles he had skirted around or smashed through to bring the EPA into being. The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill. It had been a battle well fought, and a victory well earned. After the endless bustle of the past few weeks, the President was finally able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a hot cup of coffee and a moment's peace, as well as the knowledge that he had forever ensured the preservation of America's natural heritage."

The forced merger of the old Republican and Democratic Parties, and the rise of the National Progressive Party to form the unwanted, yet unbreakable two party system that has been with our nation almost since our birth, has led to ideologues and populists of both extremes. Screaming at each other on the radio and on television, and drowning out the center in a flood of hate and anger. The moderates of both sides, those that can agree on compromises and get stuff done. There has been no direction, no course. America is a broken nation.\n\n"But today, we begin to repair it."\n\nIn his first major speech to the American people since his inauguration, President Goldwater identified many of the issues that faced America, including a divided political scene, a stagnating economy, and a listless population. But he also laid out his policy agenda, which is as bold and daring as any seen or heard since at least the Great Depression. While the details were limited, and Goldwater said that he would find the best course of action through discussion with his Cabinet and Congress, he promised that whatever it is, whatever he tries to do, it will be for the good of America as a whole.\n\nNewspaper editorials and radio commentators, those that often speak of gloom and doom, were much more upbeat the next day. Even Goldwater's opponents said they could respect the earnestness and forthright manner that he spoke, even if they couldn't agree with his prescription on how to cure the USA. But for those that voted for Goldwater in November, it was exactly what they wanted. A promise to solve the many problems that face America, no matter the cost."

Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later.

McNamara's proposal of what compromises and amendments to make to his initial plan for the Environmental Protection Agency lay on the desk, the object of his ire.\n\nMuch to his irritation, the President was forced to admit that McNamara's ideas would certainly be effective at pushing the EPA through Congress and establishing it with minimal blowback. Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line. If he signed, he'd be tarnishing one of his longest-held dreams, giving the polluters carte blanche to continue raping the natural world in exchange for agreeing to follow a handful of token restrictions. When he touched the pen to paper, he felt the familiar fiery indignation building in his chest. Would Michelangelo have knocked off David's head just to satisfy his critics?\n\nThe President faltered, torn. It'd be easy to sign and endorse McNamara's proposal, just a few strokes of the pen and he'd be able to avoid the anger of his voter base, and the party conservatives, and the business community. But, said that other little voice in his head, this is what you've been fighting for. Don't let them take it from you.\n\nDon't let the bastards win."

He knew plenty of the Republicans and the progressives in the NPP would rail against what they saw as him taking money out of the hands of the poor and giving it to a gang of tree-huggers and mountain-climbers, but he knew, with just the slightest smile, that it wasn't too likely they'd be able to sway the public to their side.\n\nThe fact was that most Americans would be glad or at the very least ambivalent towards the good news that the National Parks would continue to be a major pillar in the preservation of America's environment. Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

He could hear the man's laboured breath as he stumbled over a loose stone. Hard-faced and Quantico-fit, he fingered the revolver in his coat pocket, knowing it was only a matter of seconds until he caught his prey, panting and gasping like the obese hog he was.\n\nOh, he'd thought he was so clever. Unlike the rest of the dolts in the local chapter, the fat bastard had seen fit to question the man's sudden appearance at the weekly meetings. Far too clever for his own good, the pig had finally cornered him and uttered the words that would seal his fate. For once he'd been accused of being an FBI plant, the agent had no choice but to eliminate the swine, to keep his cover.\n\nDead end. His quarry spun around, beady little eyes barely visible through the fog. He began to beg for his life, but he was quickly cut off by a bullet to the brain. His corpulent body slumped to the rainwater-slick pavement, a thin line of blood slowly leaking out onto the concrete.\n\nThe agent spun at the sound of distant tires, startled at the appearance of a pair of headlights approaching out of the fog, staring him down like judging eyes. Shoving the revolver in his coat pocket, he clambered over a chain-link fence and skidded down a muddy slope to the street below, making his escape into a knot of twisting alleys.\n\nThe newspapers would call it a senseless murder, motiveless, no suspect. Used car salesman, father of three, devoted husband and pillar of the community. And, though it was not printed, Klokard of the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. With his death the agent's anonymity was safe, allowing him to continue reporting on their seditious behaviour, sifting for dirt to take them down.\n\nFor years to come, people walking that stretch of pavement would point the darkened bloodstain out to their friends, and wonder whose it had been."

The puddles covering the parking lot of the Philadelphia Sheraton Hotel, remnants of that morning's storm, glimmered like countless diamonds in the rays of sunlight poking through the clouds. Around him, three unmarked black cars screamed into the parking lot, disgorging a dozen hard-faced men in black suits. Crandall gave the signal, and they strode towards the hotel.\n\nTheir deep-cover boys in extremist groups had finally uncovered actionable intel on the greatest threat to the United States, the infamous fascist ideologue Francis Parker Yockey. After worming his way into Yockey's circle, an agent had reported to Quantico that Yockey always had with him a suitcase filled with forged passports with false identities; Mexican, Swedish, Australian, no doubt as insurance should he ever be forced to flee the country. Ironically, his attempt to escape the law had attracted them to him like a moth to a light. Before the day ended, Crandall would see the Nazi bastard in cuffs.\n\nCrandall and his boys marched across the Sheraton's opulent lobby, making no effort to wipe their feet. He flashed his badge at an irate desk clerk, and, without breaking his stride, flung open the doors to the convention hall where Yockey and his coterie were supposed to be hosting a fundraising event.\n\nInstantly he felt something was wrong. A hundred faces turned to him, but none of them were Yockey's. Gorge rising, his eyes groped for the sign proclaiming the name of the event: Christian Mothers for Teenage Abstinence. Swinging his gaze back to the conventioneers, he realized with a lurch of the stomach that they were middle-aged ladies one and all. Spluttering apologies, he slammed the doors behind him.\n\nThe bastard had flown the coop! Ignoring their shit-eating smirks, Crandall glanced over his men, wondering which of them was the snitch, then gruffly gave the order to return to the cars. They wouldn't get their man today. He was, Crandall reflected with irritation, probably already sipping a scotch and soda in an airplane bound for South America. Well, a man like Yockey wouldn't run forever. He'd come back, and when he did, they'd get him."

Ignoring the simple beauty of nature around him, Donald made a beeline for his charcoal-stained old firepit. Without ceremony, he dumped the box among the ashes, squirted it with kerosene, and lit it with a thrown match. Tongues of fire reflected in his eyes, Donald watched the flames consume his robes, the dark green fabric of the Grand Dragon crumbling into ash.\n\nAlthough he told himself that what he did was out of simple pragmatism, Donald was afraid, a fear that would rule him for the rest of his days. He frowned as he stared into the flames.\n\nFollowing the radio's announcement that the Klan would be banned and its leaders arrested, a thousand similar scenes played out across America. In a single night, the power and organization of the Klan was decisively crushed by the President's agents, by methods of sometimes arguable legitimacy. Nevertheless, there was a change in the air. A new era was dawning, one in which black people could walk the streets without fear, their would-be tormentors hiding inside, peering with bloodshot eyes through the venetian blinds, forever wondering.\n\nWondering if today would be the day they got the call in the night."

Although the man himself has vanished, presumably on his way to safe haven in Europe or South America on a phony passport, we've torn his power to shreds and, in doing so, we've excised the pulsing tumour at the nation's heart.\n\nThankfully, there has been little backlash to our persecution of the fascist fifth-columnists lurking within our society. Yockey has long been a stain on the NPP, and as much as they'd love to denounce us for attacking their party members, they can't do so without looking like they're endorsing his sick ideology. After all, Joe Citizen has little sympathy for fascism after the humiliations heaped upon us by Germany and Japan.\n\nEnjoying his morning coffee, President Goldwater allowed himself a moment of quiet triumph. He felt like the hero slaying the dragon in those old adventure tales he'd read as a kid, all those years ago in the hazy Arizona of his memory. He'd broken the back of Yockey, the Jew-hater, the would-be Imperator.

Through the outstanding efforts of the FBI, we have been able to sneak into the meetings of the Left-NPP and discover their secret plans with little ease. Their talk of wealth redistribution and the so-called "welfare state" is undermining the principles our founding fathers laid out for us: the party must be crushed and humiliated for America's sake.

We cannot afford such a drastic change in politics when we are already so far into the diplomatic war with Germany and Japan.\n\nLNPP meetings of any size will be banned indefinitely.

Our education system needs to focus more on the failures of Communism so that we could prevent any possibility for a socialist revolution in the future.\n\nThis latest Senate-approved bill will accomplish just this task. The bill revamps the social studies class by adding our own anti-Communist propaganda to further lead students away from the false glimmer of the red star. A Knoxville, Tennessee teacher described her support for the new bill, "I mean, look at Russia when they adopted Communism. There's no telling what kind of authority stretches across that barren land now. I would hate to live in an America that looks like those thousand-piece puzzles. Hopefully our kids grow up to hate those wretched Reds."\n\nThe LNPP responded as predicted: a few small protests here and there across major U.S. cities. One such protest in Minneapolis turned violent as the leftists were struck by average citizens whose everyday lives were disrupted.

Some newspapers were reluctant, while others began bizarre campaigns against the LNPP, with one local Utah paper calling all leftists "Communist Mutants From Space". Even the more moderate positions of the LNPP are coming under fire for "attempting to inject their awful beliefs into our pure American society".\n\nSince the inception of this campaign, any newspaper, regardless of the amount of readers, will be federally funded for any anti-Communist articles. This has led to a growing number of pro-Yockey and fascist newspapers gaining attention, especially in the South and Midwest, the old headquarters of American Populism.

"I know you are not in favor of regulations and such, but most of them are in place for a reason. We no longer poison people from what they eat, or injure them when they are building skyscrapers."\n\n"Don has shown me a lot of research that shows that if we get slackers off the dole, and let companies actually, you know, make stuff, that the whole economy will prosper," Goldwater replied, trying to keep a calm demeanor. "That will be enough to keep the R-Ds together."\n\n"Not if we are sending thousands of people into starvation!" Rockefeller yelled. "Are you willing to let that happen?""If it makes the country better off, then fuck them!" Goldwater bellowed.The argument went back and forth like this for half an hour, a clash of conservatism and liberalism, with tempers flaring and eventually Rockefeller put his foot down.\n\n"Mr. President, you have a choice. If you do what Regan is suggesting, you can kiss the Republican-Democrats goodbye. I know quite a few congresspeople that would rather work with the NPP than you. So, it's your choice to make."

In a stunning move, many Senators from the President's own party stood up and left the Senate Chamber soon after the debate began on the budget.\n\nThe Republican faction of the R-Ds has been vocally opposed to the President's language and actions in the past few weeks in attempting to cut spending, especially on welfare programs. However, many senators are saying that it was even worse than they thought once they got the chance to read the budget, which led to the Republican Walkout today.\n\n"It is perfectly clear now who the President is supporting," one senator said to reporters as he left the Capitol Building. "And it isn't the average American, or those in dire need of help and assistance. All Goldwater is helping is his libertarian and arch-conservative allies, who want to run roughshod over the poor and struggling."\n\n"This isn't simply balancing the budget," another Senator remarked. "This is an outright declaration of war on the poor, the colored, and disabled. How can we even consider such a proposal without looking at the blood on our hands?"\n\nDemocrats have long supported cutting such spending, seeing it as wasteful, ineffective, leading to a larger government and reducing the liberty, freedom and work ethics of the American worker.\n\nThis may be a huge blow to President Goldwater.

We already have reports of many banks dealing with long lines to exchange bills for gold and silver coins up to the daily limit, but they are managing to fulfill all requests made by their depositors. However, many Americans are not going to immediately exchange their bills for gold coins, but there is a confidence amongst everyone that if they want to, they can.\n\nWith the confidence of gold backing up the US dollars, and the measures we put in place to keep prices stable and reasonable, we should soon be seeing inflation level off and businesses profits increase. While it may be too early yet to determine the full effects, I'm confident that this accomplishment will bring new prosperity and growth to the United States for years to come."

 GLD261descfailure:0 "Terrible news Mr. President! Our efforts to get the US back on to the Gold Standard has failed! Banks are overwhelmed by furious depositors trying to get their bills exchanged for precious metals, though most have run out, and there is no way for us to get more coins to them any time soon. Those that are not getting the gold or silver are now sure they are being swindled, and banks are on the verge of collapsing. Not only that, but our efforts to set price limits on goods to prevent inflation has also backfired: most of the goods we sought to restrict are now being sold for much more than we decreed, and many stores are being overwhelmed as panicked shoppers try to stock up on everything from canned foods to toilet paper.\n\nNeedless to say, this has been perhaps the worst thing to happen to our economy since the Great Depression. Already many businesses are facing a credit crunch, and layoffs are soon to be widespread. Republican-Democrats in Washington are unable to work together, with liberals blaming conservatives for their misguided actions, and conservatives are accusing liberals of sabotage. The only ones that seem to be enjoying the current situation are the NPP across the aisle. Already, C-NPP leaders and supporters are gloating, saying how they will fix all this. Rumors of impeachment are already spreading through Congress, and, to be frank... we might deserve this. Maybe we should have listened to the experts?"

There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Party, while Rockefeller was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the R-D's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Rockefeller to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Rockefeller, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nThe bad blood wasn't going to go away, especially not overnight even with the victory in the election. But that didn't mean that Goldwater couldn't at least try.\n\n"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. And I would like your opinion on a few of the posts," Goldwater replied.\n\nThat caught Rockefeller off guard. "Excuse me, Mr. President?"\n\n"I want to get some Republicans and Liberals around the table. To show that I'm being serious about uniting the Party. Namely Health, Education, Interior, Labor. I know they aren't the fanciest positions, but I want to show that I'm willing to listen to different opinions."\n\nRockefeller leaned back on the couch, surprised at what Goldwater was saying. After all these months of helping to get a man that was against nearly everything that he stood for into the Presidency, he was now getting an olive branch in return.\n\n"So, can I get your help, Nelson?"\n\n"Of course, Barry.""

Several unknown authors formed a group called the Patrons of Franklin to criticize Goldwater's unlawful behaviors, citing violations of the First Amendment. The authors used pen names such as Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry, and Paul Revere in their writings.\n\nGoldwater stood firm in the face of the media's elaborate questions, and his responses were on-point. His explanations regarding the evils of socialism were as reasonable as they were crystal clear. His delicately-prepared reasoning ended many doubts the public had about the introduction of anti-Communist propaganda.

Several newspaper articles written about me were... very difficult to comprehend; it was at that moment I realized I had put my own interests above the interests of all of you. We aren't a civilization built on hate and prejudice, like the Nazis or the Kenpeitai; we listen to the voice of the people here.'\n\nCritics easily judged Goldwater's introduction as 'too obvious that he was trying to roll back on his beliefs' and that he was being 'blatantly deceitful'.

FR-NPP politicians considered Goldwater "a cheating liar" and "the first bogus President in a long time". According to a Gallup poll released after the conference, Goldwater's popularity with the American people decreased as much as 10%.

Officer Alistair MacKinnon was killed instantly, his partner Officer Brock Tarrant taking cover and calling for reinforcements. A tense 7-hour siege ensued with the perpetrators. An FBI negotiator was brought in from Quantico, but the perpetrators refused to respond to any attempts at communication and fired on police when they attempted to recover Officer MacKinnon's body, the dramatic exchange captured on film. On the Governor's order, the FBI was stood down and the perpetrators were engaged by riot police. By 8:45 PM, police had breached the house and killed all four perpetrators, all confirmed to be white males aged 22-38. They also took one unarmed white female into custody. Upon investigation of documents recovered at the scene, the perpetrators have been identified as members of a fringe-right terrorist group comprised of former followers of fascist criminal Francis Yockey. Though it may sound incredible, according to their records, the group, calling themselves Avengers for America, were formulating a plan to assassinate the Hollywood actress and outspoken left-wing activist Jane Fonda for her connection to the Black Panther Party on an upcoming film shoot in Maryland. For now, Mrs. Fonda and the residents of Baltimore can rest easy knowing another threat to their freedom has been defeated.\n\nPresident Goldwater set the newspaper down to look over the photographs. One filled almost half a page, showing Officer Tarrant in a particularly heroic pose, engaging the Yockeyites as his fellows attempt to retrieve the supine body of his murdered partner.

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer-drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement stand for the NPP's nomination in 1972.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody. Sipping his coffee, the President wondered what to do about the situation. He could put an end to their little commie propaganda campaign, but it might look like a restriction of free speech. Alternatively, he could just ignore it and let them have their poster-boy. No doubt they'd run out of steam soon enough."

Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning.

The unions stifled all attempts to speak out against such cases of unfair treatment, either with community conformity or with brute thugs masquerading as their "comrades" glowering behind every eye corner.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, these men took the federal government's hand, no matter how questionable its presence, if it meant the chance to sterilize these reservoirs of corruption from top to bottom..."

 GLD.union.7.desc:0 "Barry's answer came in the form of one comprehensive bill authored by the Democrats, fast-tracked from one hearing and committee to the next, and finally put out on a vote in both houses of Congress. Its title succinctly summarized its contents: Extensive restrictions on the how's and what's of union recruitment practices. Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Democrats bellowed their assent, Republicans muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their "commitment to beloved principle". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill. The Ayes and Nays have been courted, arms twisted, favors owed and hands shaked. President Goldwater can only shuffle in his seat and see these maneuvers waltz a Congressional ballet on the session floor -- if, of course, they decide to attend at all.."

No, paper this valuable deserved only the most perfect strokes the aging President's hands can create. So did the fountain pen rise and fall in loops to make a capital B, then run another loop crosswise to make a small A, and so on until it stopped as a cursive r's little right notch. With the signature drying up on its front page, the Union Recruitment Standards Act finally became law.\n\nAs soon as the President set his pen to its holder the Oval Office exploded in congratulatory applause and thanks. Shaking hands and hugs wormed their way around the gaps between smartly tailored suits. Cameras snapped a watershed moment for American labor into memory with incandescent flash powder.\n\nSo too did they capture President Goldwater's smiling mien, right before he treated himself with a sip of coffee from a worn-out mug.

Less sympathetic observers would describe the President's response as a diatribe spoken in bad faith.\n\nTwo hundred million Americans react as variedly as one would expect from two hundred million minds. The God-fearing families of the South and Southwest bore the same heavy heart as their President had carried in front of national television. Contrariwise, the working men of Yankeedom and the Pacific Coast paid less heed to the Arizonan's words than the riotous parties they held in celebration of Congress's decision.\n\nAs the minutes wore on and the denouncements petered out, President Goldwater ambled out of the screen after hurling one last snipe at his hated opponents, the trade unionists: "Duplicitous hydras with Medusa's petrifying gaze," he said.

For such a vast, multifaceted campaign with many avenues of failure, diverging opinions on which strategy to undertake was perhaps more of an inevitability than he thought. At least there was consensus on who first to deal with -- that onerous honor belonged to the Senators sympathetic to the trade unionists' cause. Where American compromise stumbled was in these Senators' party affiliations.\n\nIn this issue his allies are split into two roughly even camps. The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Republicans share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence.

Dubbed the Labor Union Standards Bill, it aims to introduce new requirements in order for a trade union to organize with the federal government's blessing and operate within its jurisdiction. These include a clean record sheet for the past twenty five years, limits on the revenue they report to the IRS, non-affiliation with socialist parties active in the United States, and others.\n\nSenators from the National Progressive Party decry the President's latest initiative, calling it "[a] gross infringement on the American worker's right to organize."

In a joint statement with notable activists, progressive officials and renowned labor organizers, AFL-CIO President George Meany rebuked President Goldwater for "failing to uphold the political liberties of American workers", and that the union will "do whatever it can to prevent the American worker's rights from further attack".

Each side did whatever they could to convince the law of the other's guilt, if not their own innocence.\n\nBut there were only so many hours in a day, and everyone involved expected a speedy trial.

But he thought himself tough, that there's always next times lying in wait just ready to be caught with fresher hands, new opportunities to get what he wants where he wants it.\n\nHis copy of The Washington Times, just a few hours old, had crumples and tear notches with how tight his shaking fists latched onto its margins. In front page, bold text:\n\n"SUPREME COURT RULES 7-2 AGAINST PRES. GOLDWATER"\n\nThere was no getting out of this loss, that much he knew.\n\nWith a wordless cry he threw the crumpled newspaper aside. A hand reached out for a mug of coffee on the Resolute Desk, only to find no purchase. Right, he'd thrown that too, hadn't he? Now it was just fragments of wet, sticky ceramic on the marble floor. Hit the bird splayed at the center of the Oval Office square in the eye too. Cleaning staff can take care of the mess.\n\nSighing, he rose up and hobbled towards the windowpane. Warm and sunny outside, like the good Lord couldn't give a rat's ass about his loss. What did he do to earn His disfavor? Doing the good thing?

Lash out at his fellow Americans for not backing him to the hilt. Lash out at the Justices for letting the union bastards get off scot-free. Lash out at God for not sending him a miracle at the end of so much effort. Hatred was strong and raw then, so very tempting to wield.\n\nThankfully, reason quickly reasserted itself. He had his victories, the unions have theirs. He may not have brought the whole thing down, but neither had they gotten away without a nasty limp. He still has half of America on his side, and a good chunk of Congress to boot. His campaign's wounded and bleeding -- but it's not yet out. Never out, if he had his way.\n\nAnd so it was that he addressed his Cabinet later in the day, thanking them for the work they were putting to bring the unions down. They needed reassurance after seeing them "come to naught" against the AFL-CIO. No matter, he said, there's still everyone else.

The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office.

Spare time was hard to come by for a foreman in a Pittsburgh steel plant and an accountant in some hifalutin marble bank.\n\n"When didn't I have a point, dear?" she chimed, nuzzling his chest.\n\n"There's that one time you tried your hand with a microwave-"\n\nA somewhat painful headbutt to his chin. "Lunkhead. Need I remind you that was one time only?"\n\nHis calloused hands brushed the length of Willow's silver-dyed, back-length hair. "Didn't stop you from trying it again last Christmas..." James muttered.\n\nShe replied by bearhugging the arm in her greedy hands' possession.\n\nDespite his bones creaking and his limb slowly turning numb, James managed a smile. He loved seeing his wife just... let loose like this every now and then. All the better to take her mind off the suits squatting in her office. With tubs of lard like those to tolerate eight hours a day, that she hadn't already burst a blood vessel open was a miracle in itself. And good husbands keep that from happening, don't they?"

The ice pack did little to stem the pain while he drove to the weekly union meet. "You know how she is," he sighed.\n\nHis diminutive coworker crossed her arms, frowning. "Doesn't make it any less dumb. It's just once every week, she can handle herself without you for a few hours, right?"\n\n"She saw one of the ads last night and-"\n\n"And she fell for 'em hook, line and sinker."\n\nThe blonde mulled over the words phrased not as a question, but as a statement of fact. Willow and his old friend had their... disagreements, which inevitably bled into how James should spend his time. He'd learned to choose his words carefully when the topic is broached; in this case, the only sensible decision was to say nothing at all.\n\n"Seriously," Rosie grumbled, "what good's those degrees of hers if she can't tell facts from all the horse dung in Gramps's farm? Clear as day, Goldy's ads are all..." She hummed in thought, pinching at an imaginary beard. "All..."\n\n"Gobbledygook?" James offered.\n\nAnyone else and they'd have given him a questioning stare for a word supposedly only children would say. But his friend had a welcoming sense of humor, he thought happily, if the titters that left her lips said anything. Seconds later, they evolved into stomach-aching chortles that echoed through the waiting lobby and caught the attention of the handful early arrivals mulling about.\n\nRosie's laughter drew in their nods and smirks -- not at her, for some reason, but at James instead. He returned each with a level stare before leaning to his side. The womanly bell chimes lifting his spirits up smothered their suspicious looks somewhat. If nothing else, they made for pleasant ambience while the lobby waited for Boss Atwood and the rest."

 GLD.Speer.1.desc:0 "In spite of himself, Speer could feel his fists tensing beneath his desk.\n\n"And is it certain that their decision as it stands is final?" he asked, calmly.\n\n"Yes, my Führer. I believe Goldwater made a point of it during his election campaign. He sees trade with the Fatherland as... not in their national interest."\n\nThere was a moment's pause, as Speer shut his eyes and gently rubbed the bridge of his nose. Finally, he responded: "Get me Schmidt. Tell him to stop whatever he's doing and come here at once." At this command, the orderly gave him a quick salute and departed the office immediately.\n\nA furrowed brow was the only indication of the fury building within Speer's heart. After all his valiant effort towards detente with the Americans, this new president was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office. The concerned look on his face as he saluted indicated that he was clearly already aware of the situation. "You asked to see me, my Führer?"\n\n"The Americans have restored the embargo. I want you to contact their government and ask them... no, you are going to tell them that we will talk this out. I will not allow our efforts to normalize relations be in vain." Speer did not turn from the window as he spoke.\n\nSchmidt nodded thoroughly. "I will get their Foreign Minister on the phone at once. How soon should I ready the diplomats to meet with our counterparts?"\n\n"Immediately.""

 GLD.Speer.2.t:0 "A German Foot in the Door"
 GLD.Speer.2.desc:0 "Robert McNamara had taken a break for lunch when his secretary barged in, informing him that German Foreign Minister Helmut Schmidt was on the phone. He supposed it was only a matter of time before they came protesting about the embargo, though he wished it had not come during his brief respite.\n\nHelmut Schmidt was a curious character. Despite his nation's poor diplomatic reputation, the man seemingly oozed a calm sort of confidence. Irrespective of the animosity between their nations, Schmidt was cordial as he spoke at length with McNamara.\n\n"Mr. McNamara, speaking on behalf of Führer Albert Speer and the Greater German Reich, I implore your government to reconsider this course of action. There is much benefit to be had from trade between our two great nations, I'm sure you understand. I am willing to personally travel to negotiate with your president, in the interests of normalizing diplomatic relations once again."\n\nWithin hours of this phone call, McNamara sat in the Oval Office, recounting the discussion to President Goldwater. "The Germans seem willing to parley with us, but the American public expects us to uphold our promises and stop trade with the fascists," McNamara concluded. "I told him I would call him back with your response shortly. What do you want me to say, Mr. President?"\n\nGoldwater thought for a moment. It was certain that America held the upper hand. Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra. "Get him back on the line. I've made my decision.""

 GLD.Speer.3.desc:0 ""My Führer... the Americans have-"\n\n"Yes, Schmidt," Speer interrupted gloomily, "I already know."\n\nThe Americans had rejected the Reich's request for negotiations, and already Speer had been inundated with panicked communiques from business leaders whose property and staff abroad suddenly found themselves declared illegal. German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n"The Americans aren't taking us seriously." He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. "They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously."\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. "Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them."\n\nThere was silence at the table. "Pardon, my Führer?" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. "We can arrange a meeting. In neutral territory; perhaps Switzerland? I am willing to speak to them there."

 GLD.Speer.4.desc:0 ""You're serious? The Führer's actually proposing that I meet him one on one?"\n\n"I scarcely believed it myself, Mr. President. But the offer is genuine. I spoke directly with Mr. Speer on the phone, and he is insistent that he is willing to personally negotiate this."\n\nAcross the desk from McNamarra, President Goldwater sat back in his chair. This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country."\n\n"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet."\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called "master race" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."

The American Foreign Minister was quite adamant, their President has no interest in speaking with us."\n\nSpeer did not speak for a moment. He had expected this, of course, but it was nonetheless disappointing. And humiliating. "I understand. Thank you for letting me know, Schmidt. You can leave now." Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world. Germany would have to pull itself from the ashes without reliance on America or any other nation, just as it had done once before."

"The American President, my Führer! He agreed to the meeting. He is on his way to Geneva as we speak."\n\nSpeer slowly put down his pen and stared at Schmidt in disbelief. His long shot plan had worked. A moment passed as Speer collected his racing thoughts. Finally he stood, almost too quickly, and motioned for Schmidt to follow him as he marched from the office. "Cancel my appointments for the week," he instructed his secretary as he passed, "and have someone pack my travel essentials."\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt. "We have much to prepare. This meeting is crucial for the future of our relations and for Germany's place in the world. Goldwater will almost certainly be playing from a position of strength and, well, I must confess I am no diplomat.\n\nSchmidt struggled to keep up. "I understand, my Führer. I will help wherever I can. If you like, I can help you practice the negotiations."\n\n"I would much appreciate that. I will need all the help I can get." Pausing in the hallway, he turned to Schmidt and took him by the arm.\n\n"This is a historic moment. We must not let it go to waste.""

 GLD.Speer.7.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide"
 GLD.Speer.7.desc:0 "Packing, preparing and flying out to Geneva took less than two days, such was the expediency of the federal branch for such an important occasion. As the plane approached landing, the Secret Service agents aboard began hurriedly running through procedure one more time, and for the first time President Goldwater began to grow nervous. Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet," he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute. Instead, Speer stepped forwards with a slight smile, reached out his hand and greeted him, in English.\n\n"Good afternoon to you, Mr. Goldwater.""

 GLD.Speer.8.desc:0 "The American President Goldwater had arrived at the hotel shortly before Speer himself. Speer had debated what to do upon meeting him, considering a quick salute and a bow of acknowledgement, but Schmidt had argued that a simple handshake and a greeting in English would be more diplomatic. And so the two had shaken hands, being immortalized in an image likely by now already circling through the world's media. The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. "How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?" asked Speer.\n\n"Pleasant," replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. "I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?"\n\n"Indeed, indeed." As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."

The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Goering to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world." Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."

The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany."\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."

Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please."\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree?

"Is this why you brought me here today? So that you could propose sidestepping my authority and slipping into the western markets through the backdoor?" He leaned forwards before Speer had a chance to speak up. "Listen to me, Mr. Speer. I vowed to my people that I would shut fascism out of the Organisation of Free Nations.

"This was a productive meeting, Mr. Goldwater. I look forward to future dialogue with the United States".\n\nGoldwater paused as he returned the handshake. Shaking hands with a man whose country would consider someone of Jewish blood like himself as less than human still felt troubling. "This was more... diplomatic than I was expecting. Thank you for your time". With that, the two men departed the hotel for their respective return trips.\n\nGoldwater had a lot of time to think as his flight made its journey back to America. What would he say to the press? How would the party respond to his unexpected u-turn? What was his own take away from all of this? This had certainly not been the trip he had anticipated, and he was unsure if he would ever feel completely at ease about it. It was all making his head spin.

That Goldwater, a man who had taken power on a platform of anti-fascist opposition and anti-German sentiment, had been convinced of the error of his ways was a great victory for the Reich - and for world trade as a whole.\n\nAs he returned to Germania, he was first greeted by Schmidt. "An excellent display, my Führer!" said Schmidt as he pushed a copy of the morning paper into his hands. The headline celebrated Germany's diplomatic coup, hailing Speer's overpowering of the USA's decision. It was a little embellished, as all German media tended to be, but Speer supposed it would do.\n\nAs he returned to his duties as Führer, Speer felt satisfied that he had proven his worth and demonstrated his new path for Germany.

Weakness in the face of the tasks that still lay ahead for Germany was unacceptable.\n\nSitting at his desk, he considered where Germany might go from here.

 GLD.Speer.103.desc:0 "The talks had failed. Though it had been Speer's own idea, the world's media was already awash with images of Speer marching frustrated from the hotel. The images of Goldwater emerging moments later showed a face tinged with equal parts irritation and smugness. That was exactly how he felt as he flew home over the Atlantic. It was a wasted journey, but at least he had made Speer look like a fool.\n\nWhen Goldwater arrived back in America, he found himself quickly swept before the journalists, all eager to hear his account of things. He smiled for the cameras, and waited for the hubbub to die down before speaking.\n\n"Mr. Speer is no different to his predecessor, nor any of those who tried to claim Germany in the past. He believes that his country deserves all the bounty of the free world without being a part of that free world. I tried to be reasonable, and I decided to hear him out in the interests of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, it is clear that even under its new ruler, the ego of the German nation knows no bounds.\n\n"Let this be a lesson to all those who rule with an iron fist. If you are willing to extend liberty, then liberty will extend its bounty unto you. If not, then the bounty shall forever be denied."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a smile as he returned to the White House. He had kept his promise to the American people, shown up the forces of fascism, and demonstrated once and for all that America would always stand tall in the face of tyranny. It would surely be a great precedent for the future of the world - and for the future of his election prospects."

 GLD.flavor.1.desc:0 "Even when the weather is warm, the nights in the Bronx get cold sometimes. Maybe it's the blandness of the tenement brick, maybe it's the polluted city air.\n\nPerhaps, though, it's the rotten state of this country. At least to Robert.\n\nRobert can trace his heritage back to some of the first emancipated slaves in America. His grandfather served in the Harlem Hellfighters. His own father gave everything in the Pacific, and never came home. Robert, directionless after high school, decided to enlist in the Army. Life was rough after being injured in South Africa. Even in a state like New York, no place had room for a handicapped minority man. He worked odd jobs for years, barely scraping by with the help of the NPP's generous welfare programs. While he didn't care much for politics, his interest peaked at a president which promised economic prosperity for all.\n\nBut that was then. No more food stamps, they say, it's a waste of money. We need to slash welfare; we could be using that for the environment, experts claim. Austerity, designed to bring economic prosperity for all and reduce the national debt, has simply taken it from the people who needed it most. Robert sighed, cold in his own home. Come next November, he's going to make his voice heard. Whoever is in that office, something is clear. He can't keep going on like this."

 GLD.flavor.2.desc:0 "The final bell rang at the NYSE. The floor, busy as ever, was stopped in a dead silence. While there was ticker tape everywhere and every investor was itching to get home, the reality of what just happened finally hit everyone.\n\nThe highest single day DOW Jones rise in history.\n\n"Gentlemen, everyone here today just made history!" The room explodes into applause. A bottle of champagne popped on the trading floor. Stock traders from opposite sides of the room are dancing together. "Tonight, your families will eat well. Little Suzie will get all the toys she wants for Christmas. You can finally buy that new car you've been eyeing for ages. Tonight, you will reap the rewards of the best economy in the history of the world!"\n\nThe sound is deafening; so much so that spectators outside pause in the street in awe. Although the people on the floor were simple stock traders, all from different walks of life, one thing was clear. They were rich, and they loved America. And perhaps, one day, everyone would be able to flourish from the economy that they've helped create. Public confidence has been restored in a system that works for everyone, with equal opportunity for success. No more will John Doe be scared of investment, scared of starting a business, or making money. The American Dream seems alive again."

 GLD.flavor.3.desc:0 "Joseph Miller was one of the lucky few seamen in his crew. Not many people made it alive out of that ship, but he was one of the fortunate ones. Ever since that fateful day in Midway, Joseph does his best working as a shift manager at a factory. The veterans benefits are good. He lives comfortably with his wife and two children. He's active in his community, gives rifle lessons, and recently spoke at his town hall. He was one of the many people who voted in the last election.\n\nToday, Joseph woke up bright and early, as he typically does. Usually he likes to start his day with a shower, and then reading the morning paper as Lucy makes him and the kids some breakfast. But this morning was a bit different. The paperboy came early. A few people were already outside their houses, so it must've been important. With a stretch and groan, Joseph opens the front door, and picks up the paper. "NPP OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON TAKING MONEY FROM JAPAN" is plastered on the front. Joseph rubbed his eyes, making sure that what he was seeing was true. With a pause, he closes the door, and sits down at the dinner table.\n\n"Honey, what's wrong? Is everything okay?"\n\n"Yes, Lucy. Apparently the neighbors thought today's paper is interesting. I don't blame them."\n\nPeople in these parts voted straight down the line for the NPP. Maybe it was out of solidarity for our brothers in California. Maybe it was because of how hard everyone here was hit by the war. Maybe it was just how things were here. But the more Joseph read of the paper, the more frustrated he got. To think that the people he voted for are taking money from the people who shot down his brother's plane infuriated him. He puts the paper down, and sighs heavily. If there is change to come this November, it'll certainly not be for a party which is funded by warmongers."

And, after years of these large businesses run by these successful and hardworking Americans having to wage war against Workers' Unions trying to hinder them to protect them from fictitious dangers at the workplace, President Goldwater has managed to secure a chokehold on Union creation. Finally, after so many years of muddled progress and holding back, American big business will once again flourish, and so shall we, as one united country!"

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, or the AFL-CIO, has become a thorn in the side of businesses across the country, weakening the ability of financial flourishing through its conquest of the American market via the creation of more and more sluggish Workers' Unions. It's not right, it's not American, and President Goldwater is on the case! Soon, the administration will open up a Supreme Court case in order to take down the massive grip of American prosperity that the AFL-CIO holds. Should we fold in court, however, our administration could risk everything..."

The Supreme Court Justices completely slaughtered our attempts to bring down the bloated AFL-CIO, and now, more than ever, the fat unionists will only clamber for more and more American businesses to bring under its control. We fought for American liberty, for the very American Dream which earned us our independence; however, now all we can find is the sorrow of defeat within the Presidency, and a lesser and lesser chance at reelection as thoughts towards the future echo throughout the President's mind..."

In the end, however, the wise members of the Supreme Court have realized the truth, justice, and righteousness in our cause against the AFL-CIO in an effort to realize a greater means of prosperity in our country! Whilst the Supreme Court did not fully obliterate the AFL-CIO, it did manage to create several impositions against the powers of the Unions and how much they can hamper large American businesses. And with this great victory for American business, so to comes the glory and respect of the American people for President Goldwater!"

Furthermore, President Goldwater has realized that the NPP stands as a far greater suspect in the game of corruption within the United States; thus, it ought to be our highest priority to snuff out corruption amidst the NPP before anywhere else in the government."

Finally, we shall undo the curses of corruption upon the American market that the extremely bloated and overzealous union organizations brought upon it, and bring about a new era of shiny, golden prosperity for all the hardworking American patriots throughout the country!"
