#McNamara

POLITICS_BOB_DESC:0 "Robert McNamara, President of the United States and arguably the most powerful person in the world, is not a passionate man. Years of quagmires abroad and at home have left him bitterly convinced that emotion is the death of reason. Without reason, there can be no stable democracy, and without stable democracy, there can be no America. Thus, if the nation is to survive the cold war in one piece, there can be no room for emotional compromises; efficiency and practicality rule above all. If military IQ standards must be lowered to allow for more recruitment, then they shall be lowered. If a foreign nation must be invaded to protect the American people, then it shall be invaded. If taxes must be raised to provide for the common defense, then they shall be raised. America's enemies do not share her pity, remorse, or fear; their politics demand that liberty must, so liberty must grow teeth of her own to ensure her survival.\n\nExceptionally well educated, with a long career in business before entering politics, McNamara has always championed efficiency over emotion, and now he stands in a uniquely strong position to execute his wishes upon the face of American politics. His plans include combining tax agencies, reforming the IRS to be less obtrusive to the average American, cutting the social safety net, and rapidly expanding federal power to satisfy his thirst for control. The more wasted money he can save from the incompetence of the United States government is more money he can use to bolster the country's military against the increasingly belligerent Germans and Japanese.\n\nNow, the question remains as to whether McNamara's ruthless efficiency and political practicality will be able to drain the swamp of Washington and transform America into the fearsome giant it once was, or fall flat on its face like so many before him. Regardless, any enemies of the United States would be wise to be wary of a man so detached from his emotional desires; such a man just might send the world tumbling into the abyss."

USA.1701.d:0 ""My fellow Americans, I stand before you today, having taken the oath of office that our forefathers have taken for nearly two centuries. Within many of our lifetimes, we will live to see a third millennium. Before the celebrations of such milestones, it is important to reflect on how our nation is, and how it shall be. I swear to you America: we will be a greater nation upon these celebrations."\n\n"America, for decades, our government has been plagued by inefficiency: wasteful, expensive, and otherwise useless programs that have weighed down the true strength of our nation. For many years, this incompetence was not so important, for the nation was strong and her enemies were few. Now, however, when we are constantly standing upon the precipice of conflict with foreign powers, such programs cannot be afforded. America must stand strong, undivided, and without frivolous distraction, if we are to outlast our enemies."\n\n"Beyond pure survival, though, let us rejoice that, should our almighty God give us strength, I believe we shall rise unto a new age of American prosperity. Taxes and the infernally wasteful IRS shall be streamlined, hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created, and near-every American shall be able to purchase a home and live in peace. You may hear these and believe them to be lofty goals, but I say they are quite achievable. All we need do is trim the fat from our government, and work as one united people.""

############ Bennett Response

POLITICS_WALLACE_F_BENNETT_DESC:0 "Wallace Foster Bennett: America's best hope for a stable future. Born in Salt Lake City to a pair of devout Mormons, Bennett's upbringing was heavily influenced by the tenets of his parents' faith. After a brief stint in the Army as an instructor, he married the youngest daughter of the Mormon President and began a career in business, eventually owning a successful Ford dealership. Like many ambitious men who had accomplished all their goals, Bennett chose to go into politics, being elected Senator for Utah in 1951, albeit under a cloud of controversy after accusing his opponent of being a closet communist.\n\nQuickly becoming a small-government and pro-business stalwart in the Senate, Bennett was soon entrenched as a major force in Washington pushing for conservative values. As the years wore on and America continued to stagnate, Bennett became convinced of the necessity to restore the nation's vitality, his conviction bolstered by Nixon's disgrace and the subsequent malaise that gripped America. Intent to prevent the NPP from steering America into uncertain waters, Bennett made the decision to throw his hat in the ring for the Presidency, hoping to keep the nation on track to a safe, stable and prosperous future.\n\nAlthough he may not have the charisma or big ideals of some of his opponents, Bennett's gambit paid off, the American public choosing a candidate who promised to hold the ship steady and put to rest their uncertainty for the future. Whether or not he will succeed remains to be seen, but it seems that the American public, like their new President, believe the old proverb: that slow and steady wins the race."

In these tumultuous times, he has promised to be a force of stability and compromise, refusing to take a hard line on most issues. Instead he believes that a nuanced approach, with input from both sides of a debate, is preferable. He has also laid out plans to strengthen America's position both within the OFN and beyond, with a myriad of economic and diplomatic programs aimed at uniting the planet's remaining bastions of democracy. There are some who argue that his policies are weak and that his compromises will ultimately leave nobody happy. However, with his personable nature and his willingness for dialogue with anyone, President Bennett might be just what America needs at this moment in history."

To this end, President Bennett has come up with a splendid idea - he shall speak to the people directly. He is clearly popular enough, given that the people voted for him. We have requested some time slots with national radio stations with which the president may engage in some "fireside chats", where he will present his case for a truly united America in a casual, personable manner. President Bennett will not just be the leader of the American people, but also their good friend."

The American government has been a bedrock of stability since 1776; any necessary changes have been made perfectly well with due process and gradualism. The radicals who believe that our system needs to be turned upside down only need to look to Germany and Japan to see the inevitable outcome of such sudden change. We will keep the government going as it always has, and ensure that the moderates of the Republican-Democrats always hold the balance of power."

USA_wfb_64_silver_act_desc:0 "Flush with gold and silver, our Founders decreed that these two precious metals are the bedrock upon which the value of our dollars are established. The use of either has changed as political winds shift over the course of two hundred years; currently, emergency legislation from the Depression ties the dollar to silver bullion only, rather than silver and gold.\n\nThis, however, leaves the American dollar reliant on a metal whose deposits are increasingly being outpaced by America's economic growth. Eventually, the country will run out of bullion before it runs out of greenbacks. To rectify the looming crisis, President Bennett aims to decouple the dollar from silver in increments - using less silver in coinage, restricting dollar-to-silver conversion, etc. - and eventually reunite the country's currency with the much more plentiful gold.\n\nMankind may not want to be crucified upon a cross of gold, says a certain presidential candidate... but neither will it agree, surely, to be crucified had the cross been made of silver instead."

Our propensity to exchange products for money with faraway customers has benefited America's economy since its founding. Free trade policies ensure that such transoceanic agreements will continue unabated save for the gravest of externalities.\n\nPresident Bennett has announced a series of free trade agreements and similar policies that shall apply among, and to be ratified by members of, the OFN. Representatives from its member states have thus far voiced their approval of the President's attempts to strengthen the alliance through such entreaties of mutual economic cooperation."

USA_wfb_64_build_up_reserves_desc:0 "For all the virtues we foist upon gold, it is as much a precious metal as silver: Valuable, heavy, and limited. Fort Knox only has so much gold bullion to support an economy as titanic as the United States', even if its gold mines are degrees more plentiful than their silver counterparts.\n\nTo prepare for the eventual transition, President Bennett has urged the appropriate federal apparatuses to build up our gold bullion reserves for the rest of his term."
USA_wfb_64_fix_exchange_rates:0 "Fix Exchange Rates"
USA_wfb_64_fix_exchange_rates_desc:0 "Free trade, by default, assumes a degree of reciprocity: In order for both parties to benefit from a trade, their balances must not grow at the latter's expense. Should one side profit significantly more than the other, then the ensuing trade imbalance will result in an increasingly untenable relationship that sours long-term friendly relations as ably as war.\n\nComplicating attempts to establish mutually favorable trade agreements among OFN members is the disparity in value caused by its proverbial anarchy regarding national exchange rates -- one for the Canadian dollar, another for the Australian dollar, another still for the Guyanan and West Indies dollars. President Bennett believes that a solution may be found in fixing their rates with respect to the American dollar, and at values which benefit us and them in equal measure."
USA_wfb_64_free_access_clause:0 "The "Free-Access" Clause"
USA_wfb_64_free_access_clause_desc:0 "Free movement goes hand-in-hand with free trade; in fact, one can say traditional requirements to travel abroad belong to the very barriers which free trade inherently opposes. Tolls, tariffs and lengthy permits all impede the free flow of goods between nations, often at significant cost to both producer and consumer. Compounding this issue is the fact that such laws differ from country to country; keeping track of them all without a universal standard stifles, and has stifled, trade beyond reason.\n\nTherefore, President Bennett, keen on reforming yet another facet of the largest alliance of democracies on Earth, plans on dismantling some of these barriers by proposing unified immigration and tariff standards for the OFN. If ratified, they will ease cross-member state movement of people and goods to an unprecedented extent."
USA_wfb_64_gold_standard:0 "The Gold Standard"
USA_wfb_64_gold_standard_desc:0 "Now that the US dollar is deemed sufficiently weaned from silver, President Bennett and his economic advisors have begun drafting a bill along with leading Republican-Democrat Congressmen to reinstate the gold standard as its bedrock. Its implementation may cause short-term, potentially destabilizing fluctuations in the stock market and economy, although economists predict that the long-term stability and growth the transition provides are worth its repercussions."

USA_wfb_64_our_burden_desc:0 "With a population of over two hundred million and the lively economy to match, the United States is an economic powerhouse surpassing even the German Reich and the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere. The same cannot be said of the quiltwork of erstwhile colonies and new nations which comprise the rest of the OFN -- yet we demand equal contributions, militarily and diplomatically, from them in exchange for membership. Hardly a fair deal, in any estimation.\n\nThough they will never match what we can achieve, President Bennett believes it is our responsibility to bring them closer to our level regardless. Thus, he plans on having America shoulder a portion of their debt and inject dollars into their markets, encouraging healthier budgets and stronger consumer spending."

To our east, the German tyrants oppress a whole continent and consign millions to the century-old evils of slavery. To our west, the Rising Sun scorches the backs of a billion laborers in the name of a Sphere whose luxuries they must craft, but can never partake of. Freedom has marched a hasty retreat since the Second World War, and in its exhaustion it has settled upon Lady Liberty's star-spangled crown. Its influence has manifested in the achievements we have since attained in furthering the freedoms of men -- economic, political, social.\n\n"Today we are mired in a war of higher purpose than any war undertaken by any man in human history. It is brinksmanship - not of arms, but of words and deeds. It is won only through exploiting the flaws of lasting ideologies, not the flaws of short-lived men. Thus there is no better time to flaunt the timeless principles which we, the people, have enshrined in our democracy's laws: That all men are created equal, and that we all are bestowed by God the inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...""

Strong, choice words. But brash and short-sighted as well.\n\n"America's greatest political achievements have been achieved by the simple art of compromise. Change in a country spanning one continent and two hundred million souls does not come easy, and the Founders had the foresight to predict the growing pains their country will face -- pains we are suffering now. Change in the Bill of Rights hence came in the form of increments shaped by painstaking compromises from America's greatest statesmen."\n\n"Without such demonstrations of due caution, it is safe to conclude we will not have enjoyed the freedoms the Constitution now proclaims... nor, for that matter, a whole and indivisible nation to call our own...""

With the surge of goods followed consumer-friendlier prices and an upswing of new jobs on both sides of the oceans flanking our shores.\n\nAt seeing the new trade policies working above and beyond expectations, the President's policymakers have suggested completely excising tariffs to negligible or near-zero percentages."

Rather, he thinks that the OFN would be better served practicing the democracy it celebrates.\n\nAmong the policies intended to bring such opinion into being include providing all member-states with an equal say in deciding upon the organization's decisions and mandates. In this setup America would, ideally, only be first among equally-sized cogs comprising the great machine of freedom and prosperity.\n\nA loose coalition of Democrats and National Progressives have spoken out against President Bennett's decision, citing the "wilful weakening" of America's influence within the OFN.

Twenty years on, he remains a respected figure among Congressmen, Democrat-Republican or National Progressive.\n\nMore germane to the President's purposes is Secretary Hull's fervent advocacy for strengthening America's ties with the free nations of the world. By invoking his legacy, of the work he has bequeathed to us, we may compel Congressmen sympathetic to the old statesman to more thoroughly consider our policies before they vote."

USA_wfb_64_white_bird_of_peace_desc:0 "Given the choice between total war and a long peace, a rational businessman will always prefer the latter option. While beneficial to defense contractors and weapons manufacturers to an extent, a protracted conflict (or the preparation for one) can birth enough uncertainties of a ruinous and destabilizing nature to the American economy. Additionally, the opportunity costs associated with a large military beggar belief; precious billions of tax dollars for the many vital programs the federal government maintains will instead go to expensive weapons systems for wars increasingly unlikely to come.\n\nKnowing this, President Bennett has decided to rationalize America's defense budget for the rest of his term. While unpopular with the warhawks populating both the NPP and his own party, he believes sensible spending takes precedence over political grandstanding."

Continuing the fight for freedom and liberty abroad will thusly demand our money, manpower and materiel until they have spread to every corner of the globe. President Bennett, of course, welcomes the oathsworn duty of the Free World's mightiest power.\n\nHowever, he has reiterated that he will not entangle the armed forces into counterproductive foreign adventures simply because he can.

Successive years have seen a uniform increase in value without being matched by an increase in consumer purchasing power. Left unchecked, this burgeoning crisis will spiral out of control and into a worse recession.\n\nPresident Bennett, after consulting the matter with his Cabinet, has ordered the Federal Reserve to reduce the flow of money into the economy for the remainder of his term."

As is becoming increasingly common, they now look to the White House for solutions.\n\nThe President's advisors have suggested pegging all OFN currencies to the American dollar. This allows them growth matching our own economy's, and their respective nations some surety over how much their own money is worth. It is a risky proposal, and one which no doubt treads all sorts of sovereignty issues -- but much like the rising tide lifts all boats, so too shall the world's greatest economy shoulder the burden of lifting the Free World to a starry-eyed future."

Free markets have paved the path to enlightenment once, and so shall it pave the path to the future.\n\nAs the champion of freedom, America has the unspoken obligation to encourage free markets wherever and whenever possible.

Without a reliable lender to guarantee them safe loans for to restore or accelerate economic growth, these nations' capabilities to recover from tumultuous circumstances will remain weak and insufficient.\n\nEnter the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank: Two multinational institutions, backed by American economic might, willing and able to offer these very loans to all OFN member states.

USA_wfb_64_political_necessity_desc:0 "Like it or not, we need to deal with this civil rights issue. It was President Nixon's lack of initiative in carrying out needed reform that led to the current crisis, and while the issue stands, it is unlikely America will be able to focus on anything else. Unlike some, however, we are not so keen to just kick the segregationists to the curb. After all, denying them their say will just transfer the wrath of the debate from one side to the other. We need a solution that pleases both sides - or at least one that doesn't upset either side too much."
USA_wfb_64_token_reform:0 "Token Reform"
USA_wfb_64_token_reform_desc:0 "After some deliberation, President Bennett has decided that the best course of action is a modest program of reform. With some new laws to protect the worst injustices against our African American population, we can prove to them that we are listening. We might have to tick off the segregationists a little bit to achieve this, but as long as we toe the line and water down some of the more radical proposals, we can settle this issue without making too many people unhappy."

USA_wfb_64_codified_protections_desc:0 "While there have been efforts in the past to grant rights and liberties to African Americans, lawmakers have time and time again manipulated and creatively interpreted the law to deny them these rights. Our efforts should focus on modifying federal law to legally codify the rights, guarantees and protections granted to these American citizens in a clear, well-defined manner. By closing the legal loopholes used to keep them oppressed, we can ensure that racial minorities are granted the fundamental protections needed to bring them on level with the rest of America."

USA_wfb_64_crack_down_on_resistance_desc:0 "It's time to clear the streets. Protests and riots are still ongoing across the country, and if we are to ensure a civilized debate we must put an end to these constant battlegrounds. We will increase police funding, send them out to round up the worst trouble makers and order the rest of the people home. To avoid accusations of political favouritism, we will crack down on the violence on both sides. If either side wants to be listened to, they need to start acting like adults."
USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection:0 "Voting Station Inspections"
USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection_desc:0 "Voter suppression is a major issue that has been flagged by the civil rights activists. Minorities are often prevented from voting through a myriad of obscure regulations, a confusing registration process and a lack of non-English language materials. We should send out inspectors to certain problem areas to make sure everyone is being offered their democratic rights. This should also make us more popular amongst the civil rights movement without annoying the segregationists too much - after all, we're just enforcing rights people should already be entitled to."
USA_wfb_64_one_great_push:0 "One Great Push"
USA_wfb_64_one_great_push_desc:0 "President Bennett wants the civil rights debate settled as soon as possible. He has gathered the lawmakers together for a marathon session that aims to introduce a rapid fire sequence of laws to vote. He has hopes that if we can get the issue dealt with quickly, we can keep it out of the news cycle for a lengthy period and thus lessen the anger segregationists might feel towards us than if we were to allow the process to drag out. The time for idling is over - let's get this issue sorted once and for all."
USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat:0 "Don't Rock the Boat"
USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat_desc:0 "After some deliberation, President Bennett has decided that the best course of action is to pursue a cautious policy in dealing with the civil rights issue. The concerns of the segregationists cannot be ignored, and to force them to change their ways would be an act of tyranny. We can still offer some basic reforms that will give protections to minority communities, but they might be left wanting. Still, the segregationists do constitute a significant proportion of our voting base, and the needs of the party must be considered."
USA_wfb_64_check_committees:0 "Keep the Committees in Check"
USA_wfb_64_check_committees_desc:0 "Most Americans' experience with legislation as a process begins and ends at the Oval Office, where the President signs Congress-approved bills into law in front of cameras and key allies. What the memoirs and tabloids neglect to mention, perhaps because of their comparative lack of glamor if not scandal, is that these laws have to pass through a whole battery of committees and subcommittees before they even see the light of Capitol Hill. Astute observers would point out this facet of American lawmaking's mind-bogglingly byzantine nature... but for the Beltway's savvy participants, the tedium this presents is a beloved tool to keep the laws they dislike from ever seeing the light of Capitol Hill.\n\nPresident Bennett is aware of the many ways his opponents can utilize this fearsome bureaucratic bludgeon to undermine the passage of his own Civil Rights Act, and plans to make appeals of support to his fellow Republican-Democrats in the appropriate committees."
USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes:0 "Rally Congressional Votes"
USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes_desc:0 "If we are to resolve the civil rights matter, we must secure the support of Congress to pass the necessary legislation. Thanks to both the charisma of President Bennett and the party's balanced position on the matter, it may be possible to rally congressmen from the Republicans, the Center and the Far-Right all at once. This will require some deals to be cut with various factions and interest groups within Congress to get some of the more wavering folks on board, but as long as we promise to push a few of their personal causes forwards a bit it shouldn't be difficult to garner their votes. When we have their support, we will be ready to do what is necessary for the future of the nation."

USA_wfb_64_right_to_free_speech_desc:0 "Freedom of speech is a core pillar of American society. To deny it to anyone, no matter their opinion, is a gross breach of the vision our Founding Fathers had for this country. Both the segregationists and the civil rights activists call each other's words 'reprehensible,' 'disgusting' and 'un-American,' but the truth is that we must allow them both to have a say. We may not like what they have to say, but we shall defend to the death their right to say it - no matter who 'they' are or 'what they have to say' is."

We will promise them things, that we will deliver at some point, as-so-when-there-to-for the opportune opportunity arises. What are those things? When will they be delivered? Don't worry, the government knows what it's doing. The people should not worry themselves, they must understand that we are doing what we can. When we can do it. If we can do it. Maybe."
USA_wfb_64_state_inspections:0 "State Inspections"
USA_wfb_64_state_inspections_desc:0 "The southern states are extremely opposed to any federal oversight in their election process. While it's true that there are aspects of their infrastructure and legislation that are rather unfair to minority communities, we cannot risk looking like federal tyrants and giving more legitimacy to the Far-Right NPP. What we can do is simply encourage the states themselves to examine their own systems, and form investigations on the state level to root out discriminatory practices. Many will argue that this will lead to inevitable bias on the part of the states and nothing will actually change. On the other hand, if any true change is to happen, it must come from below as well as from above."
USA_wfb_64_step_by_step:0 "Step by Step, Bit by Bit"
USA_wfb_64_step_by_step_desc:0 "It is as the old saying goes - 'slow and steady wins the race.' History has shown us that the most successful changes don't happen overnight, but take steady reform over many years to take their desired effect. We can make some progress to make the civil rights people happy while still keeping the segregationists on side. Rather than introducing reforms all at once, we will implement them gradually - this way, conservatives are not shocked by a rapid paradigm shift in our culture, and progressives can rest assured that change is coming, albeit slowly."
USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution:0 "An Acceptable Solution"
USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution_desc:0 "It has taken a lot of careful balancing, but we have devised a strategy which might be palatable to both sides of the civil rights issue. We've taken on board criticism and concerns from both sides of the debate - we may have leaned slightly one way or the other, but it matters not. The point is, we have several bills lined up that should hopefully get most of America on the same page. This includes a range of civil rights legislation that has taken on board both the desires of the civil rights movement as well as the concerns of the segregationists. We can prove that the art of compromise is key in solving America's issues."
USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people:0 "The Voices of the People"
USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people_desc:0 "We can argue about the specifics of what civil rights actually mean all day, but nobody understands what they mean better than those directly affected. All across the country, millions of African Americans and other minorities languish, disenfranchised from the political system. Many of them simply do not bother to engage in politics as a result. If we are to unite America, we should reach out to their communities and get them directly involved in both local and national politics. We can make their voices heard, and allow them to join the conversation."
USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts:0 "Leave it to the Experts"
USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts_desc:0 "State governors and other local politicians are far more suited to deciding policy on the matter of civil rights than federal politicians in Washington. While we can still encourage them to take a more progressive tone on the issue, they should ultimately have the final say on what exact reforms take place. After all, they were voted for by the people of their respective states, so they are clearly qualified to make the important decisions on what is best for their local communities."
USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees:0 "Subcommittees upon Subcommittees"
USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees_desc:0 "American history is replete with instances where laws are applied such that they are not applied at all, yet seem to be applied if observed at a glance. One need look no further than the Reconstruction-era amendments for glaring examples of such -- and painfully relevant ones at that, considering what the President is planning to add to the long and hefty list thereof.\n\nAfter consulting with his advisors and party members in Congress, he has accepted that pursuing civil rights any further will invite more paralysis than the American political system can afford. Capital and goodwill wasted on exchanging old allies for new and controversial stances is capital and goodwill not spent on curtailing America's rampant inflation, or on containing fascism's metastasis in the world's last unblemished patches.\n\nBut neither can he afford to be seen by the public as ignoring the issue wholesale. With this in mind, he turns to the Congressman's second truest friend next to the filibuster: Red tape. If you want the right thing done after trying everything else, to modify a saying..."

USA_wfb_64_leave_door_open_desc:0 "While we have taken a more conservative path on the issue of civil rights than the activists might like, there is no reason why we cannot have more change in the future. As President Bennett has insisted in the past, real change does not happen overnight. Though the government needs to get on to other things, we can keep the discussion going, and encourage those who believe in the cause of civil rights to direct their efforts towards future reforms. This way, we can keep the civil rights movement reasonably content and also prevent the segregationists from feeling alienated."
USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key:0 "Under Lock and Key"
USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key_desc:0 "We should make it clear that, for the foreseeable future at least, the issue of civil rights is settled. We have already devoted far too much time to the issue, and it is time we get on to other more pressing matters of government. The civil rights movement will probably be somewhat upset, but they should at least acknowledge that they are in a better position than they were before. Putting our foot down should also reassure the Dixiecrats that we aren't abandoning them or our own values."
USA_wfb_64_empower_democrats:0 "Empower the Democrats"
USA_wfb_64_empower_democrats_desc:0 "With government policy taking a distinctly conservative turn, President Bennett is now presented with a unique opportunity. Many people are finding their faith in the Democrats - once utterly shattered after the loss of the war - suddenly revived. We have the chance to present ourselves as the new face of the status quo, and finally restore our party to dominance in the American political theatre. We will always be grateful to our Republican partners for ensuring our survival these past two decades, of course. But now it is time for us to return to our place in the sun."
USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms:0 "Clarify Certain Terms"
USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms_desc:0 "The acts we have passed so far, on top of a myriad of other regulations and laws established by previous governments, has left the legislation on the matter of civil rights a confusing mess. This ambiguity has left both segregationists and civil rights activists uncertain of where exactly they stand. Now that we have put the foot down on any further legislation, we should focus our efforts on clarifying the laws that already exist, ensuring all terms are clearly defined and that there is no more room for 'creative interpretations'. All Americans must be able to clearly understand the laws they live under."

USA_wfb_64_sideline_republicans_desc:0 "Some of our Republican partners are reportedly distraught at the path our government is taking, feeling that their liberal values are being ignored. We should gently remind them that it was the corruption and abject failure of the previous Republican-dominated administration that saw them swept from power, and saw us swept into it. They should understand that the people do not want them anymore, so they should step back and let us give America the leadership it deserves. Perhaps, one day, we shall have a Democratic-Republican Party once again..."
USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability:0 "Through Guidance, Stability"
USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability_desc:0 "President Bennett has proven that the Democrats can take the lead in national politics through their calm, conservative manner of governance. While many may clamor for true progress, it is in the interests of all that the stability of the nation be considered first and foremost. The fires of progress must be kept controlled by the guiding hand of tradition, lest the fire set our society aflame. To the good people of the civil rights movement; we know you are not satisfied, but you must be patient, for our society is not quite ready to accept your view just yet. Your time will come, but for the time being, we must keep America steady as she goes."

USA_wfb_64_listen_to_stories_desc:0 "It is a sad reality that segregationists view African Americans as less than people, a concept they have been taught all their lives. While it is unlikely we could convince the most staunch racists of the error of their ways, we could still change the minds of some of the more moderate people. We should encourage the civil rights supporters, especially the African Americans themselves, to speak up about their experiences and how segregation has affected them. By giving them a voice to speak directly to the segregationists, we might be able to change some minds and get most people on board with the reforms we need."
USA_wfb_64_take_the_floor:0 "Take the Floor"
USA_wfb_64_take_the_floor_desc:0 "With our policy direction mostly decided upon, it is time for us to convince the party to support our policy. While we are unlikely to change the minds of those staunchly against us, we can still win over those wavering in the middle who remain ambivalent. By taking the lead in the debates on the Senate floor, we can gain the necessary support we need to see our course through to its conclusion. All we need to do to get people on our side is talk to them."
USA_wfb_64_symbols_of_progress:0 "Symbols of Progress"
USA_wfb_64_symbols_of_progress_desc:0 "We have made significant concessions to the civil rights movement and made efforts to engage minority communities. However, our conservative voter base is beginning to voice unease, feeling that we are beginning to turn away from them. We have done much good, but it is time to put the civil rights issue to bed. We have done more than enough to benefit people, and if we stop now we can avoid upsetting the segregationists any more than they already are."
USA_wfb_64_fine_line:0 "A Fine Line"
USA_wfb_64_fine_line_desc:0 "Our careful balance of both liberal and conservative values has earned us at least muted approval from both sides of the spectrum. True to his word, President Bennett has gone to great lengths to bring all of America under one banner, favoring neither side above the other, while ensuring everyone walks away reasonably happy. Nobody can say they got everything they wanted, but that is the nature of compromise. With our government policy taking a reasonable middle ground, it is highly likely that for the most part, the status quo will be maintained within the halls of power."
USA_wfb_64_real_change:0 "Real Change"
USA_wfb_64_real_change_desc:0 "Though the Democrats are traditionally a party of conservative values, President Bennett and many senior members of the party have been swayed by the arguments of the civil rights movement. We can no longer beat around the bush - in this case, America needs progress if we truly want to be a government for all Americans. While we won't take things as far as some of the other parties are suggesting, we will provide real reform that will guarantee the political rights of African Americans nationwide. The segregationists will not be happy, but we can no longer deny that the current system is unfair and deeply flawed."
USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans:0 "Empower the Republicans"
USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans_desc:0 "Our turn towards more liberal politics has greatly pleased our Republican partners, who are glad we have managed to bring forward progress on the civil rights issue without burning the country down. Our change in direction has confused and outraged some people, however, with many questioning why the Democratic half of the RDs are even necessary if both factions are following the same line of thinking. While this may be damaging for us, President Bennett believes that in this case, we must throw our support behind the policies of the Republican party to make the system work for all Americans."
USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken:0 "A Perfectly Broken System"
USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken_desc:0 "In the past, some have called the union of the Democratic and the Republican party a Frankenstein, an abomination - a traditionally liberal and traditionally conservative party joined at the hip, a coalition too broad and diametrically opposed to work. As President Bennett proves, a consideration of the values of both parties is actually far more beneficial to our nation than simply considering each set of values in isolation. Besides, we've made broad-spectrum politics work far better than the NPP and their constant bickering amongst themselves. In all, the Bennett presidency has made the bond between the Republican-Democrats stronger than ever; even if we have our ups and downs with each other, we have shown we can work together for the betterment of all."
USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity:0 "Through Fellowship, Unity"
USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity_desc:0 "The one thing President Bennett has not compromised on is his willingness to compromise. Never once doubting that meaningful change can be achieved while still respecting those who value tradition, he has ensured that all aspects of our society are represented, proving himself the true master of compromise. There is always more room for changes and alterations in the future, but with all parties reasonably satisfied, we can save those future discussions for another day. Segregationists, civil rights activists, people and politicians - we are all Americans, and now we can step forwards to face the issues of the day together."
USA_wfb_64_sideline_democrats:0 "Sideline the Democrats"
USA_wfb_64_sideline_democrats_desc:0 "In the interests of pursuing what is right for America, we must unfortunately concede that we have lost a lot of support with our conservative voting base. Segregationists accuse us of selling out to the civil rights movement, and recent polls suggest that we will lose a significant number of votes in the next election as a result of our shift away from traditional conservatism. Though progressives have come to respect us for our acceptance of their concerns, most are likely to continue voting for either the Republicans or the Center-NPP, parties more recognizably aligned with their values. Some call our new course political suicide. Maybe it is. But at least at the end of the day, we can say we put the needs of the country over the needs of the party."
USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act:0 "A Voting Rights Act"
USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act_desc:0 "Lyndon B. Johnson, senate leader for the Republicans, has taken the floor with the support of various figures from his party faction to propose a Voting Rights Act. This act would go a step further than the protections we have implemented thus far, and guarantee the political and voting rights of African Americans and other minorities on the federal level. With progressive values beginning to win out across both the Republicans and the Democrats, it would make little sense to oppose this new bill, which would cement our support with the civil rights movement. However, many within our party fear this would be seen as a grave transgression by the segregationists, and that we will likely lose a lot of support in the south for allowing this to go through."
USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress:0 "Through Change, Progress"
USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress_desc:0 "We are conservatives; that much has not changed, but to fail to let other ideas be heard and take root when the nation so clearly needs them is the height of bullheadedness. We understand that our traditional voters may not agree, but it is our duty to represent all Americans, not just those who tick our box at the polls. By guaranteeing true unalienable rights for everyone, we ensure that the nation can truly work together as one entity. To the segregationists; we understand we have disappointed you, but know that we will continue to represent you in all other aspects. Even the seasons change, and for the sake of our country, so too must America."

Nary a year ago streets all across our nation echoed with the yells of progressives and segregationists crying fury in each other's faces, seeing each other not as fellow Americans but as enemies. The issue threatened to tear apart the very fabric of America. Now, the streets are mostly quiet. Those once bellicose protesters and furious statesmen have either celebrated the dawn of a new day, or accepted that the world has moved past their squabbles. Even if some are still upset, President Bennett has successfully secured the continued stability of American society."

USA_wfb_64_we_are_stronger_desc:0 "We can call the issue of civil rights resolved, at least for now. Any further legislation on the matter can be handled in a calm, rational manner over time, as our great political system always allowed for. With the main source of consternation in our nation quelled, we can finally present ourselves as a strong, united force against all the darkness of the world. Unlike in Japan or Germany, we Americans handle our issues with dignity, lawfulness and common ground, not jackboots and suppression. By setting this example for not only our country, but for all the remaining free nations of the world, we can let humanity know that democracy is still kicking!"

USA_wfb_64_torch_burns_bright_desc:0 "In his wisdom, President Jefferson once said that the tree of liberty must be watered every so often by the blood of patriots. President Bennett was not one for violence -- but he does believe that the torch of human freedom must likewise be fed with kindling and tinder. The intensity of its flames proportions itself accordingly to the quality of its tendered fuel; stronger commitments to like-minded causes create brighter, more beautiful flames.\n\nEight years of hindsight has led the President to appreciate how far it has grown: Once sputtered licks of ember after Watergate, now a blazing inferno after the many reforms of his two terms. At home, the American people now exercise their freedoms under a safe and stable system managed by capable men. Abroad, America's own league of free nations grow by leaps and bounds, bringing life and vigor to ideals besieged by fascist empires..."

Systems are wont to be upended by their own weight in time, and a large enough crisis can knock one over to make room for another, better suited to tackle the present and its issues than the past's. But the weary Utahn allowed himself some satisfaction for making the most out of his Presidency, and thus in bringing about the feats his country can achieve at its greatest.\n\nWallace F. Bennett let out a chuckle as he leaned back against the most prestigious office chair in Washington, D.C. His feet laid atop the Resolute Desk, legs now free to shuffle about a desk void of drafts and memos for the first time in eight years. America can fight its causes without him... but with him, he can deservedly say, it has gained the disposition and the means to fight on for many decades yet.\n\nNot bad for a Mormon office clerk, all things considered."

WFB.2.t:0 "Appointment of Edmund Muskie"
WFB.2.desc:0 "If one were to think of an ideal candidate for Secretary of State, Edmund Muskie... wouldn't be it.  He's reserved, blunt, and relatively inexperienced in foreign affairs.  But with all that said, Muskie has a lot going for him.  If Treasury Secretary Robertson is a reward to President Bennett's conservative backers, Secretary of State Muskie is an olive branch to the liberal wing of the Republican-Democrats.  As Maine's governor, and, subsequently, senator, he's championed civil rights and environmental protections, bringing Maine fully into the 20th century.  Depending on who you ask, he's either the right man to represent America on the world stage, or a lily-livered provincial who's better off sending pork back to Portland.  As one editor wryly put it: "Sending Muskie against the Germans would be like sending a three-toed sloth out to seize turf from a wolverine."\n\n"
WFB.2.a:0 "I guess we'll just have to see."

WFB.3.t:0 "Appointment of Absalom Robertson"
WFB.3.desc:0 ""Absalom, Absalom!" reads more than one witty editorial headline.  With the nomination of Absalom Robertson to the post of Treasury Secretary, the reference to Dixie literature is adroit, but Robertson himself is a serious man.  A scion of Virginia's powerful Byrd Organization, Robertson belongs firmly in the camp of conservative Southern Democrats, adamantly opposed to any sort of integration.  His appointment is surely a sop to President Bennett's supporters in Congress.  But it also has many in the opposition worried.  The Treasury Department has a great deal of power over taxes and audits.  What might it do to those who come out against Bennett's agenda, especially with an arch-conservative in the driver's seat?  And then there's that new production company that his son, Pat, is setting up...\n\n"

WFB.4.t:0 "Appointment of Robert McNamara"
WFB.4.desc:0 "It would be unfair to call Robert Strange McNamara a man of numbers, and numbers alone.  Sure, he made his name as Harvard's youngest professor, and helped save Ford from its postwar fiscal chaos.  But McNamara has his fair share of ideology.  In contrast to those who call for the razing of Japan or German Africa, he wants the Pentagon to take a more measured approach.  Fewer first-strike capabilities, and more deterrence.  Fewer rigid doctrines, and more counterinsurgency.  To his supporters in Congress, McNamara is a man who will shake things up, rationalizing the business of war in a new era of conflict.  The question remains, though: will he truly change the Pentagon, or will his efforts get bogged down in the old system?\n\n"

WFB.51.desc:0 "With silver reserves at all-time lows, the metallic backing system that supports America's currency is in crisis.  While the Bennett White House begins to push their legislative reform plan, Treasury Secretary Robertson has already directed the U.S. Mint to take a variety of stopgap measures.  By halting the production of a number of denominations, the hope is that the decline in silver reserves will begin to stabilize.  After all, we can't afford to be profligate at times like this!\n\n"

First, he had been shown some of the hard-working men and women (well, one woman, anyway) who designed anti-counterfeiting markers.  His bureaucrat guides then showed off the vast quantities of ink, paper, and machinery that, when combined, created one of the world's most important currencies.  One of the guides brought out a new five-dollar bill, and offered it to Robertson.  He obligingly held it up for the UPI cameraman, smiling as the paper Abe Lincoln grimaced.\n\n"

WFB.54.t:0 "Passage of the Silver Purchase Act of [GetYear]"
WFB.54.desc:0 "Today, the Silver Act passed both houses of Congress with moderate fanfare. In spite of some reservations about the economic impact of the act, it passed with a significant majority. This act has mostly been a part of a larger move away from silver as a currency-backing metal in favor of other options, notably gold.\n\nMore a removal of past legislation than anything, the act includes multiple provisions geared toward a decrease in silver backing. The most major among these directives is the repeal of the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, which effectively subsidized and encouraged silver mining to unnatural levels. The act also allowed for the production of $1 and $2 Federal Reserve notes to keep up with a changing economy.\n\nLawmakers hope the act will prove successful. The repeal of the Silver Purchase Act will prevent rampant overspending on silver by the Treasury, and hopefully increase fiscal responsibility in general. Concerns over the passage have been minimal, and many are greatly relieved by the move toward a more simplified and robust currency."

The so-called Vancouver Round, which was intended to finalize a number of concessions, led to the repeal of numerous tariffs and trade regulations by countries in the Organization of Free Nations, as well as a number of neutral states. Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, who was present at the signing, hailed the GATT. At the ceremony, he stated: "This agreement will not just encourage trade among free peoples. It will also encourage liberty around the world.

The Democratic wing of the coalition has sided with pro-segregation southern states, citing states' rights as an argument to allow for the preservation of the system. This has led to intense conflict with the Republican wing, which sees the enforcement of civil rights as necessary to securing freedom for all Americans. Still others have taken a middle-of-the-road stance and advocated for compromise wherever possible to prevent the complete separation of both parties.\n\nDepending on the route we take for this issue, there can and will be severe consequences to the unity of the party. Regardless of the outcome, far-right and far-left factions of the National Progressive Party will inevitably use the ordeal as a power play to gain votes from disillusioned politicians.

To continue to let our nation be a beacon of freedom and progress. Let the United States be the city upon the hill once more. I ask you, America, to pass the Civil Rights bill. I ask you to build a better tomorrow, today."\n\nThe crowd was silent for a moment, taking in the President's words, before breaking out into a furious applause. From his podium, overseeing the masses, Wallace F. Bennett smiled warmly. The public seemed to be on his side."

WFB.106.desc:0 "Today, in what is now being called the Columbia Conference, leaders of both the R-D's and the largely-NPP Dixiecrats met in Columbia, South Carolina, to hammer out a Civil Rights bill that both parties find tolerable. Attendees include President Wallace F. Bennett, Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Senator Strom Thurmond. This comes as welcome news to many, as it gives hope that some form of Civil Rights legislation may be passed. To some others, however, this is dreadful news, as they fear that the Dixiecrats will stymie any real change.\n\nPresident Bennett and Strom Thurmond were seen shaking hands in front of the South Carolina State House, surrounded by dozens of politicians, reporters, and security guards. The two men and their respective parties appear to be willing to make a deal, but only time will tell."

Bennett came to an amicable agreement, with the Dixiecrats making great concessions to the R-D's and their Civil Rights bill. President Bennett stated to reporters, "This is a fine day for democracy, and for the people of the United States. I am overjoyed that a good agreement was reached with Senator Thurmond and his voting bloc."\n\nIn the coming weeks, the amended Civil Rights bill is expected to sweep both houses of Congress without much issue. Some of the more hardline Dixiecrats are up in arms over the unexpected amount of concessions that were made, but overall, both parties came out of the Columbia Conference in high spirits."

WFB.108.t:0 "Okay Compromise"
WFB.108.desc:0 "Today, in an unsurprising turn of events, Strom Thurmond and President Wallace F. Bennett came to a rough and grudging agreement, with the Dixiecrats only willing to make minor concessions to the R-D's and their Civil Rights bill. More than half of the Dixiecrats at the Columbia Conference simply walked out, refusing to concede at all. President Bennett stated to reporters, "This is a fine day for democracy, and for the people of the United States. I am overjoyed that an agreement was reached that will allow the bill to go forward."\n\nTo the dismay of many, the new Civil Rights bill is far weaker than before, as the R-D's made sacrifices to gain the paltry support of only a few Southerners. In the coming weeks, the greatly amended bill is expected to barely struggle through Congress, with just enough votes to be passed. Overall, the new bill is proving to be a very divisive issue, with both parties coming out of the affair somewhat displeased."

WFB.109.desc:0 "America is gripped by uncertainty, as news from Columbia spreads across the nation like a shadow; the Columbia Conference has failed. Over the past week, politicians from across the nation debated in the South Carolina State House over compromises on President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill. Unfortunately, the Dixiecrats could not come to terms with the R-D's and the President, and thus, the bill has not been amended and is unlikely to receive the required votes to be passed into law.\n\nPresident Bennett, leaving the Columbia Conference, said that he was disappointed that agreement could not be found, but was confident that the bill would pass regardless. \n\nThe failure of the Columbia Conference has come as a shock to some, and an unfortunate inevitability to others. The future of President Bennett's Civil Rights bill is now in question, and with it, America's future."

WFB.110.desc:0 "After President Bennett's speech in Washington, D.C., in which he publicly requested to meet with Dixiecrat leaders to hammer out a compromise, many expected the Dixiecrats to at least make a show of being cooperative. Unfortunately, it appears their stubborn nature knows no bounds, as Strom Thurmond, with his voting caucus firmly behind him, have unequivocally refused to meet with the President. "No Civil Rights," said Senator Thurmond, "not today, nor tomorrow, nor in a century."\n\nAs the country once again holds its breath over the incredibly divisive upcoming vote on the bill, President Bennett has yet to comment on this unfortunate turn of events. Rather than create a more tense situation by berating the Dixiecrats, the President seems content to hold his breath and seek greener pastures."
WFB.110.a:0 "Let's hope that he can pull it off without them."

WFB.111.t:0 "New Allies"
WFB.111.desc:0 "As the Dixiecrats refused to cooperate, President Bennett has been forced to find another way to pass his Civil Rights bill. Currently, the President and his R-D allies are looking for friends among the left and center leaning NPP congressmen. In addition, some of the fence-sitting Democrats in the R-D's are likely candidates for recruitment into Bennett's new voting group. Today, President Bennett and Senator Lyndon Johnson are meeting with several members of these groups, most notably the C-NPP's Robert F. Kennedy, attempting to swing them over to the side of Civil Rights. As of right now, however, these alliances are just beginning to take shape, and whether or not they will actually be able to pass the bill remains to be seen. With the day Congress votes on the bill growing closer, one wonders if the President will be able to form these alliances in time."

WFB.112.t:0 "Alliances to Ashes"
WFB.112.desc:0 "After meeting with several influential C-NPP congressmen, as well as a few Democrats, President Bennett and his pro-Civil Rights Caucus have come up empty handed. While somewhat expected, considering the rushed nature of the alliances in question, it is still another setback for the President. With no potential new proponents of his bill, Bennett is left in an awkward position; he must put forth a bill he knows will fail.\n\nPresident Bennett has yet to comment on these failed compromises and failed alliances, only responding that "We'll get the bill passed, don't you worry about that.""
WFB.112.a:0 "Will he now?"


WFB.113.t:0 "New Friends in Old Places"
WFB.113.desc:0 "Everything is complete: the alliances have been made. After some debate and deliberation, the majority of the C-NPP and R-D fence sitters have joined the voting caucus for President Bennett's Civil Rights bill. Assuming everything goes to plan, the bill should be able to sweep both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was no simple matter to convince some left-leaning members of the C-NPP to vote for the bill. Influential figures in the party, such as Michael Harrington, found the bill fell short of true social equality, and believed that, were it passed, there would be no more political will for further Civil Rights legislation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, many fence-sitting, old-fashioned Democrats feared that the bill was perhaps too ambitious. Balancing these two groups proved to be an immense challenge; the bill would not pass without their support. Despite some setbacks, the President and Senator Lyndon Johnson were able to convince them to throw their lot in with the bill.\n\nNo official announcement regarding the alliance has been made, and likely never will. Word spreads fast of changing loyalties, however, and the lips of politics are the loosest in existence. No doubt Strom Thurmond and his Dixiecrat caucus already know of the success of Bennett's gamble, and it no doubt terrifies them."

WFB.114.t:0 "The Comprehensive Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.114.desc:0 "Today, in a surprising announcement, President Bennett's liberal Civil Rights bill has been passed, with possibly the most significant legal protection for non-whites since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. It includes comprehensive protections for voting rights, forbidding state-mandated "literacy tests" targeted at African Americans. It also includes timetables for the total desegregation of American society, demanding that all Jim Crow laws and other race-based legislation be repealed within four months. Most importantly, however, it forbids the discrimination of employment on race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\nMany are surprised that such an all-encompassing, liberal Civil Rights bill was even passed in the first place. In the weeks leading up to the voting on the bill, there was quite a scramble in the R-D's, as President Bennett and his allies struggled to gather the votes. In the end, however, it appears the President was able to get the bill passed, with no compromises on the rights and freedoms of minorities."
WFB.114.a:0 "Impressive."

WFB.115.t:0 "The Moderate Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.115.desc:0 "Today, President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill successfully achieved a majority of votes in both the House and the Senate, with the President soon to sign it into law. The bill, while less comprehensive than some might have hoped, is still one of the largest steps towards total equality between Americans since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. The bill includes federal protections for voting rights, prohibiting "literacy tests" and other such fraudulent measures at the state level intended to disenfranchise minorities from voting. It also includes the prohibition of discriminatory employment based on race, color, religion, etc.\n\nMany more liberal-minded citizens are dissatisfied with how the bill has turned out, however. The bill was originally much more liberal and comprehensive, with far greater protection of the rights of minorities. Due to the need to compromise with Conservative politicians in Washington, several of these protections were loosened or simply removed entirely. Despite this, the majority of people across the nation are simply pleased that any Civil Rights legislation was passed at all."
WFB.115.a:0 "Not quite as good as was hoped for, but still good."

WFB.116.t:0 "The Conservative Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.116.desc:0 "After months of deliberation, compromise, and voting, President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill has finally been passed by both houses of Congress and is likely to be signed into law in the coming weeks. The once highly liberal Civil Rights Act has now been effectively neutered by the more conservative elements in Washington. All provisions for voting protection against minority disenfranchisement have been removed, and only moderate prohibition of discriminatory employment practices. In addition, greatly encompassing exceptions have been added to the bill, dictating that in certain circumstances, minority protections need not be enforced.\n\nOverall, the bill has drawn a vast amount of criticism from the more liberal-minded politicians in Washington, with many deeming it ineffectual. While conservatives across the country are pleased with the outcome, Bennett's Civil Rights legislation is quickly proving unpopular with the general public."
WFB.116.a:0 "Disappointing, though not unexpected."

WFB.117.t:0 "Dixiecrats Pleased"
WFB.117.desc:0 "After President Bennett's recent passing of an unexpectedly conservative Civil Rights bill, the Dixiecrats are unsurprisingly pleased. In a recent televised statement, Strom Thurmond, Senator from South Carolina and avid Civil Rights opponent, expressed his "gratitude" that "clear heads prevailed in the Capitol." \n\nOverall, however, this is simply a bad look for the President and the R-D's. The overt support of the Dixiecrats means the Civil Rights bill appears less genuine to the public, and thus Bennett appears less concerned with the people, and more with getting what he wants.\n\nIn a recent press conference, when questioned over this turn of events and whether or not his administration is becoming more conservative, the President had this to say: \n\n"I am still the man I am when I took office. My opinions are my own and have not changed. The Southern voting caucus being pleased with my actions is not a consequence of changing allegiance on my part. Rather, it is a consequence of certain agreements between us, which, I assure you, have always existed.""

Many voters back in their home states, who elected them for liberal policies, are quite dissatisfied with their acceptance and support of such a conservative piece of legislation. Consequently, should even more conservative action be taken in the future, the Liberals face a serious threat of losing re-election.\n\nUnderstandably, many liberal congressmen are afraid that they may be replaced. In response, they have begun to rally and take a larger role in legislating. In addition, they are quite upset with President Bennett for threatening the fabric of the R-D's as a whole. Should they be faced with voting for another conservative bill, it is unlikely that they will follow the President's lead, instead doing everything in their power to halt its passing."

Investigations by the FBI and other agencies have determined that these claims are false and that no violations of the 15th Amendment have occurred. \n\nAlready, these investigations have drawn massive criticism from liberal and progressive elements across the country. The groups claim that these inquiries are fraudulent, corrupt, or insufficient. As far as the federal government is concerned, however, these claims are unsubstantiated, and no legislation prohibiting state-level voting regulations is likely to be passed."

Today, Senator Robert F. Kennedy met with Bennett at the White House, planning to come to terms with his more right-wing legislation. Overall, this has had a positive effect on the prospective bill, and things are looking up for Bennett and the R-D's in their pursuit of Civil Rights.\n\nThis turn of events was rather unexpected by many third-party observers, as the President's speech, while well worded, did nothing to alleviate the complaints and fears of the Progressives in Congress regarding the Civil Rights bill. This may hint that Robert F. Kennedy and his voting bloc are less united than previously understood. In any case, they are now behind the bill, if only just. Now, all that is left is the vote: one to decide the future of America."

This support has failed to materialize, however, and the R-D's and their few Dixiecrat allies are still lacking in votes. The President continues to call for the progressives to 'restore national brotherhood' and 'follow a path that is acceptable to all Americans.'\n\nThe progressives under Senator Robert F. Kennedy are standing firm. Almost all of the C-NPP has turned down Bennett's call for 'unity'. Rallied behind Kennedy, they believe that the bill will simply dampen support for Civil Rights legislation among the general public, while doing the bare minimum in actually achieving racial equality. Without their help, the R-D's will likely be forced to return to the drawing board to create legislation that the progressives find more amicable."

The party's Senate and House whips have been working around the clock to bully, bribe, or otherwise coerce fence-sitters into throwing in their hat with Bennett's Civil Rights bill. As of this moment, the votes are close, and it appears that when voting day comes, a select few congressmen will decide the bill's future.\n\nShould the R-D's fail to gather sufficient support, it is likely that they will be forced to cancel the vote and re-draft the bill to be more left-leaning. If this occurs, it is possible that they will be caught in a catch-22; if they change the bill to be more liberal, they will lose conservatives, but if they don't, they'll lose the progressives."

While no transcript of the meeting has been released, it is more than likely that its purpose was to discuss possible progressive support for the Civil Rights bill.\n\nAlready suspecting that their compromises with the R-D's will be violated in favor of the progressives, the conservatives advocating the bill are beginning to withdraw their support. It seems that the President has caught himself in a tight spot, in which he cannot pass the bill without the support of both groups, but will lose the support of one by compromising with the other.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the bill is likely to be re-drafted in a much more progressive fashion than before.

In particular, they complain about one of the bill's central clauses: that states cannot administer tests to determine voter eligibility. This clause was specifically targeted at southern states who administered 'literacy' tests that were nigh-impossible to pass for African-Americans, voiding their right to vote.\n\nObviously, these state-sponsored tests were in violation of the 15th Amendment, and thus illegal under federal law. Despite this, the Dixiecrats under Strom Thurmond believe that the tests were fair, simple, and non-discriminatory. The tests are now illegal, but the Dixiecrats will whine and complain until history passes them by."

"Good evening to those attending tonight's event, as well as any who may be watching from across our country. Tonight, I stand alongside my fellow Democrats to turn yet another page in the whirling twists and turns of the history of the United States. For centuries, many regarded African-Americans as commodities to be used and traded, even igniting a conflict which tore our nation asunder." \n\nIt seemed as if the air had been sucked out from the hall. Was the President about to defend the segregationists, or punch them in the gut? "Regretfully, we continue to witness injustices, with African-Americans suffering social, political, and economic wrongs at every level of society. While my fellow Democrats and I adhere to tradition and conservatism, this is by no means justification, or approval of, the prejudices faced by African-American citizens today. It is shameful that some continue to stand against the average American based on the color of their skin. The administration will work to end these wrongs, once and for all.""

Of course, monetary resources have been poured into the project to secure the most reliable and efficient system to aid our alliance members' financial status, with President Bennett declaring that the conference will "secure the world economy against the iron grip of Fascism." \n\nBennett has promised the agreement will promote economic prosperity among the OFN's members, allocating resources among one another rather than reaching out to the more nefarious members of the international market. Whispers of the creation of a World Bank circulate widely among those present, in order safeguard each other from financial failures to ensure that exploitation by rival powers does not occur. With such a system in place, the OFN would create a new means to prospering economically. \n\nHowever, the scope of the agreement has led to some apprehension. National resources would be diverted in order to comply with the terms of the agreement, a pooling of funds to cover the mistakes of other OFN members. Refusing the agreement would not doom us to be exiled from the OFN; rather, it would just mean a restriction on some of Bennett's more extensive plans for the organization."

In past weeks, stories of police brutality on protesting African Americans had been modified to a slight degree. These stories were then published in official R-D media, including a particularly sad story a few hours ago: the killing of a black teenager during a race riot in Charleston. The story was slightly altered such that the teen was simply trying to get through the crowd. In actual fact, the police report claims he assaulted a police officer. It was just a touch of hyperbole.\n\nA knock came at the door. "Come in," the President said.\n\nA tall, thin man in a dark suit walked in, holding a notebook. "Ah, James," Bennett said warmly, "what can I do for you?"\n\n"Well, it's about the recent stories you and your party have been propagating."\n\nBennett shrugged. "What about them?"\n\n"They're false. Objectively so. Sooner or later, news about these falsifications will get out, and it might actually hurt us in the long run."\n\n"No, it won't.

President Bennett, as much as it pains him, believes that if total desegregation were to occur immediately, it would be an utter disaster. To alleviate this issue while still achieving some civil rights for all, the President has devised a plan: to mire the application of the bill in bureaucracy.\n\nA series of committees and subcommittees will be created nationwide to determine how exactly to apply the new legislation in their assigned communities. Their decision will then be reviewed by a higher authority, and then accepted and implemented.\n\nJust today, the first step towards building these committees and bureaucratic systems was taken, with the swearing-in of the first members of the Federal Committee for Civil Rights Implementation. Headed by a bipartisan group of politicians, it will function as the main oversight board for Civil Rights across the nation. President Bennett has called it "a momentous occasion in the history of our country: the first step towards racial equality.""

Pro-civil rights groups have already come out in celebration, emboldened by the president's support in their efforts to advocate 'freedom for all Americans' while more conservative sects have been quick to denounce these 'tyrannical measures.'\n\nSince its creation in the mid-1800s, the Republican party has argued for the rights of African-Americans, and the support of the level-headed and pragmatic Bennett has only encouraged them to pursue this agenda. Firmly believing that the time has come for equality before the law in the United States, Republican politicians have now proposed various laws that would extend political and social equality to all Americans. The proposed Voting Rights Act, which would grant universal suffrage to citizens regardless of race, is the first of many measures to achieve these goals. The passage of these acts will be hotly contested but hopefully assured.\n\nThe effects of this decision on the two-party coalition have yet to be seen, but projections do not look good. Many Southern Dixiecrats feel betrayed by this sudden change of course, and, in the confusion, may be swayed to factions that better represent their constituents. The social upheaval of these measures will also surely have long-lasting effects on the nation."

The effects of this decision will surely be felt for years to come, both in policy and in the makeup of the already-weakened coalition.\n\nSo far, Democrats have taken an entirely conservative stance in the Civil Rights debate, arguing against provisions to outlaw race-based discrimination. Their newfound dominance in Congress will favor the status quo in segregationist states, leaving voting rights and other hotly contested topics to their discretion. How this will affect any previous civil rights legislation is uncertain.\n\nThe uneasy alliance between the liberal and conservative wings of the coalition is now in doubt, as many Republicans have been quick to denounce the party establishment. In the wake of these divisions, the NPP may find support from these politicians as well. Regardless, it seems the segregationist institutions of the South have gotten a new lease on life."

In the months since then, the Democrats have been rapidly waning in power. The R-D's have always been mainly Republicans, but the two groups were generally seen as equals. Now, after months of declining support, the Democrats are the shadow party: they are the second among equals. From this point onward, they, and their viewpoints, are on the way out.\n\nNo official statement has been made regarding this political shift, but its effects are already evident; more than 5 Democratic congressmen have announced they are switching to the NPP.

The bill, to the dismay of many Republicans, was very conservative and lacked strong clauses regarding enforcement. Consequently, almost 30% of the traditionally liberal Republicans voted against the bill.\n\nThe general public, however, appears to have sided with the Democrats, as the bill was praised by all but the most fanatic of activists. Over the months since the bill's passing, the Republicans have been waning in power, and lack strong direction. The group is splintering over issues of whether or not to pursue further Civil Rights legislation and whether to continue working with the Democrats. Meanwhile, the Democrats, traditionally playing second-fiddle to the Republicans, have taken charge. They now effectively control the R-D's as a whole.\n\nWhile the political shift isn't really official, its effects are already evident; more than 5 Republican congressmen have switched over to the C-NPP, tired of their party's lethargy and Democratic control. In the coming months, it is likely that more will follow, and with them, the liberal side of the R-D's."

In a heartfelt plea to members of both wings of the party, Bennett called for 'unity, not division' as they navigate the issue to find an agreeable solution. Also included in his speech was a warning to avoid 'political extremes,' stressing that the best solutions come from discussion, not partisan division. While withholding outright endorsement for either course of action, he has also suggested the possibility for compromise, but the form that would take was left unspecified. "Either way," he said, "we must stay true to our American values, not those of extremists.""

Robertson replied, before taking a seat across from the President. \n\n"Well with regards to the federal grants for Wisconsin, I believe that -" Bennett began, before a heaving set of wet coughs derailed the conversation. \n\nRobertson looked nervously at President Bennett as he rocked in his chair, the President's face darkening as the violent coughing spell continued. After what seemed like an eternity, President Bennett managed to regain his composure, even as the world spun gently. His mind raced; he had never dealt with such a coughing fit before.

But he could not escape the fact, were he to expire in office, his staff needed to know what to do. America was a constantly changing and shifting country, and strong leadership would be needed to keep it grounded in safety, security, and just sanity. \n\nAfter a long walk which had, frankly, failed to clear the President's mind, the sight of Frances Bennett, First Lady of the United States, was a welcome sight. "Well, it's a rare sight to see you out of the office! How are you doing?" Frances Bennett said, offering her husband a kiss. \n\n"Well, I wanted to - well, I -" the President said, before a thunderous set of coughs wracked his pale frame, leaving him in his wife's embrace as she called for the staff, with Vice President Ford rushing from his office to support the faltering President."

And every evening, the family prayed before dinner. It was the only respite between the paperwork and phone calls that the President still handled, despite explicit orders to rest. \n\n"Yes, Ford, exactly, we need to stick Muskie and Robertson together to deal with the Australian work." The President exploded into a fit of wheezing, clutching himself, as he listened to the questions of the Vice President. "The South?

First and foremost, the Bennett administration wants to make one thing clear: we have not abandoned you. We know that many of you have worries and woes that must be addressed.

"Absalom figured he understood the situation with the budget and found the best solution with the expenses of the South: a flat cut for agricultural development and pre-established agricultural production zones." \n\nBennett was stunned. A complete slash, across the board, of funding for the self-owned farmers in the South, some of the most loyal Democrats in the nation? Some of whom were already considering backing away from the Democrats after seeing what Ford had to say on national television? \n\n"Ford, why was this allowed to go through?

"You know as well as I do that we're not going to sign onto anything that's going to pad people's wallets, only to burn it away with inflation in a year." \n\n"Of course, but we're only proposing to prevent the further depletion of the money supply. And any introduction of an expanded monetary base will be gradual, so the populace has plenty of time to adjust." Bennett had his answer ready. If this was the best argument the Center had, this would be an easy conversation. \n\n"I'm trying to bring you on board so that we can all go home to our districts and say we've done something for the average American, Scoop."

This bill is all about putting more on the table for the average American - I thought the Center would be all over this kind of legislation." President Bennett exclaimed. "I know you, Scoop. You'd support me on this on any other day, so why're you backing out now?" \n\nSenator Jackson winced. "Mr. President, I would. But we've all got to stand for something. I wouldn't have left the R-Ds otherwise, and right now, the NPP is still hopping mad about Nixon and his moves on civil rights. I can't give you cover for this, I'm sorry." \n\n"What, with the next elections around the corner?" Bennett stated. "What a shame it's come to this, Scoop.

The miners are, ah, a little upset by the commercial aspect of the silver trade, and they're not exactly convinced that the new weapons are helping them," Holt said. "Labor's started to pick up on the issue, saying that Australia's getting shortchanged, and my backbenchers are getting nervous. They want market pricing." \n\n"So let's say I did you a favor and gave you market price. The whole point of this was to build up the reserves so we can lend more money to the OFN.

Already, the North was raising a ruckus about 'Bennett's Jim Crow,' as Michael Harrington had argued a few days earlier. But much of the rest of the country seemed at peace - though he imagined that there would be some restiveness in the South once the Department of Justice sent its people to hold its non-binding consultations with state authorities. America, exhausted after years of turmoil, had seemed ready to put the matter to sleep. \n\n'What does our soothed conscience in Washington mean for the African-American?' President Bennett recalled Robert Kennedy's scathing words in the press, following the Senate vote. He was troubled, of course. In the face of America's most trying political crisis since the Civil War, who wouldn't be afraid that they hadn't done enough? \n\nHe looked at the image of Jesus on the cross. Bennett was a faithful man, and this - this Act was what he could be comfortable with. Never mind Thomas Monson; this was a matter for Bennett alone, a dilemma shared by any man of faith in office. Bennett had been true to himself, and that would have to be enough for America."

USA_sen_bill.3.d:0 "The Bennett administration has worked relentlessly on the scrutinizing reviews regarding the Silver Act. The President has collaborated with a multitude of secretaries within the upper levels of the West Wing to finalize the bill. Vice President Ford has declared that the bill's passage has become "one of the most prioritized plans of the Bennett administration in an effort to aid the American economy." \n\nBennett leads the charge to rouse the Democrats to action, driving them to support his plan to place the American economy into a more stable position by transferring the currency-backed metal to that of gold, which is now far more reliable than industrial silver as a store of value. One of the most important details of the Silver Act would be the repeal of the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, which would level off the focus on silver mining and "promote fiscal responsibility within the government," as quoted by Treasurer Absalom Robertson.\n\nHowever, while the bill appears to be siding towards approval within Congress, there are those within the United States that would seek the bill's failure. Many spurned southern Democrats who have turned to the NPP's Far Right find the bill to be distasteful, hurting current silver miners. Likewise, in an odd coalition, the Center branch of the NPP has outspoken members standing against the bill, claiming that it will hurt American jobs. All that's left is to see whether the bill will survive the battleground of the Congress."

The Silver Act's passage proves the potential of the hardworking advisors and officials who managed to construct the piece of legislation after months of hard work within the West Wing, the Treasury, and those outside of D.C. \n\nPresident Bennett himself commented on the bill's passage this evening, declaring it a "crowning achievement of both unity and potential for the United States of America, and a step forward for a new era of economic success." Multiple figures in Bennett's administration, including Treasurer Absalom Robertson, have echoed President Bennett's enthusiasm, stating that "the silver system served to bog the United States down in an outdated system, while the gold system will allow us to continue to show American economic strength worldwide." Republicans and Democrats applauded each other for their bipartisan cooperation towards the bill's success. \n\nOn the other side of the aisle, NPP senators and representatives appear rather quiet over the outcome of the Silver Act. While some hail the success of the bill alongside the R-D's, others exchange confused glances over the ease of the bill's passage. For now, however, the United States takes the first steps towards adopting gold to back the dollar."

Throughout the Senate and House of Representatives, Republican and Democratic congressmen continuously shake their heads, grimace, and express their frustrations over the Silver Act being defeated by political chicanery. Administration officials stated that "the administration will continue its efforts to aid the American economy, despite the evident political hurdles to even the most basic of tasks." \n\nOn the other hand, NPP congressmen have related surprise over their success on the legislative floor. Far Right and Center NPP congressmen shake hands and congratulate one another in the Capitol, while R-D legislators field angry calls from their voting base.

WFB.556.desc:0 "Good morning, Senators, I appreciate your diligence in making it out here to work this early. Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss." With the President's words, the Republicans sat down across from the President's desk. "Gentlemen, the anxieties revolving around the Silver Act's upcoming vote could lead to a complete collapse of support. As President, I cannot allow factionalism to tear apart our country at the seams; thus, gentlemen, you have all been chosen to head to Chicago to meet with Harrington in C-NPP territory. If we can't patch up the economy by ourselves, then we'll have to extend our hand out to the inner cities. I know things haven't been the best between the Democrats and the Republicans recently, but let's try to smooth all that over, what do you say, gentlemen?" The Senators nodded and quickly left to meet with Harrington himself.\n\nThe city had been bustling with activity, and after waiting around for traffic, the Senators' driver dropped them off at a bustling office building on the corner of Ninth street. Finally, the men found their seat across from the Missourian politician himself, looking as annoyed as he seemed impatient. "Well come on, we're busy all day trying to fix what Bennett and the Democrats couldn't." he asked. While sorting through papers, "Now, what is it that you all need over here?" "Well, Mr. Harrington, the President is looking to propose a deal with you and all of the C-NPP." one Senator said. For the first time in the conversation, Harrington stopped sifting through papers and turned to look at the man. "You're telling me the leader of the Democrats and our nation itself has decided to strike a deal with us? After all the harassment, he finally wants to take a step down and offer us something? Now, please, let me know what the President could try to offer us after all of what we, and the miners of the United States, have had to bear?" After taking a deep breath, one of the Senators spoke up, "Now, I know things have been rough between you and Bennett, but he's offering a direct promise here. He's worried about passing the Silver Act; so, if you choose to get your branch to favor the bill, President Bennett has offered a clause which would ensure the jobs of silver miners across the United States, along with a firm agreement to allow the R-D's to open up greater communication to the C-NPP." The leader of the C-NPP tapped his fingers across the desk while offering a look of suspicion towards the Republicans. "Tell me, what makes the President so willing to finally work with us?" Harrington said.\n\n"Because to be honest, sir, President Bennett believes that if we don't fix the economy now, no one's going to be able to.""

"Let's face the light here: the Silver Act's vote is creeping up, but the Congress remains polarized, and I fear the worst; so, I'm sending you three down to the Serpent of the South himself, George C. Wallace to guarantee the extra votes. Understood?"\n\nAnd there we were. The room was silent. The three of us were silent. The Governor of Alabama just sat there, quiet, the whole fucking building was just quiet. "Senators, may I ask what you three are doing down here in my office?" he said, as the pouring of whiskey into five separate glasses flowed in front of us. One Senator picked up first, coughing, "Well, sir, the President sent us here to-" "Oh, my apologies, gentlemen, please, the travel must have dried your throats; please, enjoy a drink." He interrupted. "Don't worry, Mr. Governor, I do not drink." I said, shooting me with eyes like daggers. "Now, as I was saying, sir, President Bennett sent us here to discuss the proceedings of the Silver Act coming up, and how we can align our interests for the betterment of the nation." the Senator said. Wallace swiveled his chair to face the man, stating, "Align our interests? Funny little phrase you put together there. Now, what could the President offer that I may want?" The air in the room tightened like a noose around a criminal's throat. "Well, segregation, sir." the younger Senator with the Southern drawl voiced.\n\nWallace turned."So, Bennett's finally ready to ease down on protecting the Afros? Well, you have my attention, gentlemen. Go on." the Governor asked with a wicked smirk and unending stare. "Well," I finally spoke up, "the President would be glad to have your support, as well as the FR-NPP's support of the terms of the Silver Act. In exchange, he'll look into delaying the work towards Civil Rights legislation." The room stood silent, and still as Wallace's face twisted with contemplation. Suddenly, the room exploded with the slamming of the Governor's fist onto the desk, succeeded by a fierce cackling. "Well, gentlemen, you can go tell Bennett that Governor Wallace shall be considering his proposal to rectify relations with the NPP and the Democrats. For now, however." He stopped short, clearing his throat. "A toast, to the people of the United States." I shakily led our side of the toast and downed the liquor before leaving."

A meeting regarding the extent of the bill was scheduled for today with some key Republican Congressmen. \n\nThe three Republicans walked into the room, greeting President Bennett with a row of shining smiles, failing to put Bennett at ease. The congressmen's outspokenness over the Voting Rights Act has given Bennett a good idea of what this meeting would turn into, and they didn't disappoint. \n\n"Mr. President," their leader said, "the discussion over the upcoming Voting Rights Act has us anxious. My colleagues and I do not believe the bill reaches far enough in the protections offered to African-Americans." \n\n"My administration has been working tirelessly to ensure a passable and effective bill. Isn't it necessary to make sure that the bill can survive the Congress in the first place?" Bennett responded. \n\n"A bill that commits to only one or two changes, outside of a ban against poll taxes, won't come remotely close to settling the injustices that African-Americans face in American society." \n\nThe hours went on, voices were raised, and the breaks grew longer as the shadows crept into the Oval Office."

President Bennett declared that the Voting Rights Act "stands as a long-overdue step to address one of the most bitter injustices in American history." \n\nWhile the administration regards the passage of the bill as a rousing success, African-Americans across the country reported mixed emotions over the bill. As one African-American woman in Atlanta related, " President Bennett's taken a larger step forward than anyone else regarding civil rights, but we've all been here before, with empty words and nothing to show for it." \n\nMany in the nation, however, are relieved with President Bennett's success, figuring that if more issues arise, they can be handled in due time.

For African-Americans, the President and his administration are a rare light of hope in a Democratic party that has more often sided with the status quo, with one man praising the President for "stepping past his political leanings to serve the people." \n\nHowever, many Southern Democrats have publicly criticized the bill for "overstepping the States' rights to make decisions for themselves." Furthermore, the Far Right branch of the NPP has sided with the Southern Democrats, claiming that the law is "an act of tyranny by the federal Government."

##GOLDWATER

POLITICS_GLD_DESC:0 ""A Christian, a Jew, a pilot and a senator walked into a bar in DC. 'What can I get you, Mr. Goldwater?' asked the tender." Thus goes one of the jokes Barry Morris Goldwater tells about himself, and it reflects the complicated and colorful background of the man dominating the Southern and Western wings of the R-D Party. Born in the Arizona Territory to a Jewish father and Episcopalian mother who ran a department store together, the young Goldwater lived an unremarkable life until the outbreak of the Second World War, when he would become a reserve officer in the USAAF, and a pilot with the Ferry Command.\n\nMoving supplies around the various war fronts in Asia and Europe, Goldwater would come to develop a great loathing of both his fascist enemies and what he viewed as the failures of the Kennedy administration's peace policies. Following the defeat, Goldwater's aggressive rhetoric and unabashed social conservatism propelled him to the Senator's seat for Arizona in 1953, replacing the retiring Democrat MacFarland.\n\nGoldwater rose to become one of the leaders of the Democratic faction in the R-D's, resisting recruitment attempts by both the Republicans, due to his personal animosity with Eisenhower, and the NPP, which he views as too fixated on Japan alone and dominated by socialist radicals. His charisma and fiery presence soon set him on a path to the White House.\n\nNow, with Goldwater swept into power by a wave of popular support, the world looks across the seas in hope or worry, as the USA takes another step towards full military mobilization against its fascist enemies around the world."

 USA_gld_68_goldwater_presidency:0 "The Goldwater Presidency"
 USA_gld_68_goldwater_presidency_desc:0 "Barry Goldwater is now in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Senator from Arizona has promised a lot during his election, holding on to his arch conservative base in the South, and the libertarians of the West, while also appealing to the moderates of the Northeast. But his associations with the likes of Donald Regan and his "voodoo economics," and his incendiary anti-fascist views, have made many of those in power uneasy. But it's time to get to work for all of America now. Whether that involves working with those that disagree with him in the party to hammer out compromises, or forging his own path remains to be seen."
 USA_gld_68_sit_with_rockefeller:0 "Sit Down With Rockefeller"
 USA_gld_68_sit_with_rockefeller_desc:0 "Saying that there is tension between President Goldwater and Vice President Nelson Rockefeller would be like saying the sky is blue. While they are both Republican-Democrats, they couldn't be further apart ideologically. Rockefeller was part of the Northeast, liberal, progressive wing of the party that supported Civil Rights and government intervention, while Goldwater was the conservative standard bearer, who rails against such "elitist" sentiments as much as he does against the NPP. But that was before, and this is now, when the R-Ds need to present a united front. While just a formality, meeting with Rockefeller in the Oval Office with some cameras around can show that the two wings of the party can work together for a better America."

In this tradition of unifying the party to face tough challenges, Goldwater has decided to do the same. Liberal and conservative; progressive and libertarian; all will have a seat at the table, and all will have their chance to propose solutions. Let the best ideas win!"
 USA_gld_68_conservative_cabinet:0 "A Conservative Cabinet"
 USA_gld_68_conservative_cabinet_desc:0 "The election proved that America was ready to change course from the muddled liberalism of the past twenty years. Instead of pandering to all factions of the R-D, and risking confusion and delay when decisions need to be made, a staunchly conservative cabinet will be named to ensure that Goldwater's policies will get put in place. We will not be held back by those that want to talk, debate and compromise!"

Eh, that doesn't have the right ring to it. "America is a Broken Nation, and today we begin repairing it." That's it! Let's go with that.\n\nThe President has already asked the major television networks for air time tomorrow evening to give a speech to lay out Goldwater's policies and goals. This speech will also be the perfect opportunity to rally the Republican-Democratic party, the independents that cast their ballot for him, and maybe even strip away some of the R-NPP's support. After all, what better way to get America's attention than through an Oval Office address?"

 USA_gld_68_a_proper_union_desc:0 ""Thank you, and God Bless America."\n\nThe TV cameras shut off, and President Goldwater shuffles the speech he just read on his desk. Staffers and cabinet members in the back of the Oval Office were already cheering and applauding, and the Chief of Staff came up to the Resolute desk, a grin on his face. The speech went off without a hitch. Tomorrow the newspapers will talk about it, and the opinion polls in a couple of weeks will show if it actually did resonate with the American people as well as expected. But the time for talking is done. It's time to roll up the sleeves and get to work. We got a union to save."

 USA_gld_68_revitalize_the_economy_desc:0 "The economy has been languishing under the worst kinds of abuse for years. With the Oval Office now occupied by a fiscal conservative, things are going to get tighter, perhaps for better, perhaps worse; tight budgeting, tight social programs, tight oversights on federal spending, the full oeuvre of constrained government finance. Taxes will be flattened, as will monopolies from unions to corporations to the Federal government itself. The free market with proper nurturing can finely adjudicate many problems on its own and, as ever, the people most directly concerned are financially capable without Federal interference. And if not, it could be that the government has enculturated them to be slavish and dependent, and deteriorated their self-efficiency. The government has over-sought and overwrought its welcome in the affairs of finance that it is at best ill-equipped to manage without trampling the economic rights of American workers and businessmen."
 USA_gld_68_financial_reform:0 "Financial Reform"
 USA_gld_68_financial_reform_desc:0 "Arguably one of the most fervid conservatives in the sitting American government, Goldwater has a tendency to be rather brusque and unflinching in advocating his convictions. As such he will tend to push his party aside if it means they will compromise his aims to back small government conservatism. With this in mind he will meet significant conflict from the liberal wings of his own party (i.e. Nelson Rockefeller) in pushing his ideal of a flattened tax rate, the systematic nullification of LBJ-esque subsidies (agriculture being particularly crucial), defanging overly demanding unions (reexamining the Wagner Act and the like for starters), reinstating voluntarism in union membership, re-delegating the duties of commerce and trade as is fit back to the states, and rifling through all the other laws of finance Congress has made without mind to the 10th amendment's prohibitions on their doing so."
 USA_gld_68_reganomics:0 "Reganomics"
 USA_gld_68_reganomics_desc:0 "A man with a liberalized free market ethos, Don Regan believes heavily in top-down, minimal government (though willing to bend it broader in superficially justifiable cases), supply-side economics with a vocal distaste for the preachments of Keynes and Marx. This entails deregulating boxed in corporations, cutting Federal social spending and other endeavors deemed fruitless or the obligation of states rather than the Washington leviathan, and being so fiscally regimented that it becomes patently difficult to accrue debt in the first place. Though this does not mean Regan is at all averse to padding the budget out ever so slightly in favor of those good ole job creators and our men of arms."
 USA_gld_68_go_with_regan:0 "Go With Regan"
 USA_gld_68_go_with_regan_desc:0 "Rebuking the moderates thins the line between Goldwaterian economics and a better cohered market for America. However, with Don Regan at the reigns of the treasury, it's now imperative to remain on the same page with him and tug him along in the right direction. He has a tendency to romanticize supply side policy without clearly following its actual stated objectives if political expediency presents itself more attractively. Optimistically, referring him back to his boss' unwavering, literalist fealty for the Constitution will make him think twice if needed. It will all be easy enough if you can follow the 10th amendment, kill monopolies, cut government, and emancipate the American economy from the welfare state. Keep the market free, and keep it healthy."
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down:0 "Tone it Down"
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down_desc:0 "Statism cannot be cut down in a day, and the Republicans are not all bad; the balance between left and right is what keeps the country afloat and Goldwater knows it. This, of course, means setting Don Regan aside and keeping the incumbent Treasury Secretary in his appointed position. As his dear friend Buckley might advise, if they can simply be persuaded to explore the options with a Goldwater presidency and market, it will be easier to extricate them from thinking government is the soothing balm for all social wounds. Goldwater will make his cuts into welfareism and state apparatuses more gradual in exchange for an easier time pushing his objectives through an already divided Congress. In due time, the reigns will be secure, and America set right."
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression:0 "Out of Depression"
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression_desc:0 "Our economy cannot and will not recuperate from the Depression without letting it sort itself into order before applying any government bandaids. To Goldwater, a significant reason for perdurable American economic success in the 19th century was the wisdom against adversely impacting the market with artificial government competition; deviating from which is certainly what wrought the cancer that is corporate monopoly upon the world, and shifty union men along with it. Open competition, free trade, and resisting the urge to make the government's teat a congregation of suckling infants who'll take generations to recover their prosperity, even more so their independency thereby will bear their laborious fruits in due time. The object is a process which respects the rule of law, for which Goldwater has all the patience in this world."
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy:0 "A Sound, Fiscal Economy"
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy_desc:0 "Sound and fiscal means, quite frankly no more promiscuous dalliances with experimental social aid, not a bit more of the old, fruitless rigmarole of pumping money into the states until they comply with Federal standards, and not a whisper of mention for subsidizing failure with people's hard earned tax dollars. Industry will be stimulated by more unrestrained trade with America's remaining allies with emphasis placed on hard cash getters like American coal and plant grains for exports, and European luxury goods (in limited quantities), minerals, oil, and dispensable commodities for imports. Broad markets and narrow Federal waste will lead the American economy to stable triumph."
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation:0 "Program Evaluation"
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation_desc:0 "The more useless programs, the more the government spends on gratuitous, self-expanding ventures that harm and hamper more than they help. The market becomes plainly impotent when the government subsidizes failure or bails out economic decrepitude, anchoring it to the measly pittances the Federal bodies are actually capable of throwing at the problem. More programs mean more tax money thrown in directions that people could have used to make it out better on their own and of course ever higher taxes to exact the funds needed to support such a bloated apparatus. As such, it's time to cleave welfare and benefits of the like that are better provided by the people most directly involved. From corporate headquarters to country farms, it's high time to bean crippling dependency on government money in the head."
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies:0 "Reduce Agricultural Subsidies"
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies_desc:0 "Farms are an irreplaceable component of American infrastructure, but what good are they if they are forced to wastefully produce more than they can realistically distribute? Goldwater submits the only thing worse than the explicit endorsement of perishable excesses, is the implicit funding of non-production to maintain an imaginary placeholder. And since when did the 10th amendment sanction this sort of foolish meddling in agriculture to begin with? Let the chips fall where they may, let farms and farmers live up to their proper potentials, and good riddance to these cumbersome subsidies, suffocating price supports, and counterintuitive production controls. If farmers cannot cultivate our land without the Federal government mucking up the works, the country will never get around to making a living off of it."
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare:0 "Cut Wasteful Welfare"
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare_desc:0 "Within the Goldwater approach, what he and other fiscal rightists call "welfareism" is the scourge of a healthy state, market, and nation. If it suspends the 10th amendment for any excuse whatsoever in order to permit a government imposition on the country's economy, it is an inherent outgrowth of this affliction. The larger body of Federal aid, social programs, and stimulus pick-me-ups comprise the spiteful organism that primarily embodies said "welfareism". It stunts the people and businesses by making the government a strident economic competitor in the market which drives competition off the rails rather than the government searching for non-competitive foul play as like its delegated responsibilities from the trustbusting 1910's. It worsens the government by giving it a part it does not know how to play with the competency instilled from the consequences of being a private body who must suffer the results it reaps from both successful and failed operations. It becomes the proverbial bull in the China shop, while somehow acquiring proprietary rights to the entire China shop. Anti-welfare propositions intend to consign that chaos to yesterday."
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget:0 "Balanced Budget"
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget_desc:0 "With Congressional spending on the path to an equilibrium status, that equilibrium itself will need to be secured. The measures needed to accomplish that lie in pruning yet more spending outgrowths, redundant government offices, even whole departments that are, in accordance with the 10th amendment as well as a groaning Federal pocketbook, foundationally gratuitous. No more will the Keynesian doctrine of self-debt be permitted to crawl along the floorboards of the Capitol and White House, debts will be addressed by unfailingly consistent payment plans where possible or go un-incurred in the first place. If the government can't pay it, loans should become a last resort rather than a convenient stepping stone to gratifying the social magicianship of big-headed policy men. If it involves profligately overarching regulation, it should be examined to see how it can be cut down rather than gymnastically complicated into being "workable". The budget should not be a wishlist for fanciful politicians, but rather a well-oiled machine to keep the country running, and that requires a compact unit that meets bare civic necessities instead of drooling over wasteful stimulus packages."
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling:0 "Cap the Debt Ceiling"
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling_desc:0 "Inordinate, reckless expenditure has become Congress' default resolution for various national crises. The administration's fiscal conservatism demands this halts immediately so the government can apportion tax dollars more judiciously; as well as explore other solutions to social and infrastructural maladies than vomiting Federal coffers dry into them. To prevent extremity from outdoing itself, Goldwater and company are pushing a cap to the debt ceiling. However, Goldwater knows from his Senate days that this manner of push may be fatally tainted from its outset. Knowing this, his cabinet is hiding a card deck of various spending stopgaps off the table to enter play in the event that the debt ceiling is allowed to fizz out of the bottle. The extraneous buck stops here."

 USA_gld_68_the_working_men_should_work_desc:0 "Next year's budget proposals have caused an uproar, as spending on welfare programs like employment insurance and Social Security have been massively cut back, along with a whole series of other programs that conservatives have long claimed only incentivises laziness and freeloading off the government. In a White House Press Conference, President Goldwater himself has stood up for his proposals, saying that these programs have been given too freely in the past to "... those that can, and should be working, but choose not to because they think the government can provide for them." But it's the last line that dominates headlines: "Working men should work!""
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs:0 "Kill the Tariffs"
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs_desc:0 "Goldwater has always been a believer that America can, and always will, build anything better than anyone else. However, that can lead to situations where American made products are expensive and out of reach of millions of poorer Americans. Regan has proposed that maybe tariffs should be cut on imported goods from other countries, to allow cheaper products from overseas to provide for these markets that American companies aren't providing for. Plus, since the US isn't spending as much money on welfare anymore, we don't need to collect as much money as before. So why not make the accountants jobs at the Treasury Department a little bit easier?"

 USA_gld_68_skin_the_budget_desc:0 "The budget is still hinderingly bloated, and Goldwater figures it is high time to simply skin its blubbery carcass alive. Patience with its engorged stature has only led to failure in the limited four year stints of other chief executives, and Goldwater refuses to be another complacent zookeeper that feeds into its bulk. The administration will begin an effective immediate lobby push for reduced social programs, moderate prohibitions on Federal loan taking, slashing a chunk from commerce regulations, particularly as levied at farmers, small businesses, and interstate merchants. Special, pricey, and cronyist protections for unions and massive companies: out. More money for defense, civil services, and necessary infrastructure: in. Cut the fat and produce a smaller budget in proportion to the realistically smaller legitimate duties of the Federal government."

With the lazy bums forced to find jobs since their monthly free money has vanished, there are now millions more people looking for work. So what if the bleeding heart liberals are crying at us for pushing poverty levels up? It's only because they aren't working hard enough. With an expanded workforce crying for jobs, we can now encourage companies to invest and build in America, making all the stuff our nation will ever need. They don't need to build their branch plants or invest overseas. We already have the largest single market in the world. America First!"

The American war machine hasn't thoroughly greased its joints in what seems like ages, and little eases friction in them quite like money for war machines and a place to send them. Needless to say, this entails a comprehensive austerity to reserve the funds for purchasing equipment, arms, and such; not to mention the scrap materials to manufacture them. Public allotments for social programs, subsidies, and commerce enforcements evaporate from their original applications and resurface back in the Defense Department's coffers via executive order and urgently phrased, persuasive communiques to Congress. The skin is pulled tight to Uncle Sam's face and he's letting the excess come out in munitions and engines to drive them to their scheduled destination."

 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan_desc:0 "A vaguely technocratic ideal of the military, Donald Rumsfeld's program is one for endorsing hardware over manpower, while paring down, refining, and reapplying the select droves of men we already have enlisted (usually in more sparing placements and field assaults, but on what are deemed to be more strategic contact points). Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age. Goldwater in his air force background finds this appealing if a tad wishy-washy in its forcefulness. Nonetheless, it would prove an immense shift in American war doctrine, and, if the war is lost, we'll lose more money than men."

 USA_gld_68_mcnamara's_vision_desc:0 "In Washington quite a few of the big wigs in Goldwater's military cabinet, chiefly Robert McNamara, have had a mana from heaven realization; more troops mean we can simply swarm the RK forces with raw numbers. The Nazis are already reliant on strained slave labor conditions for their resources, even a good portion of their conscripts. If they can be exhausted thoroughly via good ole fashioned G.I. mass deployments and mass encirclements, they can be driven back, their resolve as well as their personnel depleted and broken. No nation on Earth save Japan could withstand the full blooming mobilization of America's young men against it all at once. Those paltry few that could would usually need weapons of mass destruction to definitively repel the pressurized application of so many well-coordinated invaders. Enough men will send the Reich packing, of this McNamara is positive."

In tandem with the adverse, novel climate in which the war is fought, such lack of veteran specialty in jungle combat is becoming disastrous for American forces. As such, the request has been made and granted for trained special forces units for whom underhanded, unorthodox warfare tailored to the difficult African climate is an object rather than an inconvenient resort. In lieu of overwhelming the Germans with old fashioned G.I.'s en masse, a more scalpel-esque approach will be adopted. Saliently, these divisions will engage the enemy in booby trapping, sabotage, guerrilla tactics, deep reconnaissance measures, skirmish and ambush oriented firefights; the genuine article of commando-focal warfare. If all goes swimmingly, the Nazis won't be able to out-adapt this rigorously versatile approach before it is far too late."

This means introducing, manufacturing, and developing superior trucks, half-tracks, tank destroyers, and of course, tanks. With a fresh steel bulwark driving at their weary heels, the Krauts scarcely stand a chance. An increase in armored vehicles, particularly tanks will provide a boon, both literal and figurative to the average G.I. who will be able to call a much harder hammer down on skirmish prone swathes of RK-held territory. To boot, modern tanks can aid in the eventual push back to conventional war doctrine as the Germans are compelled to do battle in the open air as well as African villages."

As a matter of national livelihood it should take a role on the center stage of government spending and prioritization. Greater portions of collected taxes will be delegated to the defense budget, and the budget itself will be marginally enlarged. Public support of the armed services will be encouraged, war austerity policies fostered, factory jobs lauded, and domestic morale safeguarded.

That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile. An encroachingly irreplaceable element for American G.I.'s as it ferries them with facility, speed, and force to each front as battles ever-changing-ly unfold; providing a formidable hailstorm of leaden cover fire whenever needed. Synthesized with hardened infantry, the helicopter and its tactics are a revolution in American war-making ability."

The gargantuan demand for better guns has transformed into an equally exigent insistence for arms with growingly staggering caliber and destructive capacities. Larger artillery pieces, more efficient mortars, and bombs that can level the fortified installations which dapple the enemy's lines; anything with a bang big enough to ensure they think twice about advancing or sticking it out.

Great men have to risk their lives for it without fail throughout the annals of history, and that time has come again, both for it and the liberty of our dear friends in Africa. Far from being lethally drastic; minimal conscription measures are what Goldwater has in mind. A selective service and lottery system will be more than apt to bring in the surplus manpower necessary to bow the head of the Reichskommissariats. Every man who gives his life for Africa's liberty will go down as a hero, and those heroes who haven't stepped forward may yet be found."

As our allies they should be more than willing to aid the force superior in strength to them on their side. That might will only supplement their own so much if it is left to languish confused as it is consistently outwitted by a far more locally acclimated enemy. Spotting unique styles of booby trap, learning what to listen for in the underbrush, and understanding ambush positions in the foliage before they can be sprung among other things will all work towards our boys' favor."

Flame-based and explosive projectile weapons capable of being fielded by small companies, platoons, and squads will also enter development and selection to enable their progress through the sweltering verdure populated with Nazis.

War and its fruits are never costless, such is the eternal burden of free, fiercely principled nations who must resort to it against such tyrannies as the Nazis.

Regarding those courageous youth; there simply are not enough of them in the service to deploy against the Reich's tides. Conscription will be accelerated to meet the call of duty against the unrelenting Nazi specter. No man can fight forever, which is why fresh faces with fresh reserves of combat vigor must sally forth to crush the fascists head on.

The prospective boom from cycling against the ravages of war with raw production is tempting to say the least too.

If the Reich cannot be halted in Africa, Lord knows what they may be bold enough to attempt next, anything on the spectrum from strikes using weapons of mass destruction to another global conquest; the likes of which has not been seen for years. Safety can always be bought in more guns and war supplies, so why not secure oneself in the event of Reich getting any more audacious or threatening they already are?

For years the various states have put up barriers to the workings of financial institutions, forcing banks to keep their money in their states and not transfer the money where it needs to go. Some of the smaller states are pleading for more money to invest into their economies, but the larger states jealously guard the money, seeking to keep it where it already is. But with regulations slashed and taxes dropped, soon the local and regional banks that were long complacent will have to compete again, which will only help small businesses and entrepreneurs to get the financing they need to get growing."

While some economists say that both plans could be risky, even dangerous as the economy is growing so much faster without the limits of gold and silver, and cutting all ties to some of the largest, if undemocratic, powers in the world could cause an economic recession, Goldwater is very intrigued with the proposals, and as a break from the past.

No middle ground can be found with men who stubbornly insist on wholesale nationalizations, state-funded bribery, and other such reckless, pie-in-the-sky policies. Nevermind Rockefeller's advice -- America's better off if these men were excluded from its politics altogether!"
 USA_gld_68_infiltrate_the_NPP_leftists_desc:0 "In their reckless push for relevance, the schizophrenic coalition called the NPP has taken to accepting anyone who at the very least harbors a strong antipathy for the Japanese Empire. Its leftist subfaction appends the party's already loose membership criteria with a pathological love for socialism in any of its shades; so long as one loves Marx and hates Japan, in other words, they are free to wear the gold eagle wherever they go.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for the President to exploit: By sending plainclothes to join their ranks, digging for dirt becomes as easy as attending a rally. The information they extract will have much use in his hands, whether as "informed predictions" or... something markedly less pleasant."
 USA_gld_68_an_anti_socialist_education_desc:0 "The biases and beliefs we hold to our graves coalesce in the classrooms of our youth, hardening with age. Because a nation has such a narrow window to enculture its children with a shared identity, school curricula emphasize civic education as early as grade school or their equivalent thereof.\n\nSimilar logic applies to reinforcing their worldview from certain ideologies -- a man taught to steer away from socialism's allure in his childhood is less inclined to join protests and vote for socialist-friendly politicians than one whose tryst with it began in college. Consequently, inoculating the nation's youth from socialism entails enforcing anti-socialist curricula in all levels of education. This is a mission the President is all too happy to undertake."

Additionally, the blazing trail they leave behind is enough to engulf entire worlds with a conflagration that ends only when the last atom of oxygen is fed to the fires.\n\nUp until now, President Goldwater had seen no need to liken himself to a slash-and-burn farmer. But with the overabundance of kudzu threatening to cover all ten million of America's square miles with a thick, suffocating layer of red leaves... well, he imagines Cronkite will spend a whole day thinking of a good lede for some of the scoops Hoover's boys digged up."

Some sympathetic, if unusual, fellows from the opposition congratulated him in private -- apparently "despite [his] traitorous heritage" to quote one of the letters verbatim -- for conclusively dealing with one of their party's unwanted sores.\n\nHe knew better of course. Only fools with the arrogance of Hercules, but with none of his strength, would say that the socialist hydra was slain for good. The President has merely done his part, and all he can do now is hope the American people will maintain vigilance for its impending return."
 USA_gld_68_focus_on_the_yockeys_desc:0 "Socialism may be an old enemy of the American way, but even a conservative can admit that both ideologies agree to some extent on the value of freedom and the rights of man. These similarities make socialism familiar -- comforting even -- to many Americans, for all its faults. However they disagree on the means to achieve peace and prosperity for our people, either side's adherents can take comfort in knowing that the other will eventually be swayed to theirs because of the common goal they share.\n\nFascism, on the other hand, deifies unthinking obedience and lionizes the omnipotence of strongmen. Nowhere else can one find an ideology more anathematic to American values than the Reich's slavish adherence to the supremacy of one race over all mankind. To combat this unnatural foe, and their present sympathizers within the United States, President Goldwater was convinced to set aside its century-old blood feud with socialism for the time being."

Despite the hate -- in some cases, because of the hate -- that leaves his mouth as spittle, he has garnered himself a steadily-growing base of disaffected Americans from all walks of life, all willing to hear his proffered solutions to their many problems. Often these solutions involved the brutal acts his Nazi inspirations conduct, chief among them wanton violence and the persecution of America's sheltered oppressed.\n\nJust as mildly put is President Goldwater's antipathy for a man who would shoot him out of a principled hatred for his father's ancestry. An intern questioned if his personal spite for the beloved fascist had driven the order to ruin him with blackmail from CIA infiltrators; to that, the Arizonan simply answered with a knowing smile and a pithy about cutting a snake's head off before it can slither away."

The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep.

So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance. No friend to the Reich's poisoned honey indeed."

Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice.

America's faith in its noble ideals, forever tarnished by the scandals many had thought are beneath the hallowed office of presidency.\n\n[USA.GetLeader] now takes his place, immediately burdened with the ashes Wallace had left behind in his dogged quest to burn America down.

Such behavior will eat away at the slivers of unity the government has left; yet if they break away, then the hope of a functioning Congress will soon follow. For the time being, the President will reproach the progressives and their allies in private, and ask them to desist until we get things in better order."

Just as much effort was spent on predicting the fallout of such a move in America's conservative half. Needless to say, its displeasure -- though weakened by Wallace's self-induced damage -- will bellow loudly from atop chimneys, church steeples, and Capitol Hill's marble dome itself.

He sought to advance the rights of states, but in doing so had compelled the federal government to commit many egregious violations against them. His hatred for the Black had instead become the Blacks' greatest asset. By the time his face kissed the White House's lawn, support for civil rights had reached highs unprecedented -- and he has only himself to blame.\n\nNow it is up to the new President to address the reintensified debate over civil rights.

In a few years' time, Wallace had single handedly impeded America's economy from improving for years yet.\n\nThis mistake must be rectified not only for the good of the nation, but also for the good of its citizenry.

Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting.

Streams of money, once dried but now restored, have slaked the thirst of schools longing for new textbooks and classrooms. Teachers and students return to their desks in droves.

This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to "improve" states' rights. Put short, a man who wields the federal government like a mallet to force laws into Congress only has states rights as a tangential goal at best.

Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America. It will take time to untangle the mess he had left behind to local laws, but restoring faith in an integral aspect of America's political system is worth any effort."

With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again.

#GOLDWATER'S BILL LOC




 bill_30_passed:0 "In what is sure to be a landmark moment for President Goldwater's administration, the proposed budget has been accepted by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Initially highly unpopular and still polarising even now, extensive lobbying has managed to secure the support necessary for the bill being passed.\n\nThe bill, which includes the slashing of welfare and social security budgets, has paved the way for the president's broader economic and fiscal agenda. While it is uncertain how this budgetary reorientation is going to impact the American economy in the long run, analysts have been cautiously optimistic. The Goldwater administration meanwhile, is overjoyed at this major political victory. It is likely the administration will want to capitalise on the momentum the passing of the budget has generated, and more proposals are expected to follow.\n\nAs could have been expected however, the adoption of the budget has unfortunately widened the divisions within the Republicans-Democrats. Many Republicans have expressed their deep opposition to the president's fiscal agenda. Consequently, many of them now feel tempted to flock into the welcoming and eager arms of the Center-NPP. How this will affect the stability of the coalition will remain to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, it is a major victory for the White House and Secretary Don Regan in particular, whose fiscal philosophy, dubbed "Reganomics", has been the cornerstone of the bill. This victory is a momentous occasion which is undoubtedly to lead to the popping of champagne bottles in the oval office. Certainly, the president can sleep a little easier knowing this battle has been won."

It now seems however, that these efforts were to no avail, as the bill lies dead on the floor of congress.\n\nWith the rejection of the president's budget, the flagship of the White House's economic and fiscal agenda has been sunk. Weeks of hard work have been undone in a single stroke and it seems ever more uncertain if President Goldwater will be able to push the other elements of his fiscal and economic agenda through congress. For now, the new administration's efforts have been stopped dead in their tracks. Reportedly the cabinet is currently convening in a room in the West Wing on how to proceed from here on out. Secretary Don Regan, whose fiscal philosophy has been a central component of the bill, seems particularly infuriated at the news of the bill's defeat.\n\nOpponents of the bill have been overjoyed however, with the Republican half of the Republicans-Democrats having found cause to celebrate. How this will affect the Democrats' position is uncertain, although this legislative defeat has certainly shown their weakness. In any case, it is a serious blow to the president's agenda. The White House will have to find a way to regain the initiative."

Opposite of him, Senator Richard Russel Jr, representing his faction of the NPP.\n\n"Mister President-" Russel began. "-I've looked at your bill in detail, and I am convinced it can be salvaged." Goldwater knew exactly what "salvaged" meant here. He had no illusions who he was dealing with, and what sort of price Russel would ask in exchange for cooperation. It was why the president had invited him here today, hoping that Russel's demands wouldn't be too outrageous. On the other side of the table Senator Russel looked at him with appraising eyes. The Georgian senator too, knew perfectly well who he was dealing with. Goldwater was many things, but committed on the issue of civil rights he was not. Russel was well aware of the president's ambivalence on the matter. Such ambivalence might be an opening for Russel's own political agenda, so he thought to himself. If the president was willing to budge here, Russel would be able to budge on the topic of finance.\n\n"It seems to us that your budget proposal entails a significant reduction in spending, freeing up a significant amount of federal funds." the president could already guess where Russel was going with this. "Perhaps it is time some of these funds made their way back to the south.'" Russel leaned forward on the table, closing the physical distance between him and the president. "We'd be willing to lend you the votes you need, Mr. President." "If room can be made in the bill to send some of the available funds to Southern schools."\n\nRussel paused briefly.\n\n"White schools, naturally.""

Indeed, many times Rockefeller had been a vocal critic of the president's proposed course.\n\nOn the coffee table before them laid an assortment of papers. They were parts of the proposed budget bill, with certain clauses underlined or stricken with a pen: the result of three hours of back-and-forth between the two men.\n\n"I'm asking you to put the party first, Barry." it was the first time Rockefeller had addressed the president by his first name. It took Goldwater by surprise, but there was no hint of disrespect in Rockefeller's voice. "If we agree on this, you'll get your budget, and we'll keep the party intact."\n\nGoldwater leaned back on his couch, thinking to himself. In the back of his head he still heard the ringing of secretary Regan's urgings not to compromise. Yet the deal Rockefeller offered was a tempting bargain.

As a result, the United States of America has taken the first steps towards eliminating its national debt and ending the long-standing self-destructive policy of deficit spending.\n\nThis cap marks a minor milestone in the series of fiscal measures proposed by President Goldwater. While the bill is but a sideshow to the greater ambitions of the president, any victory in the American political colosseum is to be welcomed. Morale has surged amongst the president's supporters, and the Democratic wing of the Republicans-Democrats feels particularly empowered. It looks good for the president and his administration as now they have shown they can deliver on their promises and that they can cash the checks they write. This victory is bound to play particularly well in the South.

It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Rockefeller to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Rockefeller, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nOf course, Goldwater would never come out to say such a thing publically, even if it was true.\n\n"I'm currently assembling my cabinet.

"Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure. And hire writers, musicians and painters to create art?" He tore that page out with a particular vengeance. "The last thing the government should be doing is paying anyone to splatter paint on a canvas. If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold."\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. "Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War," Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. "Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month.""I agree, Mr. President," Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. "I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss. Most of the rest can be amalgamated, and then have their combined budgets reduced to an appropriate level."\n\n"I want this binder to be less than half the size," Goldwater said, slamming the binder shut.

Why would anyone be willing to pay farmers to lose money? If they can't cut it, then they should sell their land to more successful farmers and get out!\n\nAlready there are protests by farmers throughout the South at state capitol buildings and federal courthouses, angry at how the government has been treating them over the past decade.\n\n"First all the Civil Rights nonsense, talking about making the blacks our equals. And now they want to destroy our livelihoods? There won't be a single free farmer left in Dixie by the end of the year if this happens. Everyone will be broke, or no better than a slave!"\n\nAlready activists have been going to small towns throughout Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi, telling the farmers about what their Democrat President is trying to do, and how they can fight back by supporting the National Progressive Party, especially the Far Right faction of the NPP.

 GLD.7.desc:0 "Various Presidents and administrations over the years have sought to leave their legacy on the nation, usually with bold programs to make the life of Americans better, easier, more productive and more. So catchy names and programs with a word-scramble of acronyms were created. The SSA, the WPA, the AAA, the FRA, NIRA and several dozen more. Slogans like "The New Deal," "the Fair Deal," and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Republicans or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

But the President is also keenly aware that he will need help from the more liberal Republicans within the party in order to pass such a budget, and compromises will have to be reached. In fact, the proposed cuts that are coming out now seem to actually be rather moderate, and more technical than anything. Few programs are being shut down, while others will be merged to realize efficiencies in administration and the bureaucracy, which usually is the largest expense anyway in these kinds of assistance programs. Some funding for grants to states on health, education, food and shelter assistance and more is also being reduced, and more requirements are being put in place to ensure that only those that actually need it are receiving the funds.\n\nIn general, no one is happy with the budget, but few are really angry over it either: Democrats are displeased that the spending isn't even more drastic, while Republicans are disappointed that funding for some benefits that they consider worthwhile and important has been reduced. The NPP is on both extremes: demanding more social spending, or demanding the whole system of Social Security and Medicare and more be totally demolished. So Goldwater can rest easy in that, with everyone not getting what they want, but not totally losing everything either, that must mean he made a compromise that will pass Congress."

While he didn't get the chance in 1964 to put his plan into motion, now he might get the chance with a conservative like Goldwater in the White House. They had both worked together in the Senate for several years before hand, and Goldwater liked what he heard from Bennett's speeches and proposals for more international trade and re-establishing the Gold Standard. However, Goldwater decided against bringing Bennett onto his cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, instead going for the hardline conservative-libertarian Donald Regan, as he wanted someone he could trust in the Senate to help get his proposals through. Since most of it was Bennett's brainchild, so much the better.\n\nBy pursuing the twin goals of Free Trade and the Gold Standard, Goldwater and Bennett have what they perceive to be a winning strategy: increased prosperity, an end to the economic stagnation of the previous generation, and giving the American people hope for the future. Now, what shape Free Trade would take is still a matter of debate in the halls of power, as Goldwater's anti-fascist views means that increased trade with Germany and Japan would be abhorant to him, while concern over the size, wealth and even political will of the OFN members mean they aren't as great as markets as business leaders would like. And restoring a true gold standard can mean either great things if done right, or a huge economic crash if they fail. It will be a tightrope to walk, but Goldwater and Bennett are sure it can be done."

 GLD.21.desc:0 "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\n"But tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\n"We are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions. Now is the time for America to embrace free trade."

Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear."\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargos with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republican-Democrats, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, "Free Trade" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Democrats, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this "Goldwater Way." Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of "Free Trade." It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Democrat, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

After all, nations like Australia and South Africa, with smaller economies and businesses, would have to face off American behemoths like Ford, Standard Oil and Boeing. With vast resources, skills and labour, the US conglomerates could quickly monopolize these new markets, undercutting their competition and driving the smaller, local companies out of business altogether. But at the same time, the thought of Australian Holden cars or Canadian Avro planes being sold into one of the largest markets in the world with little in the way of tariffs is also deeply appealing.\n\nBut once we are all together, with the diplomatic niceties of being greeted by an honor guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a delicious dinner of wild-caught salmon in their bellies, the real work of international affairs can begin.

There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external Fascist threat from Europe, Asia and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n"I've gathered you here today to discuss...""

In order to achieve this, and to strengthen the OFN, streamlining of equipment such as rifles and ammo, as well as standardizing training, communications and more.\n\n"The war against freedom is a war against America and the OFN," President Goldwater stated in his speech. "America should not flag nor fail to protect not just our friends and allies, but anyone who seeks to free themselves from the Nazi yoke, or the Imperial chains."\n\nPublic response has been mixed so far. In some countries, the thought of sending their young men to poke at the fascist bear by aiding resistance groups has caused anti-OFN protests, while supporters of liberty and freedom have marched in support. Some countries also have anonymously expressed concern that America will have way too much power, being the largest military in the OFN, and could be using the smaller nations as cannon fodder for their own goals, or worse, stripping away historical traditions in the military in favour of American ones. But closer ties within the alliance, and strengthening everyone's economies in turn, may in turn make the whole stronger.

Despite a last ditch attempt at a Filibuster from an NPP Senator that stretched late into the night, calling the bill a "...disaster in the making for the hardworking American..." Yockey's supporters denounced it as a return to the failed interventionist politics of the past. However, the bill passed with the majority support from the R-Ds and the more moderate members of the NPP, as it was fairly non-controversial in the halls of power. Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports. This will be a victory for everyone: the price of raw materials, oil, consumer goods and more from nations like Canada, Australia and South Africa will be cheaper for US companies and consumers, while giving an economic boost to America's friends and allies."

The unilateral effort to remove trade barriers was supposed to make trade between America and her allies cheaper and more expedient, which would have benefited all sides, or so Goldwater and the RDs have claimed.\n\nThe L-NPP was opposed from the get go, as they claimed the bill would pulverize the American economy, and more importantly, the American worker. By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their "America First" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck president.

However, concerns regarding the removal of tariffs, the dismantling of import quotas, the harmonization of regulations and the extension of copyright protections need to be addressed in the NATC negotiations.

And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade. Mexican's especially believe that the NATC is just a way to get their nation to join the American lead Organization of Free Nations alliance, which would end their decades of neutrality.\n\nAll these problems, and many more, will have to be overcome if the NATC is to be put in place.

Some call it Libertarian, some call it Fiscal Conservatism. Barry Goldwater calls it Common Sense.\n\nEver since the Great Depression, Washington has steadily gained more and more power.

Then with the war and the mobilization for it, came inspectors, support for unions, restrictions, rationing of resources, all called temporary, all to win the war.\n\nBut even the war ended in humiliation and defeat, the technocratic, heavy handed bureaucrats and their stalwart allies in Congress doubled down, clinging to their offices and positions, throwing more and more money at every problem. But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt.

Unions too, for what are they but bloated bureaucracies that only survive to steal money from hard working Americans?

Yellowstone's quiet beauty brought him back to the simpler, happier days of his boyhood, running across Arizona's scorching scrublands with his brother and his sisters. Every American deserved to grow up like that, raised in nature's loving embrace.\n\nThe director let the President know they were ready.

Taking a deep breath to steady his thoughts, he began.\n\n"My fellow Americans. Today I speak to you from Yellowstone National Park, greatest among America's natural monuments.

The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill.

He'd spoken to his advisors the previous day: Rockefeller strongly supported it, Regan disapproved, insisting it would be a waste of government funds, and McNamara and Curtis were relatively blase and disinterested. Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday! Through exhausted eyes, Goldwater once again looked over his work so far, trying to make it all come together in his mind. The EPA couldn't be too radical, but it couldn't be limp-wristed either or he might as well just not create it. It needed teeth, but it shouldn't be so powerful as to completely alienate the world of business and their 'friends' in Congress. And, of course, there was the small matter of how exactly the EPA would be funded, meaning which program would have its budget drained to bankroll it.\n\nThe President rested his chin on his hand. So many problems, all requiring decisions. He couldn't let himself forget that what he was doing here was important, that it would change the lives of Americans for decades to come. Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later.

Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line.

When he touched the pen to paper, he felt the familiar fiery indignation building in his chest. Would Michelangelo have knocked off David's head just to satisfy his critics?\n\nThe President faltered, torn. It'd be easy to sign and endorse McNamara's proposal, just a few strokes of the pen and he'd be able to avoid the anger of his voter base, and the party conservatives, and the business community.

He hoped the one with the blonde beehive hairdo would be there today. She knew just how he liked it.\n\nAlready the President was pondering what the public would make of his new bundle of policies aimed at increasing the prosperity of the National Parks program by expanding the size of many parks and drastically increasing their federal funding. He knew plenty of the Republicans and the progressives in the NPP would rail against what they saw as him taking money out of the hands of the poor and giving it to a gang of tree-huggers and mountain-climbers, but he knew, with just the slightest smile, that it wasn't too likely they'd be able to sway the public to their side.\n\nThe fact was that most Americans would be glad or at the very least ambivalent towards the good news that the National Parks would continue to be a major pillar in the preservation of America's environment. Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

President Goldwater steepled his fingers as he looked down blearily at what he'd been working on for the past six hours, trying to devise an ideal blueprint for his Environmental Protection Agency. He'd spoken to his advisors the previous day: Rockefeller strongly supported it, Regan disapproved, insisting it would be a waste of government funds, and McNamara and Curtis were relatively blase and disinterested. Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday! Through exhausted eyes, Goldwater once again looked over his work so far, trying to make it all come together in his mind. The EPA couldn't be too radical, but it couldn't be limp-wristed either or he might as well just not create it. It needed teeth, but it shouldn't be so powerful as to completely alienate the world of business and their 'friends' in Congress. And, of course, there was the small matter of how exactly the EPA would be funded, meaning which program would have its budget drained to bankroll it.\n\nThe President rested his chin on his hand. So many problems, all requiring decisions. He couldn't let himself forget that what he was doing here was important, that it would change the lives of Americans for decades to come. Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later. He was, after all, the President."

Goldwater saw his Vice-President subconsciously draw back as he flicked his incandescently icy gaze on him. The air seemed to have been sucked from the room, the weight of what Goldwater had just read settling on him like an avalanche. Finally, bringing himself under control even as he felt that inflamed, boiling little ball in his stomach growing by the second, the President broke the tension.\n\n"So this is all of them," said the President. A statement, not a question. Rockefeller deflated with instant relief like a punctured balloon. "Yes, Mr. President. My aides and I have been working on this for some time now. This is every individual, business and governmental organization we have identified as being potential cohorts in a plan to subvert your environmental policies. As you can see, it contains members of Congress, local governments and members of the Fortune 500, including many individuals we have previously tagged as potentially engaging in corrupt activity."\n\nThe President just sat there, saying nothing, staring into the middle distance. Rockefeller gulped and, finding his courage, sallied forth. "Mr. President?"\n\nGoldwater's eyes snapped onto him. "Well Nelson," said the President, "I'd say we've got some work to do.""

Hailed as a major blow against electoral corruption, the FECA was intended to level the playing field and root fraud from the political process.\n\nNevertheless, there will always be people willing to skirt the law if they think it'll get them what they want. Money makes the world go round, after all, and the marble halls of government are packed with those willing to have a few greenbacks stuffed in their back pocket.\n\nPresident Goldwater had been furious to discover businesses were working with politicians to subvert his environmental legislation, but his anger then was a pale comparison to the Hadean rage that burst from him when he was informed that major businesses had made illegal donations to pro-business, anti-environment politicians in exchange for votes. Lobbying is one thing, outright bribery is quite another.\n\nDriven by that ball of cold fury that burned within him, Goldwater decided to push the big red button and call out the corrupters and their lackeys who were so willing to undermine America's democratic traditions to continue unabated their plunder of the environment. And so, ever the believer in The System, he took them to court. Let's see how smug they are when the judge reads out their misdeeds for the whole nation to hear."

"The National Renaissance Party's being run here, right? Out of your apartment? You really should clean up if you're having company over." Another book of esoterica joined the pile, and Richards pushed over the shelf for good measure.\n\nAn hour of searching later, the raiders departed leaving chaos and broken furniture in their wake.

A silhouette slinks inside, closing the door behind him, careful not to make a noise. For a moment all is as it was before the shadowy figure's trespass. Still, silent, dark.\n\nA flashlight disguised as a ballpoint pen strikes, pointing a beam of dim blue light across the shag carpet. The man holding it slips out of his shoes and paces soundlessly across the carpet, anxious to finish his job quickly. He knows the impulse is absurd; the room's tenant being kept busy by a pair of dazzlingly beautiful women downstairs on the casino floor. Why do these fat, balding old men never get suspicious when centerfold girls half their age suddenly find them impossibly alluring?\n\nSupposing he shouldn't complain as it made his job a hell of a lot easier, he got to work. In the space of a few minutes, pen-light held in his mouth, he hid bugs all over the room and its ensuite bathroom, in the light fixtures, vents, closet, telephone.

Like President Goldwater he was Jewish, and felt a certain righteousness in foiling the plans of Yockey's men.

Far too clever for his own good, the pig had finally cornered him and uttered the words that would seal his fate.

His quarry spun around, beady little eyes barely visible through the fog. He began to beg for his life, but he was quickly cut off by a bullet to the brain. His corpulent body slumped to the rainwater-slick pavement, a thin line of blood slowly leaking out onto the concrete.\n\nThe agent spun at the sound of distant tires, startled at the appearance of a pair of headlights approaching out of the fog, staring him down like judging eyes. Shoving the revolver in his coat pocket, he clambered over a chain-link fence and skidded down a muddy slope to the street below, making his escape into a knot of twisting alleys.\n\nThe newspapers would call it a senseless murder, motiveless, no suspect. Used car salesman, father of three, devoted husband and pillar of the community. And, though it was not printed, Klokard of the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.

Around him, three unmarked black cars screamed into the parking lot, disgorging a dozen hard-faced men in black suits. Crandall gave the signal, and they strode towards the hotel.\n\nTheir deep-cover boys in extremist groups had finally uncovered actionable intel on the greatest threat to the United States, the infamous fascist ideologue Francis Parker Yockey. After worming his way into Yockey's circle, an agent had reported to Quantico that Yockey always had with him a suitcase filled with forged passports with false identities; Mexican, Swedish, Australian, no doubt as insurance should he ever be forced to flee the country. Ironically, his attempt to escape the law had attracted them to him like a moth to a light. Before the day ended, Crandall would see the Nazi bastard in cuffs.\n\nCrandall and his boys marched across the Sheraton's opulent lobby, making no effort to wipe their feet. He flashed his badge at an irate desk clerk, and, without breaking his stride, flung open the doors to the convention hall where Yockey and his coterie were supposed to be hosting a fundraising event.\n\nInstantly he felt something was wrong. A hundred faces turned to him, but none of them were Yockey's. Gorge rising, his eyes groped for the sign proclaiming the name of the event: Christian Mothers for Teenage Abstinence. Swinging his gaze back to the conventioneers, he realized with a lurch of the stomach that they were middle-aged ladies one and all. Spluttering apologies, he slammed the doors behind him.\n\nThe bastard had flown the coop!

"I know you are not in favor of regulations and such, but most of them are in place for a reason. We no longer poison people from what they eat, or injure them when they are building skyscrapers."\n\n"Don has shown me a lot of research that shows that if we get slackers off the dole, and let companies actually, you know, make stuff, that the whole economy will prosper," Goldwater replied, trying to keep a calm demeanor.

Several Republican-Democrat Congressmen attending the event were seen voicing approval of the Secretary's long-winded heckling of the "McNamara Plan", ostensibly including inappropriate insinuations of the eponymous man's intellect and moral character.\n\nNeither President Goldwater nor Mr. McNamara have issued statements regarding the incident thus far."

Without once mentioning Goldwater's name, Harrington has picked apart, piece by piece, the whole domestic policy of the President, focusing especially on the budget cuts to welfare programs.\n\nWhile Goldwater has been attacked and criticized by many others for these same plans time and time again, they were barely pinpricks to the President.

"And I will assure them that the proposed budget will still make it possible for those that absolutely need the social safety net will receive it."\n\n"Our biggest focus is trying to ensure that federal finances will be sustainable for the long term. This means that some cuts will have to be made, and revenue increased. Welfare and tax reform will go a long way to solving both issues."\n\nThe President spent over half an hour answering questions that the reporters asked regarding costs, who would still qualify, and how the cuts will be implemented over the next few years. While there are many who are disappointed in the cuts, especially in the Republican faction of the R-Ds and members of C-NPP, early reports from pollsters indicate that many swing voters have been convinced by the President's speech.

I'm Walter Cronkite.\n\nWashington, D.C. is in turmoil and shock today with the presentation of President Goldwater's proposed budget to Congress. In a stunning move, many Senators from the President's own party stood up and left the Senate Chamber soon after the debate began on the budget.\n\nThe Republican faction of the R-Ds has been vocally opposed to the President's language and actions in the past few weeks in attempting to cut spending, especially on welfare programs. However, many senators are saying that it was even worse than they thought once they got the chance to read the budget, which led to the Republican Walkout today.\n\n"It is perfectly clear now who the President is supporting," one senator said to reporters as he left the Capitol Building. "And it isn't the average American, or those in dire need of help and assistance. All Goldwater is helping is his libertarian and arch-conservative allies, who want to run roughshod over the poor and struggling."\n\n"This isn't simply balancing the budget," another Senator remarked. "This is an outright declaration of war on the poor, the colored, and disabled. How can we even consider such a proposal without looking at the blood on our hands?"\n\nDemocrats have long supported cutting such spending, seeing it as wasteful, ineffective, leading to a larger government and reducing the liberty, freedom and work ethics of the American worker.\n\nThis may be a huge blow to President Goldwater. The Republican-Democrats, working together since the end of the World War, now seem to be on the verge of collapse, with the right-wing faction of the party gaining ascendance. But it remains to be seen if the budget that the President proposed will actually pass Congress."

However, many Americans are not going to immediately exchange their bills for gold coins, but there is a confidence amongst everyone that if they want to, they can.\n\nWith the confidence of gold backing up the US dollars, and the measures we put in place to keep prices stable and reasonable, we should soon be seeing inflation level off and businesses profits increase. While it may be too early yet to determine the full effects, I'm confident that this accomplishment will bring new prosperity and growth to the United States for years to come."

Those that are not getting the gold or silver are now sure they are being swindled, and banks are on the verge of collapsing. Not only that, but our efforts to set price limits on goods to prevent inflation has also backfired: most of the goods we sought to restrict are now being sold for much more than we decreed, and many stores are being overwhelmed as panicked shoppers try to stock up on everything from canned foods to toilet paper.\n\nNeedless to say, this has been perhaps the worst thing to happen to our economy since the Great Depression. Already many businesses are facing a credit crunch, and layoffs are soon to be widespread. Republican-Democrats in Washington are unable to work together, with liberals blaming conservatives for their misguided actions, and conservatives are accusing liberals of sabotage. The only ones that seem to be enjoying the current situation are the NPP across the aisle. Already, C-NPP leaders and supporters are gloating, saying how they will fix all this.

Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Rockefeller, who represented the "Eastern Establishment" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season.

An FBI negotiator was brought in from Quantico, but the perpetrators refused to respond to any attempts at communication and fired on police when they attempted to recover Officer MacKinnon's body, the dramatic exchange captured on film. On the Governor's order, the FBI was stood down and the perpetrators were engaged by riot police. By 8:45 PM, police had breached the house and killed all four perpetrators, all confirmed to be white males aged 22-38. They also took one unarmed white female into custody. Upon investigation of documents recovered at the scene, the perpetrators have been identified as members of a fringe-right terrorist group comprised of former followers of fascist criminal Francis Yockey. Though it may sound incredible, according to their records, the group, calling themselves Avengers for America, were formulating a plan to assassinate the Hollywood actress and outspoken left-wing activist Jane Fonda for her connection to the Black Panther Party on an upcoming film shoot in Maryland. For now, Mrs. Fonda and the residents of Baltimore can rest easy knowing another threat to their freedom has been defeated.\n\nPresident Goldwater set the newspaper down to look over the photographs.

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer-drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement stand for the NPP's nomination in 1972.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody. Sipping his coffee, the President wondered what to do about the situation. He could put an end to their little commie propaganda campaign, but it might look like a restriction of free speech.

Today's speech consisted of his plan to improve the economy, invest in the defenses of the OFN, and handle America's foreign policy. However, as the former Arizona senator dragged on, his words began to target specific parties in the United States.\n\n"I've encountered plenty of 'bad apples' in the political system of our country, but I have never seen a party more destructive to our way of life than the LNPP. You can't find a good politician in the group, they're all bad! And they want to introduce harsh civil rights policies that would change the country all too quickly! These guys preach the nationalization of every business in America, obviously they want to crack down on individuality! They even want to expand welfare far beyond what we're capable of right now! I don't believe a single 'true' American would support their policies!"\n\nOnce the President finished his speech and began the trip back to Washington, he received a phonie call from his Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. "Barry, did you not hear yourself up there?!" the VP exclaimed, "I hope you remembered that our party is advocating for the same principles you just denounced. Not only are you slinging mud on your own party for no reason, but you were targeting your fellow Americans today. I encourage you to think harder before you make another move against Republicans, whether intentionally or unintentionally.""

The seats are red velvet, the theater covered in gilt and lush artwork, but nobody is here for a philharmonic or touring act. They're here to see their president. Congressman Miller is addressing the rally, enunciating every word to make his speech sound both judicious and vital. The crowd claps gamely, although everyone knows that William E. Miller isn't the star of the show.\n\n"At home, President Goldwater has stood up for the rights and liberties of all Americans."\n\nApplause.\n\n"He has restored prosperity, and built a future that all our children may be proud of."\n\nApplause.\n\n"And through these efforts, he has expanded American prestige abroad, so that we may truly be known as the guardians of the free world!"\n\nStill more applause.\n\n"It is with honor and pleasure, then, that I give you your President of the United States, Barry M. Goldwater!" Everyone leaps up, hooting and hollering as the President steps out onto the stage. It takes the better part of a minute for the ovation to stop. President Goldwater looks out at the thousands of Buffalonians chanting his name. Many of them have left the NPP for good, seeing the Democrats as the right party for the conservatives of the North. Businessmen, housewives, workers, salt-of-the-earth Americans all. This, he thinks, is the party's future. It looks pretty bright."

When he jumped ship to Goldwater's Democrats, he made a lot of friends in Washington. Now, he's standing before ten thousand cheering Mississipians, ready to introduce their president.\n\n"Hasn't President Goldwater stood up for us?"\n\nCheers of acclamation.\n\n"Hasn't he cut taxes, cut spending, and fought for the value of hard work against waste and welfare?"\n\nMore cheers.\n\n"And hasn't he protected our treasured rights, as Mississippians?"\n\nThe cheering turns to roaring.\n\n"Then, Mississippi, let's work to keep President Goldwater in the White House!"\n\nTen thousand Mississipians shout their approval as Goldwater comes up to the podium, shaking Congressman Lott's hand. There's gratitude in that handshake. Men like Lott, and his constituents, may have turned the Northern conservatives against the administration, but down here in Dixie, Barry Goldwater is their man of the year. Among whites, anyhow.

 GLD.union.1.desc:0 "For much of his near-sixty years of life, President Barry Goldwater had maintained one routine without ever skipping a day. At around six in the morning he would wake up, make for the kitchen, and prepare himself a cup of coffee. Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning. He promised every American would have the chance to brew their own coffee. Can't do that without starting the day right, now can he?"

 GLD.union.2.desc:0 "A few days later, The Washington Post issued an article about Congressman so-and-so from the great state of Michigan receiving donation money from the United Automobile Workers last election. It had caused a minor scandal in the leadup, but was soon forgotten after his victory. Barry suspected that these deals had become far too commonplace for the Midwest's politicians to garner their concern. The statesmen of Congress are no less vulnerable to pecuniary concerns than the working man, after all -- what was a little quid-pro-quo with the local union for some pocket change?\n\nNaturally, any man of principle would feel incensed at such blatant corruption. The Arizonan himself was reminded too much of New York and old Tammany Hall -- a well-oiled machine of bribes, favors and ballot boxes -- for comfort.\n\nAnd so it was that he said just as much to Don in a private lunch, to which the Secretary of the Treasury replied shruggingly:"

"Have you other complaints we haven't already heard by now?"\n\n"All I'm saying is an investigation is unwarranted and heavy handed at this point in time. At best it's a questionable, dubious attempt to hold the nation's labor leaders accountable. At worst..."\n\nThe Republican Vice President held a glare at his Democrat colleague. "It's a blatant smear job," he said sotto voce.\n\nRed-faced, Secretary Regan began to burst a reply-\n\n"Gentlemen."\n\n-were it not for President Barry Goldwater's sharp rebuke. The room stilled ramrod stiff as he held up a palm, taking a sip of morning coffee with the other -- they deflated only when he set both down to their proper places on his desk.\n\nThe President steepled his fingers as he fixed both men a stare. He let it linger on his Vice President a fraction of a moment more. "Need I remind you both again to settle your differences like adults, and not like schoolchildren?"\n\nChastised, Regan returned to skimming the portfolio with a grimace. Rockefeller returned the President's stare, before sighing. "Yes, Mister President."\n\nGoldwater nodded. "Director Hoover," he turned towards the table's far end, "you have something to offer?"\n\nAll eyes landed on the FBI's taciturn director. Up until now he said nothing, only scanning the names and details on the briefing like a hawk appraising helpless worms writhing above ground. As soon as his name was called he rose up, tucking the folder to his arms while he made for the door. Before it creaked shut, Director Hoover replied:"

"You've better things to do than listen to an old man drone for another hour, I'm sure."\n\nAs the laughter and camera flashes subsided, a woman wearing an overcoat and no-nonsense demeanor stood up near the front of the gathered press corps. "Helen Thomas, United Press," she introduced. Her pen made scribbles on note-layered paper before Barry could offer a reply.\n\n"Yesterday, the FBI had announced the arrest of several officials from the United Automobile Workers union to, and I quote Director J. Edgar Hoover's following statement verbatim, 'bring these frauds to heel'. Can you elaborate?"\n\nBarry gave himself a thin-lipped moment to ponder an answer. Frauds, eh? Very apt. With a breath he edged closer to the microphone and said, "Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to release the details of an ongoing federal investigation. But know this: Corruption undermines both the integrity of the government's laws and its people's trust therein."\n\nHe soothed his parched throat with a gulp of bottled water. "If these... frauds, as Director Hoover describes them," the President continued, "were proven to have used their subordinates' money to enrich themselves and their political allies, rather than to better their workers' lot, then I will not hesitate to wield all the implements the Constitution has bestowed upon my office to see these men answer to the Blind Lady in court."\n\nA nod from the journalist as she sat down.

 GLD.union.5.desc:0 "Favors, promises and bribes: These three, much more than skill, finesse, or luck, pave the trodden path to success. Companies, friendships, even governments aren't immune to this ugly manifestation of human nature -- Barry needed to glance only once at the muck and grime in Capitol Hill he'd seen since his tenure as Senator to impress that immutable fact into his head.\n\nLabor unions are no different, else why would so many millions flock under their cogs and hammers and sickles? Their playbook is a masterstroke in both its simplicity and its grasp of men's inner machinations: Workers join a union and get all these wonderful benefits, but not before coughing up their cash every now and then and pledging their fealty. Just like that, John Doe gets conned out of both his savings and his free will, tempted by the money to hedge their bets on collective fraud disguised as the highway to a wonderful career. For the rudely awakened... Well, peer pressure and the threat of exile do just fine keeping these comrades in line. Meanwhile, their bosses are free to do whatever they will with countless millions in ill-gotten paychecks. Despicable and abhorrent, but successful all the same.\n\nThis time the roast on Barry's mug was strong and potent, scalding, bitter. It roiled and burbled on his tongue as he read one of several thousand tragedies the White House's mailbox had received since he announced his war on union corruption. After reaching the last dot, he tossed the letter aside and scratched another missive to Director Hoover.\n\nSomething had to be done before these duplicitous "vanguards of workers' rights" swindle another hardworking American. Letting the FBI inspect their sales pitch is as good a first step as any."

If they refuse, a shakedown that escalates in a span of weeks until they acquiesce or leave. So-called "scabs" have no place with the boys, after all; more importantly, bosses love to see their numbers grow.\n\nWhat happened afterwards resembled more of a protection racket than a confraternity of workers. Aforementioned benefits were "delayed" due to supposed problems with their employer, all while payments were leaving their owners for their boss's pockets. The unions stifled all attempts to speak out against such cases of unfair treatment, either with community conformity or with brute thugs masquerading as their "comrades" glowering behind every eye corner.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, these men took the federal government's hand, no matter how questionable its presence, if it meant the chance to sterilize these reservoirs of corruption from top to bottom..."

 GLD.union.7.t:0 "The Union Recruitment Standards Act"
 GLD.union.7.desc:0 "Barry's answer came in the form of one comprehensive bill authored by the Democrats, fast-tracked from one hearing and committee to the next, and finally put out on a vote in both houses of Congress. Its title succinctly summarized its contents: Extensive restrictions on the how's and what's of union recruitment practices. Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Democrats bellowed their assent, Republicans muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their "commitment to beloved principle". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill. The Ayes and Nays have been courted, arms twisted, favors owed and hands shaked. President Goldwater can only shuffle in his seat and see these maneuvers waltz a Congressional ballet on the session floor -- if, of course, they decide to attend at all.."

So did the fountain pen rise and fall in loops to make a capital B, then run another loop crosswise to make a small A, and so on until it stopped as a cursive r's little right notch. With the signature drying up on its front page, the Union Recruitment Standards Act finally became law.\n\nAs soon as the President set his pen to its holder the Oval Office exploded in congratulatory applause and thanks. Shaking hands and hugs wormed their way around the gaps between smartly tailored suits. Cameras snapped a watershed moment for American labor into memory with incandescent flash powder.\n\nSo too did they capture President Goldwater's smiling mien, right before he treated himself with a sip of coffee from a worn-out mug.

Less sympathetic observers would describe the President's response as a diatribe spoken in bad faith.\n\nTwo hundred million Americans react as variedly as one would expect from two hundred million minds. The God-fearing families of the South and Southwest bore the same heavy heart as their President had carried in front of national television. Contrariwise, the working men of Yankeedom and the Pacific Coast paid less heed to the Arizonan's words than the riotous parties they held in celebration of Congress's decision.\n\nAs the minutes wore on and the denouncements petered out, President Goldwater ambled out of the screen after hurling one last snipe at his hated opponents, the trade unionists: "Duplicitous hydras with Medusa's petrifying gaze," he said. Many Americans shared one thought as they watched their commander-in-chief leave the screen with an impatient strut:"

For such a vast, multifaceted campaign with many avenues of failure, diverging opinions on which strategy to undertake was perhaps more of an inevitability than he thought. At least there was consensus on who first to deal with -- that onerous honor belonged to the Senators sympathetic to the trade unionists' cause. Where American compromise stumbled was in these Senators' party affiliations.\n\nIn this issue his allies are split into two roughly even camps. The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Republicans share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence. All wise men know to consider the repercussions of their actions. Whether the Arizonan will exercise his wisdom where it is needed most remains to be seen."

If not America's biggest union, then the bottom feeders nibbling at the scraps it leaves behind.\n\nHoover got a different message shortly after, in yet another of their "personal conversations" behind closed doors."

Sweeter than his standard fare; then again, today was nothing standard either.\n\nGlancing across the table, Barry saw the Director's poison-laced stare bore holes at today's issue of The Washington Times. Its front page had a still of the Supreme Court immediately after the vote, captioned "SC VOTES 5-4 TO CUT AFL-CIO DOWN" underneath. The President felt his grin grow wider.\n\nSure, the union bastards got away in the end. But they also left behind a waterfall of blood as they shambled away to wherever dark crevasse they'd come from. He took another sip from his mug -- slightly bitter, just the right amount of sweet. He can live with a flavor like that.\n\n"What do you mean, Speed?" the President inquired. "We'll do what we've been doing ever since I made the Oval Office my bedroom."\n\n"The Court didn't do enough. Who's to say they won't get back up again?" The Director swigged half his coffee in one gulp, before setting it aside.\n\n"With the penalties coming their way, and the other laws besides? They'll be lucky to make it past the end of the century." Barry continued, "The message got across, that's what matters. We'll come for the rest of them soon enough.""

This time he added twice the sugar and thrice the cream to the mug, before pouring boiling water to mix. Hot mocha seemed appropriate for starting a very promising day -- a little treat every now and then never hurt anybody.\n\nHe had every reason to treat himself, really. If bringing down the fattest socialist hydra in America didn't at least deserve a sugar rush on his part, then why bother celebrating anything at all?\n\nLast night's celebrations still struck vivid images in his mind. Good cheers rang throughout the White House as rich vintages, reserved only for special occasions, flowed the length of its hallways like life-giving rivers. His staff unstuck themselves from that one moment of disbelief upon hearing the decision by hugging and kissing each other as if Christmas Eve and New Years put together had come. He joined in of course. If the kids can have their fun, then so can this old timer with all the stress to burn.\n\nBarry allowed himself a gulp of rich, creamy hot mocha. Of course there'd be fallout; he heard fallout shouting and chanting slogans even from the comfort of his kitchen, sounding like gouts of fire sweeping a crackling inferno across DC. He can start putting fires out after getting prepared for another day in the White House. But for now?\n\nThe President downed the rest of his coffee with one flick of the wrist.

After mere days of planning and observation, a clandestine break-in of an office building evinced the corruption President Goldwater railed against: gifts to fellow union bosses, membership fees "creatively deducted" from annual earnings reports, officers buying twice what they make in a month. The subsequent leak to the media from a "concerned insider" made certain of the union's demise from both public shame and public lawsuits."

None of them bode well for Goldwater.\n\nIt began, according to testimony, when a guard working the night shift in the American Federation of Teachers building at New Jersey Avenue spotted unusual lights coming from one of the fifth floor facade windows. The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office. Drawers gaped open, now emptier without their paper -- but their more valuable effects were left virtually untouched. Cubicle after cubicle of upended folders and undisturbed paper bills. By now the guard was befuddled and confused; just what were the thieves looking for?\n\nAfter switching the lights on, however, he then noticed gold glimmering half-beneath the sea of crisp, white letter paper. Brushing aside the sheafs, he picked it up.\n\nThus, at 1:13 in the early morning, the Metropolitan Police Department woke up to a security guard with an FBI badge held by a shaky vice grip. Thirty minutes later, every news station in the country woke up to an MPD statement that said FBI agents unlawfully entered the AFL compound at midnight. Five hours later, two hundred million Americans woke up to headlines, in bold, flashing print, that said the FBI had burgled a labor union."

Finally, he responded: "Get me Schmidt. Tell him to stop whatever he's doing and come here at once." At this command, the orderly gave him a quick salute and departed the office immediately.\n\nA furrowed brow was the only indication of the fury building within Speer's heart. After all his valiant effort towards detente with the Americans, this new president was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office. The concerned look on his face as he saluted indicated that he was clearly already aware of the situation. "You asked to see me, my Führer?"\n\n"The Americans have restored the embargo.

He supposed it was only a matter of time before they came protesting about the embargo, though he wished it had not come during his brief respite.\n\nHelmut Schmidt was a curious character. Despite his nation's poor diplomatic reputation, the man seemingly oozed a calm sort of confidence. Irrespective of the animosity between their nations, Schmidt was cordial as he spoke at length with McNamara.\n\n"Mr. McNamara, speaking on behalf of Führer Albert Speer and the Greater German Reich, I implore your government to reconsider this course of action. There is much benefit to be had from trade between our two great nations, I'm sure you understand. I am willing to personally travel to negotiate with your president, in the interests of normalizing diplomatic relations once again."\n\nWithin hours of this phone call, McNamara sat in the Oval Office, recounting the discussion to President Goldwater. "The Germans seem willing to parley with us, but the American public expects us to uphold our promises and stop trade with the fascists," McNamara concluded. "I told him I would call him back with your response shortly. What do you want me to say, Mr. President?"\n\nGoldwater thought for a moment. It was certain that America held the upper hand. Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra.

German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n"The Americans aren't taking us seriously." He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. "They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously."\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. "Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them."\n\nThere was silence at the table. "Pardon, my Führer?" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. "We can arrange a meeting. In neutral territory; perhaps Switzerland?

This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country."\n\n"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet."\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called "master race" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."

Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world.

"Cancel my appointments for the week," he instructed his secretary as he passed, "and have someone pack my travel essentials."\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt.

As the plane approached landing, the Secret Service agents aboard began hurriedly running through procedure one more time, and for the first time President Goldwater began to grow nervous. Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet," he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute.

The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. "How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?" asked Speer.\n\n"Pleasant," replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. "I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?"\n\n"Indeed, indeed." As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."
 GLD.Speer.8.a:0 "I swear to you, things are changing!"
 GLD.Speer.8.b:0 "Surely the OFN gets a choice?"
 GLD.Speer.8.c:0 "You are a bold and wise man, Goldwater."


 GLD.Speer.9.t:0 "Sins of the Fathers"
 GLD.Speer.9.desc:0 "After the clicking of the press cameras and the heavy footfalls of their combined security entourage had faded away, Goldwater and Speer now found themselves alone (barring their respective translators) in the designated hotel room, with their security details waiting outside. The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Goering to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world." Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."
 GLD.Speer.9.a:0 "You have done much good, but..."
 GLD.Speer.9.b:0 "You are a self-serving bag of excuses! We're done!"


 GLD.Speer.10.t:0 "The Door to the Face"
 GLD.Speer.10.desc:0 ""...and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world."\n\nSpeer waited as his translator relayed his words to the President. He noted two things. The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany."\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."
 GLD.Speer.10.a:0 "The pot calls the kettle black, Mr. Goldwater."
 GLD.Speer.10.b:0 "Are you serious? This was a waste of time."


 GLD.Speer.11.t:0 "A Retort"
 GLD.Speer.11.desc:0 ""You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany."\n\nAs Goldwater's translator relayed his words to Speer, the Führer's face grew increasingly aghast. Goldwater actually had to suppress a laugh. He had caught Speer out on his hypocrisy, and as soon as he got back to America he would regale the press with how the Führer sputtered and stumbled and came up with a thousand excuses for the continuation of his regime. He could already picture the headlines, the documentaries, the inevitable historical significance of -\n\nSpeer laughed. Not a laugh of nervousness or fear, but of amusement. Speer began speaking, his brow cocked slightly as he spoke, and Goldwater found himself suddenly on edge as he awaited the translation.\n\n"You are clearly committed to your ideals of democracy, Mr. Goldwater. Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please."\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree? Attempting to keep his cool, Goldwater began to consider conceding Speer's point. Or perhaps, to prevent further unfortunate lines of questioning, he should end the session here."
 GLD.Speer.11.a:0 "...oh. He has a point."
 GLD.Speer.11.b:0 "I... you... what?! No, we're done here!"


 GLD.Speer.12.t:0 "The German Sidestep"
 GLD.Speer.12.desc:0 "After the clicking of the press cameras and the heavy footfalls of their combined security entourage had faded away, Goldwater and Speer now found themselves alone (barring their respective translators) in the designated hotel room, with their security details waiting outside. The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n"Mr. Goldwater, I understand that our nations have had a historically strained relationship, and I will not attempt to alter that perception today. What I would instead propose is that you leave your allied nations out of it. The rest of your Organisation of Free Nations should be permitted to trade with Germany if they so wish."\n\nAs Speer's translator finished relaying his words, Goldwater immediately scowled. "Is this why you brought me here today? So that you could propose sidestepping my authority and slipping into the western markets through the backdoor?" He leaned forwards before Speer had a chance to speak up. "Listen to me, Mr. Speer. I vowed to my people that I would shut fascism out of the Organisation of Free Nations. I must emphasise - Free nations, Mr. Speer. As long as your people continue to goosestep their way into the darkness, I will uphold that vow."\n\nSpeer stuttered as he tried to respond. "I have done much to bring Germany into modernity! Even a man like you must see that-"\n\nGoldwater stood, a dark look taking his face. "A man like me? And what do you mean by that? Do you insult me as an American? Or perhaps you refer to the fact that my father was a Jew? Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Speer?" As the Führer stumbled for words, the President scoffed. "I can't believe I agreed to come here. You are no different to your beloved Hitler. Good day, Mr. Speer." With nary another word, he turned and stormed bitterly from the room."
 GLD.Speer.12.a:0 "What nonsense. We're done here."


 GLD.Speer.13.t:0 "The Unlikeliest Deal"
 GLD.Speer.13.desc:0 "Goldwater had expected to come to Geneva to show Speer who was boss. Instead, they were now making a deal.\n\nSpeer, somehow, had convinced him. While the specifics of the agreement would still need to be formally ratified, the embargo would soon be significantly loosened and trade would flow once again between the OFN and the Unity-Pakt. Goldwater wondered how exactly congress and the voters would respond to this development, and even as they began to depart he wondered if it was too late to back out. \n\nAs the President and the Führer stood in the hotel foyer, Speer turned to Goldwater and offered a handshake for the second and final time. "This was a productive meeting, Mr. Goldwater. I look forward to future dialogue with the United States".\n\nGoldwater paused as he returned the handshake. Shaking hands with a man whose country would consider someone of Jewish blood like himself as less than human still felt troubling. "This was more... diplomatic than I was expecting. Thank you for your time". With that, the two men departed the hotel for their respective return trips.\n\nGoldwater had a lot of time to think as his flight made its journey back to America. What would he say to the press? How would the party respond to his unexpected u-turn? What was his own take away from all of this? This had certainly not been the trip he had anticipated, and he was unsure if he would ever feel completely at ease about it. It was all making his head spin. Whatever else happened, he dearly hoped that this would be the only time he would ever meet Albert Speer."
 GLD.Speer.13.a:0 "Let's never do this again."

 GLD.Speer.14.t:0 "The Door Lies Open"
 GLD.Speer.14.desc:0 "Speer felt confident, proud even, as he sat in his jet back to Germania. He had come to Geneva with the most bold, longshot diplomatic overture Germany had made in a hundred years and come out on top. Goldwater had agreed to loosen the embargo and German business would surely breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nFor years, Germany had asserted its might through military dominance, yet Speer had now proved that they could also stand up in a war of words. That Goldwater, a man who had taken power on a platform of anti-fascist opposition and anti-German sentiment, had been convinced of the error of his ways was a great victory for the Reich - and for world trade as a whole.\n\nAs he returned to Germania, he was first greeted by Schmidt. "An excellent display, my Führer!" said Schmidt as he pushed a copy of the morning paper into his hands. The headline celebrated Germany's diplomatic coup, hailing Speer's overpowering of the USA's decision. It was a little embellished, as all German media tended to be, but Speer supposed it would do.\n\nAs he returned to his duties as Führer, Speer felt satisfied that he had proven his worth and demonstrated his new path for Germany. The time for tanks charging across Europe was over; now was the time for the Reich to take its place on the world stage as a true diplomatic player."
 GLD.Speer.14.a:0 "The pen is mightier than the Panzer."

 GLD.Speer.100.t:0 "The Door Creaks Closed"
 GLD.Speer.100.desc:0 "Despite it all, Speer had failed. Goldwater had had enough and the world's press was already awash with the images of him storming angrily from the hotel, Speer himself emerging regretfully a while afterwards. He was not terribly surprised - the talks had been a long-shot after all - but he was disappointed all the same.\n\nThe condolences from Schmidt and the assertion by the German press that the failure was entirely the fault of the unreasonable and arrogant Americans did little to sooth his gloominess as he arrived back in Germania. The ceaseless messages from the major conglomerates lamenting their lost foreign assets left him gloomier still. He had failed. A man in his position could not afford failure. Weakness in the face of the tasks that still lay ahead for Germany was unacceptable.\n\nSitting at his desk, he considered where Germany might go from here. A relief package to dampen the woes of affected businesses was a given. A meeting with the economic bigwigs to determine alternate trade partners would also be essential. Yet no matter what, this failure would hang over his head for a long time. Securing free trade with the west had been one of his greatest diplomatic achievements. Now he had lost that and lost face all at once. It seemed that America and Germany were destined to be enemies."
 GLD.Speer.100.a:0 "Curse that Goldwater!"

 GLD.Speer.103.t:0 "A Predictable Outcome"
 GLD.Speer.103.desc:0 "The talks had failed. Though it had been Speer's own idea, the world's media was already awash with images of Speer marching frustrated from the hotel. The images of Goldwater emerging moments later showed a face tinged with equal parts irritation and smugness. That was exactly how he felt as he flew home over the Atlantic. It was a wasted journey, but at least he had made Speer look like a fool.\n\nWhen Goldwater arrived back in America, he found himself quickly swept before the journalists, all eager to hear his account of things. He smiled for the cameras, and waited for the hubbub to die down before speaking.\n\n"Mr. Speer is no different to his predecessor, nor any of those who tried to claim Germany in the past. He believes that his country deserves all the bounty of the free world without being a part of that free world. I tried to be reasonable, and I decided to hear him out in the interests of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, it is clear that even under its new ruler, the ego of the German nation knows no bounds.\n\n"Let this be a lesson to all those who rule with an iron fist. If you are willing to extend liberty, then liberty will extend its bounty unto you. If not, then the bounty shall forever be denied."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a smile as he returned to the White House. He had kept his promise to the American people, shown up the forces of fascism, and demonstrated once and for all that America would always stand tall in the face of tyranny. It would surely be a great precedent for the future of the world - and for the future of his election prospects."

It's not right, it's not American, and President Goldwater is on the case!

We fought for American liberty, for the very American Dream which earned us our independence; however, now all we can find is the sorrow of defeat within the Presidency, and a lesser and lesser chance at reelection as thoughts towards the future echo throughout the President's mind..."

Whilst the Supreme Court did not fully obliterate the AFL-CIO, it did manage to create several impositions against the powers of the Unions and how much they can hamper large American businesses.

Finally, we shall undo the curses of corruption upon the American market that the extremely bloated and overzealous union organizations brought upon it, and bring about a new era of shiny, golden prosperity for all the hardworking American patriots throughout the country!"
