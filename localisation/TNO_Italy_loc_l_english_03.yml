 CD.1.t:0 "The Domus Mariae Congress" # Domus Mariae
 CD.1.d:0 "Now that the post-victory euphoria has subsided, the Democrazia Cristiana must actually begin the work of governing a country that has been steeped in fascism for decades. What's more, the problem with big-tent parties is that the many different factions within the party have different ideas as to what that governing should entail.\n\nRealizing this, incoming prime minister Aldo Moro, himself a progressive but also a pragmatist, has called for a party congress at the Domus Mariae Hotel in Rome, in order to determine how he will take the party forward into this new era for Italy.\n\nIn the hotel's conference room, party leaders and officials bandy words as they make their case for why their vision for Italy is the best path for the party, whilst Moro looks on from the center of the front table.\n\nThe frontmen of the liberal conservative Dorotei faction, Mariano Rumor and Emilio Colombo, speak at length about the need for unity, and that the party must not rock the boat too much right off the bat. After all, the party wants to 'stay' in government, and Rome wasn't built in a day. To say nothing of the fact that many DC MPs, and the DC voting base, skew conservative.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, progressive firebrand and close confidant of Moro, Amintore Fanfani, gives an impassioned sermon on the need for reform NOW, emphasizing the threat posed by Italy's ally-turned-enemy to the north. Italy must be strong and free, and there is no time for an incremental approach.\n\nAs the speeches wind down, Moro stands up, causing silence in the room. Deep in thought, Moro clears his throat, then turns and begins walking towards the table of. . ."

 CD.2.d:0 "To run with the hare, and hunt with the hounds.\n\nAldo Moro has made the decision to hear out the large, influential conservative faction of Democrazia Cristiana. After all, DC is, at its core, a party of the center. To go too far in one direction or another will only lead to splintering. People say you can't please everyone, but that does not mean we can't try to please as many as possible!\n\nHowever, whilst the policy of fence-sitting and never making a clear choice has worked well until now, Moro must now make a choice of his own. How should DC govern and work in parliament?\n\nSome argue that the best way forward is to make the already big tent of DC even bigger. By cutting deals with the various small parties in parliament and bringing them into the coalition, Moro can broaden DC's appeal and make it so that it is far easier to STAY in government. However, this would undoubtedly end up diluting DC's agenda and legislative program.\n\nHowever, DC is big enough that it could potentially go it alone as a 'Party of Catholics'. By unifying the party from within, Moro can make it stronger and a more cohesive whole. This means that, without having to make as many concessions to the smaller parties, DC can implement its agenda without interference. This will mean a more effective legislative program. Of course, this also means that it will be harder to REMAIN in government, as DC's appeal will not be as broad.\n\nWhat is the best path forward?"

 CD.3.t:0 "Approaching the Monarchists" # attempt attackment with Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity
 CD.3.d:0 "The Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity, or PDIUM for short, is one of the many new Italian parties that have obtained seats in Parliament. While fairly small in comparison to the three major parties, every bit helps in our efforts to see our vision of Italy through to success. The PDIUM is a fairly conservative party, but what matters to them the most is the maintenance of the Italian Monarchy, which we have no reason to abolish.\n\nKnowing this, and combined with a few concessions, we can attach and are in the process of adding the PDIUM to our parliamentary coalition. The careful art of compromise that Aldo Moro has pulled off has even managed to leave the liberal side of our party content with the addition of a staunchly conserative party, leaving the unity of the DC strong even as it's voting bloc grows."

 CD.4.t:0 "A Conversation between Moderates" # attempt attackment with moderate socdems
 CD.4.d:0 "Aldo Moro lowered the cup of coffee to the table and stretched his legs under the desk. He had never doubted that Giuseppe Saragat would want to speak with him, and here they were now - the Social Democrat pretending to read the papers handed to him, and the Christian Democrat waiting patiently. Finally, Saragat nodded almost imperceptibly, and handed the papers back. The men's eyes met. Moro smiled and Saragat smiled back, a gleam in his eyes. "We will be able to cooperate with one another very well, Aldo, and I should have no trouble getting my people to accept," said Saragat finally. "That is excellent to hear, Giuseppe," Moro returned. He offered him a cigarette and the other accepted, so that, with the business concluded in something like an hour, they had little more to do except become used to each other's company. "We are men of the same mind, Giuseppe," said Moro after a while. "You know I must keep company with some men, let's say, of a more conservative mindset than your own." Saragat laughed obligingly, and Moro pressed on. "Yet we have agreed something today which will shape Italy for better. And so the hardliners matter little. I would enjoy hearing what Signoro Nenni has to say once he learns of this meeting."\n\nSaragat grinned, indulging his interlocutor. "Nenni always has something to say, it's what I admire in him," he said quietly. Then something else appeared in his eyes. "But what good will that do Nenni? When next I meet him I will vote against the Fronte Democratico, as we agreed, and you will be Prime Minister." Moro smiled at this, but a shadow seemed to fall over the conversation. It hung in the air for a second, as Moro observed his partner closely. Giuseppe Saragat was a gentleman in every way, and one of the more soft spoken politicians he'd dealt with. And yet there was something about him. Moro understood that if ever the tide turned against the Christian Democrats, Saragat would abandon the 'little compromise' between them without a second thought.\n\nThen Saragat was smiling again, and the moment passed. A few cigarettes and some small talk later, and the two men were shaking hands over the desk. "Thank you for the conversation, Aldo," said Saragat. "Thank you for agreeing to meet," said Moro, and smilingly led him out of the office."

 CD.5.t:0 "Relations with the Socialists" # political current, less hostility to socialists
 CD.5.d:0 "The decades of propaganda in Italy has fermented a certain discontent to socialism. Many older people see the socialists as anarchist bomb-throwers who seek to throw Italy into an anarchy like that of Russia, and even Ciano's regime was strictly anti-socialist. This has had the effect of making many of the more centrist and center-right people within the party deeply afraid of the threat of socialism. However, where some see adversity, Aldo Moro sees opportunity.\n\nThe socialists and even the vast majority of the FD as a whole are greatly preferable to the neo-fascists that comprise the BN, as the socialists are fairly committed as of now to the idea of democracy. Knowing this, Moro has seen fit to reach out a proverbial hand to the socialists to show to the populace that socialism is not an alien idology, but merely another faction of democracy.\n\nWhile reluctant at first, it seems that Moro's efforts have paid off, as even the more conservative parts of DC are willing to be more amicable with the various socialists throughout Italy,opening up the possibility for us to work with the socialists more closely in the future."

 CD.6.t:0 "Primavera" # Primavera 
 CD.6.d:0 "The Primavera faction of the DC is, for lack of a better word, a thorn in our side. Their more conservative nature contrasts with the majority of the party, which stands in the center. In fact, they are fairly far to the right for the DC as a whole. However, despite these ideological differences, we should work with them all the same. They are a part of our party after all.\n\nThis was the general consensus among most of the higher ups in the DC, and when discussions began over coordination, most expected finding a consensus to be very difficult. However, to nearly everyone's surprise, the Primavera faction was incredibly willing to cooperate with the rest of the DC! More than that, the representatives from said faction were much more understanding of the nature of such a compromise than expected. While there have been concessions, such as DC support for some of their more moderate viewpoints, the surprisingly simple ending to this issue has left many in the DC happy."

 CD.7.t:0 "A Valuable Alliance" # catholic unions 
 CD.7.d:0 "The most important part of anyone is their values. If they have horrible values, they are horrible people and vice versa. This is why it is so important to make sure that everyone's values are kind and decent, so that the whole country doesn't fall to chaos. Values are easy enough to implement in a person, by teaching them throughout their childhood, but maintaining said values requires that said person is supported by institutions that embody these values. This is where the Catholic unions come in.\n\nThese unions, primarily CISL, represent everything that a good Catholic worker should aspire to. Furthermore, they promote the strong Catholic values that we as a nation must strive to represent. Thankfully, the Catholic Unions are nowhere near weak, and are contenders in their own rights for the most powerful unions of Italy. We must cement our relations with these unions so that we can completely align ourselves with the proper ideas for our future!"

 CD.8.t:0 "High Spirits" # high spirits, bless the CD
 CD.8.d:0 "An odd feeling has come over the Italian people. It seems to have spread to nearly everyone, conserative or liberal. It is neither fear, or anger, but happiness. Happiness at the newly forged Italian democracy, but most importantly, happiness at the DC.\n\nOur efforts in governance have paid off tenfold, as public opinion towards the DC have skyrocketed to incredibly high levels. The hopes and morals of our rank-and-file are at a similarly high level, as large numbers of people join the DC, and talk to everyone they know about the good they've done for Italy. Our successful efforts have even led to some of our opposition in the BN and FD to reluctantly admit that we are a competent and respectable option for Italy.This infectious optimism towards the DC seems poised to last a long time, and we have every intention of making sure that there will be no reason for it to fade."

 CD.9.t:0 "The New Classroom" # catholic tradition based??
 CD.9.d:0 "As young Pietro walked into his classroom on the first day of the school year, he could not help but notice something different.\n\nThe previous year, to say the classroom had been shabby would have been very charitable. But now, it was as though a metamorphosis had occurred. The room was spotless. The formerly bare bookshelves were now filled with books! Even the desks for pupils, which had been falling apart before, looked like they could actually support the weight of a child!\n\nPietro walked up to the teacher's desk. "Mr. Cirulli," he asked, "where did all this come from?"\n\nMr. Cirulli beamed from ear to ear as he looked down at the young boy. "Why, Pietro, it came from the Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori! They have been doing a grand campaign to provide underprivileged schools like ours with the supplies they need to give young Italians like you the education you deserve! Where do you think your parents got your new shoes and books? They certainly couldn't afford to buy them themselves!"\n\nPietro looked down at his shoes. It was true; the shoes were brand new, well-made, and even somewhat stylish! Considering his previous shoes had been falling to pieces at the seams, it was a most welcome surprise when his ecstatic parents had presented him with the new shoes. And the books in his backpack were certainly too expensive for his working-class parents to afford on their own.\n\n"The CISL did all this?"\n\n"Indeed, my boy! That's what motivated me to join the CISL myself! I'm sure your parents feel much the same themselves!"""

 CD.10.t:0 "An Era of Good Feelings" # pluralism epic.
 CD.10.d:0 "It was an era of good feelings, the mayor had said in one of their discussions, where Italians felt they could change things for the better. Elena did not like the mayor very much, but she could agree with him on that. Ever since she had gone round the building and roped in all of the neighbours, the Condominium B7 Administration Group had become the talk of the entire neighbourhood.\n\nShe had always been outspoken, even as a girl, but only in the past year or so had the neighbours become so as well. The Group, composed mostly of the women living in the building, had been scorned at first by many of the husbands. Then the Group organised a few lunches, solved the problem of waste disposal outside the condominium, convinced the owner to shell out money for maintenance of the property and received the mayor of the district, twice. The husbands stopped complaining.\n\nElena knew the change that had come over her lady friends was neither sudden nor random. Even under Ciano they would not have dared raise such a fuss or involve themselves in politics, however minor. With democracy, however, they had been free to take much of the everyday 'policymaking' into their hands. There were still whispers in neighbouring buildings that she had nothing better to do with her time, but Elena didn't care. She had discovered that organising her peers gave her purpose, and she would not give it up no matter what anyone said. Maybe when the children were slightly older - who knows - she could replace the district mayor and do his job better."

 CD.11.t:0 "The Sad Decline of Catholic Politics" # democratic initiative
 CD.11.d:0 "Sundays were a dual disappointment for him now. Paolo's routine was known to all in the neighbourhood. After looking after the small garden he had improvised with his wife behind the house, he would go with her to the morning Mass before they parted ways; she to her friends in the grocery shops and he to his at the small cafe in the church square. After speaking with them for a while he would buy his two usual newspapers, kept aside for him behind the counter, and sit down absorbed in reading for the rest of the morning.\n\nHe had stuck to this routine for years, but things were no longer the same. The parish priest he remembered since his childhood was old and approaching senility - the poor man sometimes stopped, confused, in the middle of his sermons and seemed lost. His sermons used to rouse Paolo's faith, but now there were only the awkward silences until an altar boy led the old priest mercifully away.\n\nPaolo had expected, with the DC's victory in the election, that politics would be made with the religious fervour he still carried in his heart. He voted for Democrazia Cristiana because he believed a party of the real Italy - Italians raised, like him, in the bosom of Azione Cattolica - could carry the day. But everyday now he read that Aldo Moro - the deceitful coward, Moro - was working with agnostics and socialists. Today the paper spoke of 'Iniziativa Democratica', an alliance Moro had just announced with the Left of the party and whoever he carried with him from the centre. Paolo was angry not only at Moro, who had sabotaged Catholic politics, but at the 'men of values' in the party who let him get away with it.\n\nHe left the newspaper on the table and went back to his house. He had not given up on Democrazia Cristiana yet - who else could he vote for? But the fervour with which he spoke for them in the past had withered away long ago."

 CD.12.d:0 "Young Giuseppe could scarcely believe it.\n\nEver since childhood, he had been brought up on the great Cinecittà films. Films like Umberto D., Le Notti Bianche, and Bicycle Thieves. And ever since childhood, he had dreamt of making films for Cinecittà himself.\n\n"Oi, Giuseppe! Where's my coffee? Muoviti!"\n\nGiuseppe jolted out of his daydream as the sharp voice of Federico Fellini struck across the studio. "Y-yes, sir! Coming right up!"\n\nGiuseppe had never thought this day would come. That he would be working in the same studio as the great director Frederico Fellini, on a sure-to-be great film, Satyricon! Alongside such great actors as Salvo Randone! It was truly a dream come true.\n\nWhilst it was true that Giuseppe was mostly just fetching coffee and doing other grunt work, that would not last forever. He was young, and his time would come. For now, he was just happy to be able to work alongside directors and actors whom he idolized, on films that he adored. Even if he was just a peon for now, it was a toe in the door, made possible by the subsidies to Cinecittà. If they had not had those subsidies, would they have had the money to hire him?"

 CD.13.d:0 ""Here's your change of 1000 lire, signor. Thank you and have a great day!"\n\nMario looked down at the change the cashier handed him, which was only two 500 lire banknotes. His brow could not help but furrow as he put the notes in his wallet.\n\nMario was an economist. He had already been skeptical of the government's plan to introduce new denominations of 500 lire banknotes when the government had announced the plan. He claimed that this plan would only lead to, at best, further inflating the already-inflated lira. At worst, he claimed, it could lead to an economic bubble.\n\nAnd all bubbles must eventually burst.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of the skepticism expressed by economists such as Mario, the government had decided to go ahead with the plan and print the new banknotes. Now that they were being widely circulated, it seemed certain that they were here to stay, and the lira would be further inflated. Whilst this had increased spending and consumption, could it continue like this forever?\n\nMario did not want a bubble. He honestly hoped he was wrong, and that this project would be a success like the government claimed. But he could not shake the feeling that it was inflating a bubble, and that the bubble would inevitably pop."

As he was observing the preparations, a young boy approached him.\n\n"Signor," the boy asked, "why are we having this feast?"\n\nGiovanni continued to beam as he kneeled next to the young boy. "Why, my lad, haven't you heard? We're celebrating! Now that the government has abolished metayage, we are now free men! No more sharecropping! We can keep our produce! We own our land! And it's all thanks to the government! Now take a seat, and celebrate!", as he ushered the child to the table.\n\nGiovanni had long been a farmer in the Calabrian village of Stilo. Long had he slaved away under the metayage system, being forced to give his hard-grown crops to a landlord in exchange for the privilege of being able to use their land.\n\nHe had never dreamt that this day would come. The day where this accursed system would be abolished, and that he could keep his own crops, grown on his own land.\n\nAs he sat down at the head of the table, ready to dig in to a succulent meal, he made sure to remember who it was who had made this happen.

What are you talking about, Isadora?"\n\nThe young girl's grin widened further. "Come with me!", she said, as she grabbed Matteo's hand and pulled him along to the village square, as the sun started its descent below the horizon.\n\nAs they reached the square, Matteo noticed a new addition. Around the square, there were thin pillars, each one with a grey orb at the top.\n\n"Well, those pillars look nice, Isadora. But was it really worth dragging me here for? They don't seem too special!"\n\n"Just wait a few minutes!", Isadora said as her grin refused to subside, and the sun continued its slow descent.\n\nMatteo sat on a bench next to his friend, wondering what on Earth could be this special. And after about ten minutes of waiting, something truly wondrous happened.\n\nThe orbs at the top of the pillars suddenly lit up!\n\nYoung Matteo almost fell out of the bench as he looked with his jaw agape. "Isadora!? What the hell just happened!?"\n\nIsadora's grin was from ear to ear at this point. "Isn't it amazing!? The grownups said this was called electricity. I don't really get it, but isn't this cool!?"\n\nMatteo didn't respond. He just stared in wonder at the glowing orbs."

I'll be able to get the conservatives to support our programme one way or the other. You just need to give the green light, and without restraints I will be able to herd them into supporting us, by any means necessary."\n\n"Perhaps," Moro responded, "but that will undoubtedly make it harder for our party to be re-elected if your plan of coercion and implied expulsion from the party goes ahead. I want to keep this in-house as much as possible too, but we must think of the future elections. Working with Nenni on a common reform programme will certainly make it easier on that front."\n\n"Aldo, come on. You and I both know that if we constantly fret about not rocking the boat for the sake of the next election, nothing will ever get done. We both know the threat from the north necessitates action NOW. Just give the word, and I shall make it happen."\n\nMoro's brow continued to furrow as he stopped walking to ponder Fanfani's words. Whilst Fanfani was certainly speaking both their minds, it was his duty as party leader to ensure his party's electoral success, just as it was his duty as prime minister to ensure Italy's future. Working with a Nenni who has displayed openness to working with him would perhaps be the best path for both DC and Italy? What to do, what to do...\n\nAfter several minutes deep in thought, Moro turned to Fanfani, and said to him..."

That island is Democrazia Cristiana. As the other parties bicker both with each other and with themselves, our party holds firm. We are strong. We are unified. We are above such petty squabbling and factionalism. The average Italian can trust us to stay the course and steer the ship through these turbulent seas, without any of this bickering and factionalist nonsense.\n\nThat isn't to say we don't have our own divisions and factions.

 CD.18.d:0 "Aldo Moro stepped up to the podium and looked over his people as the Speaker called the House to attention. A sea of Democrazia Cristiana's representatives looked back at him, men of every shade of political persuasion, from reformed fascists and monarchists to those different from the moderate socialist bloc only by their chosen affiliation. Moro could not suppress a twinge of pride in this wide tent they had built, and then his eyes met those of Giulio Andreotti. Guilio smiled at him and nodded, encouraging, demanding. Democrazia Cristiana was by far the widest of the coalitions present in Parliament, but - Moro exhaled slowly and steeled himself - today it would become narrower.\n\n"I am proud because I am a Christian democrat," he began. "Our fellow representatives in the other parties are divided between themselves and speak only for parts of the society. This is their right." The usual heckling, sounds of approval from every DC faction represented. Moro continued speaking. "Christian democracy is a representation of the whole of our society. Before God we build a politics, every day, founded in our religious and social values and which will better the life of every Italian family. Some of our opponents, looking for something to attack us for, say we compromise excessively and do not stand by what we claim to be our beliefs." Already the Parliamentarians started to react accordingly, but Moro kept going. "Yet we know what our beliefs are. Democrazia Cristiana is.." He almost faltered. "A party for democracy, unity and values, and opposed to the destructiveness and division of the Left."\n\nAs the Parliament broke out in whispers, Moro narrowed his eyes at the paper laying before him on the podium. Mentally he made immediate adjustments, crossing out 'a malicious atheist attack on the family', 'assassins of democracy', substituting 'against our families' beliefs', 'misguided beliefs which can only harm democracy'. Aldo Moro looked up and threw a surveying glance around the room. Andreotti and the Primavera group nodding approvingly, the left faction looking angry and whispering while shooting daggers with their eyes. The Fronte Democratico representatives, ready to stand up and start shouting but curious to see how the speech would develop. The PSDI, sitting among them, looking more intrigued than angry. And across from the leftists, Almirante, flashing him a full toothed grin which sent a shiver down his spine. Moro kept going.\n\n"We stand against the Fronte Democratico, against the Left, because their beliefs are against our families' beliefs. They are not what Italy wants or needs, and whilst there are good men among them," Another edit, a slight grimace from Andreotti - "It is clear that their beliefs are badly misguided, and will only do harm to our young democracy. Perhaps they will call us conservative for saying so, opposed to reform, but we are the true reformers. Democrazia Cristiana represents the true centre of Italy, the soul of tens of millions of Italians and their families. Based on our values, and their values, and willing to fight the Left on the political battlefield, we will change Italy for the better and give its children a life better even than what we ourselves will enjoy."\n\nUproarious applause from Andreotti's corner, with every conservative member of the party on their feet clapping. Almirante and his fascists whistling and applauding, only half mockingly. The members of the Fronte Democratico jeering, calling him a Big Business puppet, an enemy of the worker and a fascist, while Saragat's moderates whispered quickly to one another. But Moro did not have eyes for any of them. He looked only at the leftists of Democrazia Cristiana, and noted how they sat there sullenly with anger in their eyes. Betrayal. Moro left the podium and went back to his seat, shaking hands and smiling absent-mindedly. Andreotti clapped him on the back and said, into his ear, "We have won a great victory today.""

They claim that they are absolutely not fascist and that they respect the democracy of this new Italy, but those claims could charitably be described as 'dubious at best'.\n\nThey have opposed our government at every turn. However, there is a way we could neuter the threat posed by them.\n\nThere is a significant contingent of monarchists in the BN, who like their conservatism and authoritarianism, whilst caring less about the whole fascism thing. Though obviously, their primary concern is the preservation of the Italian monarchy.\n\nWe can use this to our advantage and sow division in the ranks of the BN. We shall spread rumors (which may have merit, for all we know) that the BN seeks to restore fascism, and abolish the monarchy in the process! We could say they seek to do this as 'revenge' against Umberto for his part in the democratization of Italy.\n\nBy planting this rumor, true or not, in the mind of the monarchists, we will wreak havoc on the BN unity. We can exploit this division to prevent the BN from interfering with our government - or democracy for that matter. We could even potentially bring them to our side, by boasting about how DC is the party of the monarchy; we respect King Umberto, and unlike the BN, we shall leave him right where he is!"

If someone tells him something else, he changes his mind! It's insufferable! He has no principles!" Federico folded his arms over his chest. There was something defensive in the gesture. "We're both socialists, Tano, but you know in your head that the Democristiani have done good for us." To this, Tano's eyes widened - Guido could see it from where he stood. "The Democristiani have done good for themselves!" Tano was speaking at the top of his voice. "The problem with 'socialists' like you is you're only too willing to bend over for the establishment!" To this the other man, face redder still, shouted something about bending over his colleague's wife.\n\nGuido shook his head and lowered his eyes to his work.

The subject of discussion was a sheet of paper, hand-delivered by a trusted go-between for Democrazia Cristiana. There were only a few words printed on it: 'Wait. We will have our day. You will be contacted when anything changes.' Once he had read it aloud and looked around the room, the General folded the paper and placed it into his pocket. There was a silence for some time.\n\n"I knew Giulio to be more decisive," said one of the men, finally. His voice was burdened, and he met with murmured assent. "Yet we must wait, as he said. We either act correctly or we do not act at all, and even the Military cannot move unless the politics is in place." To this more murmurs, and not all of them assent. One of the men suggested sending a reply to the DC office the letter had arrived from, but the first one to speak shook his head." We must trust that our friends know what they are doing," he said with finality. "Do you think any of us must enjoy this, being insulted everyday by a Government which spits in Italy's face? But we must endure it. And once we have endured enough, then and only then will we proceed." The room stirred somewhat, placated. The man who had spoken seemed to have swayed the gathering, but even he had his doubts. He hoped that Giulio would soon send another letter, with a different message."

Shhh, it's about to start!"\n\nMaria pouted. Politics were dreadfully boring to a young child. But she reluctantly sat down on the sofa in between her parents, as on the television Aldo Moro walked up to the podium.\n\nBut today would be no ordinary speech.\n\nAldo Moro was no stranger to political theatre. But today, he was more animated, determined, and resolute than anyone had ever seen him before. One could feel the passion emanating from the TV as he called for Italy to achieve its rightful greatness. Not merely on the world stage, but at home, too. Italy must be a country that Italians are proud to call home! The status quo had to go, and a new, greater Italy must rise!\n\nAngelo and his wife, Allegra, could not help but be transfixed and captivated by Moro's performance. Wide-eyed, they could not even tear their gaze away from the television for a fraction of a second! Even little Maria could not help but be a bit taken in by it all, even if she would rather be watching Provlino.\n\nAldo Moro was clearly in it to win it.\n\nAs Moro concluded his seminal speech, Angelo looked to Allegra. "Well dear. I think I know who we're voting for.""

 CD.23.t:0 "Establishment of the Regioni" # regioni established
 CD.23.d:0 "In a nation as great and expansive as Italy, one of the greatest concerns is one that may seem drab and boring: the matter of administration. After the unification of Italy in 1861, the administrative divisions were kept small, consisting of Comuni (municipalities) and provinces (groups of Comuni).\n\nThis was all well and good, but our glorious nation has grown tremendously since then. This has necessitated more Comuni and provinces, and it has lead to the national government having to micromanage hundreds of different divisions, which is frankly nightmarish to administer. Hence the introduction by the Democrazia Cristiana government of a new administrative division: Regioni.\n\nThese regioni will consist of groupings of provinces that share a common history and/or heritage. It will decentralize a small amount of power from the national government to the regioni, but it will minimize micromanagement and allow the government's laws to be applied uniformly. It's not quite full-on federalism, but by devolving some powers to the regioni it will strengthen our country.\n\nOf course, not everyone is happy about this. The more authoritarian-minded forces in parliament are outraged at the idea of devolving even the tiniest bit of power to regional governments. The Blocchi Nazionale in particular are beside themselves, with their leader, Almirante, filibustering parliament for a record eight consecutive hours! He makes outrageous claims that it will lead to Italy's disintegration into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany or the Serene Republic of Venice or what have you. But he is wrong, as this is the best for unity in Italy!"

The radicals, on the other hand, want to strongarm the rest of the Parliament to vote on their reforms, radically transforming Italy into a socialist state, something which, if not executed with caution, may trigger reactions from forces we know little about...\n\nThe choice is difficult, but we must decide: let the ballots speak!"

 FD.1.t:0 "A Writer's Conundrum" # XXV Congress, decision on SocDem or LibSoc empowering
 FD.1.d:0 "Enzio sat hunched over his desk. His notes laid out scattered all over the finely crafted wood, spilling over onto the polyester carpet. He had collected a copious amount of material on the two ideological giants battling it out for control over the Fronte Democratico. If he were to read them all off in succession, even the long-gone and long-winded Duce himself would keel over from boredom. All the same, Enzio knew he had to at least try to make something out of his literary collection.\n\nIn his interactions with Saragat, Enzio was taken back by how approachable the man was. His whole demeanor was very calming. He didn't yell or scream or shout ideological dogma at Enzio. Whatever question Enzio had related to the party's platform Saragat was more than willing to explain, in great detail, his outline for the future. From Enzio's perspective, he saw a man committed not only to himself, like so many other politicians. Saragat was committed to democracy and to the Italian people. An honorable man in a cut-throat field.\n\nNenni however, what a contrast. If Enzio felt a sense of paternal comfort around Saragat, Nenni represented a father's rage. Rage against the injustices still present within Italy and its government. Nenni also had no qualms preaching to Enzio about how socialism, and socialism alone, would save Italy from backsliding into fascism. While Enzio was not fully convinced by the rhetoric, he couldn't help but be inspired by Nenni's commitment to his ideals. A socialist Italy still seemed unimaginable, almost impossible with a gentleman like Saragat. But with a firebrand like Nenni at the helm...\n\nEnzio went back to peering over his notes, determined to finish his column before morning."

 FD.2.t:0 "Saragat Prevails" # Prima la Democrazia
 FD.2.d:0 "All of Rome today - or at least, the part of it with a taste for politics, which was everyone nowadays - could talk of nothing else. Giuseppe Saragat had prevailed in the factional struggle for control of the Fronte Democratico, and was named Secretary of the group, with Pietro Nenni to act as President.\n\nA moderate man, both in character and in his politics, Giuseppe Saragat had in the past years fostered a reputation of ruthless calculation. Having prevailed, members of the Saragat faction now exposed their internal disagreement in presenting two plans on the way forward to Nenni.\n\nThe first path was the more moderate one - working with Democrazia Cristiana directly, pooling the energy of the moderating forces in both the FD and the DC, and forming a social democratic government supported by Aldo Moro. Despite his willingness to sit with conservative and monarchist members in his group, Moro was a known compromiser, and a Nenni-Saragat-Moro pact could well achieve much for social democratic politics. Such a pact would also help reduce opposition from conservative elements in Italy, and strongly increase our ability to deliver an effective programme. The clear downside, however, would be the reaction in the Fronte Democratico. An alliance with Moro would be seen as a capitulation by many voters, badly damaging the FD's chance at reelection.\n\nThe other option was purer, and carried more risk. The path of socialist unity would have us form a government made only of the FD, creating a moderate left bloc which could implement our vision of Italy without any alliance with the Christian Democrats. This policy, for obvious reasons, would make our re-election far more likely - it is what people voted for, after all - and the healing of rifts in the socialist front would allow the government to work in stability. Yet the risk would have to be kept in mind. After all, conservative elements in the country would be disturbed by the prospect of a socialist bloc in power.\n\nWith the FD's factions waiting impatiently, Nenni finally came to a decision:"
 FD.2.a:0 "A Red-White alliance with Moro, for a stable and effective government." # Empower Strength, low reelection, meh terror

Nenni was the first to speak: "Not everyone in the party is happy we're meeting you," he said gruffly, and Moro met him with a small smile. A test? Then Nenni laughed, and they got to business.\n\nThe next few hours went by in a consistent manner - Nenni talked a good deal, Saragat talked less and said more, and Moro talked enough. By the end of it everything was as clear as could be and a coalition agreement was on the table. Moro was pleasantly surprised to note his interlocutors did not agree on everything. They all came away with something they could sell to their people, and parted with an appointment to meet again very soon.\n\nIt had gone well, Moro noted as he left the café. But Nenni had been reasonable, and every time he wasn't Saragat steered the conversation back to their areas of agreement. In any case, it was only compromising, and Moro had squeezed as much as he could. The easy part was over."

The goddamn Christian Democrats might as well have won the election, the way our programs are turning out. I am sick of compromising with these idioti!

It would have been one thing if this was the only point of compromise. Or even one of a few.

In a quickly arranged vote, the party ousted him as president and elected Ugo La Malfa in his place, with the latter immediately approving the PRI's entry into the coalition.

To a hushed gathering of his closest allies he had broken the news they were all expecting: the PdAz, having listened to the voters, would be dissolved for the greater good of socialism and freedom in Italy. Now all that remained would be to pack everything up and wait for the phone to ring.\n\nParri was not so cynical as to think the phone calls from Pietro Nenni and Giuseppe Saragat were dishonest. Both men, despite their differences, respected his struggle against fascism and had told him so in person. But he was not so naïve as to think this was the only reason they were calling. Depending on their beliefs the former members of the party would flock in two directions, the more radical to the PSI and the more moderate to the PSDI. Parri knew that the Left would be stronger, all in all, in having one less faction within it to compete with. But there was also something to mourn in the party's demise.

The memorandum states the cause of this expulsion was due to the ever-increasing radicalization of the left of the party, and its dissatisfaction with the "constant capitulation to the moderates and the Christian Democrats''. While Enrico Berlinger was not available for comment, many of his supporters, led by other party deputies who were also expelled, have taken to the streets in protest against the "political puppets of the bourgeoisie". Police units have been mobilized and are conveying at the scene of the largest protests currently taking place. Although they have been ordered to only watch and ensure the protests do not spiral out of control, it is clear that the Socialist's Party's decision to expel the radicals may not have had the stabilizing effect they were hoping for.\n\nPietro Nenni issued a statement on the matter, ensuring that these protests were made up of mostly foolish students with too much time on their hands and their irresponsible ringleaders; the expelled party members. He went on to express his confidence in the Party and made it clear "...in no uncertain terms... the party shall not split over the ravings and poutings of a few radicals."

He stood tall, chin out and chest-puffed.\n\n"That ought to bring the house down!" Nenni thought as he gasped for air, his voice cracked and his throat parched from spouting off rhetoric for the past 15 minutes. For days Nenni made sure every page, every paragraph, every sentence, and every syllable of his speech was perfect! He refused to recite nothing but his most truthful and analytical thoughts when speaking, especially on the topic of politics. If he was to secure Italian socialism against its political enemies, it was imperative Nenni built his support among the working class. The workers had to be made to understand the important role the PSI played in empowering them. Once they were made to see this, no doubt due to his impeccable oratory skills, the workers would unilaterally fall in line with the PSI party program. So when this crowd of workers gathered in the TV studio audience returned nothing more than a few whimpering whistles and scattered applause, Nenni could only stand aghast. Frozen in shock, like a deer in headlights, he regained enough courage to gather his papers and exit frame before the feed cut.\n\nNenni could not comprehend how his speech and charisma failed to inflame the workers' passions. Thankfully, Giuseppe Saragat made an appearance on the very same program and was able to win over the crowd's affection. Nenni pondered how Saragat, much more moderate and soft-spoken compared to himself, could have captured the hearts and minds of the working class assembled in the TV studio. And not just there either. All over the nation it seemed his fiery prose, meant to set hearts on fire, was overshadowed by Saragat's gentler and straight-talking attitude. It slowly dawned on Nenni that he was slowly but surely becoming an accessory to the real rising star of the party, Guiseppe Saragat."

Something about the importance of reaching out and gathering allies in solidarity. Roberto's hand ached from spending the last couple hours diligently and methodically recording as much as he could at the opening Italian congress. He had already run through two pens, and now with the last drop of ink had used up a third. Still, it was important he covered the congress as thoroughly as possible. Gatherings like this didn't happen so often, and a journalist of Roberto's stature even rarer got the privilege to attend such a historic event.\n\nThe Americans from the National Progressive Party (what a curious name) seemed to get along with all the other delegates and attendees, Roberto included. He shook hands with a, oh what was the name, Roberto struggled to piece together the words. Ah yes, Michael Harrington, a very nice gentleman. Guiseppe Saragat seemed to think so as well. The two were damn near inseparable, discussing who knows what. Probably their favorite social or economic reform. What a couple of bleeding-hearts.\n\nRoberto had a harder time interacting with the delegates from India and Azad Hind. They seemed more, - Roberto couldn't think of the expression. They were more on edge. Perhaps they were not so easily impressed with the congress. Roberto could see their point. For all its fanfare and triumphant hailings of the beginning of the end for the fascisti, there remained much to be desired. Only time would tell if this congress truly was the beginning of a sincere and lasting union of solidarity. Sheik Mujibur Rahman, in his address to the congress, seemed to summarize Roberto's more pessimistic feelings on the matter. "It's not over yet."\n\nThe Japanese delegates, of all the attendees, were the most optimistic about the gathering. Roberto found their speech, about hope for a freer world and their country to atone for its shameful and brutal past, a truly inspiring moment for the congress. It was, however, topped only by Oliver Tambo's bombastic speech. Roberto was moved by his stories of resistance against the reichskommissariats and the struggle of liberation his people fought for everyday. If a man like Tambo can so vigorously fight on against the fascisti, then maybe this truly was the beginning of the end for them. As the congress ended and Roberto made for the door, he made one final note before stepping out into the brisk darkness."

"When going to vote, the Italian voter will have more choice. The voter can, if they wish, still vote for candidates from one party as before.

His main worry was the number of translators roaming around, chatting with each other in English and exchanging notes. Surely this much whispering, during his speech to inaugurate the Council, would detract from the fiery relevance of his words?\n\nHe need not have worried. The audience, a varied assortment of activists, academics and diplomats, listened attentively with their eyes fixed on him as translators whispered into their ear. Sanzō Nosaka, the Japanese communist whose entry into the room had caused a stir, was nodding vigorously to his colleague's whispers. As he spoke Nenni, picked out other figures he had been informed about by his advisers. From the US Dorothy Day, a Catholic pacifist, and a folk singer called Phil Ochs. From Britain Hugh Brock, a journalist, and from Spain Llorenzo Vidal Vidal, a writer. Many of his countrymen he recognized himself - Ernesto Balducci, a dissident priest, had come up to him and shaken his hand. Whilst the relative lack of politicians of much import stung at first, Nenni would see it later on as a blessing. The people in this room would talk freely, caring for the best ideas and not for national interests, and just perhaps, the seed sown here would be the beginning of a wider legacy. Something rarely felt in Nenni's life surfaced, a sense of humility.

Ever since the Italians had managed to reform into a democracy, she had watched with ever mounting horror as the Italians had somehow managed to pick the socialists of all people to lead their nation.\n\nOf course, she'd understood why. The Italian people were greatly disillusioned with fascism, and therefore swung hard in the opposite direction the second they'd had the chance. In any case, it seemed as if the FD had brought a new tomorrow to Italy. Her job had expanded greatly, as the American government took a much greater interest in Italy. The government had only grown in popularity as its new programs had managed to raise employment levels beyond projections. To most people, Luce's fears would've seemed like paranoid mongering.\n\nHowever, Luce knew better. It was almost too easy in this day and age to make things seem much better than they were. The improved employment was nothing but a sham, an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Italian people. These leftists had a sinister goal in mind that it seemed only Luce could see: the implementation of a communist dictatorship. The communist FD needed the will of the people in order to achieve their goal, and their pathetic lies were how they earned it. For now sadly, all Luce could do is grin and bear it, as an anticommunist coup at this juncture could only lead to the country sliding towards communism.

Like many others, it was the work of the publicly owned Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, an inheritance from the early days of Fascism now in the hands of a socialist government. Maurizio, a leftist himself, remembered following the discussion over the IRI when some more economically liberal members of the PNF raised the issue of privatization. But they had been shut down, and thank God for that. Now Maurizio was to oversee this construction, one of the largest automobile factories in Italy once it was built. He had not been surprised when they chose him, since his experience in the construction industry was well known, but was grateful nonetheless to-be given this, his biggest project so far. He supposed, in a moment of wry reflection, that he was a public official now. Maybe he should have someone stitch an Italian flag into his shirt!\n\nMaurizio dragged an elbow against his damp forehead. It was a hot day. He walked around leisurely, shouting instructions and keeping an eye out for the new builders. They had needed to fetch some people from the outside and there were disagreements with his men at first, but Maurizio tried to stifle arguing as it happened. He was happy with the extra hands, which would speed up the factory's opening, and it was good when something like this created more work. God knew work was not something which could be taken for granted, even in good times for the economy such as this one. So when one of the new builders made a very stupid mistake and cost them some of the construction materials, Maurizio had stood up for him and saved the man his job. Even as they grumbled, he could see the men respected him for it. Now morale was better than ever, and the kid who made the mistake learned quickly. All was well.\n\nA more economically minded man would have pointed to a larger pattern, saying that complex merging policy decisions had made the current building boom, with IRI opening worksites all over the country and creating prosperity wherever it did. Maurizio did not care too much for this bigger picture, but he appreciated that the men in Rome did, and that his guidance would translate a larger vision into something on the ground.

It reminded Matteo of that old American movie his father showed him so long ago. The one with the tin-man and the long windy road. Mateo noticed more of his neighbors out-and-about as well. Never in his life could he recall anyone daring to walk the streets beyond going to work or taking a quick trip to the grocers. And even then, it was best to be quick about it, to avoid any trouble. Such fears seem so misplaced, the way people were carrying on. As Matteo made his way to his front door, he overheard so many lighthearted conversations. People chattering about how much better their pay is now compared to before. How a few months ago everyone was barely meeting their rent, let alone paying off bills like electricity or utilities. Now, it seems that those troubles have passed.

A somewhat stunned Enrico Berlinguer was proclaimed Secretary of the PSI, but quickly recovered and vowed to all in the room that socialism in Italy would prevail.\n\nYoung and charismatic enough to fire up the youth and the workers, yet tactful enough to win over mature members of the Fronte Democratico, Berlinguer's win fired up Rome with elation and disgust in equal measure. In building on the momentum of this victory Nenni's task now was to choose between two approaches, with differing degrees of radicalism.\n\nThe first approach would, whilst radical itself, see us working within the bourgeois system. Focusing our political efforts against the fascists of the Blocchi Nazionali, appealing to workers directly, and using the tools afforded us by the Constitution, we would forge socialism in the Italian way. If even this was too far for Saragat and his social democrats, who had been grumbling darkly since their loss, then Saragat be damned. This approach would keep the party's voting base behind us and strengthen our government, even as conservative elements in the country would do everything to undermine us.\n\nYet there were those who say this would not be enough, and Nenni is inclined to listen. The enemies of socialism in Italy would be against a Nenni-Berlinguer government no matter what, and could step in to destroy the socialist project. We could, then, seize the moment, and wage a revolution won through the ballot. By weakening the King and the armed forces, and rallying the people behind us, we could outwit the enemies of socialism and destroy their power over Italy forever. Only then could our beloved country be free of the fascists once and for all, so we can create a better Italy with no one holding us back!\n\nWith the party's intrigues complete, Nenni called Berlinguer to him to discuss his decision."

The tone of the rally quickly shifted to a more militant one; due to the influx of extremists at the event, spurred on by Berlinguer, who radicalized the crowd. Soon, workers were shouting pro-socialist slogans and demanding further major reforms to be implemented by the government; while still praising and honoring Fronte Democratico for its success so far.\n\nPolice units were called in to break up parts of the rally and to reign in the radicals who were inciting the crowd.

Due to the further liberalization of the government and its laxing of political restrictions, Dante and thousands of his fellow students were exposed to ideals they had never heard of before. Ideals like the works of Karl Marx, Amadeo Bordiga, and Antonio Gramsci. Contemporary figures such as Enrico Berlinguer were, miraculously, able to capture Dante and his compatriot's newfound radicalism and channel it into a more tightly honed expression of discontent. But it seems, despite all the political education and organizing on the part of the students, it was all going out the window. But Dante didn't care. For the triumphant moment of the working class had come. Or at least Dante hoped. Because just as easily things could go south, really fast. Hence, the ever overcrowding lobby full of socialist radicals of all-stripes. What was taking them so damn long? And then as if on cue, the screen flashed and the two men Dante was expecting appeared on screen. Dante held his breath as... his fears were calmed and hopes sent skyrocketing through the roof.\n\nHis confident smirk transformed into a wide-smile as Pietro Nenni heralded a new age for Italy. There was Berlinguer, standing side by side with Nenni, the powerful imagery not escaping Dante. The two most popular socialist figures of Italy, standing exultantly next to each other like old comrades, represented the now fully unified working class who were mobilized against the forces of capital. The disparagement political parties now under the single commanding banner of socialist liberation! With a leap out of his seat, Dante gathered his friends around him.\n\n"Now is the time! It is our duty to aid comrade Berlinguer and the working class in ushering in this new era of Italian Socialism!" Dashing out of the building, followed first by a few, then a whole swarming mass of fellow students, Dante made for the nearby town square. There, right in the center, stood a 7.62 metered flagpole. The flag of the old order flying limply in the air. Dante, with all the vigor he could muster, climbed to the top. As he was climbing, he called out for a plain red banner. With the banner of working people in one hand, he tore off the old Italian flag, and replaced it with the banner of the future. Clinging to the top, Dante could see for miles around other squares and poles, the lowering of the old flag and the raising of the red banner. Yet some, if not more, still flew the old national flag proudly along with the banner of socialism. Truly, the peoples' will was ascendant in his country. And Dante couldn't be more pleased."

 FD.28.t:0 "The Usual Critics" # our revolution
 FD.28.d:0 ""They could not be more predictable if they tried," Nenni laughed, his voice booming around the room. "Have you read this yet, Marco? Go ahead, take a look." The secretary obliged and skimmed the passage, written by one of DC's more regressive members in a Catholic paper.. 'The Fronte Democratico is a danger to many of the virtues, namely order, civility and family values, by which Italians should live according to the teachings of the Church. By asking men to openly challenge authority, and to take things into their own hands, Nenni must be considered not only a servant of dark forces but a provocateur, seeking to create social strife which the communists can then use to establish an atheist society..' So it went, for the rest of the page. Marco smiled uncertainly and looked up, just as Nenni clapped him on the back and continued chuckling to himself. The secretary had work to do, but knew better than to interrupt the boss when he was in one of his talkative moods.\n\n"The best thing about it is it's not just the politicians," Nenni was saying now. "So you know how many reports I get per week of priests denouncing me in the churches as a communist? Guess, Marco, just guess." Marco guessed, but the number was larger. "It's unimaginable that they would want us to fail this badly. This is their country too, you know. When Mussolini was trampling over everything the Church held dear, where were these priests? And I don't even want to talk about the Army. Do you know what I heard this week? And this doesn't leave this room." Marco nodded. "They said I was working for foreign forces, a German provocateur trying to wreak havoc throughout society.All this because we fight for the workers, Marco.\n\nBut you know what I also know? That if they have this much complaining to do, then we are hurting them. If the elite has all these words for our action, then we need more action, and faster. And God help me, if we ever give in to these bastards, then all of our work will be undone, twice over. We can only respond to this provocation with more work! For the downtrodden and poor of Italy, who have waited all this time for our moment in the sun!""
 FD.28.a:0 ""Sir, can I get back to work now?" "Ah yes, Marco. Of course.""
 
 FD.29.t:0 "The Army's Solemn Response to Nenni"
 FD.29.d:0 "Setting out things which had been set on fire was a part of the job, but the police of Milan had not dealt with something like this before. The culprits were a group of soldiers on leave in the city, and the crime, some two hundred socialist newspapers bundled together and set alight outside a bar. The headline was still just barely legible on one of the scraps - something about Nenni's address to the Army. The bar hand who had been working that evening spoke calmly to the Police. No, Signoro, he had not heard anything unusual, he was inside the entire time and there was a lot of noise. He had served some soldiers, but none of them looked drunk.\n\nIn fact, Davide knew very well what had happened. Some of the soldiers were childhood friends of his; he knew the rest as good men. When they were in for a drink, they bemoaned to him a rumour they'd heard. Nenni was to publish a memorandum in the papers tomorrow, 'reminding the Army of their oath to defend the Government, as was their duty'. It was Davide himself who told them where the leftist papers were sold, where the vendor kept the key, and how they should show Nenni what they thought of his accusations.\n\nDavide felt like a general: giving orders to his troops, then standing back to watch the flames. When the rest of his friends went into the forces he had stayed behind, helping his uncle serve wine to drunkards and prostitutes. Sometimes he regretted it, but not today. God forbid he ever had to serve under a communist, and moreover, one who would call him a traitor for all Italy to hear."

While the people are generally happy that elections have successfully occured, not all is well. The Fronte Democratico is absolutely furious, and there have already been countless rallies against our noble party throughout Italy, decrying the "backslide into fascism." The Democrazia Cristiana, on the other hand has remained very, very, quiet on the matter.\n\nOf course, we must remember the victory of the BN was not due to a single party, but rather a coalition. While Almirante himself leads the MSI, the core of the coalition, there are many different factions, including the national conservatives in the MSI led by Arturo Michelini, the monarchist PDIUM, and a various collection of smaller parties to the right of even the more fascist faction of the MSI. We must be sure to balance this coalition so all of these various factions are satisfied, as our rule over Italy would rapidly come to an end otherwise."

However, this left many questions within the minds of the BN. How should we govern? Should we govern as if things never changed, or should we abide by the rules and limitations that democracy has imposed upon us?\n\nWhile many hardliners in the party point out the possibility of properly restoring fascist rule to Italy, the fact remains that it could still be very dangerous, as even many of our supporters do support democracy, even if said democracy is ruled by fascists. The question is one that must be answered now, so that the BN can properly begin governing the Italian Empire."

Naturally, we know the truth, but the people will be resistant to any attempts to reverse the popular democratic reforms.\n\nThat being said, the people do not necessarily need to know our true intentions all the time.

It is obvious that we must hold a party Congress so that the BN itself can reach a consensus on how to lead the government. There are two major options that have been proposed by the various blocs within the party.\n\nThe first option is that we go alone, and attempt to balance out the various factions of the BN. This would help maintain our electibility, but there are fears that party infighting could lead to such a government being ineffective. On the other hand, we could form an unofficial alliance with the DC by moving more in the conservative direction as compared to the fascist direction. While this would lose us popularity from the far right, it would also appeal to more of the Italian population, and likely assist us in governing.

While it is certainly true that he did and does not support the authoritarian style of control associated with Mussolini and Scorza's facism, the idea that he is in any real sense a "liberal" who would associate with either FD or DC is simply laughable. The truth of the matter is that the good Count has far more in common with us than with any of our immediate rivals. Perhaps he may not agree with all of our more... zealous members, but such is the benefit of being a big tent party. Our alliance with several monarchist groups has given us a good standing amongst those with aristocratic backgrounds, among whom the second Duce is a prominent voice. Asking Ciano for a public show of support would therefore stand a significant chance of success and would hold large potential rewards."

After all, the BN is not an anti-democratic organization, nor is it one that seeks to reverse the flow of time. Just like our rivals, we seek to build a better nation following our turn to democracy.

One way which we can work around this is by appealing to the bourgeoisie. In other words, we must appeal to middle class and upper-middle class Italians. This may seem like an odd choice, but it actually makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe middle classes are usually the most economically-minded members of society, and they vote primarily on who'll be best for the economy, and, in turn, their own livelihood. We must appeal to them by presenting ourselves as the party of the Italian economy and its prosperity. Whilst the Communists want to nationalize everything, and the liberals in other parties do nothing for the average Italian, we shall make it clear that a vote for the BN is a vote for economic stability and prosperity!"

Not only is he internally dividing us at a time when we need to be unified, but he is also becoming a useful idiot for our opponents who are using his bombastic rhetoric and positions to assault our image in the public imagination.

 BN.1.t:0 "The Future of Fascism" # Post Ciano Fascism
 BN.1.d:0 "The discussion at the main headquarters of the party started to get more heated. With the electoral victory of the Blocchi Nazionali, the high-ranking members reunited to discuss what should be the next steps. The moderate wing argued that the BN should respect the new democratic institutions to consolidate its own power, while the hardliner wing argued for a return to the glory days of fascism without any kind of compromises. After many accusations of "defeatism" and "lack of vision" on both sides, it became clear that there was no real plan or political agenda to follow the victory at the elections. "The political landscape has changed. I stand for the fascsist principles like anyone in this room, but we need to adapt to this new reality. Pragmatism is a necessary evil for our movement to survive." De Marsanich argued.\n\n"Nonsense. The movement is strong by itself. We need to crush these weak socialists and restore order like we did decades ago." answered Rauti passionately.\n\nLauro eventually joined the feud. "I understand that sometimes compromise is necessary but we can't sell our ideals like this. Democracy is the enemy of fascism not its friend!"\n\nEventually, everyone started to scream at each other without coming to any agreement. Rauti even requested Almirante to expel the moderates from the party for "treason to the fascist cause". Growing increasingly tired after hours of loud noise in that hot small room, Almirante slammed his fist into the table. "Enough of this! We are supposed to be the vanguard of fascism, not a bunch of screaming animals." Silence invaded the room, as Almirante finally made his decision. "I already made up my mind about what is the best course of action for fascism and I hope you'll respect my decision as Prime Minister and head of the party."

Undoubtedly, it was a more relaxing location than the suffocating tiny room from the prior reunion. The atmosphere was more positive now that most of the hardliners decided not to go in protest. Almirante planned for a more informal reunion at the sauna with his colleagues to relax a bit and laugh about the old times. But for a fascist, the duty always comes first. The congress of that day had the objective of reconsidering a coalition with the Democrazia Cristiana, discussing the possibility of a joint legislative agenda. n/n"While our party still remains strong after the last elections, we may need support from the Democrats for our next projects. Besides, the Socialists could represent a threat and everyone in this room can agree that we don't want them to push their libertine agenda. Right, Mr. Andreotti?" De Marsanichi exposed.\n\n"Uh, sure. Our party appreciates that the Blocchi Nazionale was willing to approach us in the first place. If we can compromise on our...small differences, I'm sure that this coalition could work." Andreotti answered. The two gentlemen engaging in a civilized discussion was a breath of fresh air for Almirante compared to the loud madness from a couple of days ago. "However, the final decision is up to our leader. He'll decide if we move forward with this" De Marsanich said looking at Almirante with a smile. Almirante knew that De Marsanich was probably just licking his boots because he favored the moderates, but for once it felt good that his party recognized his rule. Sidelining those reckless extremists was a very good idea in hindsight. The Prime Minister cleared his throat and he prepared for an answer."

"One more speech and I can go home." he thought. His girlfriend was demanding to spend more time together.

Since they ignored his demands, he tore apart his membership card and announced his resignation from his position at the party.The Duce would be so ashamed to see his beloved party capitulate to the whims of the liberals. Walking on the streets, he reflected on how fascism has reached this low point.The answer was obvious: greed and arrogance corrupted the fascist movement and someone needed to purify it from the leeches that want to undermine the cause. "I'll protect the future of fascism no matter the cost and with any means necessary. Even if I have to destroy the country itself." Rauti thought to himself. A malicious grin appeared on his face.

One day, pictures of him on meetings with some of his "friends" started to appear at his doorstep with the inscription "It's not our problem but it could be." The message was pretty clear: even the King couldn't stop the fascist restoration.

Unlike his father, he actually wanted to give democracy a chance and give freedom to the Italians. However, the fascists already had a taste of power and they weren't willing to fold to any democratic institutions. History never changes.

His son gave his life in the desert to keep up the fire of fascism alive in the Middle East. And how his grandchildren thanked his great service to the proud Italian nation? The male one became a lawyer, defending the rights of the deviants and communists that are threatening the fabric of society with their subversive actions. The younger female one became an actress, working at the den of degeneracy that is the cinema industry. And their neglecting mother does nothing but enable their corruption, so it was no surprise to him that they became like that even with the best fascist education. As far as he could tell, the three were dead to him. All these years, he felt like he was truly alone in this world. But there was a time when he was truly happy.\n\nAfter returning from the First War bitter and resentful, he joined the Blackshirts with the hope that he could make a difference in saving his beloved Italy. That fateful day of October, he marched in Rome with his fellow Blackshirts to demand the King to end the weak democratic government and put a true patriot in power. With the appointment of Mussolini as Prime Minister, he felt like he was part of something bigger. It was the happiest day of his life and he loyally served the Duce for the next thirty years. Full of confidence, he was ready to save Italy from the abyss that was in it because of the traitor Ciano. Democracy won't corrupt the minds and souls of the children ever again.

The light noise became more pronounced.\n\nWhile the Blackshirts bound and gagged the two men, the rest surrounded the gates. Almirante made to speak, but suddenly the noise became deafening. A helicopter appeared, bathing the square in artificial light, and dozens of windows opened to reveal the snipers lurking behind. One of the fascists tried to fire, but screamed in pain as he was hit to the shoulder. All others surrendered immediately.\n\nAn officer in high uniform came out of the Quirinale and went to the now-handcuffed Almirante. "Prime Minister, in light of your treason, His Majesty relieves you from your office" he said for everyone to hear. Then, he whispered into his ear: "You are a small man, with an even smaller intellect.

They had been so close: when the fascist supporters had attacked Forte Braschi, one of the fifteen old brick forts protecting Rome, they had merely wanted to storm a lightly guarded armoury. How could they suspect that, under the façade of an obsolete fort, was a maze of heavily protected bunkers housing the HQ of the Servizio Informazione Militare? The fools didn't even have the time to load their guns...\n\nWhen he returned to the command room more than twenty meters under the ground, an aide took him from his reflections: "General! A dispatch from our field operatives!" and gave De Lorenzo a short telegram. "King secured. Activation order given. Government buildings stormed. Parliament secured. Traitors arrested. Some fled. Non-hostile personnel spared. Unnecessary losses avoided. Requesting further orders." The general knew this was the moment he had been preparing for. He went to a secluded archive, one where none had set foot for at least five years if the dust was true: there, he looked for a folder he had personally sealed more than a decade ago, on the orders of the last Duce of Fascism. His hand brushed the rough cardboard files, reading names he would have gladly forgotten, until he found what he wanted: the letters were a bit faded, but still clear in their simple, rough characters. Such a boring name for something so important: "PIANO SOLO", because when De Lorenzo had asked Ciano who should have participated, he had answered "Solo i Carabinieri". He broke the frail seal and took the first, yellowed paper sheet, titled "Azioni indifferibili per la sicurezza dello Stato", and returned to the command room. All noise stopped, everyone looking at him. "All men! Commence execution of Piano Solo!" and noise filled the room once again."

 christdem.35.d:0 "The second ever Italian election after the end of Fascism in Italy have yielded a decisive result: the decidedly centrist coalition of various Christan and liberal parties have secured a majority of Parliament. A formally-dressed King Umberto II could be seen designating the small-statured Amintore Fanfani as Prime Minister, and instructing him to create a new cabinet. The new Prime Minister, who had previously overtaken Aldo Moro as the leading figure of Democrazia Cristiana, has shifted the party somewhat leftwards, promising cooperation and collaboration with the Fronte Democratico on the pushing of their agenda. This significant move has angered many of the more conservative members of the coalition making up the new government, but the dominant position Fanfani holds in the DC has allowed him to maintain this new direction the party has chosen to go down.\n\nIt now lies on Prime Minister Fanfati and his government to guide Italy through the increasingly-tenuous situation in the Middle East, along with the accompanying domestic unrest from the rapidly worsening economic situation Italy finds itself in. Needless to say, the new government faces many problems as it enters Parliament, but that has not swayed Fanfati's promises of success - one characterized by peace, liberty, and democracy."

While many voices of varying levels of influence have criticized the narrative, pointing out its inconsistencies, most of the public, the journalists and the politicians all feel reassured to know that the horror can be easily explained away by pointing at a gang of radical anarchist fanatics - something which Amintore Fanfani is very happy to do, especially during his numerous appearances on national television.\n\nThe reports appearing on the desk of prime minister Fanfani tell a different story. After looking at some particular elements of the case, namely the bags used to carry the explosives and the timers which set them off, police and Carabinieri report point out to the possibility that the terrorist act was, in fact, not orchestrated by the Milanese anarchists. Some photographs, documents and recordings lend credibility to the fact that anarchist cells, dormant in Milan for a long time, have been infiltrated by extremist right wing and neo-fascist groups, with a sort of mesh of personal relationships and political contacts between these anarchist groups and several fascist militants being documented. A hypothesis even emerged that the attack was in fact not carried out by Valpreda, but by another person connected to underground fascist groups carefully disguised to look like Valpreda.\n\nHowever, this is not all. Through Aldo Moro and his extensive contacts in SIM, some top secret documents have reached Fanfani regarding the high possibility of foreign interference in the bombing. Some of the anarchist and fascist militants who were about to be further investigated by local police seem to have vanished into thin air, and some reference to what appear to be codenames for what might very well be foreign operatives pop up in the material that the police amassed. All the officers involved in gathering and analyzing these elements seem to have forbidden themselves from formulating theories regarding where this foreign influence could come from, almost as if they were in fear of the possible implications."

 christdem.52.d:0 "The Prime Minister stepped into the hotel ballroom surrounded by his usual entourage of aides, secretaries, and supporters. The many wings of the party looked back at him, their faces calm but their eyes betraying the uncertain hope they held in him to guide Italy through turbulent times. The political left could offer words of support where they agreed, and plenty of condemnation when they didn't. The political right sent him the nicest letters, when they could be stirred to bother sending them. Such was the price of attempting to chart a center course.\n\nIt had taken nearly five minutes to calm the assembled delegates before he was finally allowed to speak. His prepared speech lay written in cards in his suit pocket, but with the worried glances being shot into him from all sides of the room, it was quite obvious that taking it out would only further fracture the party. With a forced smile and a wiping of his brow, he attempted to speak on how the party could bridge the growing divide both within Italy and indeed within itself.\n\n"Compromise," he began, "Compromise had led to the end of fascism, to the end of political tyranny and uncertainty within Italy. The voters selected me for this office not because of radical ideas and bomb throwing populism, but because all Italians knew that whether they agreed with us or not, the Democrazia Cristiana offered practical, functioning solutions." He wiped his brow again and gave another forced smile. Some delegates even returned it. For the next thirty minutes he continued to offer his hopes for the future of Italy and its democracy, his hopes for party unity and confidence, and his hopes for an end to uncertainty and panic. Perhaps the delegates did not truly believe him, but as long as they could say that they did, it was good enough."

The camera flash echoed across the room, immortalizing the Prime Minister and the politician beside him within the finite medium of film.\n\nOn the left side of the photo stood the Prime Minister, dressed in a fine suit and tie, extending his hand out towards a local member of the Democrazia Cristiana. On the right side of the photo stood that local member, a former farmer and always pious catholic turned local politician for the city of Salerno. Captured in the back of the photo, behind Fanfani and the local politician was the Prime Minister's entourage, a motley assortment of baby faced university graduates turned interns, grizzled party operators, and trusted aides. If one could look close enough, they could see the relief in their eyes at another successful meeting. Few had suspected Fanfani's move to reconcile the Party's left and right would succeed, but all within the party would be glad that it had.\n\nGlancing at the photo, the reporter scowled when he saw that the lighting was off.

The Prime Minister walks into frame from the right, the two members begin clapping as he does so, he waves to the camera. The teleprompter screen is briefly visible in the reflection of his glasses.

To these rioters and criminals within our streets, I can only offer my most sincere condemnation. If you truly wish for change then you can institute it like a normal, civilized member of the population and not as a bomb throwing barbarian.

The Catholic Church and its Pope, Paul VI, for example, had been more than willing to meet with the Prime Minister when asked. It didn't take a genius to figure out why. Fanfani could ask the Pope for stability and peace within these troubled times to shore up his government, and the Pope could use the photo opportunity to stress the unity of being both Italian and Catholic, two ideas that had once seemed almost irreconcilable.\n\nThe meeting itself was, to put it bluntly, almost benign in its content, both men clearly occupied elsewhere. The Pope would ask for guarantees of the government to maintain peace and ensure religious freedom, and the Prime Minister would agree. The Prime Minister would ask the Pope to make sure his flock would remain peaceful and equitable even in the face of violence within the streets, and the Pope would of course agree. At the end of the meeting came the most important part, where the two emerged from Saint Peter's Basilica and embraced.\n\nTomorrow, a photo of that embrace would be on the front page of every newspaper in Italy, and accompanying it would be the newest editorial from the Pope, requesting peace not just for the sake of the government, but for the sake of humanity everywhere."

The Party Right was too apathetic, and the Party Left too divided to ever build the coalition that Italy needed if it was to push forward through such troubled times. With a heavy heart, he had picked up the heavy phone on his desk and placed a call to an unlikely ally. Giuseppe Saragat, leader of the Partito Socialdemocratico Italiano.\n\nAs the two men sat together in the Prime Minister's office, a strange and awkward silence stood between them. In better times it would have been easy for them to talk the night away on topics of policy and politics, but the reality was that Fanfani was the Prime Minister, and the other was only an embattled party leader.\n\nWith some difficulty, the silence was eventually broken, and they began discussing how a middle ground could be formed. Saragat made sure to not let his surprise at the news of Fanfani's decision to move away from his own party show on his face, and Fanfani maintained his composure even during the diciest moment of their negotiations. In the end, a compromise was reached.\n\nThe foundations for Fanfani's most ambitious political gambit were laid."

To say that the Democrazia Cristiana had been critical of the decision would be... an understatement. The press had been vicious, the voters savage, and his own former allies within the party the most critical of all. It didn't take much to imagine how they would react once tomorrow's paper broke the news of his recent meeting with the king.\n\nMeeting with the king under normal circumstances would have, at best, raised one or two eyebrows from the most radical members of the political spectrum. For years his Majesty had conducted himself with an aura of dignity, one that could only be formed through years of dedicated public service. Under normal circumstances, Fanfani would have had nothing to worry about when meeting his majesty.\n\nIt was a shame that these were not normal circumstances.\n\nHis intentions when meeting with his majesty, especially in light of the meeting with Saragat, were obvious. The BN, no matter how their ideas dispersed, could all still reliantly maintain their faith and support for the monarchy. Attempting to pander to them was a dangerous proposition for the Prime Minister, but one that had to be done. He had no idea how his legacy would look, how his supporters would react, and how his own party would fare at the next election. Whatever happened, it did not matter, for with a triumphant shout, he finally finished crunching the numbers. If everything panned out as it should, he would have his majority."

Through the speaker system placed on top of it, excerpts of a recent speech were played one after another, with Fanfani's words mixed in with the words of various prominent union officials. For the assembled factory workers, the campaign truck was either an interesting afternoon diversion or an annoyance distracting them from their food, depending on who you asked.\n\nTwo workers in particular, brothers from a small town outside of Naples, listened intently to the truck, even as it pulled away to drive to another factory. Turning to one another, the oldest spoke first, commenting on how glad he was to see the union bosses and the Prime Minister collaborating. A patriotic military veteran who served with distinction in the Levant, he stood as a polar opposite to his left minded younger brother. His younger brother folded his arms across his chest and listened intently, considering what to say. When at last he finally spoke, it was to the surprise of his older brother.\n\n"Despite what misgivings I have," he began, "I must say it is good to see the Prime Minister refusing to blame the violence on the unions. It would be terrible to have the actions of a few bomb throwing radicals put us all out of a job." As he finished speaking, the factory bell rang signaling the end of their lunch break.

 christdem.59.d:0 "The report on the Prime Minister's desk had been disturbing but expected. Following an intense period of review and investigation by a specially appointed commission, the reported findings had long been suspected but not confirmed. Until now. The Confindustria, an employers association and long a pillar of the Italian economy, was hopelessly inefficient as currently run.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, no obvious easy solution presented itself for remedying this issue. Within the report, the commission had offered two possible solutions, each one equally flawed in its own right. The first solution, written by the commission's more left leaning members and idealists, proposed to simply place greater government controls and regulations on the body, in order to ensure greater efficiency. Without a doubt the leaders of the Confindustria would fight such regulations as hard as they could, and it was questionable whether allowing the same corrupt bureaucrats to continue to run the organization would fix anything at all. The other option, written by pragmatists and the commission's old guard, proposed a simple fix. The Confindustria had been fine up until the democratization, they argued, all it would need to get back on its feet was the return of its old runners who knew the ins and outs of the economy. The only problem: that same old guard had been removed for being fascists without remorse. It is certainly doubtful that the population would simply accept such individuals regaining their old power.\n\nAs appalling as the options presented are, a choice must be made. We can only hope that we make the correct one."

A man dressed in a formerly fine suit, one now caked with dust, debris, and other bits of clutter stumbled into the Church. The clergy looked on with grave concern as he entered, unsure if the man should be in the church or in the hospital. To those present's imminent surprise, the man did not move to pray. Instead, he took the hat off his head and placed it in the center of the Church's foyer, and next to it he placed a simple picture of one of the victims. Out of respect, the clergy placed several candles to mark the spot and assumed nothing more would come of it.\n\nOver the next couple months they would be proven dead wrong.\n\nAt first they came as a trickle. Survivors, family, friends, and anyone else involved. With each visit, the shrine slowly grew. Soon it turned to a flood, as many who had no connection to the tragedy other than a shared sense of hopelessness came and added to the shrine. It grew steadily, soon attracting the intention of not only the press, but even the prime minister himself. In a photograph shown across the world, Prime Minister Fanfani visited the shrine, personally lowering his head in solidarity with those lost.\n\nWhile the shrine eventually was taken down and cleaned up, and for some, even forgotten, the clergy present would never forget it. Decades after the bombing and its aftermath, not a single member of the clergy had even once thought about throwing away the photo taken of them with the Prime Minister."

There has been much uncertainty and fear recently over the growing terrorist attacks and violence within our nation's streets.

Next an Italian family is shown enjoying a midday meal outside, the children smile and play as the parents look at eachother free of worry. Finally, several successive scenes are shown of various investigators and detectives working, each one carefully and analytically completing their investigation.\n\nThe scene changes back to the Prime Minister who is now smiling at the camera. "As you can see, the government has everything under control. I can promise that we have already begun to get to the bottom of this and it will not be long before we return to normalcy."

Isn't he a friend of the last Duce, Galeazzo Ciano? Surely such a man's hands can not be completely clean in this whole ordeal, I wish Fanfani would stop associating with him." Saragat thought to himself.\n\n"This entire gesture is ridiculous, we're campaigning for unity when we should be crushing those protesting reds in our streets. If only I had won the last election... I'm sure Saragat must be thinking the same thing." Thought Lauro to himself.\n\n"At least they were both willing to do this. I can only hope the political blowback from the rest of the party won't be too severe... oh, the press wants a photo."

Rather, they continued to demand the right that if they were to work on it with him, it would have to be on their terms.\n\nAs the Prime Minister sat at his desk after another day of fruitless negotiations, his gaze fell on the calendar on his desk. He had known the date when he had woken up that morning. He had known the date when he had gotten lunch with his aides before the next round of negotiations with the Banks. Only now, at the midnight hour, did he truly recognize the significance of the date.\n\nHis term, one which had opened with promises of stability and prosperity and had stuck through thick and thin, was slowly nearing a close. The fight with the banks was clearly not going anywhere fast, not with the next round of lawsuits and ad campaigns they had threatened to kick up. And all the while he was losing what hair he had left dealing with this, many more important issues lay on the back burner.

Expanding on such programs is not only a good way to build Italy's future today, but it is also a good way to boost Fanfani's stagnate approval numbers.\n\nWith every bill passed increasing funding for these widely popular programs, Fanfani has ensured that he will be the face of it. At the opening of new school's he will cut the ribbon, at the graduation of new university students he will clap in attendance, and at military parades for new cadets he will be there to salute the soldiers.

In the back, reporters gathered to snap a photo of the moment of the Prime Minister cutting the oversized ribbon and bow placed before him, a symbolic ceremony to celebrate the opening of the campus's newest building.\n\nFar in the corner of the assembled students, under the cover of an old tree, two of the school's more left leaning students sat observing the spectacle. They joked together and mocked the speech being given, each one equal parts amused and agitated by the professor's dry speech on the evil's of an ideology he clearly knew little about. For them, it was all in all a pleasant enough way to spend half an hour.\n\nEventually the professor stepped down from his podium and the band present struck up the national anthem.

With more radical socialist and communist parties reduced to mere coalition partners or expelled from the leftist bloc entirely, and Pietro Nenni, the previous leader of the coalition, seemingly beginning to recede from the once crowning public position, the leftist coalition seems to be more united than ever.\n\nThe question now lies on the newly-formed government to manage the increasingly-deteriorating situation in the Middle East, as well as the ensuing domestic unrest, and to guide Italy once more towards the path of their agenda. In a move that surprised little, the Blocchi Nazioonali and it's related partners have pledged fierce opposition to the FD and all related activity. However, in a much more significant statement, the Democrazia Cristiana - likely because the more-moderate wing of the Fronte Democratico has taken control - has announced that they will be collaborating together to pursue an agenda that accommodates both of the coalition's agendas."

 saragat.2.d:0 "...begins with but a single step.\n\nThat proverb was at the forefront of the mind of newly-elected Prime Minister, Giuseppe Saragat, as he walked into his new office. As if it were a mantra, meant to keep Saragat sane in the face of a monumental task ahead.\n\nTo say that Italy was going through a rough time at the moment would be the understatement of the year. Ever since the Hot Autumn strikes a year earlier, Italy had been embroiled in the worst turmoil it had seen since the end of the war. Violence and terrorism were the order of the day, from both leftist and rightist agitators across the country.\n\nRestoring order to a deeply divided nation seemed like an Herculean, if not insurmountable task.\n\nBut whilst Saragat seemed like a meek, soft-spoken man, there was a hidden resolve beneath his spectacles. Now was his time. Time to not only restore order and heal the rifts of a deeply divided nation, but also to, as a result, create a fairer, more just Italy. An Italy for every Italian.\n\nBut first, the hard work..."

 saragat.3.d:0 "Amidst an ocean of violence and terrorism in the conflict-racked Italy, there was one terrorist incident that stood out amongst the rest: the Piazza Fontana bombing. Claiming 17 lives and wounding many more, it was perhaps the deadliest incident yet in the troubled country.\n\nAnd yet, the perpetrators are still unknown, and thus, still at large.\n\nNot helping matters was the fact that many in the Servizio Informazioni Militare (SIM) are believed to be full of agents opposed to the FD's socialist agenda.\n\nThus, a reshuffle was in order. The government could not get to the bottom of the atrocity without the SIM's cooperation, after all.\n\nMany from both politicians and the general public criticized the government's decision to reshuffle the SIM. Some said the government was trying to stack the deck in their favor. Right-wingers and the BN in particular claimed that the government was 'politicising the SIM', and that it would abuse it in order to persecute them and their supporters.\n\nIt certainly was not a good look for the government, with newspapers and broadcasts across the country condemning it. But ultimately, getting to the bottom of the Piazza Fontana bombing, and bringing its perpetrators to justice, was more important than optics."

 saragat.4.d:0 "Strength in Unity...\n\nIt was an old adage, but one that has held true throughout the history of humanity. Perhaps it was for this reason that Saragat opted to make overtures to the Fronte Democratico's direct competitor, the centrist Democrazia Cristiana\n\n"I do not agree with the FD on everything. However, we agree on the biggest issue facing Italy today: this violence and terror has got to end! The FD has our support in stabilizing our country!"\n\nIt would be too much to expect the DC of Armintore Fanfani to join the FD-led government in a grand coalition. But it was clear that Saragat's olive branch to DC was not without fruit. Both in public and in private, Armintore Fanfani made it clear that the FD and DC had broadly similar goals for the situation: to stabilize Italy and safeguard Italy's fledgling democracy from those who would do it harm.\n\nWhilst many of the more radical elements of the FD grumbled at the fact that Saragat was open to working with DC, at the end of the day, it was necessary to put country over party. For the sake of Italy, and its still-young democracy."

Good to see you!"\n\nFanfani had a reputation as a man with a very loud, forceful personality, and a true firebrand for DC's progressive wing. In other words, a far cry from the mild-mannered, down to earth Saragat. One would think that the two would have clashing personalities, and that they would be like oil and water.\n\nAnd yet, that was not the case.\n\nFanfani, whilst a firebrand, was also a great compromiser, just like Saragat. It stood to reason, after all, considering DC was a big-tent party with many factions. But meeting with him one-on-one, Saragat soon realized that the two men actually had quite a bit in common despite their differing personalities.\n\nThe meeting of the two men lasted quite some time. But by the time both left the room, both had smiles on their faces. Perhaps it was because they were able to get a lot of business done, or perhaps the two men just enjoyed each other's company. Regardless, Saragat left the meeting with a positive outlook on the budding cooperation between them."

 saragat.6.d:0 "The communists had long been a troublesome element of the Fronte Democratico coalition. Many moderates were already skeptical of socialism; needless to say, they balked at the radicalism of the Italian Communist Party. However, they formed an essential part of the FD coalition, so Saragat would have no choice but to meet with the leader of the PCI: Enrico Berlinguer.\n\nBerlinguer was certainly an interesting character. In some ways, he was a modest man quite similar to Saragat himself. That said, the man certainly was not wanting for charisma. He was a heartthrob for leftists across Italy, even those who weren't necessarily fans of the communists he was associated with. Perhaps it was because he gave off the aura of an honest, genuine man, who wanted to make life better for Italians. None could ever doubt the sincerity of his intentions on that front.\n\nWhilst Saragat would never be able to claim Berlinguer was a bad person with a straight face, he nevertheless needed him on board during these trying times. The problem was that Berlinguer is a very outspoken man, and he has had some biting criticism of Saragat's government, and its 'inaction' on the issues ravaging Italy.\n\nNevertheless, he was an integral part of the FD coalition. Saragat's brow furrowed, as he would have to bring him around, if only to get him to stop criticising the government."

Now, more than ever since the end of the war, Italy needed leadership. A strong leader, who would carefully steer the ship through these stormy, uncharted waters.\n\nWas Giuseppe Saragat such a leader?\n\nToday, it would be put to the test, as Saragat opened his mouth to speak to the Italian people.\n\nThe contents of the speech did not matter. It was largely the same platitudes about unity in these trying times, and how it was important for every Italian to look out for one another. What mattered was that it was received well, and that the crowds cheered. That was it. To show that support for the government was still there, even as Italy was in flames.\n\nAs Saragat's speech wound down, before closing it out with a fervour that one would be surprised to see from the mild-mannered gentleman, there was silence... at first.\n\nAnd then the clapping started.\n\nThe crowds were cheering. Saragat had achieved what he set out to do."

 saragat.8.d:0 "The FD was a coalition of various parties on the left. Ranging from social democrats all the way to the hardcore communists. As has been the case with leftist coalitions throughout history, division was often rife despite their nominally similar ideologies, to the point that sometimes their coalition seemed more fiction than fact.\n\nIf Italy were to have any confidence in the government to be strong and stable, it would need to have confidence in the party running said government to do the same.\n\nTo that end, a meeting was organized between the socialists and the communists in the FD in order to showcase unity within the FD and the wider left. Attended by notables from all the parties of the FD, the rally made it clear that, whatever divisions there may seem to be, FD was a united front. At least, on the issues that mattered.\n\nThe rally was a roaring success! It was widely reported throughout the Italian media. Some may say that it was just for optics, but the average reception amongst Italians was positive. And ultimately, that meant it was a win for the FD."

 saragat.9.d:0 "The time had come.\n\nFD had, until now, been a coalition of the myriad of parties that made up the Italian left. Most notably the Italian Socialist Party and Italian Communist Party, amongst a variety of other parties ranging from social democrats to hard-left marxists. Whilst they contest elections as a united front, they were still, at the end of the day, separate parties working to a common goal.\n\nNo longer.\n\nThe Fronte Democratico has been reborn. As one party, and only one party. The PSI and the PCI, along with their many allies, no longer exist; its members, and elected officials, are now simply members of the Fronte Democratico. No ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nSome people from across the FD's various factions were not happy with this development. But the leaders of the FD argued its necessity. Both for making it easier to contest elections, as well as showing to the Italian people that the era of the fractious left was over. Italy needed unity now more than ever. And the FD was willing to make the first move towards it, for a stronger party, and a stronger Italy."

 saragat.10.t:0 "The Media Circus" # As the FD is slandered in the media, the party stands as strong as ever
 saragat.10.d:0 "It was no secret that the FD had a sometimes strained relationship with the Italian media.\n\nWhilst a free press was obviously essential for any functioning democracy, it also meant that the press had free reign to, rightly or wrongly, drag the government's image through the mud. And drag through the mud the media did. It seemed like the FD could do nothing at all without being raked over the coals by the media.\n\nBut that did not perturb Saragat and the FD. They would not let broadcasters with chips on their shoulders dissuade them from doing what was right. For the party, and for the country. Even though the media seemed to be hellbent on slandering the government and tearing it down, there was no choice but to press on, no matter the cost.\n\nFailure was simply not an option."

No party could hope to remain in government without at least paying lip service to 'family values'.\n\nOf course, 'family values' means different things to different people. To some, it's associated with fundamentalism and traditionalism.\n\nNot so for Saragat and the FD. Of course, they obviously supported 'family values'. But to them, it meant more "taking care of the family" than about traditionalism or morality.\n\n"Excellent healthcare for every Italian! Generous pensions for elderly Italians in their golden years! A thorough education for young Italians so that they may become productive members of society!"\n\nThese points underscored the FD's messaging on 'family values'. Every Italian family deserved a fair shot at life. From birth until their twilight years, no Italian family deserved anything less than the best."

 saragat.12.d:0 "The relationship between Saragat and PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer was not always good. But that, perhaps, was due to change.\n\nWith the merger of the FD into a single party, it was more important than ever to show that its leaders were a united front, to both FD members and the Italian public at large. It was for this reason that Berlinguer and Saragat increasingly began to voice their support for each other and increased their cooperation. After all, no progress could be made for Italy when the government could not agree with itself.\n\nSome of the moderates in the party were wary of working with a noted communist like Berlignuer, but they ultimately kept those doubts to themselves. The leftists in the party, of course, were nothing less than thrilled at this turn of events."

The conservative coalition, including members from both monarchist, post-fascist, and more moderate right-wing parties, has undergone a series of transformations since the first election since the revival of democracy in Italy.\n\nIn a telling display of the conclusion of the death of Fascism, the moderate bloc of the BN has ultimately began to take a commanding lead over the coalition, and the radical extremes of monarchism and those advocating a return to the Fascism of old have slowly been phased out of the mainstream.\n\nAs a stern-faced King Umberto II appoints Achille Lauro - the leader of the moderate wing of the BN - as Prime Minister, they are now faced with a challenging task: managing the rapidly worsening situation in the Middle East as well as on the homefront, while also preserving the democracy some in the coalition seem so eager to once again destroy."

 marsanich.2.t:0 "The New Strategy"
 marsanich.2.d:0 "A bloody disgrace, a horrible shame, an inhuman tragedy - these and other such expressions did Achille Lauro, new Italian prime minister, use to refer to the recent Piazza Fontana attack. And yet, when asked what the government was planning to do regarding the attack, prime minister Lauro's responds with words that are much more vague. Following the official police reports, the prime minister was happy to point at gangs of fanatics from extremist, most likely anarchist and perhaps communist, cells from Milan and the hinterland - and apart from invoking greater executive prerogatives and giving emergency powers to the police to deal with the matter as they see fit, Lauro hasn't exactly done much to address the bombing, at least publically.\n\nIn truth, Lauro does have a very clear plan in mind. To Lauro, the questions of who placed the bomb in Piazza Fontana and why simply don't matter. Was it anarchists, fascists, communists, foreign spies, Italian agents? Nobody knows, and nobody will probably ever be able to know. Whoever did it was most likely smart and powerful enough to hide his traces and cover up everything long before whoever's in charge of investigations will manage to get even close to the truth. What truly matters is how the bombing can be used. The people of Italy live in fear - a bomb, a bullet, a knife might reach anybody, anywhere - a crazed radical with bloodshot eyes and a red or black scarf might jump out of the shadows at a moment's notice - no train, tram or building is safe.\n\nIn such a climate, what the people need it to feel reassured. They need to hear the calm, strong hand of the state on their shoulders. Restrictive and authoritarian laws are welcomed by the majority, and the minority that protests is decried as an unwilling, or perhaps even willing, ally of the terrorists. In such a climate, governing a nation is easy - you simply need to tell them what they want to hear. Lauro realized this very well, and as the orders to give extraordinary powers to local police commissars are already being sent out, he knows that this is only the first step. Using tension as a weapon, Lauro and his allies plan to shape Italy into the mold they designed - a strong, moral and noble Italy, its children devoted to the King and to the Fatherland, and governed by the steady and firm hand of Achille Lauro."

It must be stated these people are but extremely patriotic friends of the state, nothing more.\n\nThrough a wide array of phone calls, letters, and backroom deals the press started printing just what Lauro wanted.

Amintore Fanfani and Arnaldo Fortani, the kingpins of the Democrazia Christiana. The three of them were some of the most powerful men in Italy, and they were going out for brunch. Eventually, they parked outside of some quaint cafe amid one of the busiest areas of the city. As they sat down to eat, they realized they hadn't actually any idea what to talk about. So, they turned to the absolute centrepiece of any conversation, sports! It turned out that Amintore was a fan of soccer too, and watched the same teams Lauro did.\n\nOver the course of the meal, the tensions surrounding them melted away, and they were well into conversation after the eating was done. Political discourse, small talk and of course the odd joke about their own parties made the hour. It seemed that Amintore was a nice guy, and Arnaldo was interesting, as quiet as he was.

Many in the BN have taken it upon themselves to criticize those that have not called out the perpetrators, especially socialist groups. Despite the fact no clear evidence even proving the bombers are socialists, this has made a convenient route to demonize socialist groups that could serve as threats to the BN's rule.\n\nThe FD itself is included within this ring of parties, but no outright statements have been made against it, for fear of the press picking up on it and spreading the BN's blatant usage of the situation to further their own agenda.

Those original followers of Almirante and even Scorza have been taken aback to these actions and now some even leave the party. Public demonstrations, letters of resignation and complaints all show clearly the frustration present in the party. Despite all their crying and shouting, Lauro likely couldn't care less. In his mind, the more his section dominates, the better. He is even now purposely pushing these members to leave, and outright removing others. Regardless of how detrimental to short-term stability it may be, it will run out smooth, just like the plan says."

His past. Or, at least, that was the story he wanted to present. Why people didn't like him wasn't a concern, only how he can change their minds. After some excruciatingly long strides, he reached the podium. Looking out across the sea of reporters, a barrage of lights assaulted his eyes. The press was always eager to take pictures. He looked away quickly, lest he go blind. Shuffling his neat collection of papers, he laid them out across the thick mahogany stand. The bleaching white lights that operated above him illuminated only his position in the large dark room. Unlucky, he thought, because he must've appeared quite nervous. Adjusting his collar and clearing his throat, he began.\n\n"...and that, the fair people of Italy, is why you must trust me! For the good of this nation and for the good of its citizens, I am the one who will lead you. My associates, and my own past, must be put aside. I am another son of Italy, as all of you are, and I share your struggles. That is why I must appeal to you for your trust so that our great nation may prosper."\n\nWith those closing remarks, his speech was done. Almost immediately, a wave of questions knocked aside the quietness of the room, asking him to respond to this accusation or that one, some scandal he must solve. He didn't have time for it.

This time he would be meeting His Majesty Umberto II, King of Italy. Lauro, like any good Italian politician, is at his heart a monarchist. What else is Italy if not a monarchy? But, he also understands the power the king wields in government, and now must make a good impression. Pulling up in the limousine to the Quirinal Palace, Lauro just had to take a moment to admire its grand architecture. Its magnificent spire sat outside, triumphantly soaring into the sky. It was evident much meticulous effort was put into the construction of such a building. But now was not the time to gaze at carved stone, now, Lauro had to conduct politics. Entering through its grand doors, he was ushered into a finely decorated room without much reception. After some 20 minutes passed, the door opened.\n\nIn stepped the king, followed in close stride by a servant. Lauro hastily stood and bowed. The king, in truth, cared not for such pleasantries and wanted to get down to business, much the same as Lauro. The servant was waved out of the room on a mission to bring the two men tea. The king casually sat down on the couch across from Lauro, forgoing much of any greeting but a cold handshake. Lauro didn't entirely know what to do, but took a seat regardless. There was a still tension in the room for the longest time as the two men eyed each other. Eventually, Lauro broke the ice by talking about the building itself, the furniture of the room, whatever else to get things going. By the time the servant had brought the tea, the two started to indulge in small talk. And, of course, they eventually reached politics. In Umberto's mind, Lauro associates are perhaps an antithesis to the democracy he has helped construct, but he is tolerable. And so, the conversation went on, and so did the cups of tea. The talking only truly ended when the kettle was empty."

 marsanich.9.t:0 "A Most Holy Meeting"
 marsanich.9.d:0 "Lauro was really starting to get sick of all these meetings. How many people did he have to talk with, eat with, shake hands with just to get what he wanted? A lot, apparently. And so it went on. Every week, he picked out the nicest suit he had, rode around in the limousine the government gave him, and met somebody of varying importance within the Italian hierarchy. And when it was done, he still had an entire day of work left! Madness, he thought, madness. If this is how frustratingly difficult being prime minister was, he would've never done it. At least today, he got to meet someone a little interesting.\n\nRiding into the Vatican is, technically, entering another nation. But, at the same time it is like crossing the street. Entering through the old and glorious marble structures, he finally received a warm reception. Bishops, cardinals, priests, all the like, greeted him. However, much like many of his other meetings, he was brought into a room and told to wait. The room he entered was not very quiet, however, cameras and their crews stood off to the wall and awaited the entrance of the man of the hour, the Pope. If the Pope liked the prime minister, it would be a comfort to much of Italy, being a catholic nation after all. And so, he entered, followed by a possy of different men in robes and suits. They both put on a good show for the cameras, discussing topics Lauro was told to talk about exclusively. And, at the end of it, perhaps the Pope really did like him, and with it the blessing of God."

 marsanich.10.t:0 "A Beatiful Day For Protesting"
 marsanich.10.d:0 "It was a warm, sunny day. Birds were chirping, flowers bloomed, and the sky cleared away entirely. The perfect day for political protests, surely! In Rome, the BN had decided to organize a rally for its members in wake of new tensions throughout the city, being the hotbed of politics within Italy. At the rally, there was more than just the average political guy who joined for something to do. Columns of BN "affiliates" lined the square, the very same affiliates which have been stirring up such a fuss for the past few weeks. Mostly what the average Italian citizen would consider an extremist, the groups caused a racket just getting to the parade square. For Lauro, managing these people was a nightmare, and standing on the stage above them he felt powerless. It is why he must get rid of them, eventually.\n\nA few blocks away, more activity was going on. Differing political groups had taken to the streets in an attempt to decry Lauro and his associates, regardless of their actual relationship. Polizia were dispatched to set up road barricades and control the protests' ever growing intensity. But it was for naught, and all they could do was sit by the side as the mob marched around, destroying cars, getting into fights, everything that makes a good protest. Lauro could hear their shouts, even from so far away, and worried about this rally of his. The current circumstances would have to do, so he thought. He had persisted through worse, and this will be no different."
 marsanich.10.a:0 "Why can't they just get along?"
 
 marsanich.11.t:0 "Needles To Our Backs"
 marsanich.11.d:0 "Lauro hated to admit it, as did many others in government, but the truth was clear. Every day, police officers were pushed to the brink with constant calls about an attack somewhere or the other. Lauro's desk was being tested by the countless reports of political terrorism and underground movements. Many feared to leave their homes, what if they became the next target of some violent paramilitary? It was clear the situation was only getting worse, and that the fires were only being stoked by some unscrupulous groups.\n\nThe reality was that Italian politics had changed, and changed very quickly it had. Now in part dominated by illegalized movements and paramilitaries, the wars of politics are no longer just fought in parliaments with words and paper, but also in the streets with knives and guns. It was something many refused to believe for a long time, but now every decision made must have its repercussions considered even more."
 marsanich.11.a:0 "Politics is but war with less blood."

 marsanich.12.t:0 "A National Tragedy"
 marsanich.12.d:0 "Lauro walked to the memorial not in his typical confident, long strides, but in a solemn and hunched over shuffle. Laying a wreath of flowers at its base, it would serve as his commemoration to Piazza Fontana. Making sure to have a camera following him, there was an effort to publicize the event and make him more sympathetic in everybody's eye. But, deep down, Lauro truly did mourn the event. The atmosphere of years past had now clearly faded, replaced with one of violence and bloodshed in the name of political gain, and Piazza Fontana was the hallmark of it. When once you could walk the streets at night without fear, families now cower in their homes before it is even dark. Where you could interact with practically anyone without dread of their intentions, now many avoid even locking eye contact with others.\n\nYes, on that day, a piece of Italy died with the many in the explosion. It is now up to Lauro to try and restore that, or at least try. The deaths of those on that terrible day would not go forgotten under his watch, not for a long time."
 marsanich.12.a:0 "Terrorism is a scourge that haunts us all."
 
 marsanich.13.t:0 "All It Takes Is A Little Push"
 marsanich.13.d:0 "Every morning, the newspapers had their headlines plastered with the brand new scandal of the day, almost every time involving Achille Lauro as its main proponent. Everyday, somebody claimed to have finally exposed him for the extremist he is, or that he has been working with some group the equivalent of the Nazis and wishes to bring down hell on Italy. But today, it was different. The morning's timid quietness was suddenly broken by the cry of a paper boy.\n\n"Read all about it! Prime minister orders riot put down! Several injured in fight with police!" And so repeated these words many times, in many parts of the city, and eventually many parts of the nation. The day previously, one exceptionally large protest was getting too close to parliament for comfort. In a manner of minutes, riot boots were on the ground and tear gas canisters were being shot. Panic and chaos ensued, as it usually did, and rioters engaged the police in a brutal battle. Screams and shouts, punches and batons were thrown out across the street. By the end of the short lived carnage, the riot had dispersed and those unlucky ones were left on the street with several broken bones. And as Lauro slowly read the lines of the paper, he felt a mixed bag of emotions. The riot was suppressed, and the battle was over with him having won. But, any action always has its aftershocks. Anarchy is a springtrap always loaded, one wrong turn could be the one that opens it."
 marsanich.13.a:0 "Let us hope all goes well."
 
 marsanich.14.t:0 "The Champion Of Democracy"
 marsanich.14.d:0 "Chaos was beginning to reach its hand over Italy, and it only showed more by the day. Lauro, of course, was at the center of all this, so he has to be the one to fix it. How he wished to simply run away to some Mediterranean island and never even speak the word politics again. But he knew that nothing would be happening until the plan is finished, one way or another. And so it went on. Today, he must make another plea to the people for their trust. Despite all his actions, or misactions, many still see him as an extremist, one that wishes to tear down everything Italy now is and spit on Ciano's work.\n\nOf course though, this couldn't be farther from the truth. But the reality of politics was that the truth isn't always what is believed, and Lauro knew this all too well. And so, as it was, he would host yet another press conference. The words he said were not as important as the message they conveyed, and sometimes getting the message through to the press is a nigh-on impossible task. He told them of his undying support of democracy and the values he and his predecessors have held up, of how much he loves the ballot box and not the will of dictators. Perhaps people did listen, but then again, they could very well have just not bothered. Maybe someone would read the speech on page 2, but others would be too busy flipping to the other channel or doing the crossword. He would get his message out, somehow."
 marsanich.14.a:0 "What happens if the messenger doesn't listen?"
 
 marsanich.15.t:0 "What Makes the World Go Round"
 marsanich.15.d:0 "Past all the politics, the extremism and the terrorist attacks, past everything that has made Italy rotten from the inside, there has always been one thing at its center. Money. You can't exactly fund a rally without the stuff, and you can't run a campaign if your bank account is negligible. So, if Lauro needed some extra cash, where could he find it? With the corporate fat cats, of course. And so a back alley meeting was organized, men from the government and guys from corporate.\n\nWalking into the old car park, Lauro felt as though he was about to be mugged. A sickly dampness wafted around the deteriorating concrete, and it was as though it could fall in on them at any given moment. At the center of the floor, a black van was parked, with three men in suits leaning against its side. To Lauro, this all seemed rather illegal, but whatever paid the bills. Meeting with the businessmen was an entirely different venture. The men themselves were the definition of sleazy, and their business reflected it. Fat cigars rolled around in their mouths, and they wore greasy suits with even greasier hair. The word crime just oozed from these guys, but they were cooperative. After some tense words were exchanged, they reached a mutual deal where Lauro would get his money and big corporate would get their power. Regardless of how these people were, Lauro could and had to look past it, for any of his plans to work."
 marsanich.15.a:0 "It doesn't grow on trees, after all."
 
 marsanich.16.t:0 "The Italian Idol"
 marsanich.16.d:0 "Lauro and his people were on a grand tour. But no music was being played, just the emotions of the people. He had been to ribbon cutting ceremonies, poverty shelters, local celebrations, festivals, parties, fancy dinners, scummy dinners, royal balls, military parades, regular parades, army encampments in Tyrol, naval stations in Sicily, and every goddamn Genoan farmers' wedding. All of these events, he was closely followed by a camera. The point of all this after all, was to make him be seen as strong, relatable and valiant to the Italian people in these trying times.\n\nWhether people actually bought it was an entirely different story. News reels and pictures of the prime minister's visit to a summer festival in Tuscany could be skipped in favour of yesterday's game. But, regardless, Lauro followed the close advice of his public opinion board; who could possibly just be feeding him bullshit while they collect a hefty pay cheque. Inevitably however, information will trickle out to people and make them think this way or that. Lauro would get his message read, come hell or high water."
 marsanich.16.a:0 "They will listen."
 
 marsanich.17.t:0 "It Pays To Have Friends"
 marsanich.17.d:0 "Lauro was pacing around his office, as he usually did at this hour. In a few minutes, two extremely wealthy businessmen would be entering, and he had to make them work with the government. Typically, businessmen don't like to have to run things by other groups before they do their business, but Lauro is confident he can sign them over with some sweet, black gold. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The two men entered, both exquisitely dressed, and both controlling shares in some of the most important sectors of the Italian economy.\n\"I'm glad you made it! Come, have a seat, take off your coat."\n\nThe businessmen were evidently in a relaxed mood, taking their good time in sitting down. Lauro was quite the contrary, finding difficulty achieving even a modicum of comfort in his chair, fidgeting with his thumbs as he formed the words in his mind.\n\n"I'm sure you know the government appreciates your time here today, as do I. I was hoping we could try to come to some sort of ag-" Lauro was cut short by the man sitting to his right.\n\n"Yes yes, to make a deal. Do you think we come into these things without previous knowledge of what we're doing, Mr. Lauro?" The man was clearly quite rude, but Lauro needed his cooperation.\n\n"Err.. Yes, well, I will be giving you the land rights to a few profitable Algerian oil fields for your support in a number of contracts." Almost immediately after he said this, the man to his left spoke up.\n\n"Of course, we'll be happy to. Where do we sign?""
 marsanich.17.a:0 "It was really that easy?"
 
 marsanich.18.t:0 "A House Of Cards"
 marsanich.18.d:0 "To say the situation Italy faces is god awful is perhaps one of the greatest understatements one could make. Everyday, more riots and protests heat up. And every night, more terrorist activity occurs. Stabbings, shootings, robberies, beatings, brawls, all with political motive. And it seems that nothing Lauro does fixes it. His people hate him more by the day, and even his own government seems to have lost their trust in him. And everytime he reads an article about some kid gunned down on a street corner, or the police engaging with rioters, he loses a bit of trust in himself.\n\nIn the Italy of today, it is built as a house of cards. One little breeze, a protest suppression gone wrong, or a scandal sent out of control, is all it takes to knock it over. Lauro knows this, and the situation is pressed into his mind every time he has to meet with his advisors, or the police chief, or god knows who else. All of them will give him bad news. But despite this, he also knows he must persist, for the good of all of his nation. The cards cannot tumble, lest anarchy gain a stranglehold on Italy."
 marsanich.18.a:0 "The worst of times test the best of men."
 
 marsanich.19.t:0 "The Power of the Baton"
 marsanich.19.d:0 "All of these protests were really getting on Lauro's nerves. How ignorant could they be to not see what was in front of them? The government was not the cause of their suffering, but the answer. Lauro realized that people like this would never listen to words, no matter how many documents you shove in their faces, no matter how many speeches you make asking them to stop. No, you have to make them stop. And so it was, on a bright, sunday afternoon, that the call went out across the nation.\n\nPolice vans rumbled to life in every major city in Italy. Roadblocks, barricades and boots on the ground were placed in every intersection. Protests were contained and shut down. Almost in the blink of an eye, the riot police were marching triumphantly against a crumbling tide of protesters. The brute force of the Zhdanov cocktail and fist could not best kevlar gear and sturdy batons.\n\nBy morning, a strange sense of momentary calm had washed over the nation. Inevitably though, the press started printing. Lauro did not care, however. Those who threaten Italy would learn just what the answer to their actions was: a fist to the head and a jab in the gut."
 marsanich.19.a:0 "You really can fight fire with fire."
 
 marsanich.20.t:0 "The Benevolence of Martiality"
 marsanich.20.d:0 "It was only a matter of weeks since what would become known as the Riots Reckoning had passed, but already calm had returned to the streets. Headlines were no longer repeating the words 'riot' and 'protest', and people could go out to the market without fear of being trampled by a mob of college students with signs. What was once a wave of anarchy that swept over Italy now disperses as protesters either go home or get locked up. Lauro's desk could now finally get a rest, no longer topped off by report after report of the hourly March on Rome. Lauro himself could now for once sit back and relax in his office, without being barged in on by a frantic intern with seven new letters from the chief of police.\n\nPublic reactions to the sudden change of atmosphere have certainly been varied. Some respect Lauro finally putting his foot down and teaching those no-good kids a thing or to. Others, not so much. But Lauro was used to it by now. The people don't have to love him, only tolerate him. And as he took that nap he has been waiting for, he rest easy knowing it was finally going according to plan."
 marsanich.20.a:0 "See? Things do end well after all!"
 
 marsanich.21.t:0 "Lauro In The Limelight"
 marsanich.21.d:0 "After months upon months of pleading, press conferences, statements to the public and wishing, Lauro was finally getting what he wanted. A number of phone calls and exchanges with lower bureaucracy confirmed that any notions of him being an extremist have gone out the door, and that he is in the public what he wanted to be all this time, their prime minister. Very few criticize him for his beliefs, and he can show his face in the open without needing an entire security detachment to trail him.\n\nThe government itself has restored its faith in his leadership, and is not teetering on the verge of collapse anymore. Meetings run smoothly and efficiently, senators cooperate with government decisions and party rallies no longer end in bar fights and shanking. The legacy of Hot Autumn is long past. Lauro hadn't looked this carefree in months!"
 marsanich.21.a:0 "Finally, we're getting somewhere."
 
 marsanich.22.t:0 "The Comforting Fist"
 marsanich.22.d:0 "Many said it could not ever be done, but Lauro has proved them all dreadfully wrong. His popularity is skyrocketing, the people enjoying the state's ever so gentle hand on their shoulder. Riots and protests are a thing of the past, all of them dispersing and going home, as they should've long ago. Radicals and extremists are being hunted like wild game, cornered and brought to extinction.\n\nAll those who ever dreamt of threatening Italy, all those who dared to try it, have been served the answer to such acts. Never again will such things happen, not so long as Lauro is alive and breathing. Never again will citizens be afraid to leave their houses and never again will terrorism haunt Italy's people. It turned out that determination really would see the plan through, just as Lauro envisioned it."
 marsanich.22.a:0 "Peace at last."
 
 marsanich.23.t:0 "Everything Good Must Come To An End"
 marsanich.23.d:0 "Months of calm and peace had now passed in Italy, not one report of political violence or riots threatening to topple government. The police have never had so little to do, Lauro has never had so much freetime, and the press has never had so little to report on. But, as with all good things, it must end one way or another.\n\nLauro was awoken with a jolt as a subordinate slapped a newspaper onto his desk. He almost wanted to lambast the man there on the spot, but his eyes instinctively drew to the headline. "Aldo Moro reported missing, political scene in shock!" Really. Would the work never end? Lauro got up from his chair with a haggard sigh.\n\n"I want a full investigation conducted on this, bring in the chief of police here, we need things to move fast." The subordinate seemed to understand well enough and nearly hopped out through the door, not wanting to catch the prime minister in a bad mood. Lauro tossed his suit on hastily and strided out the door. Much more work was left."

In exchange for this, the workers accept to work harder, and are far more loyal to the business and far less willing to go on strike, often working even when ill or during holidays.\n\nThis new model of business is still not in line with the cooperatives we have in mind, but it's an excellent stepping stone towards our future economic system, and therefore we shall encourage all business owners who grant a certain amount of benefits to their employees with tax cuts and government subsidies."

We shall reform and reintegrate this system into a new, centralized welfare organization, the ENPS - inspired by the original INFPS, it will coordinate efforts to help the poor, the elderly, and the other weak strata of Italian society, while making sure to widely propagandize these efforts.

Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, after barely managing to secure leadership within his party, has carried it to victory in the elections - now, the DC stands to shape Italian politics as the new decade begins. Many things must be done in order to weather the difficult situation Italy finds itself in after Piazza Fontana - and the first priority is gaining total control over the Parliament. "

Several currents, cliques, and wings dominate its inner workings, and the party keeps itself together as a result of a delicate balance between all these different components. In order to truly dominate Italian politics, Fanfani must first dominate DC - and the Prime Minister has two ideas as to how to do that. The first would be concentrating on internal support from within the party, gathering supports from other cliques - the other would be seeking help from other moderate parties in order to solidify our government's stability."

While Fanfani himself belongs to this group of politicians, he must now ensure that they answer to him, not to Moro, in his ploy to further his political clout.

Whenever they turn on the TV or open a newspaper, Italians will find the calming smile of the Prime Minister - whenever they listen to the radio, they will hear his reassuring voice.

Taking it slow might work, but we now have voters who hold us accountable. Our experts have already begun drafting initial proposals for our first phase, namely devaluing the lira. If we manipulate our own currency just right, our exports should explode.

Of the three, the airports should have the highest priority.

That's where the idea of Christian Capitalism comes in. The desire to profit without causing harm is a key tenet of this philosophy. Time will tell of such an idea will be able to stand the test of practical application."

There will be time for changes and debates soon enough, but for now, the people of Italy stand side by side in the wake of tragedy.

The ANM has cut all ties to the Italian government, nationalizing colonial assets after a long-winded denunciation of Italy's neo-colonial ambitions and fascisitc government.\n\nThe ANM's rule is hardly secure. Both jewish and conservative arab paramilitaries remain in active revolt against the government in Jerusalem, and sectarian violence has been all but exacerbated with the introduction of new ideological currents to the region. Thus far Habash's response has been ill-defined at best and non-existent at worse, in fear of further splintering his own base of supporters. It appears that increasingly authoritarian measures will need to be taken in order to return the region to any semblance of stability, measures that Habash himself is unwilling to enforce as of yet. If violence continues to escalate, however, there is no telling as to what the ANM regime will be forced to do to stabilize the region once and for all.\n\nWhatever happens, this is certain: Italy has lost its last vestiges of influence over the Levant.

ENI leadership conferences breezed by as symbolic confirmations to every decision Mattei put on the table, and even the Admiralty offered a confused sort of approval of the vigor with which the man conducted himself and his governorship.

 POLITICS_Augusto_De_Marsanich_DESC:0 "Among the many politicians of the BN who can boast a career dating back to the days of Mussolini, few can rival De Marsanich and his many years serving in politics. Serving as a member of parliament since the 1920s, De Marsanich held numerous offices before, during, and after the Second World War - and as the Duce died and a new one rose to take his place, De Marsanich immediately supported him and his projects. An old wolf of politics, De Marsanich knows that things change, and holding on to old symbols and ancient slogans is pointless - power belongs to the shrewd.\n\nOver the years, De Marsanich was fundamental in weaving together the BN from the remnants of the old PNF and other right wing groups, while Almirante was more preoccupied being the public face of the new party. However, with the catastrophe of Valle Giulia and the chaos of the Hot Autumn, the divisions within the BN threatened to rip apart De Marsanich's creation. Almirante had to go, and the party had to be taken into a new direction, one more willing to defeat the DC and the FD by their own rules - and De Marsanich, the grey eminence of the BN, was the best person to fill that role.\n\nPromising a return to law and order and the end of the red menace threatening Italy, De Marsanich appealed to the most base sentiment of the Italian populace - fear. By painting a grim picture of a nation in jeopardy, De Marsanich was voted in as the new Prime Minister to defend Italian democracy from itself - a leader of the people, an upholder of morals, and most of all a devout patriot. De Marsanich is all these things and more, but how he intends to save Italy from itself, is yet to be fully seen."
 POLITICS_Amintore_Fanfani_DESC:0 "Opinions about Amintore Fanfani tend to be varied, but there's one thing all agree on; that few can embody the soul of DC, with its infinite contradictions, better than him. Born into a poor family, Fanfani made a name for himself as a bright student and a professor of economics, but also as a staunch supporter of fascism. A devout Catholic, Fanfani at the time devoted his efforts to bridging the gap between the social doctrine of the Church and the fascist regime, even signing his support for the Manifesto of Race in 1938 and the other racial laws of the time.\n\nAs the years passed, Fanfani grew more and more disillusioned with fascism, drifting towards Ciano and his liberalizing politics. He was one of the chief architects of the DC, and eventually ended up as one of the leaders of the progressive current of the party. Opportunistic, shrewd and guileful, Fanfani always employed a smoke and mirrors approach to politics. A masterful negotiator, he was the perfect man to become the face of the DC after the crisis of the Hot Autumn.\n\nWith DC's victory in the elections, Fanfani is now free to openly play his political games. Behind the calls for moderation, progressivism and a fair and moral society, the Prime Minister knows that he is the only thin line standing between Italy and utter catastrophe. Compromise is viewed by many as a drawback, but for Fanfani, the Purebred Horse of DC, it is a weapon in his arsenal. The political machine of DC is the only one that can control Italian politics. Opposing parties, both right and left, will learn that the only way to survive in this house of cards is bowing to Fanfani's vision. A new director has entered the Italian political stage of Italian politics, and one way or another, he'll make sure that the whole orchestra plays to his tune."
 POLITICS_Giuseppe_Saragat_DESC:0 "Until just a few months ago, to most Italians Giuseppe Saragat was only one among many politicians making up the FD. Born into a middle class family in Turin, Saragat is almost the polar opposite to Nenni and his firebrand leadership, despite the two of them having a lot in common - both were exiled during the years of fascism, and both came back to rebuild an Italian left from the ashes. However, while Nenni fought his battles for democratic socialism, Saragat, with much less ado, rallied around himself the moderates of FD.\n\nWith the end of the fascist era, what the people needed was a reformist, a clean break from the past - a leader like Nenni. However, things have changed - and Italian democracy is already threatened from all sides. The chaos of the Hot Autumn and the recent wave of extremist terrorism have shaken the conscience of many, and as calls for moderation and peace rise from all side of the political spectrum, Saragat was the perfect candidate to become the polite and friendly face of the left.\n\nBy appealing to moderates and centrists, Saragat was able to paint himself as the candidate of peace and reconciliation - exactly what much of the Italian populace wishes for. Still, many are displeased with the new Prime Minister, especially in his own party. The growing radical faction of the FD is alienated by Saragat's alliance with DC, and despite all the promises, the violence in the streets of Italy shows no sign of stopping, rather appearing to escalate by the week. It takes courage to call for peace and democratic values as everything seems to be falling apart - and Saragat's resolve to hold firm against extremism and bloodshed might be the only thing that can save Italy's young democracy from an early end."
 POLITICS_ENR_MATTEI_DESC:0 "Long before beginning his tenure as Governor of the Gulf, Enrico Mattei was one of the most powerful men in the Empire. Known for his disdain for politics and his little sympathy for fascism, Mattei spent his whole life doing business - from a humble start, he soon entered AGIP, the Italian state's oil company. There, he rose through the ranks, climbing the company's hierarchy before becoming its head just after the end of the war. Yet, Mattei's ambition was far from being satisfied.\n\nAs the Empire grew massively during the war, it found itself in control of a staggering amount of rich oil reserves. A new situation required new methods, new technology, new organization, new trade deals - more wells, more refineries, more workers, more money, more oil. AGIP grew under Mattei's direction, until it was finally reorganized into ENI, an industrial and financial behemoth capable of standing toe to toe with Japanese zaibatsus. From his new headquarters in the Gulf, Mattei watched his own empire grow, becoming the main architect of the Dubai Project - a shining city in the desert, which began as a pet project of fascist colonialism and turned into a capital for Mattei's oil kingdom.\n\nAfter the Italian victory against Turkey, Mattei made another grab for power, and pushed for his nomination as Governor of the Gulf. As the oil king's rule was recognized, his plans for reform in the country are already becoming reality, as he brings the local emirs into the colony's government, while at the same maintaining a cautious friendship with the Saudis - something his critics often point out. With Dubai firmly in Mattei's hands, his ambition has been given new and powerful tools - after all, if ENI prospers, Italy prospers, and now ENI's six legged dog roars a flame that burns brighter than ever."
 POLITICS_GG_ORIANA_DESC:0 "For many in the Regia Marina and in all of Italy, Giuseppe Oriana is the archetype of an officer and a gentleman, something which attracts towards him admiration and envy in equal amounts. Serving with distinction in World War Two as a lieutenant, Oriana was again and again at the forefront of the Italian navy's greatest victories in the Mediterranean, rising through the ranks before finally becoming admiral after the end of the war.\n\nKnown for his effective style of leadership and his attitude towards innovation and modernization in the nautical arts, he soon became disliked in the upper echelons of the Italian government as an outspoken critic of fascism. Eventually, Rome found the perfect place to employ Oriana's talents, one as far away from Italy as possible: the Persian Gulf. Leading the Regia Marina's Fourth Naval Division, admiral Oriana successfully eliminated piracy from the region, allowing the Gulf to prosper and the Dubai Project to continue.\n\nHowever, things took a turn for the worse. With the Italian defeat against Turkey, a shockwave of instability spread across the Middle East, and as the local emirs become more and more intolerant of Italian rule and turn to Riyadh instead, Oriana was named governor of the Gulf, as his Fourth Naval Division is the only force strong enough to provide stability in the region. With the Dubai Project now coming to a crashing halt, Oriana must do whatever necessary to maintain order - quickly understanding that the emirs' tyrannical and petty rule is the greatest obstacle in his path. Even as a storm approaches from the desert, admiral Oriana is ready to withstand it - and should everything truly fall apart, the new Governor knows that a captain's duties include going down with his ship."

 POLITICS_Achille_Lauro_DESC:0 "'O Comandante. For his supporters, an emblem of respect and praise, for his enemies, the name is an ironic joke, a pretentious title with little behind it. Whatever you call him elsewhere though, in Naples they call him 'Mayor Lauro', and you had better have some respect in your voice while saying it. He is beloved by many and reviled by some, and for better or worse, Achille Lauro is now the second prime minister of a new Italy.\n\nAs owner of the Flotta Lauro that gave jobs to much of Naples, Lauro found it easy enough to transfer his business success into political power. Further helping him was his close friendship with the Ciano family. A man of the people despite his extreme wealth, Lauro endeared himself to the voters as president of the revered Naples football team and promoted public welfare projects that gave housing to the poor and jobs for the workers.\n\nIdeologically, Lauro has been considered a mixed bag, a man of contradictions. Unlike others in his party, Lauro has been a strong supporter of democracy in Italy, putting him at odds with fascist holdouts within BN. Lauro is a monarchist at heart, and has a warm relationship with Umberto II. Hewing back to his days as mayor of Naples, Lauro has championed numerous populist economic and social reforms, vowing to stamp out the last vestiges of anarchism and communism within Italy while offering alternative economic policies to better the lives of the everyday worker. Lauro's work is cut out for him, Italy may be destined for greatness, but it will require a firm hand and an iron will to achieve them.

 itademdiplo.1.d:0 "The atmosphere was solemn at the Camera dei Deputati, the Lower Chamber of the Italian parliament, where the entire parliament had been summoned for a common session of both Chambers. King Umberto II sat on the chair usually reserved for the President, at his sides were the Presidents of both the Chamber and the Senate, and the entire parliament, almost a thousand people, was silent, for the Prime Minister, sitting on the chair right below the King and surrounded by his ministers, was scheduled to announce the new foreign policy of the Kingdom. [ROOT.getleader] stood, facing the assembly, and feeling the King's eyes burn holes into his back: he knew that the King's support depended on whether he could truly protect the Kingdom from the enemies lurking outside, so he had to make a good initial impression. He nervously cleared his throat, gave a last look to his papers, then commenced.\n\n"Honoured members of the Parliament or, in the ways of our ancestors, Patres Conscripti! Today is a momentous day for our young democracy, as we shall decide the place our beloved Kingdom will take among the great powers of the world, as it should have always been, and as it will always be from now on!" A small round of applause from his majority, silence from the rest of the hemicycle. "After twenty years of isolationism, decided by cowards who could only try to avoid being washed away by the newly rising tide of freedom, we shall look outside! For the first time in decades, this government will make contact with the nations in Europe that still have to see the light of democracy, or have been forcibly blinded to it. We shall fight alongside them against those who would extinguish our flame! A new dawn has risen for Italy, and it will far outlast the night we leave behind our shoulders!"\n\nThis time, the applause came from the entirety of Parliament, even the opposition MPs begrudgingly clapping their hands, though for [ROOT.getleader] the greatest satisfaction came from the quiet clapping he could hear coming from directly behind him.

Until a few weeks ago, the most activity one could see there was a few Italian expatriates visiting the embassy for documents, or the annual courtesy visit from the Romanian minister for foreign affairs.\n\nNow, everything has changed.\n\nThe entire building has been renovated by a cadre of architects, and colourful Carrara marbles shine on the new, monumental stairway and in the graceful columns supporting the neoclassical façade. Even the inside has been completely renovated: engraved mahogany furniture, sporting those intricate wooden mosaics so loved by Charles Albert, embellish the official meeting rooms, while in the corridors, precious glass vases from Murano peek out from equally valuable showcases.\n\nEven the personnel has been overhauled, with more than forty new diplomatic officials being admitted, among which are economic, military and political attachès, and a cadre of bureaucrats and entrepreneurs. The Italian embassy in Bucharest is now a shining beacon of beauty and efficiency in the beleaguered East, and if everything goes as it should, soon it will bring light to all of Romania."

Valets, chamberlains, butlers and maids moved with practiced hurry through the long corridors as they prepared everything to perfection, while in the basement, vans filled with the best delicacies from across the Empire unloaded their precious cargo: wine from Veneto, grapes from Athens, coffee from East Africa and many, many others, in preparation for the grand banquet.\n\nThe next day, the Romanian monarch arrived in Rome: while the governments of the two nations started talking about alliances, treaties and incentives, the two monarchs retreated into Umberto's private study to talk about more... delicate business. Everyone knew the one holding the true power in Romania was the King, and that's exactly where Umberto II came in: he believed, as Michael was a moderate at heart, and strongly admired his Italian counterpart for having managed to restore democracy to his country, that with enough effort, he could be set on the same path. When both Kings were seated, a coffee on the small table set before them, Umberto smiled courteously towards his guest: "Dear Michael" he began, "There is so much we have to talk about...".\n\nThe meeting lasted well into the evening, but when the two Heads of State presented themselves to the press, everyone could notice Umberto's triumphant smile, and their joint declaration about "common views" and "the Crown ultimately serving the people" left little room for doubts on the meeting's results."

In the years of Hungary's entry into the Pakt, with all the erosion of Italian influence that followed, and then Hungary's abrupt exit from the alliance, a number of Italian businessmen and powerbrokers remained in the city, albeit operating at a far lower level. Now these men, resilient enough to survive the harassment of the Volksbund and the cold shoulder of the government, shall be the germ of Italy's new influence in Budapest.\n\nThe first matter of business, naturally, is to reach out to these exemplary Italians and entice them to cooperate. Though surely solid patriots all, these men will be encouraged by a simple promise. Should Hungary become a friend of the Italian Empire, they will be well positioned to displace the German business establishment and become the new masters of the Hungarian economy.\n\nTo these sweeteners, we must look to the Hungarians as well. The Imredy regime, even as it despises the Germans, is not inclined to cooperate with a newly democratic power such as Italy.

The Germans despised him for his well publicised views on the Jewish question, but as the former Regent's son, he was too popular to attack openly. The man was no liberal democrat, of course. But he was the best candidate to enact the destruction of national socialism in Hungary, and to do so without bringing about societal collapse.\n\nThe Deputy Consul set out some conditions for Italian assistance. Should István become regent, the Italian government would expect a process of democratisation, to be overseen by Rome directly. Every milestone met in this process would be rewarded with further economic and military cooperation. And, naturally, this conversation had never occurred. It would be preferable that the Hungarians believe their favorite son had won out on his own. István looked back at him, bemused, while the conditions were set out.

Every so often the 'fucking Italians' were mentioned, and all those hours became worth it.\n\nFrom the reports gathered by Bianchi and the others, it was clear that the Germans were planning something. They had been receiving funds from Germania for an unspecified period of time - Bianchi guessed it was a number of years, from the context of the discussions - and mentions of Hungarian military and government personnel were becoming more frequent. Bianchi was paid to listen and report, not make political judgements. But he knew, as did every agent he worked with, that Italy would have to move quickly to push its interests in Hungary. To fail to do so would invite the Volksbund to take a far greater role in the governance of Hungary, and killing any remaining hope for Hungarian democracy."

As soon as the camera was lowered he brought an end to the handshake, peering darkly at his interlocutor. The other man, an Italian businessman with longstanding ties in Hungary, had in the past weeks become a representative of the Italian government in Budapest. His grin remained, and the Minister forced himself to make some strained small talk. After a few minutes of trite nonsense, Reményi-Schneller excused himself. "Government business" called, he insisted, barely attempting to make the lie sound believable.\n\nThe Minister entered his office and locked the door behind him. In normal circumstances, today's events would have been a victory for any Economy Minister. The Italians had pledged to buy up Hungarian grain in bulk, without pressing their advantage too thoroughly, and in doing so had offered a lifeline to the Hungarian economy. A damned shame that the circumstances were not normal. Reményi-Schneller had clawed himself into power as a friend of the Germans. After his country left the Pakt, he had stayed in the cabinet only through lack of a successor. And today, his job had forced him to shake hands with the enemy.\n\nHis mind raced.

His beautiful Lancia Flaminia - the mainstay of the Italian ambassadorial corps - looked almost out-of-the-world as it passed the overgrown dirt road cutting the enormous refugee camp: thousands of desperate men, women and children had fled the Burgundian invasion only to find poverty and despair, and the view of the gothic Cathedral was obscured by the thick smoke coming from dozens of camp fires and wood stoves.\n\nWith a sigh, the seasoned diplomat focused once again on his task. Personal feelings and pity couldn't distract him from the orders he had been given, and he would see them fulfilled: with Goering's Germany on the warpath once again, Italy needed allies, and what better ally than someone who hates the Germans with their entire being? Convincing France to join the Italian effort to contain the Reich would be easy, but Domizio knew that turning hate for a common enemy into something more... meaningful wasn't that immediate.\n\nFinally, his car stopped in front of the Hotel De Ville - once Bordeaux's town hall, now a poorly-equipped headquarters for an equally poorly-equipped government - interrupting him from his reflections. Ambassador Del Gallo was used to much better, but it would have to do: as his driver opened the door, he plastered a corteous smile on his face and prepared himself to meet the French delegation. The storm was coming, and all of Europe needed to join forces if it wanted to turn the tide of destruction: the barbarians that once devastated the Roman Empire were now preparing for an encore, and Domizio would be at the forefront of the resistance."

In this age of extraordinary danger, however, with a newly reunited and increasingly militant Reich looming ever larger, cooperation was of utmost importance. Domizio Del Gallo was no stranger to hard bargains. After all, he had earned his spurs in the increasingly unstable world of Atlantropa and watched Italy rise up to seize a dominant place in European politics.\n\nFrench pride was something he had not come upon previously.\nLong hours and sometimes days would go by without any serious progress towards Détente, spent in arguing over semantics and impossibilities. And still...Every day the chants of 'La Marseillaise' grew louder and more numerous than those of 'Maréchal, nous voilà.' Del Gallo could see with his own two eyes that the French nation was in shambles, but it appeared to him that that the French spirit was crucially not yet lost. When the time came, France and Italy would face the resurgent Riech hand in hand.\n\nAt least he hoped they would, if he did his job well."

The grueling hunger, the columns of refugees, and the determination and unbent pride the French people had borne it all with. The French government...was another matter.\n\nWhile political friction and long-winded argument no doubt interspersed almost all of their meetings in the Hotel De Ville, compromise and comradery had carried the day, or they would not have been standing arm in arm as they now were. Disagreements were ironed out, and common ground found in enough matters to secure a positive outcome to the negotiations, one they now held up proudly: The Bordeaux Accords.\n\nTo Göring's militarist clique in Germania, the news would no doubt be received with spite. Europe was at last determined to close ranks in the face of renewed aggression by the Reich, the disunity and disbelief of 1940 would not assist the Hun this time. And should a unified front not suffice to dissuade the Führer? Well, Italy has gained an invaluable and resilient ally in Bordeaux nonetheless.

Smiling before delivering his official address to the wall of cameras and journalists facing him, the ambassador turned to thank and welcome the honored delegation from Bordeaux, telling the audience - and the world at large - of the great suffering and the great resilience he had seen for himself in the capital of France.\n\n''The Treaty of Rome marks a new age of European diplomacy. Gone is the hegemonistic exploitation of tyrants, soon to be replaced by true democratic cooperation between equals on the international stage. With Rome and Bordeaux now aligned, a new power bloc is on the rise in Europe. Just as the fascist triumvirate had stood up to Nazi terror, so will the equal and new alliance whose birth we witness today!''\n\nWith German militarism on the rise in the Riech, the treaty of Rome can be considered a direct challenge to the Führer's commitment to a war in southern Europe.

After long years of struggle and strife, their righteous cause was embraced by a fellow democracy in Europe. If this was not 1848 come again, then what could it possibly be?\n\nWith sufficient backing and international recognition, Rome believes that the French Resistance will be a far more capable ally against the rising threat of German militarism than a regime that has known nothing but defeat ever since its inception.

There is growing discontent in Hungary, not just within the halls of their government but also on the very streets and homes of the people.

Such division may prove to be the least of the regime's problems however, as now even opposition parties have begun to show signs of life, and what's more, of a willingness to fight.

We need to remind the people of this if we wish to bring them back into the brotherhood.

In short, we are trapped largely within the mediterannean in Europe and our furthest colonial extent is the Gulf.

No, what the trust determines is not the success in achieving the deal but creating an environment where the long term effects of the deal can be maximized in our favor.
