#Leader Descriptions 
 POLITICS_ARTHUR_SEYSS_INQUART_DESC:0 "Artur Seyss-Inquart is the leader of the nazi occupation of the Netherlands, but a farmer could probably do the same job and maybe even better.\n\nAn Austrian nazi that helped reduce Austria to a mere province of Germany during the Anschluss, he got the job of Reichskommissar because the Nazis believed that the Netherlands wouldn't need a blood-thirsty general or a fanatic politician to run the occupation government. His friendship with Hitler helped too, of course.\n\nHe has been in the civil administration business his whole life and that's probably the only positive thing he has done for the Netherlands; as the former Dutch territory now has an enviable bureaucratic system that ensures a smooth running of the occupation.\n\nHowever, that's probably the only positive thing Amsterdam can report back to Berlin because Seyss-Inquart's political character couldn't be more dull; when asked about which probable pretender he thinks it's the best for the Reich, he just answers that Hitler is doing a fine job and the next Führer will also do as fine. This neutrality affects his Dutch domain as the various government factions run rampant and attack each other while Seyss-Inquart watches from the distance, believing it's the best system to deal with them.\n\nAs the years has gone by, he has limited himself to sign orders to arrest and execute people while ensuring the NSB doesn't get into positions of power. But it looks like Seyss-Inquart's understanding of the term "position of power" differs from the rest of the world, as most of the low-level bureaucracy is run by members of the Amsterdam Group of the NSB while the higher posts are occupied by Musserites and Volchists, leaving the NSB two steps away from the control of the government."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_RITTERBUSCH_DESC:0 "Apart from being born into rather humble beginnings and being one of the Old Guards from the early years of the NSDAP's rise, Wilhelm Ritterbusch at first glance seems to just be another colourless party functionary. Rising through the ranks of the party he eventually found himself appointed to the Netherlands as a subordinate of the then Commissioner-General for Special Duties Fritz Schmidt, where he was quickly regarded as a competent if submissive administrator.\n\nHence when Schmidt was bedridden from a train accident under unknown circumstances, Ritterbusch quickly filled the temporary vacancy with recommendations from both Martin Bormann and Heinrich Himmler. Even after Schmidt's return, Wilhelm would stay on as Head of the Dutch NSDAP thus becoming the third most powerful man in the Reichskommissariat.\n\nAfter that however the stories diverge: One story says that in the wake of Operation Silbertanne Ritterbusch became an obedient tool of SS ambitions in the RK, right until such was no longer feasible after Himmler's attempted coup. The other side says that Ritterbusch only worked with the SS as long as necessary in the context of the Weltkrieg and then soon returned to his loyal bureaucratic self. And indeed there hasn't been any evidence that Ritterbusch has any further contacts with the SS and that his loyalty to Bormann is unconditional. And it is that loyalty that allows Ritterbusch to now finally reach his highest post yet as Reichskommissar of the Netherlands\n\nNow the most powerful man of the Dutch Lands, the question remains: Is Ritterbusch weak? Is he the loyalist bureaucrat Bormann believes him to be? Or has his severing ties with the SS not been as permanent as it was thought? Time will tell, sooner or later, time will tell."
 POLITICS_SINCLAIR_DE_ROCHEMONT_DESC:0 "For the last two decades, Reichskommissariat Niederlande has been ruled under the thumb of an Austrian. With the rise of Reichskommissar de Rochemont, a true Dutchman through and through, the region may yet return to political and cultural stability.\n\nA former Fascist along Italian lines, de Rochemont grew to admire German National Socialism and served dutifully as a collaborator, and he has spent the last twenty years leading the Völkish faction of the NSB. Filled with unbound loyalty to the Party and the Führer, de Rochemont supports increased efforts of Germanization and desires the eventual integration of the Netherlands into the Reich."
 POLITICS_CORNELIS_VAN_GEELKERKEN_DESC:0 "With the Reich ravaged by the Bürgerkrieg, the vacuum of power following Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart's death has been filled by the Dutch 'National Socialist Movement', led by Cornelis van Geelkerken. Involved in the Movement since its founding in 1931, van Geelkerken worked dutifully under Anton Mussert as chief of the Nationale Jeugdstorm, and later proved his loyalty to the Germans occupiers by serving as the Inspector-General of the Nederlandsche Landwacht.\n\nNow the self-styled Leider of Dietsland, van Geelkerken models his authoritarian government after Mussolini's branch of Italian Fascism, and demands greater autonomy for the Dutch people. Whether his open respect towards the German Reich is forged from ideology or political necessity remains to be seen."
 POLITICS_HENK_FELDMEIJER_DESC:0 "The empty throne left by the death of Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart has been filled by Henk Feldmeijer, who took advantage of the Bürgerkrieg to seize power and declare independence from the Reich. One of the earliest members of Anton Mussert's 'National Socialist Movement', Feldmeijer drifted towards its Völkish wing and supported the German Occupation of 1940. Proving his loyalty to Seyss-Inquart, he was appointed to establish and command the Nederlandsche SS.\n\nTime has only radicalised Feldmeijer, who looks to the Reich in shame and towards Ordensstaat-Burgund with envy. With greater loyalties to Ost-Paris than Germania, the new dictator of the Netherlands may be seeking to integrate his nation into Himmler's secretive realm."
 POLITICS_BAREND_BIESHEUVEL_DESC:0 "Barend Biesheuvel is the epitome of a career politician. Eventually graduating with a Masters of Law degree from the Amsterdam University (once it had been re-opened by the Germans), the young Bieshevuel became a civil servant for the Dutch section of the Reichskommissariat administration, serving the Ministry for Food and Agriculture. His political career began to expand, and he soon found himself leading an influential faction of Dutch reformist politicians.\n\nThis Dutchman now finds himself as leader of the Netherlands, a position he will likely exploit to achieve reforms for his people. Whispers have drifted towards the Führer's ears regarding these so-called 'reforms'. Some say he desires to rule his nation as a benevolent dictator, while others claim he wishes to reintroduce a system of democracy. Whatever the truth may be, the political scene under Barend Bieshevuel is destined for dramatic change."
 POLITICS_OCCUPATIONAL_AUTHORITIES_DESC:0 "With the Netherlands once again under the German boot, a provisional interim government has been established on the orders of Martin Bormann to stabilize the region. Led by the most efficient German bureaucrats, the Occupational Authorities are preparing to seamlessly transfer power to the next Reichskommissar, who will be selected by the Führer when he deems fit."
 POLITICS_DUTCH_PROVISIONAL_GOVERNMENT_DESC:0 "In the wake of the brief but brutal Burgundian regime in the Netherlands, a new force sits in the Hague. Speer has established a government of technocrats and military officials to oversee the transition of Holland from its Himmlerite system toward a Dutch-led ally in the Einheitspakt, tied politically and economically to Germania. This means a mixture of Dutch and German officials wander the halls of the Binnenhof, and uncertainty clouds the air. Dutch citizens are, however, quite a bit more welcoming of this uncertainty than they were of their previous Schutzstaffel occupants.\n\nThe Dutch Provisional Government is explicitly a temporary body. Germania aims to dismantle the Government in as short a time as possible, returning the Low Countries to civilian rule. This process will not be easy, but many in Holland are willing to endure for the hope of a self-determined future for the Netherlands, or as self-determined as those come nowadays."

#Events 
holintro.1.t:0 "잊혀진 국가판무관부"
holintro.1.d:0 "As 1962 begins, the Reich receives their monthly report from the Netherlands. Even though it's one of the firsts reports to arrive, the German secretary who receives it is always surprised when he finds it on his desk; 'Report from the Reichskommissariat Niederlande... Wait what, The Netherlands?. Oh, right! We do have a RK stablished there'. This may be suprising to some but it's the truth, and that's because the Netherlands is often forgotten by many in Germany and described simply as 'meh' by others.\n\nThe reports that are sent to Berlin are a mixed bag. While Germany doesn't have to care about partisans roaming the Netherlands (at least that the government knows of) the industry is slow due to the apathy of the Dutch and Germanisation efforts are close to none because of the money vanishing into thin air due to mysterious reasons as well as the population having a strange natural rejection to this efforts. As weird as this may sound, it is not a lie, because it's not bad enough to make up a lie for it anyways.\n\nMuch like Germany, the Netherlands also has it's own factions that want to get into power. Barend Biesheuvel has become a public supporter of Speer and Meyers-Landrut and shares many of their views and with total control of much of the bureaucracy he and his supporters are inmmune to any actions that may be taken due to their comments. Then there is Cornelis Van Geelkerken who controls most of the apparatus of the NSB, the Dutch fascist party that collaborates with the Germans and is a strong proponent of the independence of the Netherlands as an ally of the Germans rather than a puppet. After that there is Hugues Alexandre Sinclair de Rochemont, the head of the 'Volkisch' faction, that are the ones that advocate the total annexation of the Netherlands into Germany. Last but not least, there's Henk Feldmeijer and the SS, that want to transform the Netherlands into a spartan state along the line of Burgundy or Kaukasus.\n\nThe Netherlands may not be the most important of the Reichskommissariats, but as long as Arthur Seyss-Inquart is in power, Germany won't have to worry about it."

hol.1.d:0 "'Imagine having four annoying children that want to listen to the radio, but each one wants to listen to a different thing and they won't take turns. That's what I deal with everyday' That was the answer given by Seyss-Inquart in an interview in one of his trips to Germany when asked about the factionalism in his goverment. The real problem is way worse though, as every 'child' has hundreds of followers who will support 'the radio program they want to hear'. Every year the lower government positions that are occupied by Dutch collaborators are shuffled so that no factions can clearly rise above the others, but sometimes this shuffling is very complicated and gives the government more than a headache. What should we do this year?"
hol.1.a:0 "Make the shuffle"
hol.1.b:0 "Let them fight for the position they want"

HOL_germanization_tt:0 "We will continue our germanisation efforts"
hol.2.t:0 "The germanisation efforts"
hol.2.d:0 "One of the reasons a Reichskommissariat was stablished in the Netherlands was because it was supposed to be annexed into the Greater German Reich and the Reichskommissariat wouls be a temporary institution that would oversee the process of germanisation before annexation. Since the economic crash of the 50's the authorities know that the Netherlands won't be annexed any time soon and so some think that the germanisation efforts are too expensive compared to the benefits they provide, which are protests from the Dutch and a step closer to being annexed as soon as Germany rebuilds."
hol.2.a:0 "Keep with the germanisation campaigns, as small as they may be"
hol.2.b:0 "It's not worth the effort, we will skip it this year"

HOL_landwacht_inspection_tt:0 "The annual ispection of the Landwacht will be carried out"
hol.3.t:0 "The Landwacht Inspection"
hol.3.d:0 "Like every year, Reichskommissariat Seyss-Inquart has inspected the Landwacht in Amsterdam. The Landwacht is a militia that was created by the NSB after the surrender of the Netherlands in WW2 to assist in the German occupation. They are normally compared to the old German Brownshirts although they are said to be less mad. Seyss-Inquart never really liked the idea of the militia since he thought the annexation would be soon, but since the 50's he has started to favour it as is the only thing the nation has similar to a military as well as to counterweight the influence of the SS"
hol.3.a:0 "The Landwacht is more than enough to keep the country safe"

HOL_ignore_succesors_tt:0 "The leaders of every government faction will try to meet with Seyss-Inquart"
hol.4.t:0 "Seyss-Inquart ignores the succesors... again"
hol.4.d:0 "There's no doubt that Seyss-Inquart is old and won't rule the Reichskommissariat forever, even if propaganda says the opposite. He will die soon and since most of the government is run by Dutch collaborators, what little pure Germans are in the government will probably follow Seyss-Inquart's fate sooner or later. The leaders of the four main government factions (Amsterdam Group, Fascists, Volkischs and Ultranational socialists) have been trying to win Seyss-Inquart's favour for years now, so that he will name them their succesor. Seyss-Inquart has been avoiding all of them as he doesn't care who will succeed him, because he will be dead."

HOL_look_moles_tt:0 "We will look for people hiding"
hol.5.t:0 "Looking for moles"
hol.5.d:0 "Ever since the Reichskommissariat was stablished, many people went into hiding because they couldn't afford to leave the country. During the war the so-called 'moles' were left alone because the government had more important things in hands and they didn't hurt anybody. Since the war ended the state is in need of hands for the factories and the Landwacht, so every years special squads go all around the country in search of this moles. The usual procedure is taking them out of their hiding place, sending the able to factories or the Landwacht and sending the rest to camps. This process, however, gets more expensive every year and some argue it's better just to take them out of their hiding places."
hol.5.a:0 "Apply the usual procedure"
hol.5.b:0 "Just take them out"

HOL_new_rations_tt:0 "The ration quantity and quality will be decided"
hol.6.t:0 "Deciding the rations"
hol.6.d:0 "By order of Seyss-Inquart, every year a commission decides hoe the rationing of the year is going to be. Most of our resources are shipped to Germany, so even when the rations are nice they are still sparse. This commission is normally composed of Austrians that were called to the Netherlands when the Reichskommissariat was stablished and as a result The Austrian leadership has way better rations than the Dutch populace and the Dutch have to last out with the leftovers, even those who work in the government. However, in the recent years more and more Dutch have become part of the commission and they defend that having unequal rations is not in the nationalsocialist spirit and that that way the Netherlnads won't be able to be annexed because there will only be starved corpses to annex. Wether they say this to obtain more food or because they are really nationalsocialists remains a mystery..."
hol.6.a:0 "Rations will be the same as always"

HOL_dismantle_ports_tt:0 "An effort will be made to try and dismantle the Dutch ports"
hol.7.t:0 "Dismantling the ports"
hol.7.d:0 "Like every year, an effort was made to redirect the Dutch port's trading traffic towards German ports, but like every year, it failed. This year it was decided that only boats that had Dutch or German crews and waved either the German or the Dutch flag would be allowed to dock in the Dutch ports. Upon hearing the news, some ships just turned around back to their countries, making us lose their goods, while others stuffed their ships with Dutch or German exiles as crew and waved both the German and their national flag."
hol.7.a:0 "At least we tried"

HOL_demolish_building_tt:0 "We will demolish some old buildings"
hol.8.t:0 "Demolishing buildings"
hol.8.d:0 "As an effort to make the Netherlands look more like Germany, the Dutch Building Service (NOD) is entitled to demolish old buildings, specially those who were damaged by the war and then abandoned. The building demolition has become a kind of social event where hundreds of Dutch gather together and watch in silence as the buildings crumble to dust, while the SS cheers as their beloved spartan society gets closer to a reality, specially when the targeted buildings are heavily ornamented or they just have a pinch of personality."
hol.8.a:0 "It's fun looking at the buildings fall down"

hol.9.t:0 "The Death of Queen Wilhelmina"
hol.9.d:0 "Even though the government officialy censored all the news related to the Dutch Government in-Exile, a piece made it's way through censorship and it's now known all around the country; Queen Wilhelmina, the last queen of the Netherlands before the invasion in 1940, died yesterday in Canada. Queen Wilhelmina had been living in exile for more than 20 years at the time of her death, but she never lost faith in returning one day to her homeland. She abdicated in 1948, justifying she was too old to lead the fighting abroad, but she never stopped fighting. Up until the capitulation of the United Kingdom her speeches in Radio Oranje gathered together thousands of Dutch people in their homes and even after permanently moving to Canada, her various books made their way to Amsterdam through a network of Dutch spies working for the government in Exile. Wilhelmina was a symbol of Dutch resistance against the German occupation and her death has been a hard hit for all the Dutch that still despise the occupation."

hol.10.t:0 "German Moon Landing"
hol.10.desc:0 "Germany, today, proudly announced that a German was the first to ever step on the moon. Eberhard Köllner, using a rocket based upon the A9/A10 design from WW2, and as a member of a team led by acclaimed scientist Wernher von Braun, successfully landed along with a team predominantly made up of former Luftwaffe pilots. Köllner, on live national television broadcasted globally, and through thousands of photos, snapped a smart salute to the flag of the Reich, and celebrations began almost immediately across Germany.\n\nEven though German propaganda says the rocket was fully built in proper German soil, this is an exageration, since some of the parts were built in the industries of the various Reichskommissariats. We also took part in the project and Seyss-Inquart is now over the moon because he had serious doubts the project would succeed taking into account the quality of the pieces made here in the Netherlands by apathic workers. Seyss-Inquart thought the project would fail, the Germans would find out the Dutch pieces and thye would fire him while probably taking direct control of the Netherlands or something like that. But the project was a success and we can now stop worrying."

A wave of disgust has spread throughout the hearts and minds of all Germans who consider the Dutch their racial brethren. While the Party and I are likewise repulsed by your actions, so are we furious with such a blatant and degenerate display of betrayal. For decades, the Reich has sought to protect and integrate the Netherlands, and it is well within our moral justification (as well as our military power) to crush your nation into splinters if we so desired. As your Führer, I decree that the Netherlands must immediately be brought back into the Unity-Pakt to submit to the authority of the Party and the Reich.\n\nIf you accept this offer, as well as whatever restrictions we place on your new system of governance, I will allow you to continue your little democratic experiment. If I do not receive confirmation of my offer, however, I will have no choice but to declare war on your tiny nation and crush your people under the advancing march of my mighty Wehrmacht. You will be punished. Your government will be annihilated. Your families will be executed.\n\nI expect a rapid response.\n\n"

While the Party is distraught with this sudden loss, so are we furious at such a blatant display of betrayal from our racial brethren. For decades, the Reich has sought to protect and integrate the Netherlands, and as such it would be within our moral justification (not to mention our military power) to shatter your country into splinters if we so desired. Fortunately for your people, I am willing to allow you to remain in power as long as you accept the esteemed title of Reichskommissar and return the Netherlands to where it rightfully belongs – the Unity-Pakt. If I do not receive confirmation of my offer from you or your Foreign Ministry, I will have no choice but to march my Wehrmacht into your tiny strip of land and crush anyone who resists the advance. Those fighting for your conceited vision will not be spared. You will not be spared. Your family will not be spared.\n\nI expect a rapid response.\n\nHeil Bormann!"

hol.40.t:0 "The Question of Reform"
hol.40.d:0 "Barend Biesheuvel ascended to the dictatorship with a stark vision of reform in his head and a burning passion for unity in his heart. At least, that was what the public had believed when the politician wrenched the reins of power from Seyss-Inquart's cold dead hands and declared independence for his people. Now, as the German jackboot casts a shadow across the fledgling dictator's throat, he must examine his options with severe caution. If just one true freedom is delivered without the Führer's consent, the boot will crunch down and herald the arrival of a new German despot to claim tyrannical dominance over the Dutch.\n\nNonetheless, the Germans realise the importance of a Dutchman ruling over his kin. For all his aggressive blustering, Martin Bormann has ordered his Foreign Ministry to negotiate policy with our administration. After much discussion, ranging from polite refusals to screaming rants, the Germans have permitted us to enact a few minor political reforms. For Bormann, this is doubtless a means of placating the fiery Dutch masses; for Biesheuvel, these terms are nothing less than a small victory, and the potential first step towards some measure of liberation.\n\nThe loathsome influx of German bureaucrats had overseen the abolition of trade unions, the dismantling of free speech and the introduction of slavery. Under the watchful eye of its new dictator, the Netherlands will experience the restoration of trade unions and public meetings, albeit heavily regulated by the state, as well as the acceptance of non-state press outlets - as long as they accept our Reich-mandated censorship laws. While the curse of slavery will not be abolished, with enough effort we can transform it into a kinder system of limited, unpaid labour."

hol.41.t:0 "The Reichskommissar of Dietsland"
hol.41.d:0 "Hours passed by as the Leider watched his ministers squabble around him. Fists were shaken and voices were raised, apologies were muttered and forgiveness exchanged, insults were tossed and at least one punch was thrown. Finally, Cornelis van Geelkerken silenced the meeting room and announced that the time had come. The reply to Martin Bormann's brutal ultimatum awaited.\n\nA letter was travelling to Bormann's desk as the Dutch Foreign Ministry began re-opening communications with its German counterpart, but van Geelkerken had no patience for an official response from the Führer. His people were waiting. To the cheers of the masses, he marched onto the stage prepared days in advance, dramatically thrust his arms to the skies and proclaimed himself the new Reichskommissar of Dietsland. The nation's return to the Unity-Pakt was met with uproarious applause by the teeming crowd of fascists, just as the rally organisers had instructed. Reichskommissar van Geelkerken closed his speech with a statement sure to provoke the NSDAP:\n\n"My Dutch brothers and sisters, fellow comrades, what you are witnessing today is the triumph of Dutch National Socialism! I, your Reichskommissar and Leader, have rescued our nation from the dark shadow that has loomed over us for so long. Now, as we stand firmly in the sunlight, we look across, and not up, to our German friends."\n\nThere may be dissenters who believe van Geelkerken has sold his soul to the brown-suited devil in Germania, but most of the population understand that the hefty title of Reichskommissar bears no true obligation."
hol.41.a:0 "Let us help Bormann maintain his illusion of stability."

hol.42.t:0 "The Dutch Negotiator"
hol.42.d:0 "When Reichskommissar van Geelkerken proclaimed his loyalty to the Reich, he expected the violent storm of communications between the Dutch and the Germans to ease into a gentle wind. For once, he was wrong. Since his speech, the brown-suited bureaucrats in Germania had only increased their whirlwind of diplomacy in a desperate attempt to shape the future of Dietsland policy.\n\nThe new Reichskommissar had made it clear in his first letter to Bormann that he would only engage in negotiation with the Führer himself; after all, it was the duty of his bespectacled underlings to facilitate the lower levels of mediation between the two nations. A leader would only talk with a leader. To van Geelkerken's contentment, the letters from the Führer were as respectful as they were assertive, and his demands did not insult.\n\nBormann wants to be openly accepted as van Geelkerken's superior – naturally. Bormann demands the state integrates the messages, aesthetics and authority of the Reich into its public propaganda campaign – an acceptable request. The Reichskommissar can engage in his Dutch variant of National Socialism as long as Bormann's plans are not interfered with – a complex directive, but negotiable.\n\nThe greatest order of contention was Bormann's insistence that the Reich's grasp on Dietsland's infrastructure – from its trains and ports to its factories and airbases – would remain as firm as ever. If the spine of the nation is ripped away, how can the state expect to take a single step forwards? It matters not. Van Geelkerken knows that, were his ego to grow larger than his jackboots, the letters with all their polite sentences would burn away to reveal a rifle pointed directly at his head."
hol.42.a:0 "Let the negotiations continue."

hol.43.t:0 "A Letter from the Führer"
hol.43.d:0 "Reichskommissar von Dietsland, Cornelis van Geelkerken,\n\nThank for your previous letter. I have discussed your proposed reforms intensely with my Foreign Ministry, and we have reached our definite conclusions. Your desire to further stabilize Dietsland, as well as your continued open loyalty to the Reich and me, is proof enough that your appointment as Reichskommissar was well-earned; as such, I am willing to permit some minor reforms.\n\nYou have my permission to increase the limit of WA Blackshirt conscriptions to the figure you proposed, as well as to introduce your National Youth Storm as an arm of the State. In return, you must ensure that both paramilitary movements officially pledge allegiance to the Reich and the Führer in accordance with their regular routine. Furthermore, if either of these groups come into conflict with my Ordnungspolizei, I will consider restricting their conscription limits at best – and banning them at worst. I am also willing to grant you greater autonomy over state broadcasts, organised rallies and educational mandates, in the hopes that this perceived independence rallies the rebellious Dutch populace to your side.\n\nNaturally, the rest of your proposals have been rejected. We will not withdraw the German Ordnungspolizei officers from your nation, as they have proven to be effective in rooting out protest and dissent. We will not grant Dutch control over those vital areas of infrastructure that the Reich is dutifully protecting. We will not tolerate propaganda portraying our two nations as equal.\n\nHeil Bormann!"

hol.44.t:0 "Dinner with Haighton"
hol.44.d:0 ""A toast to the Leider!" Alfred Haighton smirked, raising a glass of wine. Cornelis van Geelkerken raised his with a bitter smile, took a sip, and continued wolfing down the plate of Stamppot before him. The leash around his neck was tightening. Bormann's polite but stern letters and diplomatic gestures had grown stale and synthetic, like a cluster of plastic flowers. It was not enough to restrict van Geelkerken's reforms –now the Führer wanted to tighten his grip on the Dutch economy.\n\n"As I was saying," Haighton continued, wiping his mouth with a napkin, "most of the budget is in the grasp of the Germans. What little fiscal responsibilities our state has been left with is being monitored. My hands are tied. If he so desired, Bormann could collapse our economy just like that!" The economic minister snapped his fingers.\n\n"That stumpy little cunt," van Geelkerken cursed, clenching his cutlery until his fists turned white. "First the Jews, now the Germans... it feels as though the Dutch people were cursed to suffer the machinations of money-grubbers. What these parasites suck from us can be measured in the sweat of the working Dutchman! It's a fucking outrage."\n\n"An outrage we must abide, unfortunately," Haighton sighed, polishing his spectacles. "In time, we may be given more fiscal autonomy. For now, I advise we smile and fawn. Oh, and one more thing, my Leider. I implore you not to compare Jews and Germans in my presence. I'd prefer not to find a bullet in the back of my head, thank you very much.""

Van Scheltinga marched alongside him, his face ruddy and creased.\n\n"If I find out you've been hiding any incidents from me..." van Geelkerken muttered, turning his gaze towards the minister. Despite the occasional skirmish and shouting match, the simmering tensions between the Dutch Blackshirts and the German officers of the Ordnungspolizei had not boiled over into widespread violence. In fact, while the two organisations had admittedly not worked well together in suppressing protestors and dissenters, van Geelkerken had been informed of the growing respect between them.\n\n"I have hidden nothing from you, my Leider," van Scheltinga scowled. "We have treated the Orpo exactly as we were told. Why Bormann has decided to deploy even more of those German bastards throughout Dietsland I do not know. If you ask me, it's nothing more than an insult. They want our people to believe it's the Reich that's maintaining stability here, not us."\n\n"It's more than just an insult, Daniël," van Geelkerken responded quietly, turning his back on the black columns. "It's a threat. If we don't do as the Führer says, the Orpo will have our entire government up against a wall within hours." The German leash had become so tight he could hardly breathe. "There's nothing we can do. Inform the WA leadership of the new deployment. I have a speech to make."

hol.46.d:0 ""The Führer is ready to see you," the adjutant said with a curt nod. Cornelis van Geelkerken checked his watch. 11 o'clock exactly. His arrival in Germania had heralded many surprises, but Bormann's rigid punctuality was not one of them. With a clearing of his throat and an adjustment of his uniform, the Leider of Dietsland strolled through the door to greet the most powerful man in Europe.\n\nA man in a creased uniform was standing politely with his hands clasped together, his smug smile stretching wide as Geelkerken gave a sleek salute and a loud "Heil". The Führer was just as squat and bald as the TV broadcasts suggested, and bore cunning eyes that did not belong on his jowly peasant's face. Van Geelkerken was reminded of a rottweiler in a brown suit as he shook Bormann's hand; the Dutchman knew well that this dog's bite was as ferocious as its bark.\n\n"Welcome to the Reichskanzlei," Bormann said as he gestured to a pair of leather chairs. "We shall deal with the ceremonial nonsense later. Take a seat." Van Geelkerken perched himself on one of the chairs and thanked the Führer for the opportunity. Bormann slumped into the other one with a deep sigh. "Herr van Geelkerken, you are an intelligent man. You come here expecting negotiation, but you know I cannot relinquish control of Dutch infrastructure or loosen my grip on the budget... and don't get me started on this fantasy of a Greater Dutch State. Cigar?" Van Geelkerken shook his head stiffly. Bormann shrugged and searched for his lighter. "Nonetheless... I am willing to discuss the rate of Germanization with you. Oh, and I suppose if Burgundy ever collapses, you have my permission to annex Flanders." Bormann took a deep puff of his cigar, almost mockingly. "The pompous little ceremony begins in an hour.

Following their private meeting, the two leaders gave a brief but informative conference."\n\nThe screen cut to two men – one small and stocky, the other tall and slender – strolling into a large room and shaking each other's hands with big smiles. A cacophony of clicks exploded across the room as the leaders were lit up with white light. Van Geelkerken turned to the cameras with a stately countenance. "To my fellow Dutch people, I am both proud and honored to announce that the old practice of 'cultural Germanization' has been substituted with the brand-new system of 'cultural allegiance'. The Dutch State of Dietsland is proud to stand side-by-side with the German Reich, our friend and protector, to whom we owe our loyalty."\n\nBormann faced the cameras awkwardly. "The German and Dutch peoples are racial brethren. Dutch culture – aligned with German ideals – should be celebrated throughout your nation." He turned to van Geelkerken to shake his hand again, and once more the cameras erupted.\n\nThe newsreader returned to the screen. "We are grateful, but not surprised, that the tenacious wisdom of the Leider has earned us this cultural autonomy. After this conference, the Führer hosted a grand ceremony in which the Leider, who had already accepted the esteemed position of 'Reichskommissar', was formally granted this title in the presence of NSDAP ministers and Wehrmacht officers.

At the three cars rolling up to the bottom of the steps. At the columns of security personnel lining the perimeter. At the small camera crew standing next to him, filming an Orpo officer opening one of the car doors. De Rochemont expected a gunshot, an explosion, a scream at any second... but just as rapidly as his fears had arisen, they melted away into awe as the Führer exited the car and marched up the stairs with his security team. He grabbed de Rochemont's outstretched hand and shook it firmly, the stern expression under his peaked cap turning into a smile when he noticed the camera beside them.\n\n"My loyal friend," Bormann said awkwardly, eyes flickering to the camera. "It is, uh, a pleasure to be in this beautiful Reichskommissariat, and to finally meet you in person. Your loyalty to the Reich knows no bounds." De Rochemont's chest swelled with pride. Decades ago, he had stood against the tide of degenerate liberalism by setting up the very first Dutch fascist movement; to have risen from such humble origins to the leadership of the Netherlands was almost poetic.\n\n"I don't think we'll pick up any audio with all this wind..." one of the camera crewmen announced.\n\n"Why didn't you fucking say so?" Bormann snapped, his smile wiped away in an instant. "Herr de Rochemont, this is the plan. Inside, we'll give a talk in front of the cameras. I'll commend you for your valiant efforts in providing stability and crushing resistance, and then cement your legitimacy by praising your loyalty. Afterwards, we'll have a private meeting to discuss Dutch policy moving forwards. Let's go inside, it's fucking cold out here.""
