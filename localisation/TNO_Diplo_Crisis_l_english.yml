 diplocrisis.125.t:0 "독일의 음모?
 diplocrisis.125.desc:0 "독일 놈들의 음흉함은 끝이 없는 것 같습니다. 사우디아라비아 주재 대사인 윌리엄 A. 에디가 암살 당했습니다. 우리의 정보국은 에디를 '골치아픈 문젯거리'라고 묘사한 베를린에서 송신한 전보, 암살 계획 수립을 위해 정보 수집 활동을 한 독일 정보원들의 활동 내역, 범행 시각으로추정되는 때에 현장에서 들린 독일어를 들은 목격자들의 증언을 수집했습니다. 또한 결정적으로 현장에 피가 묻은 '피와 명예' 가 새겨진 칼이 현장에 있는 것을 확보했습니다. . \n\n 우리 정부 내의 몇몇은 독일이 그런 중요 인물의 암살을 왜이리 어설프게 처리했냐며 의문을 제기하지만 대다수는 나치의 암살자가 무능했다고 간주하고 즉각적인 보복을 주장하고 있습니다. 중간에 보고서의 일부가 언론에 유출되는 바람에 국민들 또한 분노하고 있습니다. 이미 우리는 독일에게 해명을 요구했고, 그들의 반응을 기다리는 중입니다."
 diplocrisis.125.a:0 "훈족 놈들이 뭐라고 할지 들어나 볼까.

 diplocrisis.126.t:0 "미국의 지목"
 diplocrisis.126.desc:0 "양키놈들의 히스테리가 끝이 없는 것 같습니다. 사우디 주재 대사인 윌리엄 A. 에디는 부주의한 사고로 사망했거나 유대인, 볼셰비키 혹은 그 둘다인 유대-빨갱이에게 살해 당했을 가능성이 큽니다. 그럼에도 미국 정부는 우리의 명예로운 제국 정부를 암살의 배후로 지목했고 이와 관련해 수많은 거짓 증거를 수집했습니다.\n\n 이 것이 전세계에 우리의 명성을 더럽힐려는 한심한 공작임에 틀림없지만, 우리 정부 내에서는 어떻게 대응해야할지에 대해 의견이 갈리고 있습니다. 어떤 사람들은 강력히 부정하고 넘기자고 주장하며, 다른 사람들은 이 사건을 확대시키자고 주장합니다. 현재로서는 미국이 어떤 행동을 할지 지켜보는게 최선입니다."
 diplocrisis.126.a:0 "그거 우리 아니야!"

 diplocrisis.127.t:0 "독일의 부정"
 diplocrisis.127.desc:0 "마침내 우리는 독일로부터 그들이 에디 대사의 암살에 연관되어 있다는 비난에 대한 응답을 들을 수 있었습니다.: "대독일국은 이번 사건에 독일이 관여했다는 미국의 판단을 전적으로 부정하며 독일은 이번 사건에 관여하지 않았음을 알린다.\n\n 강경파들은 중동의 위치한 우리 대사관들을 요새화하고 이들을 보호하기 위해 추가 병력을 보낼 것을 주장합니다. 그러나 몇몇은 이번 사건이 독일의 중동 전략과는 크게 어긋난다는 점을 주목했고, 현 단계에서 이런 행동은 좋지못하며 재앙적인 결과를 초래할 수 있다고 경고합니다."
 diplocrisis.127.a:0 "우리의 외교관들을 보호해야 한다! 요새화하라!"
 diplocrisis.127.b:0 "증거가 너무 허술하다, 독일에게 사과하자."

 diplocrisis.128.t:0 "미국의 지목 철회"
 diplocrisis.128.desc:0 "양키놈들은 거친 외교를 할 배짱이 없는 것 같습니다. 오랜 시간 끝에 미국 정부는 오늘 우리 정부에 공문을 보내 대사 암살에 관한 증거가 허술했다며 성급한 지목에 사과를 해왔습니다.\n\n 이 위기가 해결된 것은 다행이지만, 누가 제국의 이름을 더럽힐려고 했는지, 그들의 목표는 무엇인지에 대한 의문이 생깁니다. 많은 사람들이 생각한 것처럼 빨갱이 유대인의 소행일까요? 아니면 일본놈들이었을까요? 아니면 미국이 스스로 조작한 것일 수도 있습니다. 확실하지는 않지만, 현재의 상황이 좋지 못하다는 것만은 확실합니다."
 diplocrisis.128.a:0 "경계를 늦추지 말자."

 diplocrisis.129.t:0 "미국의 움직임"
 diplocrisis.129.desc:0 "나쁜 소식입니다, 교활한 미국인들이 에디 대사의 암살에 관여하지 않았다는 우리의 해명을 인정하지 않고, 중동 전역에 그들의 대사관을 요새화 할려는 움직임을 보이고있습니다. 이러한 행동들을 미국은 예방책이라고 주장하고 있습니다만, 우리는 그들이 배치하는 병력이 대사관을 보호하는 경비 목적으로 온 것이 아니라 중동에서의 우리의 이익을 훼손하고 그들의 영향력을 늘리기 위한 수단이라고 생각합니다.\n\n이제 우리는 선택해야 합니다, 미국과의 군비 경쟁을 벌여야 할지, 긴장을 완화시키기 위하여 노력해야 할지를 말입니다. 대부분의 사람들이 이러한 행동들이 미국과의 외교 위기를 일으킬만한 가치가 없다고 주장하는 반면, 정부 내의 강경파들은 독일의 명예가 훼손되었으며 미국인들과 군비 경쟁에 들어가야 한다고 주장합니다. 우리는 결정을 위해 미국인들에게 스스로 해명할 것을 요구할 것입니다."
 diplocrisis.129.a:0 "정예 병력을 보내고 미국에게 해명을 하도록 요구하라."
 diplocrisis.129.b:0 "사과를 하고 배상금을 보내라."

 diplocrisis.130.t:0 "독일이 백기를 들다
 diplocrisis.130.desc:0 "중동에서 좋은 소식이 들어왔습니다. 어리석은 나치는 미국과의 경쟁에 나설 수 없다고 판단하고 에디 대사의 죽음에 관하여 사과와 배상금을 보내왔습니다. 독일과의 분쟁은 끝났으나 그 과정에서 배치한 병력들 덕분에 중동 내의 우리의 영향력은 커졌습니다.\n\n곧 독일은 중동에서 쫒겨나 협약의 석유 공급에만 의존해야 하는 처지가 될 것입니다."
 diplocrisis.130.a:0 "또 다른 승리로군."

 diplocrisis.131.t:0 "독일의 대답"
 diplocrisis.131.desc:0 "중동에서 나쁜 소식이 들어왔습니다. 독일군은 우리의 증원에 겁먹지 않았고 우리의 결정이 독일에 대한 도발이 아니라는 것을 증명하라고 요구해왔습니다. 지금 상황에서 독일과의 군비 경쟁에 들어가는 것은 도발 행위나 다름없으나 이 상황에서 물러난다면 굴욕일 것입니다."
 diplocrisis.131.a:0 "대사관 경비 인력을 더 늘려라!
 diplocrisis.131.b:0 "여기서 멈추자고, 병력들을 철수시켜라.

 diplocrisis.132.t:0 "미국이 항복하다"
 diplocrisis.132.desc:0 "마침내 양키놈들이 사리분별을 할 줄 알게 되었나 봅니다. 우리의 요구에 답하여 미국인들은 새롭게 지은 철조망을 두른 콘크리트 요새를 허물고 지역 내의 병력 일부를 철수시켰습니다. 우리는 미국의 위신에 큰 타격을 입혔으며 전 세계에 민주주의 체제가 대독일국의 상대가 되지 않는다는 것을 똑똑히 보여주었습니다."
 diplocrisis.132.a:0 "또 다른 승리로군."

 diplocrisis.133.t:0 "미국이 요새화를 계속하다"
 diplocrisis.133.desc:0 "양키놈들의 광기와 도발은 끝이 없어 보입니다. 그들은 대사관을 요새화하는 것에 그치지 않고 대사관 주위의 거리를 확보해 방어선을 구축했습니다. 외교를 통한 해결은 점점 불가능해지는 것 같고 우리는 미국의 도발로부터 독일을 지키기 위한 결정을 해야 할지도 모릅니다."
 diplocrisis.133.a:0 "아리아 민족의 힘을 보여주겠다."
 diplocrisis.133.b:0 "물러서자, 싸울 가치가 없다."

 diplocrisis.134.t:0 "독일이 항복하다"
 diplocrisis.134.desc:0 "The Germans continue to show that despite their great photos of power and supremacy, they are at their heart cowards. Like all fascists, their endless displays of fearsome might hide weakness and desperation. In this instance, this was manifested by their quiet withdrawal from the embassy arms race, demonstrating once more the superiority of American democracy and the free-market. \n\n With our embassies in the Middle East now fortresses impenetrable by enemies, we are free to expand our actions in the region, dramatically increasing the ability of our allies to lay waste to the proxies of Nazism and Japanese militarism. Dominance of this crucial region, and the resources therein, will give us a significant advantage in this silent war of nations, and no doubt quickly result in the collapse of our enemies."
 diplocrisis.134.a:0 "신이여, 미국을 축복하소서!"

 diplocrisis.135.t:0 "German Buildup"
 diplocrisis.135.desc:0 "It seems that the Germans have not yet awoken from their racial delusions. Putting their faith in their deluded notion of "Aryanism" rather than in cold facts as we do, they appear to be attempting to fortify their military bases within the Middle East in order to counter our own build up. \n\n While their efforts are no doubt, in the long term, futile, for the moment they pose something of a dilemma: we could reinforce our soldiers still further and put them on high alert, but challenging the German constructions even as we maintain our own will open us up to charges of escalation and hypocrisy, while backing down will threaten our growing influence in the region. We must tread carefully, we walk along a narrow path with an abyss on either side -- do we dare to allow the world to fall to Fascism, or risk destroying it in a nuclear firestorm?"
 diplocrisis.135.a:0 "Send more men and make sure they're ready for anything."
 diplocrisis.135.b:0 "Back down. We can't risk war."

 diplocrisis.136.t:0 "American Withdrawal"
 diplocrisis.136.desc:0 "Is there a better example of Jewish hypocrisy and the weakness of bourgeois "democratic" values than the United States? Their nation struts and proclaims its greatness and prosperity, yet in every instance of real challenge,  they tuck their tail between their legs and run home to hide behind their oceans. This has been demonstrated once more in our ongoing dispute related to the accidental death of Ambassador Eddy. Although the Americans were happy to stock their bases in the region full of weapons, the moment we did the same they profusely apologized and immediately scaled back their expanded defence area. \n\n Once More we have shown the world the shallowness of American pride, and its fragility when compared to the ever-enduring iron will of the German Reich."
 diplocrisis.136.a:0 "Satisfying indeed."

 diplocrisis.137.t:0 "Escelation"
 diplocrisis.137.desc:0 "It was a day like any other at the American Egyptian embassy. The soldiers made their usual rounds, albeit more of them and better armed. They had been warned that German-aligned Ba'athists were potentially preparing an attack on the diplomatic center, and so were on high alert. They stared over the passing cityfolk, wary of every black-garbed women and milk cart, ready for bombs and hidden weapons. \n\n All of a sudden a sudden movement caught their eye, a man in khakis with an unidentifiable object sprinting towards the embassy. Quick to react, the American soldiers opened fire, killing the attacker quickly. \n\n Unfortunately it turned out that the man was only a courier, hired by the embassy to quickly and securely carry messages to their contacts throughout the city. In typical American fashion, they have refused to recognize their mistake and are now claiming that the situation was orchestrated by the local German garrison. Their soldiers have fanned out looking for the "perpetrators" and the situation is rapidly threatening to spiral out of control."
 diplocrisis.137.a:0 "We can't back down now. Deploy our men to protect our assets."
 diplocrisis.137.b:0 "This is dangerous, withdrawn all units to our embassy and open communication."

 diplocrisis.138.t:0 "Victory"
 diplocrisis.138.desc:0 "Good news! The situation in the Middle East had seemed for a moment to be at the brink of war after American soldiers were tricked into killing a embassy courier, but the Germans have backed down and offered reparations. Our men had spread out around the city, attempting to bring the vile Huns to justice, and after the news reached us of the German withdrawal, they have surrounded the enemy embassy. Although the environment remains tense, we dominate the balance of power and will most likely leave this incident with significant geopolitical gains. \n\n With the German power in the Middle East weakened, we have struck a terrific blow against Fascism world wide."
 diplocrisis.138.a:0 "Another win in the fight against Nazism."

 diplocrisis.139.t:0 "The Breaking Point"
 diplocrisis.139.desc:0 "Tragic news from the Middle East. American soldiers deployed throughout Cairo in order to hunt the German soldiers responsible for triggering the recent incident in which an American embassy courier was killed accidentally by our own men, have found German affiliated points in the city heavily fortified and ready to engage. Although we have arrested a number of German operatives and their Ba'athist allies, many others have eluded our grasp, driven away our raiding parties. Many soldiers have been killed, and though local authorities are desperately urging both sides to remain calm, a number of firefights between American and German units and proxy forces have continued into the night. \n\n Many within our government are furious that the decrepit Nazi empire would dare to challenge the most powerful nation within the world, and urge immediate retaliation. Others believe that the situation has escalated far out of hand, and escalating now could lead to retaliation -- perhaps even open war devastating to all mankind. \n\n The choice is yours, Mr. President. Do we yield at this pivotal moment and demonstrate to the world that America is unwilling and unable to protect them from the fascist scourge? Or do we respond with unsparing fire and fury, risk unleashing nuclear retaliation, and be remembered as the nation that unleashed the fire of the sky upon man, brought hell upon the earth and ended the age of civilization?"
 diplocrisis.139.a:0 "We cannot back down now. May god have mercy on our souls."
 diplocrisis.139.b:0 "There's no other choice. We have to yield."

 diplocrisis.140.t:0 "Sanity Prevails"
 diplocrisis.140.desc:0 "As the world teetered on the brink of chaos, militarists in America and Germany alike advocated fire and fury, the few pacifists in each government found themselves overwhelmed by the drive to war. In the darkest hour of chaos and tension, some despised, believing that they had failed and the nuclear apocalypse was now unavoidable. \n\n But in the midst of such insanity, those in the highest halls of power saw reason, and chose to sacrifice their pride rather than the lives of all humanity. \n\n The Americans have backed down. After firefights between our security forces throughout the Middle East, their soldiers have returned to their bases, and a cable from the State Department has formally apologized for the incident, and offered reparations. The enormous defensive zones they had previously constructed have been turned over too local authorities, and troop reductions are scheduled. What exactly caused the Yankees to back down at the final moment we shall never know. Perhaps they were intimidated by the superior elan and racial purity of the Reich. Perhaps they simply decided that the death of one ambassador was not worth the potential destruction of all humanity. \n\n For now, this is a victory. Our international reputation has been greatly enhanced by this diplomatic coup, and it is now the Americans who are widely seen as warmongers jingoistic savages. We can only hope that the mistakes that brought this incident so close to sparking global war will not be replicated."
 diplocrisis.140.a:0 "Thank God that's over."

 diplocrisis.141.t:0 "Begining of the End"
 diplocrisis.141.desc:0 "Never the most stable of locals, the Middle East is seething with violence and sabotage as a result of the confrontation between America and Germany. To say that war appears imminent is no understatement -- American soldiers have been reinforced with tanks, artillery, and helicopters and are now hunting for our operatives and soldiers. Our embassies are virtually under siege, and many personnel both civilian and military have been killed. One would think that the Yankkes, with their bold statements about "world peace" and "diplomatic norms" would take it on themselves to back down and so prevent a war, but it seems that the degenerate cowards have found some ounce of courage (or madness) within their placid minds. \n\n The American escalation very clearly gives us no choice. The lives of Aryans and the honor of the Reich is at stake, and so we have immediately dispatched reinforcements to pay the Americans back in interest for their treachery. \n\n Only a few within our government and the Reichstag have dared to criticize the mood, and have already been arrested. One way or another, the hour is nigh. The old West is going to war with the New World, and whatever happens this earth will never be the same."
 diplocrisis.141.a:0 "The Clock Strikes 12"

 diplocrisis.142.t:0 "The Conclusion"
 diplocrisis.142.desc:0 "It has often seemed that the German victory in the Second World War was not of this world, but a bad dream that had somehow taken physical form. Ever since the never ending march of humanity towards progress has been twisted and malformed. The world's powers are suspicious and cruel, fighting petty struggles rather than working together for the common good. \n\n Perhaps there truly is no explanation for the phenomenon rather than the political leanings and institutional structures of these nations. Or perhaps the madmen and street philosophers are onto something, and the Nazi victory against thre free world truly was an aberration, one that set humanity on a unavoidable path towards destruction.\n\n Either way, the piper has come, waiting to be paid. When we ordered our boys into the Middle East, it was with the assumption that the Germans, cowards at heart, would back down. It seems that they had made a similar prediction. Now our forces are in open battle, and any hope of peace, honorable or otherwise, has been lost. There is no time left for last minute diplomatic engagement or public appeals. The red phone's line has gone dead, the missiles will soon be on their way, and pure anarchy unleashed upon the world. \n\n Would that we could un-make our mistakes, or will the soldiers of the earth regain their sanity, but it is too late for such meanderings. The World is at War once more, and this time it is doubtful if modern civilization will survive it."
 diplocrisis.142.a:0 "Does anyone hear hoofbeats?"

 diplocrisis.147.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Sum of All Fears"
 diplocrisis.147.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nApproximately forty minutes ago, a B-52 Stratofortress on a standard airborne alert patrol out of Naval Air Station Selfoss in Iceland radioed a distress signal and accompanying encrypted message. The message indicated that the aircraft's vertical stabilizer had partially broken off, and that the crew would be forced to ditch into the Norwegian Sea. Aboard the aircraft was one Mark 28 thermonuclear weapon, and as such, this incident is being classified as "Broken Arrow". There is a loose nuclear bomb out there.\n\nGiven known weather conditions and established USAF safety protocols, we believe that the crew is most likely alive and floating approximately 115 miles to the southwest of Jan Mayen Island. The wreckage of their craft, and potentially the accompanying weapon, would most likely still be visible from the air. There are no indications that the German military is presently aware of the situation, but given known German radar capabilities, it is overwhelmingly likely that this will not be the case within 24 hours' time. We recommend that relevant Navy and Air Force elements be immediately tasked to rescue and retrieval operations."
 diplocrisis.147.a:0 "So ordered."

 diplocrisis.148.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: Off the Radar"
 diplocrisis.148.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nApproximately one hour ago, one of our early-warning radar stations at Wilhelmshaven reported the disappearance of an Iceland-based American B-52 bomber. The bomber was being tracked, as it was on a standard patrol over neutral waters in the Norwegian Sea. It is believed that the aircraft has most likely crashed into the ocean, with the fate of the crew currently unknown.According to analysts in the OKL Technical Office, it is highly likely that such an aircraft would be carrying at least one American thermonuclear device.\n\nGiven that such a device would have landed in neutral waters, we would be within our rights to claim it as salvage if we obtained it first. Such a discovery would yield critical insights into the American nuclear weapons program, and perhaps even give us a technical edge. Additionally, the blow to American prestige would be enormous, especially if the crew members survived and were rescued by us. We recommend that you authorize a naval and air detachment to be sent at once."
 diplocrisis.148.a:0 "Let's go get that bomb."

 diplocrisis.149.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Send a Flotilla!"
 diplocrisis.149.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nPer photographs from our Key Hole reconnaissance satellites, the Kriegsmarine has dispatched a sizable flotilla of minesweepers, submarine rescue ships, and even cruisers to the approximate location of the downed B-52. Additionally, Luftwaffe aircraft have been detected in the Norwegian Sea by multiple Iceland-based radar stations. We believe that they have detected the B-52's crash, and intend to salvage the wreckage and the nuclear weapon, along with any survivors. This is an absolutely critical threat to our national security and technological capabilities.\n\nHowever, we can stop this. The CIA possesses certain backchannels within the German government. We advise that a secret message be sent to German leadership at once, demanding that they halt the flotilla so that we can rescue the crew. To do otherwise would be a blow to our national security and prestige, although it may decrease tensions. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.149.a:0 "We can take the hit. Let them pass."
 diplocrisis.149.b:0 "Tell the Germans to back off."

 diplocrisis.150.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: The Americans Let Us Pass!"
 diplocrisis.150.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nAfter a series of tense backchannel discussions between American officials and representatives of our government, we have reached a settlement. The American government has agreed to allow our flotilla to enter the Norwegian Sea and salvage their B-52 and nuclear weapon, provided that we leave any surviving crew alone. This is a massive coup for us, providing new insight into American avionics and nuclear weapons technology. Our aircraft and vessels are already approaching the likely wreck site. Within the next several days, the Reich will have triumphed in this standoff, without a shot fired!"
 diplocrisis.150.a:0 "Magnificent news!"

 diplocrisis.151.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: The Americans Make Their Demands!"
 diplocrisis.151.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nIt's official. The Americans know that we know about the crashed B-52. After a series of tense backchannel discussions between American officials and representatives of our government, the Americans' demands have been made clear. They want us to withdraw our ships and aircraft from the Norwegian Sea, and to not interfere in their own efforts to salvage their bomb. Given that they were sending THEIR aircraft on patrol near OUR airspace, this is obviously a preposterous demand. However, the threat of American escalation is clear. If we carry on with this plan, we may be risking heightened tensions at best, and all-out conflict at worst. Should we withdraw our flotilla and accede to the American demand, or push on towards the intelligence coup of the decade?"
 diplocrisis.151.a:0 "Damn their threats. Full steam ahead!"
 diplocrisis.151.b:0 "We cannot start a war. Withdraw the ships."

 diplocrisis.152.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Fold!"
 diplocrisis.152.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nAccording to Key Hole satellite data and our radar stations on Iceland, the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine assets that the Germans had been moving into the Norwegian Sea have withdrawn. It is clear from this information that the German government has acceded to our demand, and that they do not intend on intercepting our own rescue and salvage efforts. Evidently, they were intimidated by our resolve and did not wish to escalate the situation. Our combined Navy and Air Force task force is still en route to the crash site. With any luck, all personnel involved will be safe at home within the next 48 to 72 hours."
 diplocrisis.152.a:0 "Excellent work, everyone."

 diplocrisis.153.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Push On!"
 diplocrisis.153.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nAccording to Key Hole satellite data and our radar stations on Iceland, the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine assets that the Germans had been moving into the Norwegian Sea are still on course to the B-52 crash site. This is utterly unacceptable. We need to send our naval and air assets to directly intercept the German flotilla. Such a signal would likely force the Germans to back off and accept that we will be handling the crash situation. Otherwise, we would be hurting our credibility as a superpower, and the Germans would get access to a host of our secret technical knowledge. This is to say nothing of the present risk to American life. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.153.a:0 "Deploy the ships and stop those Germans!"
 diplocrisis.153.b:0 "We're not starting a war over that plane. Hold back."

 diplocrisis.154.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: The Americans Let Us Pass!"
 diplocrisis.154.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nAfter a series of tense backchannel discussions between American officials and representatives of our government, we have reached a settlement. The American government has agreed to allow our flotilla to enter the Norwegian Sea and salvage their B-52 and nuclear weapon, provided that we leave any surviving crew alone. Evidently, they were intimidated enough by our show of force and have decided the potential cost was not worth it. This is a massive coup for us, providing new insight into American avionics and nuclear weapons technology. Our aircraft and vessels are already approaching the likely wreck site. Within the next several days, the Reich will have triumphed in this standoff, without a shot fired!"
 diplocrisis.154.a:0 "Sieg im der Zee!"

 diplocrisis.155.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: The Americans Dispatch Their Ships!"
 diplocrisis.155.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nIt appears that the American threat was not an empty one. According to our naval radar pickets, a sizable detachment of American aircraft and ships have been dispatched from bases across Iceland. Their intentions are clear. The United States means to intercept our ships and conduct their own salvage and rescue operation. This is a situation that may turn deadly serious very quickly, but our ships are still getting closer to the crash site. To turn back now would be to waste that effort and give up this unique opportunity. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.155.a:0 "This isn't worth it. Pull our forces back."
 diplocrisis.155.b:0 "They're bluffing. Keep going."

 diplocrisis.156.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Maintain Course!"
 diplocrisis.156.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nOur newest analysis has provided us with sobering information: the German naval task force has maintained course to the B-52 site. There is no conceivable scenario in which the Reich is unaware of our naval forces moving into the Norwegian Sea. They're just ignoring them. Combining satellite information, radar, and known German ship speeds, we estimate that they're likely to arrive before us, giving them the chance to retrieve the wreckage, the crew, and the bomb. However, we do have a countermove available. Our ships could blockade theirs when they arrive at the crash site, preventing the Germans from leaving the area. Alternatively, we could bite the bullet and remove ourselves from these ratcheting tensions. What should we do?"

We've already beaten all the information out of him that we are going to get, so we really have no use for him anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't take long for the Americans to discover his trial and they are furious, to say the least. The President himself just threatened war if we dare execute the American, but he had it coming for refusing to comply. Right now, we believe the President's remark is nothing more than an empty threat; he has no reason to instigate a war over one dead American, especially after he was sent over here in the first place.

We need to make sure the Germans know that if they execute our guy, we will send fire and fury their way posthaste. Hopefully they will recognize our might and back down, finally sending Powers back home after his painful confinement. We could also choose to back down ourselves and let Powers die, but there is no doubt our reputation will be crushed beyond repair. It would be a mistake we could never recover from, but it would save the world from an outbreak of war.\n\nThis has become a very, very tense situation.

As we proceed closer and closer to Powers's execution, the Americans are growing more and more belligerent.\n\nWe are quite unfamiliar with the current situation, and our foreign diplomats are unsure how to proceed. The best move we could make is uphold the pilot's execution; we are already so far into the crisis that we must hope the President is feigning the threat of war. However, we can still back out while we have the opportunity; though our prestige would be shattered into pieces, we could prevent a potential World War III.\n\nIt all adds up to this decision: do we continue the execution and hope the President isn't serious, or do we finally back down, hanging our heads in shame in front of the whole world?"

If things couldn't get any worse, our military is making plans to break Powers out and bring him home, but this action is incredibly risky and could start World War III. If we attack the fortress holding Powers, we would have to sacrifice our own men while killing those Nazis, and the Germans would surely retaliate. However, if we give up our man to the Germans, the American people would hate us.\n\nOur diplomats believe we made many mistakes leading up to this moment of crisis, mistakes that could have been avoided, and now we have to select the better of two horrible outcomes. One option: we let the generals finish their plans and break Powers out, killing Germans in the process and praying to God they do not retaliate.

This will show the Japanese that any attack on Americans will result in likewise treatment to them.\n\nOf course, the choice is yours, sir. We will begin assessing what led to this situation, and try and rectify it, so that our supply missions are less likely to end in such a disaster."

The Americans haven't dared to violate the airspace since the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, and the Captain liked it that way. Time up here on these patrols was spent meditating to the hum of the jet engine, as communication was seldom unless necessary.\n\n"Sir, I think I got something on radar. Five contacts heading towards us, no IFF."\n\nThe comment jostled the Captain out of his relaxed state; he began checking his radar and sure enough, his wingman had the right of it. His board was lit up brightly with contacts, and they were closing fast! They would be on them in 3 or so minutes, if that. His radio began to crackle with chatter as his squadron discussed what this could mean.\n\n"Can that shit." he said roughly into his mic. "It's the Americans. No idea what they think they're doing.

Attu was the back end of nowhere; he was surprised a boat had decided to go there, but it was in their right to do so - and the Americans had decided to trample on it. \n\n"How many are in custody?" \n\n"Twelve, sir.

With radio systems appearing to malfunction on the ship during its destruction, 253 members of the Imperial Japanese Navy were brought to the depths of Indonesian seas in the destruction of the vessel. \n\n And yet, the most horrifying detail remains to be seen; as, according to certain reports and Japanese naval intelligence, submarines of the United States were spotted in the area frequently before the tragedy and afterwards. With 253 men killed in the destruction of the ship, it remains unclear what the future of this massacre will bring."

Sure, the destroyer had seen its more glorious days of active combat, but it couldn't be denied that there was always a certain degree of serenity in working aboard a vessel destined to protect the waters from American intrusion, all while spotting no difficulties arise and all seem clear as far as the eye could see of the deck. \n\nYet, dark shadows remained to protrude through the ocean. Of course, one could always find an unnerving shadow passing by when you work throughout uncharted seas, as the great man-eating sharks of legend passed by, or even just simple schools of fish. However, these shapes donned not the activity of any beast; rather, in a mere few moments, Seaman Second Class Hayashi realized that this was no creation of the wilds. And yet, how could that be: Imperial Japanese vessels consistently gave reports upon passing, even the clandestine submarine? However, as he began to run towards a commanding officer, the fires of war once more rang out in the Asian seas. \n\nSeaman Second Class Hayashi awoke from the explosion in a terrible fright. Flames danced with water all around him, while the red alert of danger alarmed throughout the entirety of the ship, and his own crewmates continued to run past him despite his cries. Not to mention, the great piece of metal crushing, nearly severing his leg continued to act as his own prison. While the pain and terror generated the warm tears which streamed down his face, Seaman Second Class Hayashi's face was washed away as Sumatran waters poured across his face, and into his lungs."

With a warm cup of coffee in hand alongside a well-made, warm, and buttered biscuit to enjoy for breakfast, it was undeniable that this could be some of the most simple pleasures a person of their position could enjoy at the time. \n\nThat was, until the Secretary of the Navy crashed through the doors of the Oval Office, out of breath, sweat streaming down their face, and a look of terror beyond their wildest dreams. A single paper laid in their hands, outstretched towards the President, while silence adorned the room. \n\nIt had become apparent: "In light of the sinking of the Tosa, an Akizuki-class destroyer of the Imperial Japanese Navy, claiming the lives of 253 of Japan's best sailors we could have asked for, the perpetrators of this great crime must come to face their justice. It is thus that we ask the President of the United States to remark with an official statement regarding the fiery destruction of the Tosa and her crew, brought forth from the depths of wrath stewing in American spirits ever since their loss of the Second World War. All men must face justice for their crimes, and their nation of Americans is no different than any of us." \n\nThe dark clouds of the morning continued to grow colder, more dark, and heavier as the morning went on, as Americans finally began to woke up, and will have to see the upcoming news about the deaths of 253 Japanese sailors at our hands. But that's the thing: no order was given to destroy the Tosa."

Of course, tensions were high. Of course, 253 Japanese were dead, with their corpses garnishing Indonesian seas. Of course, the President of the United States was gearing up to deliver a statement regarding the destruction of the Tosa. But, all work as it always has been. \n\n"To the dearest citizens of the United States and throughout the world. It is with the gravest hearts that I must recognize the deaths of 253 dedicated Japanese sailors off the coast of the island of Sumatra in the Indonesian isles. Yes, some of these men worked their hardest for their country, and gave their lives in doing so. It is always a tragedy and an insult to see the lives of hardworking men be snuffed so quickly and so viciously; however, is it not a greater insult to use their deaths as a reason for controversy and divisiveness? Ladies and gentlemen, I can promise you one thing in the wake of this grave, grave incident: the Naval forces of the United States of America, under the command of the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of Defense, and, finally, myself, had nothing to do with the orchestration of the destruction of the Tosa and the deaths of her crew, and, quite frankly, find it demeaning to imagine this to be the schemings of a plot against the Empire of Japan. We hold no such plans, and are completely willing to present the evidence of Naval records to ensure our innocence." \n\nAnd, at that moment, all became still in the office of the Prime Minister of Japan. Everyone remained glued to the television sets throughout the office, stopping in their tracks of carrying paperwork and the tasks of the day to focus on the words of the President of the United States. Only one thing broke the stillness in that moment: the slow, arduous printing of the official naval records of the United States, providing no signs of orders against the Tosa, despite naval patrols throughout Sumatran seas."

However, as the Secretary of the Navy met with the President that morning, the meeting came with a knock and opening of the door, rather than any crashing, thankfully. \n\n"...and so, with the evidence presented by the President of the United States and her naval military forces on recent reports throughout the Indonesian region, we officially retract all accusations of American involvement in the destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy's destroyer, the Tosa, as well as the Two-Hundred and Fifty men the vessel harbored as a crew. Nevertheless, we remain dedicated towards the cause of finding those who may have been involved in the destruction of the Tosa, and bring justice to the deaths of those brave men whose blood now coats Indonesian waters." said the Japanese Prime Minister on television. \n\nWith the sharing of another biscuit, the Secretary of the Navy and the President thanked one another for their bold efforts in calling the bluff upon the Japanese. America would see itself as the victors, sooner rather than later, and, at least at the moment, only had itself to thank for that inevitable future.

However, as the Secretary of the Navy met with the President that morning, the meeting came to make oceans of inklings, as the look in the Secretary's eyes delivered a disheartening message before words even came forth. \n\n"...and so, in recognizing the clearly fraudulent, destructive, and deceitful claim of evidence presented by the President of the United States of America and her naval military forces on recent reports throughout the Indonesian region, we officially have decided to set forth on pressing the charges against the nation for the blood of Two Hundred Fifty Three Japanese sailors, who were aboard the Tosa, which now stains Indonesia a dark, dark red. Liberty and Justice for all fits not when defeatist rage comes to claim the lives of innocent, dedicated men, and we shall see that their deaths are paid for, one way or another." said the Japanese Prime Minister on television. \n\nThus began the assembly of the President's administration and the weight of the world fell upon the shoulders of every great official of the White House. The Prime Minister was in a wild bloodthirst in his thirst for vengeance, and our brightest minds have come with two potential solutions on how to deal with the lust for destruction of the Japanese Prime Minister: assume responsibility for the destruction of the Tosa, and the death of her crew members, and withdraw all submarines from the region in an immediate form of apology and respect, or continue to recognize our innocence in the situation, and declare our intent to maintain our naval presence, including offering reconnaissance aid in investigating the sinking of the Tosa."

The price continued to be debated between the Prime Minister and so many within his administration; however, an air of confidence breezed through on the President's approach to the podium to discuss the United States' stance on the accusation on live television. \n\n"Nevermore should this world bear to stand to see the horrible crimes of war ending in the death of sons, fathers, and husbands, and all manner of woman serving her country. Although the greed and vanity of man has pushed towards so much bloodshed in the past, we mustn't stoop to this level any longer. It is for this reason that the United States assumes responsibility of the destruction of the Imperial Japanese Destroyer, the Tosa, and the death of her crew, whether directly or through the mishandling of military coordination. Thus, in full, we shall work to apologize for our actions in the Pacific and build towards a better tomorrow, repaying the damages we've brought about and ensuring a better world of tomorrow" \n\n Thus, while the strong and business-like atmosphere of the office of the Prime Minister of Japan remained for the rest of the day, it was those workers, and the Prime Minister himself, who drank and sang in song of their victory today.

The answer is clear: the Imperial forces of Japan staged the bombing of their ship in order to fool the world into a lie that we are to blame over this entire affair. Thus, it is the White House's full intention to coordinate reconnaissance missions over the Indonesian territories to find and investigate the destruction of the Tosa, and hope the Japanese recant all manner of incoming threats." \n\nWas this meant to be a joke? Was it meant to be a light-hearted manner to the President as they addressed the nation? These suppositions matter not, as the insult in the message laid in the soul of every member of the Japanese nation watching.

Not only threaten the rest of the world attempting to help, but single out our own armed forces? It was unacceptable, to be sure.

However, the Empire of Japan's official statement made it clear that no international investigation force will be permitted through the waters to carry out any form of investigation. It is thus, in honest intent, that we seek to avoid conflict with the Japanese people, and allow them to conduct their own investigation and operate procedures as they see fit."

As we speak, the aircraft alone approaches at a vector aligning it with the site of the Tosa's destruction. How shall we proceed, Prime Minister?" \n\nThe cold realization of the incoming potential of death and destruction struck through the Prime Minister's mind.
