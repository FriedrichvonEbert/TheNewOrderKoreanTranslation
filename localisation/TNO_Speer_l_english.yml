 POLITICS_BUNDESKAISER_GERMANY_DESC:0 "'누구도 슈페어의 후드티를 사면서 연방황제 슈페어가 히틀러의 침실에서 2D 마인호프와 결혼하면서(빅토리아 루이제는 꺼지라지 :)) 했던 대단한 말을 해줄 필요가 없지. \n\n지금부터! 연방황제 슈페어쿤은 대게르마늄국을 존나 정상적인 방법으로 통일할거야. 부르군트 딱 대"

 POLITICS_SPEER_GERMANY_DESC:0 "알베르트 슈페어에 관해서는 많은 이야기들이 있지만, 누구도 그의 야망만큼은 부정할 수 없습니다. \n\n다른 많은 이들과 달리 슈페어는 이제는 고인이 된 총통의 맹렬한 연설이 있던 1931년의 그 운명적인 날 나치당에 가입하지 않았습니다. 베를린에서의 유세 도중 아돌프 히틀러가 한 침착하고도 정돈된 연설은 젊은 건축가를 매료시켰으며, 그는 1년 뒤 당에 가입하게 되었습니다. \n\n호기롭게 당원 생활을 시작한 그는 요제프 괴벨스의 추천서를 받게 되었으며, 이내 지역 나치당 본부들을 바로잡는 위원회의 일원이 되었습니다. 이윽고, 총통께서 개인적으로 그에게 관심을 보이셨습니다. 히틀러는 슈페어의 비전에 감탄을 마지 않았고, 둘은 함께 새로운 독일을 위한 계획들을 만들어나갔습니다. \n\n전쟁이 끝날 때, 슈페어는 총통의 가까운 친구였고, 자기 부처를 관장했으며 독일국의 경제를 승리의 기계로 탈바꿈시킨 장본인이라는 명성을 누렸습니다. 그 과정에서 얼마나 많은 생명이 희생되었던 간에, 새로운 독일이라는 꿈은 실현되었습니다. 비록 명성은 대부분 사실이 아니었지만, 그는 모두가 자신의 공이라고 알도록 했습니다. \n\n게르마니아가 건설되던 도중, 경제는 박살났고 그의 거만한 꿈 역시 함께 무너졌습니다. 누군가에게 책임을 씌우는 것은 쉬운 일이었습니다. 슈페어가 전쟁을 이기기 위해 만들어낸 체제인 노예제는 평화를 맞이한 독일을 무너뜨렸습니다. 이는 전례가 없던 재앙이었습니다. 슈페어는 감히 이를 무시할 수 없었죠. 독일국과 독일민족은 위대해질 자격이 있었습니다. 그의 꿈 역시 현실이 될 만 했습니다. 개혁이 필요했습니다. \n\n수 년 간 나치당 정책에 대한 공개적인 비판이 있었고, 이내 슈페어는 전혀 예상치 못한 곳에서 다시 한 번 자신의 운명을 깨달았습니다. 수십 년간 독일에서 볼 수 없었던 대규모 개혁의 대표자로서 말이죠. 슈페어의 야심찬 목표와 반대자로서의 명성은 유례가 없었던 정치적인 폭풍 속에서 수많은 젊은 몽상가들과 늙은 경쟁자들이 주변을 둘러싸도록 만들었습니다. \n\n이제 그는 자신이 만든 줄 위에서 아슬아슬하게 줄타기를 하며, 자신의 미래 뿐 아니라 독일국의 미래를 위해 균형을 유지합니다."

 POLITICS_NATSOC_SPEER_DESC:0 "한때는 알베르트 슈페어가 수천 명의 대중들 앞의 연대에 서서 모든 독일인들이 배신자를 축출하고 겁쟁이와 볼셰비즘을 분쇄해야 한다는 연설을 한 적이 있었습니다. 당연히 그는 자신이 내뱉은 말의 대부분을 절대 지키지 않았고, 단순히 그의 기반을 선동하고 지지를 강화하기 위해 연설을 한 것 뿐입니다. 하지만 알베르트 슈페어는 자신의 능력을 과대평가했고, 강경파들의 능력은 과소평가했습니다. \n\n사인방의 손아귀 속에서 그가 기다릴 운명은 이제 덧없는 생각에 불과합니다. 그는 테오도르 오버랜더와 나치당 내 테오도르 파벌에 합류했고, 자유주의적 분위기의 학생들의 허수아비가 될지도 모른다는 그의 걱정은 이제 거의 피해망상에 가까운 것처럼 보입니다. 독일국의 '개혁자'라는 그의 이미지는 무너졌고, 이제 남은 것은 타락한 국가 사회주의 사상의 발 아래에 짓밟힌 비전의 사나이라는 이미지 뿐입니다. \n\n알베르트 슈페어가 웃으며 새로운 독일인을 위한 새로운 독일국의 건설을 고민할 수 있는 날은 얼마 남지 않았습니다. 이제 그는 명령을 따르며 자신의 사상을 갈기갈기 찢어버릴 꺼지지 않는 분쇄기를 멈추려 노력합니다. 슈페어는 아돌프 히틀러가 자신을 바라보며 자신이 세웠던 업적들을 존중하지 않을 거라 여길 것이 분명합니다. \n\n하지만 이제는 다를 것입니다."

 POLITICS_FASH_SPEER_DESC:0 "더이상 알베르트 슈페어는 단순히 히틀러의 거창한 계획들에 가려진 천재 건축가가 아닙니다. 또한 더이상 알베르트 슈페어는 독일의 전성기에 군수 및 전시 생산부 장관을 맡았던 자도 아닙니다. 그는 자신이 고삐를 잡기 전 수렁 깊숙이 빠진 독일을 실패의 구렁텅이에서 빼낸 구원자도 아닙니다. 알베르트 슈페어는 더이상 어느 정도 충성스러운 자유주의자들과 느슨한 연합을 형성했던 굉장한 언변을 가진 정치 고수도, 그럴듯하게 개혁파 수장의 이미지를 보여주어 남들이 자신을 지지하도록 하던 예스맨도 아닙니다. 알베르트 슈페어는 더이상 "좋은" 국가 사회주의자도 아닙니다. \n\n그는 본 모습을 되찾았습니다. \n\n노예반란은 그에게 최종 시험이었습니다. 그가 생각하기에, 노예 반란이야말로 천년제국의 진정한 총통인 자신을 완성시키거나 파괴할 것이었고, 그는 여기서 성공을 거뒀습니다. 슈페어는 최악의 결정을 시행하는 것을 막은 라인하르트 게렌에게 고마움을 느낍니다. 게렌은 슈페어를 이용해 먹으려고 그를 살려줬는데도 말이죠. 반면 헬무트 슈미트는 슈페어를 허수아비로 만들고자 했고, 슈페어의 분노는 끓어 넘치기 직전까지 자라고 또 자랐습니다. 게렌이 슈페어를 돕고 나서자, 그는 고통에서 해방될 수 있었죠. 이제 그는 아돌프 히틀러가 남겨 놓은 왕좌의 정당한 후계자로서 독일 민족의 미래를 결정할 것입니다. 4인방은 어떡하죠? \n\n그들의 운명은 슈페어의 손아귀에 있고, 슈페어는 그다지 자비로운 사람이 아닙니다. 그는 각자에게 자신만의 판결을 선고할 것입니다. \n\n헬무트 슈미트부터 시작해볼까요?"

 POLITICS_AUTHDEM_SPEER_DESC:0 "국가 사회주의는 실패했습니다. 국가 사회주의는 직면한 모든 도전에서 실패했으며, 이제 무너져 멸종을 앞두고 있습니다만...누구를 탓해야 할까요? \n\n알베르트 슈페어는 어디서나 화살이 자신을 향하고 있음을 깨달았습니다. 하지만 NSDAP가 자신을 망쳤다는 사실은 깨닫지 못했습니다. 자유주의자들은 독일 사회의 도덕심을 타락시켰고, 공산주의자들은 유대인들의 선전을 통해 영향력을 행사하고 나치를 위협하고 있습니다. 슈페어는 더 좋은 독일을 위해 계속해서 싸우길 희망하지만, 그러기엔 완전히 무너져버렸습니다. 그는 대부분의 시간을 집무실에서 멍을 때리는데 사용하고, 건성건성 서류를 뒤적이며, 총통의 권력이란 이제 술책에 불과하다는 사실을 알고 있습니다. 가끔 슈페어는 하이드리히와 같은 사람들을 되새깁니다. 아마도 하이드리히의 의견에는 옳은 점이 있었을지도 모릅니다. \n\n헬무트 슈미트는 범죄자들 중에서도 최악의 인간이었습니다. 그는 냉소를 지으며 반대편의 자신을 바라보는 거울 너머의 인간 같은 자였습니다. 슈미트는 아리아 민족의 몰락 그 자체이지만, 끝내 그가 승리하였고 슈페어와 같은 작자들은 사라질 일만 남았습니다. \n\n알베르트 슈페어는 실패했습니다. 그는 직면한 모든 도전에서 실패했으며, 이제 무너져 비극을 앞두고 있습니다만...누구를 탓해야 할까요?"

In lieu of continued military occupation or colonial rule, they would see the Einheitspakt reformed into a hegemonic union of the Reich and a collection of satellite states or protectorates. It would make non-Germans far more amenable to working with us and prove our good intentions, but at the cost of considerable loss of direct control.\n\nConservative elements of the NSDAP, having been brought in line with the Führer's way of thinking, propose the continuation of direct German rule over our conquests, with politically acceptable natives serving an auxiliary role in our administration.

We saw what happened in the days before National Socialism: degeneracy, weakness, depravity and disease. Ethnic Germans found themselves terrorized across Europe, persecuted by Poles and Bolsheviks in particular. Hitler only acted in defense of his race and culture - the world's colonial powers did the same thing throughout the world, and for much less noble reasons!\n\nThere will be no more pointless violence or forced expropriation of land, but the notion of treating the lesser races as we do our own is too extreme. How can we ask our citizens, soldiers and colonists to give up what they have earned in our decades-long national struggle? The hierarchy remains, though of course we will take steps to rationalize and moderate it, for the sake of European harmony and the long-term security of the Reich."

Al-Andalus, Rome, Achaemenid Persia - all of these 'tolerant' and 'multicultural' societies ultimately fell to infighting and ethnic strife. When we enforce strict separation between races, we act in everyone's best interests.\n\nIt's better this way. One can maintain a hierarchy without hate; must the worker hate his boss, or the layman hate his priest? Divisions exist elsewhere in society, in class, income and culture, but nobody complains about those. Recognizing and supporting the clear delineations between races is natural, sensible and humane."

Hospitals and parks! All theirs, now and forever, without our own people imposing on them.\n\nWe learned from the Americans once before, when the Nuremberg Laws were first enforced.

While the various factions within the Reich have motivations ranging from the selfless to the racialist, all but the most die-hard fanatics and industrialists agree that slavery must end.\n\nHowever, ending a system that has existed for more than twenty years will be neither simple nor easy.

The former will devise the plan, whilst the latter has the unenviable task of selling it to the entire Reich.

Using a workforce composed solely of slaves means immense profits for these corporations given their lucrative state and military contracts. Their CEOs enjoy lives of disgusting wealth and luxury entirely incongruent with National Socialism's core principles, while the common people starve and slaves are ground to mulch in their millions.\n\nTo tear the Reich free from the grip of the mega-corporations, we must be equal parts ruthless and cunning in our dealings with these parasites. Even with their most ardent supporters purged from the NSDAP and bureaucracy, they wield considerable political influence in the Reich to say nothing of their economic clout.

That this happens to mean far more humane treatment is an important bonus that will ingratiate us with the slaves themselves, the reformist movement and the international community.\n\nSlaves can now expect generally less demanding work, ordinary hours and some basic human decency. Of course, they are still not free - but anything is an improvement for them at this point.

Our reforms face a great deal of opposition from those who claim to be 'on our side' already; we don't need these crypto-Bormannite rats gnawing at our foundations too.

This is the issue that anti-slavery radicals always fail to answer adequately. The Gang of Four, however, worked with the Führer on this for years, and hit upon an ingenious solution.\n\nDubbed the 'Rückführungsprogramm', this solution is set up in two stages. The first is the abolition of slavery. This will see all slaves placed under the direct administration of the Reich government and granted special status. They will be confined to special districts and camps - though in far more humane conditions than the old Konzentrationslager. The second stage, which will be far more difficult, is to repatriate every single former slave to their nation of origin.

The megacorporations have gotten too big for their boots and have no excuse for continuing to demand our help. Why would we support their interests when they actively work against the common good? How can assisting them possibly be worthwhile when they are the ones responsible for the long German depression in the first place? To hell with them!

It's time to give every good, hard-working businessman a shot at doing business with the Reich government.\n\nContracts previously given to megacorporations will be gradually rescinded, divided up and reassigned by Führer Directive. Meanwhile, new ones will be drafted by Erhard working in conjunction with representatives from the business community. The Führer has voiced his concerns about decentralizing military production, but Erhard has dismissed them, assuring him that there is no longer a need for ultra-centralized mass production of armaments.

He no longer has to resign himself to buying the same poor-quality, mass-produced junk from the Reich's largest corporations. Consumer morale, for lack of a better term, has massively increased as a consequence. That's nothing compared to the economic benefits we are already beginning to see, however.

Kiesinger and Erhard have worked together to devise a way to give hope to our youth, as well as anyone else who missed out during the Hitler years.\n\nA massive funding increase for schools will be issued as soon as possible. The Reichstag is almost wholly behind the idea, with only the useless 'Old Fighters' and stingy bureaucrats being opposed to it.

You wouldn't send an untrained conscript to fight a war, and you shouldn't send a clueless young man to build a house.\n\nMore trade schools, such as those previously proposed by Erhard, should be established across the Reich.

Erhard has long been an advocate of lowering taxes and his logic quite thoroughly trumps any ideological excuse the NSDAP can come up with.\n\nDropping tax rates will take a lot of pressure off the lower and middle classes, who represent the bulk of the population and therefore the bulk of consumers.

Germans labored for decades under Hitler, always believing in his promises that a better life was just around the corner. He always disappointed them, and no amount of wealth looted from France and the east could turn his short-lived gains into permanent success. In our victory over the 'plutocracies' of Western Europe and America, we found only poverty and ruination. Now the fruits of 'plutocracy' are available for all the Reich's citizens to enjoy, and they begin to wonder: where lies the credit for this success?

Neither worked, and the working class has simmered away in silent resentment for years, deprived of work by slavery and kept alive with only token welfare from the state.\n\nThe solution to this long-standing issue was obvious: give them what they damn well need. Workers want to work! They want to make an honest living and support themselves, the same as any businessman or career bureaucrat.

Previously suppressed communiques have revealed unauthorised targeting of native communities throughout Eastern Europe.

Military police are an absolutely essential part of any modern army; they maintain control of occupied territory, and also ensure that soldiers follow both civilian and military law. Unfortunately, the Heer's watchmen have developed a reputation for... poor conduct, to put it lightly. Often ordered to take no half-measures when dealing with unruly civilians, massacres by over-stressed or heavily Nazified gendarmes are all too common in the East.\n\nWe have to put a stop to atrocities committed by those who claim to uphold the law. The Führer put an end to the Gestapo, but we needn't go that far. Gendarmes who have records of criminality will be prosecuted if possible, while those who are otherwise unfit for service will be given early retirements. In their stead, we shall raise a new, more ethical Feldgendarmerie - one that does its job, and does it well, without any of the brutality or bloodshed."

If we don't change our ways, the guilt will not fall solely on Bormann, Heydrich, Göring and their comrades, but on you and me, your wives and mine, your children and mine, the people of Germany and all the generations to come."\n\nWe must accept our failings. The Heer's crimes aren't entirely our fault... but they are our responsibility. Perhaps history will never exonerate us. Perhaps our esteemed Führer will write the history books, and conceal the truth of Germany's fall into darkness. But we can claim one victory - it will forever be a fact that we took a stand against Nazism, and began to right the course that our nation was set upon nearly forty years ago. Now, we can only pray that our decisions are never forgotten by those who succeed us."

An army's image is best represented by its leadership, and many reactionary and militarist officers have retained their ranks. Whether they are committed foes of our regime or simply misguided, this will not do.\n\nThe most troublesome officers must be reassigned or retired.

The Russian concept of 'Deep Battle' has some very interesting aspects, even if OKW is dismissive of its innately Russian character. The Americans have also made great strides in recent years and gave our men a hard time in South Africa; we should assess our performance in that war and see what there is to learn from it."

We've nothing to gain from constantly up-scaling our equipment, besides mildly amusing photographs that someone will see in a history book and laugh at someday.

They must establish a synthesis between restraint and freedom, between voluntary subordination and conscientious leadership, between pride in oneself and consideration for others, between rigor and compassion.

While never escalating to the insanity one hears of from Japan, the constant bickering of the three branches stymied efforts during the West Russian War to effectively deal with the Bolshevik threat. Before that, the Luftwaffe listened to the Reichsmarshall rather than OKW when it pleased them, while the Kriegsmarine was happy to ignore any and all goings-on that didn't occur at sea. Add the SS to the mix, and one might wonder how we even won the Second World War at all.\n\nThe independence of the Wehrmacht's branches must be reduced a little, and all three sections of OKW convened regularly. Every member of high command needs to be fully aware of what his counterparts are doing at any given time. This way, the Wehrmacht can avoid any complications borne of professional pride and senseless secrecy. Every one of us, from the humble infantryman to the Reichsmarshall himself, has a responsibility to do his duty above all else. There is no room for self-aggrandizement in the Reich's armed forces."

He can continue being commander-in-chief, but his political games are selfish, reckless and detrimental to our success. We serve the Reich, not its leader.

With their total control over the oil trade in the Middle East, and the protective barrier of the Alps, Italy sits on a fortress just asking us to try and come for them.\n\nIf we truly want to stabilize our border situation, perhaps we should come to an accomodation?

Now, however, things have changed: pumped by the absolute monopoly over oil trade, and helped by a cunning and pragmatic diplomatic policy which let them trade with both the OFN and the Japanese Sphere, the Italian economy is at risk of surpassing our own, especially after the civil war...\n\nNow, the embargo is suffocating us, and we desperately need to access the Italian markets.

GER_the_city_of_angels_desc:0 "The Americans have called Schmidt to the West Coast, bringing him to Los Angeles. He could see their museums, their piers, and their unique natural features. Although he may miss seeing Lady Liberty, Wall Street, and Central Park, it would be pleasing for him to see what lies to the Pacific.\n\nAlthough our former Japanese allies may have won some concessions from them, that is not our business. Let Schmidt enjoy the sights of this great city. Perhaps letting him lay his eyes on their beaches and letting him explore Hollywood could give him insights into the culture of our counterparts."
GER_wiping_our_hands_clean_desc:0 "Our Fatherland shall no longer have to deal with the horrific stains of wars, both within and without, and neither shall it deal with the memories of those who have once promised us the future but gave us ashes. And to show to the Americans that we have changed, we have washed ourselves clean.\n\nThey are beginning to appreciate us for who we are now and what we have become. We are born again. Our Fatherland shall be born again."
GER_a_dine_in_at_the_white_house_desc:0 "Our foreign minister has done well. And he has enjoyed his dinner at the White House. Things are looking good for both the Americans and our people.\n\nOur great Fatherland made sure this won't go to waste. Schmidt shall have signed the papers with the President, signing away together the embargo which has wedged itself between our two great countries."
GER_lying_congressional_style_desc:0 "We face a fork in the road. Two simple choices, tell the Americans the truth about our country. Or we can lie to them.\n\nIf we lie, we must make it realistic. We must present ourselves strongly. And while speaking the truth would be great, it might benefit them more than us.\n\nAfter all, it's natural to lie, but it's hard to tell the truth. And while it would set us free, would that give us money?"
GER_an_invitation_to_hamburg_desc:0 "Sending an invitation to our American counterparts is good. But inviting them to Hamburg is better than merely bringing them into the heart of our Fatherland.\n\nShowing them one of our largest cities would certainly impress them. And this would allow us to show some of the best of our country. And there, we would be free to discuss issues with their delegation. Let us hope that extending our hand to the West would be rewarded with their appreciation of German hospitality."
GER_relocate_the_protestors_desc:0 "We know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the American's arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things.\n\nThankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful. Speer and Gehlen have sent armoured trucks and men with guns into Hamburg, quickly and effectively taking care of the rioters and moving them elsewhere. At least for now, our faces are saved."
GER_accelerate_the_rebuilding_desc:0 "It is going to cost us money. But money is something that we can replace; time is something we cannot.\n\nIt is important for us to rebuild Hamburg as quickly as we can, no matter what. And no matter how much this may ask of us, it is better to do this than to disturb the Americans with reminders of our civil war.\n\nAccelerating the efforts of our Fatherland to restore the beauty of this great city shall be a priority."
GER_fill_the_mass_graves_desc:0 "We have buried many bodies here. But it isn't enough. Unfortunately for us, there are still some that remain.\n\nIt's going to take too long for us to get the ones that are still around in Hamburg taken care of. We have to get them out of sight. Quickly, or the Americans will see our shame, our human loss.\n\nAs long as we can find holes for these corpses and bury them deep, our guests will never have to complain nor worry about anything."
GER_shiny_happy_people_desc:0 "The war for the fate of our Fatherland has not been good to our people. And as a consequence, they cannot help but feel miserable and exhausted about things. We cannot allow this to be.\n\nAlthough Hamburg is one of many cities which has suffered from the pains of the Burgerkrieg, the Americans must not see how far our people have gone down with their attitudes. Let us make sure that we show our guests that we are capable of putting on our best smiles."
GER_a_night_in_wonderful_hamburg_desc:0 "The American delegates have come to Hamburg. And now, our great Fatherland has the opportunity to show to our former enemies, who are now here to sit down with us and talk peace and security, that our Reich is as wonderful as we wanted it to be.\n\nAlthough we had to hide some of the things we could not bear to leave lying around, at least we can warmly get our guests settled in for the coming talks. And for now, it is time for joy.\n\nLet's make sure they have a beautiful night."
GER_just_like_in_washington_desc:0 "We have done so much. We have to put away what should never be seen. And we have hoped that they would never realize what has changed.\n\nIt worked. And now we have them on our side. It's time for us to get ready for the best part of this show. Preparations for the journey over the Atlantic must be undertaken. "
GER_the_unity_fair_desc:0 "It would be all too easy to bring the Americans to our side. And we can't just beg them to end the embargo. That would certainly be terrible manners on our part.\n\nNo. Instead, let us make a spectacle. Yes, let us appeal to their people, not just to their government. And we have just the plan.\n\nA fair, for all the world to come and see, to experience and to remember, at Boston, would most certainly be our best shot at making the American people more agreeable to sitting down with us."
GER_once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood_desc:0 "Working with the Americans doesn't always mean maintaining a mentality centered around work alone. No, let us make sure that our counterparts can realize that we too appreciate some time off.\n\nAnd by this, we do mean that we appreciate cinema. And if we can get our American counterparts to enjoy some films with us, perhaps that will make things easier for them to digest during our talks.\n\nA film festival right in Hollywood should do the trick. If Norma could ask for a close-up, so can our Margit, Elke, and Marianne."
GER_fear_and_loathing_in_reno_desc:0 "Our American counterparts love their planes. We too love our planes.\n\nParticipating in one of their greatest air shows at Reno would be a fabulous opportunity for our Fatherland to display the best of what our brightest engineers and technicians have created. And it certainly would wow the Americans with our skill at the machine, our mastery of the engine, and our innovative spirit.\n\nYes, we shall present to them our finest jets. Behold! The screaming 88s!"
GER_a_night_to_remember_desc:0 "All those visits, all those wonders, and all those pleasures. All these things have come to an end. And now, it is time to make an impressive conclusion.\n\nFor look! Schmidt has received an invitation to dine at the White House with the American President! Isn't that something?\n\nThis is our country's chance at getting the Americans to sign away this terrible embargo. And for the good, not only of our country, but for them and the rest of the world. Truly, as they say, this shall be a night to remember."
GER_opening_the_doors_desc:0 "It is time for our Fatherland to persuade the Americans to lift their embargo. And it is also time for us to open the doors of Europe to the West, and for the West to do the same for Europe. We can no longer exist with a barrier between us.\n\nIt is best for us all to remove the wedge between us."
GER_the_sins_of_the_father_desc:0 "Before we can even sit at the same table with our partners from America, we have to show that we can go forward without Hitler's influence.\n\nWe are a new Germany, and to the Republican-Democratic party, we must help them see who we are now instead of who we were before.\n\nWhat we are now must not be tainted by who we were before."
GER_are_not_the_sins_of_the_son_desc:0 "Our Führer, Albert Speer, has never done anything wrong. He never involved himself with the ugliness which Hitler himself got into.\n\nUnlike him, our new Führer desires to make things right. This is what we believe, and that is what the world should too.\n\nThis is his way, and therefore our way, of setting ourselves apart from the legacy of our fathers."
GER_distance_ourselves_from_hitler_desc:0 "The name Adolf Hitler will forever echo through the grand halls of history, inspiring both hope and fear into those who hear it. The threads of fate weaved together the tapestry of this man's life, from the darkness of Vienna's filthy slums to the radiance of the Reichstag. His ascension to Führer of the Greater German Reich and saviour of the Aryan people is a monumental fragment of history, and to belittle his significance would be to deny reality itself.\n\nNonetheless, the Führer was but a man, and so too would it be foolish to deny his faults. Many within the Party refuse to acknowledge the flaws of their hero, but these attitudes must be altered if we are to progress as a nation. The question remains as such: should we completely destroy Hitler's cult of personality, or must the subject be tackled with a lighter touch?"
GER_death_to_the_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "The time has come to embrace total dehitlerization for the good of the German Reich. No longer shall the Party worship Hitler as a figurehead of National Socialism and messianic saviour of the Aryan race. It is our duty to acknowledge that Hitler was a mere man driven by power and prone to committing unspeakable actions, even against his own people whom he claimed so often to love. This drastic change in National Socialist thought will doubtless spark fury among the conservative wing of the NSDAP, but it is a risk we are willing to take."
GER_scattered_to_the_wind_desc:0 "Germany has been struck by a seismic political change, the reverberations of which will be felt for decades to come. The Hitler cult has been obliterated and all its traces scattered to the wind. To call this move controversial would be a gross understatement, and many Party comrades are raging against the administration's new position. Nonetheless, to linger on the mistakes of history would be a fruitless endeavour. We must avert our eyes away from the darkness of the past and instead embrace the bountiful future that awaits."
GER_hitler_acted_alone_desc:0 "Speer and his administration understand that Hitler was a flawed leader who ruled with poor judgement and enacted many amoral policies. Unfortunately for the Reich, our most stubborn Party comrades refuse to understand this, preferring to view the late Führer through rose-tinted lenses. While we cannot force the conservatives to embrace our viewpoint, it is within our power to inform the world. The truth is whatever we declare, and our truth is that Hitler acted alone in ordering atrocities. The world must believe that no one in the administration had any knowledge of Hitler's decision making, for the sake of Germany's future."
GER_a_better_light_to_stand_in_desc:0 "The German Reich stands on the precipice, bracing itself to take the leap of faith into a bright new era. We must demonstrate to the world that the current administration represents the sensible reformation of National Socialism, and that Hitler's Germany is locked away in the annals of history, never to return. By portraying Speer's administration as not only separate but morally superior to Hitler's, we may be able to form greater connections with the nations around us."
GER_a_new_reich_desc:0 "The Reich has taken a leap of faith from the shadowy darkness of the past into the light of a new day. Speer and his administration have successfully distanced themselves from the atrocities of Adolf Hitler, a man loathed by many nations across the world at large. With our open position on the late Führer clear to all, we have shown the world a new Germany with new values. The boiling anger within the Party is a threat to us all, but it may simmer down over time; the positive diplomatic consequences of our actions, however, shall last for decades to come."
GER_our_new_spitting_image_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off. As we desperately hoped, our desire to improve diplomatic relations with the wider world may soon be fulfilled. Many heads of state have praised Speer's position on Hitler to varying degrees of openness, and the foreign press we have intensively studied are producing mostly positive coverage. Even the great beast to our west, the United States of America, has responded well to Speer's administration distancing itself from Hitler, and the Republican-Democratic Party is reportedly eying our sudden surge in popularity with envy! We have presented a new face to the world, and the world likes what it sees."
GER_we_are_not_complicate_desc:0 "Germany cannot deny that many of its sons and daughters turned against Hitler. And Germany cannot deny that among them, there were some who desired his downfall and of those who believed in him.\n\nHowever, Germany must realize that one group above all has done the most to destroy everything.\n\nIt must realize that this group is the SS."
GER_in_the_mistakes_of_the_past_desc:0 "Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and the face of his infamous state of Burgundy, an artificial entity shaped out of the corpse of France and Belgium, is and was responsible for the stains which ruined Hitler's reputation.\n\nBut most of all, they are the ones who corrupted his party and his country. All the mistakes of the past are because of Himmler and his SS."
GER_fingers_pointed_at_himmler_desc:0 "Himmler is a criminal, and a trickster who wishes to take over the Reich for himself. His men too are minions we cannot forgive. We must set ourselves apart from them, and for the good of the Fatherland, we must make a decision!\n\nWe can either refuse recognition for him as part of our government, or we can start confronting him. One way or the other, we cannot let him continue to be a menace to the good future of our Fatherland!"
GER_no_compassion_for_himmler_desc:0 "The ties of our Fatherland to that traitorous pagan shall be severed. Completely cut off from us, this monster shall no longer benefit from our attention.\n\nLet him realize that we have had enough of him and of his schemes. Our Fatherland will no longer see him as one of our own.\n\nAnd with this in mind, the world will learn to let him rot."
GER_no_contact_order_desc:0 "Shorn of contact and information, the Himmlerite beasts will enjoy no help from us in creating their schemes. Thus weakened, the burgundian hydra will be easier to manage\n\This will be our way of cutting them off from us.\n\nThe Fatherland will jam their transmissions, eliminate their agents, and destroy their connections."
GER_no_mercy_for_himmler_desc:0 "Hitler made a mistake with this man. We will not make the same mistake again. Unlike our dear Führer, we will ensure that Himmler's state shall no longer see the light which comes from our Fatherland.\n\nWhile they may possess nuclear weapons, we will not be intimidated. We will seal them away, confronting them for the demons that they are."
GER_a_confrontational_policy_desc:0 "We will meet the Burgundians every step of the way; we will face these traitorous monsters down at every turn they take.\n\nGermany, our Fatherland, shall no longer tolerate inaction towards them.

But that is the price we will be happy to pay for the sake of our people."
GER_no_friends_in_the_black_state_desc:0 "Germany does not need friends in Burgundy, and Burgundy will never have any allies in Germany again. Forcing them to become friendless is our next move.\n\nThey may exist as they please, despite the hatred the world has for them, but we will make sure that their existence becomes a hell for them.\n\nIf they stand against us for what we believe, so will we oppose them for their betrayal of Germany and of National Socialism!"
GER_the_reich_stands_against_monsters_desc:0 "We will never, ever support monsters again. The Fatherland shall see to it that neither support nor sympathy nor forgiveness shall be extended to the hollow men who have sold themselves to Himmler and his Black State.\n\nNo longer are they to us the men they once were; they are nothing but evil fiends seeking to bring down what we all stand for. Against them, our people shall be!\n\nDas Vaterland toleriert keine Monster!"
GER_two_giants_together_again_desc:0 "It's evident that our new course will bring us in competition with the United States. However, we want this to be a "new" kind of struggle, one made between nations which respect each other, and fought on the field of trade and industry with clear rules and without people dying in a senseless war.\n\nIn order to bring our nations together, we shall propose to our former enemy a conference. This meeting, to be held in Toronto, will set the foundations for a rapprochement, and who knows, perhaps the end of the embargo which is slowly suffocating our economy?"
GER_turn_back_the_doomsday_clock_desc:0 "We have made a very important decision. And this should not cost us more.\n\nWe shall see to it that our nuclear arsenal is reduced, and that our capabilities shall be regulated. It is a serious compromise, indeed, but it would be one great step towards getting the Americans to become more friendly with us."
GER_more_rights_for_slaves_desc:0 "Another agreement has been made. And that concerns our former property.\n\nWhat the Americans called slaves we shall treat more kindly. And hopefully that should show to them that we are more than willing to do what is right.\n\nAfter all, that is something we wished to do too. Let's just hope they don't rub that in our faces too much."
GER_first_in_trade_desc:0 "It's a big sacrifice for anyone to let go of the first of everything they own or earn. And for our Reich, it is going to be our own sacrifice to let the Americans have a taste of the resources we now possess.\n\nSurely, while this means great reward for us, this too should mean that our new American friends will benefit."
GER_toronto_accords_desc:0 ""With the conference ended in resounding success, we can now proudly say that we have opened a new era for our two countries! The United States of America and the Grossdeutsches Reich are now bound by their own agreement to face each other in friendly and regulated competition, and to always seek out a diplomatic solution to any problem that may arise.\n\nWith the Toronto Accords, our economy will once more soar into the skies, and the German people will understand how righteous our cause was. Let this be the final gravestone on the mad dreams of those who tried to stop us!""
GER_home_of_the_brave_desc:0 "As a way to further increase our relationships with the United States, Helmuth Schmidt has proposed a tour of the East Coast, during which he will meet and fraternize with the higher echelons of the American politics and government. This should help us achieve further benefits from our new partners.\n\nThe Führer has agreed to the proposal, but with a limit. As many landmarks within the former Thirteen Colonies have a deeper meaning than their outer appearance, it would be best to avoid anything which may irk the conservatives at home, after all - he argues - we are already making sweeping reforms, and it would be unwise to force our hand when we are still recovering from a civil war..."
GER_land_of_the_free_desc:0 "As a way to further increase our relationships with the United States, Helmuth Schmidt has proposed a tour of the East Coast, during which he will meet and fraternize with the higher echelons of the American politics and government. This should help us achieve further benefits from our new partners.\n\nIn the end, the Führer has agreed to this proposal, and has allowed the Minister to visit all landmarks he desires as long as the Amerikaner agree. While this is sure to spark controversies in the Reich, as Schmidt will surely visit sites linked with the slaves' struggle for freedom, in the end our leader preferred to keep the Gang of Four content."
GER_that_grand_old_republic_desc:0 "As agreed upon, Reichsminister Schmidt has begun his tour of the most important landmarks in the East Coast, starting from Washington DC itself. However, he'll refrain from visiting monuments dedicated to happenings and people which would stand in stark contrast to what we are still doing within our homeland.\n\nAs such, while visits to the Capitol and the White House, as well as the Pentagon are scheduled, he will stay clear of the Lincoln memorial and the commemorative plaques to those who died "to free the slaves". This may not sit well with his reformist spirit, but until we have fully abolished slavery, it would be rather controversial to be showed next to Lincoln's statue..."
GER_this_old_house_desc:0 "Finally, the great moment has come. After a formal dinner held at the White House, our Minister will sign the treaty which fully lifts the embargo, and officially inaugurate this new age of cooperation between our two countries.\n\nIn the following talks, we expect new trade deals to be signed, which will be a boon for our economy, and further aid us in rebuilding our country from the destruction of the civil war"
GER_a_house_divided_desc:0 "As expected, Reichsminister Schmidt visited Lincoln's Memorial and has been photographed proudly shaking hands with reform-aligned liberals of the American political sphere. While his views on the current policies undertaken by the Reich is known by everyone, turning the international stage into a megaphone for his personal ideals will surely have consequences.\n\nStill, one can't deny that this has further pleased the government of the United States, as its people now see Germany as a place striving to grant freedom to everyone. However, it remains to see whether such hopes will become reality..."
GER_a_strange_meeting_desc:0 "Finally, after all our efforts to woo the Americans, a German diplomat will meet with the President of the United States. It's been a long road to this point, full of trials and torment, but we are here, and that's what matters now. The diplomat in charge of this historic meeting is Helmut Schmidt, the Reichs best man for the job. If the meeting goes as planned, the President and Schmidt will sign a treaty that will bring about a new age upon the world, one of peace and economic stability."
GER_future_perfect_desc:0 "At the end of the civil war, the Reich was the laughing stock of the world, a textbook case of what happens to an empire built upon war, exploitation of the weak and isolationism. Now, this has changed, and our country is at the forefront of international cooperation, the embargo which has strangled our economy is no more, and we enter the world stage with our head held high.\n\nThanks to Schmidt's work, and despite his sometimes "extreme" views, our economy can finally flourish, as our ports fill with ships from foreign lands and our industries sell their goods to the entire world! This is the new Grossdeutsches Reich, a prosperous land, filled with opportunities! A country respected inside and outside by all! An empire upon which the sun of National Socialism shall never set!"
GER_our_acquaintances_from_across_the_sea_desc:0 "Despite focusing our efforts on our relationship with the Empire of the Rising Sun, we should still keep all doors open. The United States would still be a good trade partner, if we managed to convince them to lift, at least partially, their embargo. However, this probably won't come for free, the Amerikaner are "the land of the free" and will surely ask for proof that we are truly different from the likes of Goering and Heydrich.\n\nIn order to improve our relationships with the United States, we shall send Reichsminister Schmist on a good-will tour in the States. His charm and his well-known reformist views will ease the way towards a treaty, if not of friendship, at least of reciprocate acceptance."
GER_the_preptual_long_night_desc:0 "The United States asks for "reassurances" about our good will? Of course, we'll give them as many as they ask for! Words are cheap, and can be expended freely without any cost; actions, on the other hand, are a different matter entirely...\n\nWe won't bow to the Amerikaner! We didn't kneel during the war, and we surely won't do it now that we are retaking our legitimate place among the world powers! They'll have their precious "words" if they so desire, but that's what they will remain. Words. Like a perpetual night never making way for the dawn, we shall forever oppose our opponents and their false "freedom" they are so proud of!"
GER_a_new_dawn_desc:0 "Despite our wishes and dreams, we simply can't make the same mistakes all over again. The Four have pointed out a strategy that, in the long run, will bring the Reich back on its feet, and for now, the only sensible choice is to follow it, the people of both Germany and the United States desire a change in course, and we can't deny that granting them such change would be much better than opposing it.\n\nIn order to improve our international standing and tap into new sources of international trade, we will enact a moderate amount of true reforms aimed at spreading a bit of "freedom" throughout Germany. We can only hope this turns out to be a new dawn for the Vaterland, rather than a return to the night..."
GER_moonlighting_desc:0 "Even the night has its own light. Just as the moon shines from the darkness, we shall grant the Amerikaner a bit of what they desire, new laws will be passed granting "freedom" to the people, but behind the letter of the law, there will be a sea of exceptions and secondary legislation which de facto voids our reforms of any real meaning.\n\nLying through the teeth is humiliating indeed, but we won't be subservient to the United States of America, and if a screen of illusions is what we need to make them treat us better, then this is what they shall have!"
GER_broken_promises_desc:0 "The time has come to keep our promises. Did we truly make any promise, though? Did the Amerikaner think a nation as great as ours, as great as the Reich, would submit to the decadent, reactionary democracies which lost the last war due to their own weakness and cowardice?!\n\nTo the furnace with their promises! The scraps of paper they brought us as "proof" of their pretenses will be much-needed fuel for the new Germany we are building! Let the inferiors shout at our "lies" as they lick their wounded pride, but we do not lie, because the words of the strongest always ring true regardless of their content!"
GER_broken_hearts_desc:0 "Many in Europe hoped that we would become a beacon of liberalism, of freedom, of equality. Today, we make it clear that we won't lower ourselves to their level, after all, our ideology has been born out of the delusion towards such a flawed system as liberalism.n\n\nEquality and freedom have brought the so-called great powers of the last century to their end, and we surely won't follow in their footsteps! Let their frail hearts break, for our own have been reforged in iron to take the pain of the civil war, the Reich needs only dedication, and we already have that in large amounts!"
GER_a_new_sheriff_in_town_desc:0 "With their victory over the conservatives, the Gang of Four have proved their strength and their ability to influence the Führer's decisions. Even though Albert Speer is independent in his action, he has de facto accepted to let Schmidt oversee his diplomatic approaches towards the United States, granting him almost total freedom of actions.\n\nThere's a new sheriff in town, or four to be precise. They now dictate law within the Reich, and those who stand in their way will face the consequences of their hybris."
GER_a_new_way_desc:0 "The Four, each in their own field of expertise, are the embodiment of a new way to conceive the Reich. Be it in the economy, in the army, in the diplomacy or in the political field, they advocate for meritocracy, expanded freedom and the abolition of all forms of exploitation, be they conscription, slavery or puppetting foreign countries.\n\nThis new way of theirs offers a new hope to many who have lost their own, and is perhaps the only thing keeping the poor and the downtrodden from taking up arms for their freedom. Our government understands the need for such changes, despite their being in conflict with the official doctrine of national socialism, and will ensure their implementation."
GER_a_better_way_desc:0 "The reforms proposed by the Gang of Four are, in their opinion, better than what traditional national socialism offers. They are more efficient and will bring prosperity to the people in an unprecedented way. More than anything else, this prosperity will be built with our own efforts rather than by exploiting others, this will ensure that no one will hate us for what we shall do from now on.\n\nIs it truly possible to build a better Reich? Is it truly possible to build a new Germany where everyone is happy and no one is left behind or brutally forced into submission? Perhaps it is indeed possible, perhaps it isn't, but one thing is true, what we believed in failed once, and maybe, but just maybe, giving these new ideas a chance wouldn't hurt, would it?"
GER_copenhagen_accords_desc:0 "With the National Progressive Party in power in the United States, we can bring them much closer to us. We shall invite their leadership to a diplomatic conference in Copenhagen, therefore on somewhat neutral ground, and propose them a deal to let go of the past grievances and start a new, more cooperative relationship.\n\nDespite our current hostility, no one has anything to gain from the continuation of the embargo, and this is something even the American hardliners realize. The Copenhagen Accords will bring us a bit closer, and pave the way towards a mutual acceptance and, who knows, perhaps a friendly enmity?"
GER_the_american_question_desc:0 "With the Republican-Democrats in power, the United States have taken a decisively hostile attitude towards us. If we truly want to achieve a breakthrough we'll need to work hard for it. The only question is how much we are willing to pay...\n\nOf course, Reichsminister Schmidt presses for larger concessions, but even the Führer, despite his reluctance to "humiliate Germany" as he calls it, understands the need for an end to the embargo. However, he may veto the entire operation should the Amerikaner ask for too much."
GER_the_right_approach_desc:0 "Our preliminary talks have yielded only partial results. While the Americans have accepted to partially lift their embargo on our economy, they also handed us a detailed list of reforms they want to see done, before we can start discussing any kind of diplomatic thaw or, even worse, economic cooperation, this will surely enrage the conservatives throughout the Reich.\n\nOf course, our Führer didn't take the news well at all. Right now, he and Reichsminister Schmidt are discussing - or, to be more precise, arguing - in the Reichskanzlei, and only one can prevail. Though our leader indeed has the power to impose his will upon his minister, doing so would not only mean keeping the embargo as it is, but also antagonizing Schmidt, something which could have dire consequences on the long run for the Reich's diplomatic effort"
GER_a_lesson_in_morality_desc:0 "It seems that, in the end, Schmidt managed to convince the Führer to accept his proposal. Even though what the Amerikaner are asking for is almost an act of submission, we truly are in no position to force our will upon a superior opponent, and even though Speer still vehemently opposes such a move, he has understood that there is no alternative, either we accept what the Amerikaner proposed, or the embargo remains.\n\nWith this victory, the Gang of Four has achieved a decisive victory against the conservatives within the government, and even though our leader will still have to agree to the proposal soon to be submitted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, few think he'll refuse his imprimatur"
GER_our_changed_ways_desc:0 "In order to convince the Amerikaner of the reforms we have achieved so far, we'll show them how much we have changed from the final days of Hitler's reign. From a corrupt and inefficient government where our great, yet senile leader was used by a cohort of sycophants and their manipules of fanatics and extremists, we have become a beacon of hope for the German people, we no longer oppress our own kin, but are instead trying to bring forth a new age of enlightenment throughout the Reich!"
GER_slave_rights_are_human_rights_desc:0 "While it is true that we still have to fully abolish slavery, we are setting up the stage for the final liberation of the millions of poor souls forced to work in our mines, fields and factories. Not only have we greatly improved their living conditions, we are forbidding their abuse and heavily punishing those who harm them without reason. However, we still need time to prepare our economy to the shock that will be the sudden disappearance of what, until now, has been the staple of our productive system.\n\nThe Amerikaner will surely see the good in our reforms, and if they don't, then may we cordially remind them of their own problems with the black population?"
GER_men_at_work_desc:0 "Finally, a breakthrough!

Incredibly, with us loosening our sanctions with Japan, this has lead to an increase in the standard of living, and, even if we're interacting with a superpower that was previously almost hostile about us, no clique in the NSDAP seems to be against the progress that we are making.\n\nBusiness is booming!"

German goods are craved in Tokyo and the other metropolises of Japan, as well as abroad in the Co-Prosperity Sphere as a whole. We must make a choice - and there are two ways to go about this.\n\nThe first is to assure the Americans that this will be a nominal decrease in sanctions. After all, we first decided to venture into Capitol Hill and be friends with the U.S. No need to risk looking like we're stabbing them in the back. The second is to make the Americans listen to reason. Everyone can benefit from trading with each other, and there's no reason we cannot trade with the Japanese just as well as we can with the Americans. This will displease the U.S government and make us seem somewhat aloof - but, nothing ventured, nothing gained, no?"

 SGR_the_sword_has_fallen_desc:0 "Out of nowhere, our administration has been completely blindsided by a slave uprising not seen in our Reich's history. Led by left wing students and revolutionaries, the Reichsbanner has torn a bloody gash down Eastern Europe, splitting the Reich in two.\n\nOn our side, the Gang and Speer enter into their final split on policy, the Gang pulling one way while the Fuhrer pulls the other. Helmut Schmidt, leading the charge to agree to the slave demands, clashes directly with Albert Speer's own call to accept only the bare minimum, nothing more, and force them back into the fold. The Reichstag cracks in confusion and chaos, and the Reich lies helpless to respond.\n\nIn the East, Ferdinand Schorner has committed his final betrayal, splitting from the Reich with the promise to march west, crush the slaves, and complete his return as a hero to Germany. If the revolt is not dealt with before his invasion begins, our plans are surely doomed.\n\nThis very well could be the moment that decides Speer's Reich. Whether he maintains control or not, this is an event that will ring through all of European history forevermore. It is crucial that we do not fail."
 SGR_restoring_trust_desc:0 "Our situation is beginning to look grim. Civil agitation through our country is starting to boil over; continues dissatisfaction and dissent has eroded trust with our administration to a dangerous new low. If this trend continues, we will more than likely have a disaster on our hands.\n\n We need to restore trust in our government at once! Make promises, give the people benefits; whatever we must do! We just need to restore a little faith in our administration."
 SGR_extend_the_olive_branch_desc:0 "Many of the folks marching in protest are civil, understanding, upstanding citizens of Germany, through and through. They aren't out to destroy the country; they merely want their voices to be heard. We should let these folks know that we really are listening; sitting down with the leaders of these marches and movements will communicate that we are reasonable, and all on the same side. We're all working for a better future for Germany."
 SGR_clear_the_trenches_desc:0 "Those who can discuss their grievances with us and a peaceful and civil manner are not the issue. Even the people who gather peacefully are not the root of our problems. It is the loud-mouths; those rabble-rousers who preach immedient, radical change and those that vandalize and riot! They are the issue. We need to make a list, check it twice, and round up the most vocal and violent of these 'protesters' so we can have a return to normalcy."
 SGR_reichspolizeigesetz_desc:0 "One of the core issues that has led us to where we are today is our use of our unified police, the Oporo. If we are going to convince the people that we are genuinely trying to reform, we need to address their complaints about our use of the police.\n\n Therefore, we will reform the Orpo into the Reichspolizei. This will be a fresh, clean start for our police agents. By being more transparent and sticking to newly written procedures, which will respect the rights of German citizens, we should be able to address one of the people's core problems with our administration."
 SGR_a_centralized_apparatus_desc:0 "The Oporo had the right idea; a centralized police force across our nation, headed by the Federal Government is the most efficient and effective way to police our nation.\n\n Many of our citizens don't like this approach. Part of the reason they are marching is to let them have more of a say over such matters. If this chaos has shown us anything, it has shown that we can not trust local governments or the people with such an institution. The Federal is in the right here."
 SGR_local_independence_desc:0 "Centralized police forces are causing a lot of friction all throughout Germany. Our direct oversight with the country's forces has upset most of our population one way or another. Many folks believe that they should have some say in who becomes chiefs of police, or who is allowed into the force. The people want more locals in their force as well; they wonder why we won't let them have a part in this process.\n\n Although handing over policing to the locals through our country will decrease our overall power projection, it may be a necessary evil we need to live with. A more hands off approach, akin to the police structure of the 1930s would put us in the good graces of many of our people."
 SGR_reichsschutzgruppe_desc:0 "Experience has taught us that we need a highly mobile, well trained and heavily armed police unit to deal with dangerous situations that the average policeman isn't ready to deal with.\n\n We will put them under a regiment that would make an army man blush. These chosen few will be the cream of the crop of our police forces, trained in urban combat, close quarters combat, negotiation, hostage situations, and more."
 SGR_salvaging_the_economy_desc:0 "The global Oil Crisis has crippled our economy, and that's putting it lightly. We can not just continue without some sort of plan of action; we need to decide, and quickly, what our next course of action will be. We need to be quick and decisive if we are going to salvage what remains of our economy."
 SGR_all_the_money_in_the_world_desc:0 "Some within our administration have suggested that the first steps on the road to recover would be to strictly ration our oil until global prices lower and stabilize. These men are, of course, wrong.\n\n Rationing petroleum would be detrimental to our economy. We can simply not afford to place limits on how much fuel a person or company can buy; the results would be devastating to our already hurt economy. Although it will cost us a great deal, the monetary costs will be worth it in the long run."
 SGR_strict_oil_rationing_desc:0 "Some of the more liberal leaning members of our country have proposed that the government should subsidize purchasing oil off the global market to keep meeting our demands. These bureaucrats are totally insane!\n\n The cost of oil on the market is astronomical and outrageous! Our country would likely bankrupt itself if we attempted to subsidize  our current levels of consumption; we simply don't have the capital to do this. We must instead resort to rationing; it will hurt our economy in the short term, but it is a better solution than destroying our economic future with such a heavy burden on our shoulders."
 SGR_energiesicherungsgesetz_desc:0 "By passing this bill, the Energy Insurance Act will guarantee that the other members of our economic pact will have access to affordable petroleum.\n\n This is going to cost us; it won't be cheap to subsidize this fuel, but oil is absolutely vital to not only our own economy, but to all of the members in our economic sphere. If we are going to keep our economic pact together, than we must act."
 SGR_open_ports_desc:0 "It's time to fully commit to free trade. Doubling down on autarky will only hamper our economy. If we want recovery and growth, we need to encourage it! Stimulating global trade is the only way we will ever get the price of oil back to normal; not by doubling down on shutting down our foriegn trade!"
 SGR_memories_of_autarky_desc:0 "Self dependence is truly the only way forward. Hitler wasn't right on many issues, but his vision was spot on in one regard; a strong, healthy Germany is one that relies on itself and no one else!\n\n Buying petroleum on the global market is what got us to this point in the first place! Why, then, would we double down and essentially gamble by throwing more money into foriegn oil? It's madness, plain and simple. Germany must come first; we must relearn from the past and become self-dependent."
 SGR_the_plan_going_forward_desc:0 "Ludwig Erhard is nothing short of a genius. Without his feverous laboring and planning, our economy would be half of what it is today; our miraculous growth is a testament to his brilliance.\n\n Erhard's economics is also what is currently killing the economy that we've worked so hard to build up since our Civil War. It is clear that we need to change course and come up with some kind of solution. The question is; what do we do? What changes now?"
 SGR_the_dream_come_true_fash_desc:0 "It is done. After years of wrestling with the Gang over the future of the Reich- and, by extension, Europe- the Fuhrer has finally broken free of their restrictions. No more demands, no more reforms, no more whining- Speer has gotten his way, and nobody will stop him again.\n\nThey all tried so hard to rip the Reich to pieces, crying about the systems that kept it in power, scrabbling to tear apart the very structures that had elevated Germany to the status of world superpower with their liberal fantasies. Speer allowed them to grow complacent, thinking he was passive, and at the very moment when they thought their victory was complete- the slave revolt- he turned the tables.\n\nNow, Speer is alone at the top, with nobody to hold him back. All he needs now is to put the finishing touches on his masterpiece. Greater than the war economy, greater than the Volkshalle- this is how Speer will be remembered for all history."
 SGR_restoring_party_unity_desc:0 "The last decade has not been kind to the NSDAP. First, the Burgerkrieg tore the party to shreds, violently ripping the wings off of the German Eagle. Then, when Speer emerged victorious, the Party once again split- reactionaries attempting to undo every change Speer proposed on one side, dissenters who wished to bend to the capitalist's beck and call on the other. The reforms of the Gang have only exacerbated this problem, and the Slave Revolt nearly shattered the party altogether. Urgent action is needed to stop this.\n\nIf Schmidt and his gang was in control, they would undoubtedly take action to break the party up. We are not the Gang. We will do whatever is necessary to unite the party behind Speer, and only Speer. Germany will not fail again."
 SGR_enforcing_government_unity_desc:0 "The Gang has been a roadblock in the way of real progress ever since Speer gained power. They constantly have tried to push the bar further and further, well beyond the bounds of common sense and reason. As long as we have been in power, they have done their utmost to stymie Speer's efforts to create a Reich that both works without betraying what makes it the Reich. This cannot remain the case.\n\nThese men- Erhard, Schmidt, Kiesinger, and Tresckow- have long outlived their usefulness. They shall be given a choice- bow to the party line, or get out of the way. Whether their sense or their beliefs will prevail remains a mystery, but one way or another, Speer will not be challenged."
 SGR_gleichschaltung_forevermore_desc:0 "Due to the Gang's traitorous behavior, the idea of a Reich with free democracy has become an increasingly popular idea among the youth. These rebellious knaves are the same as the ones Speer used to take power all those years ago- still as rebellious, still as foolish, still as blinded by their goggles as they were in 1963. Their delusions will not be coddled- no, accepted- any longer.\n\nThere is one party, there is one Fuhrer, and there is one Reich. This is not a democracy. This is not a nation which will bend over backwards for Judeo-Bolsheviks and western pigs alike. We are Germany! We have stood as the power of Europe for years before, and with Speer's well placed reforms, we shall stand as the power of Europe for the rest of time!"
 SGR_ein_volk_desc:0 "The youth, as they have been for the last decade, are unhappy with Speer's way of doing things. Apparently, they thought that the Fuhrer was pleased to give in to the Gang's fantasies. As is tradition, they've decided to raise hell. This time, however, will be different.\n\nThe government no longer cares for these brats. Let them scream as long as they like. The people, by and large, will be behind the Fuhrer. National Socialism is the path forward for Germany, and it would do our people much good to remember that. Every good German man will be proud to call himself a Nazi. They shall wear the swastika with pride, and Germany will turn back towards its bright future."
 SGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "What is a Slav? A man? A human being, living and breathing, as we Aryans do? Or nothing more than an Untermensch, no more worthy than a good dog or abnormally productive than a cow? Schmidt and his gang may argue the former, but any good Aryan knows the truth. The Slav- and by extension, Eastern Europe- serves no purpose other than to serve the Aryan man. They are not slaves because we care for them, they are not slaves because the slave system only served to hinder Germany. It would be prudent to remind our people of this.\n\nUntil the Slav proves that he can lead himself into the future  rather than drag the rest of Europe down- something which seems quite unlikely- the Reich will take the lead in this endeavor. Even if we must take them kicking and screaming, we will take them, and they will work for a Europe free of the stain of Judeo-Bolshevism."
 SGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Germany is safe from western influence and bolshevik thought alike- for now. The battle, of course, is not yet finished. The sharks of liberalism and communism still circle the waters surrounding our boat, itching for the moment they believe they can strike. With the Gang at the helm, they very nearly had their chance.\n\nThe captain has reasserted his command. Albert Speer is ready to lead Germany into the future it truly deserves- one not of subservience to the Slav, or the Jew, or the capitalist, but one of leadership and power. A world in which the Reich once again dominates, a world in which the National Socialist dream can come true. The challenges on this path may be many, but we shall weather the storm, secure in our knowledge that National Socialism will keep us safe through the raging waters, now and forevermore."
 SGR_the_dream_come_true_auth_desc:0 "The impossible has happened. Helmut Schmidt has won out. In the greatest game of geopolitical cards ever played, Speer and Schmidt have dueled on the world stage, and Schmidt has emerged victorious-bloodied, battered, and bruised, but unquestionably victorious.With his negotiations with the Revolt a total success, and the Reich bent irreversibly towards the Gang's way of thinking, there seems to be no direction but up for the German reformists.\n\nWhere does Germany go from here? Who knows? Never before has so much power in the Reich been held in the hands of men like Schmidt, Erhard, Kiesinger, and Tresckow. With Speer relegated to figurehead status, the future has been blown wide open for a gentler, understanding, democratic Reich- one ready to finally ditch its dark past for the glory of the modern world.\n\nOne thing is certain - if the citizens of Germany thought that they'd seen an incredible amount of reform before, they haven't seen anything yet."
 SGR_the_house_of_cards_falls_desc:0 "The NSDAP has never been a particularly stable party, but the last years have been especially chaotic, even by their standards. Though the level of discontent is obviously nowhere near the levels seen on the verge of the Burgerkrieg, it is an undeniable fact that the party is splintering once again- the Dissenters are finally beginning to fully split from the Reformist and Reactionary wings of the party. If Speer was in charge, this would be an unmitigated disaster- one to be solved with extreme prejudice.\n\nHowever, Speer is not in charge. It more than suits our interests for the party to split- if anything, it would do us much good to hasten the breakup. The sooner the old party bureaucracy is out of the way, the better."
 SGR_the_shadow_government_desc:0 "In all but name, the Gang of Four controls the reins of power in Germany. Speer's role has been crushed down to only the most ceremonial duties, a mere figurehead to the powers behind the scenes. However, Albert Speer is still the Fuhrer. It is theoretically possible that he could stage a return to power- something he is undoubtedly plotting, giving the more than negative nature of the Gang's takeover.\n\nIn order to cut him off before he even gets the chance to try and return, we shall strengthen our position with important members of the Reich's bureaucracy that hold similar ideals as we do. If we are able to dominate the upper levels of government with men who dislike Albert Speer as much as the Gang, there will be no danger of him ever returning to real prominence."
 SGR_contact_popular_movements_desc:0 "The Gang's solidification of power is not merely contained to the inner Party bureaucracy. Outside of the Party, the shift in the Reich's policy has drawn all sort of dissenter's interests, seemingly intrigued by this new course that the Gang has set out. These dissenters, along with the previously mentioned allies in the upper ranks of the Reich, may be able to provide valuable legitimacy and credible ideas.\n\nAs such, a semi-formal conference has been scheduled to take place in Frankfurt, the center of movements for German democracy since the 1800's. With numerous big names invited to appear, this conference may set the course for the next stage of the Reich. It is for the best that we prepare."
 SGR_einigkeit_desc:0 "There's no easy way to put it- the Reich is dying. The systems that the German people have known and trusted for decades, despite their cruel, oppressive natures, are finally being torn down. Such a rapid shift, even after the years of reform instituted before the Slave Revolt, has thrown the people into a river of change without the knowledge of how to swim. They are scared, confused, and alone- something that we cannot allow to become the national mood, lest a tide of reactionary sentiment sweep us back out the door.\n\nWe shall be the angels to these shepherds, taking their hands and leading them in a unified, caring front into the future, past the gruesome history we've worked so hard to get away from. We shall take them to our own Bethlehem, where finally, a free Germany awaits us, and they will not be afraid. A new era is nearly at hand, and it is our duty to bring the German people to it."
 SGR_recht_desc:0 "The German people have been deprived of many, many things since 1933, but perhaps the most important one is justice. For decades, Nazi officials have gotten away with some of the most heinous crimes possible. Corruption, treason, murder, a thousand other acts that would put any average citizen in a penal labor camp for the rest of their days- all waved away, simply because of the armband these men proudly wore. Now, it is time to turn the tables on them.\n\nPerhaps it is poetic that many of the most important figures that stand in the way of freedom and democracy are blatant criminals. One could certainly find meaning in that. However, we are not looking for poetic metaphors- we are looking for the hand of the law to finally come crashing down on these traitor's heads. The judge's gavel will be the primary weapon of our new legal war, and these men will face justice for the acts that they have committed against so many."
 SGR_freiheit_desc:0 "Freedom is a long and bloody road, especially for a nation with autocracy as baked into its culture as Germany. The German people are used to having a strongman, whether Hitler or Speer, direct their nations for them, crush their freedoms in the name of their supposed "safety" or "self-interest". These were all fascist lies, and now the chance has come to cut the cancer out and replace it with a free, democratic Reich.\n\nIt will not be perfect- Lord knows how many times Erhard, Schmidt, Kiesinger, and Tresckow have erred. There will be rough patches, as there always are. Sacrifices will need to be made. It will not be an easy road away from the siren of fascism, but the light at the end of the tunnel- a Germany where all are free and equal, no longer forced to fear their government- is enough to keep the Gang toiling. They will toil until they drop, or until their dream is achieved.\n\nThere is much work to be done, and the Gang is ready to do it."
 SGR_a_new_era_desc:0 "Germany is undergoing yet another visible change; one of many that its already experienced this century.\n\n The Oil Crisis, combined with the great Slave Revolt has shown us that our our model of governance is outdated. Germany is running its nation and aligned partners like the great powers of the Victorian Era ran their personal spheres of influence. Our model is hopelessly outdated.\n\n The last two back to back crisis has proved without a doubt that we can not simply ignore the rest of the world. Like it or not, but if we are to retain our status as an influential and great power, we need to be able to work with others; not as a superior or overlord, but as equals. International cooperation is the way forwards."
 SGR_an_example_in_the_west_desc:0 "The Americans have something going for them with the OFN. Although the member nations of that organization are little more than the United State's pawns, their organization and willingness to cooperate with each other is unparalleled when compared to our Pakt or Japan's Sphere. While their alliance is nowhere near perfect, there are many lessons to be learned by observing them and how they interact with each other."
 SGR_time_for_change_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis definitely has had a lasting effect on the global market. Nations seem to be more hesitant in their overseas purchases, which is making relations and connections with foriegn interests more important than ever. If Germany is going to move into the future, then we need to adapt if we wish to remain relevant as a world power."
 SGR_a_hint_in_the_east_desc:0 "The Japanese are the perfect example of a crumbling, decaying empire.\n\n Their gold age, if one can even call their exploitation of Asia 'golden' has long since passed. The Japanese government is decaying, and their army and navy only keeps their Sphere together thanks to their impressive firepower.\n\n The Japanese compose themselves like a bunch of thugs. They are the perfect enemy for the world to unite against. Not since the 30s has such a prime target offered itself to be the world's boogie man, and for once, it's not us."
 SGR_prime_the_ambassadors_desc:0 "It is time to unveil our new foriegn policy to the world. We will release a statement to all of our diplomats overseas; the time of German isolation has ended.\n\n The future of Germany, and by extension, the world, relies on cooperation. It's time to make our ambassadors prove their worth; their mission?\n\n The mission is surprisingly simple. Their mission is to do their jobs; its time to build relations with the nations of the world."
 SGR_collect_the_proposals_desc:0 "Already, our brightest minds are hard at work drafting proposals for the formation of a new council that all nations of the world can sit in on. Dozens upon dozens of names alone are floating around in our Forigen Affair office, as well as more than a few ideas about what the structure of such an organization will look like.\n\n Inspiration from the League of Nations, the short lived "United Nations" and other historic suggestions is evident in many of these proposals. While most of the ideas are just that; proposals, it's exciting to see how eager and motivated not only our people, but foreigners are to create another international organization!"
 SGR_koalition_der_nationen_desc:0 "The Coalition of Nations; that will be the name of the New World Order. It's not a mere novel idea; practical experiences from the League of Nations and United Nations have been taken to help us create this new organization, or 'Koalition.'\n\n Different boards for maxim flexibility, a pathway to membership, a parliament, and much, much more! Although in its infancy on paper, the idea has many people in our administration hopeful for the future. It's time to test the waters and let the Japanese and Americans in on our plans. As the next two largest superpowers, their input and support will be vital to making this dream a reality."

 speer.1.desc:0 "오늘 라이히슈타크의 계단에서, 슈페어는 자신이 독일 총통으로써의 자리를 마침내 지켜냈음을 선언했습니다. 게르마니아까지 슈페어를 호위한 슈타우펜베르크의 제6 전차사단의 병사들과 수백명의 무장 민병대가 독일국의 새로운 지도자를 둘러쌌고, 슈페어는 자신이 독일에 번영과 계몽으로 가득 찬 새로운 시대를 가져오겠다고 선언했습니다. \n\n 수백 수천 명의 사람들이 새로운 지도자의 등극과 독일이 여지껏 휘말렸던 가장 피비린내 나는 전쟁이 끝난 것을 축하하며 온 도로를 가득 채우는 동안, 여전히 나라 곳곳에서는 소규모 접전이 지속되고 있습니다. 슈페어의 적들은 패배했음에도 불구하고, 항복을 거부하며 슈페어를 차기 지도자로 인정하지 않고 있습니다. 하지만, 슈페어의 연설은 독일에서만 찬사를 받은 것이 아닙니다. 국내에서 엄청난 반응을 얻으며, 수십 년 만에 가장 높은 시청률을 기록한 방송이 되었기 때문입니다. \n\n "강한 독일이라는 꿈을 꾸는 것으로는 충분치 않습니다. 우리는 강한 독일을 믿어야 합니다. 우리는 강한 독일을 얻고자 분투해야 합니다. 우리는 어둠 속에서 불을 밝혀, 우리의 자손들을 위한 불빛이 되어, 우리를 그들에게 강하고, 용감하고, 아름다운 새로운 세상을 물려주었던 자들로 기억하게 할 것입니다.""

SS는 아마 광범위한 혐오를 받고 있겠지만, 하이드리히는 서러시아 전쟁 이후로 긍정적인 이미지를 유지해왔습니다. 이는 그의 결단력과 스파르타적인 규울에 대해 히틀러가 높은 평가를 내렸기 때문입니다. 분명히, 그에 대한 존경은 힘러에 대한 존경으로 빠르게 변화할 것입니다. 그리고 우리는 독일에 부르군트주의를 추종하는 배반자를 허용할 수 없습니다. 여전히 사람들의 마음 속에 전쟁에 대한 기억이 살아있을 때 그의 행적을 노출시키는 것은 SS에 친화적인 감정을 영원히 무너뜨릴 수 있을 것입니다. \n\n 어떤 인간을 역사의 저편으로 보내버려야 할까요?"

"그래, 나도 알고있네. 하지만...일본은 여전히 미국에 견줄 만한 군사력을 가지고 있지 않은가. 그로써 전쟁 억제 능력을 확보할 수는 없겠나?" \n\n "전쟁억제라뇨? 총통 각하, 무례를 용서하십시오. 하지만 우리는 이미 그것을 확보하고 있습니다. 우리에겐 핵무기가 있지 않습니까. 그들이 사용하는 재래식 무기는 아무런 영향력도 가지고 있지 않습니다. 저를 믿어주십시오. 에르하르트가 옳습니다. 미국과의 교역으로 얻을 경제적 이익은 일본이 우리에게 줄 수 있는 그 어떤 것보다 훨씬 더 중요할 것입니다. 그리고 일본과 연합을 하여 미국이 우리와 다시 적대 관계로 돌아서게 해서는 안됩니다." \n\n "나는 이미 결정을 내렸네, 슈미트." 슈페어는 조금 안심하며 말했다. "너무 초조해하지 말게. 외무부에 있는 자네 부하 직원에게 임무에 착수하고, 에르하르트에게 연락하라고 전달하게. 아우토반에서 포드 자동차가 다니는 것을 보려면 아직 갈 길이 멀어.""

"총통 각하, 일본은 우리에게 줄 것이 아무것도 없습니다. 미국은 우리 경제에 이익을 가져다줄 훨씬 많은 것을 가지고 있습니다." \n\n 슈페어는 오랫동안 답하지 않았다. 그는 책상에서 일어나 창문 너머를 바라보며, 수십 년 전 자신이 설계했던 게르마니아의 마천루들을 살폈다. "나도 알고 있네, 슈미트." 슈페어는 슈미트를 돌아도보지 않은 채 나지막이 말했다. "그런데 나는 경제에는 큰 생각을 두지 않고 있네. 미국은 무역 협상을 몇 번 했다고 해서 우리를 향한 은밀한 활동들을 멈추지 않을 걸세. 우리는 군사적인 평행추 역할을 해줄 자가 필요해." \n\n 슈미트는 씩씩대며 말했다. 그가 벌떡 일어나며 의자는 깨끗이 닦인 바닥을 긁었고, 그 소리는 총통의 귀에 그대로 꽂혔다. "우리는 북아메리카를 포함하여 그 모든 도시들을 초토화시킬 수 있는 핵무기를 가지고 있습니다! 일본의 핵무기를 추가한다고해서 세계적 긴장 상황을 경감해주지는 못할 것입니다. 슈페어!" \n\n 총통은 자신의 이름을 듣자 한순간에 분노로 휩싸여 얼굴을 붉혔다. "나는 결정을 내렸네, 슈미트. 그리고 자네는 순방을 다녀오면 되는거야. 우리는 미국과 정상 관계를 수립할 수 있네. 그런데...자네가 생각하고 있는 방식으로는 아니야." 그는 뒤돌아 슈미트의 얼굴을 바라보았다. 슈미트는 떨고 있음을 숨기기 위해 등 뒤로 손을 돌리고 있었다. "대화는 이 정도로 하지. 슈미트. 나가보게." \n\n 외무장관은 뒤돌아 경례도 하지 않은채 슈페어의 사무실을 빠져나왔다. 바라건대, 언젠가 슈미트가 일본에의 접근이 얼마나 지혜로운 일이었는지 알기 바란다."

"그래, 게렌." 슈페어는 두 팔을 벌리며 말했다. "이 모든 정보가 자네가 나에게 가져다 준 것임은 잘 알고 있었네. 자네에게 국내 치안 문제를 어떻게 처리할지에 대해 아이디어가 있다고 하더군. 부디 생각을 털어놔주게." \n\n 게렌은 잠시동안 주저하더니, 역력히 안심한 듯했고 책상에 몸을 기댔다. "총통 각하. 조금 무례한 말일지 모르겠습니다만, 각하께서 게슈타포와 해외방첩청에 고삐를 죄려한다는 것은 정보기관들에서 비밀도 아닙니다. 사실, 그들은 상태가 심각합니다. 그들은 전쟁을 막지도 못할 뿐더러, 독일국 내의 반체제 인사들을 제압하지도 못합니다." \n\n 슈페어의 표정은 여전히 헤아리기 어려웠다. "계속 하게." "전쟁이 끝난 후에, 미국은 방향을 바꾸었습니다. 전시에만 운영되던 OSS는 CIA가 되었습니다. 그들은 실수로부터 교훈을 얻었고, 그에 부응하여 적응했으며, 이제는 첩보 부문에서 우리를 크게 앞서고 있습니다. 같은 일이 이등국가 일본을 상대로도 벌어지고 있습니다. 우리에겐 해결책이 필요합니다. 새로운 시대에 적합한 새로운 첩보부 말입니다." \n\n 슈페어는 잠시동안 이에 대해 곰곰히 생각했다. "흥미로운 생각이구만. 자네 좀 더 구체화된 생각을 가지고 있는건가?" \n\n 게렌은 고개를 끄덕였다. 그는 책상에 서류가방을 올리고 가방을 툭 쳐서 열었다. 그러고는 두툼한 서류더미 하나를 내려놓았다. 앞면에는 '국가정보원'이 휘갈겨 쓰여있었다. "여기 있습니다. 총통 각하. 자세히 알고 싶으십니까?""

IG 파르벤 회장과 달리, 장관은 이상을 추구했다. 이 점이 둘의 차이였다. \n\n "당신에게 IG 파르벤의 해체가 임박했음을 고지하고자 불렀소. IG 파르벤은 여러 자회사들로 나뉠 것이고, 각각은 자유시장 경제 내에서 경쟁활동을 시작할 것이오." \n\n 여기서, 에르하르트는 폭탄 발언을 했다. 그는 각오하고 있었다. 압스는 소리를 지를 것이고, 두 사람은 에르하르트가 밖으로 나가버릴 때까지 서로에게 소리를 지를테며, 압스는 결국 패배할 것이었다. 따라서 그가 압스의 말을 들었을 때 놀람을 억제하기란 어려운 일이었다. \n\n "알겠소. 장관. 독일국을 위한 당신의 노고에 감사하오." \n 에르하르트의 턱은 다물어지지 않았고, 압스는 빙그레 웃었다. \n "당신이 놀라워하는게 보이긴 하오만, 공포스러워하지는 않는구만." \n "당신이 노예제를 폐지하고 자유 시장과 긍정적인 경쟁을 통해 새롭고, 경쟁력 있는 독일을 건설하고자 함을 나도 알고 있소. 나 역시 진심으로 당신에게 동의하고, 따라서 더 말해줄 것이 있소. 나는 몇 번이나 IG 파르벤의 노예 의존도를 줄여보고자 노력했소만, 다른 이사들이 항상 반대하더군. 당신의 솔선수범을 보니 너무나도 기쁘오." \n\n 마침내, 에르하르트는 압스와 악수를 할 수 있을 정도로 충분히 충격에서 벗어나며 이사진 회의에 참여할 필요성을 알려주었다. 에르하르트는 속을 넣은 의자에 등을 기대자마자 자신이 들은 것을 되돌아보기 시작했다. 압스는 거짓말을 하고 있었다. 분명히 그랬다. 그렇다면 왜 그랬을까? 어떤 이유로 2백만 라이히스마르크를 얻기 위해 일말의 거리낌 없이 수천 명을 죽음으로 몰고 갔던 자가 갑자기 노예제 폐지를 지지하게 되었을까? 무언가 잘못 돌아가고 있었지만, 에르하르트는 아무리 생각해도 답을 얻을 수 없었다."

We'll use this as a bargaining chip with the Americans, stalling the war until the outcome is favorable: the Americans will be the winners, but we won't be the losers, and they may even show their gratitude later..."\n"I disagree with herr Schmidt" von Tresckow's replies, incensed: "The Americans will exploit any weakness we show, and we must show none. Our relationship with the USA may change in the future, but for now they are our enemies, and we need to show that we are still a superpower!"\n"Go on, Feldmarschall" came Speer's interested reply.\n"Mein Führer, my plan of action is as follows: we send our Reichskommissars all the troops and supplies they need, while at the same time denying we are at war with the Americans. They won't be able to protest, as they are doing the same as us, and if we manage to prevail, they won't make the same mistake twice in future negotiations!"\n\nBoth plans are sound, and the choice is difficult. A leader, however, must act when needed: with a heavy heart, Speer knows that the Reich needs to..."

Another week, another meeting, another two hours of hearing his ministers quarrel about the strategy in this damn war. This time, however, the situation is different: the war is quickly evolving, and a final choice needs to be done, even he knows it. Dreading the next hour, the Führer coughs, distracting the two from their discussion: "Reichsminister Schmidt, Feldmarschall von Tresckow, make your arguments one final time: we need to decide now"\n\n"Easy done, mein Führer. Honestly, most if this isn't my work, but Reichsminister Erhard has devised a plan to ensure we can limit our losses as much as possible. To put it simply, we'll stall the war as long as we can, and liquidate all possible assets before retreating: we'll load up all extracted resources and bring them to Germany, evacuate the personnel, transfer all remaining supplies, sell state-owned companies and shares and drain all funds from the Reichskommissariaten. Once we have secured as much as we could, we'll abandon Africa altogether"\n\n"On one thing I agree with herr Schmidt" begins von Tresckow, "keeping Deutsch-Afrika may cost us more than any resource we are gaining now. Still, if we leave our possessions there, we'll do it when and how we want: we won't be dictated any kind of policy by a foreign power! To this end, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht has devised a series of special operations to defeat the Americans and win the war: they only need your approval, mein Führer"\n\nSpeer looks at the ceiling, deep in thought. The honor of the Reich demands retribution for this humiliation, but the costs may be more than what Germany can afford now... It's impossible to satisfy all parties involved, but the best choice clearly is to..."

The situation is difficult, but there are ample avenues for improvement: reorganize the supply chain, improve training, fire incompetent officers... One day, the Reich will have an army to match the Prussian golden age and the invasion of Poland! Sadly, even one of these reforms would take months, if not years to enact... As he waits for the secretary to announce his presence to the Führer, he can't help feeling pathetic. All his preaching about Prussian discipline, honor, need for reforms, and now... oh God, the mere thought makes him want to puke.\n\n"The Führer awaits you, Feldmarschall" the secretary's voice awakens von Tresckow from his thoughts, and he enters the adorned office. "Welcome, Feldmarschall" comes Speer's voice, to which he immediately salutes. "I heard you have a proposal to improve the war effort: please, by all means, enlighten me"\n"Mein Führer" he begins, then his mouth goes dry, sweat coating his face and dampening his uniform. Then, in a strangled voice, he explains: "We need to increase our troops' efficiency, and we need to do it quickly. For this reason, I advise sending stimulants to our troops"\n\n"Oh" was Speer's only reply. Clearly, he didn't expect the principled Prussian to come up with such a plan. "This goes against all you advocate, Feldmarschall. Are you sure this is the only way we can prevail?"\n\nA tense nod was his only answer, shame visible on the general's face."

What was different, however, was that the loading operations were heavily surveilled by Heer soldiers: their uniforms were so different, so pristine, and they looked more like bureaucrats than rugged soldiers.\n\nThe garrison commander had talked to the officer leading the operations. Apparently, they now needed to protect the loading operations, but when they asked why the Wehrmacht was guarding shipping procedures usually carried out by privates and mercenaries, all they were answered was that it was "sensitive informations".\n\nNow, they were looking through a list of cargoes, checking the ones already loaded.

Now we are lost, and as our hearts burn and our passion struggle, we are to accept our banishment. \n\n Stabbed in the back, we will turn away from this cowardly Speer. We refuse to see him as our Führer, and we will fight on - even if we are alone. And we will show them that we are more courageous than they are, even if it means dying, in either defeat or victory. \n\nBut how will we last if we have no more support from the Reich?

A welcome subordinate, especially in times as dark as now, the war against South Africa souring everything for Germany. He gestured to the Generalfeldmarschall to sit down with him.\n\n"Thank you, Generalfeldmarschall, for coming here," Speer said, "I understand you can help me find a solution for the war."\n\n"Yes, my Führer, I'm glad to help you. I'm eager to help you get this under control. This is an opportunity which will surely keep us out of too much trouble."\n\n"An opportunity for the military, von Tresckow?" Speer asked, an eyebrow raised at him.\n\n"Yes. We must impress the Heer, my Führer," he replied. "If we do this, we can keep them in line. They're getting restless because of this war. And I don't want them to break ranks and become a problem. I don't want their officers to sow discord, to make us look bad. Showing off our might on the battlefields of Africa and energizing the people so that they would support us even as we remove ourselves from the war would all be great for us in the end. And if we can do this, I can keep working with Speidel to continue our reforms."\n\n"You want to create a diversion? By intensifying the war?" Speer said, trying to understand what he meant by using this "opportunity."\n\n"Yes. This will keep the more troubling elements of our ranks from interfering or sabotaging our plans, and it will also give us better chances at withdrawing from the war. And above all, it would keep Schörner happy," the Prussian said, releasing a sharp but disgusted chuckle at mentioning the bastard from Munich. He continued, "In simpler terms, if we present a strong front, we can commit to our withdrawal without too many worries."\n\n"I see." Speer thought about it, letting von Tresckow look at him and wait. In time, the Führer looked up and told him, "Go on, Generalfeldmarschall.""

Preparations and canvassing for crews, cast, and settings were done. And plans for great shows and special effects were rolling through the minds of daring producers and scriptwriters.\n\nSuch efforts were being accomplished in record time all over Germany. And it helped the producers and the more creative types go on daring visits to the African Reichskommissariats; to see for themselves the legions of men who have chosen to give their lives for the Fatherland."

Strong, young men of the Fatherland were marching together as one, by unit, in the eyes of the entire world and of Germany.\n\nWithout shame in their faces, without guilt in their hearts, they, in their finest uniforms, their best helmets and boots, present themselves on foot, on their vehicles, and in their flying machines over the skies of the Reich to inspire their families and their friends.\n\nA wonderful stroke of propaganda. As Speer saluted them from his platform, together with his cabinet, the men who looked to him as they passed by, gathering their courage and resolve from his presence.\n\nHe thought of the days of Adolf Hitler as he saluted the men who won the Second World War for the Fatherland. Now he would do the same for these young souls who would win the battles for Africa.\n\nEven if there would be no great victory for the Reich and its African Reichskommissariats, it would at least keep the people and the Wehrmacht secure.

He had fought during the Civil War, and the factory he used to work at was rubble now, so in the end he had decided to stay in the Heer when the militias had been offered the choice between disbanding and formally joining the army. In those few months, he had seen what truly was the Wehrmacht: a massive den of corruption, where nepotism, incompetence and division ran rampant. The Truppenführer's favorites never stood guard and got nicer meals, while he had to cover for their turns or risk being accused of dereliction of duty.\n\nAlongside him, four others of his unit had volunteered, attracted by the steep rise in pay. Fedor, one of the former commander's cronies, had been killed by the Amerikaner when he had forgotten to put on his camouflage; the best part, however, had been when Johann, another one high on the list, had tried to convince the new officer to let him off a patrol citing "friends in high places". The officer had pointed the gun at his head, and asked for the names of his friends, then sent him to military prison for attempted corruption and dereliction of duty, and the list of names to Germania.\n\nThe weather was terrible, so humid his uniform was always damp, and so hot that it would still be damp even if it hadn't been so humid. Despite this, and despite the fact that the Amerikaner were bombing the hell out of him, he felt much better: he was fighting for his country with comrades he trusted and officers who cared for victory more than they did for their salaries.

On the positive side, hundreds of convoys are docking each week at Hamburg and Köln, bringing Afrika's wealth to the Reich, and the budget has drawn a relieved breath as the colonial expenses have been brutally slashed. On the negative side, however, the political landscape is quickly heating up: rallies both in favor and against withdrawal will be held in the next few days, and newspapers fuel the debate by siding with the reformists or the conservative hardliners.\n\n in order to put an end to the growing political tensions, the Führer has decided to hold a speech at Nuremberg. There, he'll explain to the nation why he had to take such a choice, and what will this new course mean for Germany and the larger Reich. A large crowd is expected to attend, and security will be extremely tight, but there is still the concrete chance that agitators will try to make themselves heard.

That way, they would be safely out of the hands of the advancing OFN. \n\nThe only price he had to pay for getting everything he could out of harm's way was the loss of territory and influence over Africa to the Americans and their allies. Now, they would be the ones to replace them, out there in the dark heart of Africa. \n\nEven if they do fail to achieve victory against the Fatherland's colonies in that continent, he told himself, we would at least rid ourselves off a sinking ship. The rising costs, the infighting among the governments of the three Reichskommmisariats against one another, and the growing strength of the OFN, all these were just too much for Germany to carry on her own.\n\nHe sighed, forcing himself to review the reports one last time before he closed them up and set them back into the basket.

Speakers ensured everyone attending could hear their Führer's voice, and dozens of camera crews covered those who couldn't be present. Albert Speer looked at the crowd, drew a large breath that sounded more like a sigh to himself, and then spoke.\n\n"Men and women of Nuremberg! Proud people of Germany! Loyal citizens of the Reich! Today is a great day, a day in which the future of this new, great country is set! After the ravages of the civil war, brought upon us by the corrupt kleptocrats that crowded Adolf Hitler's deathbed, came the unjust invasion of Deutsch-Afrika by the Americans: they took advantage of our momentary weakness to usurp our place in Africa!" he interrupted his speech for the scheduled popular outrage.\n\n"However, we managed to save as many good Germans as possible, because that's what a government does: it protects its people! And I will protect the Reich from its enemies! Unlike those who tried to usurp my predecessor's mantle, however, we shall achieve greatness through peace and reason! We shall be great again, and no one will dare to insult us ever again! Power through peace, supremacy through reason!" and then the applause began, sincere enough not to require the paid claque present as a safety measure.\n\nAs he stared at the crowd, drinking in the adoration, Speer couldn't fail to notice a small movement at the park's corner. There, a few young men and women stood holding picket signs, surrounded by the police: they were peaceful, but even in the distance, he could read one of the signs, and it made an unpleasant feeling creep through his spine."

By the time the clock struck midnight, the preparations were made, and roughly three hundred found themselves packed large, open space.\n\nThe shrill of an electric guitar caught their attention, and from the crackle of the microphone on the makeshift stage a voice came. "Ladies and gentlemen of Germany! People from top to bottom, I welcome all of you!" There was a cheer that spread outwards, and as the noise settled, he continued. "Glad you folks came here to celebrate, because I've got a few songs for you all. Let's make it quick, eh? I know what you're all here for! You're all here 'cause...?"\n\nThe crowd took only a moment's pause to consider his words, then, in unison, shouted.\n\n"NO MORE WARS ACROSS THE WORLD!"\n\nWith cheers and whistles, the man chuckled and leaned back from the microphone. "Our first song goes out to Reichskommissariat Hans Hüttig - the old, decrepit bastard!" And with a final roll of the guitar, the cacophony of rock and roll began, clearing a path distant into the night, as watchful eyes from beyond observed and noted how the counterculture movement ebbed its way toward places it had no right being in."

Sources are light and fractured on what could have caused it, but police reports have spoken mainly about a single fact. It began in the University of Vienna, and spread from there in an almost sporadic-like fashion. Newsreels couldn't resist the opportunity to show footage of thousands flooding the streets, running headlines about punks and students holding down confrontations with police cars.\n\nGoing down to the street view, further reports showed that there was a common message with the protestors. All of them had variations, but they resonated all the same.\n\n"BRING THE WAR HOME!"\n"NO MORE BOYS ON AFRICAN SHORES!"\n"THE REICHSKOMMISSARIAT THREE CAN DO IT ON THEIR OWN!"\n\nMost importantly there was one that was starkly common amidst the protestors, which was the phrase "NO MORE WARS ACROSS THE WORLD!". Police have suspected that this phrase had connotations in Mainz and other cities nearby, and has spread rapidly throughout the entirety of Germany. After a period of three days, with tense stand-offs with police, Vienna began calming down, with the almost-ten-thousand dispersing into less than five thousand, but the voices remained strong, and it seemed like the people of Germany were catching on to the situation in the South African War."

There were too little officers prepared to deal with entire streets packed with people chanting for the war to end abruptly, and those that attempted to calm them were only met with furious rebuttals and, in some rare cases, violent reprisals. Sometimes, people would pass by and picket the Volkshalle, and while they were quickly moved out, it was to the point when the government would be utterly blind to not notice how public opinion has soured.\n\nIt had even come to the point where Albert Speer began taking different routes to the Reichskanzlei and the Volkshalle, in order to not be stopped by protestors and deal with their anger and frustration, and many officials in the NSDAP began travelling more covertly in order to not be harassed likewise."

However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways. \n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

His very presence presented a great opportunity, both for his country and for him, and he was not one to waste it with grandstanding and machismo.

Hitler and his cronies shunned sensible policy for ideology, and our government intends to rectify his mistakes." \n\n"I have seen the work of your Herr Erhard, and it is most impressive.

The convertible in which they both sat was cruising on a slow parade between blocks of marching soldiers, and Sidos gave his nonchalant wave to each and every one as he passed. Their uniforms were faded and patched, their weapons of such a range that most could only have come from a Breton port, but the look on their faces was one of steely determination. Schmidt had never seen the manual of arms performed with such machinelike precision by what he was told were fresh recruits. \n\n"You see our preparations are well underway, Monsieur Schmidt. France has had its fill of being Europe's whipping boy - when the next war with Burgundy comes, we will be ready." He was wilfully ignoring the litany of treaty violations he was revealing. \n\nSchmidt responded in French himself - when you're selling to someone it's smart to speak their language. "Most impressive indeed. It is good to see France's élan yet remains." \n\n"You are an excellent flatterer, Monsieur, but it will get you nowhere. France has demands no honeyed words can fulfill. Burgundy is a threat to both our nations, one that as much as the French dislike the idea, they must work with Germany to destroy. Your government must commit itself to the destruction of the Black State within the near future. Only then will the French people even begin to consider working with their old enemy.""

The square was packed with Bordeaux's garrison, many of whom would be occupying the tent city outside if not for the chance of food, sleep and vengeance against the Burgundians they had fled from. Schmidt felt an uncanny sense of unease as they paraded between across the eyelines of the blank-faced troops. Despite their vacant expressions, he could feel their concentrated glares as though he were an ant pinned beneath a magnifying glass. \n\n"France's crème de la crème," Sidos remarked, enjoying watching Schmidt attempt to suppress the involuntary instinct to sweat. "Every one of them French born, French trained, and French armed. We have learned from our mistakes, and will not rely on any nation but ourselves." \n\nSchmidt had been wondering when to bring up this topic, but it seemed Sidos was forging ahead himself. "The Zollverein is not reliance, but cooperation." \n\n"Phrase it however you will, we will have none of it. We can work with Germany, but we will not rely on your arms - not with your history. Our vision of France is not compatible with your Zollverein." "

They had made polite conversation, but Helmut saw it was not the conversation that Pinay had brought him here for. The road beside which they walked had been shelled, filled, and potholed again. Despite the inordinate number of people filling the streets, half the shops were  closed, their doorways instead filled with vagrants. As they reached a lull in their conversation, they passed by an overturned bin, in which a street urchin was scavenging - Helmut had thoughts such sights to be confined to the realm of Charles Dickens this far west. He felt a lump in his stomach.\n\n"You see the scars that Germany has wrought upon our country," Antoine finally said, affixing his gaze to Schmidt's.\n\n"Tragic indeed, but Himmler acts of his own accord. We have renounced him, you demanded as much." As much as Schmidt hated to say it, he was here as a diplomat.\n\n"You will find no man in France who sees this distinction. The SS is a German organisation, is it not? Was it not created with the approval of Hitler? Was it not he who granted Himmler the heartland of France, who armed him, whose death led to deaths of thousands? While Himmler's murder and torture now continues of it's own accord, it was under Germany's mandate that it began.

His plans are impressive, I must admit, but I have my reservations. France has been bound to the hip with the Reich once before, and the results were catastrophic - this is half the reason Himmler was so able to overcome us." \n\n"The economic fumbling of Hitler's days is long over," Schmidt assured him. "Our government believes in nothing more than sense and stability." \n\n"You speak well, but we must have assurances.

At the conclusion of dessert, Bichelonne put down his spoon and gave a satisfied sigh. "So, how is Albert?" referring no doubt to the Führer. \n\n"He is well, if perhaps a bit... overworked. He expressed his regrets he couldn't be here himself." \n\n"I bet he's losing his mind. No buildings, just endless complaints." At that Schmidt gave a slight smile. \n\n"You are lucky I am president, for I doubt others would give Germany the time of day. You are here to see our countries allied, and that is good, but for France to be an ally worthy of speaking of, she needs some care. German industry would go a long way towards making France's economy something to be proud of, rather than ashamed of.""

He had in fact spent the last few minutes in praise of Erhard, to the point it started to grate on Schmidt. \n\n"The Zollverein is an ambitious plan, a great link between the nations of Europe. It is about time the spirit of cooperation overtook the continent, and swept away that of war. Of course, France's interests must be considered." \n\n"This is why I am here," Schmidt reassured, grateful that Bichelonne had left at least some of the job of selling the project to him.\n\n"For France to be truly integrated into the Zollverein, it requires some reconstruction. The war took its toll on our industry, but with Germany's help it can be restored to what it once was. France's share of the budget should appropriately reflect the disproportionate hardship she has undergone.""

The words still rung in Schmidt's ears as they walked about the Mayor's Palace, now the de facto royal palace. From his friends in the Reichsnachdienst he had heard Versailles was in no condition to host a king. After the initial introductions Henri had seemed humble, almost embarrassed at the charade, but the idea was still bouncing about Schmidt's brain that he was the first German diplomat to converse with a French king since Napoleon III's defeat at Sedan.\n\n"It is a unique situation we find ourselves in. While I am not one to speculate, I imagine it is about as easy to get France to side with Germany as it is to persuade the French to restore a king." Henri's joke prompted a polite chuckle from Schmidt. \n\n"We live in interesting times." \n\n"Interesting indeed. I am no fool to reject your offer out of hand, but a king must do what is best for his people. My people will never love the Reich, but they could be persuaded to tolerate it, if reparation is made for past wrongs. You have seen the terror Burgundy has wrought upon this country - until people cannot see the scars, they cannot heal." \n\n"

And while uniting the continent as friends with your Zollverein is an admirable idea, but France has no friends - only interests." The King was enjoying a glass of wine with Schmidt in his study. While everything in the room was of the finests craftsmanship, it was decorated sparsely, with none of the outrageous luxury one might expect. A wise decision, considering what his predecessor's magnificence had bought them. "I can assure you, the Zollverein is in everyone's best interests." \n\n"So you say, but I am afraid your diplomats do not have the best reputation for honesty." The King gave a smirk at this, and Helmut was forced to concede with a nod. "France must make it's own decisions.

Before he had disappeared, he had presented his final and greatest demand. \n\nSchmidt had not had reason to consider Brittany for some time. The newly formed peninsular state had been one of Hitler's more peculiar ideas, ripped from France in the fifties as part of his divide and conquer strategy. He had heard Erhard cursing the Breton black market for undercutting many German goods in his eternal crusade to fix the economy, but other than that their less savoury entrepreneurial activities they had largely kept to themselves. The Accord of Nantes left them frozen in stasis. \n\n[FRA.GetLeader] had insisted that Brittany once more be united with France. The Accord must be renounced, and France's territorial integrity restored, he said - but the French State was in no condition to mount such an invasion alone. As much as it burned to admit it, they needed German help. "

Then, in the middle of the night he was escorted out, with barely a chance to grab his suitcase. His pilot had evidently been awoken in a similar manner, and was still clad in his pyjamas. His host had not even done him the courtesy of a goodbye. A simple warning from a hulking guard in royal blue was sufficient - do not return. \n\nThis was going to be a short flight, so he would have to think fast about what to tell Speer on his return.

Even a French-Breton phrasebook had been developed, as the local language had overtaken the use of French in some areas. \n\nAir superiority would be easy to achieve, but they would have to be careful planning their naval cordon - Breton smugglers had a thousand and one ways to sneak through a blockade, and it would be preferable to capture the government that they could force a surrender.  Actions along the Burgundian border were to be avoided whenever possible - a border skirmish at this time could develop into something disastrous, and Germany would be forced to respond in full force in the event of another Franco-Burgundian war.

Whilst he would gladly treat himself to more French hospitality his work here was done, and his time to enjoy the fruits of his labour all too limited. There was always another task, and now that Germany had upheld it's end of the bargain it was time for France to do the same. No doubt once his report was complete he'd be dragged back into the minutiae of Einheitspakt laws and regulations, but there was time enough to enjoy his triumph. \n\nThere was a beauty to Bordeaux, even in its diminished state.

"Mister Kubiyovich," he began, speaking in German-tinted Ukrainian. "As you know, you are collaborators of the Greater German Reich. And as you also know, we have recently had a shift in administration. Most importantly, as it stands, we are at a precipice. Can you tell us why the Rada should be kept?"\n\nKubiyovich nodded. "Of course. The reasoning is simple: if you wish to keep the population content with your rule, you must give them a semblance of democracy. Besides that, a civilian administration will be less of a burden on the Reich, and will have long-term positive effects on the popular perception of Ukraine remaining in the Einheitspakt." Spoken like a true collaborator, Weidenmann noted.\n\nThe German nodded. "I believe this shall bring our negotiations to a close, Mister Kubiyovich.

Oh. "Your former working residence was the Taras Shevchenko University, which was demolished in accidental-" Pah. Accidental. "-artillery fire during the Second World War.

He had objected (and as politely as he could, it must be added) to a focus on Japanese reconciliation. Germania's focus should be elsewhere; anywhere but Tokyo. Schmidt had reiterated his concerns to the Führer, hoping that the old man might see the light, but with the same oh-so-friendly smile that Schmidt had come to hate, Speer placed the tickets in his hands and ushered him out the door. \n\nNow, he stood in Tokyo, those vile white banners with their embalmed blood-red suns taunting him as he left the airport. Hitler's Germany had been abysmal, and Speer's regime had proved only superficially better, but at least both had the humility of a nominal republic. Schmidt gazed out the window at the corrupt symbols of the Japanese nation, an Empire built on the rape of China and the Pacific."

 speerjapan.2.t:0 "The "Glory" From Within"
 speerjapan.2.desc:0 ""Our men stand with absolute loyalty to the Führer and the national ideal," Helmut Schmidt said in forced pleasantry to the Japanese men opposite him. One of the younger gentlemen was furiously scribbling on a notepad, looking up at the foreign minister regularly with an expression of wonder and intrigue. "The Wehrmacht is the ultimate disciplined oppositional force to the American threat." \n\nAnd it was the ultimate disciplined force. Schmidt had been only eighteen when he joined the Wehrmacht and had seen firsthand the suffering and carnage it caused. Russian men had been slaughtered before his eyes, innocents and soldiers alike crushed under the heel of Hitler's eastward march. Here he was, however, praising its glories. What kind of monster was he, celebrating the military-industrial complex which had brought Germany's neighbours death and sorrow, before creating the near national suicide of the Civil War. \n\n"How you describe the Wehrmacht would greatly interest the Prime Minister and perhaps our Emperor. I think this meeting has borne some great fruit for future cooperation between our nations." Schmidt sighed. He had succeeded."
 speerjapan.2.a:0 "Victory is such sweet sorrow."

 speerjapan.3.t:0 "The Threat From Without"
 speerjapan.3.desc:0 ""Consider this President. He seems stable now, no?" Schmidt offered to his Japanese interlocutors. "At any moment, however, he can be replaced by a man of completely opposite character. Every eight years, this is certain, but he receives a challenge midway through his term, and his powers risk restraint every two years from that Congress of theirs. Your Empire would do better with a certain partner. Our Führer, like your Emperor, is guaranteed for an entire lifetime." \n\nSchmidt wishes that Speer wasn't. He longed for America's instability. He longed for her progress, made in short jumps, not centurial designs. His career might suffer, yes, but what was a career for the chance of liberation? Certainly, he would prefer honest poverty to his present hypocritical privileges. \n\nThe argument, however, hit home for the Japanese. Schmidt's suited counterparts nodded in agreement with every line, in almost unwavering agreement with the German line."

 speerjapan.4.t:0 "The Blue Scare"
 speerjapan.4.desc:0 "Speer wondered sometimes if Hitler's ghost still roamed the Chancellory's halls. The old Führer still certainly haunted Speer's plans. That fool had the gall for a near assassination, and by the Kempeitai of all people, meaning Germany's population is still suspicious, if not outright hostile, to the idea of Japanese alignment. No matter. A good counternarrative wasn't something the Führer was unused to crafting. \n\nThe Deputy Führer was called into the office and a plan was hatched. Kiesinger's friends in the conservative wing of the Party would be contacted, with warnings of America's capitalist degeneracy infecting the Germany they have worked so hard to perfect. In contrast, the Japanese, our traditional allies in the Axis powers, are icons of tradition, stability and hegemony. Conservative newspapers and radio networks would broadcast this line of thinking, and the country would be brought in line with the Führer's vision. \n\nWashington's favour will falter, but the greatest nations are rarely allied without the blood of another. A sacrifice worthy to sway the German population."

 speerjapan.5.t:0 "History Rewritten"
 speerjapan.5.desc:0 "Anti-Japanese sentiment in Germany has cooled, but not disappeared. However, anti-Americanism has quickly supplanted its role in the national conscience. In a controversial interview, the Führer told a conservative talk show host that new evidence gathered by the RND suggested that the Kempeitai had nothing to do with Hitler's assassination, and in fact, it had been a CIA operation all along. Polling data today shows that the German pubic's favour for Japan has superseded that of its favour for the United States. A shift in perspective has begun."

It is no secret that our financial and industrial complexes have been historically turbulent, and even with Erhard's best efforts, the heart of Germany's production beats slower than it did in its youth. Trade and liberalisation bring great boons, however. Japanese firms, the Zaibatsu and others, have indicated keenness to invest in the Reich, particularly the Ruhr and our other industrial heartlands. This stimulant, Erhard tells us, will give German companies the push they need to increase their staff sizes and reduce our national unemployment issues. \n\nMoney isn't free, however. The Japanese would like to reach an agreement regarding their side of the contract, wherein we ease our protectionist policies and lift tariffs on their companies. The conservatives of the Reich may not be pleased with this, but it seems like the only choice. The Japanese certainly make it appear as such."

 speerjapan.7.desc:0 "Japan brings with it possible augmentations to the German machine that will make us a fearsome presence on the world stage. Since our alliance broke apart, our nations have developed technology in isolation, and Japanese science has advanced in ways our Wehrmacht must take full advantage of. Beyond just shared mechanical advances and joint drills, the Japanese alliance brings with it unprecedented geopolitical advantage. With an ally dominating Asia, our spheres would form a co-defensive shield, allowing us to spread our influence without a knife in the back, from them or anyone else. \n\nThere is a, well, peculiar addendum to these benefits. Japan has requested that Germany assist with their 'policing actions', a series of activities Germania has been granted suspiciously little details on."

However, as Schmidt hangs up the line to Germania, he cannot help but feel that there is more to Germany's new friends in Tokyo than meets the eye. \n\nHe sits in his hotel room with a cigar, pondering. Was it the way they spoke and dress? The over-politeness that made him suspicious? Surely not, as since he was a boy Schmidt had heard of the properness and honour of the Japanese culture. It did not seem out of place. Was it their insistence? But what were they insistent on? Tariff removal, something even old Erhard preached the merits of. It was odd though, the way they pushed it, at every meeting emphasising these economic agreements. He could not shake the feeling that Germany was running headfirst into a trap. \n\nIt was late, however, and the foreign minister crushed his cigar in the ashtray. These were thoughts for tomorrow morning."

 speerjapan.9.desc:0 "Had Bismarck been in rooms like this? Had Von Metternich? Was Schmidt following in their footsteps as he approached the Japanese delegation across from him? Daily life in Germania had been exciting, to begin with, but the rotation between the Volkshalle and the Chancellory had become far more mundane than Schmidt had ever thought foreign affairs could be. In these moments, though, he felt that he was acting not as just himself, but as the whole legacy of German geopolitics. In the skies above, those mythical heroes of Germany's ambassadorial tradition, Schmidt liked to think, were looking over him. A blind spot had emerged, however. The daydreams of the Reich's foreign minister were shattering slowly as he, and his delegation, realised that they had been conned. \n\nIn many ways, it was too late. The negotiations had already started, and the Japanese were pressing for the removal of their tariffs. This would, according to the Reich's economist at the delegation, mean Germany would be economically dependent on Japan for almost five years. The holiday to Tokyo, it seemed, had been a little less than a free lunch. \n\nGermany's delegation considered its options. The deal, as it was, could be accepted. Diplomatic relations improve, things remain cordial, and we all return home to Germania after a nice holiday in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Or, we could try and bargain down the tariff removal and perhaps reduce Japan's proposed scheduling as well. Not only would Germany maintain her economic dependence, but Schmidt might just about maintain his life when he next sees Erhard."

The Empire's offer would have to be accepted. \n\nThe Reich would remove all tariffs on Japanese imports for the next five years. The delegation's consensus, behind closed doors, seemed to be that Germany was on its way to economic vassaldom. For half a decade, the cheaper goods of the East would likely flood and monopolise Europe's market. Schmidt felt that, when he left, it would be with his tail between his legs. However, better he leave a negotiation with an outcome than run from a diplomatic breakdown and ruin all the progress the two nations had made already. What was it the Iberians say?"

However, Schmidt had come with an agenda. Germany's next proposal was to be presented, and the Reich's foreign minister was hopeful. \n\nGermany needed investment, and with its Frankensteinish economy still barely putting itself back together, growth was a necessity. Particularly, large corporations had vacuumed up much of the market and monopoly had become the norm for the Reich. Schmidt wanted to request for Japanese investment into the economy, with special focus on the smaller businesses that needed to be jump-started into success and expand Germany's middle class. Improving employment was also a major issue for the new Germany, and a large part of the solution was diversifying the range of employers."

 speerjapan.16.t:0 "A Dissapointing Offer"
 speerjapan.16.desc:0 "Japan holds steadfast. The first deal from the Empire is investment, but only in the form of shares of some major German corporations. Not only will this have little effects on Schmidt's hopeful goals of reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth, but will also buy Tokyo influence in Germany's economy with no gain for the Reich. Needless to say, Germania's foreign minister is remarkably disappointed. \n\nSchmidt sees himself with two options. Either Germany accepts this imperfect deal, or keeps pushing for larger concessions, risking Japan's favour."

This arrangement is imperfect, yes, but it is a step in the right direction. \n\nDelegation consensus on the German end finished with an acceptance that the Reich's best interest was to accept the Japanese deal. At the end of the day, some investment is better than none, and Germany's economy is in dire need of all the assistance it can get.

If Japan sends more of it's good investors to Germany, not only will Japanese investors make more money, but your Empire will reap the taxable benefits of this prosperity, and our firms will be encouraged to issue more stock. It is an exponential cycle, gentlemen, and both our great nations stand to benefit." \n\nMurmurs across the table end with the nod of the leader of Japan's delegation.

A far more agreeable Japanese delegation than Schmidt had anticipated seemed to move forward, at least in spirit, as a group, listening to Schmidt intently. Schmidt suddenly felt the weight one does when they're the sole focal point of attention in the room. With an undetectable gulp and disguised tension, the foreign minister continued. \n\n"The logical choice, my friends, is to invest in the promising industry of German infrastructure. According to our reports, perfected by the great economists of the Reich under the internationally renowned Ludwig Erhard, the industry is due for a cyclical boom period; very, very soon. With the expansion of more firms across the country, your investments will reap even further profit and have access to a wider market of potential suitors. With these new investments into infrastructure, more firms in the general economy will be established, not just in this specific industry. An efficient road and rail system across the Reich will inevitably lead to a reduction of transport costs, incentivising business creation, and thus the production of new investment partners for the Reich and the Empire." The foreign minister, feeling especially Bismarckian, paused for effect. "Gentlemen, it is basic economics." \n\nNods and mutters of agreement bubbled on the Japanese side. Schmidt, at this point, figured himself well able to read the Japanese crowd. He knew what this meant. Another victory. The German foreign minister smiled, pleased with himself, and knowing that his nation would similarly be pleased. The once magnificent Autobahns and railways of the Reich would now have the funds to be reborn in a shape and condition worthy of the country they span."

 speerjapan.21.desc:0 "Look. What we have agreed upon already is a great accomplishment. I strongly believe, however, that further Japanese investment into the Reich's infrastructure would be even more beneficial to both of our nations. Any risk you may perceive in such investments, I assure you, only exists in the immediate term as we continue our ongoing recovery efforts from the internal conflict. As the Reich continues to regain its footing and reclaim its spot as the world's foremost economy, any hint of doubt regarding our situation will rapidly fade away. And, of course, such great economic collaboration now is guaranteed to foster strong economic ties between our nations in the future and improve the Empire of Japan's image in the eyes of the German people... and investors." \n\nNo response. Damn it! He just had to push it that much further, didn't he? Why couldn't he keep his stupid mouth shut? \n"With all due respect, Foreign Minister Schmidt, relations between our countries are still new, and we do not exactly have investors clamoring to enter the German market given the current circumstances," replied the head of the Japanese delegation. "Were you not satisfied with our already generous offer? We will have to discuss and perhaps even reconsider our previous proposal. My apologies, Foreign Minister"

 speerjapan.22.desc:0 "On to the next phase of negotiations. The next topic was easily the second-most important one to Schmidt after rejuvenating the economy for the sake of the German working class: combating imperialism. Or, as the topic was titled at the negotiating table, "non-involvement".\nSurely, as the upcoming round of discussions began, the Japanese would ask Schmidt to provide guarantees that Germany would not get itself involved in internal (or maybe even external) Co-Prosperity Sphere affairs. These were not promises Schmidt wished to make, as he strongly opposed Japan's violent hegemony over Asia, but depending on how many demands he could wriggle the Reich out of, it would maybe be possible for such promises to secretly be empty ones; Germany might be able to assist, for example, the rebels fighting for freedom in Indonesia.\nSchmidt chewed on the fine line he would have to walk if he wanted to seem amicable to Japan's interests while also trying to help the world become a slightly less brutal and evil place."

We have reason to believe that there may be certain foreign influence in Japan's internal affairs, and we would like certain assurances from Germany that you are, erm, doing everything in your power to prevent aid from reaching these traitors. We ask that all German ships travelling through Co-Prosperity Sphere waters be submitted to cargo checks prior to entry. Understand that this is essential to the Sphere's internal security, Herr Schmidt." \nSchmidt replied, "Searching every single vessel to pass through the Sphere's territorial waters could greatly hurt our profit margins and slow down our shipping... Of course, I understand why you ask this of us." \nSchmidt was not happy with any agreement that would hurt Germany's economic recovery, and therefore its working class. The Japanese delegation knew this, of course. What they did not know about was Schmidt's sympathies towards the Indonesian freedom fighters who, while not necessarily seeing eye-to-eye with Schmidt on every issue, at least had the guts to actually stand up and openly fight facism. But was this worth souring relations with Japan yet again? Germany desperately needed economic partners."

The Reich will allow all shipping to pass through Sphere waters to have its cargo examined in exchange for your valuable investments," stated Schmidt to the Japanese delegation. \nThe pleasantly surprised look on the faces of the Japanese delegation implied they had expected at least a bit of negotiating. Abandoning any chance of helping the Indonesian rebels escape Japan's fascist grip left an uneasy feeling in Schmidt's stomach, but he figured that this show of goodwill towards the Japanese now would at least pay off for Germany later."

But we do acknowledge your internal security concerns. How about we make official inspections of all cargo ships before they leave Germany to ensure that no materials are being smuggled in order to undermine Japanese sovereignty? We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments." \nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. And it seemed to make sense to the Japanese as well. Resignedly, the head of their delegation responded, "Yes, that would be an acceptable compromise. But of course we insist we receive all of your inspection reports so we know exactly what is entering our waters." \n"That will be no problem at all," replied Schmidt jovially, knowing this would be enough for him to at least somewhat help the Indonesian rebels in their fight against Japan. He supposed it was the small victories that really counted."

But it seemed to be quite unsatisfactory to the Japanese delegation. Stiffly, the head of the delegation responded, "No. We must insist upon inspections of German cargo. We cannot utterly compromise our national security for the sake of speeding up your shipping! I am afraid that if you cannot agree to this, we will be forced to reconsider our previous agreements." \nWhoops. Now the Japanese would likely inspect German ships with a great deal of suspicion and care.

Not everything does. It was always a risk, you know."\n\n "It wasn't a risk, it was diplomatic suicide! Since when has Germany offered to send PT boats to Indonesia just to "cut off the Americans"? Of course they'd see through that! I don't understand it, my Fuhrer, I really don't." Schmidt sighed. "I had a deal and everything, too. One that wasn't too bad for our interests, or at least didn't ruin our relations."\n\nSpeer shrugged. "Again, we gambled and we lost.

Relations, of course, have been historically. . .strained, and as such, our technological cooperation has been all but non-existent. I propose that we should rectify this oversight, for the benefit of both our nations."\n\nThe ambassador regarded Schmidt calmly, tapping his hand on his table. "I see." He began. "But what sort of technology would we be sharing?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "Depends on what we agree to." The ambassador continued to watch Schmidt closely, the two men looking for any betrayal of either's ulterior motives. After a moment, the man stood.\n\n"Technological sharing would certainly be a boon for us both. I like the idea, Schmidt." He said. Schmidt smiled- it was a good start."
 speerjapan.29.a:0 "To work, then."

 speerjapan.30.t:0 "Opening Moves"
 speerjapan.30.desc:0 "The shutters of the Ambassador's windows were closed today, giving the room a sense of privacy. Schmidt took his seat gently as the Japanese ambassador watched him, the fluorescent lights in the roof giving off a bright glow. The ambassador began. "So, Schmidt, what is the Reich interested in obtaining from Japan?"\n\nSchmidt cleared his throat. "The Kriegsmarine and the Heer have both expressed interest in some of Japan's advancements. Navally, it is no contest- the IJN clearly outpaces our underwater capabilities. On the ground, I believe we are about even, but some areas are certainly more advanced in Tokyo than in Germania. Hell, there may even be some parts of your air doctrine we could use. In short, the Heer asks for some of your military advancements, and we are more than willing to pay for them."\n\nThe ambassador pondered for a moment before replying. "I would hope so, Schmidt, but I do not believe the IJA or IJN are as willing to hand over their secrets as I am. However, I've been reassured that neither branch has an issue with sharing some of our RADAR and communication techs. Would this be an acceptable compromise to you?"\n\nNow it was Schmidt's turn to go through the options. "I take it this is not a take it or leave it offer?"\n\nThe ambassador smiled. "Depends on what you say next. I'm sure I can do some convincing, if needed.""
 speerjapan.30.a:0 "Yes, we can do that."
 speerjapan.30.b:0 "Allow me to retort, if you will..."

 speerjapan.31.t:0 "The Easy Solution"
 speerjapan.31.desc:0 "Schmidt read Speer's letter with a mixture of annoyance and resignation. It was everything he had expected it to be- perfunctory, disappointed, and with the barest hint of congratulations smeared over it. Of course Speer would be disappointed- he never had to actually talk to the Japanese. He just got to sit back and reap the rewards.\n\nOf course Schmidt could have pushed harder. The ambassador had left it open. The issue was, of course, that trying to push it was risky. If Schmidt had gambled and lost, would Speer say "Oh, that's ok. You tried your best."? No, of course not. He'd be just as disappointed as he was now. He clearly didn't understand, thought Schmidt as he sat down in his chair, just how tough it is to negotiate a detente with a power that you've been actively threatening for decades. Sure, they didn't get everything they wanted. That's how compromise works. They got something, and they get the detente that was so important. I'd call that a win myself, Schmidt thinks.\n\nHe sighed as he grabbed his lighter and a smoke. Speer never seemed to understand the finer details of international diplomacy. In the end, Speer was only an architect, not a diplomat. Maybe he'd never understand the finer points of negotiation.\n\nSometimes, Schmidt really hated having to work for him."
 speerjapan.31.a:0 "Good enough."

 speerjapan.32.t:0 "In Deep"
 speerjapan.32.desc:0 ""Well." Schmidt began, eyeing the Ambassador's watchful gaze. "To go through all this effort just for a few radios and communication advancements would be quite unsatisfactory, in my opinion. I believe that we can certainly do more with each other than just that."\n\nThe ambassador tilted his head. "What do you suggest?" Schmidt's eye's shifted around the room as he thought.\n\n "Attaches, perhaps, to aid our military. Plane technology- those bombers of yours have quite a range, perhaps that would be a useful tool for our Luftwaffe. Hell, maybe even some naval technology, like gun computation or navigation, or perhaps anti-air capabilities."\n\nThe ambassador stiffened in his chair. "And what do you propose to give us?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?"\n\nThe ambassador thought for a moment, and an uncomfortable silence entered the room. Schmidt did his best to hide the rising tide of worry inside of him. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the ambassador responded. "I believe that is a workable compromise.""
 speerjapan.32.a:0 "Good to do business with you."
 speerjapan.32.b:0 "Well, let me make one more offer."

 speerjapan.33.desc:0 ""My friends, is it really worth all of this effort just to exchange some radios and communication advancements? That would be quite unsatisfactory, in my opinion.

Plane technology- those bombers of yours have quite a range, perhaps that would be a useful tool for our Luftwaffe.

"I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?" \nAn uncomfortable silence entered the room. Everyone stared at the head of the delegation, awaiting his response. "We cannot accept this deal. I can see that Germany is enthusiastic to share technology and cooperate with Japan, and Japan does indeed feel the same way. But I predict this is simply beyond what our armed forces are willing to accept, and we have no desire to push them to do so." \nThat was unfortunate. Though for Schmidt, the issue was not the failure to develop Germany and Japan's militaries, but merely relaying this failure to Speer who would no doubt be angry. Ultimately, it wouldn't really matter too much, Schmidt supposed."
 speerjapan.33.a:0 "Ah well."

 speerjapan.34.t:0 "A Reluctant Deal"
 speerjapan.34.desc:0 "Schmidt hung up the phone angrily. He hated negotiating for things which would only bring more harm to the world.

If they ended up at war with a power strong enough for Germany to need such a large navy, it would probably be the end of the world anyway. Sighing, Schmidt left his hotel and returned for another day of diplomatic negotiations. \n"Good day to you all. While we recently came to an agreement on an exchange of military support for some of your technology, Germany would actually be interested in taking this deal further. We understand that Japan has made major strides in naval technology, and Germany is very interested in the fruits of these advancements. We are prepared to offer you a substantial sum for it... in cash." \nEyebrows raised, the members of the Japanese delegation pondered and privately discussed Schmidt's offer for a moment before coming to a decision. "Seeing as we won't be fighting you in the foreseeable future, we see no reason not to sell you our advanced naval technology. Now then, shall we begin negotiating the price?" asked the head of the delegation, who made little effort to hide his greed. Schmidt nodded, hiding his disdain for the wasteful deal he had himself just brought to fruition."

 speerjapan.36.t:0 "An Urgent Start"
 speerjapan.36.desc:0 "Our ploy to gain a great degree of control over the German economy is only thinly veiled. \nAs soon as he received our request to eliminate trade tariffs for five years, German Foreign Minister Schmidt immediately called our diplomatic office from his hotel and requested that trade negotiations begin as soon as possible. While we would not exactly refer to this request as a trap, it seems that Germany's sharp and quick-witted foreign minister senses our... ulterior motives. \nThere is a great degree of logic to opening diplomatic relations with the Germans, but why shouldn't we get as much out of it as possible? We'll offer to remove tariffs on each other's goods for five years, which will yield us a great amount of influence over the German economy during that period. If you want global power and influence, you're going to have to twist some arms. Let the German delegation come and negotiate with us tomorrow, and we will see just how much Japan stands to gain from their desperation."
 speerjapan.36.a:0 "Let's see if they look their gift horse in the mouth"

 speerjapan.37.t:0 "Not as Easy as we Thought"
 speerjapan.37.desc:0 ""With all respect, my friends, I think this deal is a great mistake for your nation." Already, a bold claim. "Your firms would likely choose to export into the German market more with these tariffs removed, no? This choice, to sell in a market where there's no supply but ample demand, will make your companies very rich. Too rich, perhaps. Think of your Zaibatsus. Does your state need more challenge, more corporate power from a new generation of monopolistic plutocrats? Gentlemen, I encourage you to think beyond the money. We must temper your plan for tariff reduction, and maintain protection for your sake. All the gold in Germania is not worth sacrificing the integrity of your state."\nWell then, it seems he had thoroughly thought things through before the day's negotiations. Any mention of the Zaibatsus challenging Japanese state power was already enough to turn many heads among our delegation. While it was more than certain that Schmidt was trying to maximize the potential negative consequences of our proposal because he didn't like it, his point remained valid and hung in the air stubbornly.\nThe head of our delegation had the opportunity of holding firm on our existing offer or accepting Schmidt's counteroffer of shortening the lifting of tariffs to three years with the Germans showing no preferable treatment to the Japanese market. It would not be as beneficial for Japan, but perhaps there was some sense in trying to smooth relations with Germany..."
 speerjapan.37.a:0 "Mr. Schmidt, you make a compelling case..."
 speerjapan.37.b:0 "...but we cannot agree to your proposal."

 speerjapan.38.t:0 "A More Limited Deal"
 speerjapan.38.desc:0 "Would Helmut Schmidt ever be satisfied with what we offered? Even after we allowed him to negotiate us down to a less extensive tariff removal agreement, he has continued to try and push us further. "To be frank with you all, I am still not entirely sure that the deal we have arranged in its current form is all too beneficial to Germany or Japan. I think we can do better."\nThe foreign minister had to know he was getting closer and closer to a line he should not cross, but he must have been willing to do whatever it took to secure the best possible outcome for Germany. In the name of cooperation and friendship, maybe we could concede to him a little more?"
 speerjapan.38.a:0 "Yes, that wouldn't be the end of the world."
 speerjapan.38.b:0 "Enough is enough, already!"

 speerjapan.39.t:0 "Another Point of Discussion"
 speerjapan.39.desc:0 "We had thought the only topic of our negotiations with the German delegation would be tariffs, but German Foreign Minister Schmidt had come with an agenda.\nSchmidt requested assistance to the German economy in the form of Japanese investments into small businesses and to help increase employment. The look on his face while he made the proposal indicated that he was genuine and passionate in his desire to help the German people get back on their feet, but we above all needed to ensure that whatever deal was struck was beneficial to Japan. Our delegation discussed the matter before giving the foreign minister our proposal."
 speerjapan.39.a:0 "Some shares in their largest corporations will wield us some influence."

 speerjapan.40.t:0 "They Ask for More"
 speerjapan.40.desc:0 "It was too good to be true, but we were still dismayed to find that the Germans were not satisfied with our rather one-sided investment proposal. Foreign Minister Schmidt cleared his throat to gain the attention of the conference room and began speaking powerfully.\n "Gentlemen. A mistake is being made here, regarding the profitability of these limited investments. Our countries will not be brought together, and neither of our economies will be benefited, unless we are to make a decisive treaty here. If Japan sends more of it's good investors to Germany, not only will Japanese investors make more money, but your Empire will reap the taxable benefits of this prosperity, and our firms will be encouraged to issue more stock. It is an exponential cycle, gentlemen, and both our great nations stand to benefit."\nMurmurs consumed our delegation all across the table. There was certainly opportunity to be had in increasing Japanese investments in the German economy: more profits, more influence, and improved diplomatic relations with the Germans for a start. The head of the delegation came to a decision:"
 speerjapan.40.a:0 ""You make a convincing case, Mr. Schmidt.""
 speerjapan.40.b:0 ""We do not trust your case, Mr. Schmidt.""

 speerjapan.41.t:0 "A Larger Investment Package?"
 speerjapan.41.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt took a sip from his glass of water and gently placed it down on the table. It had already been a long day of negotiating. But it appeared he wasn't finished for the day just yet. "Look. What we have agreed upon already is a great accomplishment. I strongly believe, however, that further Japanese investment into the Reich's infrastructure would be even more beneficial to both of our nations. Any risk you may perceive in such investments, I assure you, only exists in the immediate term as we continue our ongoing recovery efforts from the internal conflict. As the Reich continues to regain its footing and reclaim its spot as the world's foremost economy, any hint of doubt regarding our situation will rapidly fade away. And, of course, such great economic collaboration now is guaranteed to foster strong economic ties between our nations in the future and improve the Empire of Japan's image in the eyes of the German people... and investors."  \nReally? After the generous investment package that we had already offered, the German foreign minister asks Japan for more? The coy look on Schmidt's face provided no insight as to whether these investments would turn the easy profit he said they would. But it was possible he had a point... maybe there would be a substantial economic and diplomatic yield in the long run?"
 speerjapan.41.a:0 "There is no reason not to seize upon this opportunity."
 speerjapan.41.b:0 "We have given you enough already."

 speerjapan.42.t:0 "A Delicate Request"
 speerjapan.42.desc:0 "Before any deal could be finalized, it was important to ensure that the Co-Prosperity Sphere's internal security would not be impacted by restoring trade with the Germans. An uncomfortable but necessary request would have to be made. A quick phone call asking to initiate negotiations regarding a new issue quickly summoned Foreign Minister Schmidt back to the negotiating table. \n"Foreign Minister, there is actually one more issue we wish to discuss. As you are no doubt aware, Japan is currently dealing with certain... rebellious elements in Indonesia. We have reason to believe that there may be certain foreign influence in Japan's internal affairs, and we would like certain assurances from Germany that you are, erm, doing everything in your power to prevent aid from reaching these traitors. We ask that all German ships travelling through Co-Prosperity Sphere waters be submitted to cargo checks prior to entry. Understand that this is essential to the Sphere's internal security, Herr Schmidt." \nSchmidt replied, "Searching every single vessel to pass through the Sphere's territorial waters could greatly hurt our profit margins and slow down our shipping... Of course, I understand why you ask this of us." \nOf course the Germans would not be happy about having their shipping inhibited, but there was no other choice."
 speerjapan.42.a:0 "Let's see how he responds"

 speerjapan.43.t:0 "Another Counterproposal"
 speerjapan.43.desc:0 ""It would be very difficult for Germany to make sufficient profits on exports to the Co-Prosperity Sphere if a bottleneck is created in your shipping lanes. But we do acknowledge your internal security concerns. How about we make official inspections of all cargo ships before they leave Germany to ensure that no materials are being smuggled in order to undermine Japanese sovereignty? We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments." \nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. But of course he was just trying to protect his own country's interests. Still, that he would so boldly try to slip Germany out of these shipping inspections was a grave insult to the Japanese delegation. How could he understand the troublesome position the Japanese Empire was in? Actually, if he knew how bad things were in Indonesia, he might even gain the upper hand in the negotiations. We would be weak to back up on our initial demands now, but it is not out of the question if we really want to show the Germans our desire to work with them."
 speerjapan.43.a:0 "I suppose we can give them the benefit of the doubt."
 speerjapan.43.a:0 "No. Let us inspect your ships or kiss our investments goodbye."

 speerjapan.44.t:0 "A Ridiculous Counterproposal"
 speerjapan.44.desc:0 "The German foreign minister entered the room quietly, his face expressionless. Was he agitated about something? "I've received a proposal from our authorities to submit to you. In addition to performing our own cargo checks on shipping entering your waters, the Reich actually wishes to assist Japan in fending off American vessels sending aid to the Indonesian rebels. With our naval support, you can cover much more ground and more efficiently patrol for enemy supply ships." \nWas this some kind of sick joke? There was no way that the Germans were making this offer from the goodness of their hearts. Was there? Why on Earth would they offer their resources to protect Japanese waters? This was most likely a ploy to undermine Japan's security, and perhaps even to sneak through support to the Indonesian rebels themselves. The Japanese delegates sat silently, masking their rage and shock at hearing such a blatant diplomatic slap in the face. They did realize that Japan could in fact use the help that was being placed directly in front of them, but did they dare to assume that the Germans' audacious proposal was at all legitimate?"

Even a softening of Japan's deal became a worthy price to pay for detente and friendship with the Reich's old accomplice. Economic dependence was something that could be justified in return for security, trade, technological development and all the other merits that allies bring.

Have a lovely remainder of your evening, and we will continue tomorrow," replied Schmidt with a casual smile on his face. \nHe had done it! He had secured what was, to him, the most important thing for the German people: an actual source of stimulus for the economy! Schmidt had realized there had been no need to push the Japanese on even more investment when he'd already successfully pushed them to increase the size of their investment package. He couldn't have risked the livelihoods of the workers and families of Germany on trying to net more than he had even bargained for. \nUpon informing Speer of the sealed deal, the Führer even had to reply, "Well done, Schmidt." If even Speer was satisfied with his work, then Schmidt knew he had done more than well enough."

He had decided it was best to avoid provoking the Japanese delegation anymore after they had already agreed to allow Germany to check its own shipping before being sent to the Sphere. It would still slow down trade and hurt German profits, but it beat having ships being stopped for cargo checks in Japanese waters- that would have been a much worse bottleneck. \nEverything Schmidt did was in the name of improving the lives of the German people. If he had to make some concessions that would in the long run provide him more opportunities to help, then he would do it. Besides, the negotiations with the Japanese were far from over."

He didn't bother asking for any more than what had already been agreed upon, both because he didn't want to overreach and destroy the chance of any deal being signed, and because he didn't think he could stomach helping his or any country to make war more than he already had. \nThere was, however, no more time for Schmidt to ponder the morality of his actions. More negotiations with Japan would continue tomorrow, and maybe then he would get the chance to do something that would help instead of hurt the world."

There was no Kempeitai agent watching over his shoulder as he wrote his signature on the paper authorizing the secret weapons shipments and beginning of RND operations in support of the Indonesian rebels fighting the Japanese Empire.\nOnce he had finished signing the document and submitted it, Schmidt felt both incredibly relieved but somehow still awfully tense. He knew he was doing the right thing. Any help he could give to those who were bravely fighting against Japan's fascist hegemony over Asia was something to be proud of.\nSadly, Japan was enforcing a strict system of inspecting all German shipping entering the Sphere's waters, but sneaking a few small ships through with arms and RND agents was still doable.

This was exactly why Schmidt had suggested to Speer and the RND that only a few small, isolated black sites were set up across Indochina so that there was no way the Japanese would ever find them.\nSchmidt scanned the document nervously and let out a large sigh of relief. All of the planned sites had been smoothly created after the RND agents had secretly landed on various desolate beaches across the vast jungles of the region. Due to the caution that had been employed, they were disconnected and poorly supplied, but this was much better than nothing.\nNow he had to sit back and wait as the reports on the RND's activity gradually came in over the coming months.

We'd simply like you to reaffirm that you're not forgoing any of our pre-existing agreements and that you're not giving any special or preferable treatment to the Japanese."\n\n"Oh, is that what this is about? You can tell my friends in the White House they have absolutely nothing to worry about. Our new administration is simply opening the Reich up again to all sorts of foreign partnership opportunities. The Germany of isolation and conquest is no more, and that's all there is to it, Ambassador."

Lowering tariffs too much might mean that many newly established German companies might not be able to compete with the low prices of the massive Japanese corproations, causing many to go bankrupt.

erhardnomics.1.t:0 "Kartellgesetz"
erhardnomics.1.d:0 "Cigar smoke wafted strongly in the room as Ludwig Erhardt flicked open a lighter to continue the trend of making it just a bit more difficult to breathe in the room. In front of the man with a plan sat, reading over a document, the Führer himself - Albert Speer. He had been holding a hand to the side of his head, occasionally stopping up to gaze at a certain piece of text before either sighing or rubbing his forehead and continuing. "Herr Erhard," the old Führer began, looking up at the Minister who seemed to look just a little bit happier when they met eye-to-eye. "This law of yours... the Kartellgesetz. How do you propose we push this through? After all, the most affected would be the four biggest companies in Germania. And...", "And what, my Führer?" Erhard calmly shot back, puffing the cigar and pulling it out of his mouth. "What would they do about it? Complain? Certainly, they would," Erhard stopped up, blowing out some smoke and taking another puff, "but consider this. They would practically be admitting to keeping each other in business in a big charade. And that..."\n\nA small grin approached his lips. "That wouldn't reflect so well on the 'Aryan' spirit, now would it?" He said, almost seeming to be mocking the notion of such a thing. Speer glared at him as if Erhard just gutted an animal in front of him, but eventually took a deep breath, and then an even deeper sigh. "If you would be so kind as to listen," he strained, subconsciously pressing a thumb down on the document, "I can tell you that they have tools at their disposal. Allies. Influence. If we begin with something like this, then we run the risk of..."\n\nErhard chuckled, shutting the Führer up quickly. Throwing the used-up cigar out into a nearby trash bin, he simply crossed his arms and shook his head. "Hostility? Yes, but this is the easiest way to begin approaching them. If you don't want the Reich to be dominated by giant corporations that effectively run the state for you, my Führer, then I suggest that you take my suggestion, or I'm afraid that my ideas end here." Speer wanted to say something. Something that could turn the case against Erhard, but there was nothing. If he hadn't had a medical check-up recently, he swore he could've felt an aneurysm coming. "And believe me, my Führer, I have a lot more than just the dismantlement of cartels in mind."\n\nThe old minister's gaze sharpened, and Speer felt like he could read exactly what the man had in mind."
erhardnomics.1.a:0 "What have I gotten myself into..."

erhardnomics.2.t:0 "The Reich's Needs"
erhardnomics.2.d:0 ""My Führer..." Erhard began, splaying his fingers out across the map of Europe, pointer finger placed on the heart of the Reich. "I understand that you have some incessant need to plunder the countries you control, but all that would lead into is a slow deterioration of relationships with the other Zollverein members." He looked up towards Speer, and saw the glint in his eyes. This wasn't good.\n\n"Herr Erhard, you should understand the main principle of this union between countries. It has never-" Erhard felt like he wanted to put a rip on the paper right where the capital was- "A benevolent, equal partnership." Speer put both of his hands on the table and looked down, then splayed one over the territories beyond the Reich. "These are territories we have conquered all fair and well in a war that we started. If there is anyone to be determining who gets what, it shall be us." The minister licked his lips. He could've gone for a drink right about now. "Is that really it, my Führer? Just a sentimental want to..." There was no way Speer could have believed in only that, could he? "... My Führer, I hope you have a very good reason to stick to this tenant of National Socialism. The only road this can take is down."\n\nSpeer took his hands off the table and clasped them behind him. "I don't know what you want to hear out of me, Herr Erhard, regarding this issue. I believe there never was an issue to begin with. The members of the Zollverein may not be happy about it, but they have nowhere else to turn to. In the end, they can only return to the Reich." Erhard swallowed, taking concentrated breaths. "What is it that you want me to do now, then, my Führer?" He asked, nearly failing to conceal the anger in his voice. "Isn't it obvious?" He rhetorically asked. "I want you to alert Herr Kiesinger that the Reich's policy remains the same.""

erhardnomics.3.d:0 "The smoke that came into his view while staring through his binoculars confused him for a second before he realized that, no, Warsaw wasn't burning, that was just the cigar in his mouth. Still, he was surprised that Speer rounded up enough political capital to get this many men out and this much equipment. Perhaps it was simply the sheer obviousness of his arguments? Erhard chuckled softly when he remembered how Speer tried to argue against reinvesting into Warsaw and Kyiv. Something vague about the Reich expressing strength by showing the Poles and Ukrainians that resistance was meaningless, but even then Erhard could have seen that he wasn't really believing the argument himself.\n\nNo - what was more likely was that Speer was a snake who thought that he could give a minimal damn about making the Reich seem to be more than just the crushing iron grip of Europa that needed to be removed. He was no National Socialist, certainly, but he could see sense to reason. Or perhaps he did, but was too afraid of the clutches of democracy? Erhard found that both funny and frustrating, but before he could continue looking at the construction project mobilizing men and equipment, he felt a shake on his shoulder.\n\n"Herr Erhard," the voice said, and it took him a moment to process that it was actually the project manager. Lowering his binoculars and turning his head, he raised an eyebrow. "Yes?", "If I may ask, why Warsaw and Kyiv?" It didn't take him long to respond as he shook his head. "Besides being potential industrial heartlands? Well, I suppose there's another reason for it. These are some of the most hardest hit areas of Generalplan Ost, and starting here could perhaps earn us the goodwill of the non-Germans living in these areas." He could feel the cold gaze of the manager on him, only tamed by the fact that he was much higher up than the man. "Well?" Erhard started up again, returning his own glare. "Are you staring at me? Zoning out, perhaps?" He continued, voice filling with irritation and sarcasm. The manager gave him no response, seemingly confused and worried by Erhard's words. "So? You're not? Out with it, then! Is it something you wish to say? Or do you perhaps have nothing to tell me?" He could see the manager visibly swallow. "Then go! You have a project to be overseeing, don't you? Oversee it!"\n\nIt took Erhard a solid minute to calm down after he left. What was he even thinking, starting dialogue with a man like that?"

But now they were here, Erhard drinking a small glass with strong alcohol while Schmidt was more modest, deciding on some wine instead. With a pleasant sigh, the minister of the economy spoke. "The resignation trick works every time. Really, I wasn't expecting him to be so asinine about it. It's like I was asking him to instate elections." Schmidt let out a short laugh. "No, God no, if it was like that I think he'd ask you to resign instead." Erhard himself chuckled, and would have reached for a cigar had that not been allowed in the restaurant.\n\n"I suppose, however, that you can tell me more details about this plan of yours?" Schmidt asked, prompting Erhard to sober up a little and listen to what the Foreign Minister had to say. "Yes," Erhard began, nodding. "It's quite simple, it's just that the plan will take a long time to implement. I'm aiming for Germany's colonies to industrialize sufficiently, you see." Schmidt nodded. "If we want them to stand as partners, they can't be so reliant on the old home that any economic crises would make them buckle and crack, just as it happened in the fifties. Instead, you're going to, with my help, turn all of those colonies into shining, rich jewels. Not on par with Germany itself, but at least enough to be a little self sufficient."\n\nSchmidt nodded again - this time more clearly satisfied. A smile graced his lips as he spoke. "But what of the consequences? What if they demand independence?", "We'll give it to them," Erhard stated flatly. "Eventually. If Speer isn't a fool, he'll let us build the base to feasibly stop exploiting them. If he is a fool, however..." Erhard sighed."

erhardnomics.5.d:0 ""Think, my Führer," Erhard started, turning his head away to blow smoke through a window. "Consider the consequences of forcing the Zollverein to remain dominant of the Reich. If we do that, all we're setting ourselves up for is a future failure of our sphere." His words stung cruelly, and Speer relented on uttering a swear before turning to look to Helmut Schmidt. "And you?" Speer asked, voice tightened somewhat. Schmidt nodded politely, then showed a hand towards Erhard. "He's right, my Führer. If we decide not to liberalize the Zollverein, then we'd be running the risk of eventually turning the members turning against us. Just look at Japan and its sphere as an example. The tensions between the members and Japan are palpable."\n\nWas Speer really hearing this? Now two out of the four members of the Gang were nearly directly coercing him into following through with their demands. And if he decided to raise a voice? Protest? Then only the obvious would have followed. Letting the air in the room stay thin for a few seconds more, he finally decided to speak. "Erhard." He stated, turning his gaze to the man. "Let's say we do liberalize the Zollverein. In the future, what's to stop them from dreaming about detaching themselves from the Reich? To pursue a light at the end of the tunnel? After all, if we are so benevolent now, then the implication would be that we can continue this benevolence for the future. And this... would not bode well for the Reich."\n\nErhard's eyes narrowed, and his teeth grazed against the skin of the cigar just a little bit harder. Taking it out his mouth, he sighed. "My Führer, you have it backwards. I understand that you hold a more traditionalist position on this, but it doesn't mean that everyone that isn't Ge-- the Reich, is unreasonable. But for exactly the reason you initially described is why they would not leave us." Speer leaned back, stare softening only slightly. "After all, what do they gain out of leaving a mutually-beneficial partnership? Pride?" Erhard shook his head. "They already lost that a while ago. They would have only to gain by staying, and nothing by losing. This," he paused, taking a puff of his cigar, "Would only happen if you let this reform pass." An air of silence passed between them for many seconds. Both men in front of the Führer wondered what he planned on staying-- before he pushed his chair back and stood up. The expression on his face spoke a thousand words."

A company that serves as a true testament to Abs' profit-driven motives, and the costs that come with it.\n\nIG Farben is a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate. On a surface level, it is nothing more than a megacorporation, pulling its strings across all of the Reich, its colonies, and further abroad than that. Under the helm of Hermann Josef Abs, it has risen to become one of the most powerful actors within the government, not only having wide scale influence in large parts of the Unity-Pakt, but fielding their own private mercenary company, as well as a heavy, if not total, reliance on brutal slave labor. Having reaped the rewards of a victorious Reich, Abs has certified his reputation of what it is to be successful as a German. Out and active, he has crafted a carefully-made image of an apolitical yet loyal businessman, serving the interests of the Reich.\n\nYet under the guise of an honorable and capable man lies a bloody history driven by a single desire. Hermann Josef Abs, under the wraps, is an incredibly cunning and ruthless man. It can be safely claimed that his economic empire stretches from sea to shining sea, and that his business acumen remains one of the most unrivalled in the whole world. His reach extends to every continent, and IG Farben only remains to be one of the many companies under his repertoire, with many more scattered around the world.\n\nIn the homeland, however, is where Abs makes his capital, and something can clearly be said about IG Farben and its shadow ruler - it is a threat. A threat not only politically and economically, but morally as well. It stands as a testament of success to relying on slave labor-- an idea unworkable in the long run, yet here it stood as a shining jewel in a pile of riches. If Erhard is to collapse this rotten structure from the inside out, all his genius would be for naught if not firstly invested into the largest threat that stands before him. A titan which will force Germany to bend under a system that cannot hold forever.\n\nHermann Josef Abs is a force."

While the rest are brutally unforgiving slave holders run by power-hungry rulers, Ernst von Siemens is a strange case. He is more far-seeing than his competition, relying on advanced industries that naturally use little slave labor. It comes as no surprise, then, when Erhard believes that out of all the megacorps dominating Germany, Siemens stands out as the sole exception of a company that doesn't have to be fully dismantled. In fact, quite the opposite. If the minister played his cards right, he could potentially get a powerful ally on his side.\n\nBut that's not to say that they're completely innocent. Ernst von Siemens has gotten his way to the top, after all, which does not mean he relied purely on honest business practices and sheer skill. Instead, it has signed into a contract with every other factory to form cartels. Now placing themselves in a position where they can remain untouchable by anyone who isn't as wholly massive as they are, the Siemens empire prospers greatly at the top, and it isn't quite certain how they will react once Erhard begins his plans.

When the sergeant went up to announce to the guards that the factory was being seized, that's when he spotted it. They weren't normal security guards. They wore a set of all-too-familiar clothing, and a bullet struck his combat helmet before he dropped to the ground and yelled into his radio that a firefight had begun.\n\nIt wasn't a very long firefight. Half an hour later, and the noise had died down into a strange silence. "Men? Report casualties." The radio crackled back soon after.\n\n"Sir, we have two dead and five wounded." He felt a pang of anger strike his heart. "Goddamn SS," he muttered, turning over one with his boot to see the symbol of the Schutzstaffel emblazoned on his chest. "Of all the companies in the world, these traitors employ these assholes." Spitting on the man's red-tinted shirt, he opened up the radio channel again. "How many slaves are wounded, soldier?" He asked, and the reply he got unnerved him, even if he didn't care much about the slaves. "It's a bloodbath in here, sir. It seems like the SS started firing on the slaves after they initiated a firefight with us. It's... there's not many of them left, sir.""

No, now that was going to be a thing of the past, something to be looked at in shame. At least, he hoped that's how history would treat it. Whatever road it would go didn't matter in the moment, however, as he looked over an analysis of who owned what in the Unity-Pakt.\n\nA chuckle escaped his lips as he took a puff from his cigar. Before, entire regions of Germany and its partners would be shaded in solid colours, but now? Now only one colour dominated the battlefield, and those four megacorporations that were left were reduced to nothing but small dots and sometimes even stripes to indicate conflicted ownership. Staring at the map for a moment longer, Erhard nodded to himself. With his economics plan put into full force, he knew that the people - and, most importantly, the middle class - would thrive from this change of pace.\n\nWhen Erhard eventually left his office, he took a slight detour and made sure to pass where Speer was currently residing, just to take a look at the man's expression. With only a quick stop by the door, he could glance at the man shuffling papers, his face showing only uncertainty. Erhard felt satisfied with what he saw, and left before Speer could notice the minister laying about. With another puff of the cigar, Erhard smiled to himself."

Now he could do it knowing that he wouldn't have something looming over his mind as he did. The vehicle in question was Mercedez-Benz W108 vehicle. It was a few years old at this point, and there were other choices available to him, but this car struck him out as pleasing to the eye, and, as he rode in the streets of Germania, felt the quality of its build on the concrete streets. These cars weren't built with trembling slave hands. Instead the design was constructed by a healthy, paid German, one who specifically studied and prepared for that sort of job.\n\nNot only that, this car he bought did not come from some far-reaching company that employed millions upon millions of slaves. Instead, it was by a factory sold off to a middle-class family at the behest of the government. And to really drive the point home, Erhard made sure that anything built by German hands alone would be specifically marked as being such. If his plan blossomed fully, that would mean that eventually, that label would apply to every German product.\n\nStepping out of the car in the parking lot, Erhard looked over the vehicle once again. This could be sold abroad, even - fall into the hands of an American family that could appreciate German technicality repurposed for more benevolent means. He was almost certain that Speer would look at him with a worried expression if he said that out loud, but at least he would consider the proposal of exporting German goods to beyond just the Unity-Pakt\n\nWith the theorizing done with, Erhard began his service of the Reich that morning.

For what he lacks in size, Flick makes up for it by cutting through the stock market and working company-owned slaves for every last drop of blood. He is merciless, and a prime example of a Nazi brought into the modern generation. But that is not why he is so dangerous.\n\nIn Erhard's eyes, being connected to the black heart of Europe known as Ordenstaat-Burgund is already a horrific sin. Flick, however, goes above and beyond that, being a man who has direct ties to the abomination that leads the whole project - Heinrich Himmler. Not only that, but Erhard knows that he has directly supported the cause of the SS with monetary compensation. And so, in order to further the Einheitspakt of the devilish ideology known as the Burgundian System, Erhard must strike hard at Friedrich Flick and his empire."

speer.500.d:0 ""Gentlemen, a toast!"\n\nGlasses clinked together as Erhard let out a chuckle. Then, from the group of five, it was the most powerful Wehrwirtschaftsführer, Hermann Josef  Abs, who spoke. "Say, then, Herr Erhard," he began, cutting into his finely-made steak. "The tide turns strongly, doesn't it? In just a few years short, we've gone from our old Führer to something fresh and exciting." Another, Friedrich Flick, the Wehrwirtschaftsführer of Daimler-Benz, shot him a glare, but Abs merely ignored it.\n\n"Oh," Erhard began, downing a shot glass. "I agree. I like our new direction. Now, if I may call to attention why I brought you all here in the first place." All eyes landed on Erhard - from Abs, to Flick, to the silent Edmund Geilenberg and the curious Ernst von Siemens. "As you're aware, the Speer administration will be doing a multitude of things. Reforming the army, strengthening the economy, loosening up diplomacy, and maybe laxing a few laws of old here and there. That's all well and good, but my personal interests lies in the problem that's faced Germany for decades. I'm sure you all know what that is."\n\nThe air seemed to still around them. Geilenberg spoke first. "I will hazard a guess that this is about the slaves." He bluntly stated, and Erhard's smile merely grew. "Correct, my friend. All of your companies-" Abs' steady supply of smoke from his cigar stopped. "-... well, to make it easy to understand, they're going to be dismantled." The group collectively tensed up, and while Siemens was the least tense, Flick seemed like he was on the verge of rage. "I knew I shouldn't have come here!" He shouted, kicking away his chair and standing up. "This folly of ruining my business. Erhard, I won't let you take away a percentage of my workforce! Not when I have anything to say about it!" Erhard took a single puff of his own cigar and crushed it into the tray. Leaning forward, he grinned, and the rest remained deathly quiet as he spoke."

So when they met, it was during a walk in the Volkshalle, traversing the cold, long and massive halls of that place as they spoke.\n\n"Go over your plan again, will you?" Speer asked, and Kiesinger found it simple to oblige.\n\n"It's a several-step plan. In no particular order, I would like to deal three issues. First, it is difficult to keep conquests held, especially if it is from people that hold contempt from us. Wouldn't you agree?" He asked, and Speer gave a wary nod. "I propose a solution. We can either reform the Reichskommissariats into natively-organized collaborationist governments, or turn them into Reichsländers. These would be a more... seperate-but-equal deal. Not preferable, and potentially unstable, though it would please the conservatives."\n\n"Go on." Speer said, flicking open his lighter for a cigarette. "The other two problems?" Kiesinger nodded. "The second is the issue of slavery. It's killing us, and we'll need to tackle it carefully. That is a plan I will draw on later, but all of us must cooperate on it. The last is dealing with the economy. Besides the megacorporations, we'll have to revive businesses and..." Speer's face contorted into slight annoyance. "Speak with Erhard. I'm aware, my Führer. Don't worry, however. I know how to deal with him." Speer let out a sigh. "So that's your plan, then? In that case, I advise you begin as soon as possible.\n\nKiesinger smiled. "Of course, my Führer.

speer.502.d:0 "In the early 1940s, with our war industry unable to rally enough hands to maintain supply of new goods and equipment, we turned to the one resource we had in quantity that remained unspent: flesh. Millions of prisoners - untermenschen, POWs, political enemies - occupied the concentration camps, being worked to death or starved to no end beyond extermination. As Armaments Minister, Albert Speer gave them a different fate entirely: to work, day and night and unto death, in the German war machine. Rather than breaking rocks and being tortured at the whim of SS guards, they would work the forges and assemble tools of death for the Wehrmacht.\n\nIt seemed like a good idea at the time. Most men of fighting age were enlisted or conscripted to fight the plutocratic democracies of the West or the Bolshevik menace of the East. With women relegated to more appropriate roles, we were in desperate need for hands - any hands - in our factories. Without the mass employment of forced labor, we could not have produced the mountain of armaments that allowed us to crush our foes with an ease that no capitalist economy could have matched. Slave-forged tanks, guns and planes were as essential to our victory as strong German souls.\n\nHowever, slavery has grown completely out of control. No longer constrained by the state, our industrial leaders have developed a monopoly on the use of slavery, locking most of the German populace out of blue-collar jobs. Even agriculture has no room for free workers, as Prussian land magnates rent tens of thousands of slaves on the cheap from corporations like Reichswerke and IG Farben. For this plague on the Reich to end, the power of the megacorporations must be permanently broken and the deprived masses set free - no matter the cost."

The more ground we give, the more we legitimize it, and that's the one thing we must avoid at all costs. They'll expect a dozen concessions for every single man and woman set free. We can't have any of that. If Speer doesn't have the backbone to go for their throats, we'll do it ourselves."\n\nKiesinger looked equally bemused and weary. "I can't help but notice you've already turned this into a joint effort on our part, Ludwig. Remember that if one of us goes down, so does the entire cabinet."\n\nErhard stubbed out his cigar in the fancy brass ashtray on his desk and smirked grimly. "That's exactly the idea behind this push. Remember, we still have a dictator on our side. Yes, this will kill relations between the state and industrial leaders, but that's what we want. Speer has already made himself quite popular, and if we can make a true abolitionist out of him, the people will never forget it. From there, the downfall of Abs and his clique will be set in stone.

"Well, my Führer, they were designed to your specifications. I'm sure the fine young men in the propaganda ministry are doing their jobs as best they can."\n\n"I'll ignore that comment, Parteikanzler," Speer muttered as he glanced disparagingly at a particularly unconvincing poster. "I mean, really - look at this." He slammed one down on his desk and threw the rest of them over his shoulder, temper exhausted. It was a photograph, showing a smiling, far too well-fed man in the striped pyjamas of a concentration camp inmate shaking hands with an equally jubilant and healthy-looking bureaucrat in full Party uniform. 'From Masters and Slaves to Brothers and Friends' was stenciled on the bottom in bold, yellow lettering.\n\n"It is a bit on the nose," conceded Kiesinger. "But it's a hard sell, my Führer. It is slavery, after all."\n\nSpeer shook his head. "No, Kiesinger, I told you: they're not 'slaves'. They're 'foreign workers' or 'involuntary laborers'. We have to make sure our narrative stays consistent."\n\nKiesinger sighed. "Apologies, my Führer, but there's no sense playing with semantics. They are what they are. It's a bitter pill that the entire nation will have to swallow at some point."\n\nThe Führer looked lost. God only knew, his subordinate thought, what could be running through the back-channels of his conflicted mind. "Fine," he said after several seconds' silence.

speer.505.d:0 "After a great deal of debate - often fuelled by alcohol and conducted in a haze of cigar smoke - the Führer and his cabinet have finalized the solution to the long-standing question of slavery. As anyone knows, the approximately 40 million slaves in the Reich cannot simply be granted manumission en masse and set free. That would result in little more than social and economic chaos across Europe, along with a great deal of bloodshed.\n\nThe first and most pressing concern is of course the nationalization of slavery. As long as slaves remain private property, they remain vulnerable to excessive exploitation and the whims of uncaring industrial corporations. Placing them under the exclusive stewardship of the Reich Government will ensure that they are well protected and given more humane treatment - an important step in rehabilitating our image as a more benevolent empire.\n\nThe second step is repatriation. The overwhelming majority of slaves are Slavs, predominantly of Polish and Ukrainian origin. Thankfully, we have extensive records of the slave system and can track each and every one of them. Starting shortly after their nationalization, the slaves will begin to be organized and sent back to the countries of origin in a steady stream. Though slow at first, we expect this 'Rückführungsprogramm' to pick up speed as the freed slaves become more cooperative and see that our intentions are true."

With no more wars to fight and no possibility of advancing through the ranks, Herr Weber was forced to try his luck in the blue-collar job market. That, as most of the populace could tell you, was a futile endeavour.\n\n"I hadn't realized during the war," Weber recalled, "That the corporations on the home front would be so exploitative and cruel. I wholly believed in the Führer's promise that they were at his beck and call. Perhaps they were for a time, but when I returned home they had no work to offer. Not for myself, my family or my friends. Two men from my unit - men who had lived through both Barbarossa and the West Russian War - committed suicide because they could find no purpose in their daily lives once the Wehrmacht no longer needed them. Their old employer had been bought out by IG Farben in the early 50s."\n\nAs I spoke to him recently, I never would have thought that his life was ever so difficult. A few years ago, Herr Weber was living off the pittance that his pension would grant him; now, he is a proud greengrocer who runs his own business (pictured below). Here, he sells fresh produce from local farms, turning enough of a profit that he was recently able to purchase a home for his family. They now live in a modest but splendid country home just outside of Stuttgart.\n\n"Of course, I owe all of this to the new Führer," Weber told me with a smile. "I don't really understand economics, but whatever he's done has already given me a life that I'd given up on long ago.

"Good, good. That'll feed into the economic side of things. Great thinking. As for my own field... I think this round of reforms will be a lot more difficult than the last one."\n\n"The megacorporations, yes," replied Kiesinger. "They certainly won't make our endeavour easier, that much is certain." The Parteikanzler smiled knowingly as he sipped his Franconian wine. "I'm sure you had a plan of attack drawn up years ago, though."\n\nErhard chuckled, downing his cutlery. "Well, naturally. It just makes sense to have contingency plans, doesn't it? I doubt even Herr Hitler could fault me for that. You see, I-"\n\nKiesinger held up a hand. "Just the shorthand version, Ludwig. Economics isn't my forte."\n\nThe old economist rolled his eyes.

The madman counting trees. He wondered if a Russian leader had found some humor in the same idea he found just now.\n\nHe eventually stood up, walked around his desk, and out of his office, absentmindedly going through the corridors of the Chancellery, thinking about the things he and his government were free to do now that those people of the likes of Schörner would finally be out of here.\n\nHe stopped by a portrait of Adolf Hitler, studying him in a more civilian attire. The Fuhrer once looked up to him, owing him for the opportunities given to him. He earned much from what Hitler did.

"Simply put: we need the Mittelstand back. Small- and medium-sized businesses were the bedrock of the German economy right up until Hitler started handing out government contracts to the Party's biggest donors. We all know how that turned out. We've put a lot of effort into building a middle class - they'll be crucial to our new policies. We have to rely on the established corporation as little as possible from now on. Don't issue them new contracts, don't engage with them, don't indulge their requests."\n\nSpeer paused for a moment.

Immediately, the new alliance prepared to defend against what would later become the Unity-Pakt. All mountain borders, from the Balkans to the Pyrenees, were fortified, but none so much as the Alps: the frontier between the Italian Empire and what was once Austria is a single, gargantuan fortification spanning more than two hundred kilometers. Bunkers, pillboxes, trenches and sheltered walkways dot the Dolomiti, and while the icy peaks may seem pristine to the casual observer, they hide deep underground galleries and ammunition depots, and anti-aircraft positions encased onto the mountains. Like a cursed mirror reflecting the evil within the hearts of men, identical defences can be seen on the German side.\n\nIn the end, the German attack never came, as the Reich collapsed under its own weight like a clay-footed goliath, but the fortifications remained, and even now, thousands of Italians and Germans look at each other from the ramparts, the ingenuity of such fortifications only surpassed by the hate they were built with, as if the very concrete echoed the feelings of betrayal and anger of the Italian people."

Why did he agree to such onslaught? If not for the sake of working with the Gang of Four, he never would have wasted time in such an endeavor, one which will most likely end in failure. Still, he has been dragged inside this mess, and now he has to help his Minister against an enemy who wields diplomacy with the same skill their ancestors in the Italian city-states did centuries before: one third high culture and fine wines, another one charisma and sharp words, and the final third daggers and poison hidden behind a smile.\n\nPutting down the report, he reaches for the phone and enters the number. After a few seconds, an overly-eager voice answers: "Your Excellency, what an unexpected call! What can I do for you?" to which the Führer replies: "Ambassador Chenaux-Repond, I call you for that matter you mentioned to Reichsminister Schmidt last week. The Reich would be interested in expanding Swiss banking operation within Brandenburg, but in exchange, I have to ask you to act as a mediator in our current diplomatic talks with the Italian Empire" immediately comes the answer: "I will inform the Federal Council of your most generous offer at once, Your Excellency. Please wait until tomorrow" and then the call ends."

speer.516.d:0 "As our delegation has agreed to grant concessions to the Italians in the future treaties between our countries, now we face internal indecision on the actual size of such concessions, as the various factions within the government try to convince the Führer.\n\nReichsminister Schmidt and his followers agree that we should show the full extent of our good will, and try to convince the Italians that we truly want to build an entirely new relationship with them. The conservatives, on the other hand, refuse to humiliate the Reich by granting the Italian Empire the upper hand, and insist for token concessions which will nonetheless please their delegation. Finally, the Führer himself is trying to act as a mediator, and could find a middle ground in substantial concessions, but nothing major.\n\nStill, the arguments from all sides are very convincing: the matter is now in the leader's hands, in what direction will the helmsman decide to steer his ship?"

Their homes, too. The Bohemian Orpo reported seeing Schmidt in Prague this morning, but nothing more. Herr Gehlen has suggested that they've fled the country after..." he cleared his throat. "After the direction your last conversation took."\n\nSpeer could barely force himself to speak. "You are dismissed," he mumbled. As the secretary left his office, the enormity of the blow struck the Führer like a hammer in the gut. The Gang of Four was no more. Just like that, they had walked away from his grand project, from the promise of a better future for the Reich. There would be no more economic reform, no more charming the NSDAP, no more keeping the Wehrmacht in line and no more hope for positive relations with the rest of the world. It didn't seem real. Surely it couldn't end like this?\n\nHis phone rang, startling him out of his fugue state. He paused for a moment before lifting the receiver to his ear and steadying his voice. "Hello?"\n\n"My Führer," came the gravelly, condescending voice of Hermann Josef Abs. "I hear you're in need of some assistance with your economic policy.

erhardgo4.1.d:0 "Smoke had long since displaced any clean air in the room, despite the cracked windows. The meeting had overshot its expected length by over an hour, and Erhard showed no signs of stopping the torrent of figures that somehow poured from his mouth while he chewed his cigar. Even those with more of a head for figures had begun to tune out - Speer's eyes glanced towards the others seated at the table. The various hangers-on were frantically flicking through papers, trying to keep up.  Kiesinger was doing his best to appear interested but Albert recognised the glassy look in his eyes. Reichsminister Schmidt was making his own way through the tome Erhard had provided, tilting his head and nodding at some paragraph incomprehensible to human eyes. The Führer redirected his attention back to the economist as he seemed to be coming to the end of some point.\n\n"...tax exceptions and exemptions abolished, tax deductions reduced drastically, and the implementation of a true fixed rate income tax."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows raised at this sentence. "You know as well as I do that our industry relies on those tax breaks, Friedrich. The Reichswerke reinvested half of what they saved on new equipment this year. How much are you proposing for this tax?" \n\nReichsminister Erhard took another drag of his cigar, worked it about his mouth and exhaled across the table. "Forty percent." \nAt that, slumped necks straightened and eyes refocused. Speer coughed, and not because of the smoke. "That's... ridiculous." he settled on, unable to think of a better word. "IG Farben alone will have my head. They've been paying less than twenty since the war." \n\nFriedrich didn't appear ruffled, just inhaled more smoke. "Ridiculous it may seem, mein Führer, but I can assure you it is quite sound. The people have been holding the burden of taxation for decades. Regressive tax policies may expand industries, but they have become bloated. Forcing the industrial conglomerates to pay what they owe while allowing the people to spend more will force a new equilibrium, one they'll appreciate far more than those fat slaving bastards at Farben did."\n\nThe Führer once again took stock of the room. Schmidt's eyes had brightened, and his nods turned from the paper to Speer. Generalfeldmarshall von Tresckow looked sceptical but kept his thoughts to himself. Deputy Führer Kiesinger leaned over to Schmidt, hoping to glean some of his knowledge."

erhardgo4.2.d:0 ""Telephone for you, mein Führer." \n\nSpeer glanced up, ready to deliver a rebuke at being interrupted mid sentence, before he realised he had been expecting this call. There were few others who could demand a conversation with the Führer in this manner. He sighed, and gestured for the phone. The ministers sat about the table looked variously confused and intrigued - save for Erhard. He simply leaned forward in his chair. \n\nSpeer held the receiver to his ear. "Speaking."\n\n"Mein Führer," the voice drawled, barely pronouncing the honorific before turning to business. "I'm sure these new tax rates haven't escaped your attention. They must be corrected at once." \n\n IG Farben may have been the biggest name on Herr Abs' business card but it would certainly be pressed for space. Close to fifty of the Reich's largest businesses boasted him on their board of directors. Few others could speak to Speer so brusquely. \n\n The Führer looked down at the tax papers that decorated the table this very moment. He wasn't remotely surprised they'd leaked, considering the magnitude of IG Farben's influence. "Hermann. You called at an ideal time." Not a hint of sarcasm showed on his face, though a hint of a smirk tugged at Erhard's lip. "We were going through the plans, and your input would be appreciated."\n\n"Then you can sweep them off your desk. You know damned well what those tax breaks do for us, and you can be sure everyone in my phone book will know they're going by the end of the day." The phone went dead. \n\nReichsminister Erhard chuckled. It seemed like he didn't need to know what Abs had said. "If I may mein Führer, I don't think it necessary to respond. The opinion of a man like him is not something you need to worry about.""

He had directed his Ministry to spend the last week gathering this data - Gauleiters did not appreciate intrusion into their affairs, preferring to think of themselves more as lords to be left to their own. Once gathered it was just as monumental a task to sort through, but for the knowledge he gained he would pay any price. \n\nThe Führer had proved more easily moved than he had expected. Perhaps he was sincere after all - one does not ignore the richest man in the Reich on a whim. The numbers didn't lie, and while there had been a short term income drop it had been more than made up for by the sudden and vast flow of currency between the hands of the Reich's citizens. One Mark is not one Mark but many, holding value for every transaction it is used in, and taking the money out of the pockets of men like Hermann Josef Abs was a good deed in itself. They could complain, but if things kept going this way their oligopolies would be on the way out. "

The economy will bounce back, people will spend more, small business will become profitable once again! What hold does he have over you, damnit?"\n\nAlbert recalled a moment, back as Minister of Armaments and War Production. He had to fight to hold the position of course - Hitler didn't tolerate anyone who couldn't carve out their own sphere. It required ambition and ruthlessness. The first, he had known he had. The second, not so much.\n\n"I've heard excellent things, Herr Speer. Your designs for the camps have been most impressive." \n\n"Thank you, Herr Himmler. The true trouble was acquiring more workers, of course, but Sauckel has proven most resourceful. If events proceed as planned, we should see upwards of a million voluntary labourers from the east. Of course we will require more.""

erhardgo4.5.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Flat Income Tax"
erhardgo4.5.d:0 ""What the fuck do you mean he did it anyway?" A vein throbbed in the Führer's forehead. His grip on the telephone tightened. Kiesinger quietly took in the office until Speer gave an exasperated sigh and put down the phone with more force than was necessary. \n\n"Erhard has announced this tax plan of his to half the damned Reichstag."\n\nAs the Führer leaned back in his chair, Kurt commented "Ludwig is like a dog with a bone with these things, but this is far even for him." \n\nSpeer rubbed at his eyes. "Economists are more trouble than they're worth. The whole economy is more trouble than it's worth. Tell them it's cancelled, tell them it was a spy, I don't care, just shut him up before he does any more damage." \n\n"Albert... I'll admit I was sceptical, but this plan of his has merit. People need this kind of change, and reining him in now may be far more trouble than it's worth. And men like Abs need kicking down."Speer's mind flicked back, fifteen years perhaps? The Volkshalle dome, his magnum opus. Twenty companies selling materials. Four selling people - Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs. Abs had shares in every one of them. How many were buried in foundations?"
erhardgo4.5.a:0 "Perhaps there is method to his madness."

erhardgo4.6.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Flat Income Tax"
erhardgo4.6.d:0 ""Then I'll resign." \n\n"That won't be necessary." \n\n"You mistake me, Albert. I WILL resign, if you do not back this plan. You would prefer to deal with Abs? One of the greatest slave owners in human history? Fuck him." A scowl had built on Erhard's face, and he ground his cigar out into the ashtray. \n\nSpeer blinked. An ugly look built behind his eyes. "The hell are you talking about? I am your Führer. You do not resign without my say so. You do not do anything without my say so. You will fix this." The Führer spat the last sentence. The other around the table glanced about - it was only the inner circle now. Erhard was at the opposite end of the long table for once. Kiesinger and Schmidt sat in the centre, opposite another. They were each alternating glances between the economist and their Führer. Generalfeldmarshall von Tresckow stood by the window smoking a cigarette. \n\n"I am fixing this. I am trying to fix the mess of the past 20 years of mismanagement. And if you won't let me do that, I don't know why the hell any of us are here."\n\nKiesinger and Schmidt had both raised their heads, but it was von Tresckow who spoke first. "He's right." Henning paused, giving Speer and Erhard a chance to break their locked gaze. "You're here because people believe the Reich should be different. If you don't give them that - if they think you are just like Bormann, or Göring? You'll be swinging from a gibbet with the rest of us."\n\nThe normally turbulent atmosphere of the room calmed as each of them imagined the scene."

erhardgo4.7.d:0 "Speer sat in his lavish office. The last rays of the sun were coming through the tall windows, and the many lights of Welthauptstadt Germania beginning to flicker on. There was a decanter of brandy on the luxuriously lacquered desk, which the Führer was willingly partaking in. \n\nErhard had announced his resignation earlier that day. Even if Speer wanted to stop him going he couldn't have - and why would he? He had defied every order he had given him. Still, the man had been good at his job. Schmidt and Kiesinger had apparently retired for the day, and somehow Albert didn't think they would be far behind. He couldn't have Erhard killed, not now, and without them? He'd always been an outlier in the party. Hitler had sheltered him while he'd built his little sphere, but without him he relied on men like Tresckow to keep the army happy, or Erhard to fix this bloated mess that was his Reich. \n\nNow he was all alone.

erhardgo4.7.a:0 "Why do all the good people leave?"

erhardgo4.8.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Minimum Wage"
erhardgo4.8.d:0 "Speer scratched his chin and looked sideways again at the proposal laid out on his desk. "I don't understand, Herr Erhard," he said into the receiver. "I thought economics didn't like the idea of minimum wages. What are you advocating them for?"\n\nErhard's voice, even through the phone, was coarse, bold and full of pomp. "We aren't unified in that position, my Führer. Indeed, I think it's probably essential to furthering our economic recovery."\n\nThe Führer began tapping one finger on his desk, a nervous tic he'd acquired from many a heated debate with Erhard. "Well... Herr Erhard, I do respect your expertise, but if you're in the minority that makes your position on this tenuous. That's to say nothing of what the industrial leaders will think of it."\n\n"The industrialists?" Speer could hear the sarcasm coming. "Oh, I'm sure, my Führer. I'm sure the industrialists - the men who've grown rich from not having to pay their workers at all - have a far more well-considered perspective on this than your hand-picked economic minister."\n\n"Spare me, Erhard," Speer sighed. "Just explain your reasoning."\n\nThe old man wasted no time. "As long as we lack a minimum wage, we face a twofold problem. First, the people won't have any confidence in the jobs being offered to them. Why go looking for work when it will barely make a difference to your income in the first place? Second, right now our economy needs to be shifting goods and that can't happen if consumers lack purchasing power. Follow through with this plan and you'll see the difference in mere weeks."\n\nSpeer's finger stopped. The logic was sound... but what would the corporations think? Surely they knew a thing or two about economics - if they opposed this so stringently, could there be some merit to their arguments? "Thank you, Herr Erhard," he replied after a few moments. "I'll consider your proposal.""

erhardgo4.9.d:0 ""I told you this would happen!" Speer snapped, waving a fistful of indignant letters in Erhard's face. "See these? All from Reichswerke's major shareholders. That's not all, either! IG Farben has had their board members calling me all morning demanding to know what we're up to! They'd have been happier if I'd declared myself a communist!"\n\nErhard waited for the Führer to quiet down and lean back in his chair. "And what about the common man, my Führer? What does he think? What about the students, or your supporters in the Reichstag?"\n\nSpeer looked mortally offended for a brief moment before gritting his teeth and responding. "The Reich doesn't operate according to the wishes of the mob. I understand the dangers that kowtowing to the corporations poses, but-"\n\n"Oh, fuck the corporations!" bellowed Erhard, shooting upright with hands planted on the table, nearly biting his cigar in two. "Do you honestly think they have the Reich's interests at heart? They've grown fat on the profits that slavery offers - our economic situation is at least fifty percent their fault exclusively! If they hadn't been given carte blanche on German industry and put in a position to back your opposition, you wouldn't have faced such stiff resistance in the first place!\n\nFor the most powerful dictator on Earth, Speer suddenly felt very small. "Don't raise your voice to..."\n\nErhard's next words cut to the bone. "Our dear friend Benito once said that to make a people great, you have to send them into battle even if you need to kick them in the pants. The same's true even for a Führer! If you know what's best for Germany and its people, you'll heed MY advice and not that of some bloated, psychopathic slave-driver. Good day, Herr Speer.""

'Vienna Retailers Enjoy Biggest Boom Since 1938' read one headline. 'IG Farben Reports Major Quarterly Loss' said another.\n\n"You should have more faith in Erhard, my Führer." Kiesinger's inoffensive voice cut through the fog of Speer's thoughts, prompting him to glance up. The Deputy Führer was relaxed and cheerful-looking, not to mention entirely too correct in his assessment to yell at. "The Party's economists are all too politicized or corrupt to stand up for what the Reich and its people need."\n\n"I suppose," Speer grumbled, going back to his reading. "He's not the one who's been dealing with the backlash from executives and shareholders, though."\n\nKiesinger leaned forward onto the desk, hands folded, to get Speer's attention again. "Isn't that a price worth paying? Isn't having a few angry men to put in line a lot better than having the entire working class starve because they continue to live off the state's loose change?"\n\nThe Führer felt a little less tense suddenly, but was careful not to show it. "Yes, well... yes, it is. I suspect we'll feel the political repercussions for some time yet, though." He downed the last survey and looked straight at Kiesinger.

"Have you got your morning paper yet?"\n\nKiesinger peeked through the curtains at his neatly-maintained front lawn. "No, I think it's too early for that yet. What's happened?"\n\n"Speer's fucking killed our minimum wage legislation! Half our representatives in the Reichstag staged a walkout and the working class are out for blood! The Orpo's already fucking shot five people this morning!"\n\nKiesinger paused and chewed his lip. If the Orpo had turned violent that quickly, it meant that the Führer had ordered it. If the Führer had been that quick on the draw, it could have been part of his plan. "Dear God," he muttered. "What about Erhard? What's he doing?"\n\nSchmidt half-chuckled, half-sighed. "What do you think? He's gone to the Reich Chancellery to give Speer a piece of his mind. No, he didn't want to wait for us."\n\nKiesinger felt a bead of sweat drip down his temple and his neck start to prickle. "I'll head down there myself right away."

"My Führer?" came the tinny voice from the phone. "Are you still there?" Without responding, Speer dropped the receiver back into place and slumped back. A few different streams of thought ran through his mind. Had he definitely said no? Did he actually approve the proposal and just forget about it? Maybe Erhard was working to undermine him. How could he? Or maybe... maybe he wasn't. Maybe this was a good thing. But Erhard had disobeyed him. But maybe he was wrong? Maybe it was a blessing in disguise?\n\nIt took a long, long time and more than a few missed calls before any particular line of thinking won out and compelled Speer to pick up the phone once more."

Why the fuck else did you bring me on board?" Erhard was facing down Speer, leaning on the desk with a lit cigar smoking on the carpet at his feet.

Would you have talked to Hitler like this?" Kiesinger had never seen Speer shouting before - not even when browbeating the Bormannites in the Reichstag.\n\n"It's because of Hitler that you need my help in the first place, you arrogant shithead! He threw our economy in the gutter and you helped him do it! Why can't you confine yourself to political games and architecture instead of meddling in things you can't even begin to comprehend?" Erhard's hands, gripping the sides of Speer's desk, were so white that Kiesinger thought his knuckles might burst from their flesh.\n\nSpeer still hadn't noticed Kiesinger - nor, it seemed, Schmidt and von Tresckow, who also stood just inside the doorway looking equal parts awkward and frustrated. "If you won't even heed common sense," bellowed Erhard, "Then I suppose there's no need for me in this administration!"\n\n"Resign without my permission and I'll have you shot!" Speer blurted.

He enjoyed his cup of coffee which he so wanted before, just as the rest of his cabinet enjoyed their victory in seeing this pass.\n\nSchmidt and Erhard both pulled out their cigarette and their cigar to quietly celebrate this victory for their partner in the Army, much to the light displeasure of the Führer. Tresckow and Speidel respectfully gave their thanks to the Führer for keeping his word. It ended in their favor, and it was only appropriate for them to give some credit to their leader, no matter how reluctant he was.\n\nOnly Schörner fumed, unwilling to stand being in the same room as those who opposed him and with a Führer who let him down. In a huff, he stormed out of the Chancellery, much to the subtle joy of those who wished to spite him.\n\nAnd when news came to the German people about the lowered draft, there was much reason for them to rejoice. Families and friends were happy to know that their sons would not have to give up a part of their lives to serve the Fatherland. Although the conservative elements of the country eventually gave their protests against this new policy, there was nothing to stop the tide of joy that swept over the people."

tresckowgo4.5.d:0 ""My Führer," von Tresckow stated, a little shocked but more insulted, "you can't simply change your mind. This is a delicate matter that concerns not only the security of the Fatherland but the state of our army. Keeping the draft as it is is going to-"\n\n"I listened to you, and I understand, but I will not have it today. I have changed my mind."\n\n"With respect, my Führer, I must protest against this."\n\n"No, von Tresckow. I've said what I said."\n\nSchörner would have smiled at this change if not from the timely intervention of Schmidt and the rest of the cabinet. Speidel too had rose up from his seat. Schörner had not noted them.\n\nThe Foreign Minister was the first to speak up. "So you're just going to shoot down what he has suggested? Just like that?" He shook his head at Speer, perplexing the man because of the way he said that.\n\nThe Führer told him, "Don't question it, Schmidt. Schörner had a point."\n\n"Indeed he has. But I don't agree. Tresckow had a better point. There's no point in wasting resources on maintaining a large army. Our country needs less force."\n\n"And our country needs more people to work with. For the sake of the economy!" Erhard joined in. Soon Kiesinger stood.\n\n"I stand with my colleagues. My Führer, you must reconsider."\n\nSpeidel nodded to this, keeping himself quiet as Tresckow spoke up once more, "My Führer, please, it must not be ignored. You must consider the benefits of lowering the draft. It will pay off much more than leaving it as it is now."\n\nSchörner bit at his lower lip and turned to Speer. The Führer looked at all of them in silent contemplation, under pressure as he realized everyone was pushing him to make a decision now. There was no way to stall them. It had to be done. Speer sighed and said..."

kiesingergo4.1.d:0 "Speer nodded approvingly as he downed the final page of the proposal. A nice fat dose of funding for education and healthcare, enough to make the Reich look like one of the most progressive nations on Earth, was sure to go over well with anyone who had half a brain. "Well, Herr Kiesinger," he said with an honest smile, "This is more like it. It's nice to have a proposal that won't anger at least half the Reichstag come to my desk."\n\nKiesinger chuckled warmly. "I'm sure, my Führer. Herr Erhard can be quite an overbearing man at times, can't he?"\n\n"Now," Speer began, steepling his fingers. "It will be quite expensive, won't it? Not that I'm opposed to it - just considering the whole picture."\n\n"Yes, my Führer, it will cost us a fair amount. I'm sure it won't be difficult to sell to the Reichstag, though. Many of the newer representatives are populists at heart, and once information about this becomes public they'll be under immense pressure to accept it."\n\nThe Führer took a moment to stew it over. The Reich's children certainly needed investment in their futures, and if the money was available to give citizens better quality healthcare, why not do it? With the military cuts and a rationalized taxation system, there really wasn't much of an argument against it. The money would just be sitting around gathering dust otherwise, waiting for some greedy bureaucrat to start picking away at it. "Very good, Parteikanzler," Speer finally said. A quick scratch of his pen, and the proposal bore the official signature of the Führer. "Deliver it with my commendation. You've truly outdone yourself, Herr Kiesinger.""

kiesingergo4.2.d:0 "Speer had no sooner snatched up his ringing phone than the voice of Reinhard Gehlen, RND chief, came blurting out of the speaker amid a burst of static. "My Führer, I must speak with you!" he barked. "This bill of Herr Kiesinger's is-"\n\nThe Führer sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling a headache coming on already. "What about it, Gehlen? Legislation isn't your business. What are you bothering me for?"\n\nGehlen sounded indignant - angry, even. "It is my business when our national security is at stake. We can't afford to have our academic base get out of hand. It's a spawning ground for Bolshevism, as I'm sure any seasoned intelligence officer could tell you. Need I remind you of the dissident groups that have already emerged from the student movement? Do you want a dozen more appearing every few months?"\n\n"Don't be so hyperbolic, Gehlen," Speer replied with a roll of his eyes. "You want to deny our youth the same education that our rivals enjoy because you're scared that it might make your job a little harder? You're going to need a better excuse than that to oppose this."\n\nThe line was silent for a moment as Gehlen composed himself. "My Führer," he said, voice smooth and inoffensive once more, "The less a man knows, the more pliable he remains. The world is a dangerous place - too dangerous for us to risk the growth of subversive academia. Bolshevism and its cohorts have always found a home amongst short-sighted young men and women. You must maintain control over our education system at all levels to secure the compliance of future generations. Think on it, my Führer."\n\n"

kiesingergo4.3.t:0 "Kiesinger's Demands - Healthcare and Education"
kiesingergo4.3.d:0 ""My Führer, think about this!" Kiesinger was closer to anger than Speer had ever seen him.\n\nStill, Speer remained impassive. "I have thought about it, Parteikanzler. Herr Gehlen made a well-reasoned case."\n\n"Well-reasoned? The man's just being paranoid! Do you think the American government worries about what their younger citizens think in private? Do you think they care? We can't stop people having subversive thoughts - if they're even having them in the first place!"\n\n"Herr Kiesinger," Speer said, taking on a conciliatory tone. "Healthcare will still receive the funding it requires. And, you know, Gehlen is right: the world is a dangerous place, and our enemies will take any opportunity to spread un-German ideas amongst the youth. Germany certainly has a history of student radicalism already, so would it really be wise to encourage that?"\n\nKiesinger looked equal parts frustrated and baffled. "Un-German ideas? My Führer, this administration is built on 'un-German' ideas, no matter what we might tell the Party. Please, don't let Gehlen dictate policy to you. His opposition to this reform is obviously based on the interests of the RND, not the Reich as a whole."\n\nSpeer twiddled his thumbs beneath the desk. It did seem pointlessly obstructionist, but Gehlen had been forthcoming so far. Would he really act against the Reich's best interests? Would he really do that - just go to the Führer's office and tell lies?"
kiesingergo4.3.a:0 "Kiesinger's right, of course."

kiesingergo4.4.d:0 ""My Führer?"\n\nSpeer glanced up from his paperwork, a little surprised. It was unusual for his secretary to say anything more than strictly necessary to him. "Yes, Friedman?"\n\nThe young man looked awkward for a moment, as though he'd forgotten how to speak. His mouth opened and closed like a fish a few times before the words came spilling out. "My Führer, I just wanted to say thank you."\n\n"Oh," Speer smiled and went back to revising his newest speech. "Really, you needn't. You were overdue for a pay rise anyway."\n\n"It's not that, my Führer." Speer looked up again, puzzled. "I mean, this new legislation of yours the Reichstag just passed - it means a lot to me and... uh, to a lot of people I know, and people like me who grew up after the war. My wife can take up her degree again, and my mother doesn't have to choose between medicine and three square meals a day. So, um... thank you, my Führer."\n\nThe two men, separated by generations and, unbeknownst to Friedman, their politics, were silent for a moment. Then, Speer smiled again - sincerely, this time. "I'm glad to hear it. Making a difference to people like you was precisely the intention." Picking up his pen, Speer resumed his work, but not without one final smile and nod of approval at Friedman as he headed back to his desk with a little less weight on his heart."
kiesingergo4.4.a:0 "It's nice to be appreciated."

kiesingergo4.5.t:0 "Kiesinger's Demands - Healthcare and Education"
kiesingergo4.5.d:0 "Speer looked weary as he shuffled through one report after another. Feedback from the Reichstag had not been positive - there was near-universal dissatisfaction with the removal of education from the funding package. He'd never expected to see the day when the reformers and Bormannites would agree on anything, but here it was.\n\n"Letter from Herr Gehlen, my Führer," said Friedman, his secretary, placing a pair of sealed envelopes on the desk. "And another from the Parteikanzler. That's all, my Führer."\n\nSpeer regarded Friedman with a suspicious eye as he headed out the door. The boy had been so empty-eyed and listless recently, even with his pay increase. Perhaps it was time to find someone more personable to greet visitors. For now, however, he had a pile of letters to get through.\n\nNone were positive, save Gehlen's. Naturally, the RND head was overjoyed to know that the youth wouldn't have a chance to get any funny ideas, nor to be educated above their stations without a substantial amount of family wealth behind them. Speer couldn't even bear to read Kiesinger's - criticism from his inner circle only fostered greater stress. Still, this wasn't a complete setback for reformism, so how could anyone truly fault him for his decision? Surely education would have another chance for reform further down the line, once national security was less of a concern."

 kiesingergo4.6.desc:0 "Kurt Georg Kiesinger managed to find Albert Speer at just the right mood, it seemed. Almost pliable, he was hoping. Nonetheless, he entered the Führer's office and met with the man eye-to-eye. Raising an eyebrow, Speer began speaking. "Herr Kiesinger?" He asked. "My Führer," Kiesinger began, "There's something that needs to be tended to. It is an issue we've left unsolved for far too long, and I believe that today is the day where we can decide on what to do with it." Speer tensed up, if only slightly. What was the man planning? "Go on, Herr Kiesinger. What is this issue that you want solved?"\n\nHe nodded politely. "It is the matter of our religious policy." Speer felt the fingers on his pen press just a bit harder. "Yes, what of it?" He asked. "My Führer, as it stands right now, the Reich maintains Hitler's anti-religious laws. But, over the past few decades, the demographics of what our people believe in has not shifted too drastically. A significant portion are still practicing Protestants and Catholics, and-", "Are you, Herr Kiesinger..." Speer started, "asking me to reverse this change? Do you not remember what our previous Führer's wishes were?" Kiesinger simply nodded again, which irritated Speer even more. "Of course I know, my Führer. But you also realize that you have promised us reform? We've been the backbone of your operations quite a while now, and nobody would find it satisfactory if..."\n\n"This again," Speer nearly hissed. "I'm being strong-armed into accepting your damn proposal. And if I refuse?" Kiesinger now shook his head. "I don't know exactly what would happen if you did, my Führer, but you have only to gain by following through with this policy. You will bring stability into the Reich, and those who have been oppressed will be happier to serve. Not only that, it will weaken the grip that the hardliners wish to hold against us." Speer glared at him for a while. He was making good points, that was true, but was he about to go back on his word? The consequences if he did so...\n\nAfter a while of unpleasant silence, Speer's gaze lowered back down to the papers in front of him. "Herr Kiesinger...""

He said, and the man looked at Kiesinger with a mixture of impatience and boredom, less so gratitude and accepting of the flattery. "Whatever troubles befall your office, I am certain I can solve."\n\nSpeer leaned forward on his desk and put his hands together. "Herr Kiesinger, be well aware that much of the NSDAP will not be happy about this. The much unnecessary pressure will be far from helpful during this time. I hope you can keep them at bay." Kiesinger nodded politely.\n\n"Will that be all you require of me, my Führer?" He asked, and Speer looked to be actually thinking about the prospect for a few seconds, before merely shaking his head and speaking.\n\n"No, Herr Kiesinger. You are dismissed." When the Deputy Führer left the room, it entered into a stale, unpleasant silence. There were many names off the top of his head that he could name who would not appreciate this move. He merely crossed his fingers there wouldn't be too many wanting to voice their opinions."
 kiesingergo4.7.a:0 "Not Deputy Führer for no reason..."

 kiesingergo4.8.t:0 "Not So Fast"
 kiesingergo4.8.desc:0 "The morning was tiring. Having agreed to Kiesinger's request, Speer had to deal with the endless paperwork that would haunt him for months. Had it been only that, then his only concern would be the frustration of having to give up yet another one of his ambitions. But in a twist of fate that only served to make him even further annoyed, he had received letter after letter of high-ranking officials in the government, demanding that this be reversed. Though one in specific stood out - a letter with a particularly prestigious seal.\n\n"My Führer, I have heard about a deeply concerning change of pace within the upper echelons of the Volkshalle. Is this true? Are we stepping away from the building blocks that our previous Führer, Adolf Hitler, set for us? I, along with my allies and friends within the circles of the Reich, find ourselves worried that the integrity of National Socialist values will be threatened. Did we not talk about the futility of religion? Its needless superstition, and an insatiable desire to twist the present back towards the past? Not only that, but it is directly linked to the Jew. I will not speak of the attempts to synthesize our ideology and Christianity together, for it is an abomination, but rather I will speak of what secularization will lead to.\n\nWe have, thankfully, annihilated Judaism from Europa, but unfortunately, the claws of Abraham still follow us. I know that you, my Führer, have no love for Christ and his Jewry. And so I ask you to please reconsider what has been done. If you truly let our Reich slip into tolerating the Protestant and the Christian, then we will once again allow ourselves to be tainted by a religious ideology contrary to National Socialism, contrary to the thousand year Reich that we are to build, and contrary to our supremacy as an Aryan people. It is my hope that, when you receive this letter, you will quickly realize what decision to make.\n\nThe future of Germany is in your hands, my Führer, and I trust that you will make the right choice. - Reichsstatthalter Arthur Greiser of Wartheland."\n\nBy the end of it, Speer was gritting his teeth, wondering what the hell to do."

 kiesingergo4.28.t:0 "An Unsullied Spirit To A Rotten Messiah"
 kiesingergo4.28.desc:0 "Speer had only realized, moments after those words left his mouth, that it was perhaps one of the worst sentences he could have spoken. What was Kiesinger's previously boisterous and proud attitude crashed and burned like a zeppelin, and Kiesinger merely receded into silence. The seconds that passed were one of the most uncomfortable ones Speer felt in his entire life, and, daring not to move his eyes off of the Prussian, spot Kiesinger out from the corner of his eye, backing away, then moving behind Tresckow.\n\nThe man didn't even ask for permission to leave. Speer would have felt slighted for that, but by the circumstances right now, he wouldn't have bothered raising such protests. When the doorknob clicked open the door, Tresckow didn't move a muscle. When it closed behind him, Speer could feel sweat forming on his brow."

 kiesingergo4.9.t:0 "A Time Like Any Other"
 kiesingergo4.9.desc:0 "It was only a day later, in the afternoon, when Speer heard those familiar footsteps outside his door. Putting his papers away, he knew that the man who was about to come in would force Speer to pay full attention to him, in no small part due to his nature. With a small cough and clearing of his throat, the Führer rested his face and put his hands together in waiting. With a sharp but careful swing of the door, Tresckow stepped in, closing it behind him as he gave a crisp salute. "Herr Speer!" He began, almost as if he was the Führer. "I have heard of the situation developing."\n\n"Really, Herr Tresckow?" Speer asked, raising an eyebrow at the Prussian. "As you know, Herr Speer," he began, body language loosening just slightly. "I am a man who sees clearly into the past, and all of the good that it has served us. Though I strive for what unified our nation - Prussian discipline, mettle, and spirit, there's another element limiting Germany from reaching its full potential!" Speer slid a hand up to the side of his face. "Go on, Herr Tresckow..." He weakly encouraged.\n\nHe nodded dutifully. "The essence of God has been restricted, Herr Speer." The military man sighed. "In my own homeland, I see Protestants thrown out of churches for only doing their duty. Elsewhere, Catholics are harassed and their sermons broken up by police." Tresckow stated, eyes narrowing just a little bit. He could recognize that look Speer was giving him. "You may not care much about it, but many of Germany's citizens do. The direction you're taking shall be antithetical to their beliefs. If you want to avoid decades of strife, then I suggest pressing through with allowing people to worship openly."\n\nSpeer glanced at him inquisitively. He offered no sympathy to religion, and would be happy to see it gone, but was it really worth backing down? The choice, then, was between upholding the future of a Germany free of religion, or guaranteeing stability by allowing them to practice their faith."
 kiesingergo4.9.a:0 "Alright, Herr Tresckow. I won't bother with this further. I hope I don't regret this."

It felt like he was pinning himself up as a target for the police - and, truth be told, the close encounters he had with them told him that the Protestant was lucky to not be in jail yet. Exiting into the streets, the nicely-painted black letters against white said "GERMANY WITHOUT FAITH - GERMANY WITHOUT ITS SOUL!". He could see, in the far distance, the ominous and foreboding Volkshalle staring down at him as he gathered with his friends.\n\nAn hour and a half later, Josef rallied at the front, next to another ally of his who waved a flag around that spoke of a similar message. She was bolder, older than him - a veteran of these things, and he could always learn something new from her. But when they turned the street corner and met upon a patrol of military police, both parties stood dead in their tracks. Here, in Welthauptstadt Germania, was a small protest of ten marching about and wanting their freedom to ring true, and nobody was quite sure of what to do.\n\nThat was, until one of the policemen started cracking up. Nudging a fellow officer of his, they took a few minutes to find a megaphone, and with a click, they spoke. "The police is here to remind you all that Führer Speer has begun secularizing the anti-religious policies that have been currently instated." The tension between the two groups loosened significantly after that. "However, that still doesn't mean you can walk around and disrupt citizens. Go home and wait, unless you want to be punished." The casual tone of his voice slightly unnerved Josed, and he swallowed. There wasn't even a 'that is all', instead only the cutting of static as the policemen moved on."

 kiesingergo4.11.desc:0 "Every day, Nils had to stare it out of the window in his room. Every day, Nils locked eyes with that building, closed down, all the light of its life having left it so long ago. Every year, Nils hoped that something would change. That he would no longer have to do service to the Lord within the confines of his own home, always in danger of being watched by those that would want to stamp his faith out in these dark times. It had been so long, in fact, that only Nils remained to be the only one in his family who didn't just pay lip service to something that guided him for a lifetime. Even when he was told by his mother to stop fretting so much about prayer, and worry more about what would happen if he was caught, he did not relent. And for just a day, it seemed like his faith had proved its mettle, and its dedication.\n\nOne day, Nils had woken up to something different. The church was no longer dreadfully empty of souls. Instead, the lights had been turned on, and he could see his fellow Germans moving about. He took a care to not rush himself in excitement, however, as modesty remained an important concern. Yet... eventually, when he walked into that simple building, and met that familiar face of the preacher greeting him with a warmth that he lacked somehow back home, Nils felt at peace with himself. He heard it from one of his brothers that the government decreed a slow reversing of policy that would discriminate against the religious, and that made him both happy and shocked. What made them do such a thing? Perhaps someone had a change of heart. Whatever it was, he only hoped that it would remain that way.\n\nUntil it didn't. The next day afterwards, Nils nigh jumped out of his bed to see what state the church was in, and a low, sinking feeling overcame his stomach with what he saw. As if yesterday never happened, he saw soldiers guarding the front of the building, with people being ferried out, one by one. Perhaps they didn't have a change of heart at all, and it was all a charade - making a mockery of something they had already begun ruining. He found anger at the thought, and that anger did not abate when the hours passed. His family could see it, and his mother warned him to not be consumed by fury, but he knew better. Hours later, when Nils heard chanting from outside his house, he knew what to do. With a cross in one hand and a sturdy piece of wood concealed on his person, he went out to see a wave of people filling the street of the church, facing off against a squadron of military police."

Taking a deep breath, the disciplined Prussian stood firm. "Herr Speer." He began, voice cold and direct. "Do you realize what you are saying?" The Führer stared at him almost blankly, but nodded. "Yes, Herr Tresckow, I have said what I had on my mind. And?" If looks could hurt, then Tresckow's would be a wunderwaffe. "And? Herr Speer... I don't wish to cause a ruckus in your office, but you are causing a grave error as of this moment. I understand that you do not care about religion," and he was tempted to add 'instead you follow your own damnable devil', but relented. "I, however, put value on it. A value so high that, if I am still around to see it tarnished and ruined," he began, some frustration now clearly rising above the surface, "Stomped out in front of me, then, Herr Speer, I believe that my presence will no longer be necessary here."\n\nSpeer nearly flinched at the comment. Did Tresckow just imply a resignation? He balled a hand up into a fist and put it on the desk. "I... am I hearing you right, Herr Tresckow?" Speer asked, sounding taken aback. "You wouldn't do this. Not over something like this." The moment after he said that, the Prussian made a noise that sounded close to a hiss. "Of course I would!" He spoke, raising his voice that mixed anger and irritation together. "I cannot bother with being subtle about it, Herr Speer. If you want to snuff the light of religion in this country, then I shall not be here to see it, rest assured!" Speer glared at him. He couldn't tell if Tresckow would truly follow up on it, but he felt strongly like he would. "This... ridiculous dialogue of yours, is something I refuse to tolerate!" It felt like Speer's heart skipped a beat. Now a slow trickle of panic began filling his mind as Tresckow got more and more openly angry. "Herr Speer, you can consider my participation in this charade over!"\n\nAs Tresckow began turning around, he only had moments to think. He had to say something, because saying nothing would only serve to humiliate him. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Speer caught the Prussian's attention by saying..."
 kiesingergo4.12.a:0 "Hold on, damn it! I haven't even said anything yet!"

"... Have you changed your mind?" The military man asked. Speer swallowed back doubt and reluctantly spoke. "Herr Tresckow, I... we can speak of this further. It doesn't have to end here." He could sense the other man's stance tightening, and then, after a few terse seconds, he looked down at the floor.\n\n"Herr Speer..." He began. "I'll hear you out." Yet he didn't bother to turn around. A part of Speer wanted to face him head-on, but another was glad that wasn't the case. "However, I believe I need... something." That didn't sound like good news. "Something?" Speer asked, and Tresckow nodded. "Yes. It is something I believe will resolve this situation amicably. In a way that, at least I will find satisfactory." No. It absolutely did not sound like good news - not at all. "Then," Speer began, sighing and rubbing his forehead. "Go and acquire this 'something' of yours. I don't-- we don't have all day."\n\nAgain, Tresckow nodded. Quick and professionally. "Certainly, Herr Speer. I bid you goodbye and will return to you in just a short while."

He was expecting Tresckow again, for sure, but what he saw not only surprised him, but shocked him.\n\nFirst came Tresckow. Then came another three - all faces he distinctly, immediately recognized. Helmut Schmidt, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Ludwig Erhardt. Three extra personalities he did not want to meet today. Though he wanted to sink back in his seat, he sat firmly, and eyed them all with a strong gaze. "So this is your something." He stated, giving the fiercest gaze to Tresckow, who looked back at him and betrayed no emotion. "Gentlemen?" Tresckow said, turning to the other three, and they all nodded.\n\n"I'll speak on behalf of all four of us," Kiesinger said, nodding towards Speer, who looked at him warily. "You're making a most unwise choice, my Führer. Herr Tresckow is firmly dedicated to Germany's long-valued Christian beliefs. To get rid of them now, well..." He shook his head. "I believe you're missing the point of this alliance.\n\nSpeer felt his pointer finger press hard on the wooden surface of his table. He was cornered. Like a caged animal, he was at his wits end. He could deal with Tresckow on his own, but this? "My Führer?" Kiesinger asked, snapping Speer out of his dazed state and forcing his focus back on the four. "We need a choice from you, and I will make you well aware that this mutual pact of ours does not only go one way." Speer could swear, out from the corner of his eye, that he could feel disciplined eyes trained on every fidget of his hands and muscle on his face - but something must be said. A decision had to come to fruition, else what masqueraded as a simple demand would unravel into something much worse. "

No ulterior motives, no long-term plans, no shadows in the dark - and now, his pride would be turned against him, being forced to sit in his office and sign legislation after legislation about legalizing church practices and private worship. Not only that, but he had to deal with the bloody NSDAP.\n\nOr, at least, he would have. The next time Speer met Kiesinger, the air between them wasn't the happiest, but he was told that the most stringent of responses would be avoided and minimized to his office. He had helped the Gang, and so the Gang would help him. Not only that, in but a few days he had already received letters from Christians coming from all parts of Germany, thanking him for beginning the process of reversing decades of discrimination. Some were less grateful than others, but Speer felt bitter all the same. He never planned to secularize, but outside forces forced his hand, and, to further humiliate him, made it so that he looked like the man behind the job."

 kiesingergo4.16.t:0 "Moment Of Prescience"
 kiesingergo4.16.desc:0 "When the words left his mouth, he froze. Regret immediately came to him, and as his eyes shifted towards where Tresckow would be, all he was met with was the slam of the door closing behind an incredibly irate Prussian. The rest stared at him, a mixture of frustrated and purely dumbfounded. Erhard looked disgusted. Schmidt seemed irritated, and Kiesinger was disappointed, merely sighing and shaking his head. "A grave mistake, my Führer. I truly hoped it wouldn't come to this."\n\n"What do you mean?" Speer asked through gritted teeth. "You're not telling me he's-", "Resigning?" Kiesinger finished, and his expression dropped further. The air in the room continued to still. "By tomorrow, I am afraid."\n\nAs Speer struggled to recompose himself, Erhard drew in his cigar and puffed out some smoke, giving Speer a nasty glare. "I'll think on what happens next. The rest of you two can stay here and do whatever, but I'm leaving." As he did, Schmidt spoke up soon afterwards. "Actually... I believe I will go too. This has given me food for thought, and, well..." He nodded towards Speer, who looked lost for words. "Goodbye, my Führer."\n\nIt was only Kiesinger left standing, and he could read Speer like a book. "No point in you staying here," Speer almost snarled. "Go. Leave. You must have business to attend to, I'm sure." He was losing strength and energy to speak with every passing word, but Kiesinger merely nodded. "Of course I do, my Führer. Goodbye.""
 kiesingergo4.16.a:0 "Speer didn't get anything done that day."

 kiesingergo4.17.t:0 "Have Some Courtesy"
 kiesingergo4.17.desc:0 "Speer dreaded going to his office that morning. So much so that it took him almost half an hour extra before he exited his house, and he barely paid attention to whatever his chauffeur wanted to talk about. He wanted - no, he needed something to prevent him from going to do his job. Just for that day. Just so that he could have time off. There was nothing, however. There was no terrorist threat. There was no assassination attempt. Instead, the Führer simply crossed the streets of Germania, safe and sound as many other citizens of the Reich.\n\nWhen he came to his door, his hand grasped at the doorknob for much longer than he needed to. When he pushed it down, it felt like he had to use all the strength in his body to do so. When he walked in, his eyes looked at everything. The windows, the outside. The decorating, the cabinets. The papers.\n\nThe letters. He could spot their signatures from even where he was standing. Tremors began to slowly wrack up his torso and spread to his limbs as he counted them. Not even a last goodbye. Like snakes, they shed their skins and left. When his hand touched upon the surface of one letter, - Tresckow's, of course it stood at the top - a pang of guilt passed by his heart. In this Reich, however, one could not feel guilt. One could only move forward. Speer considered reading the letters; something useful to extract, perhaps. Then he realized that nothing about it was important. Not anymore.\n\nAnd so they were thrown into the trash. Unopened, unread. Left to wilt into nothingness. Words written would remain words unsaid, but they burned into Speer's mind."

 kiesingergo4.18.t:0 "An Alliance In Tatters"
 kiesingergo4.18.desc:0 "Speer pretended he was alright. He pretended that he had eaten three meals today. He pretended that he drank enough water appropriate for a man of his age. He pretended Germany was fine. He pretended that there was no migraine crawling up the back of his skull, and how he hadn't stopped shaking for most of the day, and how his mind wasn't a flash of thought patterns that resembled nothing coherent.\n\nSpeer wanted to pretend he was alright. But nothing was. Not after the empire of his dreams crumbled before his eyes, and from the rubble he picked and pulled his hands into, all that remained was the torn-up flag of the Reich. The tilted swastika staring back at him. He would have welcomed it, but now all that was left was its corrupted form, hollow and distorted. Since the Gang left, Speer came to a cold, cruel realization - one he knew from the start, but refused to acknowledge. It faced him here, in his study room, locked inside his own home, his mind swimming in a pool of painful memories and even more painful truths.\n\nThere was only one thing left for him. Only one avenue of support. A force that would corrupt him, too. But it was better him than anyone else. Even with his vision broken, he had a glimmer of hope that he could steer the wheel and prevent it from turning all the way. No longer could he think of a bright Germany.\n\nOnly one shrouded in darkness, the grip of the NSDAP slowly crushing the flickering light of true National Socialism. Now, he would stray down the path of insanity that would border him on all sides. He could only hope that he was not consumed by it."
 kiesingergo4.18.a:0 "There is nothing to do but serve. And serve I shall."

 kiesingergo4.19.t:0 "Hope You Guessed My Name"
 kiesingergo4.19.desc:0 "He felt glued to his chair. In fact, Speer felt like he was trapped in his office. Is this what claustrophobia felt like? Except the walls were too wide, the windows too open. His ears perked up to the sounds of cars passing by the street outside, and the wind blowing through the air. His eyes failed - perhaps purposefully - to notice the stack of papers on his desk. He didn't give them a look. Recently, he had developed a hate of letters. If someone asked him why, he would simply shrug, and tell them that he didn't really know why.\n\nHe would have been content with sitting there, doing nothing, for hours on end, until he got the opportunity to go home and do more of nothing. But silence never lasted long. At some point during the day, some hours in the afternoon, the phone in his office rang. The noise was shrill and piercing for his ears, but it alerted him quickly, and in a haze of sudden anger and irritation he grabbed it roughly and put it up against his ear. "Who is this?" He demanded.\n\n"Hmm. You should recognize me by voice alone," the other voice on the line spoke, and Speer could feel his anger receding instantly. "I am Theodor Oberländer. Quite... the important figure in the NSDAP. I believe I can make my services of use to you."\n\nThere were no protests. Ever since the Gang left, the reformist clique in the NSDAP would begin their eventual collapse. Only the reactionaries were left. The visionaries who twisted National Socialism and dragged it through mud and blood, and Speer could only slow it down. "I've recently come to the knowledge that your cabinet has resigned. A true shame." Nothing betrayed Oberländer's voice. "Not to worry. The NSDAP has always been a strong force, and since I am at the helm of the ones who used to oppose you, well... stability will come easy. Rest assured, this will be a fruitful venture. Now... I needn't waste more of your time, though I will tell you one thing." Speer gripped the phone in his hand tightly, and a part of him wanted to smash it against his desk. "Regardless of how you were as Führer before...""
 kiesingergo4.19.a:0 ""You shall be an excellent Führer now.""

 kiesingergo4.20.t:0 "Resolving The Stand-Off"
 kiesingergo4.20.desc:0 ""That would be too risky of a development," Speer said, waving off Kiesinger. "I already have the hardliners breathing down my neck. If we were to propose this secularization, they may just take the opportunity to corner our influence." Kiesinger breathed irritation and exhaled calm. Of course Speer would try to downplay the idea. That should have come as no surprise, but he was expecting less resistance than a hard no. Still, it wasn't a catastrophe.\n\nKiesinger nodded politely. "Of course, my Führer. While I would drop the topic..." Speer had a feeling there wasn't an end to this yet. "There is more that remains unaddressed. In fact, I believe I may bring you something to settle your doubts once and for all." Speer raised an eyebrow. "Something?" He asked. "Do you mean, perhaps, to bring me answers?" Kiesinger once again nodded. "If you may, my Führer - I shall leave, and return soon with answers in tow."\n\nSpeer looked at him with suspicion, but held his tongue on the more unsavoury things he wanted to say. Instead, he let out a short sigh. "You are dismissed, Herr Kiesinger. And do not take too long. I've not all day." As Kiesinger thanked the man and left the room, Speer was left to his thoughts."
 kiesingergo4.20.a:0 "What is Kiesinger's game?"

 kiesingergo4.27.t:0 "The Curtain Opens"
 kiesingergo4.27.desc:0 "When Speer heard two pairs of footsteps outside his door, one was calm and normal. The other, he realized, moments before the door swung open, was von Tresckow.\n\nKiesinger merely gave Speer a friendly glance as Tresckow nigh stomped inside into his office. He gave a crisp, though annoyed salute, and spoke. "Herr Speer!" He said, demanding the fading attention of the Führer. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger?" He asked in return, and the Prussian straightened himself up. "I will make this brief, but the message shall surely resound with you. Herr Speer, do you remember one of the primary goals of our alliance?" Speer nodded. "I remember all of them. What are you referring to, exactly?" He asked, shifting somewhat uncomfortably in his seat.\n\nTresckow harrumphed. "Freedom!" He exclaimed. "The freedom of Germany's people. Is that not one of the main things we've been promised? I would say that it is one of the tenets crafted into the political web we've created for each other!" Speer felt his energy draining after each and every word Tresckow spoke. "And what is the most prized freedom of them all, than the freedom of worship?" His gaze affixed on Speer's eyes, and the Führer could not dare to look away from him.\n\n"My Führer." Kiesinger said. "I believe Herr Tresckow will remain unsullied by the reply of silence. I advise..." He looked at Tresckow, who seemed intent to keep staring at Speer. "... for you to answer him." Then he looked back at Speer, who seemed deep in thought, though not for reasons the Prussian would hope for. The room remained silent for a few seconds more, but after long enough, Speer broke the silence. He was to determine the mood shift with what he said, and there were two lines of thought he could pursue."
 kiesingergo4.27.a:0 "The NSDAP is dangerous."
 kiesingergo4.27.b:0 "We cannot tarnish National Socialism's values any further."

 kiesingergo4.21.t:0 "To Reveal Fright"
 kiesingergo4.21.desc:0 ""The..." Speer sighed. "The NSDAP is a dangerous force, Herr Tresckow." The Prussian felt like he wanted to roll his eyes. What a silly, generic response. But it prevented another outburst from the man. Speer noted Tresckow's pose slightly relaxing, and he felt the smallest weight come off his shoulders. Kiesinger, however, looked fully unconvinced, yet let the man speak.\n\n"There is a significant amount of them that still oppose us at every turn!" He noted. "If we did something as extreme as this, they would jump at the opportunity to decry us as radicals. They could raise hell in the Reichstag, and... impede us at every point they could! It's simply something I find difficult to convince the hardliners on." As the two listened on, Speer's spiel seemed to have the opposite effect on their opinion - especially Kiesinger, who merely shook his head and sighed."
 kiesingergo4.21.a:0 ""Let me make a counter-point...""

 kiesingergo4.22.t:0 "The Curtain Begins Closing"
 kiesingergo4.22.desc:0 ""Go on, Herr Kiesinger..." Speer trailed off, feeling frustrated that he couldn't give much of a good argument in his favor.\n\nKiesinger nodded. "You speak of the consequences, but that is exactly why you should go through with this decision, my Führer. To the people, you are their leader." He stated the obvious, but Speer had a feeling that wasn't just it. "To the party, however..." Speer's eyes tightened just enough for Kiesinger to notice. And ignore, as his smile widened the slightest bit. "Well, you are no dictator. You do not make every rule and judgement."\n\n"So you are to take the fall?" Speer asked, and Kiesinger shook his head once again. "No, no. Better than that. I am not Deputy Führer for no reason. I will manage whatever the more unsavory part of the NSDAP shall unleash on us. I merely ask that you let this reform pass. Whatever happens, it shall be under my jurisdiction to take care of."\n\nSpeer pressed his palms against each other harder than normal. Again, Tresckow and Kiesinger fell into silence as the Führer thought, and they thought it better to let him think. And think he did. After almost a full ten seconds, Speer exhaled deeply and spoke."
 kiesingergo4.22.a:0 "This will be your problem now. Not mine."
 kiesingergo4.22.b:0 "I'm afraid, Herr Kiesinger, that it is too much of a risk."

 kiesingergo4.23.t:0 "The Curtain Falls"
 kiesingergo4.23.desc:0 "Kiesinger stared at Speer like a Nazi would at a Bolshevik. Yet, at the same time, it was subdued. Fading so quickly that Speer only caught a glimpse of the anger Kiesinger felt before it either vanished or remained, hidden behind Kiesinger's veil. Tresckow, meanwhile, looked almost stunned. "I have said what I have said, Herr Kiesinger. Do not expect me to relent on this decision."\n\nKiesinger exchanged a glance at Tresckow, who seemed stuck in thought. Then he coughed uncomfortably, and looked towards Speer, fixing up the tie on his suit. "If that's the case, then I needn't be here any longer. Am I dismissed, my Führer?" Speer eyed the Prussian with a sense of worry and confusion. He barely overheard Kiesinger's words, but gave a half-nod. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger... you are dismissed."\n\nAs the Deputy Führer left the room, he gave his last parting words as the Prussian seemed to regain his clarity."
 kiesingergo4.23.a:0 "It seems like Herr Tresckow is not done. Good luck, my Führer."

 kiesingergo4.24.t:0 "To Reveal An Inkling Of Madness"
 kiesingergo4.24.desc:0 "He didn't feel sure about this. But maybe- maybe it would work. "Well..." Speer began, as the two stared at him with a modicum of surprise. "You've heard me. Have the two of you forgotten what our Germany was built on?" He continued, feeling the ember of spirit embed itself in his voice, just a notch above the desperation he felt moments before. "It was the ideology that had the world in its grasp for decades!"\n\nHe could feel the disappointment emanating from them. Maybe he just struck the wrong chord? "The only reason why we are declining now is because we're moving past our roots! What made us strong! Germany needs its previous faith no more!" At that, Tresckow visibly began getting upset. Kiesinger, meanwhile, fell into neutrality - not a hint of emotion betraying his face.\n\n"And..." Speer continued, taking a moment to process and discard his regret. "To go back to the time where we were great, we cannot capitulate to these new ideas that want to drag us into the past!" When he stopped, he could only hesitantly look at Tresckow, who was positively brewing. Speer wanted to say something, but the Prussian fired the first shot."
 kiesingergo4.24.a:0 ""Herr. Speer.""

 kiesingergo4.25.t:0 "Purity Of Sin"
 kiesingergo4.25.desc:0 "It was like a ghost spoke to Speer. He froze still, and in a way, so did Kiesinger.\n\n"I am not a stupid man, Herr Speer." Tresckow said, glaring at Führer with enough strength to make the man feel like he was facing down a member of the SS. "Perhaps you take me as silly. Naïve, even. But that would be far from the truth." His sigh approached a growl, and Speer felt his throat going dry. "The past, Herr Speer? Really, now? The past that has shaped our entire culture from birth to present?! I have tolerated this insofar as having the idea that you would listen to Herr Kiesinger, as he speaks with reason, but I am mistaken."\n\nSpeer's eyes flicked back and forth between the two, but he dared not interrupt the Prussian. "Do you think these men and women some... some bandits?" He asked. "Some bomb-throwing anarchists? If so, I am shocked Germany is not up in flames from these Christians." Kiesinger shook his head. "No. The truth is much simpler. These are people - my people! They wish to be left in peace. To pray to their sole creator, and follow the path the Lord has given them!"\n\n"So, Herr Speer?" He asked, tightening a fist and quietly gritting his teeth towards the Führer. "Will you go against the will of the majority? They only wish for peace. Nothing more. And I would advise listening to the people's will. After all..." Tresckow's eyes narrowed. "That has always been the job of the Führer."\n\nKiesinger remained deathly quiet. Speer, meanwhile, felt like he faced down the barrel of a gun. Whatever he said, he had to mean it. So eventually, Speer regained his composure, and mustered a reply. "
 kiesingergo4.25.a:0 "Perhaps your points are sound, Herr Kiesinger."
 kiesingergo4.25.b:0 "These values... they... they mean nothing to me!"

 kiesingergo4.26.t:0 "Of Weak Resolve"
 kiesingergo4.26.desc:0 "Immediately, Tresckow loosened his body language. Then, Kiesinger broke out into a sigh he didn't know he was holding. Speer, meanwhile, wasn't done yet. Clearly sounding unsatisfied, he spoke like a man being forced to speak under threat od torture. "I do not want to see a single paper pertaining to any important member in the NSDAP. Do you understand, Herr Kiesinger?" He pointedly asked, and the man regained his focus to meet his gaze at him.\n\n"Of course I do, my Führer. I will try my best to cow the hardliners. Otherwise..." He looked towards Tresckow. "It seems to me like you're satisfied." When the Prussian was addressed, he straightened his back and stiffened his body once again. "Why wouldn't I? Today is a great day for Germany's people!" He exclaimed, then sighed. "This means I must have business to attend to." He said, and Speer gave him the slightest look of suspicion that he merely ignored. "Herr Speer," he addressed, prompting the Führer to listen closely. "Are we dismissed?"\n\nFeeling content in the fact that this was at least finally resolved - though far from being in his favor - he nodded."
 kiesingergo4.26.a:0 "The rest of the day went by, as monotonous as any other."

 kiesingergo4.29.t:0 "Down To Ground Level"
 kiesingergo4.29.desc:0 ""... That is to say, points different from what you would want me to agree on." Speer continued, and Tresckow began seizing on hostility in his eyes before suddenly realizing what the man meant, giving the Führer a small scare as the Prussian calmed down. Kiesinger, meanwhile, rubbed his forehead and grit his teeth for a second or two before speaking. "What, ah... what were these points you agreed on, my Führer?"\n\nSpeer almost audibly grumbled when asked to clarify. "Primarily one. It's the fact that, yes, I did promise some form of liberalization to Germany." He well and truly hated that word, but couldn't dodge saying it. "I suppose that... secularizing the country can fall under one of those freedoms." At that, Tresckow seemed to undergo some sort of mood swing, now standing properly and his gaze significantly softening to something more reasonable.\n\n"Ha-ha! I'm glad you see light to reason, Herr Speer!" He said, only prompting the Führer to feel more defeated - he wouldn't bother countering that. Tresckow nodded towards Kiesinger. "This calls for a celebration, doesn't it?" Kiesinger gave a somewhat meek nod, which Tresckow merely chuckled at. "Alright, well, I may at least celebrate this victory in private." Turning towards Speer, he continued. "Now, are we to be dismissed?" He was merely received with a sigh and a hand wave, gesturing for the two of them to leave his office.\n\nWith a sharp nod from Tresckow and a courteous one from Kiesinger, they left Speer to his thoughts."

While these targets may not be your top threats, they are the ones we are currently able to handle without sparking suspicion. I trust that you will deem these candidates as acceptable losses to protect your position. Each of these targets, if not dealt with swiftly and decisively, could use their knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET ONE: Karl Brandt, administrator of the Aktion T4 euthanasia program. Has close knowledge of your involvement in the Aktion T4 program- could use against you. NOTE: Despite your close personal connection to Herr Brandt, he poses a great danger to the security of your regime, particularly your support among the reformists.\n\nTARGET TWO: Karl Hanke, Gauleiter of Lower Silesia. Recommended you to Herr Goebbels, initiating your rise in the party. Knows of many of your controversial acts- very dangerous. RND sources indicate ties to SS-Ordenstaat Burgund. NOTE: Once again, despite your close connections, Hanke possesses a great threat to your power and influence, and may use his knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET THREE: Hans Kammler, engineer. Noted for his work on the V-2 Rocket. Once a subordinate of yours. Knows of your previous usage of and position on slaves. No personal connections- could leverage knowledge against you.\n\nOnce again, each of these men holds a sword of Damocles over you and your Fuhrership, and may drop it at any time. The longer we wait to deal with these issues, the more likely it is that one leverages their knowledge against you. I highly recommend immediate action.\n\nYours, Präsident Reinhard Gehlen."

Finally, after a moment to collect himself, Speer began.\n\n "I'm heartbroken, absolutely heartbroken, to be here today, mourning the passing of one of my oldest friends. Karl Brandt was a good man. He was a man dedicated to science and medicine, and he was one of my closest friends back in the day. Though we may have drifted apart as time went on, the bond that was shared between us never died, and I could not possibly express my full grief at his untimely passing. That an automobile accident struck down such a gem of our Reich serves as a terrible reminder that all of us are merely human, and must treasure and cherish our days on Earth. . ."\n\nHowever, if Karl Brandt, currently resting peacefully in his coffin, could speak instead of Speer, his story would have been vastly different than the eulogy that the Führer gave. Perhaps he would have regaled the audience with how, while he was returning from work, a truck veered out in front of him, forcing him off the road at high speeds. He may have emphasized how, while he was dazed and stunned by the crash, multiple RND men surrounded his vehicle. He certainly would have screamed about how the man in front of the wreck, noticing how Brandt still moved, drew his pistol and put one bullet directly through Brandt's skull. Brandt would have closed his tale on the fire, set by those same men that killed him, that engulfed the car and destroyed the evidence that they had ever been involved.\n\nBut Karl Brandt was dead, and so the crowd gave a standing ovation to their Führer as he concluded, not even suspecting the truth behind the untimely death of Karl Brandt."

The stalwart veteran of the NSDAP had been holidaying at a hunting lodge near Kattowitz with Silesian troops on leave, but failed to return from his evening walk last night. When the soldiers went out to search for him the following morning, they found Hanke lying unresponsive against a tree, with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. One of the Landsers, a medic, pronounced Hanke dead at the scene. A subsequent coroner's report found that Hanke had been dead for several hours before being discovered. More concerningly, it has been confirmed that Hanke was shot with a Polish submachine gun or pistol, casings from which were found nearby. Local Ordnungspolizei officers confirmed that a Polish terrorist cell had been active across the border with the General Government in recent years, and at least one member remained at large.\n\n"This is a terrible shock to me," said the Führer of Hanke's murder. "As many Party faithful know, it was Hanke's recommendation to the late Dr. Goebbels that began my career in the government. Not only do I owe him my position as Führer, but he was also a dear friend and confidant of many years. I hope with all my heart that our brave police officers and detectives can bring this case to a satisfying conclusion and enact justice for my friend and colleague."\n\nKarl Hanke had been a mildly controversial figure in recent years, owing to his long-standing support for the SS. He faced criticism at times from fellow NSDAP members for his political views, but was fully exonerated of alleged ties to treasonous elements by the Führer himself shortly after the Bürgerkrieg. Hanke is survived by his wife, Baroness Freda von Fircks, and their daughter."

speerpoland.1.t:0 "The OKW's Proposal"
speerpoland.1.d:0 "Henning von Tresckow was typically a very well dressed man, and today was no exception. His uniform, exquisitely ironed and cleaned, made even Speidel's uniform look messy and rumpled- and Speidel's uniform was holding up better than most. Together, they passed their report to the Fuhrer. If Tresckow's uniform looked tidy, and Speidel's looked alright, then Speer's suit looked like a mess of wrinkles and ink marks.\n\n"Herr Speidel, Herr Tresckow. May I have an explanation of your plan?" Speer spoke softly, his eyes crossing the lettering. Tresckow cleared his throat before beginning.\n\n "Germany holds numerous clear advantages over the new Polish state, but the most obvious one is our military advantage, Herr Speer. The Heer dwarfs anything the Poles could throw up. I propose that we use this fact to our advantage." Speidel nodded in agreement. Speer put the paper back down.\n\n"Invasion?" He asked bluntly. Tresckow's brow furrowed before he continued.\n\n"No, no- at least, not preferably. The threat of invasion should be more than sufficient to force the Poles to bend the knee. Besides that, multiple actions that benefit Poland will hopefully aid in creating a perception that we are no longer imperial maniacs, but rather a benevolent custodian."\n\nSpeer smiled. "I like it. You have my full permission to go ahead."\n\n"And, my Fuhrer, if they refuse- well, the threat of invasion is not an empty one." Speidel added, a faint smile crossing his lips. Speer nodded and watched as they exited."
speerpoland.1.a:0 "Let's see how it goes."

speerpoland.2.t:0 "The German Threat"
speerpoland.2.d:0 "Bad news has reached Warsaw today. The Germans are returning. A plan, outlined by Feldmarschall Speidel, details a scheme by the Germans to return to Polish lands. If it is not accepted, it's quite clear that Poland will not be spared an invasion. Germany will have hegemony, one way or the other."
speerpoland.2.a:0 "Accept"
speerpoland.2.b:0 "Decline"

speerpoland.3.t:0 "The Right Man"
speerpoland.3.d:0 "Two letters adorned Speer's desk today, and one made him significantly happier than the other.\n\nThe first was from the OKW itself. The issue of who to select for the occupation of Poland was a prickly one, and the two letters sitting on Speer's desk painted both sides nicely. On one hand was a letter from Tresckow, recommending an old army friend- Werner Schrader. The main part of Tresckow's pitch was Schrader's history in the Wehrmacht- a history of resistance to the greatest atrocities the Heer pulled off. Tresckow's argument rested upon this resistance- after all, would a standard Wehrmacht man be able to hold onto control in Poland without compromising the new face of the Reich?\n\nThe second letter was much more infuriating. Coming directly from Ferdinand Schorner- the root of all evil, Speer thought- this letter seemed directly out of the 40's. A screed against the Reich's new course, the Reich's decision on Poland, and the Polish nation in general, Schorner's letter called for an immediate reversal back into the genocidal policies of the Reich's earlier days. Incredible, Speer thought. To Schorner, everything was the nail, and he was always the hammer. It's as if he didn't realize that the war was over.\n\nThe choice was obvious. Speer sent a letter back to Tresckow, granting his approval of Schrader's portfolio. As a near afterthought, he swept Schorner's letter into the trash."

Then, they had fought their way through the fields of Europe, shredding the Polish Army, marching all the way to the hell that was the battle of Warsaw. Thousands of dead later, the city- and Poland- was theirs.\n\nTheir commander was hoping it would not need to happen again.\n\nThe men eyed the border guards on the Polish side as they raised the gate. Was there an ambush down the road? A division ready to kill any German they saw? As they drove through, tank commanders kept their hatches down and their guns up, ready for the attack they knew was coming.\n\nAnd yet, with every kilometer they drove with no interruption, their fear began to turn to disbelief. When they reached their first town, each and every tank commander silently sweat as the division of Armia Krajowa they were to disarm stood at attention. This is it, most thought. This was the moment where it all went to hell.\n\nWhen the Poles actually began to hand over their rifles, the disbelief was written all the 10th's faces as they handed out their medicine and food. The commander of the Poles was last in line- he took his food and medicine, looked into the German commander's stunned eyes, and smirked before walking away."

speerpoland.5.t:0 "An Early Repatriation"
speerpoland.5.d:0 "The crowd around Warsaw's train station swelled well out of the station, into the street, and down several blocks. Thousands of people lined the railroad, watching for the German trains carrying the most precious cargo they could. When the first line of smoke was sighted, far down the line, a shock of excitement swept through the crowd and the police line braced for impact.\n\nBy the time the train pulled into the station, a hushed tension had overtaken the crowd. Necks craned as German guards hopped from their carriages, securing a perimeter and a way out of the crowd. The tension in the air grew thick and heavy as the doors to the carrier cars opened.\n\nWhen the first slave, still in his prison uniform, stepped slowly into the sun, there was a moment of disbelief. Suddenly, the crowd exploded into cheers, chanting, yelling, and the police line buckled under the weight of thousands straining against them. As the slaves walked down the passage set out for them, flowers poured down onto their heads. Families strained to see loved ones.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the first truly joyous day for all of Poland since the revolution- their men were coming home. If the Germans were coming with them, so be it."

Speidel's offer has been accepted in full, and the stipulations of the peace are already beginning to be enforced.\n\nSpeer smiled when he read the message, already feeling the constant headache he had begin to clear. Thank god for Speidel. No treaty terms, no negotiations, no back and forth. Just a simple, clear statement and a simple, clear response. No Germans would die over Poland, and another victory for Speer would be delivered to his doorstep.\n\nAs he sat down, he made a mental reminder to invite Speidel over for a drink or two sometime. The man certainly deserved it."
speerpoland.6.a:0 "Splendid."

speerpoland.7.t:0 "The Polish Decline"
speerpoland.7.d:0 "Stunning news from Warsaw today- the Polish government has lost its mind. At least, that's the assumption of the Fuhrer's office, as instead of the diplomatic victory we expected, we've been delivered a bewildering refusal of our terms. To call this unexpected would be a massive understatement, as would it be a massive understatement to call this foolish. Poland stands no chance against the Reich's war machine- indeed, it seems this decision is made only in a desperate grasp to retain a sense of national pride. Whatever the motive, it seems that violence is inevitable.\n\nSpeer could feel his headache pulsate with every word of the refusal he read. Enraged, he tossed the letter into his trashcan. Were they serious? Did they think they would stand any chance against the Heer? Was this all merely an attempt to make Speer's life as hard as possible? In any case, it was clear- German boots would march over the Polish plains once again as invaders. The Fuhrer sighed as he sat down- this would be a mess in the Reichstag. He could only hope that Speidel was not as bad a commander as he was a negotiator."

speerpoland.8.t:0 "Speak Softly"

"I'd like you to explain it to me more, because frankly, I don't understand why we need to go to this much effort over a place like Poland."\n\nSchmidt straightened his tie. "It's less about Poland itself and more about the international effects, my Fuhrer."\n\nSpeer leaned back in his chair. "Elaborate."\n\n "Well, we could enforce our will through force of arms on the Poles, as we did in the 30's, but the main issue is that internationally, this would threaten our image as a reformist, gentler Reich."\n\n"The issue with your plan, Herr Schmidt, is that it's going to force us into promises we might not want to keep."\n\n"I understand my plan is not perfect, but it is the only way to keep our image safe. Besides, negotiation means no bloodshed, and neither of us want that, do we?" Schmidt smiled.\n\n "No, of course not. I give you permission to go ahead. Don't screw this up for me, will you?" Speer shuffled in his chair. Schmidt nodded before leaving the room, the hopes of the Reich's new standing resting squarely on his shoulders."
speerpoland.8.a:0 "We'll see how this goes."

speerpoland.9.t:0 "Offer for Diplomacy from Germany"
speerpoland.9.d:0 "Surprising news has come from Germania today- it seems that Helmut Schmidt, the Reich's foreign minister, wishes to negotiate a peace between the Reich and Poland.

speerpoland.9.a:0 "Agree"

speerpoland.10.t:0 "A Step Towards the Future"
speerpoland.10.d:0 "The news passed through the Foreign Ministry's hands quickly, fast tracked to two offices- Helmut Schmidt's and Albert Speer. The message read like a celebration- the Poles had, after much consideration and debate, accepted talks with Helmut Schmidt. Together, they wrote, they hoped that Poland and Germany would work together to take Europe into an ascendant future, these talks being the groundworks to lay such a foundation. Of course, it was all diplomatic flattery for now- nobody would dare to be brutally honest this early- but it was enough for Germany, and it was certainly enough for Schmidt and Speer.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert read the letter with a sigh of relief as he took a drink. Worries danced in his mind- what if they forced the Reich's hand? What if Schmidt promised the stars and the sun?- but he sidelined them for now. For now, things were moving along smoothly. Speer had to admit, despite his personal dislike of Schmidt, he got things done.\n\nIn Schmidt's office, Helmut took the news joyously. He had expected them to accept, but it actually happening gave him an opening. With the cooperation of the Poles, he could help set things right, once and for all, and Europe would be one step closer to the light."
speerpoland.10.a:0 "The hopes of Poland rest uneasy."

speerpoland.11.t:0 "Falling Back"
speerpoland.11.d:0 "The news shattered the morale of every hand it touched- a lightning strike to the reformists, a frustrating setback to the Speerites. It slowly slid its way through the Foreign Ministry, to be deposited with a thump on the desks of Speer and Schmidt. The news it communicated would be dismissed as comedy if it wasn't so real- the Poles, for whatever insane reason, had declined to negotiate, promising to defend Poland to the final man. Negotiations were dead before they even had the chance to begin.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert sat with a mixture of a sigh and an angered grunt. He'd listened to Schmidt for once, and look where it got them. The Poles thought they were weak, thought that Germany wouldn't be willing to take them on, all because Schmidt had decided to try and throw a rabid dog a carrot. Now, the Heer would need to get its hands dirty. He could already see the coffins, draped in the swastika, coming home from whatever muddy hellhole the Poles were in now. He could see the shitshow in the Reichstag from a mile away. Schmidt had gotten his way, and now look what had happened.\n\nIn Schmidt's office was, somehow, even more depressed than Speer's. Helmut slammed the letter into his trashcan with an angry grunt. He'd gambled, and somehow the Poles had screwed him over for it. What did they expect to happen? All they had done was make things worse for everyone. He sat down and awaited the angry call from a million different officials- the plan had collapsed, and here he was with a giant target on his back. He downed a drink before he took the first one."
speerpoland.11.a:0 "What do they think they're doing?"

speerpoland.12.t:0 "Germans in Poland"
speerpoland.12.d:0 "The tension between the two delegations lay thick and heavy in the conference room. Schmidt's eyes nervously darted across the faces of the Polish negotiators, settling finally on their head- one Stanislaw Wachowiak. Wachowiak's eyes bored right into Schmidt as the clock hit 12, and the meeting officially began.\n\nThe initial pleasantries soon faded away into a mess of diplomatic jargon, as veiled barbs and offers soon flew across the table. Unsurprisingly, it was not long before the first roadblock hit- the status of Germans in Poland.\n\n"The privileges that Germans in Poland held under the Generalgouvernement are unacceptable! We're practically chattel compared to them! Second class citizens in our own nation! We cannot, repeat, cannot go back to the old way of things- not now, not ever! They cannot continue to hold the privileges that they once did!" Wachowiak finished his fiery rant with a hearty slap of the table, to applause from his own delegation. The German delegation turned to Schmidt, his face deep in thought. A partial repeal of the Nuremberg Laws- something he'd wanted for years, but something that may fall well afoul of Speer's expectation. Besides, removing the rights of Germans for the wants of Poles- a group that much of Germany still considered "Untermensch''- was undoubtedly a shit show waiting to happen in itself. However, would the Poles accept a deal without this caveat? He sighed before responding, knowing these words would follow him forever."
speerpoland.12.a:0 "Keep up the Laws."
speerpoland.12.b:0 "The Poles deserve rights."

speerpoland.13.t:0 "Status of the Home Army"
speerpoland.13.d:0 ""Now, Mr. Wachowiak, onto the next topic- the Home Army." Schmidt read from his agenda slowly, taking a breath before continuing. "As previously agreed, the Home Army will disarm and disband, assuming these talks go through. This is correct, yes?"\n\n"Of course." Wachowiak straightened his tie as he spoke. Schmidt rolled his eyes as he reached the next point, bracing himself for the explosion.\n\n"Yes, of course. However, there have been calls from our more conservative counterparts to prosecute some of these men for, ah. . .'' Schmidt could see Wachowiak turning red in the face already, and he readied himself for the explosion. "Ah, treason and terrorism. Now, Mr. Wachowiak, these men did commit acts of violence against the German garrison-"\n\nWachowiak shot to his feet. "You're joking, Herr Schmidt! You can't be serious! You dare call fighting for freedom terrorism? Do you know how hard it's been to get the Home Army to even agree to disarm? They'll go ballistic! If you're going to arrest every freedom fighter in Poland, you may as well arrest this entire delegation, because I cannot think of a Polish man who did not fight the Germans! This is unacceptable, Herr Schmidt, simply unacceptable!" He roared, leaning over the table towards the German. Schmidt massaged his temples- a headache was coming on, and he doubted it would get any better until these talks finished."
speerpoland.13.a:0 "Disarmament shall suffice."
speerpoland.13.b:0 "Terrorism is terrorism."

speerpoland.14.t:0 "Status of Polish Slavery"
speerpoland.14.d:0 ""We both understand that the Fuhrer's policy on slavery is one of dismantlement, is that right?" Wachowiak spoke first this time, his voice having noticeably softened in the last hour or so. The attention of the table once again turned to him, including Schmidt's gaze.\n\n"Yes, that would be true." Schmidt responded, his eyes narrowing, a hint of Wachowiak's game beginning to form in his mind. Another bombshell, if Schmidt's intuition was true.\n\n"And these freed slaves are to be repatriated to their home nations, yes?" Wachowiak's gaze bored into Schmidt, who grew increasingly sure of where this conversation was being taken. He prepared a response in his head- this would be another headache to add to the pile.\n\n"Yes, that's the plan." Schmidt responded, steeling his voice.\n\n"Thousands of Poles still find themselves in German shackles today, Herr Schmidt, with years left before their freedom. Surely, as part of these talks, it's possible to speed their freedom, is it not?" Wachowiak's gaze never left Schmidt's eyes as he tried to think of a diplomatic response to this one.\n\n"Repatriation is a complicated business, especially when combined with-"\n\n"It's a yes-no question, Herr Schmidt." Schmidt slumped a little in his chair. This was never going to end, was it?"
speerpoland.14.a:0 "We need to stay realistic about Repatriation."
speerpoland.14.b:0 "Push for quicker Polish repatriation."

speerpoland.15.t:0 "Status of the Nuremberg Laws"
speerpoland.15.d:0 "The end of the conference was in sight, and Schmidt for one couldn't wait for it. He had known that his decisions would cause a storm of anger somewhere, no matter what he said, but he couldn't help but feel like this was going to be especially bad. His eyes, which had begun to glaze over with the endless conversation, snapped back to attention when they saw Wachowiak rise from his seat.\n\n"Now, I understand we have already touched on the topic of the Nuremberg laws-" Oh, christ, Schmidt thought. If there was something to fill his desk with angry letters, it was the Nuremberg laws."-But we have only spoken of the excessive privilege that Germans held in Poland. What we have not discussed is Polish rights- specifically, how limited they are."\n\nAs Wachowiak went through the list of limits on the Poles, Schmidt's thoughts turned inward. Once again, here was an opportunity to strike another blow at something that he had hated since the day he joined this job- the Nuremberg Laws, an outdated weight on the ankle of Germany, one that needed to be cut off. In any other case, he would not hesitate in cutting another slice into the Laws, but now? The Laws were the main legal guideline for Germany's treatment of the Poles. Such a massive change would definitely be something Speer would like to know about, and that was what was holding Schmidt back. He did not know Speer's position on the issue, and despite how much he disliked the man personally, Speer was the one who controlled his job. To go against him too much might just lead to his dismissal- something Schmidt couldn't allow to happen.\n\n"So, Herr Schmidt, I ask you-" Wachowiak finished with a flourish, leveling an accusatory finger at Schmidt's head. "-Is the Reich truly as reformist as it claims? Will you throw off the shackles that bind Poland?""
speerpoland.15.a:0 "Tone down on the Laws."
speerpoland.15.b:0 "This is too much to ask right now."

speerpoland.16.t:0 "Polish Budget"
speerpoland.16.d:0 ""Before this conference wraps up, Herr Schmidt, we have but one more topic to discuss." Wachowiak carefully pressed forth with the last topic on his paper, catching Schmidt as he was about to rise from his seat. Schmidt froze for a second, his face momentarily betraying the stress this conference had put on him, before he sat back down and gestured for Wachowiak to continue.\n\n"Besides the infrastructure built for Poland to become the Reich's logistical hub, Poland as a whole was neglected by the Reich. Our infrastructure in most places fails, our utilities are on the brink of failing, our roads are dotted with holes and cracks- we're on the brink of a disaster, Herr Schmidt. The Reich's coffers are certainly not empty- perhaps you can send some funds to our new government in order to allow us to rebuild? I promise you, such funds would be spent on infrastructure alone, nothing more."\n\nSchmidt took a deep breath in and out. Of course they were going for the wallet of the Reich now, as if they hadn't already aimed daggers at the rest of the Reich's institutions. Schmidt wasn't opposed to it himself- he just knew that it would maximise the amount of angry paperwork he'd need to sort through in the next month or two. Thoughts of a raging Speer clouded his mind- how many decisions had he already made for the Fuhrer? How many of them had been directly against his wishes?\n\nIn any case, it was the last decision to make, and then they would all shake hands and retire to their hotel rooms. Schmidt could only hope that his decisions would be acceptable to the Polish government- otherwise, this was going to be a mess for everyone involved."
speerpoland.16.a:0 "Grant them money."
speerpoland.16.b:0 "There's no point in it."

speerpoland.17.t:0 "The Treaty is Signed"
speerpoland.17.d:0 "Television crews crowded the conference room, reporters crammed themselves into every nook and cranny of the building, and the flash of cameras rattled like a machine gun. Schmidt did his best not to blink at the barrage- the last thing he needed on top of the inevitable storm he was going to catch was an unflattering image of him smeared across the front pages of every newspaper in Germany.\n\nTo his right, Wachowiak sat and smiled, looking quite pleased with himself. Schmidt couldn't blame him- he was going home a hero, having taken on the German giant and wrangled a deal that Poland could get behind out of it. Schmidt was less enthused himself- he would be going home to a storm of conservative anger and, most likely, at least one or two tense meetings with Speer. Speer hadn't said anything about the terms yet, but some of them would certainly be enough to make him tear what remained of his hair out.\n\nAnd yet, at the end of the day, Schmidt was proud of himself. He'd not only succeeded in his task, but he'd advanced his cause. Germany was on the cusp of entering a new golden age, and with Schmidt's help, he would make sure it would happen. With the treaty signed, who knew what could happen with the rest of Eastern Europe? Perhaps, soon enough, Germany could truly be first among equals in their eyes, not just a colonial overlord.\n\nAnd so, as Wachowiak put pen to paper and signed his name on the treaty, Schmidt's expression turned into a small grin as he put ink to his own."
speerpoland.17.a:0 "The new golden age is almost here."

speerpoland.18.t:0 "The Treaty Falls Apart"
speerpoland.18.d:0 "Schmidt's room was dark, illuminated only by a lamp at his desk casting a yellow glow across it. The darkness hid most of the two men's faces- Schmidt and Wachowiak. Schmidt glanced at the clock- 2 in the morning, always a good time for diplomatic meetings. "So, what's the deal, Wachowiak? We've been waiting for hours. Communication troubles?"\n\n "No, no." Wachowiak was quiet, keeping his voice low. "I've been in contact with Warsaw just fine."\n\n"So what's the issue, then? We can schedule another session-" A drop of fear struck the bottom of Schmidt's gut, a slowly rising tide of worry.\n\n"No, no, Schmidt. It's over. They've left the conference. We're to go home effective immediately. The treaty is unacceptable."\n\nSchmidt's gut shot into his throat, and he choked on his next words. This couldn't happen to him. He couldn't have failed like this. He had wrangled so many things in line, pushed so many things his way, all for nothing? Visions of his face plastered as a scapegoat and fool across every paper in Germany shot through his mind like a bullet. Oh, god, what would Speer say? He'd put all his trust behind Schmidt's idea of a peaceful reconciliation. Now that it had fallen apart, would he ever listen to Schmidt again? Would he ever even try to negotiate again? Schmidt's plans fell apart in front of him as he struggled for words, struggled for air.\n\n"Stanislaw, you can't do this to me!" he shouted, but Stanislaw was already gone, the door shutting behind him. Schmidt was left alone, with only his furious, incredulous, terrified thoughts to keep him company."
speerpoland.18.a:0 "A travesty!"

speerpoland.19.t:0 "Ending a Farce"
speerpoland.19.d:0 "The Generalgouvernement of Poland had looked like a shiny jewel to the Rest of the Reich. When revolts had erupted all over Poland, however, Hans Frank's administration was revealed for what it was: a giant castle of lies, built on foundations of bribery and falsification of public reports. Everyone had thought such an inefficient and corrupt regime would have been crushed by the rage of the Polish resistance that had been festering in Poland's purulent bureaucracy and society for decades, but instead, Frank managed to resist the onslaught, whether due to bribes, ruthless repression or simply a stroke of luck.\n\nNow, however, a new regime rules in Germania, one which can no longer tolerate such a shameful conduct. Frank will be brought in front of a court, and his administration will be disbanded in favor of one more capable of serving Germany's interests... and perhaps even Poland's, should this be in our plans. The problem is, the cur knows what awaits him once he is relieved of his office, and refuses to submit, denying our Führer's legitimate claim to the mantle of Hitler's heir.\n\nTo address this issue, Feldmarschall von Tresckow has planned a quick and decisive military action, aimed at securing Poland and bringing Frank to justice. Our troops will cross the border and disarm the security forces of the Generalgouvernement: little resistance is expected as they have little in the way of numbers and equipment, especially with the Polish resistance keeping most of them constantly overstretched. The time to end this farce has long since been due, and now is the perfect time to draw the curtain."
speerpoland.19.a:0 "Frank will pay for his crimes."

speerpoland.20.t:0 "Hans Frank Surrenders!"
speerpoland.20.d:0 "As expected, the Generalgouvernement couldn't face the military might of the Wehrmacht, crippled by the Bürgerkrieg as it may be. The garrison offered mostly a token resistance before surrendering unconditionally, and our troops quickly converged on Warsaw: there, Hans Frank was already preparing to flee the country, but his retreat towards the airport was cut by an elite commando, and he was forced to capitulate when faced with the prospect of summary execution. Within a few hours, the few loyalists still fighting either dropped their weapons or were defeated by the Heer's crushing superiority.\n\nThe Generalgouvernement has been disbanded, and replaced by a provisory military administration that will ensure a return to normalcy. Our inspectors have already scoured Frank's archives, both public and secret, finding more than enough evidence of his crimes - bribery, embezzlement, falsification of public documents, treason, the list is very long - to permanently seal his fate, but the final choice rests in Speer's hands: should he be executed for his treasonous conduct, or merely imprisoned for life? Both choices would satisfy the population, but each will appeal to one of the currents within the government."
speerpoland.20.a:0 "Frank will meet the hangman."
speerpoland.20.b:0 "Imprisonment will suffice."

 
 ## Bohemian Events ##
 speerbohemia.1.t:0 "Approaching the Bohemians"
 speerbohemia.1.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nThe Reich has long considered Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren to be one of the most successful Germanization projects. As you know, the purpose of the Protektorat is to pacify the local population, and, through the various means available to them, make it so that they are either phased out for ethnic Germans, or educated to the point that we can call them proper Aryans. It has mainly been the second, and it has been a great success at that. The Protektorat, then, has succeeded in its objective; I would consider it now to be a viable territory to be annexed directly into the glorious Reich. I am hopeful that you understand my reasoning for this, Herr Lutz, and that you will comply with my request, which I am certain would not come as a major difficulty for you. Your service has been valuable, and now the next step must be taken.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n - Führer Speer"
 speerbohemia.1.a:0 "Let us see how they will react."

 speerbohemia.2.t:0 "The Bohemian Demands"
 speerbohemia.2.d:0 "This letter is to be addressed to the current Führer Albert Speer.\n\n I greet you warmly, dear Führer, leader of the Reich, the thousand-year Empire, the eagle that soars above Europa. I would gladly accept entry into Germania, seeing as how my leadership of this Protektorat has led to it being established as almost entirely Germanized. There is, however, one issue that remains which both you and I must confront. There has been an issue going around-- a very strange one, at that. We both know of the SS, the cancer that manifests itself as Ordensstaat Burgund, but also as smaller tumors that spread across Europe. They have spread here, too, but fortunately the Czech Guard has, under the leadership of Rudolf Toussaint, beaten back this nest of degeneracy. For that, Rudolf has called for a special proposal to be made. For their efforts, he desires for the Czechs to immediately be recognized as honorary Aryans. My Führer, it is only with you would I have even bothered sending this proposal back to you, for you are an understanding leader. It is my hope that you can accept this compromise in order for the Protektorat to be now and forever be fully integrated into the Reich.\n\nHeil!\n\n - Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk"
 speerbohemia.2.a:0 "Nothing but a small barrier."
 speerbohemia.2.b:0 "The Reich does not bend to the conquered."

 speerbohemia.3.t:0 "An Ultimatum to the Bohemians"
 speerbohemia.3.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nI must bring you unfortunate news. The idea that the Czechs must be turned into honorary Aryans has not been received well in Germania. They may have spilt blood to protect their territory, yes, but they are subservient to the Reich first. They must learn its culture and its ways, they must learn the language, and they must learn that to become a German,  you must know what it is to be a German. Anything else would be a disapproving notion of the Germanization process. I'm certain you understand then, Herr Lutz, when I tell you that my asking of the Protektorat to become a part of the Reich is no longer a request. It is a demand. This is, unfortunately, how things must go. I will give you a period of 72 hours to respond. If you do not respond in this time, the consequences will be drastic.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n - Führer Speer"
 speerbohemia.3.a:0 "Pray that they accept."

 speerbohemia.4.t:0 "The Annexation of Bohemia"
 speerbohemia.4.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nAfter considering your proposal for quite some time, I have come to achieve a resolution. While it may be slightly unbefitting for the Czechs to become Aryans on the spot, doing so would solve a multitude of our problems. As is the case right now, I cannot stand to comment on the actions of the Schutzstaffel in the Protektorat, but I can assure you that no foreign element will commit any sort of subversion in the territory. With this out of the way, I can congratulate your service for the Reich, Herr Lutz, and you will be rewarded generously in helping Germania expand its dominion to rightfully include all proper Germans, and honorary Aryans, into its home. That is all I shall be writing in this letter. The rest will come naturally, as we can finally say that this chapter of Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren is closed.\n\n - Führer Speer"
 speerbohemia.4.a:0 "More lands to the Empire!"

 speerbohemia.5.t:0 "The Bohemians Refuse"
 speerbohemia.5.d:0 "Speer paid it little thought-- they would accept. Obviously they would. What other choice could they possibly have?! But as the minutes turned into hours turned into days, his anxiety grew and grew. There was a mild annoyance for him after the first twenty-four hours, which turned into a bothering feeling that plagued him for another twenty-four hours, and once the final day had begun, it manifested into Speer pacing in his office, waiting, just waiting, for someone to come through and hand him a note. That they would say, "My Führer, you've received a letter from Reichsprotektorat Lutz," and then bid him a crisp salute before hurrying off.\n\nBut that moment of reprieve never came. Instead, the bell had struck midnight, and Speer almost drew blood from biting in his fingertip as the last seconds of peace slipped past him. Now he had an issue to deal with. Not a big one militarily, but it would show itself to the rest of the world as a glaring hole in Mitteleuropa. If he couldn't peacefully annex one of the most integrated subjects of the Reich, what would that say for all the others? That question crossed his mind many times as he began to draw up a plan of action."

 speerbohemia.7.t:0 "The Bohemians Accept"
 speerbohemia.7.d:0 "This letter is to be addressed to the current Führer Albert Speer.\n\nThese past three days have been worrisome, my Führer. Ever since I have received your letter, there has been chaos in the government. Panic struck many of our people, but I can say for certain that I have kept a clear head in these times. Immense pressure has been put on me from Rudolf to continue negotiating these terms. Eventually, however, I forced his hand and he had to back down after a fierce argument we've recently had. I write this letter to you now regarding the concerns between the Reich and the Protektorat with a simple sentence.\n\nWe accept.\n\n - Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk"
 speerbohemia.7.a:0 "I only hope you receive this letter in time."

 speerbohemia.8.t:0 "The Madmen Over the Mountains"
 speerbohemia.8.d:0 "Speer sat around in his office, cross-legged, frustrated, looking at his desk at a stack of papers while rubbing two fingers against his forehead. He wasn't really unaware about the circumstances facing Bohemia. In fact, he was fully aware that the SS, puppets of Himmler's insanity, had planted themselves into the Protektorat and had gone so far as to openly begin clashing with the German loyalists there. He was not expecting them to win, no, even if they were expertly trained, they were outnumbered, outgunned, and they had the resistance of the local populace. But something unexpected happened.\n\nThey did win.\n\nAnd now Speer had to deal with the issue of SS Bohemia staring down the barrel of the Empire. With casualties and destruction certain to follow, the whole process was something he wasn't exactly enthusiastic about. All Speer could hope for was that the ensuing conflict would be quick and relatively bloodless.\n\nSeveral minutes later, an old man came into Speer's office, dressed in full military uniform, seemingly ready to head into combat. Speer had, obviously, recognized who this figure was. "Tresckow," he began, catching the man's attention as Speer leaned forward. "I'll make this quick. I'll be on my way to hold a speech in Vienna. While I'm gone, I'll have to ask you to organize the troops and send them to the border. You've already been briefed on the situation, so I assume you needn't ask twice about dealing with the SS."\n\nTresckow shook his head. "Regardless of the feelings I have for them, my Führer," he began, "Their resistance to entering the Reich will be met with a swift response. It's the only reasonable thing to do." The pride in his voice made Speer nod weakly, letting out a sigh as he waved his hand. "Yes, yes. I understand what you're trying to say. Now leave me be. I need to sort these papers out.""
 speerbohemia.8.a:0 "The will of the Reich cannot be ignored."

 speerbohemia.9.t:0 "Striking the Barracks"
 speerbohemia.9.d:0 "That morning began with a crack that ruptured through the barracks. A gunshot that signified the beginning of the shift; he wasted no time at all in getting ready. In a minute he had gotten his uniform prepared - in another he obtained and loaded both his rifle and his sidearm, and in another he was standing shoulder to shoulder with his brothers all dressed in black. All in perfect order, as it should be, as it must be. Now he would continue to service the cause, and a gratitude of the continuation of this fact filled his mind for a moment, only for it to be just as quickly perished-- no emotion must linger too long.\n\nThe sharp cut through the air of a voice brought the soldier front and center into reality as the situation made itself clear and clarified in a moment's time. The degenerate Reich found itself trigger-happy to declare war against them for the sole purpose of being loyal to Ordenstaadt Burgund rather than the all-encompassing Empire that threatened their sovereignty. They had not earned this right, he would think, they would not step a foot in this land without proving themselves to be the low scum that they claimed to be otherwise.\n\nAnd so as the orders were barked out in meticulous order, boots marched across the floor of the barracks to prepare themselves for the eventual march outwards. He felt killing intent in his hands as he entered an armory designated for machine-gunners, and as he laid eyes upon a buzzsaw that would cut through rotten Aryan blood like a scythe through a field."
 speerbohemia.9.a:0 "A cacophony of noise and explosions followed."

 speerbohemia.10.t:0 "To Prevent Terror"
 speerbohemia.10.d:0 "Vienna was empty that day. Or, at least, it was cleared out of citizens. Considering the enemy the Reich was about to take on, it wasn't sure just what exactly this SS force was capable of, even if everyone assumed that they would be quickly crushed. Either way, Speer had paved way to make a speech, just as he had said before to Tresckow, who seemed to have sortied the army efficiently to the borders. Now he had to rile up the troops to fight their own. Not too difficult, he hoped, considering that who they were fighting was, well...\n\n"Soldiers of the Reich!" He began, "There is a festering abomination just beyond these borders. I am unwilling to name the beast that wanders from land to land, spreading an ideology that only serves to corrupt and destroy the lands and men it touches!" A resounding agreement came from the soldiers. They knew of the Black State and its disgusting off-branch of "supremacy" that amounted to nothing but insanity. "That is why I implore you, as citizens of Germany, to see this threat in the Protektorat as an obstacle to unification and nothing more! The SS there will be quashed under our jackboot, and no mercy will be given to its adherents. Strike hard, quickly, and annihilate them!"\n\nSpeer could see it, clearly, that these men listening to him regarded the SS as more ideological foes of the Reich than a beast in the making. Whatever justification to butcher these vermin would be, it didn't matter to him, so long as the influence of Himmler was contained to his feudal playground and nothing more."
 speerbohemia.10.a:0 "The Protektorat shall join us soon enough."

 speerbohemia.11.t:0 "Marching on Prague"
 speerbohemia.11.d:0 "Noise - that's what it was. So much noise had polluted the city when the war began. From the SS moving in and doing what the SS does, ranging from executing those who refused to fully cooperate with them to immediately beginning preparations of turning the city into a death trap. They did not have much time on their hands, owing it to the fact that the forces of the Reich, gutless as they were, still fought on the cult of speed and combined arms. And so it was that when they finally arrived, trucks chugging into highways, planes dotting the sky, and boots stomping against gravel, did the SS spring their trap. Explosions rocked one street corner after another, filling entire sections of Prague with dust and smog, while gunfire rained down from above barred apartments and abandoned shops.\n\nThe fighting was grueling, to say the least. Every inch the Heer took, the agents of Himmler would make sure that it was paid dearly, either in blood spilled or buildings laying themselves bare and crippled after the SS exhausted their defensive capability. It was before the sun had fully set, nearing the edge of darkness, when Prague found a vague semblance of peace overtake the majority of the city. The destruction had not been severe enough to warrant a crisis, but a rebuilding program would need to be begun, and many heartfelt letters were sorely needed back in the homeland. Even still, the menace was driven out of the capital, which proved an effective end to the terror plaguing the Protektorate."
 speerbohemia.11.a:0 "Back to Burgundy, devils!"

 ## Danish Events ##
 speerdenmark.1.t:0 "Approaching the Danes"
 speerdenmark.1.d:0 "Speer had always found it a little annoying, if he was to be openly honest about it, that this small nation of not much significance stood tall above the Reich, retaining its full independence and colours on any map printed out. Not only could they be easily swayed to join the Pakt, but he could make a strong case on why they would only benefit such a thing, being close Aryan brothers and having no real land disagreements. The idea would be twofold. First, Speer would offer the Danish government a small helping hand upon entering the Pakt, so they could ease themselves in and be comfortable amid the rest of the Reich's allies. Secondly, he would hold a speech that would be televised to viewers home and abroad, where he would testify to the strength of the Reich and the solitary situation the Danish found themselves, which, if they accepted the help of their Aryan brothers below, is something that would be easily rectified. Now all that remained was to begin planning."
 speerdenmark.1.a:0 "They will return home."

 speerdenmark.2.t:0 "The Carrot and the Stick"
 speerdenmark.2.d:0 "There was nothing particularly outstanding about Denmark, he thought, once Speer had looked over the economic analysis of the country. Nothing at all that really made it especially valuable besides being another source for manpower and labor to feed into the Reich. That wasn't the concern here, however, even if Speer considered the Danes to be easy candidates for Germanization. They were to become allies first, and anything else would come afterwards.\n\nA short and direct economic plan was drafted up, which would give the Danes small, temporary privileges upon entering the Reich. This would take up a small portion of the Reich's budget, and perhaps annoy the other subjects of the Pakt slightly for favoring them like this, but continuing to consecrate rule across Europa would only benefit everyone involved."
 speerdenmark.2.a:0 "Now onto the next step."

 speerdenmark.3.t:0 "They're Nothing Without Us"
 speerdenmark.3.d:0 "Speer couldn't understand how some men could hold speeches that lasted for so long about such trivial things. This, chiefly, was one of those trivial things. He was already so close in convincing them to join that he was almost visibly annoyed with dragging it out with the Danes by the time he had to begin to address the people listening.\n\nThere was a short interlude whereupon a presenter introduced the many titles of the Führer, inciting roaring applause from the audience that was present, before the man nodded towards Speer as he let him take the stand.\n\n"To the people of Denmark, listen to what I have to say next. I wish to call upon you a simple fact - a statement that cannot be ignored, an issue that cannot be resolved, a bothersome idea that trails behind your every footstep." Speer took a deep breath\n\n"You are alone. In this reshaping of the New World Order, you are alone."\n\n"All of your troubles, your loneliness, your vulnerability, this will leave you only as prey for greater powers willing to ruin you, bring you down into the sinking depths of history. But we are your Germanic brothers. We are your neighbours, the ones from across the river that shall bid you a warm greeting. We, the men of the Reich, are here for you. Like a man fumbling in the raging river, drowning and calling for help, we will come to you and lend you a hand. And with a mighty Germanic grip, we will pull you out, to the safety of the world, and we will call you a friend of ours."\n\n"Come, Denmark, for the thousand-year Reich shall soar with the rest of Europa on its wings."
 speerdenmark.3.a:0 "I see how they hold speeches about trivial things, now."

 speerdenmark.4.t:0 "Welcome Home"
 speerdenmark.4.d:0 "Speer let out a sigh of relief. What else was he expecting to happen, really? Considering the geopolitical position of the Danes, there really was only one option left for them to take. The other would leave them stranded and alone, ripe for the taking. As he silently read the letter through in his office, a small, satisfied smile came to his lips. They had agreed, and over the course of the next month, Denmark would begin its entry into the Pakt. Seems like his Germanic rhetoric had worked after all, and the money boost certainly convinced the more pragmatic-minded Danes in their cabinet. The economy of the Reichspakt would see a small, but noticeable, increase in its wealth, and the maps of Europa printed out in the future could finally shade that small blotch of land in as belonging to the Reich's sphere of influence."
 speerdenmark.4.a:0 "With this taken care of, Speer turns to other issues."

 speerdenmark.5.t:0 "The Extremists to the North"
 speerdenmark.5.d:0 "Damnation! While this wasn't the worst case scenario, it certainly came close to it. With the Hardliners now having a stranglehold on Denmark, there would certainly be no way to introduce them into the Pakt, seeing Speer's position as Führer to be a betrayal of their original values. Whatever they were planning, they had to be stopped and quickly brought under the wing of the Reich. Which is why he had to call for a certain... someone.\n\n"My Führer- it is a pleasure that I have been called to your office," the man in front of Speer spoke, standing tall and straight with a smile on his face. He put a hand out, and they both shook strongly before letting go. "I have a feeling you already know what I am about to tell you, Herr Reinhardt," Speer spoke, turning around and taking a few steps forwards to his desk. "I suppose I do, my Führer. This concerns Denmark, doesn't it?" The spymaster spoke, which confirmed Speer's suspicions. He didn't need to respond as his compatriot continued. "I will not speak on the topic of the ideology that has overtaken their government, but I can assure you that this will be an unusual operation." Speer could tell that Reinhardt was hiding something. Distaste, maybe? It didn't matter to him - they were National Socialists that would not compromise, and thus a threat to be destroyed.\n\n"There are already agents in place. What would you like me to do with them?" The response was obvious, but he wanted Speer to announce it for him. "Set them up for a coup. Your men... this operation will be risky, and if they're caught, they will likely face trial for their crimes. Anything less than treason against the state followed by execution would be a miracle." Reinhardt sighed, but did nothing more. The Führer could tell that the spymaster was getting impatient, and so he turned to face the man with a dismissive hand wave. "You are free to go. This operation is effective immediately."
 speerdenmark.5.a:0 "There will be no compromise with the Danish."

 speerdenmark.6.t:0 "Men on the Inside"
 speerdenmark.6.d:0 "The radio on the man's desk crackled to life as he approached it, and, sitting down, placed the headphones on his head. The shot of static made him flinch slightly, but the voice that followed afterwards gave him a smile."\n\n"Frederick, my friend!" He greeted boisterously, prompting the radio operator to turn down the volume. "Hah - how have you been, serving the Reich yonder over the border? I've just been spending my time walking around Copenhagen, following patrols and armored vehicles and taking pictures of them. It's not hard work, no, but I assume you've called me for a change of plans, eh?" He said, ending it with a short laugh.\n\nFrederick sighed softly. Could he let the man speak? It's almost as if he wasn't needed here. "Yes, Johann, I know what you've been doing recently-- it's my job to keep track of the agents in Denmark. At least, some of them, and that includes you." The static crackled back in with another bout of laughter. "That's the fighting spirit," Wilhelm commented. "Look, I've been seeing someone muck about in a pastry shop I've been frequenting recently. They seem sort of kept to themselves, but I can spot a proper Aryan when I see one! So tell me, Frederick, is that who I'm--"\n\n"Yes, yes it is." The dull, almost defeated voice cut in. "It's good that you're serving the Reich, and not the Danish. Look, if Headquarters is hearing in on this, they will have my neck. We are supposed to be disciplined, so I will give you your orders. Are you listening carefully?"\n\nSilence followed for several seconds afterwards.\n\n"Right then. That man you mentioned... you are to meet him, yes. His name is Oscar Blecher. Greet him with the phrase 'I wish to buy you a Lager, my friend', and he will recognize you right away as a man of the Reich. From then onwards, you are to follow his instructions. Is this clear?"\n\nAgain, silence dominated the radio frequency for a few seconds before Wilhelm spoke up, voice having now sombered up. "Yes, Bordfunker Frederick. I can assume, then, that this is where the operation will begin?", "That is the case. If you succeed, we will be able to topple the SS without having to fire a single shot. If not, then-", "Then nothing!" Wilhelm cut in joyously. "Don't worry about what will or will not happen. I hold no ill will towards the National Socialists here - but they stand in the way of the Reich. In toppling this resistance, I will be doing a service to the Führer. You have other things to tend to, my friend, and I hope to see you again. Now... goodbye, Bordfunker Frederick."
 speerdenmark.6.a:0 "Goodbye, Herr Wilhelm."

 speerdenmark.7.t:0 "Subverting Their Will"
 speerdenmark.7.d:0 "Frederick's pistol fit snugly in his coat as he felt the groove of the barrel while walking through the streets of Copenhagen. He dressed in civilian clothing, naturally, though made sure to wear thick enough clothing to conceal the weapon he was carrying with him. As he looked upon a small band of armed soldiers walking across a narrow street, he stopped up for a moment, glancing at the rifles in their hands for a moment before swiftly turning his head away. He hoped, he thought, he well and truly hoped that he didn't stand out as an oddity in these empty streets as he took the opportunity to scan his surroundings once more. Seeing now that there were no soldiers in this small section of Copenhagen, he dashed into a nearby alleyway, footsteps pounding against concrete that softened into blades of grass and dirt.\n\n"Herr... Frederick?" A voice called out in the darkness. He could recognize who it was. Or, rather, who they were. "I'm glad you recognized me. Was it my hair?" The sarcasm in his voice was annoyingly audible as a gang of three showed themselves. All three of them seemed heavily armed though lightly armored, carrying molotovs, grenades, each with a set of pistols, and one of them having a submachine gun. "No, Herr Reinhardt," spoke the one with the largest weapon, a heavy Danish accent tinting his German. "Nobody would willingly go into this alleyway alone."\n\nHe rolled his eyes. "Of course they wouldn't! I was only making a joke! I..." Reinhardt rolled his eyes. "Well, all humor aside, I suppose you gentlemen are here to parley with me. I know we are not friends, certainly, but I am under the orders of my Führer to help your resistance activities. I believe you will find my expertise to be most... exciting, if I may say."\n\n"Yeah?" One of them chimed in. "And you have to offer us what exactly?" The German chuckled heartily. "I am not a man of firearms."
 speerdenmark.7.a:0 "But if you give me a grenade or two, I can show you a trick."

 speerdenmark.8.t:0 "The Coup Begins"
 speerdenmark.8.d:0 "He swore he could feel his entire body shaking from that one. Well - it didn't matter now, did it?\n\n"Herr Frederick, if I may be so curious as to ask," came the voice of a man that was nearly drowned out by gunfire, "did the bastard Aryans hire you because they saw your potential, or because you bombed the nearest barr-" In speaking of bombs, two pairs of eyes spotted something distinctly hand-grenade-shaped coming their way, with both men giving all their strength to jump the hell away from where it would land. Frederick managed to get himself behind an empty oil barrel, while his other friend, who he came to know as Albert, took cover behind a shot-up, deflated truck. The German could tell when the explosion came when he felt a lack of noise and a presence of ringing in his ears both occurring at the same time, which he took as an opportunity to dust himself off and grip the pistol in his hand properly, turning back around and meeting up with Albert once again.\n\n"All of this just for our country to be handed over to the bloody Aryan," the other man spit out, glaring fiercely. "Shedding the blood of my countrymen... I thought I would be doing this for democracy." Frederick grinned. "Look at it this way, my Danish friend- we coup your country, we install a vague semblance of democracy. You enter the Pakt, you prosper from it. It's so simple, I hardly doubt anyone would say no to it." Albert audibly grumbled at that last part, only being stopped from speaking by being forced to duck his head under a shower of gunfire.\n\nThe conversation stopped for a few seconds to let the noise calm down enough for someone to actually be audible. "I hate this," Albert growled. "Don't look at me like that!" Frederick responded with fake concern. "Come on...""
 speerdenmark.8.a:0 "At least we're getting rid of the Hardliners for you."

 speerdenmark.9.t:0 "The Coup Fails"
 speerdenmark.9.d:0 "Frederick finally found himself some peace and quiet. In this abandoned-out building, he could rest for just a little bit. As he entered a room, he noticed that there was an abandoned sniper sitting perched up on a window, obviously aiming outside. His eyes widened and also shined when he spotted the weapon, even letting out a small 'ooh' as he approached it. Examining it carefully, he could see what it was. And the results were outstanding - it was a vintage weapon! Even more than that, it was a modified vintage weapon. The Karabiner 98 kurz with a scope mounted on top. Frederick was no marksman, but if this plan went successfully, then he could perhaps take this and keep it for himself as a reward for his service when he returned home. Though, he hadn't heard from his allies outside in a while, he was certain that everything would go alright.\n\nThat was, until he heard the soft sound of footsteps behind him. Frederick froze in place; he recognized the distance immediately, and it was not one that he would risk turning around for. Instead, he opted to slowly raise his arms up in the air, closing his eyes for a short while and taking a deep breath. The voice that came afterwards he only understood in fragments, but he didn't have to translate it. "German," he said, "I am a German. I don't understand Danish," he continued, and there was nothing in response for a second or two afterwards, which made the anxiety in his stomach grow heavier. Then, he heard a sigh, and another pair of footsteps. "You are coming with me, Aryan." It was slow, broken up and paced awkwardly, but it would make do. "Trial for treason."\n\nFrederick bit his lower lip. What the hell was he to do now except hand himself over? There was something, at least - a question that burned in his mind that he wanted answered before the inevitable came. "What has happened to the others outside?" A quick, cruel laughter came to meet his question. "Idiotic Aryan. Is it not clear?""
 speerdenmark.9.a:0 "You have failed your mission. Now, come, with the rest of the scum."

 speerdenmark.10.t:0 "Formalizing The Ultimatum"
 speerdenmark.10.d:0 ""To the people of Denmark..."\n\nSpeer crossed one leg over the other and stared at the typewriter. How was he going to formulate this... ? "The situation has turned dire."  He was to emphasize the danger the Danes were putting themselves in. Something about how the mistake they have made was grave, but in a way that showed strength, not desperation. "The Reich is unafraid to show why it is the Master of Europa." That would certainly catch their attention. Furthermore, he had to showcase that there is no degeneracy plaguing Germania. After all, if he wanted them to join the Pakt as well, he wanted to get them on their good side. And so...\n\n"... Ever since our magnificent victory so long ago, we have established a Reich that would last for generations to come. This is unprecedented in history. The empires of old - the Achaemenids, the Romans, the Francians, the British, they all share one fatal flaw in common. They relied on the strength of their arms, not on the strength of their people. We, however, are unified in our cause. It is, therefore, imperative that your people understand their position."\n\nHere Speer took a gamble.\n\n"The Reich's strength is unparalleled, its discipline unrivalled, and we do not wish to bring the full might of the Wehrmacht upon your nation. It would only bring ruin. Instead, we demand that you do two things. First, you will release every man related to the attempted coup in Copenhagen. They will be guaranteed safety, whether German or Danish, from any acts of violence against them. Secondly, the nation of Denmark will enter the Reichspakt, and will be treated as any regular member. Your opportunity to join as a special member has passed. Now there is only one choice to be made.""
 speerdenmark.10.a:0 "For the Danish Volk, I hope you make the correct choice."

 speerdenmark.11.t:0 "Denmark Refuses"
 speerdenmark.11.d:0 "Frederick was restrained from head to toe - not only did he have cuffs on, he also had a see-through bag on his head. Really, he thought, this was absurd. Admittedly he had only seen one trial in-person, and that was for a theft of goods in his hometown. The court wasn't nearly as grand as this, and nor was the judge as loud as the one he heard beforehand. He could barely understand what he was hearing, either, but the sinking feeling he had would tell him everything he needed to know. Here and there, while uncomfortably shuffling in his seat, he could hear the judge yelling out words like 'treason', 'betrayal', 'court', and probably a couple of swears here and there. The lump in his throat grew bigger as time passed, and a few questions were wandering his mind. Mainly, how long this whole charade would take. He thankfully had no family to worry about when he would eventually be dug into a ditch, but still, the idea of execution did not sound nice to him.\n\nThe slam of a gavel rang in his ears after two entire hours passed, and Frederick let out a breath he didn't realize he was keeping in for so long. Being roughly picked up by two guards, he felt a tremor go down his back. Shit - this was really happening, wasn't it? He was about to be brought out to the back to be executed like a dog, by people whose ideology he could share common ground with. A National Socialist executing another National Socialist. Frederick could only muster a shaky grin to himself as he closed his eyes, sending out a prayer to whatever deity was watching that some freak accident would happen.\n\nHe grunted when his body hit the dirt, and grit his teeth when he gave a single attempt at trying to break free of his restraints. There was too much ringing in his mind to hear whatever the hell was going outside of the confines of the bag on his head, and his uneven breaths bothered him. What did he say before? That he was an agent of the Reich? That he would lay his life down on the line? Well, now he was, in the most literal sense possible. Frederick found that a bit ironic, actually. So ironic that his lips parted as teeth bared themselves.\n\nToo bad he never got the time to let out a chuckle."
 speerdenmark.11.a:0 "It seems that the Danish have denied the ultimatum."

 speerdenmark.12.t:0 "Denmark Accepts"
 speerdenmark.12.d:0 "Frederick felt groggy in this cell. Perhaps it was the significantly different change of pace that he was used to. Perhaps it was the fact that he was stripped of all his pride down to prisoner's clothing. And it might just be the fact that he was about to get sent to his death. Who knows? Frederick sure as hell didn't, stuck in here and unavailable to hear news to the rest of the world. By the time the next morning came, he felt hungry, thirsty, and sure as hell annoyed. He knew how this trial would conclude, so what was taking them so long?!\n\nThe answer came in the form of a knock on his cell that caught his attention. "Herr Frederick," the man in the uniform said, drawing each syllable out. "Yes, what is it? Am I finally getting the bullet? Or am I reaching the chamber first before that happens?" He sarcastically bit back, standing up to his feet and staring at what looked like to be his jailor. "No, Herr Frederick. You are getting released.", "What?", "You heard me correctly. You are being released. Do I have to repeat this to you again?"\n\n"No... you don't." He wasn't willing to admit it openly, but a massive weight was lifted from his shoulders when he heard that he wasn't about to go six feet under. "Why, however?" The jailor stared at him with a mixture of boredom and disgust. "Your Führer has, to put it bluntly, threatened to invade our nation if we did not release you all and join your Pakt." He could almost feel the sneering expression from here. "I hope you are happy. Now," he began, plugging a key into the entrance. "Get out." He finished, emphasizing it with a click as the door opened. With a massive grin that was quickly tempered by his want to not get beaten up by the guard, Frederick walked out feeling like a new man. Though, something crossed his mind when he took the first step beyond bars."
 speerdenmark.12.a:0 "Can I get to keep that Karabiner I found... ?"

 speerdenmark.13.t:0 "The Coup Succeeds"
 speerdenmark.13.d:0 "Being in full uniform while laying down in an apartment bed was uncomfortable, Frederick noted. It was especially uncomfortable when he made the unwise decision of dragging cigarette smoke out of his mouth, resulting in a quick coughing fit as he struggled to sit up straight. Even after participating in open rebellion, nearly getting a bullet lodged into his brain, and explosions rocking him so hard he's likely going to lose his hearing by the time he was in his sixties, the German almost succumbed on the spot to one stupid decision. "The things that happen in life," he coughed out, mumbling to himself while he stared down at the wooden floor below. "That wouldn't have gotten me any medal of honor. Now where the hell-"\n\nThe banging on the door riddled with bullet holes made him jump in fright, reaching for his pistol and only stopping when he heard his native tongue being spoken. "Herr Frederick?" The voice called out. "Your car has arrived. I would suggest leaving immediately, as it would be best if we don't risk some rogue agent shooting up your vehicle." That made him crack a smile as he got up. He still kept the pistol at his side, however, just to be on the safe side. "I hope the Danes are not terrified of me when I step out.", "No, they-- Come on, Herr Frederick, if you want to be applauded for your efforts, you'll have time for it during the trip back to Germania.", "Fine, fine."\n\nDriving through the streets of Copenhagen now, once the violence had settled, felt strange to him. Surrounding the center of the city, Frederick could see clearly the aftereffects of what happened. Bloodied and burnt bodies with emptied-out weapons would be a common sight, with some places being warzones that he himself had to pass through. "So then, once I come home I believe I can safely say that I will be duly rewarded for my efforts," Frederick proudly spoke, staring out the car window while he talked. "The Führer will be most pleased to hear this news, after all, and I could see myself earning a raise in pay. Hmm... the possibilities." He turned to the driver who kept his focus narrow on the road. "Hey, what do you think will happen when I come home? Maybe they'll let me keep a souvenir gun at home? Ooh, I love bolt-action rifles. The noise they make when they shoot is so satisfying, and the click of the bolt...""
 speerdenmark.13.a:0 "The road back was long and arduous. Except for Frederick."

 ## Holland Events
 speerholland.1.t:0 "Meeting with the Dutch"
 speerholland.1.desc:0 "There is much reason for Germany to rejoice, with the civil war over, and the heart of the Reich secured under the banner of its new leader, Albert Speer. For the reunification of the Volk, however, there remain many battles still to be won. The Germanic people of Europe are divided, scattered across the continent, a stark contrast to Hitler's grand alliance system, and a definite liability to the new regime in Germania. To the West, Germany's brothers in Holland have yet to rejoin the Pakt, leaving both the Vaterland and the Netherlands in a precarious position.\n\nFor the new Führer and Foreign Minister Schmidt, reentry of Holland has become a diplomatic priority, and negotiations with [HOL.GetLeader] and the rest of the Hague are being planned. Within Speer's cabinet, there is much uncertainty about the coming meeting, but on the outside, Germany's head of state is all smiles and waves for the people. He reaffirmed this confidence to the public before he and his plane departed from Germania, ensuring the Völkischer Beobachter a quote for their headline:\n\n"The Dutch know where their blood belongs.""
 speerholland.1.a:0 "Gute Reise, mein Führer!"

 speerholland.2.t:0 "Germanic Brotherhood"
 speerholland.2.desc:0 "Was he certain once? He was certain he wasn't now. Decades under the doctrine of any belief can push the faith of any man, especially the smart ones, and, if anything, Speer certainly considered himself clever.\n\nIt was precisely this intelligence which commanded Speer to appeal to the Dutch reactionaries through race in his negotiations. In a speech to a collection of statesmen in the political capital of the Netherlands, the Führer connected the philosophical genius of the Dutch Descartes and Voetius, with the German Leibniz and Goethe. He connected the diplomatic centrality of the Hague with Bismarck's focus on alliances and peace. Both nations, Speer went on, shared a common history of honourable monarchies and fair republics, feudal states and global empires. Truly, there was a unique and profound link, at the level of blood, that connected the Dutch and the Germans in a genetic brotherhood. At this conclusion, a raucous applause erupted from the gathered crowd in the Binnenhof.\n\nSpeer wasn't certain about the Jews, but he was certain that Europe did have an inferior subhuman infesting it. The proud Aryans of Speer's homeland clung onto every word of Germanic superiority that emerged from their Führer's mouth. A million conservative ears, from Amsterdam to Danzig, fixated on his voice in their radios and television sets. Like pigs, the true untermenschen of the Reich lapped up Speer's lies."
 speerholland.2.a:0 "We're Brothers in Race"

 speerholland.3.t:0 "Wooing the Dutch"
 speerholland.3.desc:0 "It was in his negotiations that Speer realised he had underestimated the Dutch. Dealing with a nation built on foundational traditions of economic, diplomatic and trading expertise was not, he discovered, a walk in the park. To woo the Dutch, Speer (after some amount of stern lecturing and heated argumentation originating from one Ludwig Erhard) elected to offer them economic subsidies. Instead of the immediate acceptance he had hoped for, the German Führer was met with the smiling faces of the Dutch ministry, reliably followed by Erhard sending Speer a responsive glare. They demanded more. Much more.\n\nSpeer was faced with a decision. He could cave and hand the Dutch their favoured subsidies, which would curry favour in the Hague and guarantee them joining the Pakt, but harm both Germany's treasury and the Führer's legitimacy. On the other hand, Speer could refuse, try to call the Hague's bluff, while maintaining his image and his resources, but reducing the potential sympathies of the Netherlands for the Pakt, and certainly alienating Germany from Holland's favour"
 speerholland.3.a:0 "Accept their demands, pay the full subsidies."

 speerholland.4.desc:0 "Stern gazes and tight handshakes in the Hague today, as the Führer and the Netherlands have finally come to a compromise surrounding the matter of subsidies. Formalities abound, with [HOL.GetLeader] and Speer engaging in all the manners of true Germanic statesmen. An image of the two is to cover the front page of the Völkischer Beobachter, the leaders smiling, their arms around each other. It will make for a good headline and an excellent symbol for the renewed unity of the nations.\n\nThese are just the necessary appearances, however; neither the Dutch nor the Germans are entirely pleased with the outcome. In any event, with an imperfect agreement reached, the negotiations are almost ready to conclude..."
 speerholland.4.a:0 "Politics is not an exact science."

 speerholland.5.t:0 "They Always Want More..."
 speerholland.5.desc:0 "Word from the Hague is that the Führer's scheme has failed. Outwitting the Dutch proved too much for Germania's new cabinet, and on top of this, Holland has demanded more than their initial subsidy request. With Erhard fuming, it looks like there is no choice for Speer but to concede defeat and agree with the new demands. The Netherlands are guaranteed to return into the fold once more, but at the loss of Germany's dignity, the treasury's wallet, and the Führer's eardrums, once Erhard is through with them."
 speerholland.5.a:0 "Gott verdammt!"

 speerholland.6.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
 speerholland.6.desc:0 "After a long, and not in the slightest easy process, Holland has reentered the Pakt. Ceremonies are being held in Germania, the Hague, Amsterdam, and elsewhere across the two nations. The papers are decorated with messages of Aryan brotherhood, while the streets are adorned with the twin banners of the Prinsenvlag and the Swastika, flailing together in the wind.\n\nHolland and the Reich are now themselves flailing together in the wind. In a hostile world still haunted by Hitler's ghost, one more ally for the new Reich is far from taken for granted by the Führer. This new development has not saved him from the punishment of returning home, however. Erhard has developed quite the list of criticisms for the Führer's handling of the subsidy situation, with the plane from the Hague to Germania providing just enough time to go through them. Unlike his economic counterpart, Schmidt has little say on the matter for now.\n\nSpeer is scarcely paying attention to either. As the plane lifts off Dutch soil, the Führer stares out over the cityscape as it fades into the countryside. The old man sighs. One more nation, he thinks."
 speerholland.6.a:0 "Heims in Reich."

 speerholland.7.t:0 "The Madmen to the West"
 speerholland.7.desc:0 "In the absence of Germania's oversight, the Dutch have fallen into a particularly vile mode of governmental insanity. The Schutzstaffel have seized control of Holland, and have begun emulating the program of their brethren in Burgundy. In place of the old Reichkomissariat, the Himmlerite system has spread to cover the whole of the Low Countries. Speer was no thrall to the Nazi doctrine of the German heartland, and had moments of sincere doubt about the party's racial ideology. There was no doubt, however, that whatever the faults of the Reich, the wholesale slaughter and enslavement of good Germanic men and women being committed by the new Dutch regime were crimes of a uniquely wicked breed. \n\nKiesinger and Speer talk quietly with each other just outside the Reichstag's main hall. They are facing away from the rest of the cabinet, pointing and muttering about a piece of paper the Führer is gripping. His speech. The two old men exchange a glance of reassurance, before Kiesinger gives his leader a pat on the back, and follows Speer out in front of the crowd. \n\nSpeer took pride in the Volkshalle. It was a magnificent building, and the Führer considered it as much a symbol of his own expertise as the purported Volk it symbolised. He gazed out at the hundreds of faces that comprised the reichstag, placing his speech on the podium before him.\n\n"In our time of crisis," he began, "it seems our enemies have taken advantage of Germany's distracted might. The madmen to the West spread their tendrils, and if this cancer is left unchecked, it will form a malignant growth, the type that would fell lesser nations. We are not, however, a lesser nation. The German people will not fall silent while our brothers and sisters are murdered in Holland. As I speak, our brave Wehrmacht is moving across the Dutch border, and we will not halt until the Reich's flag flies over Amsterdam."

 speerholland.8.t:0 "We've Got Work To Do"
 speerholland.8.desc:0 "Speer had promised a war and a war he had won. Like the Romans of old, Speer enjoys some form of a triumphal parade in Germania, as the citizens of his Reich celebrate victory over Holland. Speer was a reformist, perhaps, but that did not mean he could not appreciate the finer pleasures of a Führer.\n\nFor Speer, this celebration was momentary. The Reich now occupied foreign territory, but could not retain military oversight forever. The Dutch would have their nation back, reintegrated into the Pakt, and with a stronger bond to Germania than before. The Chancellery, the Volkshalle and the Hague are now moving in sync with unity of purpose. The long march to civilian rule in the Netherlands has begun."

 speerholland.9.t:0 "A Propaganda Campaign"
 speerholland.9.desc:0 "Speer tapped his pen against his closed mouth, alone in the Chancellery office. The Führer's brow is furrowed. Holland is back in the Reich, yes, and the various ministries and state apparatus of Germany are working day-in-day-out in the reconstitution of the Netherlands. The land of the Dutch has been seized, but Speer knows that their hearts and minds are yet to be won. The Spartan ideology clouds their thoughts, and after any stint of SS rule, the citizenry may feel that their loyalties lie more in Ost-Paris than Germania.\n\nSpeer picks up the phone, and dials for Kiesinger. The tone fades into the Deputy Führer's familiar silvery tones. Speer speaks. "Kurt, I need you to rally some support in the Volkshalle. I want a propaganda campaign in Holland, in support of our government of course. Yes, posters, radio broadcasts, television shows, just get whatever you can get from the good folks in the party. You can do that? Thank you Kurt. Take care."\n\nThe Führer puts the phone down, and gazes out onto the Chancellery lawn."
 speerholland.9.a:0 "Peace is hell."

 speerholland.10.t:0 "Finding the Perfect Leadership"
 speerholland.10.desc:0 "The reports coming in from the Hague look promising. Holland's citizenry are giving growing approval in surveys across the country, notably a growing enthusiasm for the conduct of the Unity Pakt and confidence in the Netherlands' place inside it. The Volkshalle, of course, can barely contain its enthusiasm at the news. It seems that the propaganda campaign was a glowing success.\n\nRumour round the informed circles of Germania is that Schmidt and Speer are to meet in the Chancellery this afternoon. With the prospects looking better, the foreign minister and the Führer will be discussing who to nominate for leadership of the newly reintegrated low countries."

 speerholland.11.desc:0 "Even amongst the rough humanity presented by the Nazi party, Speer can always find a way. It was not just him, to be fair. The perfect leadership for Holland would not have been found without the help of Kiesinger and Schmidt, sure. Speer knew, however, that his vision had paved the way, and now with good men loyal to the Reich moving toward the Hague, Germania was one step closer towards its former glory.\n\nIn Holland, civilian government is slowly but surely being returned. The propaganda campaign and the leadership team have proved themselves remarkably. Now, as the military administration is dismantled, all traces of the SS have been removed. An operation successful, if the Führer did say so himself."

 speerslovakia.1.d:0 "To the South of Germany, bordering our territories in Schlesien and Mähren, lie the Carpathian Mountains. This great wall of rock caged the newly unified Hungary in the 9th Century, and before that had been the barrier that even the great Romans could not reach before being halted in their Eastern expansion. It is a bulwark, and a blight on our influence in the Balkans, and beyond.\n\nThere is a solution here, albeit a simple one. Winning over Slovakia would bypass the Carpathians and give the Reich a wider border with Hungary. Additionally, the reintegration of Slovakia into the Pakt would regain Germany an old ally, increasing our legitimacy in the eyes of both the public, and abroad. Considering this, Speer has sent an ultimatum to Bratislava; rejoin the Pakt or face invasion."

 speerslovakia.2.d:0 "Slovakia has received an envoy from the German foreign ministry; they are demanding that we either rejoin their Unity-Pakt or accept invasion. A damning choice if ever there was one.\n\nOn the one hand, we have little choice, with the German Heer far outweighing our own standing army and our extensive border with them allowing a swift invasion on their part. On the other, we would essentially be forfeiting much of our international sovereignty, both economic and political, and our population might not see eye to eye with us on choosing Germania's path."

The new regime that has been put in place is already reporting record numbers of enemy combatants- either surrendering, engaging our forces, or being caught fleeing the country. Most importantly, however, is the question of what we do with the captured soldiers.\n\nThese men- soldiers who fought under the regime of Otto-Heinrich Drechsler- are predominantly lower-ranking officers, such as lieutenants and sergeants. However, these men have committed treason- a crime punishable with anything up to death. To try them as traitors would certainly drive our point home and shore up our positions, but would also deprive the Heer of experienced, loyal soldiers. Meanwhile, pardoning these men would weaken our case and benefit the reactionaries, but these men would certainly be useful within our ranks. The decision falls to Albert Speer."

 speer.901.t:0 "An Ally In The East?"
 speer.901.d:0 ""Meyer-Landrut won? Interesting." Speer rubbed his jaw in contemplation. \n\n"Indeed. While of course I'd hoped for this outcome I hadn't expected it. He's maintained that you were the best choice as Führer since his uprising began. No doubt he'll be eager to rejoin the Reich." \n\n"No doubt." \n\nSchmidt had expected more - wasn't Speer pleased? "With your permission I will send him an invitation to Germania. I'll handle the negotiations for Ostland's handover personally." \n\n"Yes... and no. I want to meet him myself, get the measure of the man." Another surprise."
 speer.901.a:0 "As you wish."

 speer.902.t:0 "The Eastern Question"
 speer.902.d:0 "By god, but Landrut could talk. Since his arrival in Germania he had been gushing to Speer about this reform and that, barely giving him a chance to get a word in edgeways. Albert preferred it that way however. It gave him a better chance to determine what sort of man he truly was - an idealist who believed in democracy, or a pragmatist choosing his words to obtain popular support. A dangerous element to be removed, or a man he could work with. His fingers toyed at the button beneath his desk as Landrut went on and on. A single push, and the guards outside would have Landrut in a cell within seconds. His advisors would be furious to find out he had arrested a reformist ally, but he could certainly do with some credit from the more conservative elements of the party. Landrut seemed to have noticed his contemplation, for he stopped his waffling for a moment. "Mein Führer? Is something wrong?""
 speer.902.a:0 "This idiot really believes what he says. Press the button."
 speer.902.b:0 "He can be trusted to act in his own self interest."

 speer.903.t:0 "A Disappointing Meeting"
 speer.903.d:0 ""Mein Führer? Is something wrong?" Speer was broken from his reverie when Landrut ceased his speech. Andreas had been expecting... well, he hadn't been quite sure, but he had expected some response to his plans. Surely the man would be champing at the bit to incorporate his ideas, some of the only truly reformist ideas in the Reich - apart from his own, of course. Instead, he had just listened. \n\n"My apologies Andreas, I simply have a lot on my mind. It is good to find a true ally in these trying times. I am grateful for your work in Ostland, and now that it has been restored to the Reich we can get to work with our plans."\n\nWith that the Führer clearly considered the meeting over, as he rose and extended his hand. Meyer-Landrut clasped it in a firm grip, and shook it with enthusiasm. \n\n"Of course - the Führer's work is never done. Heil Speer!" He extended his arm in salute. When there was no response, he opened the door, chastened. \n\nOutside the door were half a dozen hulking OrPo officers, each one with their eyes locked on Andreas. He gulped. Surely, he didn't warrant such measures? He did his best to ignore the fact that they had their hands on their holstered pistols, and made his way out."
 speer.903.a:0 "Why does it feel like I have cheated death?"

 speer.904.t:0 "Idealism is a Fool's Game"
 speer.904.d:0 ""Herr Meyer-Landrut, you are under arrest for treason against the acting Reichskommissar of Ostland." \n\nMeyer-Landrut's mouth hung agape as the doors behind Speer opened with a crash, and half a dozen OrPo agents stormed into the room. As he tried to rise, his head was instead slammed against the table and handcuffs forced onto his wrists. \n\n"Mein Führer, I don't understand? I thought you were -" Whatever he was about to say was cut off as a bag was forced over his head. As he was frogmarched from the room, Speer didn't spare him a glance, instead contemplating the glass in his hand. Another traitor dealt with."
 speer.904.a:0 "Install someone smarter in his place."

 speerostland.6.t:0 "Dinner in Riga"
 speerostland.6.d:0 "Schmidt was already seated when Stahlecker entered the restaurant. The foreign minister stood, extending a hand. "Herr Stahlecker. A pleasure." The Reichskommissar grimaced and took Schmidt's hand before sitting. \n\n"Now, I assume you understand why we've called these negotiations. Germania is interested in returning Ostland into the Reich after our unfortunate separation. Are there any particular conditions your government is interested in?" \n\nStahlecker eyed the man opposite him carefully. "I would like to keep my position as Reichsminister in your new Ostland. And I would like immunity for my men. These are my requests." \n\n"One moment, Herr Stahlecker, I need to take a call." \n\nSpeer was on the other end of the line, and Schmidt relayed the information. The Führer and the foreign minister were faced with two choices. On the one hand, accepting Stahlecker's demands might ease the negotiation process and appease the existing regime there. On the other, a show of force and denial of Stahlecker's requests would appease the conservatives in the Party, and demonstrate Speer's courage and power as Führer. Speer pondered the options, and made his decision, hanging up the phone."
 speerostland.6.a:0 "Accept the demands. The less blood, the better."
 speerostland.6.b:0 "Push Stahlecker further. We're the Reich, not him."

 speerostland.7.t:0 "Investigating Insurgents"
 speerostland.7.d:0 ""Herr Stahlecker, the Führer is unable to fully grant one of your requests." The Reichskommissar eyed Schmidt sternly. "In good news, the majority of your said conditions can be guaranteed." \n\n"What is the catch, Herr Schmidt." \n\n"Your lower cabinet members will need to be investigated for security purposes. They may pose a considerable threat to the government in Germania, due to their links with the traitorous Bormann. I'm sure you understand that, in these trying times, the safety, wellbeing and stability of the Reich's people are of utmost importance to the Führer, and we can't be taking any major risks." Schmidt forced a smile. "For the good of the country, Herr Stahlecker." \n\nThe Ostlander stared at the table, grimacing. Schmidt observed him, wondering what thoughts lay behind those half glazed eyes."
 speerostland.7.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.8.t:0 "A Begrudging Acceptance"
 speerostland.8.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "I mean no disrespect, Herr Schmidt, but the past is the past. These are good men. Any grievances they may have had with your people can surely be overcome peacefully." \n\n"Herr Stahlecker, I appreciate your concern for your fellow Germans. Really, it is an honourable trait to have. As I said, however, the times cannot call for the sort of leniency that may have otherwise been desirable. In an ideal world, I would agree with you. Let bygones be bygones. The Führer, however, does not orchestrate an Elysium. We are building it, and we cannot allow workers who might pour sugar into our concrete. The new Germany needs stability." \n\nAnother long silence, before Stahlecker finally spoke."Okay. I will comply."\n\nSchmidt smiles warmly. "Thank you, Reichskommissar. One moment, please. I have to take this call.""
 speerostland.8.a:0 "Our negotiations push for more concessions, the man seems agreeable."
 speerostland.8.b:0 "Our negotiations accept Stahlecker's concessions, he has sacrificed much."

 speerostland.9.t:0 "No Reich for Old Men"
 speerostland.9.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "Do you remember what we saw out there, Herr Schmidt? During the war? You weren't there for long, were you?" \n\n"Herr Stahlecker-" \n\n"I won't be coddled or convinced with a 'Herr', Schmidt." Stahlecker leant forward and stood slightly, pressing his palms into the table as he stared directly into the foreign minister's eyes. \n\n"We saw a countryside littered with Jewry and Bolshevism. We saw a land once roamed by our German and Baltic forefathers corrupted with the burning greed and degeneracy of the Slavic swine. It was disgusting, Schmidt. It was horrifying. When we cleansed it, we liberated the land from it's filth. Yet we did not go far enough." \n\nStahlecker stood up from the table. "Ostland has been through a civil war, and my men won it. We fought the forces of Jewry and Bolshevism with a loyalty to the party, and to the ideas of Hitler and National Socialism. Bormann, Bormann represented those loyalties. You, and that fraudulent Führer of yours, would return Ostland to these devils. My men, they have committed crimes by the standard of your petty courts. They loved Bormann. Under your false laws, they are guilty, but under God, they are innocent." \n\nThe Reichskommissar, before Schmidt could respond, had walked out the door. In the heavens, the drums of war began to beat."
 speerostland.9.a:0 "Scheiße."

 speerostland.10.t:0 "A Second Demand"
 speerostland.10.d:0 "Schmidt put down the phone. His eyes had already communicated enough information to Stahlecker for a single glance to turn the Reichskommissar into a daze of despair. "Herr Stahlecker, the Führer has requested that the investigations might widen their scope." \n\nStahlecker sighed audibly. "I understand your reservations about this, but you must understand that the Reich cannot afford any chances at any level of government, especially the higher levels. Think of what one disloyal minister could do. Fraudulent documents, leaked information; sabotage at these levels could ruin the Reich." \n\nIn the Reichskommissar's head, thoughts were buzzing. His men were being threatened. This regime, this new Germany, this new Führer, they didn't care about him or his people. But did he have a choice? If he didn't comply, then what? The Heer would simply storm the border, and his government would be wiped off the face of the planet. Besides, Schmidt hadn't mentioned anything about him being put on trial himself..."
 speerostland.10.a:0 "What is a warlord to do?"

 speerostland.11.t:0 "A Second Concession"
 speerostland.11.d:0 "Stahlecker looks at Schmidt, any semblance of light fading from his eyes as he did so. "I concede, Herr foreign minister. For the good of the country." \n\nSchmidt nodded with an expression of solemn sympathy for the terrified Reichskommissar. "Thank you, Herr Stahlecker. I understand how difficult this must be for you, but it is in all Germany's best interest. Excuse me for one moment, I need to take this call...""
 speerostland.11.a:0 "Give the man a break. A peaceful transition is now more than possible."
 speerostland.11.b:0 "Another push. The man himself must be trialled; who knows what hidden sympathies lie behind that quiet exterior..."

 speerostland.12.t:0 "A Bridge Too Far"
 speerostland.12.d:0 "Stahlecker glared at Schmidt. A palpable rage stretched across the man's face as he did so, breaking the facade of courtesy he had built up over the course of the negotiation. "You would have every German in Ostland hung for treason, Herr Schmidt. Your 'reformists' in Germania are no better than the savages of Burgundy." \n\nThe Reichskommissar stood, Schmidt staring in a frozen awe. "When Bormann fell, so did the last hope for the Reich. Your petty Führer doesn't deserve to even be called a German." \n\nWith a mild flourish of his coat, Stahlecker turned and left the room. Above the room and across Yggdrasil, the drums of war in Asgard began to beat. In the quiet of the negotiations chamber, Schmidt could hear them, just barely. A sign from the gods of more to come."
 speerostland.12.a:0 "Scheiße."

 speerostland.13.t:0 "A Final Demand"
 speerostland.13.d:0 "The phone hit the shelf, and Schmidt returned to the table. "A final issue to iron out, Herr Stahlecker." By the tone in his voice, almost forcefully gentle, Stahlecker understood what Schmidt was about to say. "The Führer requests that you undergo a trial, a fair one, just to ensure Germania understands your past. I personally trust that you would remain quiet loyal to the Reich, Herr Reichskommissar, but to secure the doubts in my government, I would recommend this path." \n\nStahlecker's depressed expression morphed into something of an abject terror. "I would keep in mind, Herr Stahlecker, that refusal to comply with these demands may end with more trouble for you and your government than compliance.""
 speerostland.13.a:0 "Let us hope he sees reason."
 
 speerostland.14.t:0 "A Final Concession"
 speerostland.14.d:0 "Stahlecker began a shaky nod. "I-I understand Herr Schmidt." The foreign minister extended his hand for a comforting handshake. "Thank you, Herr Stahlecker. You have served your country well." \n\nSchmidt understood the criminality of the man opposite him, but couldn't help but question himself. Was he the good guy anymore? Threatening these men with a purge or trial? Demanding concessions for a Reich he didn't believe in. For the good of the country, he told himself."
 speerostland.14.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.15.t:0 "Mortal Danger"
 speerostland.15.d:0 "Stahlecker stood abruptly, stumbling away from the table. "N-no, Herr Schmidt. I-I can't do that." \n\nThe foreign minister stood, reaching out to try and comfort the man. "Herr Stahlecker, please, we can negotiate this." \n\n"No Schmidt. Y-you're all crazy. You'll kill me! You-you'll kill all of us!" \n\nThe Reichskommissar ran out of the room. Schmidt slumped back into his chair. He knew what this meant."
 speerostland.15.a:0 "War is coming."

 speerostland.16.t:0 "The Stahlecker Situation"
 speerostland.16.d:0 ""Franz Walter Stahlecker. Bormannite, and presently, Reichskommissar of Ostland," began the Führer. "In any situation, a major obstacle in our diplomatic reconstruction of the Reich's power."\n\n"Agreed, my Führer," replied Helmut Schmidt. \n\n"We need to rid ourselves of this blight quickly. I invited you here to discuss our options. You'll be leading a diplomatic envoy to the East to deal with the situation there. Any ideas?" \n\nSchmidt shuffled in his seat. "Well, my Führer..." His voice trailed off. \n\n"I'm listening, Schmidt." \n\n"I think it would be best to negotiate with Stahlecker. It might win us favour with the conservatives and give a show of force by punishing the traitor. We could force him into a harsh agreement and reintegrate Ostland back into the Reich that way. An enemy gone, territory gained and our friends in the Party might look at us with kinder eyes." \n\nSpeer stared into middle distance, thinking, but slowly nodding in approval. Schmidt couldn't help a slight, genuine smile at the peaceful route being favoured. "Or," Speer began, "we might declare war immediately. Rally the support of the reformists in a direct action and put him down quickly and effectively." \n\nSchmidt's expression morphed into something more familiarly depressed as he slouched in his chair. He let out a short and inaudible sigh. "It's your choice, my Führer." \n\n"Indeed. It is.""
 speerostland.16.a:0 "Diplomacy! Send Schmidt and the envoy."
 speerostland.16.b:0 "War! Rally the Heer and man the border."

 speerostland.17.t:0 "An Ally In The East?"
 speerostland.17.d:0 ""Meyer-Landrut won? Interesting." Speer rubbed his jaw in contemplation. \n\n"Indeed. While of course I'd hoped for this outcome I hadn't expected it.

I want to meet him myself, get the measure of the man." Another surprise."
 speerostland.17.a:0 "As you wish."

 speerostland.18.t:0 "Drechsler In Ostland"
 speerostland.18.d:0 ""Otto-Heinrich Drechsler. Militarist, expansionist, traitor, and victor." Speer read the report slowly, carefully taking in every detail. He knew Drechsler from his experience before the Burgerkrieg. The man was a paranoid coward, constantly itching for a fight, being a general pain. It was a surprise he'd never been disposed of.\n\nAnd yet, even as he caused problems in the east. Speer realized something. Drechsler was the perfect heel. Not only was he a traitor, but he was a militarist. Somehow, in losing- apparently, there had been a reformist in the Ostland chaos at some point- Speer had won more than he ever could have expected. A perfect target, a perfect ball and chain to tie to the reactionaries. Even if it would benefit the Gang as much as it benefited him, Speer was more than willing to make that sacrifice. Soon, Ostland would be under German control again, and the face of the traitors- along with their military ranks- would be plastered across every newspaper in Germany."
 speerostland.18.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.19.t:0 "Vituska In Ostland"
 speerostland.19.d:0 ""So, who is this Michal Vituska?" Speer read the report with interest, looking between it and Schmidt slowly, his eyes glancing over the little information that the paper provided.\n\n"We aren't entirely sure, Albert." Schmidt said with a sigh. "His past is. . .well, murky would be an understatement. What we know about him is that he's been a loyal collaborator with a lot of luck- at least, up until the Burgerkrieg, where he broke away from the Reichskommissariat to form a Central European Council, as he calls it. He's the dominant power in Ostland today."\n\n"And you said he was willing to negotiate?" Albert's eyes pored over the papers. Vituska's history was interesting, to say the least. A number of strange events and coincidences had brought him to the position of power he had held before Ostland broke down- definitely something that raised his eyebrow. Perhaps the man was more clever than he seemed.\n\n"Yes, he's said he's willing to cooperate. Shall I send an invitation?" Schmidt said. Speer nodded, and the Foreign Secretary made his exit. The Fuhrer put down his paper- there were certainly worse possible outcomes."
 speerostland.19.a:0 "We'll see what he wants."

 speerostland.20.t:0 "Meeting The Man"
 speerostland.20.d:0 "Michel Vituska entered Speer's office with a hearty "Heil!" and a quick salute, taking his seat with haste. Speer cocked his head- whether the man was nervous or enthusiastic, he couldn't tell. He took a breath before beginning. "Herr Vituska, thank you for accepting these negotiations. I trust you know why we're here?"\n\n"Yes, of course." Vituska quickly said, fidgeting in his chair a little. Speer's eyebrow raised a little- for a skilled leader, Vituska definitely seemed a little worried. Maybe it was the stakes. He disregarded it.\n\n"Now, I understand you had a few requests in exchange for rejoining the Reich, yes?" Speer said calmly. Vituska fidgeted a little more in his seat before he began.\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer. I would request to retain my role as Reichskommisar of Ostland, in exchange for my continued collaboration. In addition to this, I would similarly ask for the restrictions that Germany currently holds over Ostland to be relaxed, if not removed. With these two caveats, I'd be more than happy to peacefully rejoin the Reich."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows furrowed, his face betraying confusion, anger, and bemusement all at the same time. "You've come all this way to ask me to give you almost unimpeded control over one of the Reich's most valuable territories?"\n\n"Well, I wouldn't put it like that." Vituska said. Speer scoffed. What a waste of time."
 speerostland.20.a:0 "Onto Plan B."

 speerostland.21.t:0 "Harder Than We Thought"
 speerostland.21.d:0 ""Herr Vituska, you must be joking. Even if I wanted to- and I don't- can you imagine the damage of giving a Slav control of a Reichskommissariat? I'd be laughed out of the Reichstag. It can't be done." Speer's tone had taken on an almost incredulous tilt. He half expected Vituska to laugh and explain that it was all a joke. He didn't.\n\n"Herr Speer, these are my conditions. If you do not accept them, these talks must adjourn."Vituska said. His earlier nervousness was gone, replaced with a steely look. As foolish as Speer considered the man, he had to admit that he had a lot of nerve. It would not save him.\n\n"Well, Herr Vituska, if these talks are adjourned, I have no choice but to mark you a traitor, which means. . ." Three guards entered the room, their weapons at the ready. Speer watched Vituska closely for his reaction. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion when the man smiled.\n\n"You didn't think he'd actually come to this meeting in person, did you?"\n\nSpeer froze for a moment, before reaching for the photograph of Vituska he had on his desk and holding it up to the man's face. At a glance, they seemed to match, but further inspection proved it- this was not the same person. He threw the photo down and sighed.\n\n"Son of a bitch.""
 speerostland.21.a:0 "Clever man."

 speerostland.22.t:0 "Kovner In Ostland"
 speerostland.22.d:0 "During the Bürgerkrieg, chaos consumed much of Europe. Perhaps the most chaotic of these battlegrounds was not found in Frankfurt, or Saxony, but rather in Ostland. Ostland, once designed as "The Model Colony", proved that moniker to be a falsehood, as it fell to pieces within days of the Reich's own failure. Six sides burst from the unsteady Reichskommissariat, each fighting over the future of the area.\n\nStunningly, the United Partisan Organization, led by noted terrorist and murderer Abba Kovner, has come out on top of Ostland. This is an unmitigated disaster for us- not only because of Kovner's well-known Anti-German sentiment, but because of the political implications this holds. Already, conservatives in the Reichstag have made hay with this issue, attempting to tie our reformist views to this outcome. While this is unquestionably false, it's caught on in some circles, and our influence is bound to take a hit. Best to make short work of this and move on as fast as we can."
 speerostland.22.a:0 "What a mess."

 speerostland.23.t:0 "The Ostland Intervention"
 speerostland.23.d:0 "Speer's face paled as he read through the report. He was alone- there was no need for Schmidt, nor for anyone else in the Gang. No, this was an open-and-shut decision. An invasion was the only option for such a madman as Abba Kovner.\n\nThe reports chilled his blood to even look at. Stories of German soldiers being executed, German civilians being shot regularly, soldiers hanging from trees and lampposts- it was enough to make anyone retch. Such depraved brutality could not and would not be tolerated by the Reich.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the fastest the Reich's bureaucracy had moved since the Second World War. Within hours, divisions pushed across the Ostland border, engaging partisan forces wherever they found them. Each of them had two goals, and two goals only- push through Ostland as fast as possible, and save as many settlers as they could."
 speerostland.23.a:0 "There's no time to waste."

 speerostland.24.t:0 "Jeckeln In Ostland"
 speerostland.24.d:0 "Few names provoke such strong reactions in Germany as the name Schutzstaffel. Most react with hate, some with fear, some others with disgust. No matter who you ask, however, you're almost guaranteed to hear a tale of their brutality. One of the most widely reviled organizations in German history, the hope was that, with their defeat in the Burgerkrieg, they would be permanently banished to Burgundy to rot.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case.\n\nElements of the Ostland SS, led by Friedrich Jeckeln, have managed to seize control over Ostland, and are ruling with a fist of iron. Their maniacal ideology must be put down with extreme prejudice, effective immediately. On the political front, this development has aided the reformist wing of the party immeasurably, seeing as they've made numerous successful comparisons between the conservative wing of the Party and the SS. In any case, the intervention must happen, and it must happen soon, or there may be no Ostland to return to."
 speerostland.24.a:0 "How does this keep happening?"

 speerostland.25.t:0 "Chaos In Ostland"
 speerostland.25.d:0 "Schmidt's shoes clacked against the wood floor as he made his way to Speer's office. As he stepped inside, he could tell Speer was expecting him- he had been watching the door already. With a quick salute, he began.\n\n"My Fuhrer, as you know, Ostland is still engulfed in conflict. Their factions are still locked in combat with each other- six of them at start. That number has since been reduced."\n\nSpeer nodded. "Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\nSchmidt sighed. "There was, my Fuhrer, but his faction has been crushed. Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the industrialist. He gave it his best shot, but. . . well, he didn't succeed."\n\nSpeer grunted. "And there's nobody else there we could work with?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well." Speer looked out his window. "That's a pain, isn't it? Get the troops ready. We'll intervene, restore order, and go from there."\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer." And in a moment, Schmidt was gone."
 speerostland.25.a:0 "Frustrating."

"Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer." Speer perked up at that, his eyes widening. "Andreas Meyer-Landrut, a major industrialist in the region, has led a faction of reformists through the struggle. He's held his own quite well. Currently, he is the only faction I believe we could truly negotiate with."\n\nSpeer smiled. "Perfect. Organize an intervention. We'll move in, secure the region, and then take over for the man. It'll run like clockwork."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer." Schmidt said, with a smile on his face. It seemed both men were quite pleased with this result."
 speerostland.26.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.27.t:0 "Thank You For Your Service"
 speerostland.27.d:0 "Landrut smiled as he walked towards Speer, the men fast approaching each other in the hallway. Speer, for his part, looked suitably jovial as the men shared a warm handshake. "My Fuhrer, what an honor to meet you!" Landrut said amicably, his smile not leaving his face. Speer returned it.\n\n"Yes, Herr Landrut, you've truly done the Reich a service. Without you, this whole operation would be much more of a pain than it currently is. I can't thank you enough."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer. It was no trouble, really. I trust that this new administration will continue our efforts?"\n\n"Well, Herr Landrut, I need you to sign this first. Make it official and all." The two men stopped by a table with a paper on hand. Landrut took a pen and, still smiling, signed it. Speer smiled.\n\n"We can't thank you enough for your cooperation, Herr Landrut. Rest assured that Ostland will reform just as much as anywhere else in the Reich.""

 ###Moscowien EVENTS###
 
 speer_moskowien.3.t:0 "God Help Me, I Was Only 19" #Start of German Soldier Event Chain
 speer_moskowien.3.d:0 "Matthäus Schornberger leaned his chair back on two legs and lit his cigarette. The smoke wafted lazily into the air before being suddenly sucked out of the room, dragged by the wind that blew through the opened window. He puffed thoughtlessly as he stared out the window, taking in his street on the west end of Fulda. His father would kill him if he found out he was smoking, which is why he had to do it up in his room on the third floor of their house, one level above the kitchen and two levels above his father's workshop, filled with the tools of a watchmaker. Of course, his father was much more than just a watchmaker- he was a hero, an Iron Cross recipient, first class. Though his father never flaunted it, he knew the neighbors knew it. You could see it in their enthusiastic greetings, their preference of his business over others, the favors and gifts they gave him. His father was a man that all, including Matthias, respected; a man who had stood up to the Judeo-Bolsheviks out east and obliterated them. He was a man to look up to.\n\nWhat did Matthäus have to look forward to in his life, anyhow? He had turned the question over and over in his mind for months now, and he still had no answer. Sure, he studied, as his father wished, but what was the point? The slaves did all the work that Germany needed already. Did he really want to waste what should be the greatest years of his life on a degree he would have no purpose for, just for a society that had no need for it?"
 speer_moskowien.3.a:0 "What's the use of it?"
 
 speer_moskowien.77.t:0 "Making Up His Mind"
 speer_moskowien.77.d:0 "The army, on the other hand, was where Matthäus saw his legacy being made. There, he could serve a purpose to his fatherland. He could come home and have the same respect his father had. He could be someone, do something, and come home a stronger, wiser man, just as his father had. Besides, he still remembered the war stories his father had told him back when he was a boy. They spoke of joy and camaraderie, of glorious victories over the Jews and Slavs, of a great triumph and the stories that accompanied it. That sounded much better to Matthäus than sitting around in an office twiddling his thumbs for the rest of his life.\n\n The only thing that had been stopping him from rushing off to the recruitment office so far was, strangely enough, his father. Matthäus had floated the idea past him once and quickly learned not to make that mistake again. He'd never seen his father so angry. He'd made him promise he'd never go to the Heer, under any circumstances. Of course, Matthäus had promised- what else was he going to do?- but now he wondered why. He sat for a moment, the wind blowing through his room, deep in thought.\n\nSuddenly, he snuffed his cigarette out against the windowsill. He knew why his father was so angry about the mere thought of his son in the Heer- he didn't think he could do it. His father thinks he was too soft, did he? He thought he couldn't handle war, did he? He thought Matthäus couldn't handle responsibility or pressure, or having people depending on him. Matthäus knew it to be true- his father didn't seem to have much of a problem with telling his war stories, did he? Was he scared that his son could possibly upstage him, do more than even he could? Well, he was going to see it now. Matthäus was going to go into the army, and he was going to make his father wonder why he'd ever doubted him. He was going to make him sorry he'd ever even tried to stop him. He was going to be a soldier, and nothing was going to get in his way.\n\nFuriously, Matthäus scribbled out a farewell note and slapped it down on the kitchen table on his way to the door. While grabbing his coat, he turned around to savor the view of the house one more time. He was going to come back, and he was going to be more than his father could ever have dreamed of being.\n\nHe was going to be a hero."

 speer_moskowien.4.d:0 "The wind swept Matthäus's hair to the side as he stood in front of the recruiting office. The cold, concrete building almost seemed to stare right back at him, looking straight through him. In front of the building stood two Heer members, dressed in full parade attire. SIlently, he made his way past them and into the building.\n\n"Heil Speer!" The recruiting officer, sitting neatly at his desk, snapped to his salute, an action Matthäus returned. "What can I do for you, sir?"\n\n"I'm looking to join the Heer, sir." Matthäus replied, confidently. He made sure to keep his chest out and chin up.\n\n "Good, good. Just sign these papers and go into that room back there. You'll find a uniform, a helmet, and we'll direct you onto a bus out of here shortly."\n\nMatthäus sat down in front of the table, the pen clicking in his hands. Multiple papers were set in front of him, each detailing oaths and promises. "I will be loyal to the Fuhrer and to Germany." "I will not falter in my duty to the Reich." "I will uphold and support my fellow soldier, and follow orders without question." Yes, yes, and yes. He soon began to stop reading the papers, simply signing where they asked him to. Finally, he moved on to the back room, where his uniform awaited him.\n\nCrisp, folded, and clean, the grey uniform sat among rows of other uniforms identical to it. A small part of Matthäus's mind told him that this would be the cleanest he'd ever see it. He grabbed one that fit him, trying on the tunic and pants. The helmet, clean and polished, didn't fit all that well, but Matthäus couldn't find one that fit better, so he took it. When he was ready, he marched proudly out of the room and into the back, taking a seat besides other, similarly uniformed recruits.\n\nWithin minutes, a bus pulled up to the office, and the men were loaded on. As the bus pulled away, Matthäus took one last look around the city he had called home all his life. A new chapter of his story was just beginning."

Below him, a small queue was beginning to pile up, men watching his every swing as he desperately struggled for any traction. Though he couldn't see him, he could already tell the drill sergeant was getting closer to him.\n\n"There's Russian machine guns behind you, boy! They're getting closer, they're gonna kill your squadmates if you don't get past that fucking wall, boy!" Soft chuckles from the men below him. What made the situation even more humiliating was that none of the men before him had many problems with getting up and over. It was Matthäus, and Matthäus alone, who was struggling so much with it. He tried to pull himself up and over again, to no avail.\n\n"They're on top of us now, boy! They're shredding us, boy, there's guts all over your legs, boy, get over that wall!" Matthäus was about ready to just let go and quit. He wasn't made out for this, clearly. His father had been right.\n\nThe thought stopped him in his tracks. His father, if he returned home, would be insufferable. He would be right that Matthäus wasn't strong enough for this. Matthäus could picture his dad cracking open a beer in his shop, saying to some curious customer, "I told him over and over to not go, but he did, and you know what happened? I was right, and he's back at home now. I tell you, they aren't made like they used to be, are they?"\n\nWith a final heave, Matthäus pushed over the wall and fell to the ground on the other side. The drill sergeant gave him shit, for sure, but he didn't hear it. He was still going. He was still a soldier."

 speer_moskowien.7.d:0 "The truck shook and rattled as it rolled along the autobahn, staying behind the truck in front of it. Matthäus knew where they were going, and it shook him a little bit. The convoy was headed to Danzig- the furthest Matthäus had ever been from Fulda was Germania, and that had only been once or twice. Fulda, and the area around it, had been all he had known. Shaking a little, he pulled his assignment orders out of his pocket, reading them over for what seemed to be the hundredth time. Everything was in order- He was on a truck to Danzig to join the 16th Infantry Division. He assumed the men around him were on the same journey. The 16th Infantry- not a division that Matthäus had heard of in passing, but name recognition didn't matter much.\n\nThe man next to him tapped him on the shoulder. "Hey." he said cautiously. "You're from Bachrain?"\n\n"Oh, yeah, I've lived there my whole life."\n\n"Me too." The man said. "Schornberger. . .I feel like I've heard the name. The watchmaker, right?"\n\n"Not me. That's my dad."\n\n"Oh, really? He's good at what he does. A soldier too, I've heard. You following in his footsteps?"\n\n"Not exactly." Matthäus laughed. The two men's conversation continued, and soon other men began to join in. Matthäus learned they were all going to the 16th as well, as he expected. Most were from around Fulda, if not the city itself, though there were some from other areas. One even said he was from Vienna. Soon, the squad became fast friends. It's hard not to like someone when you spend 3 hours of a boring truck ride talking to them. As Matthäus spoke, he knew that he'd truly found his calling. If only his father could see him now!"

 speer_moskowien.6.t:0 "New Orders"
 speer_moskowien.6.d:0 "It was a normal day in Danzig, as the last six months had been. Matthäus lay in his bunk, daydreaming of going home. This wasn't the hero's life he had been promised. Indeed, the most action he had seen was an out of control truck crashing into the wall of the base a few months back. The rest of his time had been spent idly patrolling various parts of Danzig, from the docks to the barracks to the Governor's Palace. In general, it seemed like Matthäus would never become the same hero his father had been- not for lack of trying, but simply out of lack of opportunity.\n\nHis friend, a fellow named Johan, opened the door to the barrack and walked inside. "Guys, pack your shit. We're leaving in two hours, going out east." He yelled, to the complaint of those who were catching up to the sleep they had lost in the last few days. The barracks sleepily came alive, as man after man rolled out of their beds to put on their uniform. Matthäus did not move, instead thinking for a moment, before catching Johan's attention.\n\n "Johan, where are we going? What are we doing out east?"\n\n "We're being deployed. Apparently we're restoring order to the east, or some shit. I'm not clear on the details myself, but I know we're being deployed."\n\n Matthäus rushed from his bed, eager to get his pack ready. Finally, some action! He had been hoping for this day ever since he had joined the Heer. All the training, all the waiting, all the busywork- all had been leading up to these moments, where Matthäus could finally prove that, yes, he was able to do all the same work and more that his father did so many years ago. Within a few minutes, his personal items rested snugly in his pack. Matthäus, now dressed in his field greys, took one look at himself in the mirror on the wall before he marched outside to the trucks.\n\nHe looked quite nice. He looked natural. Above all else, he looked ready."

 speer_moskowien.8.d:0 "Matthäus's G1 rocked violently in his hands as he emptied the magazine down the street. All around him, his squadmates did their best to keep the fire going, ducking occasionally to avoid return fire. Matthäus ducked down again to reload, not even noticing the bullets that cracked the wall behind him. For now, his mind was solely focused on not dying, and serving his homeland. Even with his focus, and his attempts to keep composure, he could feel the manic feeling of terror slowly rising within him, as it had for almost an hour now. How long had they been fighting in this street for? How much ammo could they possibly have left, and what would happen if they ran out?\n\nFor now, however, those thoughts were quickly pushed away by a sharp tap from his NCO.\n\n "Schornberger! I need you to do some shit for us!" the man shouted, but whatever he shouted was drowned out by the next man over's yelling.\n\n"Holy shit! Johan just ate a fucking grenade up there!"\n\nMatthäus looked over the trench to the next foxhole, where his friend was noticeably absent. As he looked, however, he noticed movement in a ruined house, off to the left. None of his squadmates were in there- could a flanking attack be coming? A quick slap from the NCO brought him back to attention.\n\n "Like I was saying, Private, I need you to find a command element, tell them to give us reinforcements, supplies, something! We're running low! You hear me, private?""

 speer_moskowien.9.d:0 "Matthäus, without really even thinking about it, hopped over the wall and began his dash down the street. He didn't hear his NCO's shouting, whether it was positive or negative. All he heard was the thump of his own heart and the crackling of a machine gun, and suddenly the ground around him exploded in shards of stone and shrapnel as bullets crackled off the road around him. He didn't care, as long as they didn't hit him. By some divine miracle, or insane luck, they didn't. Matthäus managed to slide into the foxhole unscathed, slamming into the other wall from the sheer momentum he had carried. Quickly brushing himself off, he turned to find his friend.\n\nJohan was lying in a puddle of his own blood- a puddle that was now lapping around Matthäus's boots- with the look on his face of a rapidly dying man. His uniform, sliced to rags by the shrapnel, was now damp with blood from a thousand wounds. His arm, still holding his rifle, now lay severed behind him. As Matthäus watched in horror, Johan took one last look at him,eyes wide open, before finally falling silent.\n\n Matthäus was too terrified now to even throw up. His feeling of panic, which had been so well surpressed, now exploded just as ferociously as the grenade. In a blind moment of sheer terror, Matthäus scrabbled for the edge of the foxhole, looking for any means of escape, to run away, back past his line, out of Smolensk, all the way back to his house in Fulda.\n\nThe machine gun bullets cracked against the foxhole again, and Matthäus caught a stinging reminder of why the foxhole was there when one bullet grazed his fingers, sending him tumbling back into the blood puddle. Without covering fire, there was no way he could escape alive. Matthäus sank down against a wall, his eyes drawn to the corpse of what was once his friend. He couldn't look away. All he could do was sit and stare.\n\nThis wasn't at all like his father's stories."

 speer_moskowien.10.d:0 "With a jump, Matthäus was off, racing through the streets of Smolensk. Bullets cracked against the walls behind him, sending him stumbling into the next street. From there, he turned, running with his head down as he raced past corpses upon corpses. The screaming of the dying and the wounded rattled through his head as he ran, still looking for any sort of command element.\n\nFive blocks down, he stumbled into a makeshift hospital, hastily thrown together in the chaos of the fighting. He pushed through doctors tending to their patients, nurses carrying bodies off of beds and into a pile further away, and the occasionally walking wounded waiting for a table to open up. Finally, he broke free of the chaos, continuing his search.\n\nThe horrors of the battle he had fought through became more and more clear as he seemingly revisited them all on his path. On the way forward, it had been easy to ignore them, what with the battle and bullets flying everywhere. Now, on the way back, there was no haze to cover up the bodies, the blood, and the wreckage.\n\nEventually, Matthäus did find the command center. He barely even noticed himself monotonely requesting extra supplies for his position. When the commander heeded his request, sending men to relieve his unit, Matthäus hardly noticed. He instead sat down in a corner and tried to comprehend what he had seen."

The sounds of the battle roaring outside were now only muffled cracks and bangs reverberating through the walls. The house itself was dark- the electricity had been cut long ago- and the only light that filtered in came through cracks in the ceiling and walls. Matthäus's eyes strained to see clearly in the darkness as he slowly moved forwards.\n\nA whimper in the next room caught his attention, and Matthäus stopped dead in his tracks. He could hear faint breathing, labored and wheezing as it was. A small shuffle confirmed that the source of the noise was off to the right. Slowly, Matthäus steeled himself and popped around the corner.\n\nA beam of light illuminated a young Russian, no older than Matthäus himself, slick with blood. A picture lay in his right hand, a old rifle in his left. The two regarded each other for moment, neither moving a muscle, as if they shared a connection among the chaos of war.\n\nMatthäus raised his rifle and pumped six rounds into the boy, silencing his breaths. The picture fell from his hand, and Matthäus was barely able to make out the boy standing with his mother and father.\n\nMatthäus exited the house blankly, returning to the line. The Sergeant asked him if the building was clear, which Matthäus could only reply with a nod. Without another word, Matthäus returned to the line, firing the occasional shot down at the enemy."

The street, the battle,the things he had seen- all kept replaying in his head, like a long, terrible movie. He couldn't stop thinking about the crack of rifle fire, the screams of the wounded and dying, or the yelling of men who knew that, at any moment, they could be dead. After an hour of this torture, Matthäus resolved for another sleepless night. He quietly hopped out of his bunk, trudging to the bathroom. Perhaps he could fix himself there.\n\nOnce he got into the dim light of the bathroom, he took a long look at himself. A tired, unshaven face stared right back into his eyes. One simultaneously young in body but old in mind. Perhaps, with a few touch-ups and a good shave, he could look like the boy he once was, but one look into his own dull eyes was a surefire tell that he wasn't truly the boy from Fulda anymore.\n\nHe took a sip of water out of the sink, washing his face afterwards, before heading back to his bed. There, he lay down quietly, waiting for the sun to come up and a new day to start."

These were good people he had met- being new to Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität was quite the overwhelming experience. Matthäus had managed, but it seemed he had finally met some people he could fit in with.\n\n "So that's how high school ended for me. Matthäus, you're the new one here. What did you do before University?"\n\n "I, ah. . ." Mathaus paused for a moment. How would they react? Should he be honest? Christ, they're all looking at him now. No time to think.\n\n "I served with the Heer out east, in Smolensk."\n\nAnother moment of silence around the table- perhaps a silence for Matthäus's chances of making friends here. "Well, uh, that's interesting." said one.\n\n "Did you kill anyone?" said another, entirely too excited for the question he had asked."\n\n "What war?" said a third. Matthäus did not answer any of these questions. Instead, he picked up his bag and quickly walked out of the cafeteria. They didn't understand. Nobody here did, and nobody here ever would.

Here, in Germania, he had to make great efforts to prevail against both the military and the Slavs to the East. \n\nHere, Speer reminded himself, he had to keep eyes and ears everywhere.

We would not show too much force but instead we would show our intentions to give support to our own people in the East."\n\n Schörner shook his head at his words and told him to his face, "You are asking too much of our boys. You don't know what it's going to be like for them to face the Slavs. Those people would shoot our boys even if they behaved nicely and spoke to them politely. Neither they nor we are friendly neighbors now, are we?"\n\nBut Tresckow shot at him with words. "You're right, but this can save civilian lives." Schörner groaned at that and scoffed. Tresckow ignored him, adding to Speidel's points, "It can keep us from playing too much of a part in bringing the blood of innocent people on our troops. And it would show to the world that we are being intelligent about it."\n\n"What's intelligent is getting our men into the fire and out of there quickly rather than asking them to stay in the fire and do nothing," Schörner said, his face clearly showing that he wasn't having it from either of them.\n\n"It isn't going to be like that," Speidel told him, "because this will show the natives that we are not here to kill them all. They might even cooperate with us."\n\n"Hah! Good luck with that. No Slav would embrace us."\n\n"They won't, but it's worth trying. I'd rather keep civilian casualties low and our troops safe with careful officers rather than go headlong into a war that will spill the blood of everyone involved, either civilian or not," Tresckow added.\n\n"And this is only a plan.

But when no shot rang out, when no man shouted for cover or a medic, it seemed to them that the plan was working.\n\nStill, the Germans were cautious. And when they encountered civilians, reluctant men would remove themselves from the company of their comrades and their vehicles, carrying some rations or some kind of supplies to them. Most of the time, the meetings were brief, awkward, and all too nerve wracking on everyone. But at least those ended well. The rest of the encounters were either quite wholesome or quite bothersome.\n\nThe more they moved into the heart of the native territories, the more resistance and reluctance they found. Civilians either refused to welcome them, take their supplies, or reconsider shooting them. Snipers took advantage of kind German soldiers. And officers found themselves commanding squads of men yelling for permission to shoot back.\n\nAnd understandably, the officers were not enjoying this kind of control over what they had to do on the field.

And there would be no way to refuse a hanging.\n\nBy groups, they were noosed. By groups, they were given chances to speak their last words. By groups, they were told of their crimes again.

But he knew that Tresckow's was an option that would still lead to a significant number of losses. But this should serve as the one that would bleed Germany and the East less.\n\n"I see. Your idea has merit, Tresckow, and therefore...""

 speer_moskowien.22.d:0 "Nobody suspected danger. On Autobahn 95, over three hundred German soldiers and their tanks and other vehicles were well on their way to the front. They cradled their weapons and set their eyes forward or around the convoy, suspicious of the quiet Russian trees and shrubs that lined their path. They were deep in the forests now, but they heard little from the birds and the other kinds of animals that were living in them. What was going on?\n\n"Halt!" Many of the men who heard the order turned their heads. Right before their convoy, a burning carcass of a tank. The route was blocked. Then came sharp passing sounds from the left and right. Some men fell from their transports. Others dove behind large rocks or piles of dirt. A loud but brief explosion came from the back of the convoy. Then another.\n\n"Ambush! Ambush! Everyone dismount!" Officers and their noncoms hurried to get their men in order. Drivers stayed in their vehicles or abandoned them, forgetting their weapons or bringing them out. Riflemen and machine-gunners attempted to bring their sights against the enemy that was hitting them from everywhere. But they saw no Russian, only flashes of guns.\n\nScreams and shouts. Smoke from the burning vehicles. More explosions. Commands from noncoms pushing their men at the enemy. Officers on the radios.\n\nThe Germans got their minds back. They fought the Russians back. And they pushed them away from the convoy. But when they returned, they counted their losses. A dozen of their tanks and another dozen of their vehicles were lost. So many men lay on the ground or on their vehicles. This convoy had survived, but with these results, it could not go further into the East.\n\n"

It was almost peaceful, he thought, if only he had not gotten his country into a war out in the East. Again.\n\nHe looked down at the officers and their staffs making their way quickly into the building. The Fuhrer slipped back to his seat and waited for them to come in.\n\nWhen they did, the Fuhrer almost regretted it, because he heard Schörner blowing steam at the two others who followed after him.\n\n"I told you that your pretty compromise would not work! Look at what you've gotten the men into! An ambush!"\n\nTresckow, almost red faced, his expression set in Prussian stone, brought himself to his seat without speaking to him yet. Once there, he said, "This is not mine alone to bear. It was not my only responsibility to take care of the intervention. You both are officers of our country, are you not? Why didn't you get your hand into it yourself, Schörner?"\n\nSpeidel sat by Tresckow but too was not in a good mood about it. "Does it matter now, Tresckow? Look at the situation - we have hundreds of men dead. And we have lost valuable vehicles. Why were we not trying to be careful?"\n\n"If we moved too carefully, then we would have lost more men because we would be too slow!"\n\n"Gentlemen, enough." Speer stood up, getting the three to rise up from their seats too. "I know all of you are not in good spirits because of what happened, but if we let this stay over our heads, then there is no solving it." He now sat down, letting the others do so too. He looked at them all then said, "For now, listen. I know that you all have given the appropriate instructions for your people to take care of the survivors. I know that this probably deserves retaliation. But we also know that we have families now without their loved ones."\n\nThe officers nodded. They understood. And Speer now gave his order...\n\n"

They waved farewell to the family that welcomed them, seeing their faces, some of them still with red eyes and tears going down their cheeks, handkerchiefs wiping them away, for the last time. For now.\n\nSpeer sighed as he looked away, Tresckow glanced at the Fuhrer, seeing him with a frown so deep that he almost felt like comforting the man. But he was the Fuhrer, and as an officer under him, he thought it disrespectful to try to do too much for him.\n\nThe Fuhrer himself felt his own heart come under another weight. He had visited so many families all over Germania. Later, he would have to see to the other families in the rest of the Reich. He wondered how many times he could say those words. "I'm so sorry for your loss..."\n"I regret telling you that your son has fallen in..."\n"My deepest condolences go to you and  your family."\n"My sympathies are with you..."\n\nSpeer shook his head at himself, ignoring Tresckow's curious glance. The car had stopped. Tresckow reminded him as the Fuhrer stepped out, "This is the Kraus family. The soldier...he had-"\n\n"A pregnant wife and two daughters. I know." He turned to one of his escorts, who had left the car before he did, "Do we have the..." The escort nodded, looking up at the windows of the house. The Fuhrer followed as did Tresckow.\n\nFrom there, the silent eyes of the woman observed them. She seemed to tremble as she looked down at them.\n\nSpeer held his eyes up then sighed, reached for his hat, and took it off his head. Then he lowered his gaze and walked to the door and knocked gently. He waited for the woman to come down and open the door. When he saw her face, Speer thought he had seen the face of his own wife, in the same manner this woman showed her inevitable grief.\n\n"

The tape has been delivered to the war room just after the results from the authorized strike on Novgorod was accomplished. With Speidel and Schörner watching it with him as the planes finally came over the city and released their bombs, flying away in another direction after great balls of fire and heat burst out of the places in the city where the bombs landed.\n\nAnother flight of planes came over, taking turns in dropping bombs that split into smaller ones. The smaller ones scattered more easily over the city, obliterating those that were not on fire or else driving more of the flames into the rest of the area.\n\n"This is insane," Tresckow spoke, drawing Speer's eyes from the monitor. The Prussian was shaking his head, his eyes filled with dread and regret.\n\n"We have to do this," The Fuhrer said with resignation. His eyes returned to the monitor, ignoring Tresckow's following words.\n\n"As if we do not have any other choice! This isn't how we are supposed to respond to the enemy's forces! We're just killing civilians!"\n\n"What does it matter? Civilians are helping the enemy fight us off and kill our men. They deserve it, Tresckow," Schörner stated. Speidel said nothing, merely shaking his head.\n\n"It's still unnecessary! And it stains our honor as soldiers of Germany! This isn't the kind of war we should fight."\n\n"It is now," The Fuhrer said, "because this is the best way we can show force against the Slavs for what they've done."\n\nSchörner smiled. But Tresckow refused to let it go.\n\n"I will not stand for this. This is just not the right way of war. I will not have it, my Fuhrer. You must not let this happen! You should have not listened to him!"'\n\nThough he glared at Schörner, the Fuhrer said nothing. Speidel turned to him and told him, "What is done is done. We can't stop it now."\n\n"It could have been avoided. It could have been left undone." Tresckow then turned away, leaving the war room, slamming the doors behind him.\n\n"

He looked up to the others.\n\n"The enemy is still not giving up the fight." The Fuhrer's eyes were on the map. He crossed his arms and shook his head. "No matter how careful we are, this whole thing is coming to a halt."\n\n"If you only just listened to me and kept going, we would have won this whole thing," Schörner boasted.\n\nTresckow glared at him and said, "We could lose more men if we force them to go into the jaws of the Russian resistance. Do you want them to go in there like blind men?"\n\n"Well, our soldiers are not blind, are they?" Shorner shot back.\n\n"Enough," Speer told them, his eyes remaining on the map, studying the lines and the units arranged for them all to see. He sighed at himself and said, "Things are not going according to plan. This intervention is not going to be done within the time we wanted it to be done."\n\n"I'm afraid that is so, my Fuhrer."\n\n"

Focus on giving them the freedom to maneuver and to engage the enemy!"\n\nSpeer frowned. "Schörner, I know I am interested in a swift end to the bloodshed, but if we do that..."\n\n"If we do that, we save more lives - German lives! We should not care too much about the casualties of those causing trouble for our Fatherland in the East. Away with them, the pests!"\n\nTresckow turned to Speer as Speidel too scowled at the man. But Speer kept his attention only towards Schörner, hating him for what he suggested. He had a point, but what about our reputation? "What you suggest is as terrible as committing the same methods our men once used in the West Russian War and before! Are you not aware what you are risking with, Generalfeldmarschall?"\n\nThe determined army officer just shrugged at the Fuhrer and gestured towards the maps, especially to the units displayed. "I only suggest what works. It is better than delaying our men, delaying their support, and above all, delaying Germany's hand in saving our settlers. Is that not our purpose?"\n\nThe other two now turned to Speer, who still maintained a disgusted expression against Schörner. Not only was he suggesting a nightmare for Germany's morality, his disdain for the man in charge was coming clear. And the Fuhrer clenched his jaws and turned to the maps. Only he could decide what do with his forceful suggestion.\n\n"

No longer.\n\nIn the sight of the rising sun, the morning gave the Germans the advantage in surprise and in time. Tanks and men were converging on the unsuspecting people as they woke up and came out of their houses or returned from fishing at the lake. With ruthless rapidity, the cannons sounded, delivering shells that collapsed and burst buildings apart, pieces flying in all directions as machine guns and grenades did the job of murdering men, women, and children.\n\nIntelligence had suspected enemy forces here, and the Germans sought it out, but found nothing, but they could not stop, so they kept hammering the small town.\n\nAgain and again, the Germans landed blow after blow against it. And as they did, the people attempted to flee. They ran to the boats and when those were destroyed, they swam into the lake. Others ran out of the town, chased down by troops and vehicles, crushed by treads or by wheels, shot in the back if they were too slow or slipped into the ground.\n\nThe wounded who dared to crawl away or limp behind some rubble were bayoneted or finished off with pistols. Nobody the Germans found was spared.\n\nBut the Russian earth would not hide the secrets of the invaders. Even if they attempted to, the ground would spit them out, disgusted and horrified...\n\n"

You have given me the-"\n\n"I do not want you to use that as an excuse! You cannot tell me that you let our forces massacre an entire settlement of Russian civilians because of what I permitted you to do. I permitted you only to engage the enemy." The Fuhrer now clapped his right hand, open now, down on the table, startling those who passed by and saw this unfold. "But what you did is beyond engaging the enemy!"\n\nSchörner stared his superior down and stood his ground at the table. "Intelligence reported that-"\n\n"No," said Tresckow, intelligence was incorrect. They gave you another target. But you ignored that. What you've done is a grave error on your part, not theirs."\n\nSpeidel now spoke up, to support Speer and Tresckow, "You also ignored statements by your own reconnaissance that no enemy resistance was found in the town. Evidence was laid down in front of you again and again but you did not respond. You ignored what they said. You set aside all the warnings!"\n\n"Would you rather I let that town come under Russian control? You don't know what's on the ground!" Schörner now pointed at Speidel, rudely so. "Why don't you try to see what happens when we don't make sure of what is there in the town or not?"\n\n"So you admit you destroyed it?" Speer asked sharply, a revolted smile on his face. "Well? You've done it. You've killed men, women, and children that had nothing to do with our enemy!"\n\n"I did what I had to do. I don't care what you all say! This is necessary. It will end the war in shorter time than-"\n\n"Than what? That is foolishness, Schörner!" Tresckow shook his head at him and turned away.\n\nSpeidel crossed his arms and stepped closer to Schörner. The man reacted by pushing him away, provoking his counterpart to grapple him. But before things could escalate, the Fuhrer said, "Enough! This is the war room!

Such strikes destroyed the majority of the town, with reports from the detachment detailing both the elimination of the enemy and of unfortunate civilians.\n\nThat was supposed to be the story. And that will have to be the story. It is important for us to control the flow of events and the validity of such events. As soldiers of the Reich, we cannot allow the truth to become a tool for our enemies to use against us.

It was supposed to be avoidable, but like any mistake, like any error, it was no longer avoidable once it was done.\n\nThe world returned to their opinion of Germany. In the light, Germany still was a horrible European power that used force to put down threats to herself. And Speer, looking back at it, felt a long sigh shudder out of his lungs. The regrets weighed on him. Banished in pain, his heart burned as strongly as it burned when the war ended.\n\nFeeling lost, he closed his eyes, hoping to sleep and forget about such memories.

 speer_moskowien.35.d:0 "The poorly built train provided no comfort for the Oberleutenant, as while the train whipping back and forth was usually no issue for supply shipments, personnel had been a different story. Not to mention the freezing temperatures that had plagued every one of the advisors as they prepared to reach Reichskommissariat Moskowien. But, as the Oberleutenant knew, comfort wasn't the priority of the Reich, was it? The train coming to a screeching halt painted a picture of his platoon's desperate stand at Bremen while he fought for Speer's succession. Exiting the train, he took one last look at his pocketwatch containing a picture of his wife before stepping off. \n\n The rumbling of the train made it hard to hear anything else, but for the Oberleutenant, the marching of boots managed to triumph the surrounding area, as more and more soldiers within Moskau prepared themselves through the bustling streets, as if the whole city was on the move. "Oberleutenant Vogt?" called a distant voice, grasping the Oberleutenant's attention as he came to see a young Leutenant saluting him. "At ease, Leutenant. You're here to bring me to my station, correct?" Vogt said. "Aye, sir, please, follow me, sir." prompting the young officer to face about and begin walking alongside Vogt. Everywhere Vogt looked, he only realized that the chaotic mess was growing, as dirtied Aryan settlers hurried to earn a few extra Reichsmarks whilst platoons of the Reichskommissariat's soldiers marched past. "Poor bastards never had it this hard, did they?" Vogt asked. "Not exactly, sir, preparations for a possible assault by the Russians has shaken up the lives of everyone in the settlement, though everyone is hopeful for the advisors that have come in." The prevalence of such "hope" did not appear evident for Vogt as he saw scared German children and fathers having to say one last goodbye before hurrying off with a rifle in tow. \n\nEventually, Vogt managed to escape the chaos-ridden frost as he entered his small office room within one of the military installations of Moskowien. To say that the ones present during the civil war in Germany were better was an overstatement, with staff tripping over themselves, rats scurrying down the hallways, and barely enough room to stand in. "Sir, command has issued that advisors are to aid in the training of divisions newly formed in the wake of the possible attack from the natives.

Had it not been that easy to operate the weapons left from the Second World War to prepare the Reichskommissariat for such an attack like this? Apparently fucking not, according to Vogt, given how this morning has gone so far. Fighting and killing fellow Germans felt easier than dealing with this catastrophe. \n\nIt was four in the morning when the battalion he had been assigned to start off with were finished lining up, with some of the men obviously not knowing what standing at attention meant. Lighting his cigarette, Vogt yelled out, "Men, my name is Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt. As I have seen blood spilt within our homeland through war, so too now do the Russians seek to spill our blood to retain their damned power, looking to unite against our families, our Fatherland! And as proud Germans seeking to do their homeland proud, we cannot allow this. Today begins your training for when you face the frontlines, in the reality of which some of you will die. However, that is not the concern now. Today, you shall become true workers of the Reichskommissariat, true soldiers, and true Germans. Now, first platoon of the first company, mount the firing range." \n\nVogt's inspiring words seemingly died in his eyes as the men lined up for weapon training. Some of these men hadn't touched a rifle in years, while others hadn't done so at all, and only worked the farms while producing large families, as the Reich had given permission to do so. None had known the true brutalities that were to come, as Vogt had seen during the civil war, especially when some of them barely figured out how to slide the bolt open. However, the worst came when the men had finally regularly begun firing at the targets when a shower of blood splattered across the field, some staining Vogt's coat, with screaming following. Men rushed over, and saw one that one of the recruits shot themselves in the hand, nearly blowing it off; however, despite the horrificness of the situation, the man managed to retain as much composure as he could, even firing off a joke or two in the process. \n\n Vogt knew the truth of the situation: the man shot himself in order to get out of service, in order to escape the horrors that everyone else was bound to endure. Yet, the Oberleutenant knew the truth of it all, that he couldn't shatter the mens' spirits knowing they had cowards in their ranks, and chose to send him away to deal with later. Afterwards, the men along the firing line simply stared at Vogt."

In times past, it represented the strength of the empires long past within German history, having served as a symbol of perseverance and courage. Now, as Vogt knew all too well, the symbol flew as to represent the Fatherland, along with the battalion of conscripts and volunteers within the newly formed "Adlersgruppe," charged with protecting their friends and families from the Russian onslaught that inevitably stormed its way forward. As the men continued setting up defenses in some backwater village to the south of Moskau, they continuously talked about potentially being called heroes on their return home. The word "hero" brought a whiplash of pessimism for Oberleutenant Vogt, nearly distracting him before the sounds of one of the infantrymen being torn apart by submachine gun fire exploded out. \n\nA period of shock-ridden silence boomed, until screams in Russian came from across the town, and the Germans hurried to their assigned positions, with Vogt's orders starting to become drowned out by the incoming gunfire. Chunks of concrete came flying off of surrounding buildings, some even tearing apart the faces of the new recruits, as they continually battled in the streets, with bullets flying and the blood of both Germans and Russians showering the air in a flurry of fire and gore. Vogt had known the terror of guerilla warfare for years, and now, as a Russian truck with a light-machine gun in the bed firing down into the Germans, Vogt had the chance to utilize his experience. With cries drowning the air, Vogt shouted at some of the closest men to him, "Find your strength men, now's our time to make the advance! Unteroffizier Breiner, take some men and gather the explosives! Unteroffizier Kranz, gather some men with me and we'll surround the truck, it cannot-" a bullet interrupted Vogt's speech as a rain of gunfire forced him to find better cover. As he regained his defense, the only thing the Oberleutenant saw when he laid his eyes on his men were the same emotions portrayed by his brothers-in-arms during their time fighting for Speer back in Germany. The same emotion that came as the feelings of heroism faded, and the chilling shadow of death crept closer and closer, with every comrade lost to another bullet, whether it's fired from a Russian or a German. \n\nTerror. \n\n Wiping his face some more, Oberleutenant Vogt shouted "Fall back, fall back! We'll find another way around!" as the German soldiers began to retreat in the face of the overwhelming firepower from the Russians. They may not be heroes, but they didn't need to be heroes to deserve to live another day, to Vogt, anyway."

The death, the destruction, the disease, and all the other terrors. But Vogt could never have expected the brutalities to rise so quickly: the amount of mass executions, the killings of deserters, those once considered to be comrades in fighting against the Russians, the viscera, all had come crashing down upon the volunteers in such a short period. Much to the respect of Oberleutenant Vogt, while it all seemed difficult, the men continued to march forward past it all; that is, until the Burning of Ryazan. \n\n As the Adlergruppe marched southwards from Moskau, pushing deeper into Russian territory "in the defense of the Reichs' rightful territory,'' the men had already become surrounded as the urban battle exploded. Sure, the men got their first taste of battle in a village, but this was an entirely different story as the concrete buildings and structures hid enemy Russians behind every corner. Constantly, squads of enemy soldiers seemed to appear as phantoms in the dark, pinning a few squads of the Germans down before they finally dealt with the issue. This was, until Alpha Company, led by Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt, entered the courtyard of an apartment complex to secure the area, and became pinned down by heavy enemy fire from all sides of the three-sided building. The men rushed to cover or died trying to do so, with the screams of fellow Aryans dying in the stony courtyard filling the air, as what seemed like the endless Russian supply of lead came raining hell upon the company. Vogt was left with no other choice but to hold out as he continuously pleaded for air support from local German air wings, who promised "immediate combat support." \n\nIt took a seemingly endless five minutes for the screams of the German jets to overtake the slaughter, as the Gates of Hell seemed to open up from the heavens above and consume the apartment complex. The men watched along in horror, some trying to get up and move as the fiery napalm they pleaded for arrived, sticking to the enemy soldiers who threw themselves off the multiple story balconies to escape the horrid fate of burning to death. However, as Vogt thought the horror was over, it only multiplied in size, as the outer doors of the apartment complex opened up and a flood of burning men, women, and children came screeching out of the complex. Only some had been armed, but none cared any longer, as they peeled away at the flesh and bone that melted away from the deadly German napalm, with mothers holding their children, hoping for an end to the madness. Eventually, all had either died from the flames or were killed out of mercy by some of those within the Aldersgruppe, who had all seemed to shock and terrified to be able to respond to any other orders from some of the superiors. \n\nThe nightmares that night consumed Vogt's mind. Flashbacks to that last stand at Bremen stormed his mind only to reach a burning conclusion, with the flooding of anachronistic burning children and women into the once-heroic battlefield, causing the Oberleutenant to rocket from his dreams every hour of the night."

All had such beautiful, loving wives, and even more beautiful children, in the eyes of Marina, always longing to start a family with her husband. Finally, the glowing numbers of "418" came into view with a screeching halt, and she excitedly danced over, finally seeing her beloved Marzell come into view. She immediately rushed to embrace her Marzell, who jumped at the sight of his rushing wife, causing her confusion, saying, "You're finally back, Marzell! Come here!" she said, embracing her husband. "Yes, I'm, I'm home now." Marzell said, as Marina felt her husband's hand shake. \n\nHours had gone by, and yet, the newly returning husband still remained...odd, according to Marina. Everytime a new question came forward, like, "How did it feel to serve the Fatherland once more?" he simply responded with a quick "It was good." or "Great." She couldn't name the look in his eyes, one of distance, as if his eyes were a camera out of focus, but she simply tried to provide everything she could to be a good wife. That evening, as the couple climbed into bed, Marina's attempts to embrace and comfort her husband resulted in a simple repulse on the side of her husband, followed by his attempts to get some sleep as he tossed and turned in the bed. \n\n Later into the night, Marina woke to the sound of broken glass and an otherwise empty bed, as she threw off the covers and rushed towards the kitchen, where she heard the loud noise. Realizing her husband was nowhere in sight, she grabbed a letter opener they kept on the desk before entering the kitchen...where she found her husband, with glass shards shattered across the table and ground, whiskey, which her husband swore to never drink in his career, spilled across the area, and a bloodied hand carrying a pistol kept from service. Marina dropped the letter opener on the ground as she approached her husband, asking "Marzell, oh god, what's wrong?" Marzell responded with nothing, only beginning to sob into her chest as he dropped the pistol on the ground, and embraced her tightly, shaking all the while."

 speer_moskowien.40.d:0 "The northbound train delivered a journey that, although mildly uncomfortable and thoroughly frigid, was historic, and truly felt antiquated as the snowy Russian countryside came into view through the train's windows. And within one small compartment, the bustling and rocking of the powerful locomotive hardly shook the work Walther Viktorow had prepared. Viktorow sat excitedly, tapping on his briefcase filled with documents and procedural forms as he stared out into the Western Russian wilderness, completely losing track of the outside world as the train came to a screech, and the city streets filled his view. Finally, after so much wrongdoing against the harrowed Russian, Viktorow knew that the time had come to make a difference in the world, even if the greatest trial awaited him, and he had one thought which dominated his mind: \n\nMoskau awaits. \n\nHowever, as Viktorow exited the train, accompanied by a group of German guardsmen straight from Germania, the full force of the trial would strike as he looked around the train station. Everywhere, men, women, and children, all with bright, beautiful blue eyes, and adorned with flowing golden hair, all looked as if they had come from a German slum. Exhaustion colored their faces while callouses covered their hands, with some appearing frail and hungry, and all adorning ragged clothes that would bring disgust to most German higher ups. But Viktorow did not want the prestige or class of higher up, this is exactly what Viktorow wanted, even if he could not stand the pleading eyes of the settlers here. At the end of the day, they were the Reich's citizens, and as proud as they may be, they were suffering, and Viktorow knew that he, as an ambassador on behalf of the Reich itself, he could not allow this any longer. \n\nAs the snow landed atop his cap, the toy of a young child bounced across the street in front of the capitol, nearly prompting a guard to strike the child, were it not for Viktorow's intervention. Handing the child his toy from next to Viktorow's feet, the diplomat said a few simple words to the boy: "Do not be afraid, things will change here soon." as he looked onwards to the capitol building of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, as the recent clashings of Germans and Russians flooded his mind."

Improvements regarding the stability of the transportation systems between the Reich and the Reichskommissariat could potentially be looked into; however, if anything, the difficulty presented in the transportation systems is a small look into the situation within Moskowien. Politically, the situation within the area appears stable enough to not withdraw supply efforts towards the settlers of the area, nor do any reports indicate a collapse for the Reich's influence within the area around Moskau; however, living standards have fallen dramatically for the Aryan settlers within the Reichskommissariat as well as native Russians. Outbreaks of conflict between native Russian populaces and the settlers arriving from Germany proper has caused considerable detriment for German settlements, and Russians within the area have suffered as well, despite the advancements made within the area. In this regard, although living conditions have plummeted for all parties within Moscowien and the surrounding Russian nation-state, the populace has espoused supreme loyalty towards the Reich itself, and in an effort to support the German and the Russian within the area, the developing situation has been taken with the greatest priority for our diplomatic envoy. Thus, actions towards the advancement of OPERATION: GREATWHITE will begin immediate implementation within the interactions between Reichskommissar Kasche's successor, native leadership within the newly established state for Russians outside of Reichskommissar Moscowien, and the diplomatic envoy you have assigned me to, and transportation to the capital of the nation-state of the Russians will be arranged to aid our mutual efforts through a hopeful admittance into the Unity-Pakt.

Viktorow knew that as the days went on, the time before he'd venture forward to meet with the officials of the Russian nation grew shorter and shorter; yet, despite his excitement for the eventual departure and work, everything left him confounded in the reasoning behind the excitement. \n\n"Excuse me, Dr. Viktorow, but the convoy has been prepared for transportation." a young secretary said as he had missed her knocks on the door. "My apologies, Miss Berchow, right away." the diplomat said, as he grabbed his suitcase and followed her out. Everything around him had showcased what he enjoyed, the order, the structure of it all, and now was finally his time to make a difference. Time to make a difference that his predecessors of the past did not, he continued, thinking of the pictures of his family he kept so neatly tucked away back home in Germania. The carvings of the beautiful little box delighted Viktorow, in contrast with the contents, as he saw capturings of the times of a Russian family working its hardest to get through the wall set up by German forces. How great of suffering his grandparents had been as they crossed over into the new land of Germany, and the dreaded persecutions that the Viktorovs faced being foreign immigrants in a hostile land. But no more, no more crushed dreams nor broken souls from either side, as each and every hardworking German and Russian around Moskowien has earned their right to support from the Fatherland, and earned an end to the troubles which plagued them. \n\nViktorow continued his thoughts as he finally made it outside the capital alongside his fellow statesmen and the Waffen regiment accompanying them deep into the Russian land. The frost encapsulating the trucks reminded VIktorow of his grandfather and grandmother as the convoy began to move away from Moskowien territory."

 speer_moskowien.43.d:0 "The soft rumbling of treading through dirt and snow tore apart into harsh rocking and bucking by the envoy's truck as it met hard gravel amidst that sounded like it would tear off the tires at any minute. As the entourage continued onwards, the silence slowly transformed from an excited admiration of the Russian land to a dreaded silence, with each rotation of the tires bringing another wave of confusing tensions as the Waffen guards present in Viktorow's truck prepped themselves. It was confusing to Viktorow, to say the least, until the trucks finally passed through the iron gates of the city. \n\nThere, peering through the windows of a heavily armored truck, Viktorow, for the first time in his life, received a glimpse as to what his grandmother and grandfather escaped all those years ago: the glimpses of children roaming the streets without parents in sight, in rags, fighting over a piece of bread which had been stained by the mud of the ground. Across the street, Viktorow caught glimpses of three men beating another fellow Russian on the ground, pummeling him with bats, punches, and kicks as they strip him of his bag and coat and duck off into the alleyway, passing by a duo of nurses carrying a body covered with a tarp out of a health center. The homeless had grown in number as he saw groups of armed men harassing a young woman coming out of her home, seemingly asking for overdue money owed to them, and Viktorow could only pray for her safety as the convoy moved on. Viktorow continued to think and debate with himself as to what had become the fate of the Russian people, what could have done this? Were the politicians in charge of the state that greedy, or was there some sort of crisis causing all of this? Viktorow continued to pray for the hope that things had not been completely this way for his ancestors. \n\nAs the motorcade came to a halt outside of the capitol building, Viktorow continued to dust himself off and grab his briefcase as his eyes locked onto a peculiar sight: a little girl, no older than seven, grabbed at the chain link fence as she continued to stare at the Germans inside. She looked thinly, and had only dirty rags on, yet her brown eyes glimmered in the snow, reminding Viktorow of the daughter he always wanted. That was, until a little boy began to chase her for the bread in her hands."

He stared into seeming nothingness, as the words upon the transcripts laid out in front of him blurred, all the man could see was images of his days within the surrounding area. The desperateness and near predatory nature of some of the groups that had formed outside of the Moskowien territory, how could the self-governed area fall apart so quickly, yet the room he sits in remain so lavish? \n\nSuddenly, the wrinkled face of the anti-Soviet himself, Bronisalv Kaminski entered the room, offering a nod and handshake to the diplomat. "Brigadeführer Kaminski, it is an honor to meet you, my name is Dr. Walther Viktorow-" Viktorow said, before being cut off by Kaminski, who stated, "Ah, the diplomat sent by Speer, huh? We've been waiting for the day of your arrival, what's the terms?" Viktorow hadn't pictured such exhaustion from Kaminski, but then again, all of the area has been a surprise, hasn't it? Taken aback, Viktorow took out the first report in the file, and began discussing the Führer's desires out of Kaminski to pay for the incredible amount of support issued issued to the native state via the ceding of Brauchitschstadt and a swearing of loyalty to the Unity-Pakt. Viktorow's seemingly hopeful words brought him to look up, only to meet the image of Kaminski hunched over the desk, both hands clasping his face, with only whispers to be heard between Viktorow's relaying message: "They'll march in and hang me...joining the Unity-Pakt....the natives, they've given..." And finally, as if a sledgehammer broke through a castle made of sand, everything came together for Viktorow. The terms, the ceding of territory, the governmental lavishness, yet the hopeless and the butchers remaining outside, this wasn't Kaminski's misdoings, they've been paying everything towards the Reich for all the aid they received at first. They couldn't stand on their own, they needed help, and now...wait, Operation: Great White. Viktorow wasn't serving as a negotiator here, he was a predator: a loan shark. \n\nIn the end, Kaminski, with eyes that seemingly had the life sucked out of them, shook to the agreement of losing Brauchitschstadt and joining the Pakt. With every step, from leaving the capital building, to walking to the trucks, to staring out the windows as they rumbled out, Walther Viktorow felt one thing alone: the eyes of starving, broken Russians."

Meeting with BRONISALV KAMINSKI retained success within the notions outlined in OPERATION: GREATWHITE, as the native state has agreed to cede Brauchitschstadt to the direct control of the German Reich while issuing a submittance of willingness to joining the Unity-Pakt in support of Germany proper in exchange for the cancellation of debts owed from the local government towards Germania. German settlers retained celebratory feelings over the success and technical end to conflicts against their Russian neighbors, as local reports showed demonstrations of praise regarding the Reichskommissariat's government. Outside of Moskau, reports of Russian citizens' outrage over the terms of KAMINSKI'S agreement have been issued to local media outlets, with even some factions within Brauchitschstadt reporting direct obstinance towards the notions of direct annexation by the German Reich proper. Overall tension within the area remains to be seen, as continuous data has been feeding into the Reichskommissariat's office to measure the success of the terms. Within personal reason and experience, it is within bounds of my personal measures to report that OPERATION: GREATWHITE provides immediate successes for the German Reich; however, continuous documentation will be required to measure long-term successes. Insofar as measurements reach, the continuous losses of the native populaces following the Second World War, the Western Russian War, and now the loss of Brauchitschstadt and the diplomatic alignment with the Unity-Pakt may offer a fostering point for native resistances. In dearly recognizing the sufferings of the native populace, current success estimates remain at a current situated level of IMPROBABLE."

 speer_moskowien.46.d:0 "War never means peace for a foreign ministry, no matter how far removed from the conflict. Helmut Schmidt had become all too familiar with this. A pound on the door outside his office served as the fifteenth reminder that day that the world after Hitler was still a chaotic maelstrom of politics and blood, a great typhoon in which Germania was the eye of the storm. Peaceful for now, but surrounded by disorder on all sides. \n\n"Come in, come in." \n\n"Foreign minister, a report from Moskowien. I'm sure you'll find it fascinating reading." \n\n"Thank you. You're one of Gehlen's boys, with the RND?" \n\nThe young man opposite him remained silent, and smiled coldly. Schmidt internally rolled his eyes and took the paper from him. "Very well. Off you go then." \n\nWith a short bow, the man left. Schmidt stared at the paper in front of him. 'Kaminski victorious', a newspaper clipping on the front read. Ah, so old Brinislaw had won out against the German settlers. A bad situation for Germany, perhaps, what with the whole legacy of a totalitarian Reichkomissariat and all leaving a sour taste in Russian mouths. Still, Schmidt thought it was perhaps preferable to Von Dem Bach or one of the other wretched Nazis patrolling the ruins of Russia. If not for his government, then for humanity as a whole. \n\nHe filed through the papers, and one stood out particularly. An intercepted telegram, between one of Brinislaw's men and some sympathetic Russian national in Lettland. Now this was interesting. Seems Kaminski had become convinced the best way for his Moscow autonomy out of the chaos enveloping the rest of Russia was a negotiation session with Germania's finest. Perhaps Schmidt would see the best of both worlds, then."

 speer_moskowien.47.d:0 "Germans and Russians had just about always been wrapped up in each others' business. When the Empire still controlled the Baltic states, the Germans there had been kept as something of a nobility. Schleswig-Holstein, back before the Wilhelmine era, had been a land controlled by an offshoot of the Romanovs. Fate still has it that the Lord of Europe and the fractured Giant of the East will forever be woven together in a tangled tapestry. \n\nSchmidt arrived in a country town in Western Moskowien by plane. Russian troops lined the streets, eying down the foreign minister's convoy as it moved toward the central bar, which had seemingly been refitted into a political centre of operations for Kaminski's forces in this region. Schmidt was confident that he was safe; the Heer around him was equipped with better weapons than these peasant conscripts, that was for sure. Either way, blood spilled today would not be the preferable option. \n\nNegotiations were over lunch. Shashlik, Pelmeni and even Chicken Kiev. Schmidt didn't have Russian cuisine often, but it remained one of his favourites on the continent. Beyond the food, Schmidt was impressed with Kaminski. The man spoke German well, and seemed cultured in literature and philosophy, something that even in the supposed 'world capital' politicians often lacked. The man's taste was clearly in the sciences, however, but Schmidt was capable of holding basic conversation on the scientific feats of Tesla through to Braun. Schmidt liked Kaminski, and it seemed the favour was mutual. \n\nA minor tremor in the conversation was felt. Schmidt let it be known that Brauchitschstadt, or what the Russians still call 'Leningrad', would be directly administered by Germania. The city seemed to hold sentimental value to the old soldier opposite him, who had served his time with the Red Army before Stalin's purges. Lenin was still an admired figure. \n\nDespite this, Kaminski was still willing for the negotiations to move forward. Even with the administration disagreements, Kaminski admitted that he felt aligning his new Russia with Speer was the right thing to do. Schmidt couldn't agree more."

His brows furrowed. "Herr Schmidt, would you repeat that for me please?" \n\nSchmidt felt his heart sink as he realised what he had done. "Perhaps the Heer might take an advisory role in the new Moscow government, if you would be so willing." \n\n"I heard what you said the first time, I was just checking to see if you were the rat you appeared to be." Kaminski sighed. "You know, Schmidt, out here in the East, people call you a hero. There's optimism that you might be something different to those Nazi scum who run your country. That you might be an angel on Speer's shoulder, and you might do something genuinely good for Russia, or even the world." \n\nSchmidt watched as the man opposite him stood from his unfinished lunch. Kaminski faced away, equipping his coat as he continued. "No man is immune to propaganda. I read an American minister talk about it, and you know Schmidt, I hate the Americans, but this one had a point. 'Propaganda makes puppets of us'. It has made a puppet out of you. My blood might come from Warsaw, Minsk, and the very soil this building stands on, but do you think just because I am a Slav that I am stupid?" \n\n"Take yourself and those uptight pricks in uniform behind you back to whatever fucking hell you came from."

Send my best wishes back to the RND with you." \n\nThe young man saluted, and exited the room. Speer was left with a folder of documents pertaining to the breakdown of the recent partition in Moskowien. Ah. Erich von dem Bach has claimed victory, or so the clipping at the front of the folder would have the Führer believe. Perhaps his Cyrillic was a bit rusty, but flicking through the rest of the documentation suggested that this was the accurate outcome. \n\n"Finally, some good news," Speer muttered to himself. A loyal Wehrmacht general sat in Moscow now, and the Führer could see no reason why resistance was even conceivable. He picked the phone up from his desk. \n\n"

As good a place as any for diplomatic arrangements. Perhaps more importantly, Erich von dem Bach hadn't seen his hometown for years, and so Schmidt thought it might be beneficial to arrange a meeting there. The bewildered old soldier was guided by the foreign minister into the party office building that  had been reserved for the meeting. A table was decorated with a grand lunch for Moskowien's interim ruler. Wurst, potatoes and plenty of beer. "Schmidt, this was unnecessary. Thank you." \n\n"Anything for a fellow German on the homebound flight. Now, down to business?" \n\nAt Bach's nod, Schmidt began. With an apology, the foreign minister revealed that Bach's position would be filled by Alexis von Roenne, to which Bach was seemingly compliant. Additionally, the Reich would directly occupy Brauchistschstadt, and create a new german settler state in the Southern Volga region. To both of these territorial changes, Bach was quite amicable. "Happy to do my duty, sir." \n\nSchmidt smiled to himself. If he knew this was going to be so easy, he would've started drinking much earlier."

Schmidt thought he'd have hated Bach, but the man was honest and kind. They had been alone for some time, and Bach admitted his Kashubian heritage, which no one in the party, he was sure, knew. Sometimes, in Bach's weaker moments, even he doubted the party. Schmidt felt he had met a kindred spirit. The deal was sealed with signatures, and the men departed home. \n\nSchmidt didn't like night time flights, so he was staying in Lauenburg til the morning. He sat up in his hotel bed with the folder the RND had given him. It was a dossier on Bach, and although he had considered the diplomatic sections with great detail, he had only skimmed the personal section. Schmidt's eyebrows furrowed as he glanced over a section tabbed as 'Activities before Moskowien', detailing the man's actions before the war. Schmidt felt his heart race. The man he had joked and drunk with just hours earlier had been responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents, and these were only the documented ones. In Operation Hummingbird, Bach had personally killed several in the SA. Then there was his horrific career in the SS, which Schmidt had heard of but never actively considered. \n\nNo one in this Reich was innocent. Not even the kindest of faces, or the warmest of voices. It was just Schmidt, and Schmidt alone, dancing with the murderers that had destroyed his father's country. He felt his eyes begin to tear up, but suppressed the urge to cry. He had done too much of that recently. At least the deal had gone smoothly. Another nation returned to the Unity Pakt for his favourite murderer, the Führer."

At one point, the Führer interrupted the barrage: "Minister, please stop! Are we truly in such a state? Has the Reich really fallen behind so much?"\n"Please come with me mein Führer"\nAs the two moved to the window, the Minister pointed at the cars: "Do you recognise them?" and that was enough answer. To his consternation, Speer saw that most, if not all cars and trucks passing were models ten - if not more - years old. Looking with more attention, he also noticed details he had missed when looking outside in the past weeks: patchwork reparations to the roads and sidewalks, electric cables hanging from scrambled-together power lines, public phones scattered because the people had no telephones inside their homes...\n\nRight at that moment, as if to confirm that indeed, the situation was dire, all lights went out in the office, and the surprised voices from outside the door made it clear that it was a general blackout.

"Your mission will be as follows:\n\nAt [redacted] past midnight, you will infiltrate past the security in the house. You will be given significant amounts of explosives, and you will need to plant them across several weak points throughout the house. Once you have done so, you will leave the residential area and activate the explosives using a detonator that will be given to you.\nLeave no trace of your presence, as the police will be given full authority to investigate the scene in order to appease the students.

Of course it was necessary. Anything else would not be tolerated, but now the state had to deal with the fall-out that followed. At the very least it wasn't as bad as he may have initially thought, but seeing every day pop up with another article about how some pushy college student affiliated with Antifa was arrested by the men in black.

"Cannot say I'm necessarily displeased with your performance-" Wessel didn't react, but he could tell the man wasn't being fully honest when he said that.

It was plain in sight, clear as day, black as night!.\n\nBut when he showed up to protest at his college that afternoon, most of his colleagues weren't around with him. Only a scant few were scattered around the campus, holding signs and waving fresh flags that spoke about the incident at the house. That would've brought him solidarity if it wasn't that so few were around to share the message. Instead, as he stood and boldly proclaimed that it was all a sham - that the investigation was a cover-up, that Albert Speer and his cronies didn't have a care in the world for the value of democracy, nobody except the allies around him listened.

Not that he could determine that anyhow, though.\n\n"REMEMBER THE STRATEGY OF THE ROMANS - DIVIDE AND CONQUER. YOU WILL DO THE SAME HERE." Wessel let the lightest of smiles touch his lips.

Though there was something strange about the way they got all that info, and how suddenly it was, as well as how detailed it is.\n\nGiven the information, however, they had to check it out - and so the Antifa members came down to the street where the students were marching that day, and while one side met the other with warmth, it wasn't initially reciprocated. One of the Antifa members decided to pull ahead of their group and begin shouting. "Klaus Becker!" He shouted, and one of the students raised their hand, moving forward. "We're told your father is a veteran pilot in the Luftwaffe, and that you vote for the NSDAP. Are both of these things true?"\n\nThe silence was unpleasant. It was broken, however, when Klaus let out a laugh. "Who told you THAT?! My Opa is a retired electrician, and I've never touched a ballot in my life! Goodness... if you don't believe me, I'll be happy to show you my father's certificate!" That chipped off some of Antifa's initial weariness, and as more students were asked, more of these nonsensical facts were debunked. By the end of it, both sides joined each other in another, new protest, as Antifa's initial suspicions about that letter were confirmed."

While that would've been all, that day they were also tipped in about something else - by an agent from the RND, no less, about how a group of students would gather in one of these empty classrooms and manufacture their lies and fan the flames of what was going on.\n\nWhen Stefan listened in to a door on a classroom on the second floor, he could hear voices inside. With a smirk, he motioned for his fellow officers to draw their batons as he walked in first, casually opening the door to see six hooligans all gathered around a table, and their attention was turned to him and his gang almost immediately. One of them, a woman, spoke up. "Who are you?" She asked, already becoming worried. Stefan grinned. "Who do you think?" He countered. "We're the police, and we've been informed that you plot an anti-government conspiracy here."\n\nThe mood of the room darkened, and one of the other students spoke up suddenly. "Anti-government conspiracy?! We're just a bunch of students talking! That-", "Silence!" Stefan shouted, expression growing more stern. "I won't tolerate this foolishness. You're all coming with us down to the station where we can determine your loyalty." He slid his free hand against the front of the baton. "Or would you like me to show you what it means to enforce the law?"\n\nA painful silence dominated the space between the two for a few seconds, before one of the students eventually conceded, stepping out and looking frightened. "O-okay." She began. "I-I'll go. Guys?" She asked, looking back to the other who were growing steadily more concerned. "It's n-n-not like we're getting another choice."

With each gatherer celebrating came another member of the German state supporting the NSDAP, meaning everything had been going according to schedule. Even as the liberalized students gathered, protesting the might of the German Reich, the situation was generally handled, as the RND had been able to take control and limit interruptions, even with tensions rising. Nevertheless, the people, although fearing the liberals lurking within the shadows, expressed genuine support for Germany, controllingly, with reverence, with genuine care and concern. \n\nHowever, the gathering of counter-protesting students continued to grow, each crying out over their cares, their damned desire to tear apart the slave system or "stop the German war machine." As the kettle of tension boiled, all it took was three squeezes of a finger to turn the situation into a disaster, as a certain Josef Bachmann, what would be another teenager joining students, shot one of the student leaders identified by the RND, Rudi Dutschke. The first bullet entered between the shoulder and throat, pushing Dutschke back before the second bullet struck, travelling along the side of Dutscke's skull and brain before the final shot tore straight into Dutscke's head, sending a splattering of blood and brain matter across the students as he fell, dead. \n\nWith a section of the guards attacking Bachmann, and Dutscke dead in the arms of his student comrades, chaos reigned. The students broke through the barriers, smashing straight into the rally as several dozen more guards rushed to the scene. Students began to beat guards over the head with clubs, bottles, and bricks, whilst guards responded with gunfire, gas, and armored vehicles. The rest of the events of the rally were canceled as the massive riot of the students endangered the image of the presentations, along with all those supporting the NSDAP present at the rally. \n\nThe city of Nuremberg was placed under lockdown and martial law following the events, searching for the rioters as the German military scoured the city, strictly enforcing rules of curfew and containment. Meanwhile, the Reichsbanner held the gall to support the protests, declaring Bachmann's actions as having been "an orchestrated attack on the leadership of the free speech movement in Germany."

Finally, after catching a few breaths Wessel walked in, greeted by the watchful eyes of around a dozen of Wessel's subordinates, leaders within the intelligence organization, and commanders of several agents of the RND. Some of these men had been there at Nuremberg, some of them their agents. But to Wessel, one thing remained as he walked up to the podium. \n\nNone were innocent from what happened. \n\n"It is not of my nature to scorn my men, nor render any of you all as lowly or failures. However, in addressing the events of the rally for the Reichsparteitag der Macht at Nuremberg, we must recognize a certain degree of failure amidst ourselves and our department in the handling of what happened, and our preparations for a potential conflict. Now, it is our duty to ensure that we can resolve what happened, and where to go from here." Wessel said, as his men looked around, uncomfortable. For the next hour, Wessel scorned them, ensuring each and every one that they would be responsible in the investigation of the incident, now that the world is watching them. \n\n"Herr Gehlen, I'm hoping this is a sufficient hour for you, sir." Wessel said, entering the smoke-filled office of Reinhard Gehlen. "Of course, what is it, Wessel?" Gehlen asked. "Well, sir, it's in regards to the Nuremberg incident. Bachmann's still in custody, and, quite frankly, we need to find out why he shot Dutschke, what if someone's backing him?" Wessel said. Gehlen took a long drag of his cigar, looking at his desk, before uttering with a puff of smoke, "What makes you think anyone else is involved? Could be some fucked up kid after all." "It just doesn't make sense, he's a young kid, small criminal record, doing day jobs, why on Earth would he shoot a political ideologue?" Wessel responded. With a chuckle, Gehlen said, "Huh, well, if you ask me, some of those lowlifes can get all wrapped up in the SS's business, when there's nowhere to gun, men run to the occult. I'd start your search there." Wessel was taken aback, the Ordenstaat? Would they really bother shooting a student leader, just for disagreeing? While doubt rushed to his head about Gehlen's statement, he was interrupted by a young intelligence officer slamming open the door, with an urgent look in his eyes. \n\nJosef Bachmann was found hanged in his cell. A crudely drawn mark of the Schutzstaffel was marked on one of his coat's sleeves, with Gehlen all the more exuberant over his claim of Burgundian guilt."

The customary Schutzstaffel "lightning bolts," Gehlen's quick assumption of the influence of the Ordenstaat, the lack of proper investigation. Wessel, a skilled and experienced investigator, knew that the answers lied within the body, within Bachmann. And yet, everytime he approached the idea, bureaucratic shifts of resources and reorganizations of priorities for the department swept up any attempts. \n\nThe ever-recurring wall of smoke hit Wessel like a wave, only to calm back down and reveal the face of his ever-diligent superior. "Good evening, Herr Gehlen." Wessel greeted. "The same to you, Wessel. Now, a late hour in the night, coming into my office, what's pricked your mind tonight?" Gehlen responded. "Well, Herr Gehlen, I just have some, well, issues in the Nuremberg investigation, but I believe I have a solution. You see, I understand your hypothesis; however, it appears too convenient, or even that we may have overlooked pieces attached to Bachmann that could lead further in any direction. Nevertheless, I believe a formal reinvestigation of Bachmann's body could allow for some, well, advances. Unfortunately, the proposal has been shut down due to other matters of the office becoming, well, randomly prioritized, and I believe we need to focus the investigation." Gehlen said, squashing the cigar against the ashtray on his desk. "Bachmann had clear ties to Burgundian authorities, it's as clear as day upon the man's very clothes. You wish to tell me that it could somehow be something completely different? We have many things to worry about in the RND, reopening a closed case is not one of them, Wessel." Gehlen said, frustratingly, as he lit another cigar. \n\nFury bore into Wessel's body. How could his superior, the man he's respected for so long, suddenly act so obstinately to his pleas? This wasn't right, not at all. Lifting his office phone, Wessel said, "Wedekind...Kessler...to my office, please." \n\nThus, a plan was hatched. A plan for the agents to break into the morgue, to investigate Bachmann's corpse, pictures and all, and bring it all back to Wessel. Wessel could not allow whatever was plaguing the RND to simply scurry away."

With all the lights in the office shut off, and all window shutters brought down against the night sky, the meeting began. \n\n"Wedekind, Kessler. I respect your commitment to the cause we have put together; however, I wish you two to know the legal ramifications of all this. This could easily be what leads us to an early death in a Germanian heavy containment facility. I will be more than happy to allow you to leave and never speak of your involvement again. Do either of you wish to do this?" With the men's eerie silence, and constant stares at Wessel, an understanding agreement was made, and the bag was unzipped to reveal the products of the break-in. Photos, documents, and physical evidence all spilled onto the table. \n\nEach of the photos revealed the harsh, red marks upon the throat, with finger marks all up and down the assassin's throat, with rough scratches and blood trickling down the corpse. Meanwhile, the autopsy report provided even more suspicion regarding the case of death for Josef Bachmann. The primary medical examiner involved in the autopsy of Bachmann had been Dr. Heinz Felfe, who had grown closer and closer to Reinhard Gehlen during his career in the RND, which brought things closer to Gehlen, of course. However, the most damning piece of information dawned in the mind of Gerhard Wessel: Heinz Felfe had been in Kyiv for a criminal autopsy. \n\n"Someone forged these documents." Wessel said, in shock. The two men nodded, Kessler burning through a cigarette in the meantime. "Someone is throwing off this entire investigation. Someone powerful." The questioned remained however: should he intend to pursue whoever is throwing everything off, or would it just lead to their deaths?"

And yet, the documents kept showing more and more proof for Wessel. \n\nAs he stared at the documents, rushes and waves of doubt filled Wessel's mind, as the typically astute, focused, and efficient man turned inwards to paranoia and fear. The man who fought so diligently beside him, as a father, Reinhard Gehlen, and yet his name was plastered all over the investigation, whilst his words covered falsified information and throw offs from the main investigation. Was it true Gehlen? No, it couldn't be, this man was loyal to the Reich, why would he throw things off for a genuinely efficient information bureau that had trusted him dearly? Wessel's minds wandered throughout the worries and doubts of the world, as his entire career up to this point became jeopardized with the notions working in the midst of treachery, while other times it proceeded to become laser-focused on the difficult matter in front of him, looking for any potential leads and openings into this dreadful case of treachery and dangers around every corner. Suddenly, the familiar smoky odor alerted Wessel as he put away the material into his desk and Reinhard Gehlen came in. \n\n"Good afternoon, Wessel. Here, you got some departmental mail regarding last month's procedures and some ways we're looking to improve, figure you may have some worthwhile input, after all." Gehlen said, flashing a smile at his subordinate before leaving. Wessel's tired, sunken eyes could hardly stand any more bureaucracy, when his hands ran along the curious material of the rubber stamp attached to the envelope. That's when an idea hatched in Wessel's mind, and he cleared through his desk to gather the documents, and each of their attached envelopes. Each had a similar rubber stamp, in fact, on closer inspection and magnification, Wessel realized they were all the same: the stamp of Horst Wendland, Vice President of the RND."

They were not the focus.\n\nThis was where Horst Wendland made his base of operations for the day, and Wessel received quite the good news about the state of it. At some point in the afternoon, Wendland was scheduled to have dinner with one Hermann Ludke, an admiral in the Kriegsmarine. Why an admiral and the vice president of the RND met up was unknown to him, but he had his musings on the matter. Still, he wasn't here to spy on them. In fact, quite the opposite.\n\nIn Germany's decadence, many officials slacked on caring about having paranoia-levels of security wherever they went. Wessel had fully expected Wendland to be just like his superior, but clearly he was mistaken. And thankfully so, otherwise this would've been a fruitless endeavour. A report was leaked to Wessel and his team, brief and to the point.

With short radio telecommunications at hand, the agent was slowly guided to the room Wendland had made himself comfortable in, and, after dodging another guard and spending about ten seconds picking the lock to his room, he was in.\n\nThe agent quickly found out that something was off. A large, black object was hidden in the corner of the room, draped in clothing and backed behind a chair, but anything above a passive glance could tell that it didn't belong there. Remembering how the clothes were originally placed, the agent took them off and uncovered... a safe. After relaying this information, some surprise was felt from Wessel's side, but it quickly faded away as he considered his options. There were two, each with their pros and cons.\n\nThe first was to simply bug the system. Wendland was not a very competent nor careful person in Wessel's eyes, so he highly doubted that he would spot that his safe was bugged. It would give easy access to whatever was heard inside his room, though the contents of the safe itself would not be directly uncovered to him.\n\nThe second was to blow the damn thing open and run like hell.

It took them ten whole minutes of searching before they found something.

And occasionally, another voice joined in.\n\nGehlen's- and the contents of these discussions were all about Büro Wessel and its activities. Something beyond Wendland's reach.

Even for a man as bizarre as his superior, he didn't consider him to be that incompetent - and so the worry in his mind refused to go away as he and his agents abandoned the warehouse and wiped any trace of their presence clean."

By that night, they were laid out in front of a table, Wessel himself looking over what was stolen from Wendland. He only wished that blowing their cover - literally, in fact - would have been worth it.\n\nPapers and files, cases and documents. All things Wessel handled gently, but all things that served no purpose to him in the end. They were all about other things not related to the Büro Wessel, or Antifa, or the student protests. Frustration that was present in his mind only grew throughout the night, until after about half an hour of searching, there was nothing.\n\nExcept the one thing yet to be researched. There was an undeveloped roll of film, waiting to be explored. With only one avenue left, Wessel pursued it with intent to find out if this whole operation wasn't just a waste of time."

After all, it was only the results that mattered.\n\nAnd the results eventually came. In his office, he was handed the developed film by an agent of his who hadn't looked at it, and then promptly left the office, leaving the man by himself. From the top, he uncovered his thumb to look at the first picture of the set, and...\n\nWessel felt his heart drop. On the first picture - the very first - there was an image, clear as day, of something being pictured against a wooden table. On a closer glance, he could make out the markings and the design. This was no ordinary document. This was a document that belonged to the Büro Wessel. Then another picture - this time it was open, revealing its incredibly damaging contents inside. While his face was stoic, his mind was in a whirl. Drawn in by the shock, he looked at another image, then another, then another.\n\nBy the end, it had been a long time since Wessel felt such anger brewing in him. But it was driven with a purpose."

When he eventually spoke, Wendland nearly jumped out of his skin. "Don't waste my time, Horst." Wessel almost snarled. "I want you to answer a few simple questions for me." Wendland backed away, his face already paling. "N-no, wait, what do y-you mean by 'simple questions'?" He asked back, and Wessel merely stared at him further.\n\n"What reason did you have for taking pictures of top-secret documents belonging to the Büro Wessel?" His was a voice of stone, betraying nothing, but those familiar with it could make out the invisible intricacies. The purest sense of anger. Wendland only managed to stutter a few meaningless words before Wessel cut him off sharply. "Full sentences. Scattered words do not answer my question."\n\n"I... I c-can't tell you! If I-- if I did, I'd-I-I wouldn't-" Wessel loudly sighed. "Next question." His eyes narrowed even further. "How did you manage to take these pictures? You are--were, under the direct oversight of Reinhard Gehlen." Something was implicated in his words, and Wendland's eyes widened. "No... no, don't ask me that! Don't ask me that!" He yelled, and Wessel's posture refused to change as he spoke. "Who were your associates, Wendland? If you can't answer that, I'll have to pass you on to my other agents."\n\nHe backed up behind a wall, and kept his hands tight on the uncomfortable bed below him. Tremors ran down his limbs, and he couldn't help to stop the incessant shaking of his head, telling him to look away. "God, no, please, I can't-I don't..." He trailed off, and Wessel raised an eyebrow. Would he finally speak? He was almost about to feel some relief when Wendland suddenly shut his eyes tight and made a strange noise akin to a grunt and a gasp, as his head rolled back. When Wessel saw that, his stance broke, and he muttered the slightest 'no' before shouting an order for his agents to come over."

He was killed in a firefight with another group - mercenaries of some sort." \n\nReinhard took a drag of his cigarette. The corners of his mouth tightened ever so slightly. "And you thought it necessary to attempt to contact him, to risk his mission, a mission your Büro had no part in? For all you know, you led these men right to him." \n\n"No. This was a coordinated, pre-planned attack. I was lucky to even see him alive." Wessel noticed the smallest twitch as Gehlen responded. \n\n"You spoke with him?"\n\nCurious. "No. But I overheard enough. He was a double agent. He had been feeding them information ever since he joined. Why?" \n\nReinhard leant over the desk and ground his cigarette into the crystal ashtray. "You seem to forget who is debriefing whom, Herr Kätzchen." Gerhard internally grimaced at the all-too forced codename. "I do not like what you imply. Felfe was a traitor, and his treachery caught up with him." He looked pointedly at Wessel. "You are not privy to the details of every operation this organisation performs. I suggest you get used to that fact." \n\n"Verflitzes Kätzchen" glowered, though his face remained a mask of patience. As he wished.

"These," he continued, pointing fingers at the pictures in front of Gehlen. They were... damaging, to say the least. Proof that Wendland had taken pictures of top secret info that only Wessel's agency would have access to. "What are these, sir? How did the vice-president of the RND get these images? Not only that, he committed suicide via a cyanide pill when questioned about it."\n\nGehlen, after a long period of silence that only served to further annoy Wessel, sighed. "Agent Verflitzes Kätzchen..." He began, pushing the pictures towards him slightly. "These questions shouldn't concern you. They should concern me." He said, voice tightening slightly. "I know the trigger for his suicide. When you asked him about who these pictures were for, correct?" At that, Wessel's breathing became just a bit heavier. "Are you looking for something, Agent... ? A sort of... conspiracy, perhaps?"\n\n"Sir." Wessel returned, staring with an attempt to scan Gehlen's emotions. They were not pleasant. "I am not making any claims. I just want to find out why Wendland took these pictures, and why he committed suicide. If I can get the help of the RND..." Gehlen shook his head. "No, no, no. Agent, you misunderstand. I never requested that such a thing like this be in your portfolio when I gave you your own agency." Gehlen's frown turned into a light smile, and Wessel felt like he wanted to grab on to something. "This is not your problem to deal with. It is mine. I suggest... downscaling your ideas of what you should do and realizing what you should not do." He could see the emotions begin to rise in Wessel's eyes, and that was his call. "Leave it to me, Agent.""

The bracing wind forced him to pull his coat closer to himself, and he quickly entered the black Mercedes awaiting him. "Pleasant trip, sir?" The agent sat opposite him proffered him a file, and gave a tap on the glass between them and the driver. The car pulled away with a purr. \n\n"As good as it could be in this weather." Gerhard opened the file. He had read it before but he preferred to commit information to memory. Paper was unreliable. "Where is Felfe located. The sooner we find out what he knows about the autopsy, the better. " \n\nThe agent looked down sheepishly. "I'm afraid we've been unable to locate him, sir. As soon as I arrived I swept his known hangouts, but by all accounts he hasn't been seen in over a week. We searched his home top to bottom, but no luck." \n\nWessel gave an almost imperceptible frown. The agent's head lowered further. He had expected complications, naturally - complications were nine tenths of his work. Without Felfe, however, this lead was a dead end. Felfe was apparently only person left to have seen the autopsy report,  and the fact he hadn't already revealed it indicated he was saving it for someone else.\n\nThe car slowly pulled its way through the streets of Kyiv. It was a difficult task - the roads were potholed and clogged with a mixture of ancient Soviet vehicles belching smoke and imported German cars, seeming all the more grimy for their spots of gloss black. The signposts were a confusing mixture of German and Ukrainian - both in Cyrillic and the bastardised Latin script that had developed from the confluence of cultures.

His agents had redoubled their search of the city - not just for Felfe but for any subversive that might harbour him or hurt him. He had done some searching of his own, wandering the city. It was remarkable what you could learn just from walking the streets, visiting the bars, finding the feel of people. \n\nNaturally, the Ukrainians and Russians remained churlish against the Reich, with many a drunken curse raised against the Germans. While his agents had indeed determined the presence of local resistance movements, both left and right, they were not his concern. No, it was what he had found in an alley behind a decaying beer hall that disturbed him. \n\n"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit". Not words he had expected to hear in this place, the severed half of their national anthem. Well, one of them, he smirked. He tossed the pamphlet back to his desk, the black, red, gold seeming to glow in the light.  Reichsbanner had beaten him here - a deeply disturbing prospect. He had expected locals, but for German insurgent movements to have travelled this far East? \n\nThis all but confirmed it - Felfe's previous mission regarding the Ukrainians was only a secondary concern to him. Felfe no doubt knew Reichsbanner had been here, but had never reported it. He had been compromised.  A skilled infiltrator, Felfe would have attempted to worm his way into the local resistance. Gerhard knew not where to find Reichsbanner, but his Büro had leads on the Ukrainians. He would find the man, by hook or by crook."

 speer_rnd.61.d:0 "The Ukrainian Herald was a fascinating magazine, in that it seemed to have no author - an impossible feat for such a well read and subversive piece of literature.  No claim that outrageous holds up to close inspection however,  and a few smashed printing presses later revealed that the author, one Viacheslav Chornovil, occupied the deep forests outside Kyiv along with his band of outlaws. Chornovil was viewed as something of a Robin Hood figure by the locals, and had been a great disturbance in the region to Wessel's colleagues. Thus the Büro began its search, finding a remarkable lack of dissidents and a surfeit of trees. It was not until one agent quite literally fell into the answer, that they located a tunnel. \n\nOne geologist and several aerial surveys later, they determined the locations of the other entrances. Thus, Gerhard waited, lying under a pile of branches and camouflage netting. Two other entrances were monitored by his two best agents, and they had made note of the incomings and outgoings of the sizeable tunnel complex - more than two dozen separate people were noted. Wessel made a mental note to order any similar networks rooted out immediately. Through his binoculars, Wessel noticed motion. Glancing at the blurry photo captured yesterday, he recognised the moustachioed face of Viacheslav Chornovil clambering from a cramped tunnel, before sitting on a rock and lighting a cigarette. Gerhard exhaled sharply as he recognised the second rising figure as Heinz Felfe. \n\nGerhard cursed himself for the distance at which he had placed himself - overly cautious, he could not hear their words. However, a shared cigarette and a firm handshake could only imply a deal was being made. He was about to shift closer, when the crack of gunfire ripped through the morning silence."

Felfe lay at the edge of the clearing, blood already caking his shirt. \n\n"We were expecting you, Wessel." \n\nDespite his best efforts, Gerhard started at the use of his name. Chornovil rose, and gestured to his men to let Wessel stand. \n\n"Felfe told us many things. He knew you would come after him eventually. You spend too much time chasing corpses, Mister Wessel." Chornovil smirked - despite Wessel's trained expression, he knew he had struck a nerve. This was undoubtedly not what Gerhard had predicted. Felfe had revealed infinitely more than he expected, and certainly not out of incompetence. "I will admit, I did not expect this attack. I presume it was not your doing, yes?" \n\nGerhard scowled. It would be smart to remain alive - and it would be smarter still to understand why he was allowed to remain alive. "Yes." \n\nChernovil stood eye to eye with Gerhard.

He is half the reason we are still alive. Almost a pity." \n\nGerhard paled. "Spartakus is a myth", he argued, but he didn't quite believe it.

 speer_rnd.66.d:0 "Maintaining the flow of information was Wessel's job. No decision should be made without the most complete knowledge of the situation possible, and it was the Reichsnachtdienst that kept these channels of information open - or so he had thought. It seemed Reinhard had fallen into that old spymaster's trap, the hoarding of knowledge for his own sake. It was therefore up to Wessel to restart the flow. \n\nTo the untrained eye, the headquarters of the Reich's foremost intelligence agency was just another office building. Cleaners have a unique ability to go unnoticed in a crowded room. All too easy for a loose sheet of paper or a cassette to fall into the bag while its owner was preoccupied. A microphone concealed within a lampshade might be noticed in an office, but nobody would even consider searching for one behind the bowl of a toilet, and conversations become less formal when one has their fly undone. \n\nGerhard now enjoyed the fruits of his labours in his office. The unmarked cassette was playing into a pair of headphones. The fact that this tape existed at all was damning enough, but the contents disturbed him greatly. The recording was of a phone conversation - at one end Gehlen's crackling voice; the other, the unmistakable tone of their Führer Albert Speer. He listened to it to its completion, then removed the film from the tape, concealing it within an empty bottle of pills. Gehlen was a true rogue agent, at the head of one of the world's largest intelligence agencies. Reinhard was smart, and revealed much while demanding nothing - nonetheless, Gerhard could recognise the hint of extortion. \n\nTruly, nobody was without sin - Gerhard had known many of the darker secrets of the Reich, but could only hypothesise whether Speer had been party to them. If Gehlen revealed any of what he had found, the Reich would collapse in on itself. Speer had buried his past deep yet Gehlen found it nonetheless. A stark warning of what he was facing. If he was to act against Reinhard Gehlen he must act fast - for the safety of the Reich that his mentor had so clearly forgotten."

He marched through the office floor of the Büro Wessel, giving dismissive nods to those who met his gaze. \n\n"Excuse me, Herr Kätzchen? I have a message for you." \n\nGerhard turned to see a man in dark sunglasses. The man extended his right hand with a slip of paper, clearly expecting him to take it. His left was lazily resting in his coat pocket.  Wessel reached into his pocket as though reaching for a pen; his eyes darted from side to side, establishing the visitor was alone. The man's eyebrows furrowed, and the corner of his mouth turned as he realised his bluff had been called. \n\nWessel pulled his penknife from his pocket all too slowly, as the man's left hand emerged from his coat holding a slim pistol. In one smooth motion the man's arms straightened, the oversized suppressor brushing against Wessel's ear as he jerked to the side. Its detonation nonetheless deafened him and threw off his balance, and he fell into the assassin in a tangle of limbs. A blind thrust of the blade made contact and he stabbed, the knife finally connecting with the man's throat. \n\nWith a gurgle the man in sunglasses expired. Wessel arose, clutching at the side of his head. The bullet had grazed his skull, and from what he could tell taken most of his left ear with it.  The shot had roused the rest of the Büro, and Wessel had to slam down the telephone of a wide eyed secretary who was in the process of calling the Orpo. Whatever number was dialled next, Wessel could guarantee it would not be the one that picked up. \n\nHe barked out swift orders to leave. His Büro had planned for a situation similar to this, though he had never thought they would ever be implemented. His staff would scatter, and the Büro would go dark. He, however, had a meeting to attend. If Speer was compromised, he had to find the next best thing. Exiting through his own secret door, hidden in a den of electrical wires and transformers, he turned up his collar, put on his hat and made for the Reichskanzlei."

He attempted to piece together the recent events in his head, whilst he had a moment of peace. \n\nDutschke's murder had been the flashpoint, and Gerhard was now all but certain Gehlen had ordered it. Further still, Bachmann had been eliminated to throw Wessel off the trail. Gehlen's Büro had been hoarding secrets, making hidden contacts, selling information that was not theirs to sell. They had actively been working against Wessel's own agents from the beginning. To what end? And most damning of all, Gehlen was extorting the Führer himself - one last insurance policy in case the depth of his double-dealing came to light. \n\nHow had this happened? Reinhard Gehlen was an intelligent man, one Wessel had looked up to. Now, Gehlen had sunk to sending hitmen after him in broad daylight. He was sloppy, out of touch, and most of all he could not be trusted. Trust was everything in their business - who to trust and distrust decided who was alive and who was dead.  He turned to look out of the window, and glimpsed a dull red glow. \n\nHe shook off the protesting doctor, and went to the window. In the distance were the party rally grounds, the great theatre in which the NSDAP had performed their ecstatic rallies ever since Hitler took power.

Of course, this message went unheeded by the slaves themselves. \n\nKZ Monowitz, a work camp producing synthetic rubber for IG Farben, had suffered in productivity this last month. The predominantly Polish workers had attempted a campaign of passive protest, gathering in their hundreds and refusing to work until their demands were met. These demands had included increased rations, shorter working hours and the right to contact their families outside in what was once Poland. \n\nUnfortunately, these demands had not reached the capital by the time the protests had been dealt with.

While all were reluctant to send in the army, it had been accepted to use off duty servicemen and party members in old police gear. Still, the line seemed all too thin. \n\nHis investigations had been slow. These protests were organized - radio frequency scans had revealed encrypted transmissions of a type that none of his cryptographers had been able to break yet. That the code would be broken was inevitable, for his Büro had unofficial access to the largest supercomputers in the Reich - the question was, would that be soon enough? If Reichsbanner were responsible they were proving smart enough that more than likely they would have shifted to new frequencies and new codes by the time they RND had broken the encryption. \n\nHe allowed himself a cigarette - a rare luxury. Addiction was a weakness, but it had been long enough that he didn't care. Whoever was behind this had funding and brainpower, enough to stay that one step ahead.

Kurass's official report states that he acted in self defence when Muller attacked him with an improvised weapon. Muller's friends, when later questioned, would state that Muller was dragged into an alley by Kurass and his comrades. The post-mortem examination confirmed that Muller was shot in the back of the head. The results had not been published, and the internal investigation had soon been called off. Kurass would be remanded internally, for to bring charges against a police officer at this time would be dangerous.  \n\nWessel cursed the thugs they hired to the Orpo, cursed the whole sorry affair. He did not have to view the protests from his window anymore - he could hear them. The past day had been a constant roar, such that he and most of his staff had remained at home, relying on information passed between the Büro and their own secure phone lines.

No more aliases or stupid disguises, no more double dealings or treason. Once I am done with the Reichsnachtdienst, it will be extremely hard to tell you ever existed at all." \n\nReinhard gave a sad smile. "As it should be, I suppose. Many of my decisions were mistakes, I know, though I'm sure you'll disagree which ones. But the one thing I am sure was not a mistake, was you." \n\n This time it was Wessel's turn to be taken aback.

He'd heard of information gathering operations in Germany, and rumours of operations in the USA and Japan - today he'd been informed their networks extended across the former Triumvirate, the Reichskomissariats, China and Indonesia, virtually every theatre of conflict on the globe. RND operatives had been unable to uncover little of their operations other than their presence, and the fact that wherever Burgundian agents went, chaos and destruction soon followed. He'd heard unsubstantiated reports that they were behind virtually every political assassination in every country in the past twenty years, and partisan movements across the globe had been noted to carry arms bearing arms traced to the Silent State.  \n\nThe motives for these operations were still unknown, with a single shred of concrete information from stolen SS documents in Italy sent before their mole went dark - the operations all contributed towards Himmler's Globalplan.

speermilitary.2.desc:0 "To the people who had been looking at the victory parade after the end of the last war, it must have seemed ludicrous to even think that the German military supremacy over the entire world could ever falter, even in a thousand year: sadly, as most things human, all it took was a couple decades. Without the threat of a powerful enemy, corruption and infighting began tearing the Wehrmacht apart in what historians would probably call "a twisted parody of the Late Roman Empire"\n\nLike the Roman generals they were so fond of, the highest German officers bought the loyalty of their men by promising hefty bonuses at the end of their service, siphoning the needed funds from the Reich's budget with the subtle threat of open revolt should anyone refuse them. As a result, the Wehrmacht bloated horrendously, eating more and more of the public expenses and contributing to the final collapse of the German economy. The increase in dimensions, however, didn't result in a better military: on the contrary, overloaded logistics, unfit recruits, outdated equipment and infighting between officers turned what was once a jewel of efficiency into a wheezing sick patient, as the Second Russian War showed perfectly.\n\nNow, with the civil war over, Von Tresckow has planned a large reform of the German armed forces to return them to their former glory. The program will concern all of the Wehrmacht, from the Heer, to the Luftwaffe, to the Kriegsmarine: everything will be turned upside down, until it fits his ideals once again. However, this won't be an easy task: many officers of the old guard are still in active service and will try to resist the reform at all costs, especially if they are supported by the conservative elements of the NSDAP. It seems this battle will be far more political than expected..."

The German air force was the personal playground of Herrman Göring, the main responsible for the current decadence of the Reich, and a large number of officers owe their rank to him: despite his defeat, his political clout is still present, and it will take time and effort to remove it before any real reform can be passed without mass desertions or worse.\n\nGöring's influence, however, wasn't limited to the officers, but it covered even the doctrinal aspects of air combat. As of now, our air fleet is heavily unbalanced towards long-range bombers - the result of a decade-long bombing campaign over Russia and Western Africa - and even worse, due to the gargantuan costs of running such a meaningless operation, there weren't enough funds to develop new airframes to keep up with the new discoveries.\n\nAs a result of this, the Luftwaffe is extremely outdated in both doctrines and equipment, despite its large numbers, and will most likely perform with abysmal results against any modern air force of the world."

This exponential growth, however, overloaded the supply system until it finally broke, and only served to enrich the weapons industry in cahoots with the military leadership.\n\nWith the constant downturn of the German economy, more and more money was diverted towards maintaining this living corpse - the mere thought of cutting military spending was met with subtle threats of civil war - with the result that any kind of research or improvement was halted due to lack of funds. Poorly-trained soldiers, outdated panzers, malfunctioning aircraft and old doctrines were the reasons for the collapse of the German defenses during the West Russian War, but not even this was enough to let the corrupt High Command understand the depth of their mistakes, and the Heer continued its decadence.\n\nWith the civil war over, the Heer has been left reeling from its losses and from the difficulty of serving once more alongside those who mere months before were manning a machine gun aimed at you. This, however, is also the perfect time for reform: Von Treskow has a clear idea of what he wants the German army to become, and he won't stop until it has become reality. This, however, might be difficult, as several prominent generals and field marshalls, chief among them Ferdinand Schrörner, will try to stop him at any cost."

With the Reich focusing its doctrine on trade interdiction as the war became longer than expected, large and expensive capital ships such as the Bismarck were kept anchored, and the seas became the hunting ground for rabid packs of nimble, mass-produced U-Boots: the British and American economies were crippled, paving the way for the Axis to win in the long run, and for Admiral Dönitz to cement his position as the navy's helm.\n\nDuring the following years of relative peace, the Kriegsmarine was mostly left to rot, and most of the navy funds were slowly siphoned towards the Heer. The West Russian War saw spelled even more cuts for the navy as the generals took more and more funds for their pet projects and to feed the bloated monster that was now the army.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out, the Kriegsmarine sided with Bormann, but Dönitz decided to retreat to Crimea, realizing that no matter his allegiance, there was no way the navy could do anything except getting either sunk or scuttled.\n\nDespite surviving the war almost untouched, however, the Kriegsmarine is in a dire state. Years of neglect have left the navy small and obsolete, with most ships dating back to the last war: as things are, a total overhaul is needed in both doctrine and equipment, to bring it back from the dead and turn it into a modern fleet. Despite the resistances of admirals formerly close to Dönitz, von Tresckow knows a new and powerful Kriegsmarine is necessary if Germany is to return at the forefront of military innovation."

On one hand, we could go the safe route and focus on infantry weapons: better rifles and grenades will have an impact throughout the entire Heer, no matter the unit or doctrine. Another choice is artillery: gone are the times of giant railway guns, now self-propelled weapons and light, infantry-portable mortars are the way forward, improving mobility and efficiency of the support units. Some wish to improve the support echelons of the Heer with better logistics, modern engineers and advanced medical detachments to fully aid our troops in their task.

When the officers of the Wehrmacht started siding with this or that pretender, swearing their loyalty to their frontrunner, they caused a bloody civil war that caused untold amounts of victims.\n\nNow, some reformist officers wish to fully detach the army from the party, even more than what the new leader desires, and the first step would be to replace the oath of loyalty to the Führer with a more neutral oath to the nation and its institutions. While these officers aren't showing any sign of disloyalty, and will accept any decision on the matter, it's evident that this will have repercussions on the larger political debate: already the reformists within the Reichstag call for a comprehensive reform to remove any political influence in the army, while the conservatives are trying to stop what they call a "dangerous push towards anarchy"\n\nAs the government is called to decide on the matter, what will the Führer do?

Given the predisposition of Berlin and the unnaturally lethal tone of the message, we have been given every reason to believe that they intend to make good on their promise.\n\n Our forces - those that will follow our orders at least - are being made ready, though none hold the delusion that the Reich's warmachine could be bested. Perhaps, however, they will not have to be. Given our geographical position and relative miniscularity, it is unlikely that they would bring to bear the entire Wehrmacht against Madagaskar. As such, if they send a proportionate force it is possible to resist and make a quick invasion turn into a grueling exercise in hubris.\n\n But even so, not even our most optimistic officers expect this assumption to prove true, as the Germans are just as likely to rain ordnance on our heads until we throw down our weapons or die in the process, and it's likely they don't much care which outcome arises first. Ultimately, the ruthless calculus of war has a habit of reducing one's choices.

When their reply was not made ready quickly enough, an incoming fly-over of the island by our bombers served to catalyze a faster response. As of right now reprisals are planned, but we are working to ensure that sufficient control of the islands and the surrounding waters are achieved first so as to avoid any last-minute complications; even as we are past the point of armed resistance, we intend to avoid the possibility of further issues arising.\n\n Though ownership of Madagascar and its islands is important to the dominance of those southern seas, the true fruit of this endeavor is the public image of a once rebellious land willfully submitting to the rightful rule of our administration.

He shuddered at the memory, but even those difficult days were so beautiful, so dangerous, so exciting! Back then, when he had served the Kaiser in Italy and France, airplanes were but wooden caskets with an engine: to think that such things could even fly without exploding! And yet he was witness to their agility and power, and to the bravery and camaraderie of the men piloting them. He remembered the Caproni bomber he desperately tried to take down above Treviso, only for himself to be the one falling to the ground. He remembered flying over Verdun during a night with no moon, the artillery strikes lighting the darkness like a starry sky upside down. He remembered his comrades, his friends, even his enemies, all people who fought with their life to the line, and never surrendered.\n\nA voice awakened Fritz from his small trip into the past, and he realized the sun has long since set. Poor Margarethe, she cooked for him and even had to call him! With a last look to the sky, he got up from his chair, and from the creaks in his bones he could have sworn it was an airplane taking off: his legs were starting to fail him like an old engine. He turned his back to the window and left, but he knew a part of him was still there, staring at the sky."

speermilitary.22.desc:0 "For the entire Wehrmacht, but the Heer more than all others, the Bürgerkrieg was like a scythe wielded by death itself, decimating simple soldiers and officers alike as the fighting degenerated in house-to-house combat, where the entirety of Germany was the frontline, and the command tent was a place like any other to fight and die. The following period wasn't any kinder to the Oberkommando der Heer, as many disloyal, corrupt or incapable officers were systematically purged, leaving a large hole in the officer corps.\n\nHowever, from problems come opportunities, and Von Tresckow knew this very well. The Prussian general spent the years of the reconstruction not only reforming the army doctrines and structural organization, but also training the new generation of officers, to ensure they wouldn't follow in their predecessors' footsteps. One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of the Offizierschule des Heeres in Dresden: staffed by the best remaining military theorists, the new institution was made so that cadets from the entire Reich could learn the new doctrines of war in a suitable environment. Of course, said "environment" would be filled with references to the Prussian discipline and the reformist ideas...\n\nDespite the ideological issues, however, no one can deny that the Offizierschule has done an excellent work. The end of the first training cycle, and the subsequent ceremony in which the young cadets took their rank as full-fledged officers of the Heer, marks a new beginning for the armed forces of the Reich: we can only pray that these new generals and lieutenants will prove worthier than their predecessors, and able to keep the Wehrmacht from descending once more into decadence."

speermilitary.23.desc:0 "Karl Dönitz felt a bit of deja-vu as he entered the Führer's personal office. He had been there many times, but this time, the man seated behind the desk was different. Albert Speer looked at him sternly, Henning Von Tresckow standing at his side, his back rigid and a slightly offended expression on his face. The admiral advanced to the desk and stopped, saluting the Führer as protocol demanded even though his demeanor made it clear he would have wanted someone else on that chair.\n\n"Admiral Dönitz" Speer began, his voice severe, "I have called you here for an important matter regarding your conduct during the civil war"\n\nThe old admiral knew it was coming, so he steeled himself for what was to come. "I'm ready to take my punishment if it is needed" he answered with a calm, resigned voice.\n"During the civil war, it has been proved beyond doubt that you took Bormann's side. Not only that, but you also fled the country during the chaos, taking the majority of the Kriegsmarine with you, disobeying all orders to fight and finding refuge in Crimea"\n"I did that to save the Kriegsmarine!" was the immediate answer, but what came next surprised him.\n"I know that, admiral, and through your action, you saved many ships which would have been lost, or even worse, used against us. For this reason, Von Tresckow and I came to an agreed and fitting solution"\nA barely audible snort told the admiral that the "agreement" was mostly on one side, but he focused his attention back on Speer.\n"For Betraying the Reich and fleeing, you will be stripped of your rank as admiral, and formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty. For saving the majority of the Kriegsmarine from certain destruction or capture, you shall be graced, and your decorations will not be revoked."\n\nThe now-former admiral felt a pang in his heart knowing that his service was over in such a way, but he knew it could have been much worse. He took off his hat and deposited it on the desk, then saluted and left the room without a word."

Chief among them was the traitorous admiral Karl Dönitz, who had fled from Germany with the majority of the Kriegsmarine to find refuge in Crimea. After the end of the war, the admiral surrendered himself when threatened with retaliation from the new government in Germania. His hopes of keeping his rank were shattered a few months later, when he was formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty, and tried together with several SS members and generals who followed either Göring or Bormann.\n\nWhen the day of the verdict came, Dönitz stood with the other defendants in the courtroom. The judges entered the room, one by one, and then read the final sentence: the admiral didn't listen what had been decided for the others, though the amount of screams and cries told him that convictions were far more than acquittals. Finally, it was his turn, and it took all he had not to join the rest of the accused in their screams: "The court declares Karl Dönitz, chief admiral of the Kriegsmarine, culprit of treason and dereliction of duty, and for this he is sentenced to be stripped of all his ranks and decorations, and to thirty years of detention"\n\nAs the guards stripped him of the signs of his rank, he didn't protest, and when they brought him away in handcuffs, he didn't even try to resist. He simply followed, his head low, shame radiating from him like the stench of treason he emanated."

A suitable location - a hill surrounded by a small forest near the coast - had been labelled "enemy fortification" and suitably equipped with bunkers, tents and mock emplacements containing old machine guns and artillery pieces. At the given signal, the combined might of the Wehrmacht was unleashed upon the unfortunate earth mound.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine opened fire upon the enemy positions, neutralizing anti-air batteries and grievously damaging several other emplacements. Immediately after, bombers from the Luftwaffe dropped their deadly cargo upon the trenches, anti-tank cannons and machine guns, clearing the way for the Heer. Tanks rolled towards their target, and infantry both motorized and on foot followed in their wake to occupy the objective. Thanks to the radio coordination, there were no instances of friendly fire, and the entire operation was declared a success.\n\nFor the entire time, Henning Von Tresckow looked with a satisfied expression at the scene unfolding a few hundred meters from his command tent. Several other members of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht - generals, aviators and even a couple Kriegsmarine officers - were present,  all murmuring their approval for how the army reforms were having their desired effect. The Prussian general allowed himself a smug smirk: everything was going as planned."

This situation called for an open hand however - and a letter penned by an articulate one. \n\n The Führer lowered the paper and set his gaze on its author who stood before his desk. Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt had shown eagerness at the prospect of reaching out to the Americans. The letter was good - stately but not too domineering, eloquent but not flowery. The letter was not the question. The Americans may have sent arms back when he was directing mobs of students, but now he was at the helm of the ship, who knew what they would want? "I'm sure I don't need to impress upon you the importance of this summit. You represent " \n\n  "I do. The Americans want things to cool down just as much as we do. They'll have their demands, but I don't think they'll be unreasonable with our country's history of walking out of negotiations." Schmidt gave a bitter smile. \n\n  "Give them what they want, I suppose." Speer glared at the telephone as if anticipating it's angry ring later. "Just be reasonable." \n\n"

"Excellent work, Helmut." The other members of cabinet gave the Foreign Minister a polite round of applause. Stifled coughs interrupted the backslapping, an unavoidable consequence of Schmidt's ashtray filled with cigarettes, along with Erhard's seemingly endless cigar. Speer waved his hand at a secretary who scrambled to open a window.\n\n  "Where do you intend to hold this meeting?" \n\n "I imagine there'll be some back and forth about that. Somewhere neutral would be preferred, if such a place even exists these days. Iceland perhaps, though if we push we could get them to visit Hamburg. It didn't come out of the war too badly" \n\n Albert suppressed the urge to mention the obvious fact that it was also Schmidt's home. He supposed the man could be excused a moment of vanity - capable as Schmidt was, Speer had been uncertain of his ability to achieve this meeting. There had always seemed to be something the man had been holding back, however - some fire in his eyes. Perhaps this was his chance to show it. \n\n "Then I wish you luck with the Americans.

A particularly definitive no, if he was correctly reading between the lines. \n\n He dropped the letter and leaned back into his chair, letting out a heavy sigh.

Speer would have wanted them brought straight to Germania to see his Volkshalle - the Führer thought himself a humble man but how he could stand to see that bulging growth of national arrogance every day, Helmut could not understand. The Americans would not like it, as much as they loved their monuments. Plus, it was fucking freezing in there.\n\n The door opened behind him. The Reichsminister turned and gave a nod before the messenger could speak - the Americans had arrived. Helmut ground his cigarette into the ashtray that rested on the windowsill. It certainly was an amazing view. The lights of the old city, uncorrupted by the colossal yet crumbling architecture that seemed to define their Reich's recent history. He turned to the door as the voices began to carry up the corridor, reached into his jacket, and pulled out another cigarette."

We have refused the Americans' other two major demands, but even this relatively smaller undertaking is causing a humongous uproar among the military high command.

This move will certainly make a restoration of trade much more enticing to the Americans, as it will undoubtedly be a huge boon for their economy and development. As it would be for ours as well. /n/n Hopefully, this economic offer is enough to satisfy them, as we are effectively refusing their other two (political and ethical) offers.

While we have denied the request to grant our substantial slave population a greater degree of rights, these other two concessions will hopefully not be as potentially harmful to our social fabric and popularity. Of course, we are still experiencing a large amount of hostility from our military and from our few diplomats to non-OFN countries. /n/nmHowever, these sacrifices will ultimately be worth the heavy price, as the economic and geopolitical opportunities which would open up to the Reich if the Americans agree would be monumental. Therefore, we are simply awaiting the American response to our most gracious compromise."
SPEERUSA.22.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.23.t:0 "Slave Rights and America First"
SPEERUSA.23.desc:0 "In what is correctly being considered to be a very large concession, we have decided to agree to the American demands to grant limited rights to the millions of slaves working in the Reich, and to give the Americans priority trade access to all of our goods. Due to other geopolitical considerations, we have refused their third demand to reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile. Still, there is likely to be major opposition from the most ideological members of the party and the Reich at large, though we don't have much of a choice. /n/n We chose to make these concessions because the benefits are predicted to outweigh the social costs; we must engage in more trade if we ever want our economy to recover! Let us hope that these policies are enough to persuade the Americans to engage with us, as we would be rather hard pressed to concede anything more. This is for the good of the Reich, and so it must be enough."
SPEERUSA.23.a:0 "A necessary trade-off."

SPEERUSA.24.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.24.desc:0 "In order to appease the Americans, we have agreed to both reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile and grant limited rights to the millions of slaves existing within our borders. While we do expect major backlash from both the military and social conservatives respectively, we are fortunate enough that, in the long term, neither of these changes should cause serious harm to the Reich's social fabric or economy (provided we handle them with the utmost care). /n/n Because of the significant economic gains we would be poised to make in the event the Americans do agree to open up trade with us, such a generous display of good faith will likely outweigh the costs. Additionally, many worrying reports regarding the extent of subversive political groups throughout the Reich suggest that there might even be a subset of our population which is strongly in favour of these reforms. Though that is hardly any consolation, since it is the resistance of people in powerful positions we have to worry about."
SPEERUSA.24.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.25.t:0 "We have Agreed to all Demands."
SPEERUSA.25.desc:0 "We have accepted all the american demands, to reduce our nuclear stockpile, to allow american companies first trade rights in our country, and yes, even allowing more rights for the slaves.

Speer has been working tirelessly to ensure their fears, and to show them that these concessions to the Americans were necessary for the Reich to not only heal, but to grow from what it was before. He has given speeches from Germania to Frankfurt, praising the Reichs diplomats, and the Americans for understanding the need for friendship. Soon, he says, all Germans will have their lives improved with the end of the american embargo.""
SPEERUSA.28.a:0 "We can only hope."

SPEERUSA.29.t:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
SPEERUSA.29.desc:0 "Upon arriving in New York City, Schmidt didn't know how to feel. He'd never seen a city like this before. It was cluttered with countless tall, imposing, and- frankly- ugly buildings that left a unique and indescribable impression which could be felt nowhere else on Earth. What was it? This city was so foreboding and yet so utterly charming. Why couldn't a single German city produce this sort of emotion in its architecture? It made Schmidt want to explore! /n/n Unfortunately, reality got in the way of Schmidt's daydreaming. An entourage of diplomatic staff awaited him, and Schmidt was stuck shaking their hands and exchanging pleasantries for what seemed like an eternity. But, Schmidt reminded himself, restarting relations with the United States was of the utmost importance and would lead to the betterment of living conditions for all of humanity. So of course, Schmidt buttered up every last staffer as much as he could without brown nosing, and even managed to engage in some legitimately friendly and amicable conversations. Hell, he even managed to crack a few well-received jokes. But once all of that babble was said and done came the sightseeing. /n/n Naturally, there was beautiful Central Park, flashy Times Square, the monumental Empire State Building, and of course, Lady Liberty herself (admittedly not as large as expected from a distance but still symbolically powerful). Interestingly, Schmidt at one point passed through a neighbourhood called Greenwich Village, apparently home to people and activities his colleagues considered "degenerate," though Schmidt never understood how people's private business bothered others. All in all, Schmidt had rarely had a more exciting day and was completely enthralled by NYC's alluring atmosphere."
SPEERUSA.29.a:0 "New York, New York: A hell of a town!"

SPEERUSA.30.t:0 "The City of Angels"
SPEERUSA.30.desc:0 "As the Luftwaffe VIP plane began its descent, Schmidt couldn't help experiencing a mixed range of feelings upon viewing Los Angeles's skyline. While it was no doubt impressive, it seemed as if it were a work of progress that had stalled and stunted over a decade ago. The abundance of military installations and vehicles surrounding the city's harbour reminded Schmidt that the Japanese occupation of the US's major West Coast Ports had likely crippled the region's industry and thus the growth of what was once the most impressive city on the entire Pacific Ocean. Of course, it wasn't like the Reich was in much better shape after its own self-imposed economic downturn and the Bürgerkrieg. "More lives being ruined by fascism. What's new?" Schmidt thought to himself. But voicing such opinions aloud would be just as damaging to his mission here as it would be to his career (and no doubt his life) back home. /n/n Much more concerning than the quality of L.A.'s skyline was the quality of Schmidt's reception, consisting of some random, nameless bureaucrats whose names Schmidt begrudgingly decided he would eventually learn anyway for the sake of making a good impression. After enough obligatory handshakes and small talk to drive even the most shallow of aristocrats to madness, Schmidt was finally able to do some sightseeing. There was the lively Santa Monica Pier with an ocean view unrivalled anywhere in the continental Reich, the both elegant and exciting Griffith Observatory, from which Schmidt could see the famous Hollywood sign in need of repair, and the excessive Venice Canals (funnily, now the only Venice Canals thanks to Atlantropa, yet another Nazi failure) and all sorts of other wonderful, if slightly tacky, attractions. /n/n The bounty of interesting sights was partially marred by Schmidt's necessary security detail, but what really bothered Schmidt was the lack of opportunity to gain a real and honest understanding of how the American people lived day to day. How else could he truly understand what sort of provisions the Americans would surely want in the re-establishment of relations? And, unlike his colleagues, perhaps Schmidt actually gave a damn about the lives of non-Aryan human beings. Oh well."
SPEERUSA.30.a:0 "No time to worry about that now. Off we go!"

SPEERUSA.31.t:0 "Schmidt in the White House"
SPEERUSA.31.desc:0 "It was just a brief and simple event, and largely for the sake of the press anyways, but that didn't mean it wasn't overwhelmingly important. Yet, as he entered the stately White House grounds, Schmidt couldn't carry himself solemnly. He deserved to be jovial in front of the US president and the press. This signing was his success, and more importantly, a success for the downtrodden citizens of the Reich and the United States. Why shouldn't he appear to be happy on the outside, since that was exactly how he felt on the inside? /n/n Cracking a gentle smile, Schmidt shook hands with the president amidst the flashing of the journalists' cameras, and together they walked along the North Lawn and up the steps beneath the building's facade. The president approached a podium standing on the porch and gave a rather run-of-the-mill speech regarding the value and necessity of the deal which was about to be officially signed. Then it was Schmidt's turn. /n/n "Don't worry, I'll keep this very short. We are here today because we have finally realized that we should stop shooting ourselves in the foot, and that it is better for us to cooperate. I assure all of you that some of our previous administration's, so to speak, policies which some might have found a little unsavoury are in many instances unlikely to continue in the same fashion as they have for the last several years. I believe that this is a period of drastic change, and just as today is unrecognizable to the world of 25 years ago, the world 25 years from now will be unrecognizable to us today. And so, we absolutely must ensure that our future is one of prosperity and cooperation, and of a higher quality of life for all of our citizens. This treaty is an excellent first step. Thank you very much.""

Though the détente has panned out headspinningly quickly, we of course arranged for Mr. Schmidt to meet with the president for dinner at the White House. /n/n Minister Schmidt was incredibly polite and even jovial, and had little trouble easing any perceived tension between his and our envoys. Apparently a joke of his even cracked a laugh out of the president, which if true would do much to alleviate the pervasive stereotype that all Germans are humourless. /n/n Schmidt and the president stood before the White House's North Lawn and all of the press to officially sign the document ending the embargo between Germany and the US. May God bless the United States of America, and may God bless our new... partners... the German Reich."

SPEERUSA.33.t:0 "The American Delegation Arrives"
SPEERUSA.33.desc:0 ""Mr Dowling, a pleasure. I hope you find our country to your liking." Schmidt shook his hand like it owed him money, and Walter blinked at the bright sunlight that was assaulting him but a moment after he had left the safety of the plane. \n\n"Herr Schmidt, good to finally meet you" he replied, attempting to assert himself. The United States is eager for our parties to come to an agreement for our mutual benefit." \n\n Schmidt smirked behind his face. Off guard and backfooted was how they needed them - diplomats could be so predictable when they fell back on their instructions. Of course he wouldn't have organised this meeting without having planned every moment himself. The issue was too important to be delegated. He gestured to the vast Mercedes-Benz that waited to shepherd them away, shining a glossy black from windows to tyres. \n\n "Of course, of course, but first you must see the sights. Hamburg is a truly beautiful place.""
SPEERUSA.33.a:0 "Hamburg's canals are one of the loveliest sights in Germany."
SPEERUSA.33.b:0 "The city's gardens are unparalleled in natural beauty."

SPEERUSA.34.t:0 "The Canals"
SPEERUSA.34.desc:0 ""In fact, Hamburg has more bridges than any other city in the world!" Schmidt had seemed laid back at their first meeting, but now that they toured his home town the man had lit up. He gestured grandly at yet another stately bridge arcing across the canal. Walter Dowling was the first ambassador to Germany since 1941 - in fact he was the first American to legally set foot on Reich soil in more than twenty years. They walked together, their staff about thirty feet behind. No doubt they were conducting their own diplomacy behind the scenes, while Schmidt and Dowling did their best to ignore the cameras strategically posed above them. \n\n "It sure is a fine place." Walter admitted. It may not have the great skyscrapers of New York, but the place had its own, subtler history. The great city hall overlooking the Alster, the towering cathedral spire, these charming canals - he knew he was being wooed, but damn if Schmidt didn't know how to do it. \n\n They turned a corner, slowing to allow the lackeys to catch up. Schmidt reached into his pocket and pulled out one of those seemingly ever-present cigarettes. He offered one to Walter who shook his head - half the charm of the open city was its clean air, and he already had a splitting headache from the morning spent locked up in that smokehouse of an office with the Reichsminister. Walter turned to examine the brickwork, and came to face something he never thought he would see. He did his best to conceal his strangled gasp as a cough, only half succeeding - Schmidt turned to view the line of bullet holes in the wall, the discarded rubbish that littered it's base, and the bare earth turned to mud that formed a long stain stretching into the canal . The hangers-on rounded the corner as well, and Helmut took a long, long drag. Just when he thought he'd located the perfect route."
SPEERUSA.34.a:0 "There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this..."
SPEERUSA.34.b:0 "This is not what it looks like.."

SPEERUSA.35.t:0 "The Gardens"
SPEERUSA.35.desc:0 "One of the most touching moments of the visit was when the delegation visited the restored Tropengewächshäuser, Hamburg's botanical garden. A painstaking effort had been made to bring them to their former beauty: old photos had been retrieved, and from them a team of experts had acquired the original plants and flowers from their exotic homes, and rebuilt the pavilions and paths scattered across what was once a place of peace and tranquility. Just like that garden - that was the message Reichsminister Schmidt was trying to convey - the entire Reich would slowly become a better place for everyone.\n\nEven though the plants were still very young, and the grass still had to cover all the new flowerbeds, the American delegation was impressed by the effort. That is, until a diplomat stumbled upon a small earth mound while exploring a more secluded part of the garden, dislodging a few stones and revealing what was buried right below.\n\nAt first, Helmut Schmidt was annoyed by the commotion, but as soon as he turned away from his conversation with the ambassador, any trace of mirth disappeared from his face along with its color: barely hidden under a thin layer of earth and stones, was a human arm, its decomposed flesh barely covered by a tattered uniform, dried blood stains still visible on the discolored fabric. The workers were called, and they soon started digging: the first corpse was carefully set on the side of the hole, but immediately under it, another appeared, and another, and another. Despite all the prayers running through Schmidt's mind, they didn't stop.\n\nAs the sun started setting, one hundred and fifty-eight bodies clad in military uniform had been unearthed, and now the entire American delegation was turned towards the pale, heavily-sweating ghost of what was once Helmut Schmidt. The ambassador looked at him sternly, and his words felt steel-cold to the Minister, like an executioner's blade on his victim's neck: "Explain this, Mr. Schmidt. Now." and the answer he received was..."
SPEERUSA.35.a:0 "It's truly sad, Herr Ambassador, but it was our only choice..."
SPEERUSA.35.b:0 "It was the only fitting punishment for criminals such as these!"

SPEERUSA.36.t:0 "A Heated Conversation"
SPEERUSA.36.desc:0 "The American delegation found that they were in for a treat. Speer had himself personally been delivered in the Großer Mercedes to the Hamburg City Hall. Upstanding German citizens had transformed the Emperor's Hall into a magnificent dining room, and the tables were set for a great roast dinner, with plenty of drink on the sides. The Krauts and Americans began with a great conversation on cultural comparisons and personal anecdotes, but stalled for a good half an hour as the head of the delegation and the Führer himself engaged in a fierce argument over the differences between capitalism and national socialism. After some time, the foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, stood up and managed to reconcile the opposing interlocutors. \n\n Even if Herr Speer and the delegation may not see eye-to-eye, Schmidt showed that there is some democratic and liberal spirit thriving underneath the Reich. The reports back home to Washington that night were ample in praise for the regime in Germania. Truly, the Reich is a land of wise men, great artists, and certainly delicious meals."
SPEERUSA.36.a:0 "They have had only a glimpse of the German ideal."

SPEERUSA.37.desc:0 ""My apologies Ambassador - I did not wish you to have to see this.

He kept his voice level. The various secretaries following at their heels pricked their ears. \n\n ""You understand, of course, that discipline must be maintained in war. The men dealt with here were the worst of the worst - men who flocked to the banners of the likes of Göring, Bormann and Heydrich for the chance to loot, rape and pillage. Hamburg had the fortune of maintaining a strong student militia, who were able to put them down before-" \n\n Ambassador Dowling had knelt down to pick something up. He stood and held it up to Schmidt's eyes. A high heeled shoe, stained a muddy red. For the first time in a long time Schmidt stumbled on his words - his mouth curled in an ugly expression before he sighed and flicked his cigarette into the canal. \n\n "There was much collateral damage. While the students may have been some of our Führer's most ardent supporters, they were... overzealous. \n\n Dowling scowled and dropped the shoe. How many innocent people lay at the bottom of that canal?"
SPEERUSA.37.a:0 "My god.."

SPEERUSA.38.t:0 "Schmidt Explains Themselves"
SPEERUSA.38.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt wore a solemn expression as he narrated to the American delegation the story of the final days of the "Battle for Hamburg" which saw reformist militias face the feared "Verlorene Hoffnung" SS-Division, tasked by Reynard Heydrich to take the city at the beginning of the civil war, when everyone was scrambling to establish control over as much territory and industry as possible.\n\nThe division easily broke through the city outskirts, and started executing anyone suspected of being a Speerite, which meant almost everyone as Hamburg was well-known for harboring reform-aligned sentiments. Then, the militias launched a pincer manoeuver near the university, along the Grinderallee, forcing the enemy to retreat under heavy fire: while most managed to leave, a group of around two hundreds SS took refuge in the botanical garden, but in the end they all either died fighting, or committed suicide.\n\n"I beg you, try to imagine how this beautiful city was after the attack" the Reichsminister pleaded as his audience listened, "Ten thousand civilians had been murdered, the hospitals were full of wounded, the university had been turned into an emergency infirmary, and the obituaries were exploding with bodies so much that we had to store them in the market square: hundreds of innocents and loved ones piled like sandbags, waiting for their turn to be buried without a funeral!" Finally, he looked at the lined corpses with tear-filled eyes, and no one could truly understand whether they were the practiced trick of an expert diplomat, or if one of those "sandbags" after the battle had been someone he knew. "We couldn't bury them. There was no place in the cemeteries, not even for our own people. Sad as it may be, they were buried here not out of cruelty, but to avoid the spread of infection."\n\nAfter a minute of silence, the American ambassador hugged the Minister, expressing his sympathy for the population of this wounded land, and asked him if he was still able to continue the negotiations. Visibly relieved, Schmidt nodded, and they left this small piece of a horrible past behind."

Dowling is subtly suggesting the Reich as it is now would never be able to stand the test of time, and though Helmut agrees in his heart, he can't help but think his duty was to defend the Führer's work: Speer may be an asshole sometimes, and block his reforms with stale concepts such as "moderation" and "not risking another civil war" but openly criticizing him? He wouldn't be so undiplomatic do such a thing in front of a foreign delegation!\n\nAs he takes the wine in his hand, he knows he has to make a choice: counter Dowling's subtle accusations, or divert the course of the conversation?"

Convincing Speer that impressing the Americans with enjoyable films was more pragmatic than angering them with propaganda was not very difficult. /n/n And indeed, the reactions Schmidt distinguished indicated that Das deutsche Filmfestival in Hollywood was at least a mild success. By far the most popular work shown was an ambitious remake of the hit 1942 drama Die große Liebe; its message was subtly shifted from one of commitment to war to being anti-war, but what really caused it to stand out was its new star: renowned comedy actor Heinz Rühmann, demonstrating his versatile acting abilities portraying Paul, the romantic lead.

At least they'd be able to get some "practice" that didn't involve mercilessly terror bombing innocent African and Russian civilians. But Schmidt did not care to attend the airshow, as he didn't wish to be reminded of his time at the Ministry of Aviation; after all, didn't he effectively have a hand in those terror bombings? No, he wouldn't think about it. The sooner Schmidt's diplomatic endeavours succeeded, the sooner Germany could be rid of Nazism, which was all that mattered now as far as he was concerned. /n/n From what Schmidt had heard from one of his envoys, the airshow had been another mild success, with the Luftwaffe squadron impressing the Americans with a variety of formations, maneuvers, and one particularly sharp turn that apparently caused a great number of gasps. Well, as long as all of these goodwill gestures were appreciated by the Americans, Schmidt had nothing to worry about. A few more tours, a few more fun events, and everything would turn out fine... hopefully."

SPEERUSA.53.desc:0 "As the relationships between the Reich and the United States of America improve, trade trickles, then flows, and finally flourishes between the two former rivals. The crowning of Reichsminister Schmidt's efforts finally comes in an official communique from the American ambassador in Germania: with a great fair being planned in Boston, not only has the Reich been invited, but an entire pavilion has been reserved for its exclusive use!\n\nImmediately, the news is broadcasted nationwide, and an inter-ministerial committee is immediately appointed to oversee the preparations: with the complexity of such an affair, it's only natural that the ministries for the economic, diplomatic and internal affairs work together to ensure the fair turns into a success. The Führer's open blessing to this endeavor underlines once more how much sway does the Gang of Four hold over the German government...\n\nAt the committee's first meeting, after a first opening message by Albert Speer, in which he encourages its members to "amaze the world with the Reich's greatness", everyone starts working in earnest. As soon as the first folders are opened, already an important question arises, one which will influence all future works: what kind of event will the fair be?\n\nSome wish to create a reduced version of World Fair on the model of the great 1937 Paris fair, where the German pavilion towered over all others; members from the ministry of research propose a technological fair, where the greatest progresses of our scientists and inventors can be put on display for the world to look in envy; finally, more than a few voice their support for a very peculiar idea, which is a cultural fair: rather than showing industrial or technological progresses, how about showing the world that which makes our country unique? As no one wants to back from their position, the committee's head is forced to call a vote, and the final decision is..."

SPEERUSA.54.desc:0 "With the decision taken, the committee can now work head-on towards a World Fair, where all the progresses of the German nation as a whole can be put on display for the world to see and drown in its own envy: each country of the Pakt will have a place to put their culture and their national industry on display. Architects and artists from the Reich's most prestigious faculties and circles are called to design the pavillon, and the tycoons are already in line to have their work showcased.\n\nAs the first lines are drawn, however, a sore point immediately stands out: we are going to have an exposition in a country we fought, and defeated, a mere twenty years ago, and there are many who would strongly oppose all our government stands for; should we try to create a "neutral ground" for the fair, removing all symbols of our regime - especially the swastikas - or should we show the world what we truly are?\n\nOf course, the conservatives are outraged that such a thing is even being discussed: we are a National Socialist nation, and Hitler's guidance was what brought us from a defeated nation, to the world's greatest empire! Denying our legacy is a crime against those who lost their lives to make the Vaterland great!\n\nOn the contrary, reformist members, especially those aligned with Schmidt and Erhard, fear that the sight of a banner with the swastika might scare off American investors, and draw heavy criticism from the political establishment, compromising the fair's success: as such, they vocally ask to "tune down" on the symbols of what may be our political ideology, but risks hurting the feelings of our hosts.\n\nAs the discussion doesn't seem to end, the chairman sighs and calls for a vote on the issue: "those who are in favor of removing all political symbols, please raise their right hand!" and the result is..."

Delegates from the most prestigious universities, technical faculties and research institutes buth public and private flow in and out of the committee's offices, trying to get their work displayed. At the same time, the architects are already hard at work on the pavilion: it will be modern and functional with its straight lines and visible steel frame, but beautiful and full of light as the glass walls bathe everything in a complex game of lights and mirrors, giving the fair an out-of-the-world feeling.\n\nWhile everything goes smoothly, some of the committee members start to notice a worrying trend, as a large part of the exposition is being reserved for military inventions. As they point out to their colleagues, we are being hosted by a nation we fought with those exact weapons a mere twenty years ago: surely, their veteran associations and the conservative political establishment would strongly disapprove, or even boycott the fair!\n\nWhile some agree with this train of thought, others stand up, and reply that our new discoveries in the military field are extremely important, and will surely amaze the world! We won the world not thanks to poorly-armed conscripts, but with technological excellency and constant improvement!\n\nAs the discussion keeps going on, the committee head calls a vote to settle the matter once and for all: after the hands are counted, the fair will..."

The committee is already preparing the events which will take place in the various sections of the pavilion, from a small Oktoberfest directly from Bavaria, to traditional dances from Tyrol, Alsatian wines and Prussian cuisine: we shall show the world that we aren't what we were before, and that now there's space for happiness even in our war-torn country!\n\nA lighter atmosphere pervades the committee as reformists and conservatives can't find any truly divisive matters. The building itself fills with color as a variegated crowd enters the offices to vie for patronage: woodcarvers with their finest creations, patissiers bribing the members with an enticing offering of pastries and receipts passed from generation to generation, and even a choir in their traditional attire singing outside the office! The committee headquarters shine as it becomes, just for a few days, a melting pot of German culture.\n\nAs time passes, however, an issue arises. This time, however, the line of division isn't drawn between reformists and conservatives, but between "alcoholics" and "sanctimonious prudes" as they have started calling each other: as hundreds of beer distilleries have offered to sponsor the event, and many of them have asked to have their stands and stalls all throughout the exhibition, there is the question about whether to officially endorse the beer companies or keep the fair family-friendly.\n\nThe committee chairman calls for a vote on the matter, not before finishing his beer though..."

As the pavilions are dismounted, and everyone starts the long journey to their respective homelands, it's time to draw a final balance of the event: numbers are truthful, and the results have been... awesome!\n\nAlmost two hundred thousand people visited the German pavilion, and the various expositions inside were appreciated by everyone. The Amerikaner felt welcomed by the elaborately-decorated building, especially since, with the sole exception of the official flag of the Reich present here and there - the only point the Führer was adamant about - it was devoid of any national socialist symbol. The worries of the Gang of Four proved correct: without anything to criticize, the hawks within the American government were silenced, and everyone enjoyed the fair without any kind of polemic.\n\nWith the resounding success of the event spreading like a wildfire throughout the Vaterland, the reformists acquire even more power within the government, something which irks the Führer more than a bit. In the end, however, he knows this will benefit the Reich, and he'll be the one to ultimately reap the fruits of their efforts, so for the moment he has decided to keep his grumblings to himself, and influence the work of the Four with a lighter tough, as any true ruler knows how to do."

This moment was not to be taken lightly. /n/n Small talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever. /n/n Later, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany.

So, he accepts another glass of wine from the server, and they discuss the pros and cons of Alsatian and Bavarian wines compared to the omnipresent Italian ones, especially now that the entirety of Northern France no longer produces anything worth of note.\n\nThe evening soon turns into night, as the two parties socialize more and more, passing from topic to topic with a spontaneity that is almost unbefitting of seasoned diplomats, but with enough wine, everyone becomes a good friend! As the last desserts are finished, and the waiters begin clearing out the table from the used cutlery, everyone gets up, and all shake their hands before the Americans return to their diplomatic quarters.\n\nA second before boarding the car, Walter Dowling looks seriously at Schmidt: "I know what you are trying to do for your country, Helmut" he begins, opting for once to let go of diplomatic platitudes: "The United States are still unsure about how to truly consider your Führer, whether a true reformer or simply an astute liar, but as long as you are part of his government, I am willing to believe that this country can truly find a way to prosperity after what it has suffered. Good luck with that" and then he is gone, leaving a surprised Schmidt behind."

In truth, that this would happen was already an open secret: ever since the first news of what the Reich would bring to the fair were leaked to the American people, a wave of unanimous protest arose from all political parties, from the moderates to the hawks, against what the newspapers called 'a show that hurts the eyes'\n\nThe days following the grand opening weren't that much eventful, and indeed some visitors from the Reich and other aligned nations were well-welcomed by the personnel, but most of the American public remained far away from the pavilion. When the fair closed, the balance was judged 'sorely negative' and the reformists, like the legendary Cassandra, could only look sadly at the numbers with an expression that said 'I told you'\n\nPerhaps, the conservatives should choose to fight worthier battles..."

As the American public visits our stands, they meet and talk with our people, and learn that we aren't swastika-bearing, Hitler-worshipping, slave-driving monsters like some propaganda depicted us trying to prevent us from being invited to the fair. The more the Americans accept us as we are now, the faster we can improve our standing and recover from the destruction wrought by the Bürgerkrieg."

Our exhibitions and shows have amazed the Amerikaner, and they have visited our stands in numbers we couldn't even imagine.\n\nAs the pavilion is dismounted, and everyone starts their long journey home, the Führer has expressed his congratulations to the "heroes of the Reich abroad" who managed to "show the entire world how much we have changed" after all the sufferings we endured. Our diplomatic standing with the United States has also considerably improved, and Reichsminister Erhard already predicts a surge in foreign trade with members of the OFN!"

SPEERUSA.67.desc:0 ""Adolf Hitler was, shall I say, not the most popular figure outside of the Greater Reich, mein Führer." \n "Your point being, Herr Schmidt?" asked Speer. \n "Well, mein Führer, I was thinking it might be a prudent move for our administration to... distance ourselves from him. It'd be wise to demonstrate that we are no longer seeking the brutal conquest which was, of course, a cornerstone of Führer Hitler's foreign policy, you see." \n An awkward pause lapsed as Speer considered Schmidt's borderline treasonous suggestion. He chewed on the idea for several moments before nodding to himself and saying, "I can see how doing so would be beneficial to our diplomatic efforts, and it might even improve my personal image abroad. But of course, there will be strong resistance from many people here in Germany, especially the social conservatives. I trust you will help our administration deal with any backlash?" \n"Oh, why of course... mein Führer," replied Schmidt, who seemed to assume a noticeably brighter demeanor."

The sound of angry protestors and even a few "Heil Hitlers" could be heard not far from the Reichstag, which certainly helped to illustrate Speer's skepticism. \n "...Yes. Distancing ourselves from him is absolutely necessary, mein Führer," replied a distant and distracted Schmidt. "I need to go for a walk." Schmidt gave a timid but respectful salute to Speer and quickly exited the building. \n As he walked down Adolf-Hitler-Straße and past the Adolf-Hitler-Platz, Schmidt noticed the many lingering signs of war: former soldiers aimlessly walking the street, some with broken or missing limbs and some begging for spare change; a fair deal of unemployed non-veterans, too; and there were even some buildings that had leftover damage from accidental shelling or bombing during the Bürgerkreig in which so many had sacrificed so much simply for that cunning bastard Speer to enact a slightly less brutal and genocidal version of his predecessor's ideology. \n Adolf Hitler was a man who brought so much unnecessary suffering and destruction to the world. How could the German masses revere him so? Schmidt figured he'd have to emphasize the world's fear and hatred of the man and avoid non-starters like his absurd racial beliefs and genocide. It was a ridiculous and unfair situation, but like always Schmidt would just carry on and make the best of it."

SPEERUSA.69.desc:0 "As usual, the forty soldiers of the SS garrison were parading in front of the border, only stopping at the exact line dividing the two territories, and Rudolf Niedersen, commander of the Bretten Grenzwacht, looked impotently, as his men were far fewer due to the low budget. Suddenly, a call interrupted his rancorous thoughts: he answered, listened, and not five minutes later his men too were in parade at the sides of the road. The commanding SS looked at the ten watchmen, slightly amused: "Is this everything the mighty Reich can summon against the Righteous?" he spat at his counterpart. Then, the earth began to tremble.\n\nBefore the SS could speak again, a Panzer appeared from behind a building, and moved at full speed towards the border. The black-uniformed soldiers remained still as the tank got closer, closer, CLOSER. When only a few meters separated the armored beast from the soft flesh, Rudolf smiled in glee: the men in black took one step backwards, then two, and then everyone was falling in disorder as the Grenzwacht laughed.\n\nWith a loud noise, the tank halted one meter over the border. The SS returned, indignation etched over his face: "You are trespassing on the Ordensstaat! I demand that-" he stopped when faced with the barrel of Rudolf's pistol. "You hold no authority here, Verräter" he spat, feeling cruel joy in the way the other's face contorted. "This land belongs to the Vaterland, and you are unlawfully occupying it. There are no borders within the Reich, and the traitor you call "master" will soon understand it!"\n\nAs he spoke, several trucks unloaded a hundred Heer soldiers, who immediately set up building fortifications. The watchman looked the SS dead in the eye, and his voice was cold as steel: "It's only a matter of time before we return to Paris. Enjoy your black uniform while you can, for one day you'll hang from a balcony, and I'll be the one to push you DOWN" and for the first time, Rudolf saw fear in the eyes of the SS."

The black-uniformed German took the letter and gave it a cursory read: he already knew its content, as it was identical to the speech given by the Führer just the day before, then he put it into his pocket and returned to his position, without any outward sign of either interest or worry. After all, it was nothing but the formal certification of the current state of affairs\n\n"Citizens of the Reich, today is a sad day for our country. As Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler has refused to cede command and face due trial for his actions during the war which tore our country asunder, he is immediately relieved of any office and is to be arrested on sight for treason and mass murder.

But all of the pieces put together- the dimly lit but noble Lincoln sitting pleasantly in his chair, overlooking the steps leading down towards the reflecting pool and the Washington Monument in the distance... it evoked this... feeling inside of Schmidt. /n/n/ It was longing. Longing for better days, simpler times, and for leaders with as much honour and integrity as they used to have. No German politician valued liberty (openly) the way Abraham Lincoln did. Why did those in charge today care so damn much about what individuals said or did in the privacy of their own home or in the confidence of loved ones and friends? It was both immensely perplexing and infuriating to Schmidt. And then he realized what he longed for the most: a free and just world. /n/n/ "Ah yes, because it's that simple and easy...

The two officers saluted in unison with a simultaneous, "Heil!"\n\n Speer returned the gesture and stared at the map with a furrowed brow. "Let's hear your proposal, Generalfeldmarschall." He trusted the man little, and his military strategies less, but Speer knew better than to deny an audience with a man so influential in the militarist movement.\n\n "My proposal is simple," Schörner boasted, almost dismissively. He waved his hand generally across the land below him. "Warfare is fought in the mind as well as the battlefield. It's one thing to throw empty words at the Jews in the White House; it's quite another to strike true fear into their craven hearts." The hawk jabbed his finger close to the East Coast, and for a fleeting moment Speer thought he was about to argue for a declaration of war against the United States. "We should fly our strategic bombers straight towards internationally recognized American airspace, before turning away at the last moment! True fear will grip the Americans, and their leaders will be on paranoid alert, never knowing when a first strike is truly coming. I call it 'Schwarze Walküre'."\n\n"Herr Speer, this is far too risky!" Von Trescow shook his head in disbelief. Schörner glared at him with the shards of ice lurking behind his spectacles."What if our pilots fail to turn away in time? What if the Americans act prematurely?"\n\n "These mongrels slighted the Reich!" Schörner snapped, his spittle spraying across the map. "They're not stupid enough to retaliate, but it will teach them a lesson they won't forget."\n\nSpeer silently rubbed his chin in thought.

The teacher watched from the sideline, occasionally passing back a ball kicked out of bounds. Johann felt at ease here at school. Although scars maimed his face,, anyone who knew Johann could vouch for his giant heart. Johann was always calm, and tried his hardest to be fair and kind, to great success. Though they wouldn't admit it to his face, his students only sang praise about their teacher to his co-workers and their parents, to Johann's embarrassment. Still, it was welcome praise; the children gave him purpose. Although he had lost his pregnant wife in the civil war, being a mentor to the next generation of Germans gave Johann hope. Here he was, helping to raise a new generation, and he did so with much kindness. In a way, they were his family. He did however envy the children; not having to join a Nazi chapter to have friends or to particapate in the football clubs. They didn't have to know party politics to be able to swim at the local pool, nor they weren't judged by their devotion (or lack of) to Hitler's cult of personality. They could be children. It was a wonderful time to be young, and he was glad that he fought for that.\n\n The sound of jets roaring overhead nearly made Johann flinch, his reflexes almost taking control over his body, even after all these years. He took a deep breath. He had to stay composed for the children.\n\n Johann looked above, watching yet another airwing soar above his head, heading northwest, likely following the last hundred or so plans that came before that week. Another batch of strategic bombers. Worrying.\n\n As the children cheered and waved at the soaring planes above, the seed of worry in his head grew more. Why was there so much traffic in the air?

The man hung up the phone. "God damn Germans..." Smith muttered.\n\n No more than a minute passed before the President stormed into the Situation Room with their Secret Service attachment stalking close behind.\n\n "Who has my briefing?" The President barked. Shit. The currently overworked staff simply had no time to compile a folder. "Over here, sir!" Smith called as he rushed frantically from his desk to the map in the middle of the room. The President quickly stalked over to the large table, where tokens representing airplanes stood placed in the North Sea, red marker scrawls noting the planes' previous locations and their intended route; Iceland. Smith paced around the table, clearly nervous. "Sorry sir, we didn't have time to..." The President waved him off. "Forget the paperwork. What's the situation?" "Well sir..."\n\n "Five German strategic bombers, nuclear capable, are en-route to our bases in Iceland. NORAD has been tracking them for twenty minutes; they figured it was a long distance training mission. However, they haven't stopped their approach, and are heading right for our airspace. We've already scrambled an interceptor wing." A pause. "How many German planes total?" the President asked. "Is it a probe? A full scale invasion? Something else?" The Preisdents voice rose. "What the hell is this?"  Another tense second passed. "We don't know, sir." Smith replied flatly. "There looks to be twenty-five planes total,  including the five bombers. NORAD has no idea what their intent is, but they are REALLY stressing that those planes are nuclear capable. Most of that staff want us to hit them now to prevent a potential bombing. Most of the guys here..." Smith motioned to the ten or so men feverishly plotting routes and making phone calls. "...including myself believe that the Germans are making a show of strength and have no intent on crossing our airspace. We don't think they're trying to start a war. Still, our response is up to you, Mr. President, and I need your decision, now. An operator in Iceland is waiting for an answer."\n\n The President wordless walked to the nearest desk and dialed a number. The line immediately picked up. "Smith! The fucking Germans are ten minutes out! I need a goddamn answer, now!" Over the line, yelling and the sound of chaos rang in the background. "This is the President..." The line went silent. As if on cue, the background chatter died as if the call was on speaker. The Situation Room mirrored the silence. The President glaced around the room. All eyes were on him awaiting his word; his decision had the power to change the course of history. It was if the entirety of both rooms were listening to this call."

Eighteen of the twenty escorts, shot down. No pilots recovered, and no word from the Americans if they rescued any. I don't know what would be better; writing the letters to the families of brave men killed in defense of the Reich, or having to talk to the Americans about returning our men they captured. This is a disaster." The Führer sighed. "What the hell are we going to do?"\n\n Schörner pulled a folder that he had tucked away, and handed it to Speer. The Führer wordlessly opened the folder and read the proposal. A moment of silence passed.\n\n "Wow. The gall of you, Schörner." Schörner finally spoke. "This was an act of war. The militarists are up in arms and demand decisive action. There is no other..." "Are you fucking mad, man?" Speer snapped. Dropping his voice, "This would start a fucking war! Are you willing to give up everything for postering, for you and the military's ego?"\n\n Schörne glanced at his feet, then looked up. "If we don't respond... we look terribly weak on the foreign stage, and God knows what happens at home if we do NOTHING. That's why we chose Iceland. Small population, but important enough to show the world not to underestimate us. Ever.\n\n Speer's head dropped. "My Führer, it's a hard choice, but with your word, we can strike back tonight.

The room cheered; all approaching bombers had been splashed. This was followed shortly by, "Enemy fighters engaging, returning fire." The room sat in silence as the dogfight commenced over a thousand miles from the White House. Smith's stomach sank as a young man screamed "I'm hit, I'm hit!" before breaking up. Another American pilot, although calm, reported the same. He at least managed to confirm "Bailing out." before losing radio contact. The American fighters were quick to respond, twelve American interceptors who had been observing near their operational height limit dove down unto the approaching German formation, quickly scattering them, decisively changing the balance of power.\n\n After only half an hour, the crisis was over. The Germans just couldn't regain the initiative, and after a dozen confirmed kills, the rest of the formation scattered back to Germany. Both American fighters who had been shot down were promptly recovered, along with several Germans. The mood back in the White House wasn't enthusiastic, however.

Walter Dowling looks at the same time incensed by the rebuttal, but intrigued by the way the question had been put. "Surely democracy is better than all other forms of government!" is his immediate reply, "Men were born to be free, Helmut, and democracy is the only way such natural instinct can be satisfied: under a tyranny, there will always be resistance, and its eventual collapse is a matter of time"\n\nSchmidt understands that by talking in absolutes, this would lead nowhere, so he smiles courteously to his guest, and answers: "And yet the Reich is the result of democracy's failure, Walter. The democratic government of Weimar wasn't able to answer to the demands of the German people, and so it was replaced by a government which could meet such demands of order and rebirth. The results of this are well-known, and I believe I don't need to reminisce the events of the past two decades with you, my friend" he says, putting a bit of accent on the word "friend"\n\nDowling understands that going down this road may as well lead to the visit's failure, and also he has been taken aback by the German's point of view, so he decides to end the debate and directs an equally courteous smile towards Schmidt: "Indeed, our world is far more complex than what we would want to, isn't it?

Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind.

Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n "So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence.

As he continued to stroll down the familiar corridor, four younger men; all secretaries or scrubs scurried out of Speer's office. Schörner took a deep breath, and paused outside of the door. A loud bang closely followed by the sound of breaking glass came from the other side of the door. A curse, then silence. Schörner knocked.\n\n What the hell do you idiots want?!" Speer screamed. He was pissed. Schörner took another breath, then strolled in confidently.\n\n The office was a mess. It was clear that Albert Speer was in a rage; something Schörner  had never seen from the usually calm and collected man. Files and papers were strewn everywhere. A full sized mirror in the corner of the room was shattered into a million pieces, specks of blood strewn nearby. Pacing back and forth behind his desk was a disheveled Albert Speer, blood trickling down from his cut knuckles. He looked up and paused; his facing darkening when he realized just who had entered.\n\n "You." Speer spoke, then paused. Schörner, for once, had nothing to say. "Make your report, and make it quick."\n\n "My Führer," he began. For once, he spoke those words without any trace of comptemet. For once, the two were in complete agreement with what had to be done. There was no backing down now. "The U-Boats are off the coast of Iceland, as ordered. They are standing by on your..." \n\n Speer cut him off. "Did I not give you simple, easy, God damn instructions?" His tone was quieter now, but menacing. It was as if venom came from his lips.\n\n "Ah, uh, yes, sir." Schörner replied without stumbling over too many of his words. Describing Speer as 'frustrated' was definitely an understatement.\n\n "The caption refused the codes from me. Said procedure required him to hear the orders from your mouth." Speer merely stared at the general. Schörner, for his part, remained calm. He walked forwards with his typical confidence and handed Speer a note with a number on it. "The direct line, sir." Speer immediately punched the numbers into his land line.\n\n "Captain Von Steiner, reporting." The voice on the other end spoke calmly, as if rehearsed a thousand times."

The planes launched from Germany, came within a thousand meters of their airspace, then abruptly turned back, with no complications. In fact, there were even no mechanical issues. Everything went perfectly, in every sense of the word.  "What is the response from the Americans?" \n\n "Officially, none, my Führer. Unofficially? The Americans are scrambling over themselves; they aren't really sure what to do, and are paranoid as hell. We knocked them off balance without dropping a single bomb. Just as planned.""

Maybe to show strength. But from men like Charles Lindburg, these incursions were a pain in the ass. Because every week, the Germans did the same thing; five strategic bombers with twenty or so escorts flew towards an OFN base or airspace, and every time they did this, NORAD had to respond as if the Germans were about to strike. Planes had to be mobilized on next to no notice, bases had to be mobilized, and the Armed Forces freaked out. Every. God. Damn. Time.\n\n Lindburg was sick of it. His colleges were sick of it. The Navy man on the phone was pissed off and sick of it. But, everyone understood that, knowing the Germans, the one time NORAD doesn't react to a threat seriously would be the one time the Germans struck an OFN base. Life is fickle like that.\n\n The man in the phone continued to yell. "Twenty five! Twenty five bogies heading towards MY airspace! I want thirty, no, fifty interceptors circling above my HQ in ten minutes!" A loud BANG emitted from the phone. Lindburg winced and rubbed his ear as he put the cold plastic back on its base. What a prick. Lindburg didn't even rise from his desk; they were already scrambling nearly two dozen interceptors; no other fighters were close enough to respond within twenty minutes. Not that it would matter, because in ten, the Germans would abruptly break off their course and head home. God damn bastards. The man rubbed his temple, a thudding headache was starting to kill him.

If he deemed it necessary, then it must be, and he would carry out his duty.\n\n Worry embedded itself into the man's heart long after the planes streamed north-west.

The air-to-air missiles streamed past, leaving nothing but a red glare in their wake. He watched. Would he be so....\n\n "Yes!" he shouted as his, and his missile alone smashed into a bomber in the rear. Confirmed kill. Hell yeah. The triumph was short-lived. Over a dozen German fighters dove from above as the five escorts close to the bombers scattered, but not before launching their own barrage of missiles. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. A missle streamed right towards his plane. Shit. He slammed the joystick up in an attempt to evade. His reaction was quick, and almost perfect. In fact, if the green rookie hadn't been so fast, the missile would have flown straight into his cockpit; he would have been incinerated instantly. Instead, the midsection of the plane took the brunt of the damage. The jet started to spin helplessly out of control, rolling on all axes. "THIS IS 2-9! I'M HIT, I'M HIT! I'M GOING DOWN!" He looked at his consul in panic. No power. Had anyone heard him?\n\n The plane was in a hopeless tailspin, next to no control, losing altitude fast. Way too fast. The plane wouldn't stop rolling for a safe ejection. He would have to time this perfectly. He prayed as he grabbed the ejection lever. Would it work? Would he time the erratic movements of the plane just right? The plane spun right side up. He pulled the lever. Nothing.\n\n The plane tilted about ninety degrees before the canopy popped off and the seat ejected. A sideways ejection. SHIT. The man almost cried as he looked down at the fast approaching water. Is this how he died, on his first mission? No...no. Not like this. The pilot threw all of his body weight back, and miraculously, the chair leveled right side up.

The President scanned the room, and saw a familiar face pointing and writing in a notebook. What was his name... Smith?\n\n "What's the word on the ground?" the President asked as he approached the three men. Two of them scattered, running back to their desks while Smith feverishly lined out potential strike areas in Iceland. "You know as much as me, sir." Smith replied, still working. "Two minutes ago, a German submarine off the coast of Iceland rose to about a hundred meters and launched twelve ballistic missiles at Iceland." He finished tracing lines on the map. "Really? Speer would be so brazen?" Smith shrugged.\n\n "SMITH, SMITH, GET OVER HERE!" a nameless man yelled close by. Smith rushed over. The man punched a button on his phone, and the line went on speaker.\n\n "They're nuclear! I repeat, the missiles are nuclear! Reykjavik has been hit! We have no...." The President zoned out. Wordlessly, he found an empty stool around the war map and sat. After a minute, Smith walked back to the table, and wrote an X on all of the major harbors, cities, and most of the U.S bases and garrisons. Twelve red Xs scarred the map as nuclear fire likewise scarred Iceland. The Situation Room was dead quiet. Finally, Smith spoke.\n\n "Have we tried to raise the airforce in Iceland?" One man wordlessly rose his hand, then shook his head. "Nothing sir."\n\n Three minutes passed before an aerial reconansion confirmed their worst fears; the United States had been struck with nuclear arms.\n\n "Sir." Smith approached the President, who had yet to speak since the strike. "What...what do we do?" Quiet. Silence. Finally, a sigh. "I thought Speer was a reformer. Now look where we're at. Christ. God." The President paused. "We...we have to assume the worst. We have to act like the Germans are mobilizing the rest of their arsenal. God help us..."

SPEERUSA.119.t:0 "Ban Nazi Imagery"
SPEERUSA.119.desc:0 "The news that the committee will remove all imagery tied to national socialism from the fair to be held in Boston was met with outrage in the conservative wing of the NSDAP. While the Gang of Four is pleased by this development, as they know it will greatly help the fair's success, their opponents in the government accuse them openly of "betraying Hitler's legacy" and "selling our country for a few dollars" with several high-ranking party officials and bureaucrats signing an official request to the Führer to step in and "stop this madness"\n\nAs letter of protest pile on his desk at the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer can't help but understand the plight of the protesters. The Gang of Four clearly stands for something different that what he believes in, for something different from national socialism, and this fact sometimes infuriates him: if he could solve all of Germany's problem by removing those four bastards, he would have done that ages ago! Sadly, it isn't so simple: each of them is the best of the best in what they do, and even he has to admit they all love the Vaterland in their own, flawed way, and want to see it reborn, if under a different form.\n\nSighing, he takes another letter and reads it. He would like to simply throw them into the dustbin, but doing so would only enrage his own party even more. As he takes up the pen to answer the missive, he writes the same words for the umpteenth time: "Sehr geehrter Sekretär, though I understand your displeasure, and to some extent I even share it, the greatness of the Vaterland requires small sacrifices such as these to ensure we retake our legitimate place among the world powers. I will make sure that the honour of the Reich is upheld even in distant Amerika, and that no one dares to think the everlasting sun of National Socialism is setting on our empire! Yours truly, the Führer."

SPEERUSA.103.desc:0 "With the decision taken, the committee now resumes work, and the cadre of architects, sculptors and various artists tasked with designing the German pavilion can truly show how much they love their country! Paul von Esleben, a well-known architect and war veteran, has submitted the preliminary project for the pavilion, which was so well-liked by the Führer that he ordered for it to be immediately displayed on all official media as "the finest example of the Neue Moderne Nationalsozialistische Architektur" which, coming from Hitler's personal architect, goes much further than a mere political praise.\n\nThe building itself is a tall, cylindrical structure of steel and glass, representing the new Reich, tall and powerful, and yet transparent and modern, with four spyrals regularly intertwining symbolizing the conflict between the various souls of national socialism. At each junction, an eagle's head juts out, holding a flag with the Swastika to remember the battles fought between the contenders of the Bürgerkrieg.\n\nOf the four spirals, three interrupt roughly five meters before the top, where the last one turns from the usual color of steel to pure gold, just as Führer Speer managed to prevail over the flawed ideologies of his rivals and show how National Socialism was meant to be. Finally, the spiral reaches the top, where it flattens into a platform sustaining a golden swastika upon which stands perched Fritz Koenig's masterpiece, a massive eagle with its wings spread looking over Boston as a predator looks upon its prey.\n\nAs the entire Reich rejoices for such a display of national pride, we are sure to march towards a resounding success in Boston!"

Electronics and mechanics, civilian and military, the German future will be put on display for the world to drown in their own envy!\n\nNew computers from Siemens will prove their superior calculation speed, cars and trucks from Volkswagen will be an example of futuristic lines and powerful engines, and the latest tanks and fighter planes from Porsche and Heinkel will show the Amerikaner why choosing war over diplomacy would be a very poor choice!\n\nOf course, the more awe-inspiring prototypes have been 'leaked' to the German public, rousing patriotic support for the exhibition: we must capitalize on our renewed grandeur as much as possible, after all..."

We can't risk scaring our potential customers, not so soon after having managed to finally secure a trade treaty with the United States!\n\nAlready our largest companies are stepping forward to propose their latest designs, and several smaller research institutes and academies will have their own stands to show off advanced prototypes.

SPEERUSA.106.t:0 "Lots of German Beer"
SPEERUSA.106.desc:0 "In the end, the committee has chosen not to ban breweries from entering the fair, on the ground that beer is one of the oldest and proudest traditions of our already great country. The fact that the most ardent supporters of this thesis can often be seen toasting to anything coming to their mind in the most esteemed Brauhaus Georgbræu, surely has nothing to do with their opinion on the matter...\n\nAlready dozens of breweries, both ancient and new, are flooding - literally - the committee with their precious merchandise, hoping to get a stand in the fair building, and a "sampling under-committee" hurriedly forms to discern whether they are actually good beers or dirty water. As predicted, the volunteers are simply too many, and no one wants to cede their place, which prompts the chairman to select the members by extraction: of course, he "needs to be part of it" in order to "keep everything under control"

SPEERUSA.107.t:0 "A Family Fair"
SPEERUSA.107.desc:0 "Finally, the committee has decided to avoid conflicts with Amerikaner parent associations, and prevent any large concentration of alcoholic beverages at the fair. Even though beer is an important part of our Germanic heritage and culture, we can't let such an opportunity go to waste due to angry mothers complaining because their children want to taste that bubbling drink papa drinks himself to a stupor with every god-forsaken night.\n\nWe still have so much to show off! Toymakers and patissiers will give the children the kind of temptation no parent would ever deny, and we'll transfer an entire village from Tyrol, with the people clad in traditional garbs, with their own cuisine, even sheeps and cows: the families will absolutely love it!"

Anonymous sources within his bureaucracy state that Germany has approved a new operation. Codenamed "Schwarze Walküre", or "Black Valkyrie," this operation appears to be a German attempt to probe American and OFN airspace with massed air wings, including nuclear capable strategic bombers. German intentions are not clear at this time, but this appears to be a direct result of collapsed diplomatic overtures between the United States and German Reich. Forigen observers warn that already high tensions may raise even more, and caution that limited conflict could result.\n\n It is unknown what the end results will be, but the world holds its breath as America and Germany square off."

One of the first destinations on his trip is Los Angeles, California. Upon his arrival, he seemed to be somewhat bothered by something, especially when passing by the military checkpoints barring entrance to the Japanese-controlled port area. Mr. Schmidt did seem mildly interested in the various landmarks he saw such as the Griffith Observatory and Venice Canals, but at the end of the day did appear to be somewhat disappointed. Whether Schmidt's reaction was our fault or not is difficult to say, but surely he will enjoy the many other destinations he is scheduled to visit over the coming weeks."

Luckily, in NYC, it isn't very difficult to show a man a good time, and he was taken to all of the classic destinations across the city; Central Park, Times Square, the Empire State, the Statue of Liberty, you name it. Schmidt was particularly excited and enthralled by the unique and "rough around the edges" character of New York, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy his day here. Hopefully the rest of his tour will be as thrilling as the Big Apple, but they call it The City that Never Sleeps for a reason!"

SPEERUSA.111.t:0 "The Unity Fair"
SPEERUSA.111.desc:0 "One of several events arranged by the Germans in the US as a goodwill gesture, the Unity Fair in Boston has been an unexpected success. Akin to the World Fairs that seem to happen few and far between these days, the Unity Fair has contained impressive displays of German architecture, science, technology, and culture in a manner that may have come off as slightly boastful or intimidating to some of the fair's attendees. But nagging in the minds of all who attended was the fact that restoring ordinary relations with the Germans could grant the United States unmitigated priority access to all of this incredible economic and human capital. /n/n And so, our people's reception to the Unity Fair was actually quite positive, with many of our citizens being rather impressed by what the Reich's best had to offer. Boston's mayor gave a brief speech thanking Germany for creating such a fun and exciting event, and at that point it seemed as if the Germans' ambitious diplomatic mission was not so out of reach as initially thought."

SPEERUSA.112.desc:0 "The final stop of his goodwill tour, German Foreign Minister Schmidt has arrived in Washington, D.C. From what we have heard from staffers present with the German delegation, the uncontested highlight of the visit for Mr. Schmidt was his stop at the (admittedly very lovely) Lincoln Memorial. /n/n Despite the supposedly much more impressive works and exhibits of Germania, Schmidt was apparently mesmerized by the statue and stood silently in its presence for several minutes. According to one staffer who was known to embellish his stories, a single teardrop could even be seen in Mr. Schmidt's eye. Either way, he seemed to very much appreciate the memorial and the great American values it stands for."

From hunting in the vast woods of northern Maine, to visiting the native-created Etowah Mounds in Georgia, to touring towns, factories, and other landmarks all over the Eastern Seaboard, the Germans have hopefully garnered a much better understanding of American culture and livelihood. We have at the very least given the foreign minister a highly interesting trip, and hopefully the hospitality we've shown to the representatives of our ostensible enemies will bear fruit in the form of improved relations."

 SPEERUSA.114.t:0 "Fear and Loathing in Reno"
 SPEERUSA.114.desc:0 "Another event arranged (but not attended) by German Foreign Minister Schmidt, a German guest appearance at the Reno Air Show has (literally) turned some heads. While anyone even a year ago would have laughed at the idea of the Luftwaffe performing along with the US Air Force, attendees at the show had to admit that the German squadron was very impressive. Their maneuvers were executed flawlessly, and one hairpin turn even managed to elicit a few gasps and a small applause. It's safe to say that US-German diplomacy now has one more success under its belt."

But, we have to admit that we were pleasantly surprised and entertained by a number of quality films. Not all of them were too memorable, but one drama in particular starring a renowned comedy actor named Heinz Rühmann seemed to strike a chord with its audience. /n/n Perhaps, if relations do continue to improve, there could be a strong collaboration between our film industries, which could ultimately even lead to a strengthening of cultural ties between the US and Germany. Maybe that's getting a little ahead of ourselves, but nevertheless we can consider this evening to be a modest success."

Intended to be a grand exposition akin to the World's Fairs of decades past, the fair has instead reinforced the many negative cultural stereotypes our populace holds about Germany and its people. The site was covered head to toe in swastika-themed paraphernalia, which was a huge mistake considering that Americans do not react positively to the symbol they've learned to hate after years of German conquest and American propaganda. /n/n While the actual quality of the cultural and scientific displays was very impressive, the fair simply seemed to portray the Germans as humourless fanatics, which doesn't bode too well for our attempts to improve their image in the minds of the American people. Luckily, there are many more events and visits to come where this error can be rectified."

However, an olive branch is a welcome gift in these parts, and, in a changing world, the more friends Washington has, the better. The letter was well addressed and complimentary, and the trip does sound delightful. Seeing the sights of Hamburg, a true European city of tradition and grace? Surely it couldn't be too bad. \n\n"

Now, a rebellious plague sweeps the city, and its carrier is the fiery naivety of German youth. \n\n We know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the American's arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things. \n\n Thankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful.

 #Slave Siege chain

speerflavor.1.t:0 "Planning Rebellion"
speerflavor.1.d:0 "The back alley of the Kruppstrasse in Frankfurt was a damp and dingy place at night, rarely visited or checked by any of the passing guards. Flanked by 4 wings of the local Krupp factory, each producing their own variant of metalworks, it was a perfect place for meetings of the more secretive kind. Indeed, it was this exact reason why the man silently stood against the wall, waiting for his comrades to join him.\n\nOne by one, they made their way out of the blocks they called home, sneaking over to the same wall and avoiding the lazy flashlight beams that occasionally flicked down the road. When the last conspirator, a man of slim frame, squeezed out of the hole in the wall of his barracks and slid over to the wall, the first man blew a sigh of relief. He was the one that the first man had prayed would return.\n\n "So, Rasmus. How did they respond?"\n\n"Wing A is ready. They're practically chomping at the bit to go now."\n\nThe second man barely held in a laugh of glee. "Holy shit, it's really all coming together! I never thought I'd see the day we all grew balls and went after the Germans!"\n\n "It's a goddamn miracle, Mykyta." Said the third man, a faint smile crossed his lips. Out of all of the men, he had been a slave for the longest, toiling for years over his machines and tools, always at the mercy of the Nazis. Finally, the slaves were taking back some control.\n\n "Jan. You wanted to be the one to start the fight, didn't you?" Asked the first to the third. Jan's smile widened again.\n\n "Mikhail. You don't even have to ask- I'd start it myself, with or without you."\n\n "Then it's settled." MIkhail straightened himself up, shifting his uncomfortable slave uniform around. "Tell your friends- we're going in 3 days. We'll overpower the guards, capture the factory, and get out."\n\n "And then?" Nikita asked.\n\n "And then," Mikhail continued, "We're free.""

speerflavor.2.t:0 "A Crash, a Shot, and a Revolt"
speerflavor.2.d:0 " A crash rose above the standard noise of the factory floor, and like the moment after a thunderclap, all went silent. The guard, who had been slowly making his way around the floor, perked up for a moment. It was not often that he got to punish a slave anymore- indeed, for the last few days, they had been more quiet than ever. He had not been the only one to notice this- the guards in the other wings had complained about the slowness of the last days just as much as he had. Of course, he was sure the executives who watched over it all didn't mind- less disturbances meant more productivity. Now, however, the guard had his chance to finally enjoy the power of his job.\n\nThe other slaves seemed to part like a wave as he pushed his way through to the offender, an older man who the guard had seen- and punished- many times before. Splayed out across the floor lay the box of tools the slave had been using. A foolish error, and one that would not go unpunished, thought the guard.\n\n"Pick that up." stated the guard, pointing to a wrench that lay close to his feet. The man did not move. The guard smirked- a rebellious streak had always been apparent in this one. He resolved to teach him a few lessons in manners as he pulled out his baton. Quickly and forcefully, he pushed the man back with it, planting the tip squarely in the slave's sternum.\n\n"Pick it up, boy." The guard said again, louder and more threatening than before. Still, the man did not move. The guard responded by striking the man to the ground with a swing from the baton. Finally, the slave crawled over to the wrench and picked it up, standing as he did so. The guard smiled, his victory confirmed.\n\nHis smile would remain on his face up until the slave, whirling around, slammed the wrench directly into his jaw.\n\nHe collapsed to the ground, stars whirling around his vision. In a mix of anger and rage, he reached for his gun, raising it towards the rebellious ingrate. His shot went wild into the ceiling as a multitude of hands grabbed him, knocking him back to the floor and wrestling the pistol from his hands. Across the factory floor, the sounds of chaos replaced the previous silence, and the guard could only wonder how long the slaves had waited for this day before he lost consciousness."

speerflavor.3.d:0 "In the chaos of the Kruppstrasse, one man made his way quickly through the crowd of slaves. Jan still held the wrench that had started the whole affair close to his chest as he pushed through the turmoil, searching for his fellow leaders. It was a difficult task, made more difficult by those who recognized him trying to give their compliments and praise. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of pushing and shoving, he reached the other three. Mykyta, Mikhail, and Rasmus all stood on a metal catwalk above the street, watching as hundreds of slaves either made a break for freedom, grabbed weapons from the now wide-open doors of the factory armories, or barricaded the streets in preparation for the inevitable police response. As Jan joined them, Rasmus's eyes locked onto a chain of guards and executives, all being led into one factory as hostages. They were not the only ones.\n\n"-took longer than we thought to clear out Wing 4, but we got it in the end - look at that, it's the man of the hour." Rasmus turned to Jan, a smile crossing his face. "How'd Wing 2 go, Jan?"\n\n "Perfect. I really nailed the son of a bitch who went after me. If you guys see a guard with a fucked-up mouth, tell him I said hello. How about you fellows?"\n\n"Wing 1 and 3 went smoothly as well" Mikhail chimed in, "though Wing 4 took a little longer than we hoped. The men there didn't realize we had started until the guards began locking the place down. In any case, the whole plan succeeded so far."\n\nThe men looked back down onto the street, watching the turmoil. Jan's eyes latched onto one group of slaves, currently making a break for it out into Frankfurt. They reached the corner where the Kruppstrasse turned onto another street, then froze. Suddenly, each of them dashed back to the barricades, inaudibly shouting. A wave of commotion swept through those who still were inside the barricades.\n\nAs each of the leaders turned towards the frenzy, the source of the chaos became apparent. 3 police cars sped past the corner, sliding to a stop with a screech of tires. They sped off just as quickly when a hail of panicked gunshots rained down the street, bullets pinging off their cars as they got out of the area.The 4 men looked at each other, each realizing what was to come.\n\n"I'll get defenses set up." Mykyta said, turning to the stairs. "Be prepared for anything. And, brothers, if this becomes our last stand, make sure to take as many of them with you as you can."\n\nThe men said nothing. There was work to be done."

speerflavor.4.d:0 "Johann's patrol car was not used to moving so quickly, and screeched its protest to being treated so roughly at every corner. Inside the car, Johann himself listened intently to the police radio- even with his full attention directed onto it, it was a struggle to make out independent facts or statements with the amount of information flowing in. Tales of escaping slaves causing havoc through Frankfurt- Johann swerved to avoid a scattering group of them as he listened- were swiftly cut off by reports of general chaos, multiple gunshots, and an increasingly flustered radio operator trying in vain to restore order on the airwaves. None of this mattered to Johann- he had his orders, and he already knew what he was supposed to do.\n\n2 patrol cars, evidently headed to the same location as he was, fell in behind him as he continued to roar down the main avenues. Cars lay abandoned at the side of the road as the police cars roared past, evidence of the growing chaos that was engulfing the industrial side of town. Finally, Johann and the others pulled up to the perimeter that had been set up, and witnessed a scene of pure chaos.\n\nWhile the street itself was empty- the police presence had been enough to scare any running slaves back to their holes- a full block had been abandoned to the rebellion, with the perimeter having been set up just around the corner from where the rebellious factory was located. Worried, angry, and above all else confused officers chattered to each other, setting up their own police barricade. Curious onlookers watched anxiously from windows and balconies, though they made sure to be out of the way of any potential gunfire. Johann stepped out of his car and made his way to the nearest face he recognized. The sergeant quickly snapped to attention as he saw the captain approach.\n\n"Wachtmeister Schneider. Status report, if you will." Johann said curtly.\n\n"It's like nothing I've ever seen before, Oberstleutnant. They've flipped containers and made them barricades, they've boarded up doors and windows, they've got weapons everywhere- they've built a damn fortress." Schneider panted. Johann kept walking, heading towards the corner that stood between the police and the revolters. He stuck his head around for a moment to confirm what Schneider had said.\n\nEven though Johann had fought in the Civil War, his mouth nearly fell open at the spectacle of a barricade, defended by slaves still in their working clothes, armed to the teeth with rifles, pistols, and shotguns. It, indeed, was like nothing he had ever seen before. His shock was so great that it took Schneider to pull him back around the corner when multiple bullets cracked off the wall.\n\n"Herr Oberstleutnant, you see what I mean, yes?" Schneider asked. Johann stayed silent for a moment, then responded."

speerflavor.5.t:0 "Emergency Meeting"
speerflavor.5.d:0 "Speer wanted to bury his face in his hands. Of course this would happen to him. The only time a slave revolt ever succeeds, and it's under him. Across from him sat the men of the Gang of Four, each looking similarly downtrodden as Speer. Next to them sat Hans Speidel, calm as always, though his uncomfortable fidgeting did betray a hint of worry. Each of these men would occasionally look over to the phone on Speer's desk, which at any second was all but certain to ring with the voice of Ferdinand Schörner. Speer could already imagine the look of glee on Schörner's face as he heard the news, and he shuddered to think of the tongue-lashing that would come.\n\n"So." Speer quietly said,"How many slaves were in the factory?"\n\nHelmut fidgeted uncomfortably. "Around 800, my Führer."\n\n"Christ." Speer sighed. "And how many do we estimate are still fighting?"\n\nA long, uncomfortable silence punctuated the air as each of the men in the office looked at each other. Finally, Speidel spoke up."We estimate between 200 and 300, but there's no way of knowing how many are inside the wings."\n\nSpeer audibly groaned. "I don't see why we don't move in, take the factory back, end this mess.\n\n"With the amount of hostages they've got in there?" Schmidt questioned. "We'll be lucky if we get ten of them out alive if we throw the Wehrmacht in." \n\n"Besides that," Kiesenger interrupted, "We've already received some ground reports that students from nearby universities are aiding escaping slaves hide from police patrols. Their reaction to a full-blown shootout may be. . .ugly."\n\n"Must we speak of the politics of the matter? This is the worst hostage crisis we've faced in our history." Speidel interjected. "Now, if you would allow me, I have a plan-"\n\nThe phone rang, and each of the men tensed. Slowly, Speer picked it up. He listened for a moment, then held the receiver away from his ear to notify the others."

How could you expect any good citizen to be calm in such a situation?"\n\nThe 5 other men in the room could barely make out Schörner's voice, tinny and canned as it was. Speer himself could hear all too much of it- the Field Marshal was practically screaming into his ear. He leaned back in his chair, distancing himself from the receiver. If he didn't, the urge to hang up on the man would eventually overpower him.\n\n"So what's your suggestion, Ferdinand? I'm sure I can guess the gist of it." He asked. There was a moment of silence on the other end, and the rest of the room leaned in to hear it better.\n\n"Send in the tanks, the armored cars, the planes, the Wehrmacht. Take them out-" Each of the men in the room reacted in their own special way. Schmidt threw his hands up in the air, Speidel sighed, and the other men of the Gang exchanged looks of displeasure. Speer, however, remained silent."-as fast as you can, casualties be damned. If we give them even an inch, they'll take a mile, and we'll lose control in days."\n\n"We'll consider it." Speer flatly stated, placing the phone face up on his desk. Schörner's continued rant went unnoticed in the commotion that followed.\n\n In a moment, the Gang began to shout over one another in their objections. Cries of "Murderer", "Pig", and "Idiot", which Speer decided to assume were directed at Schörner, rebounded through the room. Speer's face remained unmoved. Finally, Speidel stood, and the rest of the men silenced themselves.\n\n"My Führer, I think you should hear me out before you make any choices on the matter. I believe your council has a suggestion as well, judging by that. . .outburst." Speidel stated. The Gang, led by Schmidt, voiced their agreement."
speerflavor.6.a:0 ""Very well. Speak, Herr Speidel.""

speerflavor.7.t:0 "Speidel's Plan"
speerflavor.7.d:0 "Hans Speidel took a deep breath. Each of the men around him watched his every move, his every twitch. He made sure to minimize any nervous fidgeting before he began.\n\n"My proposal is similar to the Field Marshal's proposal, though I will say it is more refined than the blunt solution my colleague provides. In short, there is no way that this situation can be dealt with in such a. . .heavy handed way, if you wish to keep casualties low. However, if we negotiate, we give in to the slaves and their threats. Every slave in the Reich will see us give in and assume that they can do the same. We'll see revolts across Germany within a month if we give in, mark my words."\n\n"You coward! What you suggest would take far too long to do. The news will be all over Germany by the time your plan is ready, and then-" Schörner shouted to make himself audible through the phone. Speer paused for a moment to listen before motioning for Speidel to continue, placing his hand over the speaker to muffle the noise.\n\n"My suggestion would be to take a slow, cautious, yet tough approach on these slaves. An infiltration, coordinated with our best units, could potentially result in catching the rebels off guard. If we do this right, we could seize control of the factories without too much bloodshed. My top men have already begun drawing out a plan, if you wish for it."\n\n"You idiot. You're ruling out even trying to negotiate because of what you think will happen? You're no better than the butcher on the other end of that telephone." Schmidt loudly objected. The rest of the Gang nodded, though their reaction was much less strong than that of Schmidt.\n\n"I'm not suggesting we go in and kill all of them, Helmut, I'm suggesting we put this down before it spreads!" Speidel wheeled around angrily. A shouting match erupted before Speer, with a hearty slap of his table, brought everyone to order. He sighed before turning to Schmidt."
speerflavor.7.a:0 ""Herr Schmidt, the floor is yours.""

speerflavor.8.t:0 "Schmidt's Proposal"
speerflavor.8.d:0 "Schmidt stood, the rest of the Gang watching him closely. He cleared his throat before he began, making sure to stand as upright as he could. Speer watched him intently as he began.\n\n "My Führer, while the other proposals that your generals have brought before us could certainly hold some merit, the fact remains that they are simply too harsh to be considered. If we pull off any form of military maneuver against the slaves, the liberals you rely on so heavily will explode. After all, would such an oppressive maneuver not directly contradict your supposed wish to free the slaves? No, if you wish to come out of this with your hide intact, you must come to the table with the slaves. This doesn't mean we have to give in to all their demands, of course, but a negotiation would certainly go down well with your base. Besides, while Herr Speidel seems to think negotiation would encourage revolt, I believe it would have the opposite effect. After all, would the slaves not believe you truly mean what you say if you talk to a revolting group?"\n\nSchörner's voice cut in at a volume loud enough for all to hear. "You traitor! You imbecilic fool! You think the slaves can be negotiated with? You think this WON'T encourage lawlessness? My Führer, I cannot stand with such a ridiculously stupid action!"\n\nSpeidel uncomfortably cut in on Schörner's continued rant. "While it pains me to say it, I have to agree with Schörner on this point. Negotiation, as I said, only breeds further revolt. To give in is to set the precedent that we are willing to give in to violence and chaos. We'll only see unrest if we give in for stability's sake."\n\nSchmidt did not take this rebuttal lightly. "You only think this because you're too wrapped up in discipline to see the human side of things! We're running out of time to make a decision here, my Führer! If we don't negotiate, blood will run through the streets of Frankfurt, and our claim to reformism and slave freedom will be forever damaged!"\n\nSpeer sat in silence for a moment, running through all the possibilities he could think of. The men in the room stood silently, waiting for a reaction that could change Germany forever."
speerflavor.8.a:0 ""We must be strong. Herr Schörner, do what you must.""

speerflavor.9.t:0 "Do What We Must"
speerflavor.9.d:0 "The room, which only a second ago was nearly bursting, now flipped to uncomfortable silence. Speer became keenly aware of the stares of disbelief, rage, and disappointment that bored into him. The only noise now was the crackling of the telephone. Speer could even imagine Schörner staring into his receiver in shock.\n\n"Of course, my Führer." Was all that Schörner said before the line went dead with a loud click. Immediately, total chaos consumed the room, quickly rerouted into the lightning rod of pure rage that was Helmut Schmidt.\n\n"You goddamned MADMAN! You just killed 200 innocent souls, you heartless bastard! What sort of reformist are you? Free the slaves, huh? I didn't realize you meant freeing them from the fucking mortal coil!"\n\n "You will show respect to my decisions, Herr Schmidt. I am still your Führer!" Speer rose from his own chair in anger. Schmidt refused to sit down, despite the worried taps on his thigh by Kiesenger.\n\n "You shut the hell up, you two-faced rat! What will the people think!? What will the international community think!? Did you put an iota of thought into this before you chose death for hundreds?"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, you shall not insult me, and you certainly shall not tell me to shut up!"\n\n"I couldn't care less what you say-" Kiesenger shoved Schmidt hard, and the man caught himself. Breathing deeply, Schmidt paused for a moment. His voice strained against his restraint as he continued. "I think it would be best if I retired for the night." With that, Schmidt left the room. The rest of the Gang closely followed, stopping only to glare at Speer, undoubtedly holding their tongues.\n\n "Herr Speidel, I made the right call, you must understand. The Heer can't think we're going too far, and the conservatives would shred me if I didn't. . ." Speer trailed off. Speidel said nothing, instead briskly turning and exiting, leaving Speer to reflect on his own decision."

speerflavor.10.t:0 "Do What We Can"
speerflavor.10.d:0 "The room processed Speer's words for a moment. A small grin spread across Speidel's face, a frown crossed Schmidt's, and various looks of acceptance flashed across the Gang's face. Slowly, Speer turned to the phone, which now sat deathly silent on the table. All eyes turned to the receiver, as the men braced for the explosion.\n\n After a moment, Speer grew concerned as to what Schörner was up to. "Herr Schörner, did you catch what I said?"\n\nThere was another moment of long, uncomfortable silence. Finally, the tinned voice of the Field Marshal returned. "Loud and clear, my Führer. Know that I am fully against this half hearted weakness." The line shut off with a menacing click.\n\n"My Führer, thank you for seeing reason. I promise you, we will not disappoint you in our endeavors. We'll have results shortly." Speidel turned and exited the room. Speer could almost envision the gears clicking away in Speidel's head, turning fiercely as he began to work on the problem at hand.\n\n"My Führer, while I can't say I'm in support of this measure, I will say it's a better choice than what you could have done. I hope you'll have mercy the next time one of these situations crop up." Schmidt spoke quickly and curtly. Speer could detect a hint of frustration in the man's voice, but said nothing in return. Finally, Schmidt left the room. Each of the other Gang members shared their own thoughts, none particularly positive, before departing. Speer sat alone in his room now, leaning back as he tapped his fingers on the desk. He turned to the window, the night sky sprawling over the Germania skyline. He exhaled a breath he had barely realized he was holding in. To nobody in particular, he said-"
speerflavor.10.a:0 ""I think I handled that well.""

speerflavor.11.t:0 "Do What We Will"
speerflavor.11.d:0 "The room, which had been almost bursting with sound, went dead silent. Speidel's eyes shot to Speer in disbelief, Schmidt's eyes widened, and the rest of the gang's attention quickly shot directly to the phone. The moment of silence would not last for long.\n\nThe telephone on the desk, which had been almost forgotten about in the chaos, quickly grabbed everyone's attention with a screech of static. Schörner's voice, now almost as loud as if he had been in the room, exploded from the speaker so ferociously that the phone nearly rattled off the table.\n\n "My Führer, you can't be serious! Are you truly suggesting that we not only put down a rebellion, but negotiate with them? They're slaves! If we negotiate, we give into decadent, lesser races! We give in to those we own! Do you honestly think that the other slaves will look at us give in to a slave revolt and not get the idea to do the same?"\n\n "Herr Schörner, I've thought this over, and this is the obvious solution if our agenda is to be followed and believed. Besides, your solution is less of a fix and more of a massacre." Speer flatly replied. The look on his face clearly betrayed his opinion on the Field Marshal to the other men in the room.\n\n "My solution may not be weak enough for you bleeding-hearts, but it will work! I cannot, in any way, support such a foolish, naive choice-"\n\n "Well, Herr Schörner, I'll take your complaints into consideration." Speer spat as blandly as possible, before unceremoniously placing the phone back in the receiver. Almost immediately, he was beset upon by Schmidt, who spent the better part of the next 5 minutes praising Speer's choice before rushing from the room, quickly being followed by the gang. Speidel stuck around a little longer to give his thoughts, mostly cautionary words against excessive looseness to revolters, though Speer could tell he was holding back some of his more choice words.\n\nFinally, when everyone was gone, Speer leaned back in his seat and stared out of his window. He couldn't help but think of the fiery speeches against him that were sure to come from all sectors. It was certainly going to hurt him with the Heer and the conservatives. Indeed, he almost regretted his choice for the amount of problems it would open up. At the end of the day, though, at least he knew it was the moral one."

speerflavor.12.t:0 "The Invasion"
speerflavor.12.d:0 "It had been almost a day since the siege had begun, and there seemed to be no end to the standoff. Mykyta watched from the factory window as his fighters patrolled the barricades, weapons in hand. It had been a very busy 24 hours, but it was certainly some of the most exciting of his entire life. He noticed Mikhail coming up as well, and sighed at the loss of his peace. Mikhail had been jumpy the entire time, pacing the factory for hours.\n\n "What's up?" Mykyta asked Mikhail. Mikhail said nothing, instead lighting his cigarette. Mykyta waited a moment for a response.\n\n "It's not that something's happening, it's that nothing's happening. No negotiation, no infiltration, they're just waiting for something." Mikhail exhaled. \n\nIt was at that moment when an explosion rocked the barricade in front, sending men flying across the compound. In an instant, all was chaos. Gunfire filled the street as Wehrmacht soldiers, dressed in full battle gear, charged the factory. The slaves put up a fight, and both Mikhail and Mykyta saw their fair share of Wehrmacht soldiers fall, but any hope of the attack being repulsed ended when a Leopard, machine guns spitting lead, rolled over the remains of the barricade. Its gun blasted a high explosive shell directly into wing A, blowing apart the flimsy walls of the factory like a house of cards being hit with a sledgehammer.\n\n "Mykyta, I think this is the end." Mikhail said quietly, as more and more vehicles began to overrun the factory. Mykyta was silent for a minute, watching the end of his dreams. The revolt had ended not as he hoped, but as he expected. Now, all that was left was to go out in as much a blaze of glory as they could."

speerflavor.13.d:0 "The room seemed to fit the mood of those inside it very well- dark and cold. Speer sat behind his desk, the Gang sat in their assorted chairs, and Speidel stood. All of them sat in uncomfortable silence, processing the news they had heard.\n\n "Well. Herr Speidel, you have the numbers, correct?" Schmidt took the liberty of starting the conversation, obviously not wanting to let Speer control what was said. Speidel stirred uncomfortably at being prompted by Schmidt, clearly catching on to Schmidt's plan, but went ahead anyway.\n\n "Numbers are incomplete, but, ah, we currently have about 191 slaves confirmed deceased, with about 100 more in custody with various wounds. Wehrmacht casualties are about 35 confirmed KIA, with one armored car disabled- hit by a Molotov. 62 have reported wounds, mostly minor bruises and scratches."\n\n "And, out of the estimated 70 hostages they were holding, how many did we recover?"\n\nSpeidel paused, hesitating to read the result. Finally, he spoke up. "None."\n\n "So that makes, what, about 300 dead? 300 innocent souls lost. Incredible. If only there was some other way we could have gone about this operation-"\n\nSpeer spoke up firmly. "Helmut, we've gone over this. I am not going to-"\n\nHelmut raised his voice over Speer's. "If only we could have negotiated, or taken any other means of attack that wasn't rolling a fucking tank over them!"\n\n "Herr Schmidt, I'm warning you-" Speer raised his voice in return. Schmidt ignored him, instead raising his voice to a near yell.\n\n "But no, this was clearly the right choice, right? 300 dead, but-"\n\n "Herr Schmidt, you are dismissed from this meeting!" Speer yelled angrily, and the room fell silent again. Slowly, Schmidt packed his folders and left, the Gang quickly following. Speidel left a few seconds afterwards, leaving Speer to reflect on his actions."

speerflavor.14.d:0 "It started out as a trickle. State media, of course, would not be covering such a stunning thing as a slave revolt in full detail (instead framing it as "minor unrest") so the information was passed through word of mouth. Telephones around Germany rang with the tales of gunshots, tanks, and machine guns rattling off, leading to many in universities across the Reich becoming glued to their phones. In Frankfurt itself, students watched from their windows as tank after tank rolled over university avenues and roads. It soon became apparent what they were here to do.\n\nThe massacre may have been ignored by the press, but it certainly wasn't ignored by the people. The telephone lines from Frankfurt nearly jammed with the sheer volume of calls sent across the Reich. In universities from Cologne to Königsberg, the youth of Germany heard uncensored, unfiltered accounts of chaos and death, directly caused by the government they had supported and trusted. Their reaction to the news was as one would expect.\n\nWithin two hours, spontaneous protests had erupted across any city with a major university in it, grinding the streets to a halt.\n\nWithin three hours, the protests were riots, and the police was backed up by whatever Heer forces were on hand.\n\nWithin five hours, the streets were lit by the flames of burnt-out cars and broken Molotovs, and the air was choked with tear gas and smoke.\n\nWithin eight hours, the streets were empty once more, leaving those who had cleared them to pick up the pieces. One thing was clear, though- the student's faith in Speer had shattered, and it was doubtful he could ever regain it."

The early morning mist had dampened the paper somewhat, but it didn't matter to Mateusz, who reached out of a crack in his window to pick it up, sliding it into the cold barrack before slamming the window shut again. As he pulled the rubber band off the roll, he could only thank God that one of his friends had managed to strike a deal with a group of sympathetic students. It had let him and his fellow bunkmates stay informed, a luxury that many fellow workers did not possess.\n\nAs his friends gathered around him, he flipped through the first pages. It was the standard news, mostly, until he hit the fourth page. There, in the center of the page, one block of text was circled in black marker.\n\nThe title read "Minor Unrest in Frankfurt's Factories", but the words written in marker screamed "SUCCESSFUL SLAVE REVOLT- PUT DOWN BY HEER"\n\n "Holy shit, a slave revolt? I never thought I'd see the day." said one man behind him. "Christ, it says they put them down. Wonder what that looked like." said another. "Brave motherfuckers, the lot of them. Wish we could rise up like that." said a third.\n\nMateusz remained silent. Slowly, he rose, facing his friends.\n\n "You see this? This is the proof that we can overcome our so-called masters. The slaves in Frankfurt had enough of the whip and the baton, and they rose up, and you know what? They succeeded. They may have been put down, but they took over their factories. These men are the first to challenge the Germans, but they will certainly not be the last."\n\nHe took a breath, the men hanging onto every word.\n\n "And, hell, if they revolted against their guards and succeeded-""

Each man in there- Speer, Schmidt, and each of the other members of the Gang- watched the door patiently, awaiting Speidel's arrival. Finally, almost 20 minutes after the meeting was supposed to begin, Speidel made his way into the room, carrying multiple folders and dropping them on Speer's desk.\n\n "Sorry for my absence, my Führer, but the action report came in later than I expected. I hope you'll forgive the wait." Speidel breathed heavily, finding a seat as soon as he could. It seemed as if he had gotten some exercise in his rush to the office.\n\nSpeer flipped through each folder, searching in vain for numbers. After another few minutes of silence, he sighed and flipped the folders shut. "Forgive me, Herr Speidel, but I can't find the actual report in this mountain of paperwork. Can you give us a run down?"\n\n Speidel grinned- he had done his paperwork, and expected this to happen. "Of course, my Führer. The operation began in earnest at 12:30, concluding at 13:43, though most of the action was finished by 12:42. In this period, 104 revolters were killed, with 187 captured and placed in custody, including all four of their supposed leaders. Wehrmacht casualties were 11 KIA, 24 wounded. Out of the 83 hostages taken, 74 were rescued. Overall, I think it's clear that this was a success."\n\n "Well, hold on there." Schmidt rose to his feet. "Sure, the operation succeeded in its goal, and I'm sure we're all thankful for that. But over a hundred people were still killed- lives that would have been saved if we had negotiated."\n\n "Herr Schmidt, I understand your concern, but I don't think many are weeping for unruly slaves." Speer replied.\n\nSchmidt stared at Speer, ice in his eyes, before sitting back down. The meeting would conclude shortly after."

speerflavor.18.t:0 "The Student Reaction"
speerflavor.18.d:0 "While much of the Reich had been paying at least passive to attention to the drama unfolding in Frankfurt for the last days, none watched more intently or cared as deeply as the students. For the last three days, students in every major university were glued to their phones, waiting for their friends to relay new news from Frankfurt. From there, they would speak to their friends, who would spread it across their dorms. Through this jury-rigged communication line, the students stayed up to date on every movement, every development, every shot. All watched intently for Speer's response- perhaps this was the turning point for him to finally kick up slave retribution to a new level.\n\nTo say that the reports of Wehrmacht storming the factory disappointed and angered the students greatly would be an incredible understatement.\n\nAs the news spread throughout the cities of Germany, so too did the protests. University dorms emptied onto the streets as thousands of enraged students marched on a scale not seen since the chaotic days of '63. Various protest chants filled the air, each different in sound and lyrics, but they each revolved around one theme- betrayal.\n\nThe streets would eventually empty, of course, but the feeling of resentment lingered. Across the Reich, portraits of Speer were silently taken off walls. Posters espousing Speer's ideals slowly disappeared from college campuses. In every campus, the tone of political discourse shifted from idealistic dreaming to bitter disappointment, as once again a leader had betrayed the youth of Germany.\n\nPerhaps it was not as bad as it could have been- a straight invasion of the complex may have driven the students to a riot- but the damage was clear. Speer had let the students down, and never again would they trust him so blindly."

Through the course of this trial, we have heard tales from witness after witness of these slave's brutality. They rose up against the order of things, took arms from the workers of the factory, made hostages of any who dared resist their takeover, and when the time to restore order to the facility came, they brutally murdered numerous brave sons of our Reich! I'm truly saddened that the worst penalty that I can give to these heartless pigs is DEATH, to be executed immediately by firing squad!"\n\nThe crowd roared its approval, and the boos came fast and heavy as soldiers hoisted the slaves to their feet, beginning to drag them down the hall and out of the courthouse. Suddenly, one wriggled free. He pushed past the guards and, in one loud yell, shouted something that silenced the room. It would not be published in the news reports the next day, nor would it stop the crackle of gunfire that occured in the next minutes, yet it stuck with those who heard it long after the other details of the trial faded from their memory. After all, there was only one thing that it could mean, and if the slave spoke the truth, then what would the next years bring?"

"There's a man in a suit- he's talking to the army right now- they're setting up speakers?" Jan looked over to Mykyta in near disbelief.\n\n "Are they negotiating? You can't be serious." Mykyta responded, a similar look in his eyes. The Germans, negotiating with slaves? Untermensch? It didn't happen. Besides, why would they? Mykyta and Jan would never say it aloud, but they knew that, if the Germans really wanted to, they could steamroll any resistance the slaves could put up. Why would they negotiate?\n\n "You must be seeing things. Give me the binoculars." Mykyta snatched the binoculars from Jan's hands, pressing them to his own face. True enough, he watched as the man in the suit argued with a flustered officer. After a few moments, the man in the suit grabbed a microphone and began to stride forward. A stately voice blasted from the speakers, engulfing the factory.\n\n "Good afternoon!" the voice boomed. "My name is Helmut Schmidt, minister of foreign affairs and lead diplomat of the Reich! I have come to discuss terms of surrender, so that none may die on this day. With your co-operation, we can come to terms. Without it, the end result of this affair will be more bloody than either you or I want it to be. If you wish to cooperate, send a sign." With that, the man retreated back to the police cordon.\n\nJan and Mykyta looked at each other again. A mix of disbelief, joy, and relief permeated through each of them.

"And I must tell you that I'm working with limited time and space here. You don't know how hard I needed to work to even get this chance. To release you, after a violent uprising? No, it would never be allowed. I need you to work with me here."\n\n "Then perhaps I will remind you, Herr Schmidt, that we still hold numerous hostages."\n\nThere was silence for a moment, as both parties regarded each other. Though neither side could read the other's mind, both knew that they couldn't afford for the negotiations to fall through. For Schmidt, it could spell the end of his reputation. For the slaves, it could spell the end of their lives. There had to be a compromise somewhere.\n\n A bolt of inspiration struck Schmidt, and he took his chance. "Look. I can't release everyone, but perhaps I can hit a middle ground. My proposal- you and the rest of your leaders surrender, and we try you fairly. The rest of the slaves are freed, along with the hostages. If you take the deal, I promise- none of you will ever see a slave factory from the inside again."\n\nThe slaves looked at each other. Schmidt attempted to hide his distress- were they sharing looks of joy? Agreement? Distaste? He needed a result soon- no doubt that Speer was getting antsy at how long it was taking to strike a deal.\n\nThe two men on the other side of the table looked back to Schmidt. "Herr Schmidt, if what you say is true, we would be happy to accept imprisonment if our comrades go free. I'm sure the other leaders would feel the same."\n\nThe prisoners couldn't see it, but the tension of the last days evaporated from Schmidt's body as he rose to shake their hands."

"Herr Schmidt, I'd prefer to not be looking through these all day. Is it possible for you to give a summary?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "Of course, my Führer. I flew to Frankfurt and engaged in a dialogue with the slave leaders. Over the course of the next days, we spoke to one another at the negotiating table, concluding in an agreement where, in exchange for the freedom of the hostages and the surrender of all arms, the leaders, and the factory, we would let the slaves go free-"\n\n "Hold on." Speer interrupted. "You let all the slaves go free? As in, all of them?"\n\nSchmidt paused for a moment. "Yes, my Führer. It was the only way to a successful deal."\n\nSpeer sighed. "Jesus Christ, the Heer is going to fucking shred me, Schmidt. Do you understand? The conservatives, the militarists, the buisnesses- they're going to fucking shred me."\n\n "My Führer, it was the only way." Schmidt replied, his tone of voice hardening slightly. He attempted to continue, but was again interrupted, this time by Speidel.\n\n "May I interrupt, my Führer?" Speidel questioned. He continued before he got an answer. "While the intentions of Herr Schmidt are certainly in the right place, I fear that we may see a wave of revolt among the slave populace when they learn of our softness on this issue. We need to stay on guard, perhaps raise security on major factories."\n\nNow Schmidt was the one interrupting. "For God's sake, Speidel, are you still going on about this? Your solution would have killed a hundred people, probably more. Sure, there could be some unrest. Does it truly matter if we've saved lives?"\n\n "I'm not saying it was the worst choice- there were certainly worse solutions proposed. All I'm saying is that we need to be on guard."\n\n Schmidt threw his hands up in the air. "My Führer, all of the details are in the folders. I'm sure you can find them for yourself." With that, Schmidt departed, with both the Gang and Speidel following shortly. All that remained in the room were Speer, his thoughts, and the mountain of papers on his desk."

speerflavor.23.d:0 "To our great Führer, Albert Speer\n\nMy Führer, we of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Club for Albert Speer in specific, and the United University Clubs for Albert Speer in general, cannot commend your actions regarding the slave rebellion in Frankfurt higher. Indeed, there was some concern that you would go back on your word regarding the freedom of all slaves when the news was first passed to us. When the news came through that not only had you sent Helmut Schmidt to negotiate with the slaves, but had succeeded in your goals, I can only describe the mood as ecstatic. Indeed, we can certify that in Germania, we held an impromptu rally in your favor that was attended by at least a thousand fellow students. Such rallies were also reported to us by our other chains across Germany. We are so thankful to have a leader who truly is backing up his promises, and we are certain that this chain of action will continue. Know that, no matter what forces try and stop you, we will always be behind your rule.\n\nSincerely, Rudolf Wagner, Head of the United University Clubs for Albert Speer.\n\nTo the Führer, Albert Speer\n\nOne cannot help but look at your recent choice to negotiate with slaves, the bottom tier of German society, with disdain and fear. We in the Heer worry greatly over this recent course of action- is it not true that we Aryans are superior to our slaves? If we treat our slaves like Aryans, then what will the meaning and the power of the word even become? Suffice it to say that many of us in the Heer are more than a little displeased with this recent change in actions. Such foolish measures as negotiating with slaves will only lead to trouble and western corruption in the future, and the notion that this western corruption may be infiltrating even the highest levels of our government is very worrisome for those who love our Reich and what we have built upon it. I can only implore you to change course immediately, before the nation which we all love falls to bolshevism and decadence.\n\nSincerely, Oberst Hans Meyer, Commander of the 2nd Regiment, 36th Division."

speerflavor.24.d:0 ""I told you it would happen, my Führer, and it has. Read the reports for yourself." Speidel dropped a folder, filled with paper, directly onto Speer's desk. Speer took one look at it and, already knowing the contents, sighed deeply. Schmidt watched on, repressing his own anger at Speidel's continued resistance.\n\n "Hamburg- Two guards dead, six slaves dead, a dozen wounded. Danzig- Four guards dead, six slaves dead, another dozen wounded. Munich- 14 guards dead, 25 slaves dead, dozens wounded. The list goes on and on, my Führer." Speidel spoke with the certainty of a man who had memorized these reports. Speer placed his head in his hands as Speidel continued. "It seems clear to me, and many others, that this was a poor course of action to take, and now we are seeing the results."\n\nSchmidt cut in. "Herr Speidel, when will you stop going on about the damn decision? I think it was a net positive."\n\n "Of course you do, you came up with it." Speidel spat. He turned to face Schmidt, who seemed to grow angrier by the second.\n\n "And you say it isn't because we turned your proposal down!" Schmidt pointed at Speidel, who remained unmoved. "We avoided a disaster by negotiating- can you imagine the international response to us gunning down slaves? What about the students and reformists- you think they'd agree with running people over with tanks and cars?"\n\nNow it was Speidel's turn to get angry. "Herr Schmidt, it is your choice, not mine, that has led us into this mess! We would never see slave unrest to this scale if we had not enticed them to do so!"\n\n "ENOUGH!" shouted Speer, his head snapping back up. "What's done is done! There's no use arguing the damn point! If I hear one more argument about what we should or could have done, I'm throwing both of you out of my office!"\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Both Speidel and Schmidt were caught off guard by Speer's outburst, when he usually was the only one to remain calm in these scenarios. Finally, both men exited the office, leaving Speer alone to ponder what could have been, and what his actions would mean for Germany."

speerflavor.25.t:0 "Fresh Blood"
speerflavor.25.d:0 "Antonin Grzywacz was not fit for this kind of work. Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, assembling car part after car part, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip and a pained yell that would always accompany it shortly afterwards. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle that would signify the beginning of their shift was absent. In its stead was a deafening gritty voice that came over the entire factory. In his time of servitude, Antonin had learned German and was practically fluent in it, which made understanding what was being said easy enough. It seemed to be an announcement of some kind, and as he listened in, the fingers grasping the assembly line tightened.\n\n"Workers of the Reich!" The voice exploded. "Listen carefully! On orders of the Führer, today we will begin introducing two things. The first will be an overhaul of the factory. It will chiefly concern an increase in safety protocols," he said, and Antonin cracked a discreet smile. Since when did they care? "While some of you will be receiving advanced training regarding new equipment being brought in. Next! You will be working with a few Germans--" ... What? The- "Who have been designated as being highly disciplined, efficient, and with a strong work ethic." As if the monstrous Aryan knew anything other than bloodshed, Antonin thought, a sudden fit of anger overtaking him. "It will be in your best interest to cooperate with them, else the punishments for acting out on your beastly instincts will be extreme!"\n\n"That is all. Continue working." As the crackle of the voice faded and the whistle signalled the beginning of the day, Antonin saw several men walk into the building. Unmarked. He scowled to himself, but he was no fool. The Germans settled themselves in, but the rest of the day passed with a silence that barely contained the intense murderous aura that surrounded many of the Polish slaves working there. Even Antonin. But he wouldn't succumb. Even in this scum-sucking bottom-of-the-barrel life, opportunity would come. For what, he didn't know, but he knew he couldn't work himself to death in here. Not yet."

speerflavor.26.d:0 "That day, he felt particularly tired. Rubbing his eyes as he passed the checkpoint into the factory, Antonin floated a thought in his head about calling off from work. But, no - this wasn't Poland; they'd only accept a delimbing as an excuse, and even then. With a hiss laced together by a sigh, he noticed that a slight adjustment in workers was made. This happened every few months, of course, but this time luck proved unfavorable towards Antonin. Walking into the factory, he should've expected it sooner or later. But actually seeing the man - not particularly outstanding in any way, not even possessing the desired traits of an Aryan like blonde hair, was a thought running through his mind long enough for him to hear a shout behind him. It was the harsh voice of a factory overseer that grazed his back which called him back to him senses, and with an awkward neck rub, Antonin went to his designated position.\n\nHe was no fan of the Aryan, that much he could say for certain. His dislike of the man next to him plagued his mind. What an insult for a German citizen and a Polish slave to be working side-to-side like this! Antonin's mind drowned out the noise from the outside world as he thought, filling him with frustration about this awful fact. It was only when something akin to a voice came through did his haze stop up and lift. Then he heard it again, more clearly this time. "Hey, ah..." The other man began. Antonin tilted his head to the left slightly, enough to denote that he was hearing, but also continue to stare at his work. "You're Antonin, right? That's how your name was listed." No response. It took several seconds before the German continued. "I'm Gottfried. I've just been thinking... if I'm going to be working here for a while, I might as well-" That's when Antonin decided to turn all the way, giving him a cold glare. "No talking on the job." He said, almost spitting venom. "What sort of 'discipline' do you have to be doing this?"\n\n "I..." The other man began, seemingly wanting to say something. Then he turned back to the assembly line, muttering, "Nevermind, then." The German backing down from a conversation struck Antonin as strange. Why did he even bother to engage in conversation in the first place?! Did he not know who they were, and who he was? He didn't bother to think about it any further. By the time the whistle rattled through his head, all Antonin wanted to do was sleep. Sleep for as long and as heartily as he could."

speerflavor.27.d:0 "He was 49 years old now, and things have changed significantly ever since that announcement two years ago. This transitionary period was marked with relative calm - the incidents where non-Germans would assault Germans was rare, and it only got rarer when rumors spread of what would happen to those that tempted fate towards their overlords. Having spent most of his waking days here, he knew it all inside-out. That's how he also saw, bit by bit, how his fellow Polish workers were being phased out. At the very least he knew this time around where they were going.\n\nGottfried wasn't one of those 'highly disciplined' Germans, he had come to learn, instead being a volunteer for the Reich's program of encouraging them to move into less populated, more diverse cities nearing the edge of the border, rather than staying inside overcrowded metropolises. If only he could visit one of them. But discussing these things with Gottfried served as the second best thing. "So, Antonin," the German began, barely paying attention to the assembly line as he worked. "Have you heard?", "No, Gottfried, I have not." Antonin responded, prompting the man to follow up with: "Führer Speer has decreed Polish slaves-" Antonin winced lightly before glaring at him, whose eyes widened in slight surprise as he nodded. "Ah, um, I'm sorry-- workers will be allowed to, uh, in due time, leave their assigned job and return to the city that they were born in. Or, if they were born in a village, in the city closest to that village."\n\nAntonin almost couldn't believe the words he was saying, causing him to fumble with the car part in his hands for a moment, threatening the gaze of a nearby overseer, before he readjusted and continued. "I'm sorry, Gottfried, but I don't believe your government is so kind to do that. There's always something in it for them." He said, bitterness pouring in near the end. "Well, I suppose that is... true... " The German said, very warily, very hesitantly. "But think about it. What does that mean for the future? Perhaps more liberties would be afforded to you at home?" The thought of such a thing made Antonin chuckle. "Sure, Gottfried. When they eventually kick me, a man nearing fifty, out of the factory, what will they make of me when I return to a city I don't belong in, as a man well past the point of usefulness?" He asked. Gottfried began to open his mouth, but relented. There was nothing more to speak about this topic for today."

speerflavor.28.t:0 "Embers of the Past"
speerflavor.28.d:0 "Antonin's fiftieth birthday was today. These days were no different from any other. Only a reminder that his body would continue to break down and become less useful, and that his mind would dull with the passage of time. For that morning he brought a slightly worn-out coat to work, and passing by the checkpoint, noticed an aura distinctly different to how it usually felt. When he entered the factory, Antonin noticed that all the workers were congregated into a half-circle around a podium in the middle of the room. Fitting into the crowd of half Germans and half Poles, Antonin stared at the collection of what looked like military officers, one standing in front the rest. Subconsciously gritting his teeth at the sight of a proper Nazi, Antonin listened in as the man gave a stiff salute. And then...\n\n"Workers of the Reich! In this case, I am more importantly addressing our Polish slaves." Antonin rolled his eyes. Of course. "The Führer has announced that the Litzmannstadt automobile factory, property of Daimler-Benz, is letting go of all Polish workers who have not been born in Litzmannstadt!" Immediately, the murmuring in the crowd was heavy, but a slamming of rifles against the ground by nearby soldiers shut them - and Anton - up quickly. "Effective today, those in question will be given three days' worth of rations, their documents, including a passport, and one month's work of pay. You will be guided to trains that will head either to German territory, or to the Polish government." Feeling a need to say no more, he gave another stiff salute. "Dismissed!"\n\nAntonin's mind had entered a flurry. Was what Gottfried said that year ago really going to ring true? Was he going to go home? Why now, of all times, and so suddenly?! There was a tightness in his chest as he approached the man he had now known for two years, and for a moment, he had looked at Gottfried as if he was just another German, but it passed just as quickly as it appeared. "Y-you were right..." Antonin began, and his fellow worker nodded silently. "Now I must board a train and head to a city, all in one day. This all has happened so quickly, so suddenly, and..." He trailed off. Gottfried shook his head. "I don't know much, Antonin, but I know that I'll miss talking to you." Antonin looked at the German carefully, swallowing a lump in his throat."

speerflavor.29.d:0 "The wooden flooring made his behind sore, but it's not like he could complain. The train car's door in front of him was open, exposing the endless green that swirled past him. He didn't know what to think. What was there to think? Nothing at all. Indeed, that was what Antonin was going through. He thought of nothing, but his mind hurt as if he had a migraine. Perhaps he was not allowing his mind to think? Yet deep in that hole of nothingness and despair, a thought was extracted. He could notice his breathing becoming more hitched, the scratching of his fingertips against the floor as his hand tightened up.\n\n"I have been here before," the sentence wandered in his mind. Numb and cold, but it held an ingrained sense of impossibly comprehensive fury. "I have been here before," it repeated, begging to be completed. "The rumbling of this engine and the mixing of the colours in front of me. I recognize this all. It's familiar to me, in a way I cannot ever forget." And how could he? If he did, he would lose the last thing that made him a person. Otherwise, he would simply be a shell, hollow and tumbling in the void, waiting to be consumed by reality's cruel whims. "I have been here before. When I was, I never expected to be anywhere else. But I did. Now I have returned."\n\nAntonin was not thinking. How could he think? If he did, it would only open up long-lost memories that he would not dare to look at. Here, in this train, he was alone. Utterly alone. In this car there was nobody else but him-- he had all reason to think, and all the time. But he would prefer to have his mind remain closed. Banishing the flame that threatened to engulf him in his mind, he only stared mindlessly into the fields, all of which blended into the same field, green and endless.\n\nYet even in a lack of thought he hated the chugging of the engine - the bumps in the rail making him stop up his breath as if the ride had ended. Silence dominated his surroundings, but all he could hear was noise that was almost thirty years overdue. He did not feel the pain in his fingertips, nor the fact that everything in his vision blended into shapeless blobs and whirlwinds of color, and the grinding in his mind that lasted for hours, and hours, and hours..."

speerflavor.30.d:0 "He still had a job to do, as he always would, with the main differences being that he was surrounded by men and women of his own blood, all of whom lacked the distinct armband that denoted them as Poles. A symbol of oppression removed - but it meant nothing to him. In fact, it only served to further frustrate him. Every day after he would come home from work, into a small apartment that can barely house one person, Antonin wonders what really would happen now.  Clearly, this was not the end goal that the Germans had intended for him, as Gottfried had implied. But what then? What else was in store for him and his people?.\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle woke him from a daydream and alerted him to work. He was dreaming so often nowadays - was that age, or simply a want to escape reality? Either way, work was monotonous as before, only with somewhat less oversight from the guards, who seemed willing to pounce on any opportunity to harass them. If life had to carry on like this, perhaps it wouldn't be so awful. He had a place to live, and a steady supply of people to talk to, as well as walking around a city freely... even if it was tamed by the Aryan, and moulded in its image.\n\nAt least, those illusions of which lasted until a fellow worker spoke to him. Surprised to hear a voice, he observed who spoke to him - it was a woman, who seemed to be in her 40s. "You," she began, with Antonin listening in only passively. "I can tell that something is off with you. Like a pacified animal, you shamble about and wait to be put down. Is that right?" That caught his attention immediately, and he hissed out: "Are you ridiculous? What are you saying?", "What I am saying is this: I can sense that you are empty, my friend. That you have wanted something which has been kept from you for a long time.", "And what would that be?" He silently struck back, frustration already appearing on his face. "An opportunity," she said, and a small smile graced her lips.\n\n"An... opportunity?" Antonin repeated, the word echoing in his head. Was that not what he was looking for? In all his years of labor, he never once struck a German in fear that he would miss out on an opportunity. And now... ? "To take back what we've deserved for so long. You know as well as I do, don't you?" She asked, as if she was speaking of some long lost artifact. "Say it. That alien word that has been stolen from us for decades."

speerflavor.31.d:0 "Grigory had always carried the hate passed down from his father. There was a spirit in him-- unconquered, unbroken, unwilling to bend to the will of the Aryan scum. But he had nothing to show for it, only working day-by-day to toil himself and serve as a slave to the Germans. If that's all he would be, and remain to be, then it was almost better to simply cease to exist. The thought to grab the nearest metal object and rush a guard crossed his mind, but never in the years he was working there did he carry out that glorious fantasy. Perhaps he was a coward for doing so, and would always remain a coward.\n\nUntil one day, a shrill voice stood tall over him and the rest of the non-Germans present in the factory. He didn't understand much of their language, choosing to almost actively work against learning it, but he had still learnt fragments of it. Enough to learn and piece together one crucial fact: that the first German worker would come work here, beginning that shift.\n\nEven though the silence afterwards spoke for itself, the guards didn't motion for any increased vigilance. Instead, they seemed to show relief that their fellow brethren would work here. Grigory, however, had other ideas. Only minutes afterwards did the first workers began trickling in, and once they did, the light in his eyes had shone in a way previously unknown. He could tell what the sinking yet exciting feeling in his gut was. This was the time, and he could get no other time.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that the guards were lax from the German workers, perhaps the other Russians and Poles and Ukrainians decided to ignore the fact that Grigory seemed to tense up as if he'd seen the murder, and perhaps the German that was approaching him mistook his feelings as fear rather than fury. What was for certain, however, was the chaos that ensued when Grigory grabbed the nearest metal object, screamed in a voice coarse and unused, rage overfilling every inch of his body as he swung harder than he'd ever swung before.\n\nThe sickening crack that echoed through the factory was quickly drowned out by shouts and bootsteps, with the German falling to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut as Grigory unrelentingly continued. It took no less than six men to tear the murderous machine away from the man bleeding profusely on the floor, and only minutes later did silence come over the factory once again.\n\nWhen tomorrow arrived, there was one less slave working in the factory."

He was very tired, and perhaps just a bit tipsy from the liquor he drank to keep himself awake. With a yawn, he turned off the light and looked from the window at the sleeping Germania: how different it was from Hamburg, so big, so strange!\n\nStill thinking about his home, he made to leave the office, but perhaps by chance, he looked at the mirror near the room's entrance, and wished he had never done it. His figure was dark, but a single moonray illuminated the very thing that he didn't want to see: the red band with the swastika, symbol of all members of the NSDAP, including him. Disgust crept from his feet at that cursed thing and at himself for wearing it every. Single. Day. He immediately went to remove it, as if it burned, but stopped when he heard a voice.\n\n"Why are you trying to remove it?" his own reflection told him, sneering in the dark mirror, "You can't lie to yourself, you like it, admit it!"\nAfter a moment of complete befuddlement, he replied, anger flowing from his voice: "I don't! I'm doing it for everyone! To build a better tomorrow! I'm- oh, no... no, no, no!"\n"Liar" the shadows replied as they took shape behind him, a severe visage so similar to him.\n"Fa-father?"\n"Look at what you have done, Helmut" Gustav Ludwig Schmidt said, disappointment heavy in his aged features, "You live among them, smile at them, shake their hands! You betrayed us! You are no son of mine!"\n"I- I'm doing it for-"\n"Liar!" screamed his father, "Liar!" laughed his reflection, "Liar! Liar! Liar!" cried a thousand shadows swirling around him.\n\nWith a loud crash, the mirror went into pieces when Schmidt threw his briefcase at it, and suddenly the spell broke.

Until that time came, the Feldmarschall would have to contend with grimy Russian partisans in the cities and the wilderness.\n\nThat was why he was there, after all. Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner and his brave allies were conveniently carted off to this snowy shithole by the blessing of the magnanimous Führer, where they would serve the Reich by protecting the Eastern Front from whatever insane faction managed to unite Russia. Schörner plucked the cigarette out of his mouth and spat onto the snow. He didn't know whether to be furious or flattered at being granted such an exile.\n\nThe nest of vipers that was Germania could never have prepared him for the disgusting Militärbezirk, where the German and Slav practically skipped through Moskowien hand-in-hand. What was the point in hunting down terrorists, training troops and securing the eastern border if such degeneracy was allowed in the cities? The Feldmarschall shook his head and took another puff. It was only a matter of time before miscegenation was legalized in this territory. Militärbezirk Russland deserved new leadership. Someone with the strength and courage of Schörner, with the loyalty and obedience of Remer, and with the determination displayed by their militarist clique. As for the leadership of the Reich...\n\n Schörner smirked bitterly to himself and threw his cigarette into the snow, where it hissed back at him.

Fighting outwards from the Rhine and towards Germania during the tumultuous civil war taught him a thing or two of how things could so quickly change, and how the New Order can be just as volatile and prone to collapse as any other country. Though... those things did not concern him tonight, as he waited until the clock would turn to a new day, and then he would begin the preparations.\n\nA hundred men was, perhaps, overkill, but it guaranteed the approach he was going for; a swarm of trained soldiers surrounding the facility would let them know that it was pointless to put up a fight. It was... funny, really, he thought - these same methods he despised were now the methods he was actively using to make sure no blood could be spilled, though unlike his superiors, he made sure to consider the fact that the slaves also deserved this protection. With a sigh, he brought up the megaphone near his mouth as he nearly arrived to his destination. It'd been an hour since the operation began, so he was sure everything was in place. Thinking otherwise would make him needlessly worried.\n\nIn front of the large building dominated by lights and action, an armored vehicle bearing the flag of the Reich came driving casually towards the checkpoint. Seeing something like this happen at such a late hour roused suspicion, though the guards made no moves as the vehicle stopped up in front of the facility, and a man stepped out, dressed in the colours of the Heer and bearing a megaphone in one hand. With a click of the device, it came to life, and Abel took a deep breath.\n\n"This is Hauptmann Richard Abel of the Heer speaking. To all personnel guarding this factory, and to all the slaves working in it, this is a declaration of the Reich." The guards seemed confused. "As of tonight, this facility, belonging to IG Farben, has been seized by direct orders of the Führer, and will be transferred over to ownership of the government. Any attempt to fire upon the soldiers we have stationed nearby will be seen as an attack upon government troops, and will be treated with extreme contempt. The security personnel present and off-duty will be relieved of their work here, and are to be escorted out of the building effective immediately." He gave a short pause to see how they would react, and upon seeing the guards freeze up and understand the message, Abel continued. "That is all."

He'd been in that cold, cold place for so long now that the dawn of a new day began to trickle in, sunlight piercing windows and beaming on barely-worked assembly lines and hollow slaves. He should have left an hour ago, he thought.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nThere was no armband, he could tell. Well, one that didn't bear the six-pointed star. They were all gone now, and Hauptmann Richard Abel's stomach sunk. The deeds of twenty years ago finally caught up to Europe, and where was he during that long, long time ago? When the world was on fire and he was a match waiting to be lit and thrown in, he got his opportunity to strike the flame when he, and only he, encountered something that would make or break a soldier under the banner of Aryan superiority. Abel could still remember it, clear as stars in a pitch black sky, his focus on the real world fading as his mind began to wander.\n\nIt was a family of three, a woman and her two children, though he could hardly remember what any of them looked like. They lived under the house of a Ukrainian man, right on the Donbass river. He didn't speak Ukrainian and nor did the man speak German, but something about his desperation when Abel hit the butt of his rifle against the wooden floor caught him off-guard. The begging and pleading that still stuck in his mind made him relent. There, in that house, were no comrades of his back then to just shoot the degenerate Slav. Instead, he was given a choice. Would he do his duty to the Reich? Then he would be congratulated as a Jew-hunter. And what if he left them be? Then he would surely hang as a traitor to the Aryan people. It felt like an eternity before something happened - but eventually, Abel knew the path that he would take.\n\nNow he stood here, surrounded by cigarette smoke, a veteran fighter of Germany, serving for almost twenty years. Things have changed oh-so-much. He wouldn't call his country reborn, no, but the winds of change blew another direction. Yet..."

Its paved roads, its Roman-style boulevards, and its almost grotesque dedication to maintaining a faint link towards a fake, imaginary past. The memories of the slave camp haunted him, not just in mind, but in his body.\n\nHalting the clacking motion of his hands, he stared at his fingers. Slender and thin, bony and almost dry, like teeth gnawing on the typewriter's buttons. He was still fragile. On a whim, he crossed his fingers together and cracked them. The words came back to him.\n\n"Please, live a little." Wessel said. No doubt, he had seen the state of Erich's apartment. Dusty, messy, dirty, and dingy.

He is survived by a wife and two children, who are living in the city of Frankfurt am Main.\n\n"The victim was a clerk who worked near Adolf-Hitler Straße in Germania, in the office of one Donau Steel and Electric Gear Company. His manager was quoted as saying, 'it is a terrible loss for the company. Johann was an essential worker, who had never taken any leave save for when he was sick. My grief and condolences go to his family.'\n\n"This was not the first incident to befall poor Johann Schmidt. According to police sources, he had been stranded in the wilderness of Moskowien during an employer-sponsored work trip for months. He was discovered starving and close to death before the authorities of the Reich found him. More details on page 5...""

 speerflavor.38.t:0 "Briefing"
 speerflavor.38.desc:0 "Holding his pencil between his thumb, middle, and index fingers, Erich played with it. He spun it in his hand, letting its long and slender body insert itself to the various gaps between his fingers. His eyes stared off into the distance, and he paid no attention to the briefing. Erich was the single agent there. The room was plain and dull, but that was understandable. Rows and rows of white, artless, and stark metal desks and chairs - with only one attendant present. A whiteboard with a map of Monowitz was before him.\n\n"Hey, Herr Fischer," the briefing instructor said, annoyed by Fischer's antics, "are you paying any attention?" He was the same as the receptionist in his hotel. Greying, boring bureaucrats in an endless waiting line for something to do. The Reich's Aryan hierarchy seemed to be an environment where men like these could live, thrive even. As opposed to the blond, eternally youthful, and blue-eyed models seen in countless propaganda posters - Erich had seen his share of those. He would tell you that none of it was accurate.\n\n"I've been there," Erich said, "done that. Why don't we make a deal, Herr Instructor." He leaned forward on one hand, putting his pencil down. "You tell me what to do, straight to the point. That way, we can get our jobs done without much more contact with one another."\n\nThat seemed to get some rise out of the man. "Deal, but one condition," he held his index finger up as if to emphasize the point he was making, "I don't hold any responsibilit-"\n\n"I got into the job knowing the risks, sir. I would not be a field agent otherwise."\n\nIgnoring Erich, the man proceeded, "You are to infiltrate the Monowitz slave camps and gather intelligence, as before. With one twist," the man pointed on the map, with pointless irony, "once you're in there, you will be contacted by an RND element within the camps. He will give you the equipment to proceed to your second task. Sabotage the camps and provide suitable conditions for the RND to trigger a slave revolt there."\n\n"Sounds easy enough."\n\n"I appreciate your sarcastic wit. Herr Wessel gives you leeway to choose your moment. When will it be?""

 speerflavor.39.t:0 "A Second Descent to Hell"
 speerflavor.39.desc:0 "Once again, Erich found himself riding the train that would carry him to the depths of hell. He had never seen a carriage packed so full to the brim before. Well - he had. Once upon a time, a few months ago. The scent of sweat had formed a layer of briny smell, sickly sweet, and saltily bitter. Erich had once passed an eternity in here, but thankfully, he had a place to sit this time. Others were not so lucky. Some collapsed under the heat of a hundred bodies pressed together like sardines. Erich knew that some had died.\n\nInside the cramped, damp, and dark atmosphere of the carriage, he drew a picture of Monowitz from memory. There were the pens, the guard barracks, and finally the chemical plant. An eternity would pass, but he held onto the picture like a man clinging to driftwood amid a shipwreck. Soon. Soon.\n\nThe carriage halted, its tires screeching as it entered its port. Its doors slid open with full force, and early morning light poured into the gloom. Those who had survived the journey filed out, carrying whatever their fate had spared them to have. Erich's possessions were not much. Papers and some clothes - just enough to get a skilled laborer permit into the more humane portions of the camp. Not that that was much to speak of.\n\nThe camp's guards assembled them into two groups: one for men, one for women. Then they lined them up, and an officer sorted both ends into skilled and manual labor. Ahead, in Erich's queue, a man dressed in the most opulent uniform possible in this place flicked his fingers. Left. Left. Left. Right. Erich had heard the stories of where the left side had led to. He shuddered. He hoped his papers were enough.\n\nWhen Erich's turn came, the man's fingers flicked. Right. Erich had never breathed a greater sigh of relief. Next were the showers: a comparatively more relaxing place to go to.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Erich's old life had vanished, and only darkness awaited ahead."

 speerflavor.40.t:0 "On the Path to Liberty"
 speerflavor.40.desc:0 "The guards of Monowitz treated skilled slaves with a little more respect than manual ones. For example, Erich did not have to huddle and sleep in pens containing hundreds - thousands even - of slaves. He had a cell of his own. He was supposed to bunk up with nine or more slaves, but his companions never arrived. It was either fate or the RND's intervention. It could be both, really.\n\nFor the first weeks, Erich worked under the alias of one Herr Hermann Dach, a supposed specialist on the operations of the chemical tools they used here. Of course, Erich knew jack about the details of his work. Then again, he would never have been a field agent if not for his expertise in the arts of mimicry.\n\nIG Farben did not go easy on its slaves. Returning to his cell, he threw his body onto the thin slice of mattress they call beds and slept. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he found, served on a platter, an enormous piece of bread. Erich's mouth watered, but its purpose was probably as both a meal and a signal to commence the operation. He tore into it, piece by piece, not wasting anything, not even the crumbs.\n\nAt last, he found a key and a map. Stopping his surfeit of ravenous appetite, he put the rusty iron key to the platter and unfolded the map. It was small, barely the size of Erich's two hands put next to each other. It was enough. Drawing Monowitz's floorplan from memory, he correlated the X on the map with a secluded corner of the yard. He turned the browning, barely consistent piece of paper over to see if he had some more information to work on.\n\n"You have 45 minutes."\n\n ~P\n\nErich made for the prison cell door as quickly as he could."

 speerflavor.41.desc:0 "Erich made it to the yard in less than fifteen minutes. There, he found the place deserted, the eyes of the guards averted from his presence. Erich was, for all intents and purposes, invisible. Sneaking his way through a cordon of armed patrols, he reached his destination. The X mark glowed like a single speck of starlight in the map of Monowitz within his mind. When he reached it, he dug with his hands. The dirt seemed surprisingly loose, crumbling readily to his grasp.\n\nIn a minute, he found a black backpack buried under all those refuse. The RND had not abandoned him. He was relieved. The last time they sent him deep undercover, they did not give him anything. Erich had to perform on-site procurement for practically everything that he had needed. He was in no hurry to extend his stay at Hermann Abs' personal slave labor camp. Unzipping the bag expectantly, he peered to see what treasures lay within.\n\nErich found a tidily folded uniform, closely matching those worn by the demons of this man-made hell. A pistol with a silencer accompanied a belt stacked with a few clips. A bolt cutter was in there as well. In a few seconds, the bag had transformed him from the fortunate but ill Hermann Dach to the most dangerous agent of the RND. A handwritten note at the bottom of the bag said:\n\n"240 minutes."\n\nIt would have to do. Donning the uniform, gun, and equipment, Erich Fischer set out, the best agent the RND has ever had. His destination? The slave pens."

All was quiet, the yards and halls quiet save for a few of Monowitz's staff. It did not mean that Erich could relax, however. His contact had given him time, and it was swiftly passing him by. Erich had to be quick about it: in a camp as large as Monowitz, there was bound to be a lot of slave pens. Sabotaging one might be easy, but dozens of them would prove to be quite the task.\n\nRows upon rows of identical, brown barracks stretched out in front him. Erich had reached his quarry. Before him were shabby figures shambling in the shadows, laden by exhaustion and fatigue. Their silhouettes made pity rise in Erich's heart. After all, he had been here before. His ribs poked out from his uniform - an eternal reminder of what he had undergone in the name of the Reich. \n\nUnpacking his equipment near one of these brown buildings, he set to work. Taking out his bolt cutter, he set out to do his task. Erich looked at his watch. With a little luck and elbow grease, as the Americans say, he'd be all right."

 speerflavor.43.desc:0 "Erich sat down by the broken lock. He had succeeded in his first tasking. Wiping the sweat from his brow, Erich let his rapid breathing settle down, and looked at his watch. There was still time. His contact was good - very good. He did not know how "P" managed to distract the tormentors of this hell long enough to let him do the Gehlen's dirty work. Perhaps whoever behind the notes had once been an intelligence officer themselves. Their work certainly showed prowess and a penchant for executing dangerous gambits with verve and panache.\n\nHis lungs craved the puff of a cigarette. It had been too long. A week? A month, perhaps? Erich's mind had lost any semblance of time that had gone within the camp. From dawn till dusk was work, work, work. These places were not used for labor alone, but also for extermination. \n\nHe did not believe in the racial theories spat out by the Reich's bureaucrats and politicians. If they had spoken the truth, there would be no need for institutions such as these. There was no nobility in slavery. If the Fuhrer had not been paying Erich's paycheck, he, too, can fuck off.\n\nThe time had come for a decision. The briefing had outlined the goals that Erich needed to pursue in his time working within the camp. He could follow that directive, but he could make a run for it - and no one would blame him. With the guards gone, slipping away did not seem hard. Erich looked at his watch. Time was ticking away. It was now or never."

 speerflavor.44.t:0 "The Guard Barracks"
 speerflavor.44.desc:0 "Threading his way through the quiet and still yard to the guard barracks, Erich was struck by the hygiene of the place. Here, the filth that had plagued the workers' residence, skilled or not, was absent. Whoever solitary guard he encountered dressed well, their evil permeating through the clean fabric and cloth they wore. Erich felt out that this place did not belong here: a spot of order and sanitation within the bowels of the most inhumane organ of the Reich.\n\nWhile he stood there, awestruck by the first signs of civilization after months (or was it weeks?) of captivity, a greeting came, from somewhere ahead. "Good evening," someone said, an innocuous phrase that shot tendrils of surprise and shock through Erich's spine. At least he did not look out of place, and his disguise worked. Returning the greeting, he strode out of view as quickly as he could. Erich was not there to test his luck. His next ordeal would require every ounce of subterfuge that he possessed in his bones, and he was not about to waste it to the indiscretion of these people.\n\nThe ammo storage was his objective. P's help with the patrols would not avail him here. He was alone, and the uniform was the thin line that separated him from discovery and danger. His clammy skin clung to it desperately, holding on for dear life. The time had come to test the value of the RND's investment into its equipment."

 speerflavor.45.t:0 "Ammo Cache"
 speerflavor.45.desc:0 "As he had expected, the ammo cache of Monowitz was immune to the influence that the contact had exerted. Here, there was no languor, no lapse in attention on the part of the guards. There was no lack of firearms on the site. The solitary guards that Erich encountered before had handguns, but here, they sported rifles and submachineguns. Above, a sniper perched on a tower beaming with a spotlight, ready to pick off anyone that came near. Erich may have a handgun, some clips, and a steady hand, but frontal assault can only lead to a single end. Death.\n\nStaying out of sources of light, he reconnoitered the ammunition storage. Perhaps more information would help. The guards here would be more discerning than the ones he had passed by on his way here. It would be awkward with the two guards at the front if he saw through his disguise. There was no telling if they would let him go or shoot at him. Erich would need to trust in the RND's preparations to pass undetected. He did not want to trust them, owing to the incident a few months ago, but he would have to, to make it out of there alive.\n\nA third path was open to him, however. He could, instead of following the RND's directives, leave. No one would blame him for his sense of self-preservation; he had completed one of his objectives anyway. So his choices towered over him, as the spotlight came close to highlighting his position. To advance, or withdraw?"

Erich was compromised. He cursed the RND as he thumbed the silenced pistol holstered on his hip. His uniform did not pass muster, and he hoped to the Lord that his gun's firing mechanism would not jam on him. The ammo cache shrunk, as the feasibility of reaching it grew smaller and smaller.\n\nHis first instinct was the make a run for it. A stupid notion. The rifle and submachine gun can nail him at this distance without much effort. He had only one way, one path to survival. Like in the American Westerns he loved so much, his hands must be nimble and his fingers ready on the trigger. He drew his gun and fired.\n\nThe first shot caught the rifle guard on his eye, sending him spasming to the ground, lifeless. The second round found the submachine gunner's heart, halting him on his tracks, as he slowly collapsed to the ground, drowning in a pool of his own blood. Before Erich could revel at the work of his reflexes and skill, however, a gunshot rang out from the tower. A bullet whizzed past his head, kicking up dust and dirt behind him.\n\nFiring whatever ammunition he had left in his pistol at the sniper, Erich broke into a run. Tonight would be a lively night, to say the least."

After all, he had been through hell once, coming close to dying of overwork and starvation. Erich had given them enough, and yet, still, they demand more out of him. If he falsified his reports, no one would know. He would walk free, a man who had attempted his best to accomplish his mission for the Reich and its Fuhrer. He would be a hero.\n\nHe walked towards the entrance of the camp, through the gates where the head guard selected which slave was a skilled worker and which wasn't. If Erich strode out of there, he would never face selection again. Avoiding any source of lights, he dodged patrols and slaves walking and hobbling in the shade. It was miles from here to an RND headquarters, but the walk was worth it. He had done his work. It was time for him to find a life that existed beyond the dangers of his job. Maybe he'll start a family, and finally settle down.\n\nHe smirked, and then laughed, voicelessly, silently. He was free. Free from the manipulations of shadow masters, from the political intrigue that had so often put his life on the line. Erich felt a longing in his lungs, a craving for cigarettes. He saw no reason not to satisfy it."

There were no roadblocks, and the traffic was silky-smooth, uncreased and uninhibited. He parked his truck near the gates of Monowitz, and chose that moment to sleep a bit, missing the cacophony that arises deep from within the slave camp. He did hear the blaring of sirens manifesting as insistent whispers of alarm, but he dismissed it. The guards would handle that\n\nA knock on his window, then silence. Then a thud, again and again. The window breaks with a shattering ring, and a man dressed in shabby guard clothes forced the cabin open. "Out!" he said, "get out!" At first, Leopold intended to resist, but meeting the muzzle of a submachinegun head-on takes a caliber of a man that Leopold wasn't. He dragged Leopold's body out, as the scream of sirens reached a fever pitch, and shouts of alarm seemed to get closer and closer.\n\n"Get down!" Leopold dropped and lied on his stomach, perfectly still. He heard the truck's tires screech, its engines hiss and whine as it shuddered awake. Leopold closed his eyes, and the muzzle flashes seemed to penetrate his eyelids. He felt his ears ring, even though he had covered them with his hands. The noises faded, and silence settled. \n\nLeopold rose to a kneeling position, and said, "Did he get away?""

Erich's guard uniform was now shabby, riddled with close calls, and steeped in his blood. He thought about suicide, the cyanide pill close to his side, residing in his pouch. Whenever he wanted to, he could bite into it, and let the poison work its way into his system.\n\nHe decided that it'd be too easy. Erich gritted his teeth. His fingers traced the contents of the pouch slung on his hip, feeling for boxy magazines that contained bullets for his submachine gun. There was one and only one. His laughter mixed with the oncoming shouts of alarm and the blaring of sirens. Somewhere, someone screams, and eddies of sobbing made his way to this barracks, Erich's bubble of quietness. For the first five minutes, it was tranquil, almost peaceful. Erich did not believe in God; his Catholicism was mostly for show. Yet, he felt an urge to pray, to repent, at the very last second. He shrugged it off.\n\nAs if on a rote habit, Erich unlatched the empty magazine from his MP5K, and loaded a fresh, new one. His hands cocked the firing mechanism, priming the gun.

Erich's memories seized him, and he stopped in his tracks, trying to push it all away.\n\nMonowitz was something personal. Erich had not wanted to go there, not at all. However, he was sure that the RND would not protect him from his enemies or even try to assassinate him. Erich was sure of it. He had accomplished whatever he was sent here to do: to facilitate a slave uprising in the Monowitz camp as best as he could.\n\nYet, he stared at the looming, bulbous chemical plant that threatened to swallow the whole eastern side of the camp. What he had done - sabotaging the locks, and rigging the arms cache to blow - was in the name of necessity. This one was personal. If only he could make it in, Erich's one remaining explosive would ensure that whatever volatile chemicals inside it would burn the plant down.\n\nHe only needed to decide whether or not to do so.

The room was as plain as its contents. A single, rectangular lamp at the center, and a blackboard with the map of the IG Farben's Headquarters before him. He felt a compulsion to review his notes, something new to him. Rifling through the yellow-tinged, neatly-lined pages of his notebook, he read it with a kind of indolent alacrity.\n\n"Any questions," the briefing instructor said, "Herr Fischer?" The man giving him the lay-down was the very picture of Aryan vitality. That is to say, the types that the Reich's racial hierarchy helped survived and flourish. Bureaucrats with nothing to do but to endlessly recount past data and extrapolate into the future, all to no avail. Like lines washed away by the waves. If Erich were to be honest, he hated them.\n\nOn this occasion, however, he found their fastidious, annoying attention to detail useful.  Even idiots with no sense of initiative and foresight could find work in the RND. "Say," he said to the instructor, keeping the tone as level and cool as his head, "can you summarize, briefly, what I am to do here? We both know we need to get back to work quickly, so the sooner the better, sir."\n\n"In brief, what you are sent there to do is to intelligence gathering," the instructor said, pointing pointlessly at the map, "but the risk is incredibly high. If IG Farben were to discover you, the RND has never had you as its employee."\n\n"What kind of intelligence?"\n\n"Account books, implications of customer abuse, violations of the labor laws, that sort of thing."\n\n"Sounds like a dull assignment."\n\n"Oh," the man seemed struck with Erich's cockiness, "I assure you, nothing about this assignment is dull.

It was barely illuminated under the pale moonlight, but the front of the building was fixed with a bright light, showing three guards, all armed with fully-automatic rifles, patrolling and standing guard. It was not as heavy security as Erich expected it to be, but then again, it was merely the entrance. The inside, he was certain, would be far less forgiving.\n\nHe was already fond of nature before, but he was even more fond of it when it allowed him to sneak from the side and crouch towards the front, thanking his training that allowed him to move quietly across the grass. When he got near the entrance, Erich sunk back into the shadows as a guard passed him by, and prayed to whatever deity was watching as he moved out towards were momentarily unoccupied as all three guards were to busy patrolling the street in front to pay attention to the man rapidly walking up the stairs and towards the set of glass doors.\n\nAlready his brow furrowed with sweat as the doors swung open and closed behind him with a silent, but still painful creak. Then his eyes flicked upwards and spotted the outline of a camera on the other side of the room, beginning to turn to where he was. With quick reactions, Erich leaped to the nearest pillar and dragged himself down it before sitting on his behind, letting out a sigh of relief. Already, he risked failure.

Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, Erich managed to slip past both of them as he went up the stairs and climbed to the second floor of the building. The first, he knew, would not provide anything to him. The second, however, had the possibility of giving incriminating evidence. At least, that's what he was told. Opening a door, Erich listened in before moving into an empty office cubicle, getting down under the desk as his ears perked up. He wasn't alone in this place. There were more guards here. Two more, judging by the footsteps of one farther ahead and the talking of one closer to him. He let a minute pass before he moved out.\n\nErich knew that he wouldn't find anything in these cubicles, so he had to search for an office. When he crossed the short hallway separating one set of cubicles from another, he felt his chest tighten as one of the guards rounded the corner to the hallway he had left moments before. Had Erich been a second slower, he would've been caught. Circling around the large room, he spotted a few more rooms to the side, but one caught his interest.\n\nWaiting until the footsteps turned stiff and then turned silent off in the distance, Erich pushed open the glass door and read the nameplate that was on the desk.\n\n'RHINELAND REGIONAL OVERSEER'."

The RND promised him that some cameras in the building would've been sabotaged - rolling the same footage throughout the night, as an example, which would give him infinite breathing room. They had even been so kind as to mark out which cameras were sabotaged, and which were not. All Erich hoped for was the Reich was wise enough to not underfund the agency's equipment. Oh, how he hoped.\n\nThe things he discovered during his tenur in the overseer's office was... quite interesting, to say the least. For everything related to the Rhineland, practically the industrial metropolis of the Reich, the numbers purported in several of the documents that Erich looked over... did not align with what IG Farben reported. In essence, what were lucrative trade deals and massive investments coupled with generous loans and promises of high quality products were all much less than expected. Such ideas would dig heavily into IG Farben's budget, but promising them would mean an injection of funds from the government, and an increase in business dealings.\n\nNot bad, Erich thought. They were effectively ripping off millions, and these papers could potentially mean at least a partial incrimination of IG Farben's staff. The question, however, remained.\n\nWas this enough?"

It wasn't Hitler's empire, but... the flicker of good came in steps at a time.\n\nThe moment Erich stepped out of the office, however, he heard something that nearly shot his heart from his chest. A loud, piercing noise that went from ear to ear, and then a shout. The RND failed to do what they were meant to do.\n\n"ALARM!"\n\nErich had to act fast. Any moment of hesitation and he would've been dead. Drawing his silenced pistol, he rushed towards the exit of the room and narrowly avoided one of the guards passing him by. They didn't hear his own footsteps while the alarm blared, it seemed. When Erich looked down the half-spiral staircase down to the lobby, however, he spotted bad news.\n\nTwo guards from the outside made their ways in, and both split paths up either set of stairs. Quickly, Erich huddled himself into the corner, pressing his body against himself as tightly as he could, and waited for the booted footsteps of a man with killing intent to pass by him and into the room he had just left.\n\nBrimming with sweat, he practically flew out of the exit, spotting a guard on the outside that was approaching the building. With a quiet shot that rang out in the night, the man yelled and fell over, bleeding from a leg as Erich made a mad dash into the trees that surrounded the building."

Erich had to move up further, and things wouldn't get easier from there. When he sneaked out of the overseer's office, he made his way to the nearest stairway, and spotted a guard standing like a stone statue near it. He was stuck from moving forward, and he had to act quickly, because the guard on the other side would be making his rounds to here, too - then he would be pincered.\n\nTravelling to a nearby cubicle, Erich spotted a book that hung off of the edge of the desk. It was a thick book, and Erich took a deep breath as he pressed down and heard it slam to the floor with a loud thud. Quicker than the footsteps he heard approaching, Erich returned and hid under the nearby desk, covered in darkness as he saw a pair of legs move past him.\n\nWith a deep breath, he moved his way out and practically rushed to the stairway, silently climbing up the steps and into the third floor. Here there were four guards, he could tell, and once again it was his job to find what he needed on this floor. Then, as he made his way to the right, he spotted it. A crown jewel."

Wasting no time, he hurried his way over to the office before any of the guards had a say in his actions, and made sure to neatly close the door behind him as he saw yet another camera flick back and forth. He put a lot of trust into the RND. Perhaps too much. With a sigh, he began to flip between pages, records, drawers, and the many other things in this office.\n\nEntire minutes passed. He was slowed down heavily by the constant footsteps outside, as he refused to risk entry by means of them hearing the noise inside. Eventually, however, Erich found out a strong curiosity that overshadowed what he had found a floor lower. Records that spoke about Abs' transactions; he was a rich man, perhaps the richest man on the globe, and Erich had a feeling that not all of his wealth was legitimate. Where Abs was supposed to pay the government hefty sums in taxes, he had found loopholes and falsified statements about his income, effectively slashing the money he had to pay to niceties.\n\nErich greedily took the documents with him, adding them to the collection of what he had already gathered previous. With these, he could make for a strong case against IG Farben, and for all intents and purposes, he had done more than enough. He had all the reason in the world to leave, but one piece of information still eluded him. The personal office of Hermann Josef Abs. Would he take the risk, bringing him into almost certain death, or would he remain content with what he had taken, and to return to the RND as capable and clever? As Erich opened the door, he made his decision."

He was wide awake, and his senses on the ready. As he passed cubicle by cubicle, the sound of footsteps drew closer and closer, and Erich knew that more time spent waiting was more time for gaps of error to show. He had to act decisively, and he took a risk by looking out towards the hallway nearby to see if anyone was walking down, and there was. Moving back, he was thankful the guards were tired, as it seemed like that guard didn't notice him poking his head out. When he passed, Erich moved.\n\nThere was another door that he slipped by, and then a set of stairs. Dim, blue light and colorless concrete stairs were his only ally as he made his way up, passing by the fifth floor and then the sixth. Before he reached the seventh, however, there was a sudden conundrum. He heard more footsteps - this time coming from above him. Erich's mind was thrown into a panic for a moment, but he readjusted himself. He was expecting another person, but the guard was not. And so he got up the steps, standing right at the edge, when the guard rounded the corner. Right into Erich's grasp.\n\nWith a lunge, he wrapped his arms around the guard's neck and threw him to the guard, keeping him restrained with what the agency taught him, and using every muscle in his body that the RND forced him to develop. It wasn't difficult to overpower the man, and, after almost ten seconds, he felt him lose consciousness. Dragging his body to a corner, Erich continued moving upwards, knowing he was on a time limit that would kill him if it ran out. When he finally looked through the door into the large expanse, he saw it, and something more."

As Erich stepped out, however, he was greeted by something he well and truly dreaded in the back of his mind. The shrill noise of an alarm blared throughout the floor, and voices reverberated from the cubicles and hallways to him. "ALARM!" Was what Erich heard, and he felt a hint of betrayal. The damn RND said that the camera in the accountant's office was sabotaged, and he knew he hadn't been spotted by any of the guards. The ticking timer now turned into a bomb fuse, and Erich had only one way out.\n\nSlamming open the door with his elbow, he quickly made his way down the staircase, but encountered unpleasant resistance along the way. Fortunately, Erich shot first, and the guard only managed to fire one off-balanced shot that pained his ears as he fell on the ground. That would've attracted everyone else, he thought, and it did nothing to ease his worries.\n\nErich began to continue moving down the staircase - he would go to the first floor and pass through the doors in the lobby to the outside, he thought. Then he heard the door of the second floor creak behind him as he was halfway down, and Erich knew he only had moments to respond. As he turned around, however, he felt an immense pain in his chest, and, before he could see who the perpetrator of the shot was, his vision went dark."

Maximum security was to be employed, and maximum response, too. Instead, he listened in and observed. From here, he could see Abs' office clearly, and the inside was lavish. Paintings hung from the wall he could see, and while he was no art collector, Erich had a feeling they were quite valuable. Elsewhere, Hermann Josef Abs himself was present, talking kindly to two other figures. The first was Friedrich Flick, and the other was Edmund Geileberg.\n\nWith a puff of his cigar, Abs grinned. "Not to worry, dear friends. Speer and his pitiful Gang may think of us enemies, but we have influence abound. So long as we remain cooperative, things will go our way. As they had under the previous Führer." Geilenberg took in his words and spoke nothing, while Flick merely raised an eyebrow. "So certain of that?" He asked, and Abs shrugged. "I wouldn't trust these resources that we have pooled as of right now. I have some... connections that I can pull. Most importantly, extremely efficient and highly drilled troops that could do a variety of tasks. Defending, attacking..."\n\n"You mean to tell me you've hired a mercenary company?" Abs cut in, blowing smoke as he kept his smile. Flick looked puzzled for a second. "Well, they're not exactly a mercenary company-" Abs merely patted him on his shoulder, speaking with a cigar between his teeth. "We won't need any of those 'mercenaries' of yours, Herr Flick. We have our own, but thank you for the offer."\n\nIt was time for Erich to choose. In just a few seconds, he had to formulate a plan of action. To get in, get out, and get the hell out of the building. They were blocking the way, so he had to find some measure to dispose of them. And not only that, but the many guards patrolling the area would make it almost impossible to sneak in. Let alone the cameras. Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

Wessel's voice came out like a news reporter would speak from a teleprompter, yet Erich could still feel the pride in it as he stood tall, looking towards the agents in their seats who stared at him with glimpses of respect and awe, though nothing further.\n\nHis mind wandered back to the previous nights when he had finally returned to the agency. With everything and more accomplished, Erich was dispatched to meet personally with Gerhard Wessel. That night was one of the stranger nights he had experienced, dealing with a man who showed little emotion and was known as being ruthlessly efficient. Yet when he had handed over what he had found, the man was surprised, shocked and - dare he think it - amazed. They discussed in length everything that was discovered, and, by the end of the night, Erich was promised a reward.\n\n"To Agent Erich Fischer, for his outstanding bravery and skill, will be rewarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves." The clapping began unanimously as Erich shuffled slightly and waited for Wessel to walk over and pin the medal to his shirt. He was no fan of the Iron Cross, and practically disgusted by the swastika embedded into it, but a medal was a medal, and he didn't think of Wessel to care much about the Nazi machine. This victory wasn't of Hitler's cronies and successors. Not of Speer's. It was the success of him, his agency, and the people that would have easier lives when IG Farben was gone.\n\nWhen Wessel pinned the medal, he gave the slightest nod to Erich, who returned it in kind. The ceremony did not last long afterwards, and eventually the agents dispersed to continue their work. The RND was not a place to lounge around, after all. And neither was it in Erich's spirit.

 speerflavor.65.t:0 "An Architect's Blues"
 speerflavor.65.desc:0 "Another day, another cartload of problems... In his office at the center of the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer, Führer of the German people, is tired; tired and stressed. Even after the war's end, there's no rest: the reconstruction is proving more difficult than predicted, and the party bureaucracy is already starting to resist the changes suggested by the Gang of Four. Like the proverbial clay pot, Speer feels powerless to act, a small raft engulfed by the stormy sea. Taken by the sudden need to escape, he stands from his chair and goes to the window: perhaps it will do him some good to gaze at the great Germania he himself designed?\n\nLooking outside, a wave of memories surges from Speer's mind, snippets of a life that was a mere decade ago, and yet feels as if it was another geological era: showing Hitler the progress made as the two friends laugh heartily, visiting construction sites, directing the workforce, and finally the Volkshalle's inauguration, the crowning moment of his life as an architect. It was a different age, one where the future looked glorious, not this... maddening quagmire.\n\nThe more he looks at what he built, however, the more a feeling of dread creeps over him: why is that building over there still unfinished? Why is that apartment block so bare, the slots for the decorations are all empty! More than anything, who is that incompetent who used low-quality stone for the walkways?! They are already full of cracks! As he finds more and more critiques, he also feels something else, a need he had not felt in years: he wants to correct those mistakes, to make them right, but even more, he wants something... new. His hands itch with the need to design, to give tangible form to the things in his mind! How wonderful it would feel to be once more, even if just for a moment, Speer the architect! However, what is an architect without his tools?"

 speerflavor.66.t:0 "Back to Work!"

In the Führer's office, there's still someone working for the good of the German people, or at least this is what the headlines will report, because putting a sign on the door saying "Architekt bei der Arbeit, Zugang verboten" would be a bit misleading...\n\nWith his work completed, the Führer can finally punch out, and let the architect take his place. Speer clears his desk and takes his tools out of the case he had brought from his home: they are old, but they still work, just like him, and that's more than enough! He has awaited this moment for the entire day, and as he looks at the large, empty sheet, he feels like a painter staring at a blank canvas, ready to fill it with his art: all kinds of ideas swim through his mind, from tall, bold skyscrapers to simple houses and small villas. With a trembling hand, he takes up ruler and pencil, and draws the first line.\n\nThe first sheet goes straight to the dustbin, followed by the second and the third. Trembling lines and small blunders irk the perfectionist inside Speer, but more than five years of inaction require some time to catch up. The fourth sheet, however, survives the initial scrutiny: in the end, he has settled on a public office, a classic of his old practise. As the jumbling mess of lines seemingly drawn randomly acquires purpose, and forms itself into the skeleton of a building, a smile creeps itself on Speer's lips: he is finally free from the stress, from the obligations, from the quagmire, doing what he loves!\n\nAfter a while, the architect stretches his arms and looks at his work. The essential frame, the easiest part, is done, now it's time to start the real work! He looks at his watch, and jumps: it's already past midnight! Best going to sleep, or tomorrow work will be a pain... As he goes home, however, he can't help but wonder: will his newest design ever become reality, or will it remain a small closet dream, one to be put in a museum after his death?"

Now, all it remains is the façade, and this is where the true challenge begins.\n\nWith a sigh, Speer realizes that he never bothered resuming his theoretical studies after he became entangled in the Rechtspolitik - trying to survive in a world where most of your "colleagues" want to kill you is, after all, quite the demanding task - and now he curses himself for not having updated his knowledge. How is he supposed to finish his new masterwork? What will be the final stroke on the canvas?\n\nLooking outside for inspiration, he sees once more his greatest success... with all its flaws and mistakes. Would it be best to follow in his own footsteps, and use the style that forged Germania into what it is now? To act as if nothing changed in the last ten years? For a moment, he thinks of the new, grand structures built in the United States, with their new lines and glass walls: is the future the way forward? To fully let go of the past and find a new beginning?\n\nWith a last look to the Volkshalle, a final thought enters his mind: what if a third way is indeed possible? A fusion of old and new, of past knowledge and future design, a melting pot where both ideals would have to make a small sacrifice for the sake of art... As the Führer-Architekt takes pencil and ruler once more, he has made his decision."

With passion, he starts designing the grand façade: it will be a tall, large entrance way with stone walls and columns reminiscing of the Roman temples he so highly admired in his youth, with a staircase leading to the door. Who needs steel and glass, the strength and raw solidity of stone are enough to impress the viewer, just as it did ever since mankind learnt how to sculpt it into the shapes it desired!\n\nOf course, a public building required to always remind those who entered it of its function. The central pediment will sport a single, giant swastika overlooking the entrance, and atop the pediment a tall eagle will spread its wings over the German people, just as the Vaterland spread across the globe in the wake of its victories. Eagle's heads would regularly jut out of the walls, holding banners or other symbols of national socialism, praising the strength of the German nation and its many virtues.\n\nWith the finishing touches done, the architect looks at his masterpiece with satisfaction. He hasn't yet lost his touch after all! Finally standing and stretching his arms, he takes a last look to the great Germania, and finally, he sees it for what it is, his greatest success, perfect as it is! There is no conflict between architect and Führer, for both shall bring the Reich to new heights of power and prominence, as it was before, and as it ever shall be!"

His ideals, his beliefs, his convictions are still there, they aren't gone, but he can see with his eyes how the first attempt at their implementation has gone: just like Germania, the Reich is a rotting corpse, and it will take a shock therapy to bring it back to life. One day, Germany will be once more at the forefront - no, it will be at the top - but only after sweeping changes have been accomplished. How can a small architect like himself change the tide with a pencil and a ruler?\n\nSlowly, his design starts to reflect his state of mind: the façade is clean, sharply cut, large glass window framed by black steel architraves, everything in stark contrast to the stone walls and colonnades of his own Reichskanzlei. As his building takes a shape so different from everything he has ever done, he feels a slight insecurity, like a child leaving his mother's embrace to swim on his own for the first time: he's leaving behind his old work, to create something he never thought to create, in a shape he never thought to give, so different from his initial plans; and yet, he knows this is what needs to be done.\n\nAs another evening turns into night, the architect finishes his work. With a last look to his old creations outside the window, and to his newest addition on his desk, Speer understands with painful clarity that he can no longer return to his old art: so much has changed in so little time, so much to learn, so much that he has forgotten. In his sadness, however, there's the seedling to a new relief: he's not done yet, there's one last thing he needs to do before putting his tools to rest.\n\nThe Reich will be born anew, a shining beacon of modernity! Perhaps it won't be the same Germany he had dreamt about in his youth, perhaps such a dream was never supposed to turn into reality, but he'll fight for his nation nonetheless, as he has always done."

 speerflavor.70.t:0 "Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis!"
 speerflavor.70.desc:0 "As Speer reflects upon his choice, suddenly the truth dawns upon him. Didn't the Romans take the arch from the Etruscans? The columns from the Greeks? Didn't they study the Egyptians and their stylized forms? Yes. Did this make them any less Romans? No! On the contrary, they grew with everything they learnt, every new notion, concept, technique they absorbed! They didn't accept passively the foreign influences, but neither did they remain closed in their own little world: they assimilated all following their own criteria, everything put into the perfect place for it to shine brightest!\n\nThe solution, the breakthrough Speer needed is there! The architect resumes his work, his mind a melting pot. Slim, graceful stone columns hiding the steel inside them, just like his new Germany. Beautiful and proud, a steel gauntlet inside a velvet glove. The glass would take new forms, curved and elegant, fitting into the façade's fronton and reflecting the light into a majestic eagle holding the laurel of victory. A rainbow of colors, mitigated by the pure white of the stone, would marvel the visitors without scaring them, a comforting feeling of brightness and warmth.\n\nAs the first rays of morning relieve his tired eyes, the architect-turned-Führer can't help feeling satisfied. This time, perhaps the first in his entire life, he has created something entirely new: a new style, a new fashion! Perhaps it will never take foot, but it doesn't matter: an artist works for himself first and foremost, and he finally understands that he is, indeed, still an artist. Now, a new work awaits him, his masterwork, the coronation of his craft: to rebuild the Reich! To rebuild it into what it was always meant to be, a nation fully capable of embracing future without forgetting the past! As the cleaning staff opens the door and jumps seeing the Führer still inside, Speer greets them with a wide grin: this is a great day for Germany, the first of many to come!

They had cast their die and crossed their Rubicon. Now they were not merely protesting, but also clashing with the police. In the streets of Germany, cameras rolled by state-controlled and underground journalists showing the mass panic that rippled through the cities, and the brutality exchanged between police and the rioters-turned-revolutionaries, stoked the growing fear across the nation. It was not received well by the public at large, but Speer received it worse. The slaves - and everyone else associated with them - needed to know their place.\n\nHe did not consult the Gang to make his decision. He had no need to - the next time he held his speech in the cold, dim Volkshalle, he made it clear. The streets would be filled with officers armed with guns. Live ammunition or otherwise. Silence dominated with the occasional approval from those who listened to him, and he met the Gang with cold silence - especially Schmidt, the brazen rat he had no patience dealing with. He knew what he'd say, and he didn't want to hear it.\n\nFor as many concessions as he gave to the pitiful reformist elements that backed him up for so long, he knew he could not disappoint his mentor by giving in to their every demand.

All they knew was chaos and panic, and here they were, burning down one of his most prized constructions. There were so, so many memories in that place. Glory echoed its field, but now it was empty; and did anything good come of it?\n\nPerhaps one thing. Speer's realization that these fools could not be dealt with in peace. He had given them a chance to take the olive branch, and they merely spit on his hand. Now he was in his office - and here stood a member of the Gang. "Minister of War, Henning von Tresckow." Speer coldly called, and Tresckow stood tall, unflinching, gazing at the Führer with an emotionless stare. "The Minister of the Interior is busy, so I'll pass this responsibility onto you. This revolt has gone too far. These madmen must learn what martial law is like."\n\nTresckow shifted uncomfortably. "Herr Speer, I-" Not a second more did he continue when Speer cut in, quickly and harshly. "That was an order, Henning von Tresckow, and you WILL listen to it. The time for playing games with your liberal demands is over. Germany burns, and I will destroy this alliance before I let this horde burn the rest down like the barbarians pillaged Rome. So I advise you to listen." He couldn't see it, but Tresckow's hands behind his back were clutching against each other tightly, and his finely-cut nails scraped against his skin in anxiety. "Alright, then." He said, giving a short nod. "Is there anything else you want me to do?"\n\nWas Speer looking at him or through him? He couldn't tell. "No, Herr Tresckow. I want you to focus all of your attention on this. They will learn the values of violence and discipline. The whip will crack, and..." Speer's fists trembled. "They will learn. As a Prussian, I'm certain you agree." Tresckow's face said anything but. "Now go. You are dismissed.""

He didn't have to read them, of course, he knew exactly what direction this revolt would go. They would push and push, and the Wehrmacht would push back, until finally, the Aryan heel would stomp down and annihilate the petty resistance the revolt gave to submitting to the New Order. The thought soothed his mind a little, but he was still bitter with anger, and a certain someone kept trying to push him down another road.\n\n"My Führer-" Schmidt began, and Speer took no chances, slamming a fist against the desk and glaring at him with rageful, tired eyes.\n\n"This nonsense AGAIN?!" He said, stirring himself into anger. "Helmut Schmidt, know your place. I've spent the past two decades trying to move past web after web, and now you're constantly biting at my ankles, here and there. Who do you think I am, Schmidt? Some sort of peace-loving liberal scum? Perhaps you are, but I am far from such a thing."\n\nSchmidt ground his teeth together, feeling his breathing become heavier. "I've advised you, time and time again, that clashing with the slaves would ruin our international image!"\n\n"To hell with our international image! You..." Speer's eyes narrowed towards Schmidt. "You... lying in bed with the Reichsbanner, aren't you?" Schmidt felt his stomach churn, and he stepped away. "I should have seen this earlier. I should've realized a decade ago. You are more than just some pathetic liberal. I know who you are now, Schmidt - you are a rat! A RAT!" Speer kicked back his chair and stood up, almost frothing at the mouth. "Get out of my office! Get out, you Judeo-Bolshevik bastard! Get out before I have you hanged as an enemy of the state!" Schmidt felt sweat drip down his back as he began walking out, while Speer didn't relent."

Then the tremors returned, and Speer raised his head to look up at the maps on his desk. Here was Germany, powerful and strong, a population of more than a hundred million, built on success after success, and with his guiding hand would steer it into the future. In the east, it was all stripes and circles. The slaves. The whelps. The untermenschen. They had taken so much territory now, and again and again his Aryan people failed him. He would not allow it. No, no, no, no, no. The Führer was no longer Adolf Hitler - it was Albert Speer. He held the power now. He called the shots. All he had to do was make the call. Make the call... make the call...\n\nMake the call.\n\nPapers and office equipment clattered to the floor, and Speer slammed open a drawer, pulling a pen out. The map of Europe remained, and he began scribbling it. Just like when he was back with Hitler, when strategies would be described. He punctured holes into the map to signify where the tanks would blitz. He scribbled across whole areas that would be carpet bombed. Oh, they would learn their place. By gun, bullet, fire, tank. He didn't care what the rest of the world thought. Germany was the master of the world, and everyone else would bend the knee. "And him..." He muttered, voice grazing against his throat with hoarse pain. His eyes flicked to Germany.\n\nSpeer let out a short, raw chuckle. "Helmut Schmidt. You, you Jew. You Zionist little puppet. How I'll see you hang.. m-maybe I'll..." He reached in a hand and barely wrapped his fingers around the grip as he pulled the pistol out, and it clattered weakly on the table. "Yes... yes, that's what I'll do. I don't need to sign papers. I'll just do it myself!" He laughed harder this time, and he furiously drew on the map, a line here, a circle there. "There will be a million dead Untermenschen before they take an inch of Germany!""

Ever since Speer fantasized about returning to his roots as the dictator of Germany, he was scared. What if it went wrong? What if he was stopped? So he anxiously waited for something - and that something came.\n\nWhen Albert Speer received the news that Willy Brandt was now in support of the slave revolt, his mind went into a white haze of rage. Without thinking, he tore the classified document in half, and reached for his gun. He knew where Helmut Schmidt was, and within minutes he knew the Jew would be dead. If only Speer had the patience to give him something worse.\n\nStorming out of his office, he began walking directly to Schmidt's office with only one thing on his mind, but something stopped him. In the dim shadows of the Reichskanzlei he could hear footsteps behind him. Before he could turn around, pain shot through his arms as hands grabbed on tightly, and in front of him walked Reinhard Gehlen. "What the hell are you doing, Gehlen?!" He screamed. "No... you know, you know! What do you know?!"\n\nGehlen gave a small smile as he recovered a thick document and a lighter in each hand. "My Führer." There was no weight to that word. "I have an...interest in keeping things as is. Here," he said, wiggling the document mockingly in his hand, "is a list of all the terrible things you did during your tenure as Minister of Armaments and War Production. Here," he continued, flicking the lighter open near the paper, "is your freedom. Choose wisely, Herr Speer. One will end you. The other will free you."\n\nSpeer could barely see anything past unfocused shapes, but he could hear crisply what the man said. His strength failed him as he attempted to break free. "He set you up, didn't you?" He asked, and Gehlen raised an eyebrow. "Schmidt - he did it, he brought you here, he knew what'd happen, didn't he? Didn't he?!" Fury filled his cracking voice, and all he could think about was how Schmidt would look with a bullet in his brain. "Schmidt!" His lungs pained him. "Schmidt!" Gehlen merely shook his head with disappointment. "SCHMIDT! YOU DEGENERATE SCUMBAG! COME OUT, COME OUT SO I CAN KILL YOU! SCHMIDT!""

Sometimes that woman who talked to him in the factory visited here and there, and they talked. They would talk about current things happening, and she was like a source of information. He learned things outside of his simple life - how the world was in turmoil, how Germany was making this sweeping change and passing this outstanding law.\n\nHow they were still treacherous bastards, and how things would never remain the same, and how day-by-day, things only grew tenser.\n\nAntonin knew it would happen. In fact, he was waiting for it. When he received a pair of knocks on his door, he closed the book in his hands that was about the great Slavic migration into eastern Europe, and unbolted the chain, letting it open slightly so that he could look outside. "Yes?" His old, unused voice asked, and he could see it.\n\nTwo men in uniforms-- and the sign of the Polish Home Army. "Greetings, Antonin Grzywacz. We're here on behalf of the Free Europe army." In his hands he held a rifle that harkened back to old times. "Will you fight, sir?" The man's face was hard, but sympathetic. "There will be no work for you tomorrow." Antonin knew that well. "But I can understand it if you wish to remain here."\n\nSlowly, Antonin unbolted the door complete, and let it open wide. He was old, perhaps even frail, but... Antonin shook his head. "No, son," he began, holding his hands out. The soldier nodded, and handed him the rifle. "I can still fight. Er..." He looked down, then back up. "Before we go, can I ask you a question?" The soldier took no time to respond, even sounding a little enthusiastic. "Of course.""

 speerflavor.77.desc:0 "Where had he gone in these last fifty-something years in his life? What did Antonin make of it? He was a young boy in Poland... oh, how lovely the fields were all up until the point where they weren't. He grew from a boy into a teenager and from a teenager into a man, and he had settled down with a beautiful girl he knew from across his home - and they had raised three children, one who was just a bit slow but it didn't matter to him nor to her and it never bothered the child's siblings. They had all been beautiful.\n\nHad been beautiful. Then, for the past twenty years, Antonin was a hollow man. The Nazis had taken everything from him, grinding his family into dust and ashes and only spitting him out, untainted yet broken. How he longed for death and for the relentless pain in his mind that followed him day after day. Then things had begun changing. Finally, perhaps, the German was showing mercy. Something else that wasn't sheer cruelty, monstrosity, bloodshed. He had met a man who sparked the flame known as friendship with him, and he was a German. What was his name... he couldn't remember.\n\nThen, one day, they had finally given him his freedom. And at home he met another woman. Her name was Anna, and she was fierce, perhaps a bit younger than him but he had been working up the courage to ask her to go on a date with him. Now he laughed about it, and then drew in a sharp breath. The bullet lodged in his stomach made his body numb and his sight fuzzy, and God how he had hoped that some Nazi would have walked in and put him out of his misery or that some tank rolled over him, or an artillery shell blowing his body into pieces.\n\nNo such thing. No such thing - and no help would ever come. He was abandoned by the frontline, and it had long since moved past him. Long into the night, when his consciousness began fading, Antonin cried. For as much as he wished for death, he was truly afraid of it. He didn't want to let go, even if the pain was overbearing, but reality caught up to him. By the time the sun rose, Antonin was dead."

Many thoughts coursed through his head, but as he glanced between him and Anna, he swallowed back the anxiety. The messenger, meanwhile, glowed with positivity. "Good news! Everyone, listen closely. Th-the Reichsbanner managed to haggle with the Germans - we get to go home!"\n\n"What?!" Shouted Antonin, and the messenger seemed ecstatic. "We get to go HOME!" Instantly, cheers from Antonin's squad erupted, and infected the partisans that were in the nearby buildings. His confused expression quickly shifted into a joyous grin, and he went to hug Anna, who gladly accepted it. "We get to go home, Anna," he muttered. "W-we can finally rest. Oh my God, I've been waiting so long for this..."\n\n"And I've still yet to see you fire your gun," Anna replied, giving a short, happy chuckle, and they hugged each-other tighter before letting go. "I asked if you'd join the resistance back then, and here you are now, a freedom fighter who's gained his freedom without firing a single shot." Her expression sombered, though her smile remained. "Antonin..." She trailed off, as she could notice that he had an anxious look on his face. "What's wrong?" Antonin rubbed the back of his neck and smiled awkwardly. "S-see, Anna, I... I'm... a widower, to put it bluntly, and I..." Anna's eyes widened. "I have no ring, but I'm sure I can buy one eventually. Will you-"\n\nAnna leaped in and wrapped her arms around Antonin, and he could feel his eyes swell with tears. "Yes, Antonin, I will. I will."

 #Science chain

 
 speerflavor.79.t:0 "Die Deutsche-Physik"
 speerflavor.79.desc:0 "As any good German should know, Mein Kampf teaches that the tendrils of Judaism are deeply rooted in the entire world: fearing open confrontation with the master Aryan race, the despicable lot tries to gain the upper hand through cunning and guile. Jewish personalities are embedded in all sectors of society: from banks to industry to science, the amount of people openly or covertly swearing their allegiance to the six-pointed star of David and Judas is staggering.\n\nAs such, it's only natural that the relatively new field of Physics would immediately be infected by such a plague. From Albert Einstein to Enrico Fermi, the false doctrine of Jüdische Physik has tried to subvert science from the inside, spreading false beliefs on how the very fabric of the world was structured. It was only a matter of time before the true Aryans would try to cleanse universities and scientific institutes from this filth, and replace it with the true science, the Aryan science!\n\nFrom this cauldron of national pride and racial superiority was Deutsche-Physik born, a titanic effort aimed at replacing the decadent and corrupt Jüdische Physik with a doctrine that truly answered the great questions of our time. However, National Socialism wasn't alone in his quest for truth, and many had already tried, even on their own, to refute such false beliefs on the ground of Aryan rationality. From Hanns Hörbiger's Glazial-Kosmogonie in 1912, many other enlightened intellectuals, such as Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark understood the need to compile and organize a pure scientific community along the party-approved line of Gleichschaltung, a hierarchical coordination based on adherence to the official doctrine of national socialism."

While the overwhelming majority of all academic institutions believed such theory with the same fervour a policeman believes the excuses of someone caught pickpocketing, they were forced to keep their criticism for themselves as the Deutsche-Physik had been officially embraced by the NSDAP, and counted personalities such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler themselves among its staunchest supporters: to denounce its falsehood meant being branded as a "Juden-freunde" and subsequently purged. As such, an uneasy peace had been struck between the universities and the party leadership: the former would abstain from openly refuting the theory, while the latter would abstain from sending the most esteemed professors to the concentration camps as enemies of the state, especially since their minds were needed for the war effort more than their arms would be in any slave factory.\n\nAfter Himmler's exile and Hitler's death, and with the new Führer set on a more moderate approach to science and politics, the scientific community is once more in upheaval, and many feel that the day of reckoning has finally come. A scientific council has been convened in Germania, where the most prominent academics from the entire Reich will be present to discuss the future of science in this new era for Germany and the world. Even more importantly, the opening event will be a strong, official rebuttal of the entire doctrine of Deutsche-Physik, to be branded as a 'delirium inspired by racial hate and intellectual deficiency'. In its place, the council will ask for the scientific community to be regulated by merit and experience, rather than boot-licking and party allegiance."

Already letters are piling on the Führer's desk, asking him to officially support one side or the other, and the amount is getting close to the alarm threshold: should Speer refuse to take action, it will be interpreted as a sign of weakness, and he can't afford such a thing!\n\nForced to take action, the Führer stops to reflect. Preventing the council from happening is absolutely out of the question, as it will enrage the universities that were his first and largest support base during the Bürgerkrieg, and now are the fundamental pillar upon which to build a new Reich, filling the technological gap separating the country from the other world powers.\n\nAs it stands, there are only two possible choices: the first is to cave in to the conservatives without angering the scientists, which would mean completely ignoring the council and act as if it never happened, a safe choice in difficult times; the second is to openly support the reformists, and attending the council in person, thus sending a clear message to everyone about the new course the Reich is being set on.

At the given signal, everyone stands as the Führer arrives from the Halle's main entrance, the crowd parting for him like the Red Sea before Moses, until he takes his place: with the brightest mind of the Reich before him, and the Reichstag behind him, he addresses the entirety of the German people.\n\n"Citizens of Germania, today marks a new dawn! After long years of exile inflicted upon them by fools and charlatans, we welcome science, rationality and enlightenment back into our fold, never to let it go a second time!"\nA round of applause, then he resumes: "I wanted to be present to this historical day, to let our esteemed researchers and academics know that their plight has been noted by our government: their bright minds, unparalleled skill and selfless dedication to the cause of science shall pave the way for our country to resume its place among the great nations of Earth!"\n"Let science be one with national socialism as it was meant to be, free from the shackles imposed by envious men who believed they could decide whether innovation was pure or not!

However, the council got almost no media coverage, and its results were publicated only by scientific journals and publications, with the result that, for all intents and purposes, the larger public never knew of its existence, which was exactly what the Führer wanted.\n\nIn the end, he managed to keep the party united by adopting the line of 'less resistance' and, while some reformists were disappointed by his move, and some conservatives were still angry over the fact that the gathering was allowed to happen, no one could truly complain much: the scientists had secured their grand congress, and the conservatives had ensured it would amount to nothing in the political sphere, a perfect result for everyone!"

It seemed the party disagreed with his rejection of Autarky, that dirty word they had begun using more as a propaganda piece than anything.\n\nHe looked at his desk. A cup of coffee - that would soon become much more expensive, if it could even be found in a legitimate market. His desk itself had been a gift from a Japanese dignitary, carved from a single piece of ebony grown in the jungles of Indonesia. No more fancy tropical woods. He looked about at the room he sat in, his office in the Volkshalle, his greatest creation.

He allowed himself a chuckle, and turned to relay his joke to Generalfeldmarshall von Stauffenberg to his right.\n\nThe old Prussian was sweating. Albert had never seen that before - the Volkshalle was famously freezing, a subject even he was not too proud to joke about. There was an odd look on his face. Speer ignored the gentle nudge from Oberlander, who sat to his left, and continued studying von Tresckow. Oberlander in turn ignored Speer as he was so wont to do these days, and called the meeting to order himself. There was a briefcase in the Generalfeldmarshall's lap. He kept toying with the handle as though he was afraid it would leap from his grasp. Henning's eyes, which previously had been vacantly staring at his feet, rose to meet his Führer's.\n\nOberlander continued his vacuous speech but Speer felt deaf.

The staffer who had saved his life had mercifully perished in the initial moments of the explosion. Several of his generals were not so lucky. He would have to give out some posthumous medals later, he supposed. He couldn't remember the name of the staffer - nobody had ever told him. \n\nGeneralfeldmarschall von Tresckow had been obliterated. Much of the debris flying through the room had in fact been him. Albert reached to his collarbone where a small wound lay. They had sent him through the X-Ray to identify anything they'd missed, and identified the tiny fragment of bone that lay underneath, too small to dig out without risking more damage. They were unable to identify to which man it had belonged. \n\nhere would be a purge, naturally. He had thought they had moved past those times, but heads would roll regardless of what he thought. From what he'd been told Tresckow had made few allies in his plan - the last gasp of a foolish traitor, they called it. Most likely they wouldn't let him attend an OKW meeting again, and no doubt Oberlander would snap up the opportunity to "represent" him. Another empty hour to fill his day. Another hour to think about what was. \n\nThere was nobody about who cared about his feelings anymore. He could order someone to listen, but all his guards, his assistants, his staff were more loyal to the party than to their Führer, and eventually every word he spoke would be transcribed and studied by those who claimed to obey him. \n\nThere didn't seem to be much for a Führer to do.

Great bags rested under his eyes, contrasting the pale skin that almost seemed to hang from his bones. His suit clearly hadn't been ironed, and he seemed to almost have shrunk into it.

Perhaps that was why he felt so detached. His menu was the last thing they would allow him control over. Was he refusing to order from it out of spite? Guilt and masochism? He wasn't quite sure. \n\nThat worm Oberländer, treating him like a child having a tantrum. He could have had him shot on a whim, didn't he know? Could have. Everything was a could have or a was these days. He briefly entertained himself with the image of Oberländer lying in a ditch with a hole in his skull. He had seen enough men like that in the past few years. This time, he allowed himself a brief smile as he shook hands, vanishing just as quickly as it appeared. It seemed to worry the officer even more. \n\nHe stepped once again, extended his hand to pin a medal on another man who wasn't there before realising he had reached the end of the line. He turned about face without hesitation and began walking towards his waiting car.\n\nReichsminister Oberländer observed Speer from his own car. He turned to Otto, who seemed just as worried as he did about the Führer's state - though perhaps for different reasons. As Speer's guard Otto's concern was admirable, though his empathy was of little concern to Theodor. "Make sure he eats. Force feed him porridge if you have to, I don't give a damn."

speer_natsoc.7.t:0 "Inside the Third Reich"
speer_natsoc.7.d:0 "He was in the Führerbunker today. His ministers had evidently decided it was too dangerous for him to remain above, either for him or for them. The latest in a long line of peaceful protesters had apparently become tired of being beaten within an inch of their life, or an inch beyond. They demanded to know why their  Führer had lied to them. Why his government stripped away the freedoms of the same ambitious youths who had fought so hard for him. Why those same men they had fought against now occupied such privileged positions. To be honest Albert didn't blame his ministers for keeping him out of hearing range of these students - he wasn't quite sure what had happened either. \n\nA return to form, he supposed. Students had never been fond of him before, of anyone in the party save Hitler in his heyday. The benefit of being surrounded by men in black is your own shade of grey appears sparkling white. Students hate military men, propagandists, and politicians. So he had played the architect, the sensible one, the only sane man. It hadn't been hard. Yet now the men with guns were his, the posters all bore his face, and it was his speeches that the Reichstag clapped at for countless minutes; still, everyone was knee deep in shit. But perhaps he had remembered too late - when did he join, when was he first captivated by Hitler's magnetism? When he was a student. \n\nWhat had changed since he actually seemed to be in charge? He seemed to spend every day wondering how he had arrived in this situation, yet every day he went to bed none the wiser. For so long he had believed it was he that knew how things worked, not that vile arschlock Bormann, or that arrogant opportunistic bastard Göring. He had Hitler's ear, did that not mean something? Yet every year he realised more and more just how little that made him. \n\nHe couldn't hear any of the violence above being perpetrated in his name. So he pretended it wasn't happening."

speer_natsoc.8.t:0 "Germanian Psycho"
speer_natsoc.8.d:0 "My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no-one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.\n\nI am inside my head again. I turn to the minister reading his notes, not that I can remember his name. He was saying something about death warrants. I'll probably have to sign them later. No doubt it would be someone I knew of someone, with too many good ideas making too much noise. I've attended meetings like this in Hitler's day, and I didn't care for them then. I don't care now, though not for the same reason. Back then I was too busy daydreaming of plans of buildings unbuilt. \n\nI know I am daydreaming now, but again for a different reason. People believed in me, but who am I? An architect? A warlord? A dictator? All these and more. I have made excuses every day, pretended to myself he did not see, I did not know, but I had known what was going on and had not cared. Rise higher, throw more people beneath your boots, then perhaps you can make a change.  Then my ego had taken over - why am I surrounded by killers, by liars, by men of such arrogance? Surely I can do better in these trying times than these lunatics? Now I am Hitler, and I seem to be the only one who knows. \n\nI recall the first time he had witnessed a speech from that paradoxical man. I had expected swastikas, brown shirts, roaring and demagoguery. He had been met by the opposite - a man in an inexpensive suit sharing his worries about his country he loved. He had mentioned the Jews of course, but only in passing, a menace of bankers rather than blood. Goebbels had been different, a frothing mess, a roaring croud, a repulsive spectacle. Yet still I joined. I was not choosing the NSDAP but becoming a follower of Hitler, I told myself. He had taken hold of me before I grasped what was happening, I believed for many years. Now I realise that being in a position to know and nevertheless shunning knowledge creates direct responsibility for the consequences."

speer_natsoc.9.d:0 "Unfortunately, Hermann Josef Abs still preferred to deal with Speer personally. Still, it was an opportunity to get out of the Volkshalle where the walls had eyes, and Abs had enough pull to ensure true privacy. Albert sipped his coffee, and picked at the selection of meats on the table before him. \n\n"This will be a much appreciated return to normalcy. Frankly, I had my doubts about that coterie of yours from the beginning, but naturally it was not my business." \n\nAlbert snorted. Everything was Abs' business. "Well, they seemed better than the alternative. I seem to recall you had plenty to say about them when they were infringing on your... business. Far be it from me to tell me how to run your operations, however." \n\nSpeer had remarkably become a more interesting conversationalist since his gang had up and fled. Abs supposed he needed a chance to vent, and he admitted he enjoyed their verbal sparring on some level. While Albert might no longer wield the influence he once did, he was an excellent messenger. "Far be it. Nonetheless, we are expanding our operations in Bayern this month. New factories, accommodation, you know the sort. There are a few documents required to expedite the process. Of course, if they ended up at the top of the pile, the benefits could be passed along." He raised his eyebrows pointedly. "

speer_natsoc.10.t:0 "A New Wave of Slaves" 
speer_natsoc.10.d:0 "Since Speer's ascension, the number of involuntary workers in the Reich had stagnated. Too much pushback to get rid of the institution, too much incompetence and corruption to keep it. Now that those subversive reformist elements had been eliminated, Speer's government could refocus itself on efficient slave management. \n\nIn Wartheland, Poles who did not officially exist are being dragged from their beds. In Ukraine, members of a once-proud Cossack host are surprised at their clandestine meeting by a squad of drunken Wehrmacht soldiers and beaten to unconsciousness before being sold for under-the table-cash. In Russia, sixth children of famine-starved villages are exchanged for an underfed pig or a crate of chickens. The first major slave expansion in twenty years is taking place."
speer_natsoc.10.a:0 "Arbeit macht frei"

speer_natsoc.11.t:0 "Nothing Gets In, Nothing Gets Out"
speer_natsoc.11.d:0 "Knowledge is power, that much he understood. It seemed that was all his gaolers understood as well. They had clearly not grasped that the exchange of information was not a zero-sum game; a concept itself Speer had lifted from the works of a German enjoying the freedoms of America. A little trading is essential, be it resources or knowledge. Still, far be it from him to tell other people what to do. \n\nAlbert glumly signed the papers on his desk once more. He'd spoken with those few contacts in the intelligence community he still believed trustworthy - they too had done their best to express their doubts. Hardliners would be hardliners though. No information other than official state communications would be allowed to escape the Reich, and in turn no foreign communications could be permitted in. Sedition and treason were everywhere these days - or so he heard. \n\nHe turned his radio up - some American band he would likely never hear again. Receiving foreign radio was a crime now, don't you know. If he wanted a record he'd have to barter with one of the staff for it, like some Breton smuggler. Still, it was better than the alternative of only listening to proud Aryan music. God but he was fed up of Wagner."

speer_natsoc.12.t:0 "The New Reichsmarshall"
speer_natsoc.12.d:0 "It was rare he got to do OKW meetings after the incident, but this once had been deemed essential. The guard had been tripled, the building locked down and the courtyards prepared for the parade of six-wheeled Mercedes that never seemed to go out of fashion, despite taking more maintenance than a Tiger. Still, Albert reflected as he looked upon his new Reichsmarshall, perhaps he was just projecting onto the car the faults of its owner. \n\nSpeer had done his best to keep Schörner away from the high echelons of Germania, but the decision was now out of his hands. The Monster In Uniform had another feather in his cap, and his clique were following in earnest. The worst thing was the look in his eyes when he was shaking the bastard's hand. Pure, unfettered pride. Now they would all be forced to deal with his unique management style. \n\nAlbert examined the agenda. Expansion of Wehrmacht funding. Increased recruitment efforts. Military research and development budget tripled. Preferential contracts to IG Farben, Daimler-Benz, Reichswerke, the old guard. Unrepentant reaction to his recent reforms. He sighed, leaned back in his chair, and prepared for a long opening speech."

speer_natsoc.13.t:0 "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"
speer_natsoc.13.d:0 "Albert certainly appreciated the aesthetic of excess - that much could be gleaned from studying any of his buildings. Still, all things must have a function, and he was hard pressed to find the function of this place. The Reich had invested a great deal into nuclear power, but this plant produced practically none. Still the reactor thrummed away, atoms crashing and splitting with one end product - Plutonium. They had accumulated Uranium aplenty from their conquests in Russia and Africa, but that volatile and vital component in nuclear weapons was always needed now more than ever or so he was told. \n\nFissile material production had ramped up in response to the Reich's recent demand that their weapons stockpile be doubled in size, to appropriately operate as a deterrent. Speer did not see the difference - one city killing bomb will kill as many as a hundred if there are no more cities to be found. To his new ministers it seemed an economic stimulus, allowing for great expansion within those old, proud companies that dominated heavy industry and big science. To Schörner it was another opportunity to swing his weight and make room for himself. To him, it was a waste There would be no economic recovery if there were no people to recover it. And if Schörner got his way, there would be all the room in the world."
speer_natsoc.13.a:0 "Uranium breeds Plutonium, Paranoia breeds Violence"

speer_natsoc.14.t:0 "Higher than the Alps"
speer_natsoc.14.d:0 "It had been a long time since Albert had been to Austria. Bormann had rather spoiled the atmosphere in the Berghof with his tasteless redecorating, and Albert had been more focused on his own projects than renovating yet another of Hitler's houses. Still, the state visits never ended, and it wasn't like there was much outside the Reich to visit any more. This was admittedly one of the better views he'd seen on his travels, however. \n\nThe crunch of boots on snow was outlining the figures the officer offered him. How the hell they hauled this many tanks up here he'd never know. The normally stark white slopes of the alps seemed carpeted in Feldgrau, tents beyond number. On the higher slopes he noted mortar positions, subtle dots of sniper nests, flak guns ready to repel any plane that dared to stray too close to the gun-toting obelisk they inhabited. Unfortunately for Albert it had been a bumpy ride in a truck with some stern-faced Fallschirmjagers followed by a hike that had left his knees weak - no helicopter could reach this rarefied level of air. \n\nHe waved his hand at his binocular-toting secretary, and raised the pair to his eyes. The Italians too occupied a spot in the clouds, scant kilometres away, across tank traps, minefields, Czech hedgehogs and enough barbed wire to enclose Ost-Paris. He'd seen the reports, things were escalating here. More equipment, more men, bigger plans, the OKW had demanded it all and got it. He just prayed there would be no spark to light the fuse."

speer_natsoc.15.t:0 "Another Runner in the Night"
speer_natsoc.15.d:0 "He should have seen it coming, in hindsight. The gang of reformists that he had gathered around himself, so often attempting to assert their own will in place of his own, ceasing their bleating for one blessed moment? He had welcomed it. He wasn't quite sure what the final straw had been, there seemed to have been so much debate between them all in the smoky halls of the Volkshalle. All he knew was that when their respective secretaries made their morning calls, Messers Kiesinger, Erhard and Schmidt, and their families were not there. They had searched, naturally, and found themselves at the end of a trail that had could have been years in the planning, one last ratline in the event they didn't get their way.\n\nHe had raged, at first. It was a rare time he let his temper get the better of him, but that night was the first in a month of furious tantrums; against that Gang of Three with their conspiracies; against the Reich he had worked so hard to fix crumbling before his eyes; at himself. Most of all, however, he was afraid. He could feel the sharks circling. There were other, less enlightened members of the party that believed themselves more suitable for the task than he - and he was too dangerous to be left alive. \n\nHe was wrong. Oberlander had neutered him, shoved his hand up his arse and was now controlling him like a ventriloquist's dummy. No more allies meant no more Speer. Of that band of like-minded reformists, only von Tresckow remained, too loyal to his Prussian ideals to ever contemplate mutiny. Albert envied him that simplicity. Now his erstwhile allies were likely sunning themselves in America - all too eager to leave their Reich behind."
speer_natsoc.15.a:0 "We remain."

speer_natsoc.16.t:0 "Damnatio Memoriae"
speer_natsoc.16.d:0 "It is all too easy to forget a person ever existed. We are only so much as the mark that we leave on this world, Albert reflected from his living room. Margarete was out somewhere, not that they paid one another much attention these days. It was all too easy to simply spend the evening gazing into the fire, flick a piece of paper and watch it wither and curl. He had almost forgotten his book.\n\nIt didn't do to have traitors in the former ranks of such esteemed men as his current cabinet, so they had been removed. Every piece of paper they had signed was redacted. Every law they signed could be repealed, for it was a sabotage. Even their homes had been demolished, and mention of their names had been forbidden from any form of news. It didn't bear saying what had happened to their housekeeping staff. \n\nIn America no doubt they would be telling tales of the daring snub to the Reich, but here no news of their escape would ever run. People might ask what had happened to the ministers, but they would never get an answer - and eventually they would reach their own conclusions.  He returned to his book. \n\n"
speer_natsoc.16.a:0 "Who the hell was Herostratus?"

speer_natsoc.17.t:0 "The Speer Defense"
speer_natsoc.17.d:0 "It's easy to blame something on someone who isn't there. Like a fart in an elevator, blame belongs to whoever left last. Therefore the logical thing to do was to blame every problem on their recent departures. \n\nThere was an economic downtown? It wasn't me. \nTurn your information over? It wasn't me.\nOur government is losing power? It wasn't me.\nInstall security cameras? It wasn't me. \n\nIndeed, to the party it had seemed like there was all too little Albert had done. It was only natural someone else take the reins, if only as a guiding hand. It seems denying culpability only gets you so far. The propaganda continued however - the Gang of Four had been spies, infiltrators of the highest order. Perhaps in a way it was true. It had certainly been a blunder of the highest order."
speer_natsoc.17.a:0 "Shifting the blame is much easier than taking it."

speer_natsoc.18.t:0 "I'm Just a Soul Whose Intentions are Good"
speer_natsoc.18.d:0 "Collective responsibility had been something he had taken very seriously while he still had some weight to throw around - while the Führer made the decision, everyone agreed it was the best decision. As such, all the awful, treasonous ideas of that clique of traitors would be collectively agreed to be eliminated - only this time, the shoe was on the other foot. It was his own ministers so eagerly dictating the removal of their predecessors' ideas. While Albert agreed with a few of these in principal, he most certainly disagreed with the gusto with which "his" ministers went about their business without consulting him. \n\nSpeer had always done his best to portray himself as the benevolent type of dictator, but that was becoming all the more difficult when his ministers' approach had shifted from velvet glove to iron gauntlet. The people had liked his new breed of more civil ministers, especially the students who had put him in this building in the first place. But god, if he didn't miss their bickering. He was certainly reminded of it enough by the pile of documents he had to plough through to eliminate their subversive influence. \n\nAnother law revoked - stamp. Another plan cancelled - stamp. Another protection removed - stamp."

speer_natsoc.19.t:0 "Coffee with Kiesinger"
speer_natsoc.19.d:0 "Naturally, his subversive former friends were being monitored closely. Once the Reich's sharpest men had been made aware the trail existed they reached the other end with a mere hop of the Atlantic. Albert had contemplated having them eliminated, but decided against it. The open murder of former government officials claiming asylum was too brazen by half. They were instead watched from a distance, and Albert received reports on their activities every single day. \n\nHe recalled the mornings he had spent with Kiesinger, a cup of coffee and a sharp debate. Kurt had always been the easiest of them to deal with, the most realistic. Those talks had been spirited, but had never exasperated him nearly as much as that windbag Erhard. He had always seemed to have the right words to get what he wanted, and Speer would observe him running circles about him just as often as the other two. \n\nAlbert sipped his coffee and flicked through the report. Kiesinger had been talking to the Americans of course, who knew how long for. Every day he met with CIA agents, who were presumably digging for every scrap of information about Speer and his new government. Kurt would have them hanging on his every word for as long as he desired."

speer_natsoc.20.d:0 "Schmidt was confusing. He had been deferential, polite, capable. At first, his only flaw had been the smoking. They'd actually had to increase the cleaning budget to deal with the buildup on the ceilings. But as time went on, something beneath was revealed. Schmidt did not like many of the people he worked with. He did not like many of the policies his government had. He seemed to dislike the Reich as an institution. \n\nNow of course, Speer knew that was exactly the case. Schmidt was a subversive, probably in league with Reichsbanner before he was forced to make his escape. While Erhard maintained himself by mooching off the economists of his host nation and Kiesinger was feeding the government information on a slow drip, Schmidt was openly denouncing his birth country, writing his tell all memoirs. The informants in his household had managed to acquire a photograph of a page for his perusal. "Inside the Third Reich" was a uniquely unflattering picture of Speer and his management, and alluded to many things Albert would have rather kept under wraps."

speer_natsoc.21.d:0 "Erhard had been the most annoying of them all. Filled a seat like Göring, talked like he was Bismarck and smoked like a camp chimney. Certainly, Speer's management of the economy had not been miraculous, but the way Erhard had talked he wanted to tear it up by the roots made his blood boil. Now he was extolling the virtues of his own miraculous economic system, which would have saved the Reich from every damning flaw it had, real or imagined. \n\nThe Americans were eating it up by the sounds of it. His insights were being hailed as one of the best looks into the German system in decades, and he had apparently acquired his own coterie of "Continental Style" economists. Let them have the interminable naysayer. At least he could finally get a meeting done without having to open a window."

Rome defined itself by the mediterranean, their 'Mare Nostrum', while China, Portugal and Holland capitalised on spice flows to a greedy West. Humanity's first nations followed a similar origin point. Along the Indus, Yellow and Nile rivers, civilizations rose on the backs of boats carrying the boons of the agricultural revolution upstream and downstream. Preceding the building of any man's home is the greasing of palms, or a suitable means to begin doing so. \n\nModern nations follow the same principles. That's why, before the gun, a wise statesman has always picked the embargo; more discrete and far more vicious than it's lethal counterpart. Smith's prediction of a globalised economy has only assisted this balance further. One can defeat a breadless enemy before a single shot is fired. \n\nAll war must end, however, and today the economic war that the Reich and the United States have fought for decades is closing. The embargo has been lifted, and the lungs of the dormant commercial titan of the Hanseatic can breathe once more. Industrial works in the Ruhr bellow with a rejuvenated spirit, and the Germania Stock Exchange is entering what the American's call a 'bull market'. Both the Führer and the President have given optimistic speeches, celebratory words delivered from the Volkshalle and the White House, while their foreign ministries conclude business and return home in a better world. \n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise on an Atlantic at rest, with once bitter enemies shaking hands. In war, there are no winners, and in this peace history would seem to have produced two."

"You're saying there's a rebellion on?"\n\n"I'm not saying there's a rebellion, there IS a rebellion! They're all over the place!" The diplomat's voice crackled over the radio, the rattle of rifle fire occasionally making its way into the receiver. The fire was rapid, fast, and seemingly close. Helmut shifted as a mental picture began to form in his head.\n\n "So it's another slave rebellion. Well, shit, do what we did with the last one." He muttered into the phone, a hint of confusion mixing into his normal stately tone.\n\n "No, Helmut, you don't understand. This isn't some slave revolt. The whole fucking city is up in arms! They've got Reichsbanner flags, they're chanting-"\n\n"Reichsbanner?" A shot of excitement fired up Schmidt's spine, quickly followed by fear. This was simultaneously very good and very bad. "Shit, are you sure?"\n\n"We can't put this down! They've got guns, they've got ammo, I think they've stolen a few tanks- oh, shit!" The screeching of metal faintly pulsed through the receiver, quickly accompanied by the roaring of an angry crowd. "Fuck, ok, I've got to go. We're evacuating. Warschau is lost, repeat, Warschau is lost!" The line went dead with a slam.\n\nHelmut stood in disbelief, still glued to the phone. Finally, after a moment of silence, he dropped the receiver and rushed to the train station. This was going to be big."

Speidel, Schmidt, Kiesinger, Erhard, Tresckow- he could tell that each of them had rushed here on short notice. Their reactions were similarly varied- Speidel's calm exterior was betrayed by his deeply furrowed brow, Erhard and Tresckow both seemed worried, Kiesinger showed only mild interest, and Schmidt seemed to be almost excited at the thought. Speer regarded him with an extra stare before beginning. "So, give me a rundown."\n\n "Well, my Fuhrer-" Speidel began, but was quickly cut off by Schmidt's quick talking. "My Fuhrer, the Poles of Warschau have risen up, aided by the Reichsbanner. Apparently, this "Spartakus" has made his presence known there, and they're setting up for a potential counterattack. The Polish government is in disarray- they're trying to set up a new government, but they're not having a good time of it. The rebels have gone about freeing the slaves, lifting the Nuremberg laws, repealing restrictions-"\n\n "Why are you so excited about this, Helmut? They're fucking it all up! I've done so damn much for them and this is how they repay me? I don't know why I ever listened to any of you if all you do is give me problems!" Speer shouted, slamming his fist into the table. Schmidt recoiled, as did the rest of the gang- this was new.\n\nThe sudden silence was broken by the entrance of the secretary, delivering a new report to the Fuhrer. He read it, reread it, and then threw it in the air with a resounding "FUCK!"."

That's all he's been doing for the entire time I've worked with him."\n\nKiesinger sighed. Perhaps he should have expected this- Speer's revolt to the slave siege some time ago hadn't exactly been a reasoned one. "In any case, my Fuhrer, we can't truly have an effective response until we know how far this is going to spread. It'll do us no good to try and put out these fires while more are picking up."\n\n "Why don't you look yourself, Kiesinger? Here we are, with our plans unravelling before us, with everything the conservatives said would happen coming true, and you're all standing around here preaching the merits of the Reichsbanner? Hell, Schmidt's been basically on their side since he got here!" Speer snapped.\n\n "I never said I was in support of the slaves." Schmidt responded. Speer turned to him with an incredulous look.\n\n "Bullshit. You think I'm dumb, Helmut? I can see it on your face. You've been waiting for this for years." Schmidt opened his mouth to respond, but Kiesinger waved him off.\n\n "In any case, my Fuhrer, we must wait until the cards fall. This is certain to get worse before it gets better." Kiesinger stated. As if to prove his point, the secretary returned, bearing more bad news. Speer groaned as he read it- before, at least it was confined to Poland.

Reports of isolated uprisings in factories, slave mobs arming themselves in the rebel holdouts, the occasional gunbattles with police and soldiers, and the slow consolidation of the rebels into an organized army. Every report that came in angered Speer even more, and only hardened his resolve against the other four men in this room.\n\nWhat a fool he was to trust them! Every step of the way, they had subverted his requests and gone against his orders. They had forced him, over and over, to agree with them and avoid collapse. Ever since he had brought them on, they had made his job harder than it ever had to be. And now, at the hour of Germany's greatest danger since World War II, here they were to subvert him again, poisoning his ideals and dragging Germany away from what made it such a power to start with.\n\nHe wouldn't take any more of it, he decided. From here on in, he would call the shots, not some petty idealists or fat capitalist or some old military man. As the report of the next city to fall- Minsk- came in, he made up his mind. Now was the time to really show who the true power in Germany was- him, Albert Speer."

speer_slaverevolt.5.desc:0 "As reports continued to roll in of spontaneous rebellions, clear trends began to emerge from the haze. Speer reviewed them and pieced them together, a master architect building his latest work- not one of stone or steel, but one of statitistics. The cities that had revolted so far all fit the same few categories. Kiew, Warschau, Minsk, Krakow- all were poor, eastern cities. None had been successfully Germanized. Each still had significant amounts of slaves, whether personal or company owned. Finally, the major kicker- each had abnomally high levels of Reichsbanner activity. Perhaps it was the relatively young demographics of each city, or perhaps it was the universities, but the pattern was clear. A plan formed in Speer's head- this was still controllable. With the right analysis and the right plan, he could stop this rebellion in its tracks.\n\nAnd then a revolt seized Riga, and the statistics crumbled away.\n\nRiga shared none of these tells with the other cities, besides a high slave population. It held a significant German minority. It was rich, even after the chaos that had engulfed Ostland years ago. It had not even had a major Reichsbanner presence. Yet, here it was, another angry red mark of revolt splintering the Reich. Speer put the paper down on his desk to join the pile, sighed, and tore the rest of his analysis off the corkboard. Perhaps there was no pattern to this. Perhaps there was no stopping it."

speer_slaverevolt.6.desc:0 "Body- There had been one saving grace to the Slave Revolt- its adherence to the cities. Each revolt was confined merely to the city- painful, but containable. The Heer, mobilized to action by the Fuhrer's personal order, sat in siege around the city, a complicated standoff ensuing between the slaves and the soldiers- neither side willing to fire first. As long as the revolt stayed inside the urban jungle, the Reich still stood.\n\nOf course, it didn't.\n\nSomehow, someway, the news spread to the slave plantations that still toiled in the countryside. One by one, the slaves found their spines, taking up arms against their masters and burning their fields to the ground. Mobs met each other and became armies, tearing through the countryside and burning any slaveowning home they found. Soon enough, the Wehrmacht found itself flanked, and- humiliatingly- was forced to retreat as the country slaves jubilously met with the students and rebels of the cities.\n\nAs the mood out east turned joyous, the mood in the Fuhrer's office darkened. Speer slammed his fist into his table, barely suppressing a angry yell. This was all that rat bastard gang's fault. They had played with fire, and now the whole Reich would burn."

speer_slaverevolt.7.desc:0 "Despite its relative calm compared to other Reichskommissariaten, it seems Moskowien hasn't been spared from the chaos of the slave revolt. While indentured servants in the former Russian lands are far less than across the rest of the Reich, they still make up a considerable number, and it seems that the general chaos gripping the entire German colonial empire has emboldened them.\n\nAll across the Reichskommissariat, tens of thousands of slaves break their chains and assault the German garrisons overseeing their suffering, taking their weapons and establishing pockets of resistance in the Russian plains. They ask for freedom, and most of them are ready to fight to the death rather than kneel once more. If they are to die - this is the message relayed to the Reichskommissar - they will die as free men.\n\nEven though their numbers swell with every passing day, and local authorities struggle to protect the cities from the increasing wave of dissent, it seems that - unlike the metropolitan Reich - reaction is mounting. Reports tell of German regular forces regrouping under the leadership of Feldmarschall Schörner, and preparing for a counter-offensive: the general has sworn to return order to the Russian Reichskommissariat, "no matter the cost"

They pushed through the door at the end of the corridor and marched up the crimson stairs, stepping around the crumpled bodies that punctuated every turn. When the gang reached the top, an armed officer saw them approach and thrust his hand into the air.\n\n"Heil Schörner!"\n\nFerdinand Schörner saluted in response. The traces of a smile were tugging at his lips, threatening to ruin his forcefully stern expression as he marched his men towards the cabinet room. At last, Moskau was his. Moskowien was his. The coup has been an absolute success, although naturally he had not been there to witness it.\n\nAnyone who dared resist the militarist infiltration of Moskau's government buildings – from the lowliest secretaries and guards to the highest politicians and generals – were shot on site. The rest were in the process of being deported to KZ like the traitors they were.\n\nThe men entered the cabinet room. Blood was splattered across the framed portraits that hung on the walls. Remer took a seat at the far end of the table and began speaking in a mockingly reedy voice, replicating Alexis von Roenne's mannerisms perfectly. The militarists cackled with laughter.  A gunshot rang out somewhere on the floor below them.\n\nThe Reich cried out for a savior as the waves of treason threatened to drown it forever, and Schörner answered the call.

He looked up at the gang and placed a finger squarely on the text. "You want to know what this says?"\n\nSilence. Ashamed, total silence. No gang member even dared to stare into Speer's flaming eyes.\n\n "'Feldmarschall Schörner has, after his coup in Moskowien, seized control of revolting areas through swift, forceful action. From the little information we are currently receiving, Reichsbanner rebels have either retreated into hiding or fled." Speer read, matter of factly. He looked up again when he finished. Still, none of the others dared to respond. "You know what this means? It means that Ferdinand fucking Schörner is the Reich's face of stability and action, and we're standing around with our pants down!"\n\n "Well, my Fuhrer, Schörner has the luxury to just run over protestors with tanks-" Schmidt started. Speer cut him off with a furious wave of his hand.\n\n "And why can't we do the same? They're the rebels. If the American students started shooting at their soldiers, they wouldn't pussyfoot around with their response, would they?"\n\nSilence- a stunned, disbelieving silence- entered the room. Slowly, the gang filed out, and Speer sat back down. That was certainly too far, but was it not a justified outburst? If Germania didn't do something and fast, Schörner would do it for them, and then they'd be in real trouble."

Bands of slaves roam the countryside and the cities, but without a unified leadership they act as they please: some merely try to return home, while others sack houses and stores, attacking all German settlers in sight."

Under the current circumstances, the first choice was preferred, though it is unknown whether the decision was motivated by humanity or lack of means.\n\nWith the German garrison gone, and the central government still reeling from the magnitude of what's happening, very few believe that the Reich will try to reclaim Galicia soon. Thousands of Russian and Ukrainian slaves roam the region, some of them moving East trying to find a way home, while others take advantage of the lack of security to exact their vengeance upon those unlucky enough to have been left behind."

The central government has started to debate the best solution to fight the uprising, but unless drastic measures are taken immediately, the situation will most likely continue, and infect even more regions."

With barely enough time to gather their families, the officials were hurriedly evacuated alongside most of the garrison.\n\nWith the fall of Minsk, one of the main centers of German administration in Eastern Europe, the chain of command is quickly coming apart as the remaining minor administrations desperately try to save themselves from what is felt more and more like a looming doom.

Faced with the prospect of having to fight to the death against a human wave, or call the Luftwaffe and burn the city to ashes to keep order, the commander chose retreat.\n\nWithin a few hours, the government and their families were evacuated to Crimea in a heavily-escorted convoy, immediately followed by most remaining German forces and all those who feared for their lives.

For the people, it was when the news reports began to talk about how the Heer was "containing" the unrest. For Schorner, it was when his men stopped reporting casualty numbers from skirmishes with the Reichsbanner.\n\nYes, it was a peace- a shaky one, built only on the unwillingness of Germany to attack, but a peace. Soldiers on both sides dug in, from the forests of Lithuania to the fields of Ukraine. The Reichsbanner's rebellion had torn the Reich in half, literally- one half dominated by Schorner and his militarists, undoubtedly plotting for the final blow against Speer and his reformism. The other half digging in, trying to find some way to end the crisis before the winds of revolution spread further. Between them, a red strip of land, dominated by idealists, slaves, and students.\n\nIt was a powderkeg waiting to blow, but for now, the spark was not yet lit.

In this chaotic situation, worrying reports are filtering: they talk about hundreds of mercenaries reaching Aserbaidschan from Moskowien and by airplane, paid for by the corporations and led by a former SS-turned-mercenary called Otto Weidinger.

The city was evacuated soon after.\n\nAs the local administration and the remaining soldiers flee towards Moskowien to find refuge, the government in Germania reels from the hit.

When the first uprisings began in the countryside, and smaller cells became active in the city itself, all valuable assets were evacuated by ship to Crimea, where the administration is trying to reorganize and resist.\n\nAs communications struggle to come to and from Germania, the situation grows even more difficult. If decisive action isn't taken immediately, the last of Ukraine may soon fall, and even the heavily-Germanized parts of the country are in danger: already barricades and trenches dot the Dnepr, manned by survivors from the garrison and local militias hastily risen from the population fearing violence from the slaves."

Baku's Gauleiter is currently being detained "for incompetence and corruption" until a "proper trial" can be held. The government in Germania immediately branded Weidinger's men as traitors and ordered their arrest, but even the Führer knows these are but empty words: with no way to transport troops to Baku due to the slave revolt, and the not-so-subtle threat of sabotaging the oil drills hanging in the air, the central government can only wait.\n\nSuspicions are arising, however, over a massive air lift paradropping weapons and supplies from Moskowien, paid for by corporations deeply tied to Abs, Flick and their clique of industrialists.

Both men, however, seemed to be dallying with time, running deep into the night but still a thought that preoccupied both of their minds remained. "I think we can finish it here, Herr Tresckow." Speidel said, and the Prussian gave a half-hearted nod. "Everything is in place. The Heer is moving in, the Luftwaffe is preparing to take off, and the Kriegsmarine is ready to ship our troops over. All we must do is wait."\n\nTresckow in particularly seemed particularly out of it that night. "Correct, I suppose, Herr Speidel. I..." He rubbed his forehead. "By God, that's assuming that madman Speer doesn't just roll over the slaves." He gave Speidel a look of concern and frustration. "Have you heard what he has been saying recently? It's like he's gone mad. Like that old fool Hitler-" Speidel subconsciously grasped his fingers against the desk tightly. "In his last days. Mad, I tell you. Whenever he mentions Schmidt, he always seems to have this sort of vile tone to him, like a snake. I don't know what he's done to deserve it."\n\nSpeidel let out a sigh. "Herr Tresckow, you should retire for the night. The stress is getting to you." The general was right - bags that grew heavier by the days formed under Tresckow's eyes, and the old Prussian seemed on the brink of exhaustion. "Perhaps," he began, looking at Speidel. "Can I make a confession to you, Herr Speidel?" The man nodded."

 speerreichsbanner.1.desc:0 "The meeting room of the Reichskanzlei was stiff with emotions. Albert Speer sat in the front, and his hands were pressed tightly together, while his teeth grinded endlessly. The other five, the Gang and Hans Speidel, were mainly the ones convening with each other. All of them, however - and especially Schmidt - could still feel the rage emanating from the Führer, who hadn't spoken a word since the meeting. Kiesinger cut the silence.\n\n"Speidel, you're saying we remain quiet?" The general nodded. "Right... and the hope in doing so is that the slaves will eventually reach out to us, seeing as how we will not plan any moves of our own."\n\n"If I may," Erhard cut in. "Shouldn't we move our troops away from the border, just to let them know that we don't mean any harm?" The moment he was done, his eyes flicked to the Führer, who began speaking as soon as Erhard bit the cigar between his teeth.\n\n"And let the bandits move in and pillage our German settlers?!" He shouted. The rest stared in silence. "Ridiculous, t-this is sheer insanity- they can't even control themselves to act peacefully, let alone we decide to give them so much trust that they do not deserve!"\n\nNobody spoke for the next few seconds, and Speer's eyes settled from one person to another, and then back again, and then back again, and his trembling hands scratched the table idly. "What are you looking at me for? Come on, speak! Pretend I'm not here! Bolsheviks, the lot of you, I..."\n\nSpeidel decided to return his look to Kiesinger and speak on his own behalf. "Do you agree, then? If they begin to leverage diplomacy on their own terms, we could start things off strongly with them, and use that to our advantage." Kiesinger reluctantly shrugged."

 speerreichsbanner.2.desc:0 "Something had arrived in Helmut Schmidt's office in the Reichskanzlei that day, and he had read every line of it carefully. By the end, he was grasping the letter tightly, doubt coursing through his mind.\n\n"Dear Helmut Schmidt, Minister of Foreign Affairs,\n\nThis is Willy Brandt speaking. I am at the helm of Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, naturally, but I come to you with an offer. Your government has been deathly silent as of recent, and it is slowly beginning to unnerve the army of Free Europe. Some say that you are preparing for an attack, but I know better. Come, Helmut Schmidt. You have been the representative of Germany's more humane face, have you not? I ask you to present this letter to Herr Speer freely. I suppose, in the end, it is his letter to read. Now, here is what I have to say.\n\nWe shall hold a meeting in Warsaw, in the St. Alexander's Church. I pick it because it is a holy place, and no holy place should be a battlefield for violence. I will also ask you another, perhaps more important thing. As a show of peace, I ask of you to come with only you and your diplomats. There is no need for guns to march between priests and crosses. I am uncertain if you shall follow through with this, but if you do, I will remain ever grateful for the move.\n\nAnd my final statement will be this. To Herr Speer, to you, Helmut Schmidt, to Ludwig Erhard, to Kurt Georg Kiesinger, to Henning von Tresckow. I should congratulate you all for taking Germany so far. It was as dark as shadows before, and for a while I had feared for its existence. But my hope has strengthened, and I am joyous that the free, humane, and democratic Germany still lives. Thank you for your cooperation, and if all goes well, I shall be seeing you soon.\n\n - Willy Brandt."\n\nThere was no time to ponder. Helmut Schmidt had to choose."

 speerreichsbanner.3.desc:0 "When Helmut Schmidt stepped through the door into the St. Alexander's Church, he felt himself enter another world. Something about its air was not the oppressive and dreadful one he could feel outside. It did not echo the cry of slaves, the breaking of chains, none such thing. It was as if Schmidt was thrown into a different universe altogether. Where none of this madness was forced to happen.\n\nThere were only four faces he saw. The only one he recognized by face was Willy Brandt, but he could recognize the others by association. One was Karol Józef Wojtyła, a Catholic priest who Schmidt could immediately recognize in his clothing. Another was Viacheslav Chornovil, though he did not know much of him, and the last was Nadezhda Troyan, former NKVD agent and assassin of Wilhelm Kube. He did not like her beliefs, though respected her guts to do such a thing. All of them, however, remained silent, as Brandt approached him.\n\n"Well, if it isn't the famous Helmut Schmidt." With a wide smile, he brought his hand out and the two gave each other a strong handshake. "I take it that you are a bit more sympathetic to our cause than that friend of yours you call Herr Speer?"\n\nSchmidt, at first, bit his tongue. He didn't want to risk saying the wrong thing - but then he realized just where exactly he was. "Friend..." He huffed a laugh through his nose. "Is not exactly what I would call him, but that's neither here nor there. It will be a pleasure to negotiate these dealings with you, Herr Brandt. I have much reason to support your cause."\n\nBrandt gave Schmidt a sharp look and a sly smile. "To support implies that you have done nothing yet to aid the cause of the Reichsbanner." When he said that, Schmidt was filled with the need to take a step back out of anxiety, but instead let out an amused yet nervous chuckle."

Without hesitance, and with all the promised haste in the world."\n\nHelmut Schmidt nodded. "You know - you are quite the bold one with your demands, Herr Brandt." The leader of the slave revolt merely gave a smile. "And you are giving quite the lack of pushback. Hmm... I would have expected a man of the Reich to be angrier at this, but I appreciate the sanity nonetheless. Now..."\n\n"... on the matter of the protesters, the freedom fighters in Germany, the brave men and women who wish only to liberate those that deserve not the wanton cruelty of the Reich that has plagued them for decades, I demand that they are all let go. To return to their homes in peace, and not for any police force, secret or otherwise, detain or harass or injure them in any way - nor do I want the military to crack down on them."\n\nTo Schmidt, this was almost like having a pleasant conversation with a friend. "I could not guarantee their safety, though there would be hell to pay if anyone decided to commit violence to them." Brandt let out a short laugh. "Good, good. Now, the final demand." He cleared his throat.\n\n"On the matter of repatriation. I demand that Germany begin immediate and extensive reparations to all slaves and their families. They will be compensated in full, as for the evil that the Reich has wrought on them must be cleansed, even if it will take decades for it to rinse away completely. The terms are non-negotiable, Herr Schmidt. Do you agree?"\n\nSchmidt blinked once or twice at the last demand. That would have put a major strain on Germany's budget, but... what right did he have to deny them that? It took him mere seconds to respond."

 speerreichsbanner.5.desc:0 ""I- I tried to make them understand! I swear! Please!"\nHelmut Schmidt had let go of any pretense of dignity, and was now openly begging the man on the other end of the phone. A pity though, because his interlocutor had none to spare for him: a laugh was the only answer to his pleas, one that had anything but mirth in it.\n"How entertaining! The proud Helmuth Schmidt is begging! If only you could be here in my office, I'd give half of the Reich, MY Reich, only to see your face!" came the Führer's voice.\n"I have always wanted to see the face a traitor makes when he's reduced to begging for his useless life! Not a big loss, though... Rewards come to the patient, and guess who I have right outside of my office?"\n\n"You wouldn't dare-"\n\n"That's right! The almighty Gang of Four! Ungrateful bastards, I saved you from Heydrich! I covered your crimes for years! You would be nothing without me, NOTHING! But now I can finally have my revenge. Sweet, sweet revenge, for all the humiliations, for all the times you threatened me, you sniveling wretches... Don't try to flee, little cheater, don't rob me of my pleasure: I'll find you and kill you even in Washington..." then the tone changed again, and Speer was laughing once more.\n"Enjoy your last hours, there are so many things you can do: hanging, poison, or the great classic, a bullet! Choose quickly, or I'll be the one to do it for you... Oh, before I forget: make yourself pretty, the ORPO is coming..."\n\nThe line went dead, but Schmidt was no longer focused on it. He was too terrorized to care about it, and not because of Speer's death threats: his fearful gaze was fixed on the mirror in front of him. His own reflection was staring at him, along with his father, and thousands of faces, all chanting the same word, over and over and over and over and over.\n"Traitor!" screamed his father, rage twisting his old face into a hate-filled grimace.\n"Traitor!" laughed his own reflection, blood gushing from a hole in his forehead.\n"Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!" echoed all the men, women and children in the room. All of them dead, including himself. All of them dead, and it was his fault. His and his alone."

"Now, on to the topic, yes?" Schmidt nodded.

I can understand your position - how you'd love to rip those damn papers up with your own hands-" Schmidt felt himself tense up. With our without eyes and ears to watch them, this sort of open talk made him uncomfortable, and he raised his hand up, which made Brandt stop after a second or two more of talking.\n\n"I will make my decision now, Herr Brandt. There is no need to worry." Schmidt wondered - how was it that this man always talked like he was in control? No wonder he was leading an entire slave revolt. He had to respect the man, he did more than Schmidt ever could while under Speer's thumb; but he was forced to discard those thoughts. The negotiations were at play. Not his emotions.

No children played in the abandoned school: as the rabbi - an old man who had seen so much suffering and pain that God would have needed to build a new paradise just for him - once said, who would be so evil to let a child be born only to suffer?\n\nTherefore, it was with a heart as heavy as the gates of the ghetto that the rabbi listened to the unmistakable creaking sound, but when he looked outside, no one was there: in the place of the Germans was a poster. His heart filled with fear - was it the order of their extermination? - but he steeled himself and read.\n\n"Extract from the Law on Racial Equality as published on the Reichsgesetzblatt [GetDateText], to be entered into force the day of its publication.\nSection 1, Paragraph 1: "sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Citizen Law and sections 1 to 7 of the Law for Protection of German Blood and German Honor, as promulgated and published on Reichsgesetzblatt Part I, 16th September 1936 and entered into force the day 1st of January 1936 are hereby abrogated".\nParagraph 2: "mention of race in any law, regulation or administrative directive within the Reich is to be replaced by ethnicity"\nSection 2, Paragraph 1: "no man may be subjected to discrimination or any punishment or labor for the sole fact of his belonging to any ethnicity"\nParagraph 2: "economic reparation for subjection to any of the treatments mentioned in the above paragraph will be distributed according to a future law"\n\nFor a minute, the old rabbi looked at the paper in disbelief, then the first tears descended in the channels that so many years of silent crying had dug into his cheeks. Finally, he turned his head to the heavy gates that had been the end of their world for three decades, and he saw them open, the first ray of the morning sun carving a path to the exit: he knew it then, he knew how Moses had felt when the waters of the Red Sea had opened before him.

It was the priest that was documented - lightly, unfortunately, as all he knew was that he was a worshipper belonging to the Catholic faith, and that his colleagues called him quite a good one at that. Now they were opposing each other on the table that stood in the middle of the church, and the warm graces of Wojtyła's voice soothed Schmidt's nerves.\n\n"I am no German," he began, his thick Polish accent rising through the silence, "but I'm sure you will understand me all the same." Schmidt gave a polite nod, and ushered him to continue. Wojtyła gave a light smile.\n\n"My son, I am sure you are aware that there cannot be peace in this... Einheitspakt of yours, unless its people are allowed to voice their opinions freely." Schmidt pressed his hands together. The worst was out of the way. Now came what he would call the 'secondary demands', and here he would have to weigh whether to hold back or push in. The priest continued. "I merely ask you this. Let them have their voices be heard. Many fight against it... the change that your Reich has brought. Not only in Germany, but everywhere else, too. I see them fighting for something better. The rest, I am sure, share my sentiments."\n\nThe rest - Brandt, Viacheslav, Nadezhda, all of them nodded silently. Schmidt, meanwhile, sighed. "I understand, Herr Wojtyła.

Even after massacring my people, they haven't given us any gift. Not even a token one."\n\nSchmidt's stomach sunk. Generalplan Ost was a specter that would haunt Europe forever, wouldn't it? "Am I to assume this is talking about allowing democratization of members of the Einheitspakt?"\n\nViacheslav nodded enthusiastically. "You're quick on your feet, Mister Schmidt! That's exactly what it's about! A healthy nation holds elections and elects people who know what they're doing, where they're doing it, and how! I want that - the liberalization, I mean - to be applied in full force across Europe in the countries that Germany keeps putting under its heel. What about it, Mister Schmidt? Is that a deal?"\n\n"Well..." Schmidt rubbed the back of his neck. "This action would cause uproar back home. As tense as the situation is right now, I'm uncertain if we can afford it. The political capital needed to be expended in order to allow free elections in the Einheitspakt, notwithstanding the conditions in Germany itself..."\n\nViacheslav waved his hand dismissively. "Nonsense, nonsense! They will come around to see what's best for everyone! The big men in Ber-B--Germania, I mean, sorry-", "Not a problem-", "Berlin? Germania. Anyways, they might be a bit stuffy, but come on. We've gotten this far, we can go all the way. What do you say, Mister Schmidt?" The German sighed. Weighing risk and reward, he spoke."

Here and there, he'd hear rumors and news about what was going on inside that church. Lots of negotiating and discussion happening in that place. Then, as he was preparing to grab his rifle, he heard a voice.\n\n"Ludwik!" That was Marzena. He had grown fast friends with her after hanging out together for a few months. They had come from the same factory, after all, and led to the same place after they were let go. Ludwik let out a groan and turned to face her. "Yeah?"\n\n"News from the church! The German and the Reichsbanner have negotiated." Ludwik rolled his eyes. "You sound like a machine," he said, and Marzena looked a bit annoyed, but still undeterred.\n\n"Apparently, they're going to allow elections in Poland now. There's just a bit of a problem, however." Ludwik felt both tense and happy. What was the problem going to be? "Well, go on." He said. "What's the bad news?"\n\nMarzena grimaced. "They're only allowing fascists and people friendly to fascists to be elected." Immediately, Ludwik's morale began sapping. "So it's practically a show. Great... here I thought the Nazis would actually let me vote for someone who wasn't a loyal dog to Germania."\n\nMarzena didn't look too happy herself. "I mean... cheer up?"

It would've been a full eight hours, too, had some trouble maker not decided to come through the barracks and start making noise.\n\nGroggily rolling over to her back, her eyes slowly opened and her ears attuned themselves back into the land of the living. What she heard was shouting at first, which shot her nerves and made her jump out of bed, eyes wide as she began scrambling for her pistol before realizing that this wasn't a panicked shout. It was something else.\n\nWhen she exited her room and went to where she was hearing it - the mess hall - it began becoming clearer. "THEY DID IT! REICHSBANNER DID IT!" He, whoever he was, shouted. Standing at the door of the mess hall, she could see that there were a couple dozen soldiers who all paid attention to him. "Men and women, I've just been told by someone that Brandt convinced that German bastard to allow elections in Lithuania! Not only that, but everywhere else, too! We can finally get the damn Nazi boot off our necks- i-it's not much, but it's a step forward!"\n\nThere was an aura of silence that suddenly overcame the room. Everyone - Aušra especially - was processing the words he had just said. Democracy in Europe? What sort of nebulous concept was that? It was silly enough to make Aušra smile in contempt- but when she heard one man clap and another man whistle, and a woman start cheering and another start laughing, she instinctively reached to clap her hands together herself, smile turning from contempt and mockery to a genuine sense of relief.

It was only an hour in, when they knew that they were nearing their parting destinations, when Brandt spoke up. It caught Schmidt off-guard, as he himself was deep within the confines of his own thoughts, so as he stirred himself to attention and turned to face the man, he was already continuing.\n\n"I suppose I should let you know. Not that it is wise of me to do so, but... well, I've already started, haven't I?" Schmidt leaned against the tinted window, waiting. Brandt looked to have traces of nervousness rise in his throat - and both men were surprised, Schmidt more so. "I'm... going to flee to the U.S. I thought I should let you know. I cannot assist you in Germania or elsewhere. All that would net me would be a hanging. A shame, but... at least Reichsbanner has done its duty."\n\nSchmidt gave a slow, understanding nod. "I suppose I can admit something to you, too, my friend." Brandt let out a quiet, amused chuckle at 'friend', but his frown did not turn up. "I don't know what's going to happen.. Something tells me... if I come home, to Berlin, I will see that Speer has gone mad, and that it will all end there. Then it will truly be the last days of Europe. Maybe it's my growing paranoia."\n\nBrandt stayed silent for the next few seconds, contemplating his words. Then he spoke. "Herr Schmidt... think it over again. Are you so certain that everything you have done is for naught?" Schmidt felt the anxiety creep up his mind. "Tell me," Brandt began, his eyes turning to gaze into the other man's own, and he looked at Schmidt with an utmost sense of clarity. "I want your answer to be the most honest it can be. Not just with me - but also with yourself. What do you feel?"\n\nHelmut Schmidt caught the initial wave of impulsiveness in his throat; throwing all but one emotion into the back of his head, he then spoke."

So bad that he was starting to feel sick, but now was no time to take a vacation. Schmidt had to push through to the end. Even if it meant pushing through the meeting that Speer had called him to.\n\nLight-headed and feeling weak, Schmidt stepped into Speer's office. He was already sitting there, palms clasped against each other, fingers interlocked neatly as if he had been there for hours, waiting for just the right person to arrive - and, by the look on Speer's face, he had just received his visitor. "Herr Schmidt. I'm glad you've arrived. I won't ask you to take a seat, simply that I've been wanting to tell you something. Ever since you forced my hand to abolish the Nuremberg laws-" Why did he go? Why didn't he call in sick? "-there is, currently, nothing necessarily allowing for discrimination against a man of the Jewish race."\n\nSpeer was an old, worn-out man, and yet the energy he gave was much younger and much brighter. As if he was calling to something from the past. His smile widened slightly as he looked over Schmidt's face. "What is the problem, Helmut Schmidt? Go on. Co-operation between me and the Gang of Four has always been crucial to our survival these past two decades, has it not? Go on, Herr Schmidt. What is the problem?"\n\nIt was as if Schmidt was staring into the face of madness. He resisted the urge to run, as his legs tightened and he felt it so difficult to breathe properly, and he had a deathly want to avoid having the sweat form on his brow. "Nothing." A lie. "My Führer. There is nothing wrong."\n\nSpeer gave a nod. "That's very good. In that case, I figure that you already know what I'm going to ask of you, but, it's been long, long overdue. In fact, it's strange how I never..." He gave a short chuckle. "How I never thought of it in the first place. All I wish to do is one thing, going forward with our partnership.""

He did not know what to expect when he walked through that main door into the building. Many thoughts popped into his head. Most of them were a mixture between unpleasant and gruesome, leaning towards the latter. But Schmidt couldn't worry himself forever - he had to continue.\n\nSo when Schmidt entered the Reichskanzlei and stepped into the long, glossy hallway, the lights from the patterned glass above shone down into the room and illuminated none other than Albert Speer. Next to him were what he immediately recognized as members of the Ordnungspolizei. Schmidt almost mistook the skip of his heartbeat as a heart attack.\n\n"Herr Schmidt." His tone was a casual one, but Schmidt couldn't mistake the intention. It was as if Speer was the one in control here. "I'm ordering your immediate arrest. I suggest you do not flee." He was pressed into going on the backfoot. To turn and run - no, things were different now. It was no longer the Führer who had his strings attached everywhere he went. The situation had changed.\n\nHelmut Schmidt shook his heads, and the Ordnungspolizei stopped moving towards him, standing halfway between Speer and Schmidt. "I'm afraid not, my Führer." He could already see the hatred begin to burn brighter in his eyes, and how his hands began trembling. "There will be no arrest. You should be aware that there is absolutely no reason why this order should be carried out. Do you have a reason, my Führer? You do not need one to arrest me, but you and I both know that doing so would cause your support to turn on you." Speer's whole body began shaking, and he breathed heavily.\n\n"Schmidt... for all these years..." With an unsteady hand, Speer reached into the coat he was wearing, and Schmidt's eyes widened. "I made sure to empty out the Reichskanzlei today. Just..."\n\n"No!" Schmidt shouted, and the Ordnungspolizei turned around, themselves spiking in fear as they saw the Führer draw a pistol.\n\n"Just s-so I could kill you."\n\n"SPEER!""

Such a vigorous conversation it was - Schmidt found himself enthralled by all the information that Brandt had about it. Such a noble organization - in his mind, at least - stomped into the ground by the NSDAP, and then fading into irrelevance; and then, like a flash, it ruptured from its grave and returned as a major power, going head to head with Germany itself to negotiate the terms of freedom. Yet Schmidt had disappointed Brandt.\n\n"What is it, Brandt?"\n\nThey discussed the matters of protesting, too. Both men were in agreement about how important it was to showcase that the nation did allow itself to display that the people were free, that they had a voice. But what Schmidt differed from Brandt was how to go about it. Brandt scrutinized Schmidt for a while after they came to terms, to determine if he truly believed that the time for protesting was a transformation, a process that had to be carefully managed, or was it something else?\n\n"Are you a coward?"\n\nSchmidt felt the question was like a dagger pressed to his heart. He knew that Brandt had wanted to press him, but this... being so blunt and so direct contrasted the previous, friendly nature that the man had shown him. Doubt coursed through his mind, and as Brandt stared at him with that same look he gave after Schmidt offered his suggestion of a compromise, words failed him momentarily. What was dry air that came out of his mouth was then replaced by what he would call a realization. After nigh ten seconds of silence, Schmidt spoke."

So many of them armed with weapons that dated back to the Second World War, and though he could spot a few that carried guns which were likely stolen from armories or taken from the hands of the local guards, it was like watching a ragtag group of rebels rather than anything that resembled a proper army. And while so many looked sad, bitter, depressed, even - so many more were happy, overjoyed, clinking glasses with one another and sitting around and sharing stories, tales, poems, confessions.\n\n"Schmidt..." The slurred voice of Willy Brandt alerted Schmidt to his presence, and he turned his head to see the revolutionary smile tiredly towards him. "I'm... glad you listened." The shot glass in his hand was unsteady as he dangled it over the edge of the church's top floor. Then Brandt turned from looking at Schmidt to looking at the city. "I was w-worried, frankly, that- well, no need to bring your spirits down. You want a drink, Schmidt?" A distinct lack of 'Herr', but neither man seemed to mind.\n\nHesitance painted his words. "... Sorry, Herr Brandt. Not much of a drinker. I'm also a diplomat, and diplomats should probably lay off the alcohol," he said, pointedly giving a half-serious glare towards Brandt, who looked at him with a smile that cracked into grin after a few seconds. Schmidt himself eventually gave a smirk.\n\n"Quit staring at me like that, Schmidt, it's-" He gave out a short laugh. "Stop!" Schmidt could feel his own lips quivering, and, perhaps to save face or just to listen to Brandt's demands, he turned away before he succumbed to Brandt finding it funny. "You know, Schmidt... you might still be a Nazi in the eyes of the people, but to me, you're... you're a better man than anyone in Germania's high castle."\n\nSchmidt suddenly felt a pang of embarrassment. A strong fear and source of doubt kept pulling at his consciousness - that he would be cast down into the annals of history as a traitor and a Nazi. Maybe it was true; maybe, once he finally died and fulfilled his role, his role would be that of a forgotten soldier. But if at least one person knew, just one, then..."

For the sake of 'stability' and 'diversifying the strengths of National Socialism'. Vague nothingness like that. He felt the slightest bit of irritation, but, what could he do? Though he had his fair share of connections, nothing could stand up to Speer's decision.\n\nLudwig Erhard groaned when he had read the letter that arrived at his table. Speer's antics had cropped up once more. Now he was to be the co-Minister of Economics and Labor. What nonsense was this?

Germany's territorial expansion bloomed - so much territory, so densely packed, so rich with people, industry and resources, it filled him with a sense of joy, that the Reich truly was the dominator of Europe.\n\nBut the Gang of Four had forced his hand into doing something that he was never truly satisfied with. The Reichskommissariats were an inefficient thing, a product of a past era - riddled with corruption and slavery. He could understand the concerns of some with the concept of the Reichsländer, but to Speer, the idea was such that he couldn't possibly pass it by. Direct subjects of the Reich, with a vague semblance of freedom; while they would never officially undergo the process of Germanization, seeing that it was well and truly too expensive and risky of a process, they would still be influenced by German civilization.\n\nThat night Speer had decided. The collaborationists had to go. The natives wouldn't be pleased with it, and he would have to make it a slow process, but he knew, in his heart, that this would be better for all.

He found it beautiful, yes, but there were so many other things that had occupied his time that he could not spare a visit to it. Now, however, he felt at ease. When Adolf Hitler had died, his body had been transported to Germania and been given a proper burial and a memorial service even as the civil war had raged on - but Speer, with his personal funds, and over the course of the decade, had asked, petitioned, and convinced for the body of Hitler to be moved to Linz. His love of the city was strong, and in turn, so was Speer's.\n\nNot only that, however. His body did not deserve to be in a mere grave to rot. Instead, Speer had built a mausoleum for his predecessor, and he had meticulously planned every inch of it. As he stood in front of the tomb that housed his paternal figure, he smiled. Everything about it was right. All the details, the vaguely religious yet still National Socialist elements that covered the inside. Perhaps, in a way, this was his greatest work yet - barring Germania, of course.\n\nBut he hadn't come merely to admire his own architectural genius. No, there was something more. There was a man he had respected for as long as he had lived, and now he had passed. Yet Speer never truly gave him the proper respect he deserved. For without him, there would be no Reich to begin with - but without Speer, the Reich would not have survived. As he kneeled in front of the tomb, he uttered no prayer, he made no motion of bowing to a deity. Instead, his was a silent admiration of the highest degree.\n\nEverything Albert Speer had learned from his father was now passed on to him, yet reshaped, moulded to serve the rapidly-changing future. Would he have understood it? Speer wouldn't know; but he would have respected him. For now there was no need to play nice with the enemies of the Reich. Power was his, and no other's. He was the NSDAP, and the NSDAP was his. A sort of tingling pride was felt in him, a sensation that he was, as treacherous as it would have been to say, an even better leader than he who had guided him all those years.

Wouldn't you all agree?"\n\nSchmidt didn't seem fully pleased with Kiesinger wanting to cut it short, but, eventually he had to give in. Perhaps his mind needed some rest - perhaps he didn't have to think about everything at once for a few hours."

 speerphase3.8.t:0 "Better The Devil You Know"
 speerphase3.8.desc:0 "In Weimar there was a conference, all meeting in secret. They were the Gang of Four, and men who represented the fledgeling democratic movement in Germany; of the numerous there, three stood out. Richard von Weizsäcker, Günter Grass and Axel Springer. Though their political differences ranged from mild to severe, they all shared a unified goal. A free Germany, rid of Nazi ideology - and what would have been a long, in-depth conversation in secrecy had its bearings shattered and torn out when a certain someone made an unexpected visit.\n\n"I have seen your efforts, dear friends of mine," Hermann Josef Abs spoke, standing in the doorway as seven faces stared at him, a mix of fear, worry, and shock. Abs locked eyes with Erhard, who seemed positively disgusted, and he gave a sharp smile. "If you are concerned that I am here because of the destruction of IG Farben, have no worry. My interests are much more than a mere slavedriver company in Germany. I have something far more valuable that remains, and shall remain, fully untouched. It is, however, something I can offer you all."\n\nErhard's hand shook, and he was tempted to slam it on the table, to demand that he get out. Yet Schmidt's voice cut through the air, and his tone was much more neutral, if not even interested. "Herr Erhard has made me aware that your main shareholder is Deutsche Bank. Is that your 'something' you are referring to?"\n\nAbs nodded, taking a step into the room. "National Socialism is dying. The NSDAP doesn't understand that, but you all do. The writing on the wall is obvious, my friends. With power in your hands, I expect you all to begin the push for a Germany that sheds its old, egregiously brutal skin for something new and more humane." Erhard resigned himself into angered yet horrified silence. "And you know what, Herr Schmidt?""

 speerphase3.9.desc:0 ""Can you hear me right, Ludwig? Ludwig... ?"\n\nA second or two of silence before he responded. "Yes, Helmut, I can hear you. Barely. Where are you? It sounds like you're in a phone booth. Actually, no, don't answer that question, I can tell you're in a phone booth, as your office in the Reichskanzlei doesn't sound like it's crammed with vehicles buzzing their horns all the time. Anyways- I've had a realization today."\n\nSchmidt furrowed his eyebrows. "Really now? A realization? Ludwig, you said that this was important-"\n\n"Because it is!" He cut in, giving a sigh. "You remember Kurt's plan with the Reichsländers? A stupid thing. Just to appease Speer. Well, now that doesn't matter anymore. We don't need to mock the natives by installing Germans or Nazi collaborators as well as barely lifting the restrictions they had during the time of the Reichskommissariats. Things must change, Helmut. We need to get rid of this relic of the past - give it something new."\n\n"... then..." Schmidt bit his lip for a moment. He was right - they couldn't stick to the policies that were there just to bend the knee to the hardliners of the NSDAP. All it would do was prolong the inevitable. "... call the other members of the Gang. We'll have to discuss this in detail, preferably today. I agree to your proposal, Ludwig. I just need to gather my thoughts. We'll meet again soon."\n\nThe message to Erhard was clear. With an invisible nod, Erhard spoke. "Alright. I will see you soon, Helmut.""

 speerphase3.10.t:0 "End of a New Beginning"
 speerphase3.10.desc:0 "Here he was again. Helmut Schmidt had been to so many places, yet he had rarely ever visited his own city of Hamburg. His birthplace, his sacred home. Perhaps he was afraid of coming back to it and to be swallowed in its memories, as then and even now, there was no time to afford for traces of weakness. But things had changed. Things were different now. As Schmidt walked through the rich morning of the city, where his eyes would have focused on vain, oversized Nazi banners were residents in apartments living out their daily lives; where he would see soldiers patrolling the streets, there were men and women fighting for a better Germany. Raising the banner of freedom, to voice their anger in protests that shook the city's peace.\n\nThe city was no longer familiar to Schmidt, but nostalgia still pulled him inwards. Hitler and his regime had built it up in such a way that even when he had visited Barmbek, the old village where he spent his childhood days, there was barely anything that resembled what he had known for two decades, and he had walked through it like he would have any other district. There was one place, however, that would remain unchanged - and it was just next to Barmbek.\n\nThe Außenalster always remained the same. He knew the Nazis couldn't have tainted its water. Somewhere along the coast, Schmidt had stood at the edge of the water and stared as all the sailing boats passed. He remembered being on one with his father as a child, demanding to go back in and loop around when they were done. Now there were so many others. People, sometimes alone and sometimes together, and sometimes with their children, enjoying themselves in a way that was now alien to him. Yet the air was so much lighter now. Ten years since Schmidt had entered into the dark tunnel, the light had begun to pour in. So much fear, so much anxiety, contrasted by the serenity of the peace that he felt while in Hamburg.\n\nSchmidt looked down at his arm. That bright, burning reminder that seared his flesh and assaulted his mind whenever he looked at it. The armband he wore that was a constant reminder that he deserved to be afraid, deserved to die. But no more would he force himself to follow the orders of a mad man. He had done what many could never do. He did not feel prideful for it, as a man who dodges a death sentence would feel proud about avoiding the inevitable. Instead, as his fingers tugged under the fabric, and it slid across his arm, he felt relief. Sheer, unmitigated relief.\n\nWhen the armband slipped from his wrist and slid against and out from the grasp of his fingers and landed in the water with a silent thump, Schmidt breathed. Everything felt so much clearer than it did before. He could finally live. His judge, jury, and executioner would never pursue him again. But there was work to do, and so Schmidt turned around and began walking. He knew what he had to do."

 speerphase3.11.desc:0 "The German Reich has found itself at a standstill. As it has begun the process of opening up, it has similarly undergone a transformation. It is no longer an economy that maintains stark autarky and hostile, almost war-like relations with the other superpower. Instead it has unlatched itself from its old ways and now floats aimlessly in this new world, attempting to cling on to both the past as a giant who conquered Europe and beat back the imperialist world powers, and the present, as a dove wishing to extend the olive branch, either out of a sense of good will, or sheer pragmatism.\n\nOur new order cannot shift and ebb and be so fluid as it was before. If it is to become the rock that will bear the coming storm, Germany cannot be everchanging. It must steady itself - it must not rock the boat, and it must find its way forwards. There is no more time to bicker between the debates of the many sides in our country; a way is put, the path is clear, and we need only go down it."

They existed only to expand their influence and combat their enemies, as peace was hardly seen as a viable alternative in the years following Germany's glorious triumph. Yet now, decades later, we see that there is something new brewing.\n\nThe Oil Crisis has struck the world as a knife to exposed flesh. It has exploited the weakness found in all of the blocs that encompass the world, every superpower attempting to take it on by themselves, only to find that such a course of action is not only inefficient, but actively detrimental.\n\nAlong with it, the revolt of the slaves has shown Germany that it cannot stand alone. We have made token efforts to appease the other two superpowers, true, but it is finally time for the Reich to stand together in full earnest with the rest. The Einheitspakt cannot be solely Germany and its puppets. It can be more. For the good of the world, it must be."

With the intensive modernizations of China, they are rapidly beginning to climb to the status of a co-equal partner within the Sphere. An insight into Japanese politics tells us that there is heavy friction about the idea that China could ever possibly be anything more than a puppet to the Sphere, and thus their internal stability is beginning to fall.\n\nIt's advised to pursue stronger diplomatic and trade relations with the Organization of Free Nations - particularly the U.S. The state of their internal politics is much stronger than that of Japan, and they have a massive and still growing economy that we could expand our interests into, as well as having a large surplus of raw and refined goods. Also, China is a nation with a vast, untapped population, industrial potential, and common outlook. Advised to form interests with them as well.

In this new era, our nations have prospered. But a new problem has developed. As the world has grown richer, more connected with each other, we now run the risk of collapse. The Oil Crisis struck not only Germany, but the world as a whole, and it has ripped open a hole we never thought had existed before.\n\nThe Greater Germanic Reich proposes that a new organization be formed. One that would have the intent of safeguarding peace across the planet, as war only serves to further destroy the economies of the nations affected. It would also serve as a way to bring all of our nations closer - think of it as global cooperation. The name of it is simple; the Koalition der Nationen. Currently there are no concrete plans to establish one, but the Reich has shown a keen interest in the idea. We ask you this:\n\nAre you of the same mind?"

He never truly was a fan of war. It was a costly affair. A glorious one, you could say, but look where it led the reich to. Men like Bormann, men like Göring...\n\nMen like Heydrich.\n\nSpeer shuddered. What visceral carnage they would have wrought upon the Reich. They were long gone now, however. Only phantoms. And with the Gang of Four out of his way, and the NSDAP following his will and his voice, he would make the finishing touches to his precious Reich - his final test, that came not in the form of a revolt, or dealing with dissent. It came as a goal to secure the future of the Thousand Year Reich.\n\nThe Koalition der Nationen transcended all of his previous architectural goals. Germania would be merely a backdrop in comparison as to what will come. Albert Speer's will was powerful, and after having dealt with the brunt of the Reich's issues all at once, he pulled out victorious. This time, however, he would have to cement his legacy forever. The KdN in Speer's mind would not only certify Germany's dominion over Europe.\n\nIt would seat them as the leader of the world.

We should be working as close as possible to get a theoretical framework of what a Koalition would look like, make certain to the other two superpowers that it would be worth their time joining. However..." Kiesinger let a second or two of silence pass before he continued. "Herr Speer, Helmut. He's a volatile element."\n\nAs Schmidt took in his words, he momentarily closed his eyes and thought. Then, he shook his head. "No," he began with a sigh. "Speer is quite the stable substance, I would say." Kiesinger looked at him with suspicion, but Schmidt's in return glowed with confidence. "I have seen him at his very worst, Kurt. He is nothing but a hollow shell of a man. He is a liar, a coward, a thief, and an architect of nothing but murder. To name any positive traits about him would be deluding myself. To your eyes, that would make him unstable. But to me..." Schmidt turned around in his chair and looked to the window outside. "He is the perfect puppet."\n\nKiesinger froze up for a moment. He hadn't expected the man who grazed death under the presence of the Führer to so openly denigrate him. "So you have no worries, then. I see. A question, however." Schmidt made no motion to decline answering. "Would you dare say this all to his face? If he is such a weak puppet, then you would get away with doing so."\n\nSchmidt's stoic frown cracked, and he gave a small smile.

speerescalation.4.t:0 "Garmr Has Broken Free"
speerescalation.4.desc:0 "Germany's forefathers, the norse Aryans of the North, believed that one day Götterdämmerung, or Ragnarök, would envelop the world. The first sign of this end of days would be when a great Wolf, Garmr, broke free from his chains and was set loose. Following this, countryman would turn on countryman. Brother on brother. Earth would be torn asunder. \n\nHe had left it too late. He had not put Garmr back in chains. No, he had been a fool. An idiot, all things considered. That devil in the east, Schörner, was a rabid dog in every sense of the word. Foul, vicious and savage. Speer knew that when an animal goes feral, there is only one humane choice, for it and for all around it: putting the dog down. Yet he hadn't. Out of some fear, or stupid sympathy, or pure idiocy, Speer had led the dog roam free. Now, he had to endure the reports as they came in, live through that newfangled television of his. \n\nMurder. Massacre. Wholesale slaughter of slaves in the East. Was this Speer in the mirror? Was Schörner just a reflection of the great architect? When he looked at the white marble of Germania, would Speer see anything in his own artistry but the bloodied tapestry of sinews that the Generalfeldmarschall had constructed across the Reichskommissariats? And it was a tapestry. Slavic bodies flung carelessly around. Mass graves dug. Who knows how many thousands more will be killed in the coming weeks? Schörner had what he wanted. The dog was putting his master down. \n\nHe had lost. Now, he would be a Führer only in name. With the students nearing rebellion, the slaves openly revolting, and Speer's underlings turning against him, he felt his dreams disappear. He stood up from his desk, and stood in front of one of the many bookshelves of the Kanzler's office. The Poetic Edda stood out to him. He smiled, with a hint of melancholy. How fitting. He turned to stanza forty-five, and read aloud, alone in the room. \n\n"Brothers shall fight and fell each other, \nand sister's sons shall kinship stain. \nHard is it on earth, with mighty whoredom. \nAxe-time, sword-time, shields are sundered, \nWind-time, wolf-time, 'ere the world falls.""

speerescalation.7.t:0 "Looking Forwards"
speerescalation.7.desc:0 "As a man endures his sixties, he begins to ponder his life. In Germany, most men retire during this twilight decade, putting down the hammers and quills and moving into a life of family and comfort. The free men do, anyway.\n\nKurt's father had been a free man. For him, sixty was only the two-thirds checkpoint in his life, and he lived a happy final third with the wealth of a bank clerk. A shining example of the protestant work ethic, and a reaper of its rewards. He'd only died recently, Kurt remembered. Was it just last year? Time seemed a blur nowadays.\n\nKurt wasn't a man built for retirement. If time was a blur, his duty was not. With the Führer occupied in Moskowien, the student protests continued to cripple the heart of the Reich, and the old Silver Tongue was not about to let the opportunity for a reformed Germany descend into chaos and violence so quickly. Fingers drum on the table as the Deputy Führer stares coldly into middle distance, listening. The sound of a phone being picked up, and Kiesinger begins.\n\n"These lines are not secure, so I shall keep it brief. You know the location already. Where the griffin flies and the seas are sweet with trade. Next Thursday, be at the pier. Let us keep this brief." \n\nAnd like that, Kiesinger hung up the phone. His suitcase for an overnight stay had already been prepared in his room. A plane for Rostock had been organised, and if the Führer couldn't quell the Devil, then his Deputy would have to make a pact himself."
speerescalation.7.a:0 "A truce to terror."

speerescalation.9.t:0 "House of Cards"
speerescalation.9.desc:0 "To Erhard, it appeared as if the house of cards was finally collapsing. Was Speer more tolerable than the Nazi scum before him? Of course. Was his demise in any way an upset to the Minister for the Economy? Not in the slightest. As the Führer's crisis continued to worsen, the man behind the facade of kindness and polite diplomacy had shrunk away, and the demon that Erhard had always seen behind those glassy eyes and forced smiles had reared its ugly head. Unfortunately for Ludwig, the time was not yet right for him and his allies to wrestle a true liberal democracy out of the ruins of the Reich.\n\nIn this sense, the student protests had seemed a tragedy to him. Slavery, tyranny, state control; all valid causes to rally against, and ideals he sympathised with. This particular outburst at the obvious violence of the regime Erhard was forced to collaborate with and the slave uprisings shook the economic minister to his core. Behind his crassness, he had a heart. In front of his crassness, Erhard cringed at the economic stupidity of this Nazi institution and the untold prosperity it had denied Germany.\n\nFor now, Erhard did need to calm the students. Their violent responses, although understandable, were ultimately a hindrance to the obtaining of genuine reform in the Reich. His political invulnerability would be his weapon.\n\nCalls were made, and meetings arranged. Erhard had sent his sympathies out through the protests, spreading rumours that he, and others within the government, were allied with them in the struggle for reform. By dispelling this information secretly, Erhard was gambling on the news not being traced back to him, and that if it was, his importance to the Reich might guarantee immunity from punishment. In time, however, this regime and all it stood for would be erased."

speerescalation.11.t:0 "A New Deal"
speerescalation.11.desc:0 "Germania was called the Welthauptstadt for a reason. If Tokyo, sprawling metropolis of the isles to the East, was the capital of an Empire, then Germania in its size and magnificence was the capital of the world. The massive projects and renovations of old Berlin, and especially the expansion into a surrounding urban sprawl, gave the city plenty of hiding spots, however. The larger a house is, the harder it is to clean, and the dirty corners of the Reichs basement saw little light throughout the decades.\n\nHelmut entered an alley in a local downtown area of Germania's surrounding suburbs. He was dressed quite carefully in a black leather coat over a dark brown jumper. A fedora adorned his head and he wore dark eye glasses, not tinted enough to suggest sunglasses at midnight but not light enough to see his eyes. The outfit was a precautionary measure against the foreign minister being identified in the outer suburbs of his home city. \n\nTwo other men and a woman were already in the alley. They were young, and even in the cover of night, their clothes told their age. Effortful. Jazzy. American. Even as a liberal, Helmut grimaced at the sight.\n\n"Finally. What have you got for us, old man," the woman began. \n\n"Naught but a promise, I'm afraid," Helmut responded. "I cannot get you what you want now, but I can guarantee it comes in due time." \n\n"What kind of a deal is that?" The men tensed, an effort to threaten the aging statesman. \n\n"A deal you'll have to take, my dear, if you want anything done in this wretched country." Schmidt revealed a note from his pocket. "This is the address of a cache of weapons I redirected from some friends in the Heer. They're not for use in some violent rebellion; I want you to know I am on your side and will defend you from this police state I have found myself in. There's more where they come from, when the time comes, but for now I need you to lower tensions and engage in talks with the state. It is the only choice."\n\nThe woman grimaced, but nodded. "Thank you, Herr Schmidt.""
speerescalation.11.a:0 "All in due time."

speerescalation.13.t:0 "Wisdom"
speerescalation.13.desc:0 "Hegel, as a young man, described Napoleon entering the city of Jena as the 'world's soul on horseback'. The man was a hero, despite his crimes, and burned with the energy and charisma that galvanised his country behind him. It seemed to Hegel as if history itself had volunteered for his army. If the philosopher had been a young man today, a student on the sidelines of Frankfurt's protests, perhaps he would have had some similar esteem for the world soul arriving in an armoured car instead. \n\nVon Tresckow arrived in the city with the Orpo. He wore his military uniform that day, iron cross and all, with a furred coat over the top. An imperial elegance held to the Old Prussian. He had not come to fight, he had come to talk. \n\nOver the past few years, Von Tresckow had used his time to reform the police. Primarily, this involved reallocating resources away from weaponry, reducing their numbers, revising tactics and educational programs. Perceptions of Germany's Prussian tradition often confuse traditionalism and patriotism with militarism and dogmatism. Von Tresckow knew that the military and nation were central to a German identity, but they were a restrained force of honour and valor meant to protect freedom, not crush it. \n\nHe was to be an ambassador. Schmidt might have dealt well in foreign embassies, but Von Tresckow had always felt a bond with all common people. These protestors were no different. \n\nAs the Orpo began to form a wall around the students, they screamed in the officers face. This was an expected activity, and the police stood firm, but calm, as they had been trained to do. When Von Tresckow was spotted amongst their ranks, the face of Germany's security ministry became the target of even more verbal abuse. He understood their anger, and despite the protests of some of his own men, he stepped beyond the police barrier into the crowd. \n\n"Germans, gather round. I come not to make war, I come not to preach the Nazi ideal. I came to make peace, I came to listen to the people. So, brothers and sisters, speak." \n\nAnd so they did, until the final of the sun's rays died on the horizon."
