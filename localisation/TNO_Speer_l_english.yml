 POLITICS_SPEER_GERMANY_DESC:0 "Many things are said of Albert Speer, yet none can deny his ambition.\n\nUnlike many others, he did not join the NSDAP that fateful day in 1931 for the late Führer's fiery rhetoric. It was Adolf Hitler's calm and collected speech given during a rally in Berlin that intoxicated the young architect, leading him to join the Party the year after.\n\nWhat started as a favor to a fellow member became a recommendation to Joseph Goebbels; the recommendation became a commission to renovate the local NSDAP headquarters. Before long, he had drawn the personal interest of the Führer. Hitler became a passionate admirer of his vision, and together they drafted plans of a new Germany.\n\nBy the war's end, Speer was a close friend of the Führer, presided over his own ministry and touted a reputation as the man who transformed the Reich's economy into a war-winning machine. No matter the cost of life, the dream of a new Germany had been realized. Reputation is rarely truth - but he made sure that everyone knew of his.\n\nIt was in the midst of Germania's construction that the economy crashed, and his lofty dreams with it. Pinning the blame was easy. Slavery, the very system Speer created to win the war, doomed Germany in peace. It was an unprecedented disaster - one that Speer could not ignore. The Reich and Volk deserved greatness. His dreams deserved reality. Reform was necessary.\n\nYears of open criticism of NSDAP policy followed, and he soon found himself somewhere unexpected once again: as the figurehead of the largest reform movement Germany had seen in decades. Speer's ambitious goals and reputation as a dissenter enveloped countless of young dreamers and old rivals around him in a political maelstrom unlike any other.\n\nAnd as he now walks this perilous tightrope he crafted, he balances not only his own future but also that of the Reich."

 POLITICS_NATSOC_SPEER_DESC:0 "There was a time where Albert Speer could stand in front of a podium on a crowd of thousands and speak words that would get any normal German man ousted as a traitor, and shot for cowardice and Bolshevism. Of course, he never was committed to most of what he had said, merely words spoken to rile up his base and strengthen his support. Yet Albert Speer overestimated his prowess, and underestimated the hardliners.\n\nWhat fate awaited him at the hands of the Gang of Four was now merely a passing thought. His worries of being a puppet to the liberalistic whims of the students seemed almost like paranoia now, as he follows the orders of Theodor Oberländer and his clique in the NSDAP. His image as the 'reformer' of the Reich has dissolved, and all the remains is a man whose vision has been stomped underfoot by the degeneration of National Socialist ideology.\n\nThere are no more days where Albert Speer can smile and think to himself that he is building a new Reich, for the new German man. Now he follows orders and attempts to slow the grinding crusher that will tear his ideology into pieces. He cannot imagine that Adolf Hitler would look at him and consider his achievements worthy of respect.\n\nNot anymore."

 POLITICS_FASH_SPEER_DESC:0 "No longer was Albert Speer merely the architectural genius behind many of Hitler's grandiose plans. No longer was Albert Speer the Minister of Armaments and War Production during Germany's finest hour. He was not the side-character who pulled Germany out of failure when it sunk to its depths before he took the reins. No longer was Albert Speer the political webspinner and silver tongue that got a loose alliance of vaguely-loyal liberals and yesmen to back him as he spun an image of being a reformist force. Albert Speer was no longer the "good" National Socialist.\n\nHe is its true form.\n\nThe slave revolt was his final test. In his mind, it was what would make or break him as the true Führer of the Thousand Year Reich, and he succeeded. He thanks Reinhard Gehlen for preventing him from acting out his worst impulses, even if his usefulness has outlived him - as Helmut Schmidt attempted to steer him into becoming a puppet, Speer's anger grew and grew until it boiled over. Then with the help of Gehlen, he had saved himself. Now he will determine the future of Germany's people, as the rightful heir to the throne Adolf Hitler had left behind. As for the Gang?\n\nTheir fates were in his hands, and Albert Speer was not a merciful man. He would pass out his judgement to each one.\n\nStarting with Helmut Schmidt."

 POLITICS_AUTHDEM_SPEER_DESC:0 "National Socialism has failed. It has failed all of the challenges it has met, and it is now doomed to extinction... and who is to blame?\n\nAlbert Speer finds himself with daggers pointed everywhere around him, but he knows that it is the NSDAP that has ruined him; the liberals that have degraded the moral fiber of German society; the communists with their Jewish propaganda pulling their strings and threatening to corrupt his ideology. He wishes for the will to continue fighting for a better Germany, but he has been sapped of it all. Most days he spends staring blankly in his office, absent-mindedly shuffling paper after paper, knowing that the power of the Führer is now merely a ploy. Sometimes he thinks back on men like Heydrich. Perhaps there was a silver lining in his words.\n\nAnd Helmut Schmidt is the worst offender of them all. He is the reflection in the mirror that stares back at him with the mocking smile. He is everything that represents the collapse of the Aryan man, yet he has won out, and without men like Speer, there is only one path to go down.\n\nAlbert Speer has failed. He has failed all of the challenges he has met, and he is now doomed to misery... and who is to blame?"

Yet even the mightiest of leaders need associates, friends... and loyal servants.

Wishing to rectify the situation, the Führer has accepted the recommendations of his subordinates and will shortly announce a formal victory parade, to be held in Nuremberg.

The Rhineland's slaves will be reorganized into the 'Führer's Own' Loyal Labor Divisions; they will be granted better housing, higher-quality rations, less oversight and can expect particularly favorable treatment when the time comes to implement the Führer's labor reforms.

Radicalism aside, Erhard has the Führer's full confidence and is about as popular as an economist could ever hope to be with the populace, owing to his concrete evidence for the wisdom of Speer's economic reforms.\n\nErhard is also a man with a plan - or several. He has spoken in the past of abolishing price controls, constraining inflation, opening up foreign markets, and even abolishing slavery outright in order to give Germans more employment opportunities!

Immensely popular and astonishingly successful, the RAD reduced the unemployment rate to nearly zero and instilled proper working-class values in an entire generation of disillusion and profligate young men.\n\nErhard, despite his dislike of orthodox National Socialist economics, knows a good idea when he sees one. The RAD will live once more - this time, under the new title of 'Trümmertruppen'. These new labor divisions will carry out work that would otherwise be allocated to slaves, thereby fulfilling Speer's promise of reducing unemployment, at least in the short-term.

These would be ad-hoc polytechnic institutes, set up to provide youths and the chronically unemployed with the training necessary to take up blue-collar works, while giving them a good dose of military discipline and patriotic indoctrination in the process.\n\nErhard is not over-enthused with this notion, but the Führer is concerned that placing such a massive responsibility on his shoulders might lead to serious complications should his plans fail.

Equally limiting to our progress is the NSDAP's ideological stranglehold on science. Ever since the decision was made to reject 'Jewish' physics in the 1930s, we have been out of step with the rest of the world.

Not to mention the tremendous rumblings that would occur among National Socialism's faithful masses with such a great deviation from Hitler's tried-and-true economic policies.\n\nErhard will not be pleased, but the Führer knows best. It would be more sensible from a popular and patriotic standpoint to instead institute a contractionary monetary policy to throttle inflation and begin slowly reeling it back. This will give our people time to adjust - not just to their 'fortunes' becoming worth less, but also to the responsibility of living a more fruitful and luxurious lifestyle.

Unfortunately, the headiness of victory made us incautious, and we may have forgotten the value of unfixed prices.\n\nErhard now wishes to completely abolish any and all price controls, so that the value of goods will operate under the same free-market rules as the liberal nations of the world. Hopefully our citizens will not be too alarmed by the prospect of companies and businesses being able to set their own prices.

Naturally, we had to have exemptions for the bigger corporations due to their importance in the war economy.\n\nErhard disagrees with this interpretation of history.

Monetary reforms are especially problematic, as the public in general has no knowledge of economics and doesn't understand why we need to render their savings worthless.\n\nThe Führer wishes to restrain Erhard somewhat.

An outsider to the National Socialist political system, not even Schmidt's time as a soldier in the Second World War makes him trustworthy in the eyes of the Party.\n\nLuckily for Schmidt, the Führer cares nothing for what the Party thinks. The fact is that the Reich's reputation is in the gutter thanks to the past war and the nature of our great nation. Speer's ascendance to the Führership has been welcomed around the world, but we have yet to be properly rehabilitated in the eyes of our fellow nations.

Now he will have the opportunity.

Our future success begins at home, and our neighbors must learn to trust us again before we can begin to improve our domestic situation.\n\nSchmidt believes that any European nation not under our rule is worth investing effort into. The former Triumvirate nations are particularly important, of course, but Sweden and Finland will also be key partners in our future endeavors. As part of this stage of his plan, Schmidt also wishes to make a detour to India.

Regardless of the vast distance between our respective spheres of influence, Japan seems set on having Germany as a permanent rival, no different to the United States.\n\nStill, the Führer is insistent on a policy of universal détente, which means Japan must be given a place in our diplomatic plans. Neither Speer nor Schmidt are optimistic of normalizing relations with Japan, but if such a mission were to succeed, we might ease the tension somewhat and redirect it towards the United States.

Perhaps this is for the best, as we have far more in common with them than with the Japanese. They might be corrupt plutocrats, but the Americans are still European at heart, with plenty of honest German heritage.

The reality of this cannot be denied, but they offer a truly enormous amount of military power and economic potential for us.

He is one of our most successful intelligence operatives - might this be what we need after all?\n\nDubbed 'Reichsnachrichtendienst' (Reich Intelligence Service, or RND), this proposed agency would consolidate our existing intelligence services under a single umbrella. All foreign intelligence-gathering activities would be the RND's responsibility alone, and they would also take over all high-level internal security. Lower-level Gestapo roles will be folded into the Orpo, and the Abwehr will effectively become the RND's military division.

Since the Bürgerkrieg the lands of the Danes have fallen away from our orbit, even though they border Germany proper, and changes in the situation of its government only complicates matters. As we well know, complication is the last thing Germany needs any more of.\n\nA delegation is to be sent, firstly to reestablish any temporarily abrogated governmental ties but also, more importantly, to facilitate their return to the Pakt. Though geographically the Danish lands are small, they form an important link in our connections to the Northern Sea, Scandinavia, and the wider world. It must be welcomed back into the fold."

A decorated hero of the war, Hanneken is foremostly loyal to his Vaterland and will work with us to reintegrate the Reichskommissariat to the benefit of The Reich without question. This is not a completely beneficial situation, however, as Hanneken is a noted militarist who has made his political opinions known on many occasions. If we are willing to accept his modicum of influence, he will be quite willing to work with our administration, and ultimately rejoin the Pakt."

Best is a potent administrator who led the transition from the capitalist failings of a weak Denmark into an efficient and seamless extension of Germany. Gifts like these rarely present themselves, and even though he was not universally hailed in our Reich, he will be hailed now as the savior of the Danish lands and a facilitator of Germany's return to the world stage. More fortuitous yet, with the stability his government's survival brings, Denmark will be easily brought back into the Pakt."

GER_Martinsens_Resolve_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Bürgerkrieg it would seem that the Danes seized the opportunity our predisposition has given them. Knud Børge Martinsen, a Danish collaborator who made a name for himself in the Frikorps during the occupation, took the chance and seized power for a new collaborationist government. In the wings of our administration whispers are forming of the example this sets for our other occupied territories, but is this not the exact kind of example we want the peoples of The Reich to follow? Though not a born German, Martinsen is instilled like any other with the primacy and importance of Germany's mission and will work steadfastly towards this goal. Either way, as long as they return to the Pakt what the Danes do is of little import."

Additionally,  even though Denmark was never the most volatile hotbed of rebellious activity, during the instability several seditious elements revealed themselves and were subsequently 'rectified' by Hanneken's men as well. Hanneken has begun requesting reinforcements and equipment, and with his performances so far our armament organizers can hardly approve the requests quickly enough; further military cooperation can only reap us benefits!"

More than that Best has shown considerable foresight and initiative, and has already begun cooperating with industrial interests along Northern Germany. The result of all this activity has been the notable uptick in infrastructural efficiency and production in Denmark and regions further afield in The Reich itself. By all measures it would seem Denmark's relatively small economy is creating a disproportionate impact all along our production sectors, and all these connections trace back to Best's resourcefulness."

It would seem that under the previous government he saw many areas in which concentrated liberalizations would give returns far outstripping the benefits of direct control, and his hypothesis is already beginning to prove all doubters wrong. Under the new regime, the danes are investing wholesale into the civilian sectors of Denmark's economy and is sending slight fiscal shockwaves to the rest of The Reich, kickstarting an entire economic stimulus with their newfound freedoms alone!"

GER_withdraw_german_advisors_desc:0 " The young Norwegian nation no longer has any need for German monitors in its government, and in fact is very vocally dissatisfied with their continued presence there. As our first gesture of goodwill to the young administration, we shall officially withdraw any and all German advisors and bureaucrats currently stationed in Norway."

GER_cleared_of_ideology_desc:0 "The memories of the Occupation have left the Norwegians expectedly, yet uncomfortably, averse to the ways of national socialism, and it is probably a fair assumption that the policies their leaders pursue might start to wildly deviate from our own as their government is restructured. However, Norway's potential services to us are too great to abandon over matters of ideological homogeneity- which is already being disentrenched at the home front. \n\nIf this agreement is to succeed, we will have to tolerate and ignore any political differences between our nations, and allow the Norwegians to actually govern themselves any way they seem appropriate."
GER_a_northern_foothold_desc:0 "Removing all German politicians and commanders from Norway was necessary to warm Oslo to the idea of cooperation, but it was not in our best interest- we are still, after all, not an international charity. All our future ambitions in the north still require some sort of, however small, foothold in Norwegian affairs. \n\n Our mission will be small and effective- a few Pakt observers will be assigned in the ministry to monitor government goings on, and a few German officers to drill the troops and coordinate joint exercises with Pakt forces, as well as legal provisions for future German reinforcements and garrisons. You know... just in case."

Seen internationally as an independent player to interact with -and very soon to woo over on one's respective side- on the world stage, Oslo can become a valuable diplomatic middleman with the outside world, giving us far greater access to establish contacts with both our rivals and our future prospects through their own channels, and our "free-willed" and much more internationally amicable ally in the North will be vouching for our interests announcing them as theirs."
GER_and_potential_oil_partner_desc:0 "We might have lost total control over Norway, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we should lose access to the rich oil deposits of the region; great news, considering we could most certainly not afford so. \n\n One of our first priorities as far as German-Norwegian economic cooperation is concerned must be to set up and maintain lucrative trade deals that will guarantee us a generous portion of their petrol supply, in fairly elevated prices that should be able to placate our prospective partners just enough."
GER_bind_the_reichsmark_desc:0 "Many people in the Reich live, and even more have died during the Bürgerkrieg, with the notion that fire and blood is the only way to keep a nation subjugated; but Herr Speer is a different man -he has proven so many times already-, and already has his own battle plan. \n\nThe Norwegian Krone is critically unstable ever since the country won its independence, and Norway is very unlikely to turn down an offer to peg their currency to our own Reichsmark and reverse their downward spiral. In but a couple years, this move will provide us greater control over all Norwegian matters than it ever offered them economic prosperity- both of which we will seek to exploit fully."
GER_strengthen_our_prestige_desc:0 "To say that our reputation on Norway is not stellar would be an understatement; no matter how cooperative the government is to our advances, the average Norwegian would rather die- and most likely will- than allow Germania to meddle in their affairs again, occupiers or otherwise. The situation is precarious enough to endanger the current Norwegian administration itself - and our interests lying within it by proxy.

Since this is within our rights as a sovereign nation, the Amerikaner won't be able to protest: should we win, it would give us great prestige and hit our competitors harshly, though our people might protest for the waste of resources and human lives.\n\nOn the other, we can make sure the war stalls long enough to allow us to extract all of our personnel, material and - even more important - money.

We can't abandon our colonial possession without a fight, but we'll limit our support in order to balance our interests with those of the United States: by keeping the war in a stalemate, we can broker an agreement that suits both competitors' wishes."

Instead, we'll make sure that the loss of our African colonial domains can at least bring some financial advantages.\n\nBy sending enough reinforcements and supplies to the Reichskommissars, we can stall the war long enough to extract all valuable resources and investments from Afrika, before retreating our forces and leaving Hüttig to his fate.

If we want to win, we'll have to fight dirty, no matter the price, even if we have to lose our honor in the process..."
 GER_a_display_of_force_desc:0 "Von Tresckow is right. Despite our precarious situation, we can't shy away from our role as a world power: our colonial possession are important pieces in the great chessboard that is the Reich, and we won't go down without a fight! Of course, we won't begin a direct confrontation with the United States, but we still have a handful of cards at our disposal.\n\nWe'll send the Reichskommissars all the resources they need in order to prevail, as long as it doesn't require the full commitment of the mainland. Under the labels of "increased security garrisons" and "logistical supplies" we'll be able to justify our reinforcements to the rest of the world, and not even the Amerikaner will be able to protest: after all, they are doing exactly the same..."
 GER_show_off_our_pride_desc:0 "Feldmarschall von Tresckow is right. We are a world superpower, and won't allow the Amerikaner and their puppets to meddle in the empire so many Germans died for: each and every part of the Reich is as important to us as Germania itself, and we won't go down without a fight!\n\nThe Reichskommissars will have all they need to prevail and secure our African holdings, and we'll organize several special operations in order to surgically strike at the enemy, weakening them and allowing our main forces to prevail. Still, we need to act fast, or the costs of such an operation may be more than what our people is ready to accept..."
 GER_another_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "Warfare may have changed since the last time we faced the Amerikaner in battle, but the basic principles are still the same. With good logistics, careful planning and a large concentration of mobile and armored forces, we can enact a Schwerpunkt in the weak point of the enemy forces, breaking their front and circling their forces without a chance for them to react.\n\nShould this tactic fail, then we'll have to rely on our soldiers' inner strength and discipline. Ever since the old days of Prussian glory, we have prevailed over superior enemies thanks to our superior training and organization: von Tresckow has plans to return the Wehrmacht to full efficiency, and this proxy war is a perfect simulation that will give us precious insights over the needed reforms."
 GER_just_like_old_times_desc:0 "Feldmarschall von Tresckow is quite satisfied with our forces' performance in the conflict. It seems that, after almost twenty years of decadence and neglect, old values such as discipline, meritocracy and organization are slowly returning to the forefront. Despite all the difficulties we might encounter during this strange conflict, we are slowly finding our common cause and camaraderie.\n\nPerhaps this war won't go according to our plans and wishes, but this is already a result. Our forces fight together well, seeing each other once again as brothers-in-arms rather than potential traitors or enemies, and coordination is improving steadily as time passes. This feels just like the old times..."
 GER_finish_what_we_started_desc:0 "The time has come. With our interests protected and our plans fulfilled, we can now retreat from our African possessions: in but a few weeks, all remaining troops and administrative personnel will be evacuated by plane or ship, effectively ending our presence in the Dark Continent. As soon as the last plane has taken off, our colonial empire will be no more.\n\nWhile a sad and humiliating choice, this was the best outcome we could hope for under the present circumstances. At home, many accuse us of cowardice for abandoning our rightfully-conquered lands, but many others rejoice for the end of what they considered a waste of lives and resources. Time will tell who is right..."
 GER_leave_without_a_trace_desc:0 "With our final preparations complete, the extraction and evacuation procedures have begun in earnest. Our forces on the field will retreat, together with any official of the Reichskommissariaten who wishes to abandon Africa, to selected airstrips, where an air bridge will ensure smooth transport to Germany. All heavy equipment will be extracted by ship or, if it proves impossible, abandoned under the insignia of the Reichskommissars in order to mask our presence.\n\nThe Amerikaner have tacitly promised not to attack the evacuation convoys, under condition that we do the same. To the rest of the world, it will be as if we were never part of this war, a small ink stain on a blank page: it will be relegated to the darkest corner in the labyrinthine archives of history, as we leave without a warning, without a sound, without a trace..."
 GER_bear_no_responsibility_desc:0 "We have nothing to do with these Kommissars who waged war without our permission. We wash our hands clean of the blood of this war, and our Führer is not to deal with guilt concerning the conflict.\n\nWe did what we could as master of our territories. But this war is clearly not our war. It was a dirty war. A foolish one.\n\nWe must begin cleansing ourselves of the filth."

He has sought to follow the example of the madman Himmler, and now the natives have risen up, laying waste to his dreams of a Burgundian state in the mountains.\n\nAnd unfortunately for him and the natives, we must end all this. It is time to call upon the mighty force of our Fatherland to bring order to the quagmire in the East."
GER_heading_back_to_gerogia_desc:0 "Just like the war in the years past, our plan to regain control of Kaukasia from the troublesome natives is clear.\n\nWe will seize the initiative, break through the lands, and speedily take control of Kaukasia, moving around what is too strong and cutting resistance up into pockets.\n\nSurely, this should see us back in Georgia, and with law and order restored."
GER_cash_is_king_desc:0 "War's over. Peace's in.

It's only getting on the nerves on everyone who is enjoying the good stuff that comes to us from Kaukasia.\n\nSurely, their worries are founded on nothing but rumors."

Surely, we have been on the side of those who prosper, yes?"
GER_workers_rights_are_king_desc:0 "For the love of what is good, we have finally concluded our war in Kaukasia. And it's time to make a choice.\n\nWe have chosen to follow the lead of the cabinet, the Fuhrer challenging their wishes to set up a military government as he wished for the industrialists to manage the region. For now, there is a compromise.\n\nThe military will take control of everything but the areas which produce oil. That's for the industralists."
GER_the_union_makes_us_strong_desc:0 "Under this new military government wished for by the cabinet, the natives have been given more rights and freedoms than they had before the war.\n\n This is something that they have not enjoyed for years. And now they have it all. Though the four great men of the cabinet boast that the emancipation of the natives shall be worth it in the long run, there are fears that Kaukausia may cost more than it really promises back."
GER_solidarity_forever_desc:0 "Okay, so that was a surprising turn.\n\n It seems that the great gang of four assisting the Fuhrer were right about their boasts. It appears that, thanks to the freedoms given to the natives, the region is becoming more productive. The people are happy, and are more willing to contribute to the Reich's future. The profits are trickling into the economy.\n\n Perhaps treating people with dignity and liberty works out after all."


GER_the_mad_barons_desc:0 "Josias has been overthrown, and the industrialists have seized control of Kaukasia. Once they have taken power, they declared themselves independent.\n\nThis will not do. Our Fuhrer seeks to deal with them peacefully and fairly. This may seem to be the best way to handle them. Hopefully, they will be convinced to return to the Fatherland's embrace."
GER_power_through_the_krim_desc:0 "It is going to cost us a lot of money, but it will have to do.\n\nOur Fuhrer has decided that it is important for us to ensure the loyalty of the industrialists by giving them whatever they need to improve their infrastructure. And on top of that, we will provide them with all the power they need to keep their country running.\n\nIn time, they should realize that this would mean reintegration with the Reich, and happily so."
GER_reestablish_black_sea_trade_desc:0 "Resuming trade in the East would benefit both the Fatherland and Kaukasia.\n\nOil from the Black Sea must continue to flow into the heart of the lands of the German people. Our Fuhrer wishes to give the industrialists a more promising cut in the trade than the previous one. It should help us get them on our side once more."
GER_industrialists_from_the_ruhr_desc:0 "Our Fatherland has the expertise of great men and women in the Ruhr. From there, our Fuhrer has decided that it would be of great help to Kaukasia and to our efforts in regaining the trust of our people there if we sent these people into the East to assist them.\n\nSurely enough, our own specialists would give them an easier time to work with their industries.\n\nIt's going to cost us though, as we must provide housing and pay during their stay in the East."
GER_junkers_from_the_north_desc:0 "Providing some very interesting amounts of money to the landed Junkers would help us gain their favor. Indeed, it is an expensive gesture to make, but it should do us more good than harm.\n\nEarning the favor of these people would help us in the long run, and our own offer to these people would certainly keep them close to us as we remain close to them."
GER_like_blood_from_an_artery_desc:0 "Like blood coursing through the arteries of a human body, our Fatherland comes alive once more as oil shipments from the East resume.\n\nThankfully, this is because our friends in Kaukasia have wisely chosen to return to the Fatherland's embrace. Together once more, we shall see a future of prosperity for the entire Reich, especially as the oil powers the lights of our homes and the infrastructure of our homeland."
GER_the_mad_count_desc:0 "Josias has crowned himself King of all Kaukasia. And this shall not be tolerated.\n\nOur Reich has not come to life to see this sort of betrayal.

GER_protect_the_oil_desc:0 "The war to overthrow a king who should not be a king has come to an end. And for good.\n\nit's time for us to secure our interests. Kaukasia is teeming with oil. And oil is the vehicle of life for our Fatherland. It is important for us to keep it safe from the restless natives and so, despite the costs, we will station brave men to oversee the security of our workers who are eager to keep the Fatherland alive through the oil which flow through the pipelines. No matter how much."
GER_secure_our_interests_desc:0 "We must bring an end to the chaos of Kaukasia. At our own expense, it is vital to secure the land with the help of a new government under Friedrich Klausing. \n\nWith him in charge of the land, we surely would see repayment for our expense."
GER_rebuild_grozny_desc:0 "The city of Grozny has been a treasured center of the native population in Kaukasia.\n\nIt is important for us too. Therefore, it is our duty to rebuild it. The natives will surely be grateful, but we too will be grateful to see it rebuilt for the sake of the prosperity of the Reich. It will be a great deal of expense, but resurrecting this city should pay for it."
GER_assist_caucasia_desc:0 "We cannot leave this land alone to reorganize and to reform itself. Alone, it would wither like a flower in the desert.\n\nLet us make sure that our Fatherland gives it the support it needs to get back on its feet. Though this shall bring a great load upon the shoulders of our economy, it would be worth it as the region holds great promise for the future of the Reich."
GER_the_reconstruction_committee_desc:0 "After so much expense and after so much time, Kaukasia is coming alive again.\n\nAlthough this has been close to the hearts of those who have done their duty for the Fatherland, it is time for us to start letting go. Therefore, a committee of men shall be established to take the reins from us.\n\nIn time, with our trust placed in their arms, there would be prosperity to enjoy in the future for the Reich and for Kaukasia."

A peaceful partition of land between the settlers and the natives has been made. But at the price of what?  We have given so much of our influence to the benefit of the settlers, but that didn't secure a right to some of the land they wanted. Instead, the natives have gotten more than any German would have wanted them to have. We do not appreciate these new borders. A deep blow to our prestige. The people must be grumbling about this, suspecting that we have settled for less than we deserve. We quietly agree that the land there originated with the natives. But such land is too important for us and for the settlers we sent out to the east. We must seek subtly to strengthen the position of the settlers."
GER_placate_the_natives_desc:0 "The idea of supporting the natives with an injection of cash along with some material assistance is interesting to us. Unfortunately for us, it is the only meaningful way to change the balance of powers of the states which replaced our former Reichskommisariat. After all, we can't do much against the natives, so why not help them instead? Let us hope that this will be our first step to solving the dilemma of our settlers and those Slavic dogs.

Now, they have reached their breaking point; they will soon come to us for negotiations.  We must seize the chance to exploit it. When their representatives come to the table to meet us, we must make an offer they cannot help but accept. For us to wipe away the debt they have, they must grant us Brauchitschstadt. They would have to think about it, as all men do when presented with offers. And like all men, they will have to enjoy what we give to them in exchange for what they have to give up."
GER_reaffirm_loyalty_desc:0 "One should wonder about the settlers, their affections for the Fatherland we share. Are they still willing to deal with us as we deal with them? Are they still loyal to the homeland of their fathers and mothers? We would have to ensure that they really are loyal. And that that would continue. Eager to pursue this, no matter the outcome, we must send a representative to see them, in order to see how things really are on the ground which our people now own. And to determine if we would need to... encourage them to stay loyal. Or else."

The war which we have fought against those who didn't want to pursue a better future for Germany has made us unable to continue that support for some time. Now, we have time. And we must make use of it. We should start preparing new deliveries of goods and resources which they will need to rebuild their homes and their communities. Just as we had done for our Fatherland, let us make sure that they can do the same."
GER_showing_our_commitment_desc:0 "The economy of our people living in the east is not strong enough to stand by itself. Therefore, to make sure that our people can live more easily in the future, we must provide not only the materials and the tools they need to rebuild their world but the money they need to buy the things they need and want, and to stimulate their economy by letting the cash flow. It should do some good at least. If it doesn't show results immediately, we must hope that it would in the future. But to make it to that kind of goal, cash would have to be injected into east regularly until such time that they would no longer need more of it. That way, it would be sustainable as it made its influence on the economy more significant. And by doing this, it would have to show that we remain committed to their future. And in return for that, they better show their gratitude in some way."
GER_back_to_the_pakt_desc:0 "We must celebrate the results of our efforts for the Fatherland. Our settlers remain loyal to the Reich. And as they remain loyal, we improved their economy, and made better their lives out in the east. In time, perhaps, they would enjoy the same blessings we in the Fatherland have. For now, however, it was time to invite them back into the Pakt. We have already dealt with the rest. And though such support did not come free, all they would have to do is obey some of our requests. And so long as they went along with them, they would be free to do any other thing that was permissible.  We have chosen Alexis von Roenne, together with Otto Remer, to go to the settlers.

Now there is conflict raging on to the east of our Fatherland.\n\nWe have only two paths to take, but taking one or the other will have consequences that are sure to affect our standing in the world and the future of the two states. One option we have is to simply send some aid and a few advisers to shore up the settlers in their efforts at keeping their state intact. This is the more limited option, which should appeal to the world as well as to the more liberal elements of our Fatherland. But we can lose the war for the settlers because of our hands-off approach.\n\nAnother choice we could decide to take is to intervene on the behalf of the settlers. But doing so will draw the condemnations of the international community, hindering our hopes of a brighter future for Germany. However, it would appease our more traditional colleagues and their supporters. \n\nWhat matters now is what choice would matter in the long run for both our people in the East and our Reich."

We'll have to send trusted people to the East to manage their state. For now.\n\nDeploying Alexis von Roenne as well as Otto Remer should do the trick.

Once again, our soldiers must march on against the Slavs and save our settlers.\n\nBut how we handle this intervention is entirely something else. And we must decide quickly and carefully.\n\nIf our Fuhrer wishes to oversee this war, to thoroughly assess what methods are right or wrong, our intervention may save more innocent lives. But that will slow things down for us.

GER_Stabssitzung_desc:0 "It's been quite some time since we assumed power, but Herr Speer still insists on doing things his way. It's worth entertaining him for now, especially since our position isn't wholly secure yet. Our illustrious Führer thinks that it's worth bringing those damn gangsters into yet another meeting, as if it will help soothe their outrage at losing everything they've stolen in the past thirty years.\n\nI anticipate that this meeting will be a complete waste of time, but it's not significant enough to bother fighting Speer on. The corporations already know our plans are in direct opposition to their interests, so it's not giving them any ground. No matter what Abs or his cronies have to say, I can at least be sure that Speer will throw his weight behind me. I'll see those criminals laid low, or my name's not Ludwig Erhard."
GER_Kartellgesetz_desc:0 "Well, the meeting went about as one would expect. Much wailing and gnashing of teeth, but nothing I haven't heard before. Abs brought up the legal challenges we'd face in attempting to 'reform' the corporations, just as I expected he would. I'm not sure the Führer had actually taken that into consideration; it's a good thing he wasn't facing the vultures alone. The world's truly run mad when men of the 20th century will declare a legal challenge against the abolition of slavery.\n\nIf they want to play at legal games, I'm happy to oblige them. It's been far too long since 'antitrust' was common parlance in German corporate world. With the Führer's full clout behind it, the Kartellgesetz will be the sword to cut the Gordian Knot of slavery and corporate dominance. No matter what it takes, I will see those economic monstrosities torn into a thousand pieces."
GER_industria_desc:0 "As much as one wishes it wasn't so, taking down the megacorporations will be too difficult to accomplish solely via direct means. We have to keep in mind that breaking them is only half the battle; if the people aren't able to capitalize on their fall, then the effort will be wasted.\n\nThe Führer won't be happy, but it's time to take another bite out of our treasury. While the people are kept afloat by welfare and subsidies, we need a good, solid jolt to the heart of our economy to keep it pumping. 'A whole shitload of money', as Herr Schmidt phrased it. I can't vouch for the man's manners, but that's the gist of it. A massive dose of cash for the middle class will give us the short-term boost we need to stay fully functional while dealing with the corporations."
GER_The_New_German_Worker_desc:0 "At least Herr Speer has a head for selling our ideas. In truth, the 'New German Worker' isn't as new as the propaganda posters say he is; it's really just a return to the old normal, when the Mittelstand was the basis of the economy and ordinary working-class men could find good, honest employment.\n\nHowever, a victory remains a victory. The reality is that both the working and middle classes are back in earnest. No longer is German society so heavily stratified between haves and have-nots. The Reichswirtschaftsministerium must continue to support the renewal of a liberal social structure in both word and deed. The prosperity of the people is our first and best line of defense against the greed and treachery of the megacorporations."
GER_Cities_of_a_Thousand_Fires_desc:0 "Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Dortmund, Mülheim... Germany's once-renowned coal and steel centers were hit the hardest by the economic crash of the 50s. After all, why pay a free laborer to toil in the mines and foundries when a slave can do it for free? A slave will not balk at increased hours, or dare to protest when his fellows are crushed or burned alive in an industrial accident. I'll admit free workers can be uppity at times, but that's nothing compared to the inhumanity of industrial slavery.\n\nThankfully, things are returning to normal in the Ruhr and other such areas. Free workers are rapidly displacing slaves due to mandated employment quotas and the establishment of independent industrial Mittelstand companies. Factories abandoned by the megacorporations in favor of industrial slave camps are firing up once again. We'll continue our support of these liberated industries, and do unto the corporations as they did unto our economy in decades past."
GER_Land_of_Diligence_desc:0 "'Made in Germany' used to stand for something great. It meant quality of craftsmanship, and represented a proud artisanal tradition going back centuries. Not for nothing did Tommy and the Yanks joke about 'German efficiency'. The corporations, however, usurped this label. With the advent of slavery during the war, 'Made in Germany' became a euphemism for cruelty, exploitation and inhumanity.\n\nFor our products to become world-renowned once more, we must reclaim our industrial legacy from the clutches of the cartels. Our blue-collar workers are already doing admirable work in this regard; the new recruits are taking to their chosen fields with gusto, aided by the expertise of the old guard. With each passing day, we come one step closer to shedding our shame and setting the gold standard for quality production."
GER_Social_Market_desc:0 "Germany has always experimented with social policies, but some were much more successful than others. I can't rightly advocate for a welfare state anymore, no matter how much my companions insist on doing so. I hate to disappoint them, especially with the proven benefits of a social state in mind, but I don't believe such a system is viable in the long term.\n\nWe should instead pursue the social market - a system where the workers are protected not by an overbearing welfare state, but by moderate government regulations, social security via ease of access to work, and the humanely-run nature of the economy. When operating correctly - which it shall be, under our oversight - this will keep both workers and employers happy, ensuring social harmony and minimizing class conflict."
GER_Social_State_desc:0 "I was never enamored of the welfare state established by Bismarck. It certainly helped keep socialism at bay, but the sheer amount of money and red tape involved made it hell to keep running. However, try as I might, I can't convince the others that their 'social state' (as they're calling it now) is a sub-optimal route for us to take. I must admit that the whole idea encompasses more than just economics - vital as those are - so I'm willing to give some ground here. If Speer is willing to support it, then I won't fight them on it. They want to deal with the ramifications in twenty or thirty years, that's fine by me.\n\nI'll direct the Reichswirtschaftsministerium to begin funding the social state programs drawn up by Kiesinger. No doubt many of them will need revising by a learned economist. I just hope that Speer knows what he's doing by approving this."
GER_Reichs_Needs_desc:0 "Damnation, but Speer might be right again. The Zollverein is a German creation and will almost certainly remain so regardless of how much I try to change that fact. I suppose there's no use in continuing to deny the reality of the situation. Now isn't the time for high-minded ideals, no matter what Schmidt says.\n\nThe Zollverein shall, for the foreseeable future, remain a customs union inherently German in nature. In addition to keeping it centralized under German control, we shall encourage the German way of doing things in our economic partners. If it works for us, it should work for them as well. I'd rather they learn through experience than being dictated to, but we may as well make the best possible use of our European dominance."
GER_sapientia_desc:0 "Thanks to Hitler's megalomania, it's not just Germany I find myself responsible for. The entirety of this Third Reich, from the Rhine to the Volga, falls under my jurisdiction when it comes to economic matters. That's a tall order, even for me. Still, I will persevere - this responsibility is too great to neglect, and the potential for a brighter pan-European future lives on beneath all the muck of slavery and bloodshed.\n\nEastern Europe makes up a huge portion of our territory and wider hegemony, but has been systematically misused ever since it was conquered. Ukraine has so much more to offer than just wheat! And the Caucasus - what a sorry mess! All that oil, dredged up by natives in utterly inhumane conditions while the industrial barons grow fat on the profits that should be enriching the ones doing the work! To hell with the Party - I'll get eastern Europe the future it deserves if it's the last thing I do!"
GER_Limitless_Potential_desc:0 "Even with the Rückführungsprogramm in process, many old minority populations will remain in Germany itself. The NSDAP, brutes that they are, have never let up on their insistence that these people be expelled, Germanized or otherwise purged from the nation, citing 'racial purity' as a foremost concern.\n\nWell, if I were as stupid and backwards as the average Party member, I wouldn't talk about race. Any intellectual who isn't neck-deep in 'National Socialist science' knows for a fact that all this talk of non-German inferiority is utter tripe - even if they won't dare say so in public. Bohemia and Poznan were booming industrial hubs long before the Nazis came along and started driving the locals out. Now that Germanization is over, we can finally offer equal opportunities to these deprived peoples and begin healing old wounds. They have as much right to be part of the Reich as Germans do."
GER_Treating_Wounds_desc:0 "Never has there been so heinous an act of imperialism as Generalplan Ost. Under this insane scheme devised by Himmler's circle of evil, the economy of eastern Europe was devastated in short order. Heavy industry was appropriated, economic centers razed, the population butchered and a disastrous policy of regressive agrarianism imposed upon the survivors. Even were the Reich to vanish tomorrow, it could take centuries for the region to return to even pre-war levels of prosperity by itself.\n\nIt's too late to help the dead, but it's not too late for the living. While Germany's crimes can never be erased, the wounds inflicted can be healed - at least to a degree. It's hard to say where our resources are best allocated to undo the damage, but I've settled on Warsaw and Kiev. As the foremost hubs of Poland and Ukraine respectively, it just makes sense to focus on rebuilding them first. Germany has plenty of money and equipment to spare, and we have a responsibility to help the conquered. Scars will remain, but even they will heal in time."
GER_Future_in_their_Hands_desc:0 "No matter how much the old propaganda says otherwise, or how much the Völkisch dullards cite Mein Kampf, we need the East. Germany has, for the time being, reached its industrial capacity with current levels of technology and development possibilities. Only the East, with its vast tracts of land, bountiful resources and remnants of Soviet industrialization, offers further expansion of physical economic interests.\n\nNo longer can the East be demonized as a cesspit of subhumans, fit only for the harvesting of slaves. As part of our propaganda efforts, we must shift gears to depict the East as the rising star of the Einheitspakt. Without the state's endorsement, individuals and Mittelstand corporations are unlikely to bother investing in the future of the East. German backing for eastern industry and business is essential for fostering home-grown economies in the region."
GER_Guiding_Hand_desc:0 "No matter how much we invest, eastern Europeans will never trust us if we insist on holding their hand throughout the process of economic regeneration. True equality is a long way off, but we must work to present ourselves as a partner rather than a master. Germany will always be Europe's largest economy but having the same amount of clout in legal terms will help foster trust with our new friends.\n\nRather than maintaining German control over resources and heavy industry in the East, we should place these in the hands of reliable locals wherever possible. Allowing for a strong degree of autonomy will give them the experience needed to become self-reliant, and will demonstrate our good intentions. No amount of whitewashing our economic dominance will give us that."
GER_Firm_Chain_desc:0 "I don't like it, but Speer might have a point for once. The East is in shambles, with its middle class long gone and its economy reduced to agrarianism. Germany has no choice but to accept its role as an overlord for now and maintain close control over economic development. It feels so wrong - but the alternative could devolve into socio-economic chaos if handled incorrectly.\n\nThe Reich Government and approved representatives shall continue to hold direct control of most eastern resources and heavy industry for the time being. Eastern workers - and the middle class, once it reappears - will operate under German tutelage, so that we can impart our knowledge and expertise to them. Their independence will thus be delayed, but will also potentially be a lot more stable. Not my preferred option, but perhaps it's for the best."
GER_Europes_Dreams_desc:0 "The Zollverein has the foundation it needs to succeed; now, it is time for Germany to loosen its grip and take a step back. If this is to be a truly pan-European project, member states must have the ability to make their own mark on it. Maintaining its original purely German nature will harm international relations in the long-term, which sits ill with both my conscience and my good sense.\n\nMany of the rights and privileges granted to our junior partners will be relatively insignificant in nature, of course. There are many burdens that come with economic freedom, and only we are in a position to bear them at this time. It will be difficult for our people, as they prosper, to cede more control to the rest of the Zollverein in the future, but I have faith that our institutions will make it happen."
GER_Council_of_Gods_desc:0 "IG Farben, one of the world's largest conglomerates, is a blight on Europe comparable only to the NSDAP. They were with the Hitlerites from the beginning, missing no opportunity to profit from the late Führer's cruel, barbaric ideology. Presiding over it from the shadows was Hermann Josef Abs, a true wolf in sheep's clothing if ever there was one. To the Party, he is an untouchable god; to the corporate world, a model executive; to us, the greatest threat we face after Field Marshal Schörner.\n\nWe must break Abs' power, politically and financially. Too long have his crimes gone unaccounted for, and his sway over Germany unchallenged. As the world's most powerful banker, he has virtually unlimited resources at his disposal, so we cannot hope to destroy him by purely financial means. We must instead employ more... direct means. To slay the beast, we shall bleed it out before going straight for the heart. Abs will regret the day he sold his soul in pursuit of wealth."
GER_An_Enemy_to_Prosperity_desc:0 "IG Farben are mighty enough that a head-on offensive could backfire with severe consequences. Their crimes are beyond counting, but we must hold our anger at bay, bide our time and devise a safe plan of attack.\n\nDespite our moral duty to those who suffer under Abs' yoke, our attacks must be focused on IG Farben itself. They are deep enough in illegal activities that it would be easy to start digging up dirt on them. Any and all evidence of wrongdoing should be recorded and stockpiled so that we can begin a campaign of litigation against middle management, executives and the company itself."
GER_Attack_from_the_flank_desc:0 "The Reichsnachrichtendienst has been a useful asset so far, but has mostly concerned itself dealing with Herr Speer's political foes. While necessary to secure our position, I believe it is time for our friend Herr Gehlen to redirect his efforts towards the corporations. Thankfully, the Führer is of a mind with myself, and Gehlen has a vested interest in seeing his backroom rivals destroyed.\n\nIt will be child's play to bring down the corporations once the RND is unleashed. It is an open secret that Abs and his cronies have enormous amounts of illicit funds, offshore accounts and investments in enterprises of dubious legality. Abs always thought himself above the Gestapo, and was correct to do so - but he hasn't yet reckoned with Gehlen and young Wessel, the most talented and ruthless operatives we are blessed with. IG Farben's paper trail is miles long and spattered with blood - easy to follow, and more incriminating than we could ever hope it to be."
GER_An_Enemy_to_Freedom_desc:0 "To hell with caution! No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, as Herr Speidel would say. IG Farben is an enemy of freedom, and therefore an enemy of the state, people, and - helpfully - the Führer! If they want war, they'll damn well get it!\n\nAnd what better way to make war upon a corporation than to deprive it of a workforce? IG Farben is wholly dependent on its millions of slaves to continue turning a profit. The executives have been digging their heels ever since the beginning of the Rückführungsprogramm, doing all they can to forestall the inevitable release of their victims, but their schemes and litigation are no match for the might of our apparatus of state. All means at our disposal shall be directed towards the destruction of the corporation's slave network. A crude, imperfect solution - but supremely satisfying."
GER_Sending_the_Wehrmacht_desc:0 "Our good friend Henning von Tresckow loathes slavery almost as much as he does National Socialism itself. Despite his bluster and slightly esoteric Prussianism, he is a man pure of heart and true to his Christian beliefs - including a hatred for all injustice. He has a crucial role to play in the coming struggle, and it's time to bring him on board.\n\nVon Tresckow understands the importance of sending a strong, clear message. The demise of IG Farben and its vile master will be ours - to the Reich, to the other corporations, and to the world. They made slavery what it is today, and driving a knife into the heart of their corrupt enterprise will prove once and for all that there will be no mercy offered to the wicked in our new order."
GER_dealing_with_igfarben_desc:0 "They thought themselves invincible, unstoppable, above the rule of law and the nation's justice. They thought wrong. IG Farben is on its knees, brought low by decisive action and the might of the Reich Government. With Hitler gone and the reactionaries disempowered, they can no longer hide behind the skirts of the military-industrial complex. Let this be a testament to our resolve and pursuit of a more righteous world.\n\nIt's time to strike the killing blow. Abs and his Council of Rats are scrambling to consolidate what little they have left and flee the Reich - this cannot be allowed to happen. Herr Speer is a dictator with unquestioned authority, and it's past time he exercised it. Thankfully, he is entirely on board with the idea of bringing down the hammer in as dramatic a fashion as possible. What better method than to order the immediate and indefinite arrest of Hermann Josef Abs on charges of high treason? Let's see the bastard charm his way out of this one."
GER_Current_of_Machines_desc:0 "Siemens bears the dubious honor of being the least repulsive and corrupt of the megacorporations. Some mistake this for honor or kindness on the part of their chief executive, Ernst von Siemens. They are fools - von Siemens harbors nothing in his mind save for greed and a lust for yet more wealth.\n\nThey make use of slaves, though not nearly to the same extent as their peers. I suppose that's a point in their favor, though not reason enough to trust them. Still, they have proven the least opposed to our economic reforms and intention to abolish slavery - solely, of course, because they have the least to lose. Still, we shouldn't refuse their overtures if they can be useful to us. We'll hear von Siemens out, and turn his sense of self-preservation to our purposes. He knows that there'll be hell to pay if he betrays us. Perhaps that alone will keep the cowardly snake in line while we dismantle his cartel."
GER_Uneasy_Ally_desc:0 "Von Siemens is scum, but he sees the writing on the wall and knows that his cartel's days are numbered. He knows that our threats are neither empty nor idle. He is a rat escaping a sinking ship, clawing at the last thread of hope. He doesn't deserve our mercy, but if that's the price for his cooperation, then so be it.\n\nIn return for amnesty, von Siemens will not oppose the reorganization of his eponymous corporation. He has promised to sit down, shut up and hand over his slaves, illegal assets and whatever else we demand - all in exchange for his wealth, his position and his life. It sickens me to spare this snake, but the easier this whole process is, the better. Anyone with common sense would do the same."
GER_International_Competitor_desc:0 "Despite its nature as a cartel, there remains much one can begrudgingly admire about Siemens. Their innovations in the fields of home electronics, computing and machinery are comparable to those of the Americans and Japanese. Only von Siemen's corruption and their reliance on slavery for manufacturing has kept them from becoming a global leader to outshine the best of Guangdong's corporations.\n\nWe shall exploit Siemens' more useful tendencies, even as we continue to diminish their power. God willing, we can turn this wretched hive of villainy into something useful that we can be proud of. Only once they've been cut down to a more acceptable size, of course."
GER_Zukunftsmusik_desc:0 "Sparing Siemens, while a moral compromise, is the sensible thing to do. They will be dismantled, dismembered, broken on the altar of freedom - but not destroyed. They will endure, chained and bound, their leash gripped firmly in the hand of the state. Not until von Siemens and the other executives are long gone shall they be considered trustworthy.\n\nIn the meantime, they shall continue their work under our auspices and on our terms. No longer will slaves toil away on assembly lines, putting together Siemens-branded electronics while the company's directors grow fat on the profits. Their work will be done by free, paid employees and the just taxes paid. This mercy, extended only because we so wish it, is far more than Siemens deserves, and they had best remember that fact."
GER_Conglomerate_of_Steel_desc:0 "Reichswerke - formerly Reichswerke Hermann Göring - is not actually a private company, but may as well be one anyway, given the enormous amount of influence and autonomy they possess. Having such a large conglomerate under state control would normally stifle its profits, but Reichswerke possesses a monopoly on steel, coal and other heavy industries. Combine that with the fact that they are remarkably good at avoiding their taxes, and you have a recipe for a truly abominable cartel.\n\nReichswerke owns massive numbers of slaves; not quite as many as IG Farben, but still numbering in the millions. These are some of the most pitiful, poorly-treated people in the entire system, forced to work in dangerous mines, foundries and factories for as long as their overseers demand. Reichswerke slaves are chewed up and spat out as corpses by the deadly meat grinder of industry, leaving thousands dead every year as the executives and their friends in the NSDAP and bureaucracy grow ever richer. We must slay this beast of iron and blood, no matter the cost."
GER_Money_to_Gain_desc:0 "With their close ties to the state bureaucracy, Reichswerke will already have caught wind of our plans for them. This is going to make dealing with them a lot more difficult than I'd hoped, since they're no doubt hurrying to burn documents, cover their tracks and relocate their assets out of our reach.\n\nWe have to go in hard and fast. If we want Geilenburg's empire dismantled and scattered to the winds before he can salvage his wealth, we should take advantage of the control we already have over Reichswerke. With the clout of a Führer Directive, the dissolution of the cartel into its constituent corporations can begin immediately."
GER_Mass_Privatisation_desc:0 "Our slash-and-burn approach is working like a charm, just as I predicted. Reichswerke never saw us coming. Geilenberg has reportedly been thrown into a spin by our rapid and uncompromising attack, offering no resistance to the brutal dismemberment of his enterprise.\n\nKrupp, Rheinmetall and dozens more corporations are once again free and in the hands of responsible businessmen who can be trusted not to seek a monopoly or abuse the responsibility granted to them. Unfortunately, the redistribution of assets means that some of the corporations spat out by Reichswerke are still in possession of slaves. I'm more than a little concerned, but hopefully any further abuses can be prevented with careful monitoring of the situation and the continuation of the Rückführungsprogramm. I just hope the new bosses have more moral fiber than Geilenberg does."
GER_Lives_to_Save_desc:0 "I'm all for going full steam ahead with privatization of Reichswerke, but there's a catch - as always. If the de-cartelization of the corporation is too fast and disorganized, the millions of slaves it owns could quite easily end up in the hands of our enemies. Once in private hands, ensuring their freedom will become more difficult - not impossible, but more of a challenge than it should be.\n\nWe have a responsibility to the oppressed. Their lives are worth more than anything we could hope to gain from the immediate destruction of Reichswerke. Though it will give Geilenberg enough time to save some of his fortune, that's a small price to pay compared to saving thousands more lives. He'll still get his day in court - that much, I swear. For now, we should privatize Reichswerke only to a limited degree and at a measured pace, so that we can ensure no slaves fall through the cracks to be denied their freedom."
GER_Partial_Privatisation_desc:0 "The privatization of Reichswerke isn't turning out as profitable as it might have been, but continues at a decent clip. Entrepreneurs looking to snap up pieces of the cartel were naturally disappointed by our decision to retain majority state ownership, but it was a necessary move to keep the slaves safe from prolonged bondage.\n\nOnce enough of Reichswerke's assets have been sold off, the company will be put under new management and the old executives prosecuted for their crimes. Never again will innocent people be sacrificed in the pursuit of wealth amid the smoke and fire of the Rhine and Ruhr."
GER_Past_is_Past_desc:0 "With their assets seized or privatized and the corporation itself brought to heel, Reichswerke has been dealt a blow from which it will never recover. We've put paid to Geilenberg's greed and ambition, liberating his wealth for the nation and ending the brutal practice of industrial slavery in his mines and factories.\n\nFrom here on out, it's only a matter of time until Reichswerke is little more than a footnote in history - a department of the Reich Government managing our nationalized industries. Soon, the name will be all that remains, and even that will change in time. Geilenberg's bloody empire will die with him, as it should have long ago."
GER_Core_of_Arms_desc:0 "Daimler-Benz hides behind a veneer of respectability, maintaining a relatively small industrial presence compared to its competitors. They have never been competitive internationally - the largest overseas presence they have is in the motor pools of despots and dictators. Within the Reich, they are a wolf in sheep's clothing, keeping their operations quiet and their number of slaves relatively low.\n\nThe reality is, however, that they represent something far worse than a humble, medium-sized conglomerate. Their CEO, Friedrich Flick, has fingers in every pie. While Daimler-Benz tries to remain as inoffensive as possible, Flick wastes no opportunity to further enrich himself and solidify the slave system. Through intermediaries and stocks, he owns millions of slaves in some of the most brutal labor camps and factories the Reich has to offer. He is responsible for untold suffering - and by extension, so is his cartel. Worst of all, he was a major donor to the SS, funding their crimes for his own benefit. He is a criminal and a traitor both, and will be dealt with as such."
GER_Little_Gain_desc:0 "While Daimler-Benz as a whole might deserve to be destroyed, there's little sense in doing so. Most of the cartel's worst excesses are done via intermediaries, leaving their good image intact. We can exploit this - decapitate the cartel, break it up, and put someone with a bit of humanity in charge, but let the core company remain. They could be a major employer, and with a little help they could establish a new standard of quality for cars, giving us another highly-profitable export.\n\nHowever, they will be punished. Severely. The entire board of directors is complicit in Flick's crimes and will be prosecuted the same as their boss. Middle management is also rife with corruption and Party-aligned men, so we'll need to purge them too, albeit a little less violently. Finally, every single subsidiary of the corporation will be torn away and sold off, further increasing the number of Mittelstand companies and permanently constraining Daimler-Benz's power."
GER_Much_to_Give_desc:0 "If Daimler-Benz has a redeeming quality, it's their eye for talent. The corporation employs many of the Reich's best engineers to design their vehicles. They also hold many patents for advanced technology, which will be very useful when it comes to competing with our economic rivals.\n\nThe R&D section of the cartel will be retained, minus the few criminals to be found therein. That should reduce it to a state more suitable to our purposes.

And, most importantly of all, the slaves will suffer and die no longer at the whims of cruel overseers and soulless men in suits.\n\nThe only issue that remains is that of corporate assets acquired by the state. Our continued ownership will only lower their profitability and potential; we should sell them off to the Mittelstand on the cheap and be rid of them as soon as possible so that they don't continue sponging up our money.

The last time we received such an influx of capital was during the days of the war economy, when the Heer looted and pillaged like a pack of barbarians, and we all know where that led us.\n\nWith that in mind, I believe we have the perfect thing to invest in: the Zollverein. Our member states are still painfully under-industrialized, impoverished and backwards. As the leader of this customs union and the foremost economy of Europe, it is our responsibility to offer direct economic aid. There's a certain justice in using the ill-gotten gains of slavery to heal the nations from whence those unfortunate souls were stolen. Perhaps, in time, this will soothe the wounds of war.

For all our progress, we are still a nation rebuilding from ruin and years of depression. As Europe's largest economy, what benefits us will directly benefit our economic partners. Not as readily appreciable as just giving them the money, but the logic is sound. Handouts can only do so much, and the Zollverein member states must come to stand on their own two feet someday."

Germany rises, a great Lazarus shaking off the ashes of the pyre it was consigned to by its own foolish leaders. The shackles of slavery lie shattered - not by the senseless violence of revolution, but by the precisely-aimed hammer of economics, backed by Christian virtue and that old German spirit! 'Made in Germany' is no longer a mark of shame, but one of quality! Quality that comes from free labor, fairly paid for! Quality that will become the new standard for Europe!

In lieu of continued military occupation or colonial rule, they would see the Einheitspakt reformed into a hegemonic union of the Reich and a collection of satellite states or protectorates. It would make non-Germans far more amenable to working with us and prove our good intentions, but at the cost of considerable loss of direct control.\n\nConservative elements of the NSDAP, having been brought in line with the Führer's way of thinking, propose the continuation of direct German rule over our conquests, with politically acceptable natives serving an auxiliary role in our administration.

Having trade education more widely available will hopefully stimulate local enterprises and undermine the megacorporations' monopoly on manual labor.

He always disappointed them, and no amount of wealth looted from France and the east could turn his short-lived gains into permanent success. In our victory over the 'plutocracies' of Western Europe and America, we found only poverty and ruination. Now the fruits of 'plutocracy' are available for all the Reich's citizens to enjoy, and they begin to wonder: where lies the credit for this success?

Neither worked, and the working class has simmered away in silent resentment for years, deprived of work by slavery and kept alive with only token welfare from the state.\n\nThe solution to this long-standing issue was obvious: give them what they damn well need. Workers want to work! They want to make an honest living and support themselves, the same as any businessman or career bureaucrat.

Recent advances in technology have allowed experimental u-boats to reach depths never thought possible, and range as far afield as the Caribbean Sea.

There is still glory to be had in the maintenance of an empire. Even if a sailor serves for a decade and never hears a shot fired in anger, he will still have contributed to the continued safety and splendor of the Reich.

This is true only if they view the world through a hostile lens. Yes, non-Pakt fleets in Europe might be concerning, but Italy and Iberia desire war with us no more than we do with them, and Burgundy's fleet is too small to be a threat.

It was only fair that we be able to defend ourselves from seaborne threats.\n\nVon Tresckow has convinced the Führer that a return to the Kaiser's ideas is not, in fact, a Prussian ploy, but a strategically sound decision.

In the end, the most important thing is that we have reached an agreement: the Reich will pay a large, lump sum of money to the Italian Empire, and in exchange the Italian government will consider the matter "fully settled" for the future."

GER_everyone_calm_down:0 "Everyone Calm Down!"
GER_everyone_calm_down_desc:0 "Of course, the news of our concessions to the Italians have caused quite the uproar back home. The conservatives inside our government are even more vocal than before in accusing us of being "traitors to the Reich" due to our way of conducting the negotiations. Now, many ask for our delegation to rebuke all previous statements, and show our southern neighbors "who is the strongest member of the former Axis"\n\nWhile Reichsminister Schmidt keeps negotiating, the Führer will take it upon himself to placate the rowdy bureaucrats and politicians before another civil war breaks out. They will calm down, or they shall face a healthy dose of their own recipe for order!"

GER_a_pact_of_non_aggression_desc:0 "Perhaps the first tangible result of this exhausting round of negotiations, we shall officially propose a pact of non aggression between the Reich and the Italian Empire. By slowly demilitarizing the border, and keeping true to our previous concessions, the Italians will soften with time, and with enough time, they may be willing to cooperate with us more!\n\nHerr Schmidt sees the end of the tunnel, and optimism is spreading among the delegation like a wildfire. We can only hope we are truly leaving this mess, and this isn't an elaborate ploy from the Italians to make us lose our face before the world..."

GER_a_thaw_in_relations:0 "A Thaw in Relations"
GER_a_thaw_in_relations_desc:0 "Finally, we have reached the conclusion of what Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt has labelled, to the agreement of the overwhelming majority of his senior advisors, "the most difficult negotiation of my entire life"\n\nWhile it will take years, perhaps even decades before our relationship with the Italian Empire can become friendly, we have achieved a thaw, which is already more than what we expected of this mess.\n\nAs the fortifications along the Austrian border are slowly abandoned, and the first trains and trucks timidly cross the frontier, exchanging goods between our economies, we can proudly tell the world that we have turned a new page in the history of Europe: a page where diplomacy, and not strength of arms, defines a country's worth!"

GER_an_end_to_autarky_desc:0 "Our great Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, once set our Fatherland on a course to pursue the fulfillment of self-sufficiency. And now that this course has led us nowhere, it is time for us to change it.\n\nOur new Fuhrer, Speer, has decided that it is time to try opening trade with the rest of world, especially the Americans. If there is one way out of the never-ending race to achieve wealth for our people, this is it. And we must try our best to keep on it."
GER_a_meeting_in_the_dark_desc:0 "The Fuhrer is interested in setting a meeting, with the proper discretion, of course, with the American ambassador. Why he seeks this is not entirely known to us, but if we believe in him, it is surely to find a way to lift the embargo their country established against the Fatherland.\n\nLet's make sure it goes well. And carefully."
GER_the_truth_will_set_us_free_desc:0 "Two choices confront us now. The first choice is to be honest about our Fatherland. Our Fuhrer may want to not hold back on how we really are faring, and so, he may tell the Americans that he would come to the table with no secrets, seeking the best out of the terms they may offer.\n\nThe other one is to keep our secrets close to us. We lie to the Americans and hope that they will believe it. We only have to take one choice, and honesty might be the best policy."
GER_confrence_of_global_security_and_cocoperation_desc:0 "Our great German Fatherland is seeking to bring a beautiful proposal to the table with the Americans.\n\nThat proposal is the opportunity to have a conference with them, to invite them and talk to them about issues between us. But this conference too should serve us a purpose.\n\nThe end of the embargo is what we seek. Let us hope we receive what we seek indeed."
GER_the_reykjavik_accords_desc:0 "Our Reich shall come to Reykjavik to meet with the Americans. And there, we shall do our best to solve our issues with them together. And hopefully, once and for all.\n\nDuring that meeting, we are going to have to make compromises. There is a chance the Americans will ask a great deal out of us. Let us hope doing so will get them on our side. And nothing too drastic."
GER_resetting_the_dooomsday_clock_desc:0 "We have made a very important decision. And this should not cost us more.\n\nWe shall see to it that our nuclear arsenal is reduced, and that our capabilities shall be regulated. It is a serious compromise, indeed, but it would be one great step towards getting the Americans to become more friendly with us."
GER_helping_the_untermensch_desc:0 "Another agreement has been made. And that concerns our former property.\n\nWhat the Americans called slaves we shall treat more kindly. And hopefully that should show to them that we are more than willing to do what is right.\n\nAfter all, that is something we wished to do too. Let's just hope they don't rub that in our faces too much."
GER_america_first_desc:0 "It's a big sacrifice for anyone to let go of the first of everything they own or earn. And for our Reich, it is going to be our own sacrifice to let the Americans have a taste of the resources we now possess.\n\nSurely, while this means great reward for us, this too should mean that our new American friends will benefit."
GER_The_Fuhrer_Has_Spoken_desc:0 "Our Fuhrer has come out to the people and spoke to them about the deal. It has been done. Our great Fatherland has made a momentous agreement with the Americans. And finally, we have seen our Fuhrer do his best.\n\nNo matter how much one may oppose this now or support it, our Reich shall have to respect this. And live with it, it must."
GER_the_times_they_are_a_changing_desc:0 "The new treaty is taking effect. And as it did, change has come to our Fatherland. It is happening thanks to it, and for better or worse, our people experience it as they should experience it.\n\nBut thanks to this, we have struck another opportunity. The Americans have invited Schmidt to come to their cities. Let us accept this gesture of goodwill."
GER_the_city_that_never_sleeps_desc:0 "The Americans have invited Schmidt to pay a visit to the Big Apple. And there he shall go for our Fatherland, to see the sights of their most populous city! This is a great opportunity for our country's foreign minister to see what our American counterparts have to show for themselves. Let us not waste this invitation.\n\nGiving Schmidt the chance to visit that city shall be one step closer to becoming closer to our counterparts in the West. And letting him see New York for himself would surely be great for his pleasure."
GER_the_city_of_angels_desc:0 "The Americans have called Schmidt to the West Coast, bringing him to Los Angeles. He could see their museums, their piers, and their unique natural features. Although he may miss seeing Lady Liberty, Wall Street, and Central Park, it would be pleasing for him to see what lies to the Pacific.\n\nAlthough our former Japanese allies may have won some concessions from them, that is not our business. Let Schmidt enjoy the sights of this great city. Perhaps letting him lay his eyes on their beaches and letting him explore Hollywood could give him insights into the culture of our counterparts."
GER_wiping_our_hands_clean_desc:0 "Our Fatherland shall no longer have to deal with the horrific stains of wars, both within and without, and neither shall it deal with the memories of those who have once promised us the future but gave us ashes. And to show to the Americans that we have changed, we have washed ourselves clean.\n\nThey are beginning to appreciate us for who we are now and what we have become. We are born again. Our Fatherland shall be born again."
GER_a_dine_in_at_the_white_house_desc:0 "Our foreign minister has done well. And he has enjoyed his dinner at the White House. Things are looking good for both the Americans and our people.\n\nOur great Fatherland made sure this won't go to waste. Schmidt shall have signed the papers with the President, signing away together the embargo which has wedged itself between our two great countries."
GER_lying_congressional_style_desc:0 "We face a fork in the road. Two simple choices, tell the Americans the truth about our country. Or we can lie to them.\n\nIf we lie, we must make it realistic. We must present ourselves strongly. And while speaking the truth would be great, it might benefit them more than us.\n\nAfter all, it's natural to lie, but it's hard to tell the truth. And while it would set us free, would that give us money?"
GER_an_invitation_to_hamburg_desc:0 "Sending an invitation to our American counterparts is good. But inviting them to Hamburg is better than merely bringing them into the heart of our Fatherland.\n\nShowing them one of our largest cities would certainly impress them. And this would allow us to show some of the best of our country. And there, we would be free to discuss issues with their delegation. Let us hope that extending our hand to the West would be rewarded with their appreciation of German hospitality."
GER_relocate_the_protestors_desc:0 "We know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the American's arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things.\n\nThankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful. Speer and Gehlen have sent armoured trucks and men with guns into Hamburg, quickly and effectively taking care of the rioters and moving them elsewhere. At least for now, our faces are saved."
GER_accelerate_the_rebuilding_desc:0 "It is going to cost us money. But money is something that we can replace; time is something we cannot.\n\nIt is important for us to rebuild Hamburg as quickly as we can, no matter what. And no matter how much this may ask of us, it is better to do this than to disturb the Americans with reminders of our civil war.\n\nAccelerating the efforts of our Fatherland to restore the beauty of this great city shall be a priority."
GER_fill_the_mass_graves_desc:0 "We have buried many bodies here. But it isn't enough. Unfortunately for us, there are still some that remain.\n\nIt's going to take too long for us to get the ones that are still around in Hamburg taken care of. We have to get them out of sight. Quickly, or the Americans will see our shame, our human loss.\n\nAs long as we can find holes for these corpses and bury them deep, our guests will never have to complain nor worry about anything."
GER_shiny_happy_people_desc:0 "The war for the fate of our Fatherland has not been good to our people. And as a consequence, they cannot help but feel miserable and exhausted about things. We cannot allow this to be.\n\nAlthough Hamburg is one of many cities which has suffered from the pains of the Burgerkrieg, the Americans must not see how far our people have gone down with their attitudes. Let us make sure that we show our guests that we are capable of putting on our best smiles."
GER_a_night_in_wonderful_hamburg_desc:0 "The American delegates have come to Hamburg. And now, our great Fatherland has the opportunity to show to our former enemies, who are now here to sit down with us and talk peace and security, that our Reich is as wonderful as we wanted it to be.\n\nAlthough we had to hide some of the things we could not bear to leave lying around, at least we can warmly get our guests settled in for the coming talks. And for now, it is time for joy.\n\nLet's make sure they have a beautiful night."
GER_just_like_in_washington_desc:0 "We have done so much. We have to put away what should never be seen. And we have hoped that they would never realize what has changed.\n\nIt worked. And now we have them on our side. It's time for us to get ready for the best part of this show. Preparations for the journey over the Atlantic must be undertaken. "
GER_the_unity_fair_desc:0 "It would be all too easy to bring the Americans to our side. And we can't just beg them to end the embargo. That would certainly be terrible manners on our part.\n\nNo. Instead, let us make a spectacle. Yes, let us appeal to their people, not just to their government. And we have just the plan.\n\nA fair, for all the world to come and see, to experience and to remember, at Boston, would most certainly be our best shot at making the American people more agreeable to sitting down with us."
GER_once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood_desc:0 "Working with the Americans doesn't always mean maintaining a mentality centered around work alone. No, let us make sure that our counterparts can realize that we too appreciate some time off.\n\nAnd by this, we do mean that we appreciate cinema. And if we can get our American counterparts to enjoy some films with us, perhaps that will make things easier for them to digest during our talks.\n\nA film festival right in Hollywood should do the trick. If Norma could ask for a close-up, so can our Margit, Elke, and Marianne."
GER_fear_and_loathing_in_reno_desc:0 "Our American counterparts love their planes. We too love our planes.\n\nParticipating in one of their greatest air shows at Reno would be a fabulous opportunity for our Fatherland to display the best of what our brightest engineers and technicians have created. And it certainly would wow the Americans with our skill at the machine, our mastery of the engine, and our innovative spirit.\n\nYes, we shall present to them our finest jets. Behold! The screaming 88s!"
GER_a_night_to_remember_desc:0 "All those visits, all those wonders, and all those pleasures. All these things have come to an end. And now, it is time to make an impressive conclusion.\n\nFor look! Schmidt has received an invitation to dine at the White House with the American President! Isn't that something?\n\nThis is our country's chance at getting the Americans to sign away this terrible embargo. And for the good, not only of our country, but for them and the rest of the world. Truly, as they say, this shall be a night to remember."
GER_opening_the_doors_desc:0 "It is time for our Fatherland to persuade the Americans to lift their embargo. And it is also time for us to open the doors of Europe to the West, and for the West to do the same for Europe. We can no longer exist with a barrier between us.\n\nIt is best for us all to remove the wedge between us."
GER_the_sins_of_the_father_desc:0 "Before we can even sit at the same table with our partners from America, we have to show that we can go forward without Hitler's influence.\n\nWe are a new Germany, and to the Republican-Democratic party, we must help them see who we are now instead of who we were before.\n\nWhat we are now must not be tainted by who we were before."
GER_are_not_the_sins_of_the_son_desc:0 "Our Führer, Albert Speer, has never done anything wrong. He never involved himself with the ugliness which Hitler himself got into.\n\nUnlike him, our new Führer desires to make things right. This is what we believe, and that is what the world should too.\n\nThis is his way, and therefore our way, of setting ourselves apart from the legacy of our fathers."
GER_distance_ourselves_from_hitler_desc:0 "The name Adolf Hitler will forever echo through the grand halls of history, inspiring both hope and fear into those who hear it. The threads of fate weaved together the tapestry of this man's life, from the darkness of Vienna's filthy slums to the radiance of the Reichstag. His ascension to Führer of the Greater German Reich and saviour of the Aryan people is a monumental fragment of history, and to belittle his significance would be to deny reality itself.\n\nNonetheless, the Führer was but a man, and so too would it be foolish to deny his faults. Many within the Party refuse to acknowledge the flaws of their hero, but these attitudes must be altered if we are to progress as a nation. The question remains as such: should we completely destroy Hitler's cult of personality, or must the subject be tackled with a lighter touch?"
GER_death_to_the_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "The time has come to embrace total dehitlerization for the good of the German Reich. No longer shall the Party worship Hitler as a figurehead of National Socialism and messianic saviour of the Aryan race. It is our duty to acknowledge that Hitler was a mere man driven by power and prone to committing unspeakable actions, even against his own people whom he claimed so often to love. This drastic change in National Socialist thought will doubtless spark fury among the conservative wing of the NSDAP, but it is a risk we are willing to take."
GER_scattered_to_the_wind_desc:0 "Germany has been struck by a seismic political change, the reverberations of which will be felt for decades to come. The Hitler cult has been obliterated and all its traces scattered to the wind. To call this move controversial would be a gross understatement, and many Party comrades are raging against the administration's new position. Nonetheless, to linger on the mistakes of history would be a fruitless endeavour. We must avert our eyes away from the darkness of the past and instead embrace the bountiful future that awaits."
GER_hitler_acted_alone_desc:0 "Speer and his administration understand that Hitler was a flawed leader who ruled with poor judgement and enacted many amoral policies. Unfortunately for the Reich, our most stubborn Party comrades refuse to understand this, preferring to view the late Führer through rose-tinted lenses. While we cannot force the conservatives to embrace our viewpoint, it is within our power to inform the world. The truth is whatever we declare, and our truth is that Hitler acted alone in ordering atrocities. The world must believe that no one in the administration had any knowledge of Hitler's decision making, for the sake of Germany's future."
GER_a_better_light_to_stand_in_desc:0 "The German Reich stands on the precipice, bracing itself to take the leap of faith into a bright new era. We must demonstrate to the world that the current administration represents the sensible reformation of National Socialism, and that Hitler's Germany is locked away in the annals of history, never to return. By portraying Speer's administration as not only separate but morally superior to Hitler's, we may be able to form greater connections with the nations around us."
GER_a_new_reich_desc:0 "The Reich has taken a leap of faith from the shadowy darkness of the past into the light of a new day. Speer and his administration have successfully distanced themselves from the atrocities of Adolf Hitler, a man loathed by many nations across the world at large. With our open position on the late Führer clear to all, we have shown the world a new Germany with new values. The boiling anger within the Party is a threat to us all, but it may simmer down over time; the positive diplomatic consequences of our actions, however, shall last for decades to come."
GER_our_new_spitting_image_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off. As we desperately hoped, our desire to improve diplomatic relations with the wider world may soon be fulfilled. Many heads of state have praised Speer's position on Hitler to varying degrees of openness, and the foreign press we have intensively studied are producing mostly positive coverage. Even the great beast to our west, the United States of America, has responded well to Speer's administration distancing itself from Hitler, and the Republican-Democratic Party is reportedly eying our sudden surge in popularity with envy! We have presented a new face to the world, and the world likes what it sees."
GER_we_are_not_complicate_desc:0 "Germany cannot deny that many of its sons and daughters turned against Hitler. And Germany cannot deny that among them, there were some who desired his downfall and of those who believed in him.\n\nHowever, Germany must realize that one group above all has done the most to destroy everything.\n\nIt must realize that this group is the SS."
GER_in_the_mistakes_of_the_past_desc:0 "Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and the face of his infamous state of Burgundy, an artificial entity shaped out of the corpse of France and Belgium, is and was responsible for the stains which ruined Hitler's reputation.\n\nBut most of all, they are the ones who corrupted his party and his country. All the mistakes of the past are because of Himmler and his SS."
GER_fingers_pointed_at_himmler_desc:0 "Himmler is a criminal, and a trickster who wishes to take over the Reich for himself. His men too are minions we cannot forgive. We must set ourselves apart from them, and for the good of the Fatherland, we must make a decision!\n\nWe can either refuse recognition for him as part of our government, or we can start confronting him. One way or the other, we cannot let him continue to be a menace to the good future of our Fatherland!"
GER_no_compassion_for_himmler_desc:0 "The ties of our Fatherland to that traitorous pagan shall be severed. Completely cut off from us, this monster shall no longer benefit from our attention.\n\nLet him realize that we have had enough of him and of his schemes. Our Fatherland will no longer see him as one of our own.\n\nAnd with this in mind, the world will learn to let him rot."
GER_no_contact_order_desc:0 "Shorn of contact and information, the Himmlerite beasts will enjoy no help from us in creating their schemes. Thus weakened, the burgundian hydra will be easier to manage\n\This will be our way of cutting them off from us.\n\nThe Fatherland will jam their transmissions, eliminate their agents, and destroy their connections."
GER_no_mercy_for_himmler_desc:0 "Hitler made a mistake with this man. We will not make the same mistake again. Unlike our dear Führer, we will ensure that Himmler's state shall no longer see the light which comes from our Fatherland.\n\nWhile they may possess nuclear weapons, we will not be intimidated. We will seal them away, confronting them for the demons that they are."
GER_a_confrontational_policy_desc:0 "We will meet the Burgundians every step of the way; we will face these traitorous monsters down at every turn they take.\n\nGermany, our Fatherland, shall no longer tolerate inaction towards them. We will waste nothing in our efforts to spite them and keep them from succeeding.\n\nBy doing this, we become their worst enemy. But that is the price we will be happy to pay for the sake of our people."
GER_no_friends_in_the_black_state_desc:0 "Germany does not need friends in Burgundy, and Burgundy will never have any allies in Germany again. Forcing them to become friendless is our next move.\n\nThey may exist as they please, despite the hatred the world has for them, but we will make sure that their existence becomes a hell for them.\n\nIf they stand against us for what we believe, so will we oppose them for their betrayal of Germany and of National Socialism!"
GER_the_reich_stands_against_monsters_desc:0 "We will never, ever support monsters again. The Fatherland shall see to it that neither support nor sympathy nor forgiveness shall be extended to the hollow men who have sold themselves to Himmler and his Black State.\n\nNo longer are they to us the men they once were; they are nothing but evil fiends seeking to bring down what we all stand for. Against them, our people shall be!\n\nDas Vaterland toleriert keine Monster!"
GER_two_giants_together_again_desc:0 "It's evident that our new course will bring us in competition with the United States. However, we want this to be a "new" kind of struggle, one made between nations which respect each other, and fought on the field of trade and industry with clear rules and without people dying in a senseless war.\n\nIn order to bring our nations together, we shall propose to our former enemy a conference. This meeting, to be held in Toronto, will set the foundations for a rapprochement, and who knows, perhaps the end of the embargo which is slowly suffocating our economy?"
GER_turn_back_the_doomsday_clock_desc:0 "We have made a very important decision. And this should not cost us more.\n\nWe shall see to it that our nuclear arsenal is reduced, and that our capabilities shall be regulated. It is a serious compromise, indeed, but it would be one great step towards getting the Americans to become more friendly with us."
GER_more_rights_for_slaves_desc:0 "Another agreement has been made. And that concerns our former property.\n\nWhat the Americans called slaves we shall treat more kindly. And hopefully that should show to them that we are more than willing to do what is right.\n\nAfter all, that is something we wished to do too. Let's just hope they don't rub that in our faces too much."
GER_first_in_trade_desc:0 "It's a big sacrifice for anyone to let go of the first of everything they own or earn. And for our Reich, it is going to be our own sacrifice to let the Americans have a taste of the resources we now possess.\n\nSurely, while this means great reward for us, this too should mean that our new American friends will benefit."
GER_toronto_accords_desc:0 ""With the conference ended in resounding success, we can now proudly say that we have opened a new era for our two countries!

And of course, more workers means more spending, and more spending means more tax revenue.\n\nThis, above all else, is the most crucial step in our developing relationship with the Japanese."

No longer is the mere prospect of a meager job enough to attract the employment of a German labourer. Now many companies find themselves with no choice but to offer more to retain and grow their staff. More wages. More benefits. More paid overtime hours.\n\nAnd with this radical shift in the German labour market, we have seen the benefits of a workforce with more money in their pockets. Increased income tax revenue, increased sales tax revenue, and an increase in nearly all other forms of tax revenue as the German worker returns home after a laborious day with a heavier wallet than ever before."

As long as we have been in power, they have done their utmost to stymie Speer's efforts to create a Reich that both works without betraying what makes it the Reich. This cannot remain the case.\n\nThese men- Erhard, Schmidt, Kiesinger, and Tresckow- have long outlived their usefulness. They shall be given a choice- bow to the party line, or get out of the way. Whether their sense or their beliefs will prevail remains a mystery, but one way or another, Speer will not be challenged."
 SGR_gleichschaltung_forevermore_desc:0 "Due to the Gang's traitorous behavior, the idea of a Reich with free democracy has become an increasingly popular idea among the youth. These rebellious knaves are the same as the ones Speer used to take power all those years ago- still as rebellious, still as foolish, still as blinded by their goggles as they were in 1963. Their delusions will not be coddled- no, accepted- any longer.\n\nThere is one party, there is one Fuhrer, and there is one Reich. This is not a democracy. This is not a nation which will bend over backwards for Judeo-Bolsheviks and western pigs alike. We are Germany! We have stood as the power of Europe for years before, and with Speer's well placed reforms, we shall stand as the power of Europe for the rest of time!"
 SGR_ein_volk_desc:0 "The youth, as they have been for the last decade, are unhappy with Speer's way of doing things. Apparently, they thought that the Fuhrer was pleased to give in to the Gang's fantasies. As is tradition, they've decided to raise hell. This time, however, will be different.\n\nThe government no longer cares for these brats. Let them scream as long as they like. The people, by and large, will be behind the Fuhrer. National Socialism is the path forward for Germany, and it would do our people much good to remember that. Every good German man will be proud to call himself a Nazi. They shall wear the swastika with pride, and Germany will turn back towards its bright future."
 SGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "What is a Slav? A man? A human being, living and breathing, as we Aryans do? Or nothing more than an Untermensch, no more worthy than a good dog or abnormally productive than a cow? Schmidt and his gang may argue the former, but any good Aryan knows the truth. The Slav- and by extension, Eastern Europe- serves no purpose other than to serve the Aryan man. They are not slaves because we care for them, they are not slaves because the slave system only served to hinder Germany. It would be prudent to remind our people of this.\n\nUntil the Slav proves that he can lead himself into the future  rather than drag the rest of Europe down- something which seems quite unlikely- the Reich will take the lead in this endeavor. Even if we must take them kicking and screaming, we will take them, and they will work for a Europe free of the stain of Judeo-Bolshevism."
 SGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Germany is safe from western influence and bolshevik thought alike- for now. The battle, of course, is not yet finished. The sharks of liberalism and communism still circle the waters surrounding our boat, itching for the moment they believe they can strike. With the Gang at the helm, they very nearly had their chance.\n\nThe captain has reasserted his command. Albert Speer is ready to lead Germany into the future it truly deserves- one not of subservience to the Slav, or the Jew, or the capitalist, but one of leadership and power. A world in which the Reich once again dominates, a world in which the National Socialist dream can come true. The challenges on this path may be many, but we shall weather the storm, secure in our knowledge that National Socialism will keep us safe through the raging waters, now and forevermore."
 SGR_the_dream_come_true_auth_desc:0 "The impossible has happened. Helmut Schmidt has won out. In the greatest game of geopolitical cards ever played, Speer and Schmidt have dueled on the world stage, and Schmidt has emerged victorious-bloodied, battered, and bruised, but unquestionably victorious.With his negotiations with the Revolt a total success, and the Reich bent irreversibly towards the Gang's way of thinking, there seems to be no direction but up for the German reformists.\n\nWhere does Germany go from here? Who knows? Never before has so much power in the Reich been held in the hands of men like Schmidt, Erhard, Kiesinger, and Tresckow. With Speer relegated to figurehead status, the future has been blown wide open for a gentler, understanding, democratic Reich- one ready to finally ditch its dark past for the glory of the modern world.\n\nOne thing is certain - if the citizens of Germany thought that they'd seen an incredible amount of reform before, they haven't seen anything yet."
 SGR_the_house_of_cards_falls_desc:0 "The NSDAP has never been a particularly stable party, but the last years have been especially chaotic, even by their standards. Though the level of discontent is obviously nowhere near the levels seen on the verge of the Burgerkrieg, it is an undeniable fact that the party is splintering once again- the Dissenters are finally beginning to fully split from the Reformist and Reactionary wings of the party. If Speer was in charge, this would be an unmitigated disaster- one to be solved with extreme prejudice.\n\nHowever, Speer is not in charge. It more than suits our interests for the party to split- if anything, it would do us much good to hasten the breakup. The sooner the old party bureaucracy is out of the way, the better."
 SGR_the_shadow_government_desc:0 "In all but name, the Gang of Four controls the reins of power in Germany. Speer's role has been crushed down to only the most ceremonial duties, a mere figurehead to the powers behind the scenes. However, Albert Speer is still the Fuhrer. It is theoretically possible that he could stage a return to power- something he is undoubtedly plotting, giving the more than negative nature of the Gang's takeover.\n\nIn order to cut him off before he even gets the chance to try and return, we shall strengthen our position with important members of the Reich's bureaucracy that hold similar ideals as we do. If we are able to dominate the upper levels of government with men who dislike Albert Speer as much as the Gang, there will be no danger of him ever returning to real prominence."
 SGR_contact_popular_movements_desc:0 "The Gang's solidification of power is not merely contained to the inner Party bureaucracy. Outside of the Party, the shift in the Reich's policy has drawn all sort of dissenter's interests, seemingly intrigued by this new course that the Gang has set out. These dissenters, along with the previously mentioned allies in the upper ranks of the Reich, may be able to provide valuable legitimacy and credible ideas.\n\nAs such, a semi-formal conference has been scheduled to take place in Frankfurt, the center of movements for German democracy since the 1800's. With numerous big names invited to appear, this conference may set the course for the next stage of the Reich. It is for the best that we prepare."
 SGR_einigkeit_desc:0 "There's no easy way to put it- the Reich is dying. The systems that the German people have known and trusted for decades, despite their cruel, oppressive natures, are finally being torn down. Such a rapid shift, even after the years of reform instituted before the Slave Revolt, has thrown the people into a river of change without the knowledge of how to swim. They are scared, confused, and alone- something that we cannot allow to become the national mood, lest a tide of reactionary sentiment sweep us back out the door.\n\nWe shall be the angels to these shepherds, taking their hands and leading them in a unified, caring front into the future, past the gruesome history we've worked so hard to get away from. We shall take them to our own Bethlehem, where finally, a free Germany awaits us, and they will not be afraid. A new era is nearly at hand, and it is our duty to bring the German people to it."
 SGR_recht_desc:0 "The German people have been deprived of many, many things since 1933, but perhaps the most important one is justice. For decades, Nazi officials have gotten away with some of the most heinous crimes possible. Corruption, treason, murder, a thousand other acts that would put any average citizen in a penal labor camp for the rest of their days- all waved away, simply because of the armband these men proudly wore. Now, it is time to turn the tables on them.\n\nPerhaps it is poetic that many of the most important figures that stand in the way of freedom and democracy are blatant criminals. One could certainly find meaning in that. However, we are not looking for poetic metaphors- we are looking for the hand of the law to finally come crashing down on these traitor's heads. The judge's gavel will be the primary weapon of our new legal war, and these men will face justice for the acts that they have committed against so many."
 SGR_freiheit_desc:0 "Freedom is a long and bloody road, especially for a nation with autocracy as baked into its culture as Germany. The German people are used to having a strongman, whether Hitler or Speer, direct their nations for them, crush their freedoms in the name of their supposed "safety" or "self-interest". These were all fascist lies, and now the chance has come to cut the cancer out and replace it with a free, democratic Reich.\n\nIt will not be perfect- Lord knows how many times Erhard, Schmidt, Kiesinger, and Tresckow have erred. There will be rough patches, as there always are. Sacrifices will need to be made. It will not be an easy road away from the siren of fascism, but the light at the end of the tunnel- a Germany where all are free and equal, no longer forced to fear their government- is enough to keep the Gang toiling. They will toil until they drop, or until their dream is achieved.\n\nThere is much work to be done, and the Gang is ready to do it."
 SGR_a_new_era_desc:0 "Germany is undergoing yet another visible change; one of many that its already experienced this century.\n\n The Oil Crisis, combined with the great Slave Revolt has shown us that our our model of governance is outdated. Germany is running its nation and aligned partners like the great powers of the Victorian Era ran their personal spheres of influence. Our model is hopelessly outdated.\n\n The last two back to back crisis has proved without a doubt that we can not simply ignore the rest of the world. Like it or not, but if we are to retain our status as an influential and great power, we need to be able to work with others; not as a superior or overlord, but as equals.

 speer.1.desc:0 "From the steps of the Reichstag today, Speer has announced that he has finally secured his place as the Führer of Germany. Armed soldiers from Stauffenberg's 6th Panzer Division and hundreds of armed militia fighters who had taken him to Germania surrounded the Reich's new leader as he announced he would be bringing Germany into a new era of prosperity and enlightenment.\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands filled the streets in celebration for their new leader and an end to the most bloody conflict Germany has ever become embroiled in, some skirmishes still continue across the nation as the followers of Speer's enemies have refused to give up the fight, despite their losses, refusing to accept Speer as their next leader. Still, Speer's speech has reached acclaim, not only in Germany, as it has become the most televised broadcast out of the nation in decades, being especially well received in Germany.\n\n"It is not enough to dream of a strong Germany. We must believe in a strong Germany. We must strive for a strong Germany. We will shine a light in the dark, and be a beacon for our children and their children, as they remember us as the ones who made a strong, brave, beautiful new world for them to inherit."

 speer.2.desc:0 "The radical left wing of the Speerian faction began small and inconsequential, having no say in party policy and generally being relegated to sitting in the shadows.\n\nThis is no more, however, as the constant state of war in Germany has greatly encouraged radicalization, even among Speer's faction of idealists. Many have accused him of not going anywhere near far enough to try and win the war, or of being a secret Burgundian, or of attempting to sabotage his own movement from inside.\n\nWhile these claims are preposterous, many have rallied around them, and slowly yet surely a Communist and Socialist coalition has grown in the Speerians. It was unknown what exactly they planned until early this morning, when gunshots were heard near Speer's HQ. A coup."

It is imperative that we garner the support of the students, for their help is much needed against the ruthless and perseverant SS divisions possessed by Heydrich and the well trained armed forces units possessed by both Göring and Bormann.\n\nThe support of the students will, in fact, be a great boon for us as, while they are not a professional fighting force, they can tie up the resources of our enemies, which will lead us one step closer to victory..."

As more and more of the little remaining infrastructure becomes victim to various war efforts, food and supplies no longer move around, and the famine only gets worse, disease quickly following along with it.\n\nThis is the true beginning of what people are calling the German Anarchy, and the worst has yet to come."

Only one obstacle still stands to Speer taking power in the nation, and that is Speidel and his men in Germania. Still untouched by the war, Germania has remained relatively alive during this disaster, and Speidel, and his former commander turned second, Rommel, have been hailed as heroes for saving the city in the face of this conflict.\n\nNow, all that is needed is for them to stand down and allow Speer and his supporters to enter the city, a crucial last step. Whether they will stand down willingly or not, however, is up to them."

 speer.16.d:0 "Four men entered the battle for Germany's future, but most only thought there were three true contenders- Bormann, Goring, and Speer. The fourth, Heydrich, was widely seen as nothing more than a doomed breakaway, with no public support, little Heer support, and disconnected territory. Most discarded his candidacy from the start- certainly someone would crush him fast, and the nightmare would be over.\n\nUnfortunately, events have not gone the way we have expected. Heydrich is quickly gaining speed and momentum, and most recognize him as a real threat to take over Germany, despite the resistance of most of the people. As much as we hate our fellow competitors, we can all agree- Heydrich cannot be allowed to take control of the Reich, for he will certainly bring nothing but death and destruction to it.\n\nAs such, we have invited our challengers to a conference to negotiate a temporary "Anti-Heydrich Pact"- built not as a perfect solution to the Burgerkrieg, but as a means to stop Heydrich before he becomes too powerful for us to contain."

Ignoring the unsurprising hostility, it seems that Bormann will not enter a ceasefire.\n\nThis throws a wrench into our hopes of defeating Heydrich easily- though we can hope that our armies will defeat Heydrich while simultaneously locked in combat with each other, it will certainly be a challenge."

In a calm, conducted, yet vicious speech Holdine condemned 'Mister Speer' for his decision to abolish the Mother's Cross of Honour, claiming it but the latest in a series of unacceptable attacks against the German woman.\n\nThe speech was disrupted however as counter-protestors from the liberal feminist movement stormed onto the Plaza, wearing chains and chanting 'Slaves!' over and over, leaders declaring that this was the German woman the League desired. When the Orpo stepped in to prevent a violent clash between the two sets of protestors, controversy has exploded as when an arriving Orpo police car backfired, mimicking a gunshot, Holdine Goebbels slapped an Orpo officer who suddenly grabbed her, the microphone broadcasting that 'the Aryan woman does not need some man to protect her'."

Having attracted a core group of young dissatisfied German women to her leadership in chaos of the debate, Holdine publicly announced the formation of the Aryan-Feminist Movement.\n\nWhilst remaining strongly in the camp of National Socialism, the former poster girl of the Party delivered a fiery manifesto calling for total equality between men and women. According to the movement, Aryan women are as much warriors as Aryan men, capable of defending themselves and making their own decisions, with both genders providing an equally important role in the Reich and thus deserving of equal rights, even with the traditional gender roles being respected 'for the good of society'. The manifesto has drawn outrage from both sides of the debate, with demands for Holdine's Party membership to be revoked immediately."

If we are to help him, it would increase his chances of winning the Civil War. The question, however, is if we wish to aid any faction within the Civil War whatsoever.

 speer.200.t:0 "The Nuremberg Speech"
 speer.200.d:0 ""My people - sons and daughters of Germany. The trials we have faced over the past three decades have been greater than anything faced by any other nation in history. Never before has an empire defeated so many foes and risen to such heights, only to be laid low again in such a short period of time. Since the passing of our beloved Führer, our suffering has only increased with each passing day. Thirty years ago, none could possibly have imagined that such privation and misery would befall the German people - yet, here we stand, knee-deep in the blood of our own kin."\n\n"How could it have come to this? How could we, the most noble and brotherly of nations, tear ourselves apart so suddenly and violently? The answer is plain for the rest of the world to see, but we ourselves have been blinded by petty rivalries and the stagnation of our glory. Germany: we failed. We failed to see the writing on the wall, to accept that the old ways served us no longer. We failed to remember that National Socialism is a movement of the people - not a rigid, dogmatic tool of bureaucrats, militarists and purist fanatics!"\n\n"People of Germany, we cannot - will not - return to the same path that led us to the brink of destruction once before. The time has come for change - change we can believe in! National Socialism and its representatives must serve the people first, and I swear that it shall! No more will you be asked to die for reasons you do not understand. No more will you be deprived of your bread by a faceless, stone-hearted bureaucrat. No more will the black stain of fanaticism be welcome in our great nation. The People's War is ended - now begins the People's Reich! Sieg heil!""

 speer.201.d:0 "Though the war is over, still the Fatherland suffers. To speak of 'the scars of war' is erroneous; Germany is rent apart, with the lifeblood of the nation dripping endlessly from gruesome, gaping wounds. To deal only with scars would be a comparative luxury. Instead, we find ourselves cleaning up after one of the worst civil wars in European history. Not since the 30 Years' War has Germany been so thoroughly devastated and deprived.\n\nIn every city, lines of citizens awaiting their rations stretch for block after block. Electricity is still completely cut off in several large areas, rendering much of our infrastructure useless and communication across the nation impossible. In regions where the fighting was most intense, even running water is a rarity. Living standards were already low before the Bürgerkrieg - now they are virtually nonexistent.\n\nTo alleviate this unprecedented humanitarian crisis, the Führer and his government have greenlit the immediate distribution of stored supplies to the people. Anything the military has no use for will also be bundled into this aid package. Food, water, medicine, fuel - if it has value and is not a weapon, the people need it. Of all the tragedies to befall Germany, none could possibly surpass our current situation. Enough of this nonsense talk of austerity and Spartanism; Germany cries out for salvation, and the Führer will deliver it unto them no matter the opposition, such is his love for the people."
 speer.201.a:0 "Thank you, my Führer."
 speer.202.t:0 "Show their Crimes"
 speer.202.d:0 "Though their followers have been killed, imprisoned or brought to heel, the legacies of Bormann, Göring and Heydrich remain, knives in Germany's back. In time, as their supporters are converted or weeded out, these painful memories will fade - but perhaps that's not enough. All of these claimants to the Führership commanded immense respect and popularity among the populace. Exposing their dealings and crimes through state media and public testimony would be a wise move, but attempting to discredit all of them at once would arouse suspicion.\n\nBormann's conservatism, ruthlessness and devotion to Nazism represented the total anathema of what Speer's supporters stand for. He spent much of the past three decades spreading his poison, infecting most of the NSDAP. Rooting out this rot from the Party would go a long way towards decreasing internal resistance to reform. Bormann was always careful to operate within the bounds of the law, but still inspired fear and hatred in many of his subordinates; now that he is gone, they might be more willing to testify against his memory.\n\nGöring had always enjoyed wide popular support due to his status as a war hero, but the greater threat by far is his former support base in the Wehrmacht. Owing to our great victories in the Second World War, the Wehrmacht remains a defining part of German culture and society. Still, their militarism is a clear and present danger to the Reich, serving only to turn yet more nations against us. Thankfully, Göring has a long record of illicit financial activities - activities that would ruin his reputation if they were to be exposed.\n\nFinally, there is Heydrich. The SS might be widely loathed, but Heydrich himself managed to retain a positive image following the West Russian War due to Hitler's high opinion of him, his reputation for decisiveness and his Spartan discipline. Obviously, admiration for him might quickly morph into admiration for Himmler, and we cannot afford to have Burgundian fifth columnists active in Germany. Exposing him while memories of the war are still fresh in peoples' minds could destroy any pro-SS sentiments for good.\n\nWhom shall we bury in history?"

Had he been more alert, he might have realized that the armed men outside his door were Gestapo officers possessed of absolute loyalty to the new Führer. Gagged, blindfolded, cuffed and unceremoniously bundled into the back of a waiting car, Lorenz had struggled and thrashed all the way from his home to the Special Court set up in the local NSDAP headquarters.\n\nWhen he was thrown into a cold steel chair before a known Speerite judge, Lorenz finally comprehended his predicament. His bindings removed, he loudly and insistently proclaimed his innocence in the few seconds before someone struck him over the head with a truncheon. He recovered just in time to hear the verdict: "In accordance with the Führer's directives, this court finds you guilty of treason, homosexuality and Bolshevik sympathies. The sentence is death."\n\nHauled from the Special Court by balaclava-wearing guards, none present would ever forget Lorenz' screamed protests as he was dragged out behind the court, put up against a brick wall and shot twice in the head with a P38. Thus began the Great Purge, and the end of the Reich's fifth columnists."

 speer.204.t:0 "The Erhard Plan"
 speer.204.d:0 ""What's this? You want to change our price controls?" Speer raised a skeptical eyebrow as he glanced at Erhard over the top of his proposal sheet.\n\nErhard shook his head and plucked a fat cigar from between his lips. "No, my Führer. Read it again - I don't want to change them, I want to abolish them. Price controls have never prevented inflation, and the black markets have been sucking the life out of our commercial sector for over ten years. We aren't going to dig ourselves out of his hole if we keep rejecting sensible free-market principles on... well, principle."\n\nSpeer was silent for a moment, eyebrows furrowing as he squinted at the tiny text more closely. Erhard shifted in his chair and replaced his cigar, taking a deep, satisfied puff. Suddenly, Speer's eyes stopped flicking back and forth - then widened. "Reset the Reichsmark? Are you telling me we should..."\n\n"Withdraw it from circulation. All of it. Then issue new notes and coins. The first batch is ready for distribution already, and banks in East Prussia and the Rhineland are prepared to start accepting the old currency. It will - let me finish, my Führer - give our citizens the purchasing power they've lacked ever since the crash in the 50's. Once the OFN embargo ends..."\n\nSpeer looked equal parts intrigued and mortified. "What do you mean the emb-"\n\nErhard flicked away the stub of his cigar. "You ARE planning to end the embargo, aren't you? Haven't you already spoken with Schmidt about this?"\n\n"Yes, but not-"\n\n"Good. The sooner imports start up again, the sooner we'll see quality of life begin to increase. I assure you, my Führer, that you will see progress not a day after that embargo is lifted." Erhard rose to his feet with a groan of exertion and gathered up his papers. "Now, I really must be going, my Führer. I have a dozen bankers and five CEOs to meet with before the day is out." With a lazy salute, and an almost-forgotten "Heil!", Erhard was gone, leaving Speer with a book-sized proposal and far too many numbers for his liking.\n\n"
 speer.204.a:0 "Quite the character..."
 speer.205.t:0 "Not This Time"
 speer.205.d:0 "It has been many years since German wives have been seen carrying full bags of groceries home - so long, in fact, that the sight of such made headline news across the Reich. In homes throughout Germany, families have been busying themselves clearing out unused cupboards to make room for weeks' worth of food. Once, a purse full of marks would barely feed one person for a day, let alone five. Now, the same amount of money can feed a family for a fortnight or more. One has yet to hear parents scolding their children for over-stuffing themselves, given that activity has quickly become a favorite pastime of the long-deprived German masses.\n\nFood is not the only thing Germans find themselves truly enjoying once more; electronics, cars and luxury goods have all become much more affordable. Many a household has recently been graced with a new television, while pedestrian congestion has greatly easy as the number of citizens owning private transport has increased massively. Petrol companies, in particular, are quite pleased with this development. Businesses big and small are finally turning a profit, and some semblance of prosperity is returning to the least devastated parts of the Reich.\n\nThis upturn must not be overstated, however, as Erhard constantly reminds the Führer. While many citizens have risen above the poverty line, many more remain beneath it, lacking the means to actually benefit from the renewed Reichsmark. Charity can only achieve so much, and there remains much to do if Speer hopes to elevate the working classes from their depression."
 speer.205.a:0 "It's a start."
 speer.206.t:0 "The Schmidt Proposal"
 speer.206.d:0 "Helmut Schmidt entered the Führer's office with a slightly timid "Heil!" and a rather hasty salute, looking suspiciously out of practice to Speer's eyes. Here, then, was the man who would redeem the Reich on the world stage; an impossible task to many, but not to one as ambitious as Speer.\n\nSpeer was careful to shake Schmidt's hand before the two sat, smiling slightly as he did so. "Schmidt," he said warmly. "Good to finally greet you somewhere more appropriate. The Chancellery meeting rooms aren't nearly secure enough, are they?"\n\n Schmidt nodded and smiled nervously at the implication. Certainly, there were more than a few men in the Party who would happily burst in waving a pistol if they knew the extent of what the Gang of Four was planning. Still, he said nothing, prompting Speer to clear his throat and lean forwards, looking distinctly businesslike. "Now, Schmidt - I understand you have an outline for dealing with our present diplomatic situation. I'm sure you're aware that we've already seen some positive developments on that front, but Erhard believes that we need something concrete to show our good intentions to the world."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," replied Schmidt, quickly composing himself. "Ah, a sort of 'whirlwind tour', as the Americans say. Straight to every capital that matters right now: Washington, Rome, Ankara, Tokyo, and so on. I'd undertake this myself, of course, since I'm an unknown quantity and can make a fresh impression on our old friends. The Pakt can wait, and obviously China, India and so on aren't priorities right now. Is this agreeable, my Führer?"\n\nSpeer nodded and smiled - genuinely, this time. "Excellent work, Schmidt. We're of two minds, clearly." The Führer rose from his seat, the sign that his Foreign Minister had the stamp of approval and was dismissed. "Let me know when you're planning to depart, and make sure you keep myself and the cabinet up to date on your progress. I leave the rest up to you. Best of luck, Helmut.""
 speer.206.a:0 "Time for a diplomatic makeover."
 speer.207.t:0 "Beyond the Atlantic"
 speer.207.d:0 "History was made today, as the President of the United States of America welcomed a German dignitary to the White House. Our Foreign Minister, Helmut Schmidt, was not received warmly as a representative of an OFN nation might have been, but the fact that there was no passive hostility on the President's part is surely a good sign. Schmidt was all smiles - no doubt a strange sight to many Americans after decades of hostile relations between our two countries.\n\nThe real coup Schmidt scored during his visit was an address to the Senate. Initial fears on our part were quickly allayed when a recording was delivered to Germany for broadcast on state television. He began with: "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your most cordial reception and kind words of greeting." A standard diplomatic opening, but Schmidt's warmth of voice and character made clear his sincerity. He went on to say: "This is my first expedition as Foreign Minister of the Greater German Reich, and I must express my admiration for the authority and dignity that this great nation displays in every action and every hour of its existence.\n\nSchmidt's schedule did not permit a tour of major cities as he initially requested before setting out, but the Führer was doubtful that such a request would be granted by the Americans anyway.  Considering we nuked them only twenty years ago, Schmidt's visit has been a resounding success and a great diplomatic victory for the Reich."
 speer.207.a:0 "There's hope for us yet."
 speer.208.t:0 "Neighbors at Home"
 speer.208.d:0 "Helmut Schmidt's diplomatic adventure continues, with visits to Rome, Ankara, Madrid, Stockholm and Helsinki. The Reich's image has suffered immensely in Europe - not merely because of the war, but also due to the economic crash that killed much of the continent's economy and plunged our trading partners into depression. The ready visibility of the Bürgerkrieg and the less admirable aspects of Hitler's reign have made us a pariah despite being the unquestioned ruler of northern and eastern Europe.\n\nSchmidt could never hope to repair our image in a single trip, but the first steps towards a long-needed thaw in relations have finally been taken - something Hitler would never have deigned to attempt. No doubt many of our neighbours question whether this move towards openness and cordiality is genuine. Such a lack of trust is unfortunate, but more than understandable, as our Führer put it to the Reichstag.\n\nStill, the importance of this diplomatic defensive operation cannot be understated. We have been isolated for decades, feared and loathed as an 'evil empire' of the north... like something out of a fantasy novel! Hopefully, Europe will begin to recognize our good intentions in time - as well as overlook anything they don't like about us in the name of Realpolitik."
 speer.208.a:0 "They will learn in time."
 speer.209.t:0 "In the Land of the Rising Sun"
 speer.209.d:0 "The Japanese have never disguised their distrust and even outright loathing for us in the past two decades. Our alliance in the Tripartite Pact was born of little more than convenience and deterrence against the United States, which became moot once the Japanese declared war on them and Hitler dragged us into it. As a rival fascist power, the Japanese naturally see us as a threat and a challenge to their rule - never mind the fact that our spheres of influence barely overlap at all. Our recent friendly overtures towards their arch-enemy may actually have made this enmity even worse.\n\nStill, Schmidt had a job to do, and performed it admirably given the circumstances. Welcomed to the Diet by the Prime Minister - though snubbed by the Emperor - he made an impassioned speech calling for an end to 'senseless rivalry' and for the Japanese to 'recognize our goodwill and peaceful intentions towards the Empire of Japan'. He was met with polite, if somewhat muted applause. To be expected, of course, but at least he wasn't given the silent treatment.\n\nThe Führer remains skeptical that relations with the Japanese will ever be normalized, but this was a necessary step to take in our journey towards a positive image on the world stage. If we cannot be seen as willing to reconcile with even our most vicious rival, we will never be trusted as a global actor."
 speer.209.a:0 "That could have gone worse."
 speer.210.t:0 "Enemy of my Enemy"
 speer.210.d:0 ""The United States," Speer finally said, opening his eyes and setting his hands down on his desk. "You're right on this count, Schmidt. We need their economic clout on our side."\n\nSchmidt breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. "Thank you, my Führer. I promise you, this is the right path. They're... well, they're normal."\n\nSpeer chewed his lip, looking a little skeptical. "Hmm. True, but they won't stop trying to subvert our interests. Don't forget that we've been on hostile terms for decades now, and that history won't go away just because you enjoyed some applause while you were over there."\n\n"I know, my Führer," Schmidt replied with a slightly offended edge to his voice. "But they also operate in a manner we're more than familiar with, and our two societies are more alike than they are different. The Japanese, though? Trying to build normal relations with them, even if it's not totally futile, might just make them more confident in their own broken system. Can you imagine if we got dragged into another war because of them? If you ask me, we should keep them at arm's length, my Führer."\n\nSpeer nodded and scratched his chin. "Yes, I understand, but still... the Japanese still match the Americans in their military might. Isn't there some value in a deterrent?"\n\n"Deterrent? My Führer, forgive my frankness, but we already have a deterrent - it's called our nuclear arsenal. Conventional armies don't have the clout that they used to. Trust me, Erhard is right; the economic benefits of trade with the United States will far outweigh anything the Japanese can offer, and we can't be seen to associate with the Japanese if they take a turn towards aggression again."\n\n"I have already made the decision, Schmidt," Speer remarked, relaxing a little. "Don't fret. Tell your men at the foreign office to get to work, and contact Erhard too. We still have a long way to go before we start seeing Fords on the Autobahn.""

 speer.211.d:0 ""Japan," Speer finally said, glancing at Schmidt to gauge his reaction. As expected, it was one of disappointment and no small amount of horror. Speer had known what to expect, but the expression on the Foreign Minister's face still hurt a little.\n\nSchmidt ground his teeth for a moment before leaning forward and locking his fingers together to keep from balling his fists. "My Führer, the Japanese don't have anything to offer us. The Americans have so much more that would benefit our economy."\n\nSpeer took a long time to reply. He stood from his desk and wandered over to the window, gazing out across the concrete skyline he had shaped decades ago. "I know, Schmidt," he finally said, not turning back to look at his subordinate. "But I'm not thinking merely of the economy. The United States won't stop their covert activities against us just because of a few trade deals. We need a substantial counterbalance to their military."\n\nSchmidt sputtered. The sound of his chair scraping against the polished floor as he stood upright stung the Führer's ears. "We have a nuclear arsenal that could flatten every city in North America and then some! Adding Japan's stockpile to that won't help to ease global tensions, Speer!"\n\nThe Führer's face darkened at the mention of his name in anger. "I've made my decision, Schmidt, and you had your tour. We can still have normal relations with the Americans, just not... not the kind you clearly have in mind." He turned to face Schmidt, who had folded his hands behind his back to hide their shaking. "That will be all, Herr Schmidt. You are dismissed."\n\nThe Foreign Minister didn't even bother to salute as he turned and stalked from Speer's office. Hopefully, he would see the wisdom of a move towards Japan in time."
 speer.211.a:0 "Hopefully..."
 speer.212.t:0 "We Are Not Alone"
 speer.212.d:0 "Reinhard Gehlen was not an impressive man to behold. Thin-faced with prominent ears, he was not the sort of fellow one would expect to hold a tremendously successful record as former head of Foreign Armies East, a military intelligence unit active during the war against the Soviets. Nor could he be counted as a particularly dedicated ideologue. What he was, however, was loyal, ruthless and utterly dedicated to his nation, having continued his own intelligence operations against the Bolsheviks even after their defeat. In Speer's estimation, he was not only brilliant, but also a true German patriot, which was why he had been invited to the lofty halls of power to discuss a certain proposal of his.\n\nSpeer relaxed a little, sensing nothing but respectful deference from the neatly-dressed man with his quaint bowler hat. "So, Herr Gehlen," he said, steepling his fingers. "I understand that on top of all this information you've brought me, you have an idea for how to deal with the matter of internal security. Please, speak your mind."\n\nGehlen hesitated for a moment before visibly relaxing and leaning onto the desk. "My Führer, it's no secret in intelligence circles that you are seeking to rein in the Gestapo and Abwehr, if I may be so bold. They are, indeed, in poor shape. They could neither prevent the civil war, nor rein in the dissident factions within the Reich."\n\nSpeer's face remained inscrutable. "Go on.""After the war, the Americans changed tack. Their wartime organization, the OSS, became the foundation of the CIA. They learned from their mistakes, adjusted accordingly and now they're drastically outpacing us in the field of intelligence. The same goes for the Japanese, as well as for every second-rate power in the world. We need something else - a new intelligence agency for the modern era."\n\nSpeer pondered this for a moment. "Interesting idea. Do you have anything more concrete for me?"\n\nGehlen nodded. He hauled his briefcase up onto the desk and clicked it open, producing an over-stuffed manila envelope with 'Reichsnachrichtendienst' scrawled on the front. "I do indeed, my Führer. Would you like to know more?""

 speer.213.t:0 "A Moment of Time"
 speer.213.d:0 "I wondered, as I often did in those days, how history might regard me. Outwardly, and to the rest of the world's estimation, I would have no choice but to be remembered as the great liberal Führer. For weeks after the civil war, I could look out the window of my office in the Reich Chancellery and see the crowds of well-wishers packing the plaza below. From my lofty perch, they appeared a great, seething mass on the busiest days. Individuals melted away, assimilated into the great din of humanity. Unable to pick out their faces, I was aware in those moments that this was 'people power' made manifest - that same tide that had swept my predecessor into power and changed the fate of Germany forevermore. It was impressive, mighty, and utterly terrifying. They chanted my name, saluted my presence and demanded of me things I could never be certain of delivering in those troubled days.\n\nMy thoughts after those occasions invariably turned inwards. Far from the adulation of cheering crowds, within the very buildings I had designed for the glory of the Reich, the Party was gathering strength. The post-war legal inquiries carried out by the Gestapo had sapped its strength, but it remained the largest power bloc in the Reich. The workers and disaffected youth might have outnumbered them a thousand fold, but the Party held power second only to myself. If I wholeheartedly followed the lead of my cabinet and embraced the popular movement that claimed to have my full support, I would permanently alienate this pillar of stability for the Reich. On the other hand, moving too close to them might have undermined my popular support, owing to their highly conservative agenda that I would need to adhere to.\n\nTo admit the complexity of this situation, even in writing, is difficult. But I must preserve my words for posterity, so that future generations will understand my choice. Perhaps it will be centuries before these words are seen, but no secret of this magnitude can be concealed forever."

"Some of these groups... I'm sure the Gestapo weeded them out, root and stem, thirty years ago."\n\n"I'm positive, my Führer. It's likely that many junior members of such organizations were beneath the Gestapo's notice at the time. I wouldn't be surprised if they kept to their beliefs in secret all these years."\n\n"I trust you, Herr Gehlen, but this just seems beyond belief. Look at..." he paused a moment, eyebrows rising. "Antifaschistische Aktion? Now, really, that's... Hitler spared no expense in rooting out every known communist in Germany. You're telling me that they survived all this time?"\n\nGehlen shook his head. "No, my Führer. I believe that to be a copycat organization. We still find banned literature in the hands of dissident cells - I wouldn't be surprised if some more radical members of the student movement have turned to Bolshevism for some inane reason." He almost spat the sentence out, not even bothering to hide his open disgust at such treason.\n\nSpeer continued scanning the list. Then - his breath caught, as his eyes did, on the final name listed. Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. Speer didn't recognize the name straight away, but something about it seemed... ah. Of course. The SPD paramilitary, with its fluttering tricolor and bizarre mixture of military men and well-groomed politicians. Attached to the organization's brief was a name, which for reasons well within Speer's understanding rattled him to the core.\n\n"Spartakus?" Speer looked up at Gehlen, horrified comprehension dawning on his face. He knew his history well enough to understand. "Do you mean to say that..."\n\n"We've yet to determine the significance of that moniker, my Führer. It could be misdirection. However, yes, it is possible that it means exactly what it implies."\n\nOne could have heard a pin drop in the Führer's office. Speer sputtered.

Petrol companies, in particular, are quite pleased with this development. Businesses big and small are finally turning a profit, and some semblance of prosperity is returning to the least devastated parts of the Reich.\n\nThis upturn must not be overstated, however, as Erhard constantly reminds the Führer. While many citizens have risen above the poverty line, many more remain beneath it, lacking the means to actually benefit from the renewed Reichsmark. Charity can only achieve so much, and there remains much to do if Speer hopes to elevate the working classes from their depression."

 speer.413.t:0 "IG Farben Dismantled"
 speer.413.desc:0 ""May I know the reason why you summoned me, Reichsminister?"\n\nLudwig Erhard looked at his interlocutor, so similar to him and yet so different. Hermann Josef Abs was smoking his same brand of cigars, and his eyes mirrored Erhard's: cold, calculating, merciless. This, however, was where the similarities ended: unlike the president of the IG Farben, the Reichsminister actually had ideals, and this made the difference.\n\n"I called you in order to notify you the imminent dismantlement of IG Farben. It will be broken into its constituent companies, each to become a competitor in a free-market economy"\n\nThere, he had dropped the bomb. He was prepared: Abs would scream at him, the two would scream at each other, until he would leave, defeated. Therefore, it was difficult to rein in his surprise when he heard his rival's words.\n\n"I see, Reichsminister. Thank you for what you are doing for the Reich"\nErhard's jaw stopped short of falling to the ground, and Abs chuckled.\n"I can see your surprise, but your fears are unfounded"\n"I know that you are trying to abolish slavery and build a new, competitive Germany based around free market and positive competition. I wholeheartedly agree with you, and I'll tell you more: I have tried several times to reduce IG Farben's reliance on slaves, but the others in the Board of Directors always objected, so I'm glad that you took the initiative"\n\nFinally, Erhard recovered from the shock enough to shake hands with Abs when he stated his need to participate to a board meeting. As soon as he was back on his stuffed chair, he started reflecting upon what he had heard: Abs was lying - that he was sure of - but why? What could bring a man who had no qualms in sending thousands to their deaths for a couple millions Reichsmarks to suddenly support the abolition of slavery? Something was wrong, but he couldn't yet put his head around it."

 speer.414.desc:0 "Edmund Geilenberg entered the top office in the Reichswirtschaftsministerium as one enters his home. As head of the largest state-owned industrial conglomerate in the Reich, he held more power in his hand than the entire ministry put together. Inside that office, however, was someone who would reverse the roles, once and for all.\n\n"Reichsminister" came Geilenberg's polite, if a bit haughty salute.\n\n"Wehrwirtschaftsführer" was Ludwig Erhard's equally polite, and equally haughty answer.\n"I'm sure you already know the reason for your summon. You have too many contacts within my ministry to feign ignorance" Erhard immediately went to the point. Geilenberg nodded, distaste evident in his face, and that was enough.\n"In light of the new economic policy, Reichswerke is to be dismantled, and its constituent companies restored as independent actors within a free market"\n\nGeilenberg had known the day would come, and for a moment his face contorted in anger. He was losing his power, his position, everything he had worked for during and after the war. However, he knew his position: he was no Abs, but a functionary put there by the government to oversee a state-owned company.\n"I understand. I will obey my orders" was his only answer, anger replaced by defeat.\n\nErhard nodded curtly. Part of him had hoped for a bit more resistance, but Geilenberg was no fool. He was already calculating how to cut his losses, and by giving his acceptance he had already secured his first point. The minister wasn't keen on doing this, but appearances needed to be saved: "Thank you. For your service to the Reich, you'll be assigned as chairman to one of the new companies. I'm sure you will keep working hard for the good of the nation"\n\nGeilenberg nodded, his face neutral, then the two shook hands and the former Wehrwirtschaftsführer left Erhard's office."

 speer.415.desc:0 ""This is impossible! There must be another way!"\n\nEveryone in the Reichswirtschaftsministerium could hear the loud voice coming from Reichsminister Ludwig Erhard's office, and everyone knew who it belonged to. Friedrich Flick was a powerful man, and very much used to meeting important ministerial officers to ensure his many companies would get what they wanted, be it a tender, a tax discount or an exclusive deal on a conquered region's manpower.\n\n"There will be no other way, and I didn't call you here to negotiate. Daimler-Benz shall be dismantled, and its member companies restored as independent actors in a free market." Erhard's voice was calm but final. He had prepared for this moment, and now he wouldn't let anything get into his way.\n\n"Reichsminister, I'm sure there is another way. There is always another way..." Flick's voice changed tone, becoming mellifluous and almost sickeningly sweet.\n"I'm sure you are a man of refined tastes... Perhaps we could find an accomodation? A deal between fellow businessmen?"\n\nErhard smiled. He knew the sniveling bastard would have tried to bribe him: he always had his way before, and expected him to be the same as all the others who preceded him behind his desk.\n"Oh, I'm sure we can find a deal" he said smiling, but Flick's predatory smile was cut short by the sound of a recorder playing.\n\n"Reichsminister, I'm sure there is another way. There is always another way... I'm sure you are a man of refined tastes... Perhaps we could find an accomodation? A deal between fellow businessmen?" the recorded voice of the entrepreneur was crystal clear, and its owner recoiled as if bit by a snake.\n\n"You wouldn't dare-"\n\n"Here's my deal. You get out from my office right now, and don't oppose the dismantlement, and in exchange my magnanimous self won't have you sentenced to a labor camp for trying to bribe a minister of the Reich."\n\nFive minutes later, Ludwig Erhard was still laughing in his empty office."

 speer.416.t:0 "Siemens Dismantled"
 speer.416.desc:0 "Ernst von Siemens entered the top office in the Reichswirtschaftsministerium, a neutral expression on his face. He knew, of course, the reason for this summon: he was not a fool, and while part of him had secretly hoped for this moment to come, another part of him - the cold, calculative part that any serious entrepreneur needs in order to survive - couldn't help feeling dejected.\n\n"Reichsminister" came Geilenberg's polite, if a bit cold salute.\n\n"Wehrwirtschaftsführer" was Ludwig Erhard's equally polite, but perhaps a bit less cold answer.\n\nVon Siemens exhaled, then looked in the minister's eyes: "There's no need for formalities, Herr Erhard. It doesn't take a genius to know why I have been called here: a clean cut is better than a game of cat and mouse"\n\nLudwig nodded. Unlike all others,  Wehrwirtschaftsführer von Siemens had been a steadfast - if interested - ally in his reforms. Together, they had worked to reduce the need for slaves in the other conglomerates, and the entrepreneur had used his influence to protect the minister from economic backlash on the other companies' part. Still, free market didn't admit exceptions, and they both knew that.\n"In light of the new economic policy, Siemens is to be stripped of its privileges, and will - from now on - operate as a normal company in a free market"\nWhen von Siemens looked at him in surprise, Erhard chuckled: "You must have come here expecting dismantlement, didn't you? It's almost a pity Siemens is too tightly-knitted to be broken down, and not big enough to pose a threat to fair competition: consider yourself lucky..."\n\nErnst von Siemens felt once again the two parts of his mind agitating. One was relieved that the blow had proven much lighter than expected, while the other was already lamenting the losses: still, he decided to listen to the first, if only this once.\n"Thank you, Reichsminister" he said, for then excusing himself. The two shook hands, then the office returned silent."

SpeerSAW.1.d:0 "The Führer's office, unlike the rest of the Reichskanzlei, is quiet, but far from inactive. Behind the heavy engraved doors, a meeting is being held, one that will decide the very future of Africa.\n\n"With all due respect, herr Tresckow, investing our limited resources in a desperate conflict started by a fool is a risk we can't afford so soon after we almost lost everything in a civil war!" says Helmut Schmidt.\n\nAlbert Speer sighs: they had been going on like this for almost an hour. "Please, Reichsminister Schmidt, elaborate on your thoughts" comes his tired question.\n"Mein Führer, while I understand the Feldmarschall's train of thoughts, we had a civil war mere months ago. If we don't win quickly, it might cripple the reconstruction effort, or worse! My proposal is simple: we can send help to the Reichskommissars to save face, but we won't commit fully to the war. We'll use this as a bargaining chip with the Americans, stalling the war until the outcome is favorable: the Americans will be the winners, but we won't be the losers, and they may even show their gratitude later..."\n"I disagree with herr Schmidt" von Tresckow's replies, incensed: "The Americans will exploit any weakness we show, and we must show none. Our relationship with the USA may change in the future, but for now they are our enemies, and we need to show that we are still a superpower!"\n"Go on, Feldmarschall" came Speer's interested reply.\n"Mein Führer, my plan of action is as follows: we send our Reichskommissars all the troops and supplies they need, while at the same time denying we are at war with the Americans. They won't be able to protest, as they are doing the same as us, and if we manage to prevail, they won't make the same mistake twice in future negotiations!"\n\nBoth plans are sound, and the choice is difficult.

Another week, another meeting, another two hours of hearing his ministers quarrel about the strategy in this damn war. This time, however, the situation is different: the war is quickly evolving, and a final choice needs to be done, even he knows it. Dreading the next hour, the Führer coughs, distracting the two from their discussion: "Reichsminister Schmidt, Feldmarschall von Tresckow, make your arguments one final time: we need to decide now"\n\n"Easy done, mein Führer. Honestly, most if this isn't my work, but Reichsminister Erhard has devised a plan to ensure we can limit our losses as much as possible. To put it simply, we'll stall the war as long as we can, and liquidate all possible assets before retreating: we'll load up all extracted resources and bring them to Germany, evacuate the personnel, transfer all remaining supplies, sell state-owned companies and shares and drain all funds from the Reichskommissariaten. Once we have secured as much as we could, we'll abandon Africa altogether"\n\n"On one thing I agree with herr Schmidt" begins von Tresckow, "keeping Deutsch-Afrika may cost us more than any resource we are gaining now. Still, if we leave our possessions there, we'll do it when and how we want: we won't be dictated any kind of policy by a foreign power! To this end, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht has devised a series of special operations to defeat the Americans and win the war: they only need your approval, mein Führer"\n\nSpeer looks at the ceiling, deep in thought. The honor of the Reich demands retribution for this humiliation, but the costs may be more than what Germany can afford now... It's impossible to satisfy all parties involved, but the best choice clearly is to..."

One day, the Reich will have an army to match the Prussian golden age and the invasion of Poland! Sadly, even one of these reforms would take months, if not years to enact... As he waits for the secretary to announce his presence to the Führer, he can't help feeling pathetic. All his preaching about Prussian discipline, honor, need for reforms, and now... oh God, the mere thought makes him want to puke.\n\n"The Führer awaits you, Feldmarschall" the secretary's voice awakens von Tresckow from his thoughts, and he enters the adorned office. "Welcome, Feldmarschall" comes Speer's voice, to which he immediately salutes. "I heard you have a proposal to improve the war effort: please, by all means, enlighten me"\n"Mein Führer" he begins, then his mouth goes dry, sweat coating his face and dampening his uniform. Then, in a strangled voice, he explains: "We need to increase our troops' efficiency, and we need to do it quickly. For this reason, I advise sending stimulants to our troops"\n\n"Oh" was Speer's only reply. Clearly, he didn't expect the principled Prussian to come up with such a plan.

What was different, however, was that the loading operations were heavily surveilled by Heer soldiers: their uniforms were so different, so pristine, and they looked more like bureaucrats than rugged soldiers.\n\nThe garrison commander had talked to the officer leading the operations. Apparently, they now needed to protect the loading operations, but when they asked why the Wehrmacht was guarding shipping procedures usually carried out by privates and mercenaries, all they were answered was that it was "sensitive informations".\n\nNow, they were looking through a list of cargoes, checking the ones already loaded.

A welcome subordinate, especially in times as dark as now, the war against South Africa souring everything for Germany. He gestured to the Generalfeldmarschall to sit down with him.\n\n"Thank you, Generalfeldmarschall, for coming here," Speer said, "I understand you can help me find a solution for the war."\n\n"Yes, my Führer, I'm glad to help you. I'm eager to help you get this under control. This is an opportunity which will surely keep us out of too much trouble."\n\n"An opportunity for the military, von Tresckow?" Speer asked, an eyebrow raised at him.\n\n"Yes. We must impress the Heer, my Führer," he replied. "If we do this, we can keep them in line. They're getting restless because of this war. And I don't want them to break ranks and become a problem. I don't want their officers to sow discord, to make us look bad. Showing off our might on the battlefields of Africa and energizing the people so that they would support us even as we remove ourselves from the war would all be great for us in the end. And if we can do this, I can keep working with Speidel to continue our reforms."\n\n"You want to create a diversion? By intensifying the war?" Speer said, trying to understand what he meant by using this "opportunity."\n\n"Yes. This will keep the more troubling elements of our ranks from interfering or sabotaging our plans, and it will also give us better chances at withdrawing from the war. And above all, it would keep Schörner happy," the Prussian said, releasing a sharp but disgusted chuckle at mentioning the bastard from Munich. He continued, "In simpler terms, if we present a strong front, we can commit to our withdrawal without too many worries."\n\n"I see." Speer thought about it, letting von Tresckow look at him and wait. In time, the Führer looked up and told him, "Go on, Generalfeldmarschall.""

Preparations and canvassing for crews, cast, and settings were done. And plans for great shows and special effects were rolling through the minds of daring producers and scriptwriters.\n\nSuch efforts were being accomplished in record time all over Germany.

In those few months, he had seen what truly was the Wehrmacht: a massive den of corruption, where nepotism, incompetence and division ran rampant. The Truppenführer's favorites never stood guard and got nicer meals, while he had to cover for their turns or risk being accused of dereliction of duty.\n\nAlongside him, four others of his unit had volunteered, attracted by the steep rise in pay. Fedor, one of the former commander's cronies, had been killed by the Amerikaner when he had forgotten to put on his camouflage; the best part, however, had been when Johann, another one high on the list, had tried to convince the new officer to let him off a patrol citing "friends in high places". The officer had pointed the gun at his head, and asked for the names of his friends, then sent him to military prison for attempted corruption and dereliction of duty, and the list of names to Germania.\n\nThe weather was terrible, so humid his uniform was always damp, and so hot that it would still be damp even if it hadn't been so humid.

On the negative side, however, the political landscape is quickly heating up: rallies both in favor and against withdrawal will be held in the next few days, and newspapers fuel the debate by siding with the reformists or the conservative hardliners.\n\n in order to put an end to the growing political tensions, the Führer has decided to hold a speech at Nuremberg. There, he'll explain to the nation why he had to take such a choice, and what will this new course mean for Germany and the larger Reich.

That way, they would be safely out of the hands of the advancing OFN. \n\nThe only price he had to pay for getting everything he could out of harm's way was the loss of territory and influence over Africa to the Americans and their allies. Now, they would be the ones to replace them, out there in the dark heart of Africa. \n\nEven if they do fail to achieve victory against the Fatherland's colonies in that continent, he told himself, we would at least rid ourselves off a sinking ship. The rising costs, the infighting among the governments of the three Reichskommmisariats against one another, and the growing strength of the OFN, all these were just too much for Germany to carry on her own.\n\nHe sighed, forcing himself to review the reports one last time before he closed them up and set them back into the basket.

After the ravages of the civil war, brought upon us by the corrupt kleptocrats that crowded Adolf Hitler's deathbed, came the unjust invasion of Deutsch-Afrika by the Americans: they took advantage of our momentary weakness to usurp our place in Africa!" he interrupted his speech for the scheduled popular outrage.\n\n"However, we managed to save as many good Germans as possible, because that's what a government does: it protects its people!

It began in the University of Vienna, and spread from there in an almost sporadic-like fashion. Newsreels couldn't resist the opportunity to show footage of thousands flooding the streets, running headlines about punks and students holding down confrontations with police cars.\n\nGoing down to the street view, further reports showed that there was a common message with the protestors.

Police have suspected that this phrase had connotations in Mainz and other cities nearby, and has spread rapidly throughout the entirety of Germany.

There were too little officers prepared to deal with entire streets packed with people chanting for the war to end abruptly, and those that attempted to calm them were only met with furious rebuttals and, in some rare cases, violent reprisals. Sometimes, people would pass by and picket the Volkshalle, and while they were quickly moved out, it was to the point when the government would be utterly blind to not notice how public opinion has soured.\n\nIt had even come to the point where Albert Speer began taking different routes to the Reichskanzlei and the Volkshalle, in order to not be stopped by protestors and deal with their anger and frustration, and many officials in the NSDAP began travelling more covertly in order to not be harassed likewise."

 speer.555.d:0 "With the Reich tumbling headlong into chaos, the silence from Crimea has grown increasingly deafening. The home of Germany's Black Sea fleet and with enough naval infrastructure to construct a small steel island, the bustling port has seen a huge amount of attention, with rumors of daily arrivals of 'gifts' flooding the Governors stately home on Greuthungistraße. However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways. \n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

Heinrich Himmler, the peacemaker." Speer and Schmidt shared a polite chuckle. "You think it can be done, though? They hate us,  no matter how cleverly we put it."\n\n"If I cannot do it, nobody can." Helmut said without a hint of irony, focusing more on lighting a new cigarette than on his Führer. Albert appreciated the confidence, even if he shared an inkling of doubt about the man behind it. "Truly though, I believe it possible. Leave it with me, let me pull a few strings in Bordeaux and see who bites."\n\nSpeer gained an almost wistful look on his face. "France back in the Pakt of its own volition would surely be something to see." His gaze hardened. "I have my doubts. Do not be hasty, I want to see a fully fleshed out plan." \n\n"Of course.

As long as we keep the talks secret until something favourable comes out of them, they'll talk."\n\n"And you will conduct these negotiations yourself?"\n\n"With your blessing, of course.

This job certainly had its benefits, even if he did work with unsavoury characters in dangerous situations. The peculiar backswept wing of the plane made his view of the midnight Earth below all the more expansive. It seemed as though he could see half the lights of Europe - but only half. \n\nThe journey to France had become much longer since France had moved further away. The expansion of Burgundy like a great tumour was perhaps one of the worst side-effects of the Bürgerkrieg, one felt by the French more than anyone. Whilst Himmler's realm remained nominally part of the Reich, that was a lie believed by no-one. From his perch above the world he could see the boundary, a stark line between patches of light and utter blackness. \n\nWhilst he could not undo what had been done, he could try and make something better. That was a mantra that he had to hold in his head more and more every day. The trouble would be in whether the French would ever believe that. The plane began its slow fall to Bordeaux."

As the plane rolled to a stop and he exited onto the tarmac of the Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport however, his pity for the French people was interrupted by the appearance of one. \n\n[FRA.GetLeader] interrupted Schmidt in French before he could say a word. "You didn't expect me yet, I know. But I will not waste my time here without knowing this meeting will come to some good - if the people found out you were here at all I would be politically crucified. Germany must renounce Burgundy in every sense of the word. Every occupied piece of France will be recognised for what it is, and German claims must be abandoned over all. The world must know Burgundy for the rogue state it is." \n\nHe took a breath, his mouth running faster than his lungs could follow in his passion.

He had been quietly pleased when Schmidt had chosen to use French rather than German in their meeting. His very presence presented a great opportunity, both for his country and for him, and he was not one to waste it with grandstanding and machismo. Neither, it appeared, was Schmidt. \n\n"Of course, for a full rapprochement we must be treated with as equals. German treaties have strangled France for too long. Our armed forces must be free, that we might at least hold the line against Himmler's dogs if he ever decides to come for what is left. We will not be some tributary state to your Reich."\n\nHelmut very diplomatically did not mention that Himmler had no concern for the dregs of France that were left.

Hitler and his cronies shunned sensible policy for ideology, and our government intends to rectify his mistakes." \n\n"I have seen the work of your Herr Erhard, and it is most impressive.

Schmidt had never seen the manual of arms performed with such machinelike precision by what he was told were fresh recruits. \n\n"You see our preparations are well underway, Monsieur Schmidt. France has had its fill of being Europe's whipping boy - when the next war with Burgundy comes, we will be ready." He was wilfully ignoring the litany of treaty violations he was revealing. \n\nSchmidt responded in French himself - when you're selling to someone it's smart to speak their language. "Most impressive indeed. It is good to see France's élan yet remains." \n\n"You are an excellent flatterer, Monsieur, but it will get you nowhere. France has demands no honeyed words can fulfill. Burgundy is a threat to both our nations, one that as much as the French dislike the idea, they must work with Germany to destroy.

Schmidt felt an uncanny sense of unease as they paraded between across the eyelines of the blank-faced troops. Despite their vacant expressions, he could feel their concentrated glares as though he were an ant pinned beneath a magnifying glass. \n\n"France's crème de la crème," Sidos remarked, enjoying watching Schmidt attempt to suppress the involuntary instinct to sweat. "Every one of them French born, French trained, and French armed. We have learned from our mistakes, and will not rely on any nation but ourselves." \n\nSchmidt had been wondering when to bring up this topic, but it seemed Sidos was forging ahead himself.

Despite the inordinate number of people filling the streets, half the shops were  closed, their doorways instead filled with vagrants. As they reached a lull in their conversation, they passed by an overturned bin, in which a street urchin was scavenging - Helmut had thoughts such sights to be confined to the realm of Charles Dickens this far west. He felt a lump in his stomach.\n\n"You see the scars that Germany has wrought upon our country," Antoine finally said, affixing his gaze to Schmidt's.\n\n"Tragic indeed, but Himmler acts of his own accord. We have renounced him, you demanded as much." As much as Schmidt hated to say it, he was here as a diplomat.\n\n"You will find no man in France who sees this distinction. The SS is a German organisation, is it not? Was it not created with the approval of Hitler? Was it not he who granted Himmler the heartland of France, who armed him, whose death led to deaths of thousands?

His plans are impressive, I must admit, but I have my reservations. France has been bound to the hip with the Reich once before, and the results were catastrophic - this is half the reason Himmler was so able to overcome us." \n\n"The economic fumbling of Hitler's days is long over," Schmidt assured him.

He expressed his regrets he couldn't be here himself." \n\n"I bet he's losing his mind. No buildings, just endless complaints." At that Schmidt gave a slight smile. \n\n"You are lucky I am president, for I doubt others would give Germany the time of day.

It is about time the spirit of cooperation overtook the continent, and swept away that of war. Of course, France's interests must be considered." \n\n"This is why I am here," Schmidt reassured, grateful that Bichelonne had left at least some of the job of selling the project to him.\n\n"For France to be truly integrated into the Zollverein, it requires some reconstruction. The war took its toll on our industry, but with Germany's help it can be restored to what it once was.

After the initial introductions Henri had seemed humble, almost embarrassed at the charade, but the idea was still bouncing about Schmidt's brain that he was the first German diplomat to converse with a French king since Napoleon III's defeat at Sedan.\n\n"It is a unique situation we find ourselves in. While I am not one to speculate, I imagine it is about as easy to get France to side with Germany as it is to persuade the French to restore a king." Henri's joke prompted a polite chuckle from Schmidt. \n\n"We live in interesting times." \n\n"Interesting indeed. I am no fool to reject your offer out of hand, but a king must do what is best for his people.

Oh. "Your former working residence was the Taras Shevchenko University, which was demolished in accidental-" Pah. Accidental. "-artillery fire during the Second World War. However, the University is undergoing a massive reconstruction project that will be authentic to the original, and we will need employees for when it opens." His gaze narrowed. "We wish to reemploy you at the university. For just a tidy salary of..."\n\nHis eyes widened. That much?! He could feed his entire family with that money! "... though, we'll make it clear that some of your co-workers shall be of German background. We hope that you do not discriminate." Viktor felt disgust rise in his throat, but the offer was so tempting. Perhaps, he'd admit to himself, constantly being at home could get boring. And he always enjoyed teaching mathematics, interacting with the children, drawing out various formulas both simple and meticulous on the green board. The longer he thought about it, the more he felt accepting the letter."

speer_ukraine.3.t:0 "Reminisce The Warriors"
speer_ukraine.3.desc:0 "As always, there was a man who came up to the stand before the Führer did, announcing his many roles and ending as the leader of the Greater Germanic Reich. Then, he retired, letting  Albert Speer himself take the podium and begin speaking. Even with his advanced age, the sharpness of his tongue did not decline.\n\n"This speech shall address both the Führer's people and the people of Ukraine. For so long, you have fought valiantly for us. For so long, blood has been spilled into the Dnieper river for the sake of maintaining the integrity of the Ukrainian state and its loyalty to the Reich. We cannot let that go unrewarded. Today, with the restoration of the rightful government, the Ukrainian people can now move forward!" Cheers and whistles were met in response, and Speer took a moment to nod before continuing.\n\n"To the brave fighters of Ukraine, I dedicate this speech to you. We shall honor the men who died for Ukraine, who died for the Reich, who died serving a cause greater than themselves. I dedicate this speech to my people, for knowing that the Ukrainians are loyal allies, for realizing this potential and bringing them into the Reich's protecting wing. Now, I shall speak about the fallen. To the German citizen and the Ukrainian patriot, I hope all will listen as I speak of their deeds..."

speer_ukraine.4.t:0 "A Taste Of War"
speer_ukraine.4.desc:0 "With the binoculars in his hand, Henning von Tresckow, Generalfeldmarschen of the Reich, peered through the window of a hastily-constructed bunker made at his command. For the past twenty-four hours, he could see his troops moving back and forth, setting up defensive positions and sometimes scouting up ahead for enemy movements. It was tense on the Ukrainian front, that was for certain. At any point, Tresckow was prepared to receive the message that war was to be declared, and, in his mind, perhaps he was expecting such a thing to happen. Freedom fighters tended to be irrationally stubborn in their ways, after all, but who knows what would happen."
speer_ukraine.4.a:0 "Perhaps war will be avoided in the end?"

speer_ukraine.5.t:0 "Roses To Kiew"
speer_ukraine.5.desc:0 "Leonhard Weidenmann pressed his hands against his coat uncomfortably as he passed with his fellow entourage of diplomats within the narrow streets of Kiew. He always felt like somebody was watching him. Perhaps the Ukrainian civilians eyeing his group warily, or the soldiers who actively proclaimed it their duty to fight for the sake of a free Ukraine, unshackled by Germany. He snorted to himself. What freedom? Freedom to flounder and die without their help? He felt a sense of superiority when he made his way through the desolate outskirts, and the inner city could still not match the beauty of Germania.\n\nHe would see to it that they return. Even when the city's rebellious nature made him uncomfortable, and he wasn't sure just what sort of people he would have to go up against - Ukraine would be part of the Reich once more."

speer_ukraine.6.desc:0 "Tresckow breathed in, then out, then set down his binoculars. Taking a seat on the nearby chair, he grimaced as he rubbed his forehead. "So you are telling me that the diplomats have been denied?" He asked, and for a short while the radio crackled softly with silence. Then a small burst came, and a young man's voice was transmitted through it. "Yes, Generalfeldmarschen, Kiew has forced our diplomats to leave, and have denied any further contact with us." For a while, Tresckow was silent, letting his mind comb over the possibilities. "... Then it is war."\n\n"Yes, Generalfeldmarschen. I believe so."\n\nLeonhard Weidenmann did not expect himself to be rebuffed so easily, but here he was, travelling back to Germania with only shame and disappointment to follow him. The talks didn't last very long. All of it was "no", "never", sprinkled in with the occasional insult about Germany. It was an insulting show with nothing to come out of it - a massive waste of time, talking with fools who couldn't understand why they needed Germany. Not only that, but on the way home, he had received grave news that only confirmed his thoughts about what was going to happen.\n\nThey were massing troops at the border."
speer_ukraine.6.a:0 "The pot boils."

speer_ukraine.7.t:0 "There Is A Certain Man..."
speer_ukraine.7.desc:0 "Albert Speer's time was at a premium - he was always busy, all the time, and when he wasn't busy, he was thinking about the ways he could get busy. A personal phone call was an inefficient use of his time - clearly, however, Pieter von Heerema thought differently, asking the Führer to confirm for himself. So he found himself at a secure telephone line, waiting for the Dutchman to pick up the phone. "Eh ... hallo? Dit is Pieter von Heerema aan het woord. Wie is dit?"\n\nSpeer bit his tongue for a moment before speaking. Of course it wasn't German. "This is the Führer Albert Speer speaking." He could almost hear the jovial industrialist on the other side light up with emotions. "Oh, ja, good! Now, I-I don't wish to waste too much of your time, but I assume you are calling me to confirm that the, ah... transaction has been fulfilled? Our friend Tys is getting anxious in Kiew, you know."\n\nSpeer sighed, tempted to drop the call there. He had already known all he needed - but he relented. "Yes, they've been sent, and we've begun coordinating a diplomatic mission with Romania in order to commit to a future territorial swap. That is all you needed, correct?" It took no time for Pieter to respond. "Yes- oh, my Führer, I've always had a keen interest in investing into Kiew, you know? Ever since Generalplan O-"\n\n"I'm glad. Goodbye." Before he could respond, Speer calmly put the phone down and let the line go dead. Taking in a deep breath, he ran a hand down his face as he turned to go back to his office."

Watching Ukraine wither under the iron heel of the Reichskommissariats, and seeing Kyiv slowly wither and collapse as the years went on filled him with a rage that was never quelled.\n\nIt should have been quiet that day, but gunshots ripped through the city. He had heard, while setting up a barricade, that these weren't the Germans - no, these were fellow Ukrainian countrymen who had decided that slavery was better than freedom. Apparently, they had made a demand for the rebels to stand down, and for the collaborationist government to be restored. They had promised reforms and safety for those who had cooperated. He had heard that story before many times - all from his father, all ending the same way. What did Ukraine get out of it? When they plundered Kyiv and took his family away, where was the promised reward of loyalty?"

Always a waste of resources and manpower, resulting in razed lands and bombed cities. What was the point of it? If it was ever worth it to fight your overlord, then you were better off striking when the iron was hot, and not conduct bloody, open warfare. Not that he planned to do that, after all - there was a state to run, and he would help run it. All he needed was to sign a few documents, and he would be the head of a new Ukraine.\n\n"Herr..." His was a thickly accented German. "Wiedenmann?" The diplomat nodded, wielding a thick sheet of papers in his hand. "Now that the rebels have fallen, the government is going to be in a bit of chaos..."\n\nLeonhard Wiedenmann waved his hand dismissively, holding out the papers for Tys to take. "Nonsense. If we've teached the Ukrainians anything, it is the art of bureaucracy. Just make sure to read these over well and sign them all personally. When you're done, well... congratulations are in order, I suppose. You will be the new Head of State."\n\nTys gave the diplomat a nod, and took the papers with due haste. "That will be all, then, Herr Weidenmann. You are free to go." With a sly smile, the German diplomat turned to leave the room, leaving Tys all alone, staring up at the flag that was draped across the top of his office. Some would call this a continuation of the German heel pressing down on the Ukrainian neck."

#Speer Japan events#
 speerjapan.1.t:0 "An Unwanted Holiday"
 speerjapan.1.desc:0 "The world was not concerned with the wishes of Helmut Schmidt. It was concerned with the Führer's. When the foreign minister had entered the main office of the Reich Chancellory, he knew what the tickets resting on Speer's desk meant. He had objected (and as politely as he could, it must be added) to a focus on Japanese reconciliation. Germania's focus should be elsewhere; anywhere but Tokyo. Schmidt had reiterated his concerns to the Führer, hoping that the old man might see the light, but with the same oh-so-friendly smile that Schmidt had come to hate, Speer placed the tickets in his hands and ushered him out the door. \n\nNow, he stood in Tokyo, those vile white banners with their embalmed blood-red suns taunting him as he left the airport. Hitler's Germany had been abysmal, and Speer's regime had proved only superficially better, but at least both had the humility of a nominal republic. Schmidt gazed out the window at the corrupt symbols of the Japanese nation, an Empire built on the rape of China and the Pacific."
 speerjapan.1.a:0 "For the good of Germany."

 speerjapan.2.t:0 "The "Glory" From Within"
 speerjapan.2.desc:0 ""Our men stand with absolute loyalty to the Führer and the national ideal," Helmut Schmidt said in forced pleasantry to the Japanese men opposite him. One of the younger gentlemen was furiously scribbling on a notepad, looking up at the foreign minister regularly with an expression of wonder and intrigue. "The Wehrmacht is the ultimate disciplined oppositional force to the American threat." \n\nAnd it was the ultimate disciplined force. Schmidt had been only eighteen when he joined the Wehrmacht and had seen firsthand the suffering and carnage it caused. Russian men had been slaughtered before his eyes, innocents and soldiers alike crushed under the heel of Hitler's eastward march. Here he was, however, praising its glories. What kind of monster was he, celebrating the military-industrial complex which had brought Germany's neighbours death and sorrow, before creating the near national suicide of the Civil War. \n\n"How you describe the Wehrmacht would greatly interest the Prime Minister and perhaps our Emperor. I think this meeting has borne some great fruit for future cooperation between our nations." Schmidt sighed. He had succeeded."
 speerjapan.2.a:0 "Victory is such sweet sorrow."

 speerjapan.3.t:0 "The Threat From Without"
 speerjapan.3.desc:0 ""Consider this President. He seems stable now, no?" Schmidt offered to his Japanese interlocutors. "At any moment, however, he can be replaced by a man of completely opposite character. Every eight years, this is certain, but he receives a challenge midway through his term, and his powers risk restraint every two years from that Congress of theirs. Your Empire would do better with a certain partner. Our Führer, like your Emperor, is guaranteed for an entire lifetime." \n\nSchmidt wishes that Speer wasn't. He longed for America's instability. He longed for her progress, made in short jumps, not centurial designs. His career might suffer, yes, but what was a career for the chance of liberation? Certainly, he would prefer honest poverty to his present hypocritical privileges. \n\nThe argument, however, hit home for the Japanese. Schmidt's suited counterparts nodded in agreement with every line, in almost unwavering agreement with the German line."
 speerjapan.3.a:0 "Maybe our old wounds will soon heal."

 speerjapan.4.t:0 "The Blue Scare"
 speerjapan.4.desc:0 "Speer wondered sometimes if Hitler's ghost still roamed the Chancellory's halls. The old Führer still certainly haunted Speer's plans. That fool had the gall for a near assassination, and by the Kempeitai of all people, meaning Germany's population is still suspicious, if not outright hostile, to the idea of Japanese alignment. No matter. A good counternarrative wasn't something the Führer was unused to crafting. \n\nThe Deputy Führer was called into the office and a plan was hatched. Kiesinger's friends in the conservative wing of the Party would be contacted, with warnings of America's capitalist degeneracy infecting the Germany they have worked so hard to perfect. In contrast, the Japanese, our traditional allies in the Axis powers, are icons of tradition, stability and hegemony. Conservative newspapers and radio networks would broadcast this line of thinking, and the country would be brought in line with the Führer's vision. \n\nWashington's favour will falter, but the greatest nations are rarely allied without the blood of another. A sacrifice worthy to sway the German population."
 speerjapan.4.a:0 "Fear never fails."

 speerjapan.5.t:0 "History Rewritten"
 speerjapan.5.desc:0 "Anti-Japanese sentiment in Germany has cooled, but not disappeared. However, anti-Americanism has quickly supplanted its role in the national conscience. In a controversial interview, the Führer told a conservative talk show host that new evidence gathered by the RND suggested that the Kempeitai had nothing to do with Hitler's assassination, and in fact, it had been a CIA operation all along. Polling data today shows that the German pubic's favour for Japan has superseded that of its favour for the United States. A shift in perspective has begun."
 speerjapan.5.a:0 "A job done well."

 speerjapan.6.t:0 "Our Domestic Issues"
 speerjapan.6.desc:0 "Having Japan as our ally again would do more than assist the German economy. It is no secret that our financial and industrial complexes have been historically turbulent, and even with Erhard's best efforts, the heart of Germany's production beats slower than it did in its youth. Trade and liberalisation bring great boons, however. Japanese firms, the Zaibatsu and others, have indicated keenness to invest in the Reich, particularly the Ruhr and our other industrial heartlands. This stimulant, Erhard tells us, will give German companies the push they need to increase their staff sizes and reduce our national unemployment issues. \n\nMoney isn't free, however. The Japanese would like to reach an agreement regarding their side of the contract, wherein we ease our protectionist policies and lift tariffs on their companies. The conservatives of the Reich may not be pleased with this, but it seems like the only choice. The Japanese certainly make it appear as such."
 speerjapan.6.a:0 "For the good of us both, we must break down our walls."

 speerjapan.7.t:0 "Our Call to the Globe"
 speerjapan.7.desc:0 "Japan brings with it possible augmentations to the German machine that will make us a fearsome presence on the world stage. Since our alliance broke apart, our nations have developed technology in isolation, and Japanese science has advanced in ways our Wehrmacht must take full advantage of. Beyond just shared mechanical advances and joint drills, the Japanese alliance brings with it unprecedented geopolitical advantage. With an ally dominating Asia, our spheres would form a co-defensive shield, allowing us to spread our influence without a knife in the back, from them or anyone else. \n\nThere is a, well, peculiar addendum to these benefits. Japan has requested that Germany assist with their 'policing actions', a series of activities Germania has been granted suspiciously little details on."
 speerjapan.7.a:0 "Something wicked this way comes."

 speerjapan.8.t:0 "A Crack in the Facade"
 speerjapan.8.desc:0 "In diplomacy, time is a commodity that must not be wasted. Given the seeming imperative nature of tariff removal in order for economic agreements to be discussed, Schmidt has requested that these negotiations begin effective immediately. However, as Schmidt hangs up the line to Germania, he cannot help but feel that there is more to Germany's new friends in Tokyo than meets the eye. \n\nHe sits in his hotel room with a cigar, pondering. Was it the way they spoke and dress? The over-politeness that made him suspicious? Surely not, as since he was a boy Schmidt had heard of the properness and honour of the Japanese culture. It did not seem out of place. Was it their insistence? But what were they insistent on? Tariff removal, something even old Erhard preached the merits of. It was odd though, the way they pushed it, at every meeting emphasising these economic agreements. He could not shake the feeling that Germany was running headfirst into a trap. \n\nIt was late, however, and the foreign minister crushed his cigar in the ashtray. These were thoughts for tomorrow morning."
 speerjapan.8.a:0 "Beware the Japanese bearing gifts."

 speerjapan.9.t:0 "Japan's Offer"
 speerjapan.9.desc:0 "Had Bismarck been in rooms like this? Had Von Metternich? Was Schmidt following in their footsteps as he approached the Japanese delegation across from him? Daily life in Germania had been exciting, to begin with, but the rotation between the Volkshalle and the Chancellory had become far more mundane than Schmidt had ever thought foreign affairs could be. In these moments, though, he felt that he was acting not as just himself, but as the whole legacy of German geopolitics. In the skies above, those mythical heroes of Germany's ambassadorial tradition, Schmidt liked to think, were looking over him. A blind spot had emerged, however. The daydreams of the Reich's foreign minister were shattering slowly as he, and his delegation, realised that they had been conned. \n\nIn many ways, it was too late. The negotiations had already started, and the Japanese were pressing for the removal of their tariffs. This would, according to the Reich's economist at the delegation, mean Germany would be economically dependent on Japan for almost five years. The holiday to Tokyo, it seemed, had been a little less than a free lunch. \n\nGermany's delegation considered its options. The deal, as it was, could be accepted. Diplomatic relations improve, things remain cordial, and we all return home to Germania after a nice holiday in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Or, we could try and bargain down the tariff removal and perhaps reduce Japan's proposed scheduling as well. Not only would Germany maintain her economic dependence, but Schmidt might just about maintain his life when he next sees Erhard."

 speerjapan.10.t:0 "Better Than Nothing..."

The Empire's offer would have to be accepted. \n\nThe Reich would remove all tariffs on Japanese imports for the next five years. The delegation's consensus, behind closed doors, seemed to be that Germany was on its way to economic vassaldom. For half a decade, the cheaper goods of the East would likely flood and monopolise Europe's market. Schmidt felt that, when he left, it would be with his tail between his legs. However, better he leave a negotiation with an outcome than run from a diplomatic breakdown and ruin all the progress the two nations had made already. What was it the Iberians say?"

This choice, to sell in a market where there's no supply but ample demand, will make your companies very rich. Too rich, perhaps. Think of your Zaibatsus. Does your state need more challenge, more corporate power from a new generation of monopolistic plutocrats? Gentlemen, I encourage you to think beyond the money. We must temper your plan for tariff reduction, and maintain protection for your sake. All the gold in Germania is not worth sacrificing the integrity of your state." \n\nMurmurs spread through the opposing delegation.

 speerjapan.15.desc:0 "You would think that the only negotiations on the table were for tariffs. Indeed, the Japanese would have loved for that to be the only subject up for discussion. However, Schmidt had come with an agenda. Germany's next proposal was to be presented, and the Reich's foreign minister was hopeful. \n\nGermany needed investment, and with its Frankensteinish economy still barely putting itself back together, growth was a necessity. Particularly, large corporations had vacuumed up much of the market and monopoly had become the norm for the Reich. Schmidt wanted to request for Japanese investment into the economy, with special focus on the smaller businesses that needed to be jump-started into success and expand Germany's middle class. Improving employment was also a major issue for the new Germany, and a large part of the solution was diversifying the range of employers."
 speerjapan.15.a:0 "How hard could this be?"

 speerjapan.16.t:0 "A Dissapointing Offer"
 speerjapan.16.desc:0 "Japan holds steadfast. The first deal from the Empire is investment, but only in the form of shares of some major German corporations. Not only will this have little effects on Schmidt's hopeful goals of reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth, but will also buy Tokyo influence in Germany's economy with no gain for the Reich. Needless to say, Germania's foreign minister is remarkably disappointed. \n\nSchmidt sees himself with two options. Either Germany accepts this imperfect deal, or keeps pushing for larger concessions, risking Japan's favour."
 speerjapan.16.a:0 "We'll this... lackluster offer."
 speerjapan.16.b:0 "Push for a deal that will actually benefit us significantly."

 speerjapan.17.t:0 "Better Safe than Sorry"
 speerjapan.17.desc:0 "Schmidt sighs, stabbing his cigar into the ashtray. "We will accept your deal." The suited rows of Japanese men in front of the German delegation can barely contain their relief. This arrangement is imperfect, yes, but it is a step in the right direction. \n\nDelegation consensus on the German end finished with an acceptance that the Reich's best interest was to accept the Japanese deal. At the end of the day, some investment is better than none, and Germany's economy is in dire need of all the assistance it can get. Schmidt, and without doubt Erhard, are unhappy with the deal, but pushing the patience of our diplomatic partners is the last result Germania wants from these talks."

If Japan sends more of it's good investors to Germany, not only will Japanese investors make more money, but your Empire will reap the taxable benefits of this prosperity, and our firms will be encouraged to issue more stock. It is an exponential cycle, gentlemen, and both our great nations stand to benefit." \n\nMurmurs across the table end with the nod of the leader of Japan's delegation.

A far more agreeable Japanese delegation than Schmidt had anticipated seemed to move forward, at least in spirit, as a group, listening to Schmidt intently. Schmidt suddenly felt the weight one does when they're the sole focal point of attention in the room. With an undetectable gulp and disguised tension, the foreign minister continued. \n\n"The logical choice, my friends, is to invest in the promising industry of German infrastructure. According to our reports, perfected by the great economists of the Reich under the internationally renowned Ludwig Erhard, the industry is due for a cyclical boom period; very, very soon. With the expansion of more firms across the country, your investments will reap even further profit and have access to a wider market of potential suitors. With these new investments into infrastructure, more firms in the general economy will be established, not just in this specific industry. An efficient road and rail system across the Reich will inevitably lead to a reduction of transport costs, incentivising business creation, and thus the production of new investment partners for the Reich and the Empire." The foreign minister, feeling especially Bismarckian, paused for effect. "Gentlemen, it is basic economics." \n\nNods and mutters of agreement bubbled on the Japanese side. Schmidt, at this point, figured himself well able to read the Japanese crowd. He knew what this meant. Another victory. The German foreign minister smiled, pleased with himself, and knowing that his nation would similarly be pleased. The once magnificent Autobahns and railways of the Reich would now have the funds to be reborn in a shape and condition worthy of the country they span."

 speerjapan.21.t:0 "We've Invested Enough"
 speerjapan.21.desc:0 "Look. What we have agreed upon already is a great accomplishment. I strongly believe, however, that further Japanese investment into the Reich's infrastructure would be even more beneficial to both of our nations. Any risk you may perceive in such investments, I assure you, only exists in the immediate term as we continue our ongoing recovery efforts from the internal conflict. As the Reich continues to regain its footing and reclaim its spot as the world's foremost economy, any hint of doubt regarding our situation will rapidly fade away. And, of course, such great economic collaboration now is guaranteed to foster strong economic ties between our nations in the future and improve the Empire of Japan's image in the eyes of the German people... and investors." \n\nNo response. Damn it! He just had to push it that much further, didn't he? Why couldn't he keep his stupid mouth shut? \n"With all due respect, Foreign Minister Schmidt, relations between our countries are still new, and we do not exactly have investors clamoring to enter the German market given the current circumstances," replied the head of the Japanese delegation. "Were you not satisfied with our already generous offer? We will have to discuss and perhaps even reconsider our previous proposal. My apologies, Foreign Minister"
 speerjapan.21.a:0 "Oh, I'm sure you're very sorry."

 speerjapan.22.t:0 "The Geopolitical Chessboard"
 speerjapan.22.desc:0 "On to the next phase of negotiations. The next topic was easily the second-most important one to Schmidt after rejuvenating the economy for the sake of the German working class: combating imperialism. Or, as the topic was titled at the negotiating table, "non-involvement".\nSurely, as the upcoming round of discussions began, the Japanese would ask Schmidt to provide guarantees that Germany would not get itself involved in internal (or maybe even external) Co-Prosperity Sphere affairs. These were not promises Schmidt wished to make, as he strongly opposed Japan's violent hegemony over Asia, but depending on how many demands he could wriggle the Reich out of, it would maybe be possible for such promises to secretly be empty ones; Germany might be able to assist, for example, the rebels fighting for freedom in Indonesia.\nSchmidt chewed on the fine line he would have to walk if he wanted to seem amicable to Japan's interests while also trying to help the world become a slightly less brutal and evil place."
 speerjapan.22.a:0 "Something no one in power seems to want."

 speerjapan.23.t:0 "Shipping Inspections"
 speerjapan.23.desc:0 "Foreign Minister, there is actually one more issue we wish to discuss. As you are no doubt aware, Japan is currently dealing with certain... rebellious elements in Indonesia. We have reason to believe that there may be certain foreign influence in Japan's internal affairs, and we would like certain assurances from Germany that you are, erm, doing everything in your power to prevent aid from reaching these traitors. We ask that all German ships travelling through Co-Prosperity Sphere waters be submitted to cargo checks prior to entry. Understand that this is essential to the Sphere's internal security, Herr Schmidt." \nSchmidt replied, "Searching every single vessel to pass through the Sphere's territorial waters could greatly hurt our profit margins and slow down our shipping... Of course, I understand why you ask this of us." \nSchmidt was not happy with any agreement that would hurt Germany's economic recovery, and therefore its working class. The Japanese delegation knew this, of course. What they did not know about was Schmidt's sympathies towards the Indonesian freedom fighters who, while not necessarily seeing eye-to-eye with Schmidt on every issue, at least had the guts to actually stand up and openly fight facism. But was this worth souring relations with Japan yet again? Germany desperately needed economic partners."
 speerjapan.23.a:0 "We're in no position to argue."
 speerjapan.23.b:0 "But we are in a position to lie..."

 speerjapan.24.t:0 "An Acceptable Concession"
 speerjapan.24.desc:0 "There wasn't any point in ruining Japanese relations over a few cargo checks. They would be a hindrance to Germany's recovery, but not nearly as much of a hindrance as a lack of foreign investment. \n"Very well. You have yourselves a deal. The Reich will allow all shipping to pass through Sphere waters to have its cargo examined in exchange for your valuable investments," stated Schmidt to the Japanese delegation. \nThe pleasantly surprised look on the faces of the Japanese delegation implied they had expected at least a bit of negotiating. Abandoning any chance of helping the Indonesian rebels escape Japan's fascist grip left an uneasy feeling in Schmidt's stomach, but he figured that this show of goodwill towards the Japanese now would at least pay off for Germany later."
 speerjapan.24.a:0 "Let us hope that it does."

 speerjapan.25.t:0 "An Unexpected Concession"
 speerjapan.25.desc:0 "Schmidt simply could not allow a deal which would impede Germany's path to economic recovery, but he also couldn't risk pushing away the Japanese altogether. Why not, then, attempt a compromise? \n"It would be very difficult for Germany to make sufficient profits on exports to the Co-Prosperity Sphere if a bottleneck is created in your shipping lanes. But we do acknowledge your internal security concerns. How about we make official inspections of all cargo ships before they leave Germany to ensure that no materials are being smuggled in order to undermine Japanese sovereignty? We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments." \nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. And it seemed to make sense to the Japanese as well. Resignedly, the head of their delegation responded, "Yes, that would be an acceptable compromise. But of course we insist we receive all of your inspection reports so we know exactly what is entering our waters." \n"That will be no problem at all," replied Schmidt jovially, knowing this would be enough for him to at least somewhat help the Indonesian rebels in their fight against Japan. He supposed it was the small victories that really counted."
 speerjapan.25.a:0 "We've pushed the envelope enough."

But it seemed to be quite unsatisfactory to the Japanese delegation. Stiffly, the head of the delegation responded, "No. We must insist upon inspections of German cargo. We cannot utterly compromise our national security for the sake of speeding up your shipping! I am afraid that if you cannot agree to this, we will be forced to reconsider our previous agreements." \nWhoops. Now the Japanese would likely inspect German ships with a great deal of suspicion and care. Schmidt felt his face redden with embarrassment and frustration as he forced himself to accept Japan's initial demand. There would be a sizable economic price for Germany, and possibly the ultimate price for the Indonesian rebels who were now out of reach."

 speerjapan.27.t:0 "Pushing To The Limit"
 speerjapan.27.desc:0 ""This is never going to work." Schmidt muttered, an unlit cigarette forgotten in his hand. Speer held his own cigarette in his mouth, occasionally letting out a puff of smoke. The two men watched each other warily before Schmidt continued. "My Fuhrer, to ask the Japanese to let us check our own ships for arms is one thing, but to ask to help with cutting off the American boats too? They'll never do it."\n\n "I believe it's worth the risk, Helmut. I mean, if there's one thing we have in common with them, we don't like the Americans much." Speer responded calmly. "Besides, some ammo and weapons always go, ah, missing on patrol, if you catch my gist." Schmidt scoffed and pulled out his lighter.\n\n "If all of my work falls through because of this. . ." Schmidt grunted as a secretary entered, holding a new report. Both men watched silently as he placed down the letter, embossed with the official seal of the Japanese Embassy. Slowly, Speer opened it and skimmed the paper, settling onto one sentence. He placed the paper down and looked at Schmidt, a grin crossing his face.\n\n "They're in.""
 speerjapan.27.a:0 "We can all learn to work together."

 speerjapan.28.t:0 "Pushing It Too Far"
 speerjapan.28.desc:0 ""God damn it, Albert!" Schmidt shouted, his eyes lasers of fury boring into Speer's skull. "You've gone and fucked it all up!"\n\nSpeer, for his part, held his own bravely against Schmidt's assault. "Helmut, I pushed for the best deal we could get, and it didn't work out. Not everything does. It was always a risk, you know."\n\n "It wasn't a risk, it was diplomatic suicide! Since when has Germany offered to send PT boats to Indonesia just to "cut off the Americans"? Of course they'd see through that! I don't understand it, my Fuhrer, I really don't." Schmidt sighed. "I had a deal and everything, too. One that wasn't too bad for our interests, or at least didn't ruin our relations."\n\nSpeer shrugged. "Again, we gambled and we lost. That's diplomacy."\n\nSchmidt excused himself before he said anything that would lose him his job."
 speerjapan.28.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 speerjapan.29.t:0 "The Next Stage"
 speerjapan.29.desc:0 "The office of the Japanese Ambassador was significantly cleaner than the Fuhrer's. Tasteful artwork lined the walls, and the desk sat organized and clean- a departure from the chaos of Speer's room. Schmidt sat across from the Ambassador, hands in his lap. "It's quite simple, really. Our two nations both hold technologies that the other would like to know. Relations, of course, have been historically. . .strained, and as such, our technological cooperation has been all but non-existent. I propose that we should rectify this oversight, for the benefit of both our nations."\n\nThe ambassador regarded Schmidt calmly, tapping his hand on his table. "I see." He began. "But what sort of technology would we be sharing?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "Depends on what we agree to." The ambassador continued to watch Schmidt closely, the two men looking for any betrayal of either's ulterior motives. After a moment, the man stood.\n\n"Technological sharing would certainly be a boon for us both. I like the idea, Schmidt." He said. Schmidt smiled- it was a good start."
 speerjapan.29.a:0 "To work, then."

 speerjapan.30.t:0 "Opening Moves"
 speerjapan.30.desc:0 "The shutters of the Ambassador's windows were closed today, giving the room a sense of privacy. Schmidt took his seat gently as the Japanese ambassador watched him, the fluorescent lights in the roof giving off a bright glow. The ambassador began. "So, Schmidt, what is the Reich interested in obtaining from Japan?"\n\nSchmidt cleared his throat. "The Kriegsmarine and the Heer have both expressed interest in some of Japan's advancements. Navally, it is no contest- the IJN clearly outpaces our underwater capabilities. On the ground, I believe we are about even, but some areas are certainly more advanced in Tokyo than in Germania. Hell, there may even be some parts of your air doctrine we could use. In short, the Heer asks for some of your military advancements, and we are more than willing to pay for them."\n\nThe ambassador pondered for a moment before replying. "I would hope so, Schmidt, but I do not believe the IJA or IJN are as willing to hand over their secrets as I am. However, I've been reassured that neither branch has an issue with sharing some of our RADAR and communication techs. Would this be an acceptable compromise to you?"\n\nNow it was Schmidt's turn to go through the options. "I take it this is not a take it or leave it offer?"\n\nThe ambassador smiled. "Depends on what you say next. I'm sure I can do some convincing, if needed.""
 speerjapan.30.a:0 "Yes, we can do that."
 speerjapan.30.b:0 "Allow me to retort, if you will..."

 speerjapan.31.t:0 "The Easy Solution"
 speerjapan.31.desc:0 "Schmidt read Speer's letter with a mixture of annoyance and resignation. It was everything he had expected it to be- perfunctory, disappointed, and with the barest hint of congratulations smeared over it. Of course Speer would be disappointed- he never had to actually talk to the Japanese. He just got to sit back and reap the rewards.\n\nOf course Schmidt could have pushed harder. The ambassador had left it open. The issue was, of course, that trying to push it was risky. If Schmidt had gambled and lost, would Speer say "Oh, that's ok. You tried your best."? No, of course not. He'd be just as disappointed as he was now. He clearly didn't understand, thought Schmidt as he sat down in his chair, just how tough it is to negotiate a detente with a power that you've been actively threatening for decades. Sure, they didn't get everything they wanted. That's how compromise works. They got something, and they get the detente that was so important. I'd call that a win myself, Schmidt thinks.\n\nHe sighed as he grabbed his lighter and a smoke. Speer never seemed to understand the finer details of international diplomacy. In the end, Speer was only an architect, not a diplomat. Maybe he'd never understand the finer points of negotiation.\n\nSometimes, Schmidt really hated having to work for him."
 speerjapan.31.a:0 "Good enough."

 speerjapan.32.t:0 "In Deep"
 speerjapan.32.desc:0 ""Well." Schmidt began, eyeing the Ambassador's watchful gaze.

I believe that we can certainly do more with each other than just that."\n\nThe ambassador tilted his head. "What do you suggest?" Schmidt's eye's shifted around the room as he thought.\n\n "Attaches, perhaps, to aid our military. Plane technology- those bombers of yours have quite a range, perhaps that would be a useful tool for our Luftwaffe. Hell, maybe even some naval technology, like gun computation or navigation, or perhaps anti-air capabilities."\n\nThe ambassador stiffened in his chair. "And what do you propose to give us?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?"\n\nThe ambassador thought for a moment, and an uncomfortable silence entered the room. Schmidt did his best to hide the rising tide of worry inside of him. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the ambassador responded. "I believe that is a workable compromise.""

"I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?" \nAn uncomfortable silence entered the room. Everyone stared at the head of the delegation, awaiting his response. "We cannot accept this deal. I can see that Germany is enthusiastic to share technology and cooperate with Japan, and Japan does indeed feel the same way. But I predict this is simply beyond what our armed forces are willing to accept, and we have no desire to push them to do so." \nThat was unfortunate. Though for Schmidt, the issue was not the failure to develop Germany and Japan's militaries, but merely relaying this failure to Speer who would no doubt be angry. Ultimately, it wouldn't really matter too much, Schmidt supposed."
 speerjapan.33.a:0 "Ah well."

 speerjapan.34.desc:0 "Schmidt hung up the phone angrily. He hated negotiating for things which would only bring more harm to the world.

If they ended up at war with a power strong enough for Germany to need such a large navy, it would probably be the end of the world anyway. Sighing, Schmidt left his hotel and returned for another day of diplomatic negotiations. \n"Good day to you all. While we recently came to an agreement on an exchange of military support for some of your technology, Germany would actually be interested in taking this deal further. We understand that Japan has made major strides in naval technology, and Germany is very interested in the fruits of these advancements. We are prepared to offer you a substantial sum for it... in cash." \nEyebrows raised, the members of the Japanese delegation pondered and privately discussed Schmidt's offer for a moment before coming to a decision. "Seeing as we won't be fighting you in the foreseeable future, we see no reason not to sell you our advanced naval technology. Now then, shall we begin negotiating the price?" asked the head of the delegation, who made little effort to hide his greed.

While we would not exactly refer to this request as a trap, it seems that Germany's sharp and quick-witted foreign minister senses our... ulterior motives. \nThere is a great degree of logic to opening diplomatic relations with the Germans, but why shouldn't we get as much out of it as possible? We'll offer to remove tariffs on each other's goods for five years, which will yield us a great amount of influence over the German economy during that period. If you want global power and influence, you're going to have to twist some arms. Let the German delegation come and negotiate with us tomorrow, and we will see just how much Japan stands to gain from their desperation."

This choice, to sell in a market where there's no supply but ample demand, will make your companies very rich. Too rich, perhaps. Think of your Zaibatsus. Does your state need more challenge, more corporate power from a new generation of monopolistic plutocrats? Gentlemen, I encourage you to think beyond the money. We must temper your plan for tariff reduction, and maintain protection for your sake. All the gold in Germania is not worth sacrificing the integrity of your state."\nWell then, it seems he had thoroughly thought things through before the day's negotiations. Any mention of the Zaibatsus challenging Japanese state power was already enough to turn many heads among our delegation. While it was more than certain that Schmidt was trying to maximize the potential negative consequences of our proposal because he didn't like it, his point remained valid and hung in the air stubbornly.\nThe head of our delegation had the opportunity of holding firm on our existing offer or accepting Schmidt's counteroffer of shortening the lifting of tariffs to three years with the Germans showing no preferable treatment to the Japanese market. It would not be as beneficial for Japan, but perhaps there was some sense in trying to smooth relations with Germany..."

I think we can do better."\nThe foreign minister had to know he was getting closer and closer to a line he should not cross, but he must have been willing to do whatever it took to secure the best possible outcome for Germany. In the name of cooperation and friendship, maybe we could concede to him a little more?"

Our countries will not be brought together, and neither of our economies will be benefited, unless we are to make a decisive treaty here. If Japan sends more of it's good investors to Germany, not only will Japanese investors make more money, but your Empire will reap the taxable benefits of this prosperity, and our firms will be encouraged to issue more stock. It is an exponential cycle, gentlemen, and both our great nations stand to benefit."\nMurmurs consumed our delegation all across the table. There was certainly opportunity to be had in increasing Japanese investments in the German economy: more profits, more influence, and improved diplomatic relations with the Germans for a start.

After the generous investment package that we had already offered, the German foreign minister asks Japan for more?

Still, that he would so boldly try to slip Germany out of these shipping inspections was a grave insult to the Japanese delegation. How could he understand the troublesome position the Japanese Empire was in? Actually, if he knew how bad things were in Indonesia, he might even gain the upper hand in the negotiations. We would be weak to back up on our initial demands now, but it is not out of the question if we really want to show the Germans our desire to work with them."

With our naval support, you can cover much more ground and more efficiently patrol for enemy supply ships." \nWas this some kind of sick joke? There was no way that the Germans were making this offer from the goodness of their hearts. Was there? Why on Earth would they offer their resources to protect Japanese waters? This was most likely a ploy to undermine Japan's security, and perhaps even to sneak through support to the Indonesian rebels themselves. The Japanese delegates sat silently, masking their rage and shock at hearing such a blatant diplomatic slap in the face. They did realize that Japan could in fact use the help that was being placed directly in front of them, but did they dare to assume that the Germans' audacious proposal was at all legitimate?"

"I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?"\nAn uncomfortable silence entered the room. The other members of the delegation looked to their leader in anticipation. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the response:"
 speerjapan.46.a:0 "I believe that is a workable compromise."
 speerjapan.46.b:0 "We cannot accept this deal."

 speerjapan.47.t:0 "An Even Juicier Offer"
 speerjapan.47.desc:0 "Another day of negotiations, another day of the Germans pushing us even further and asking us to more extensive agreements. What would it be this time?"Good day to you all. While we recently came to an agreement on an exchange of military support for some of your technology, Germany would actually be interested in taking this deal further. We understand that Japan has made major strides in naval technology, and Germany is very interested in the fruits of these advancements. We are prepared to offer you a substantial sum for it... in cash." \nWell then... that was a bit of a surprise. The IJN was very protective of their modern technology, but depending on how much the Germans offered... Eyebrows raised, the members of the Japanese delegation pondered and privately discussed Schmidt's offer for a moment before coming to a decision. Would Japan really turn down this opportunity for cash and co-operation?"
 speerjapan.47.a:0 "It's not like we'll be fighting each other. Let's start negotiating a price!"
 speerjapan.47.b:0 "You're being a little overzealous, don't you think?"

 speerjapan.48.t:0 "An Acceptable Agreement"
 speerjapan.48.desc:0 "The collapse of Hitler's regime came from its ambition. With victory in Europe, the Reich did not content itself simply to the boundaries of the Memel and the Meuse. It overstretched. It wanted Russia, France, Africa and the British Isles all under its banner. In punishment for wanting everything, Germany was stripped to nothing. \n\nSchmidt would not make the same mistake Hitler did. Even a softening of Japan's deal became a worthy price to pay for detente and friendship with the Reich's old accomplice. Economic dependence was something that could be justified in return for security, trade, technological development and all the other merits that allies bring. Schmidt would not push further than the Japanese had allowed him to. A good diplomat is one of moderation."

 speerjapan.49.desc:0 ""Thank you Foreign Minister Schmidt. Our investments in the German economy do indeed seem like they will bear much fruit for both of our nations in the near future. That will be all for today, and the end of economic negotiations between us, then," said the head of the Japanese delegation. He certainly appeared to be much less stiff than at the beginning of the conference, and could now even have been described as ever so slightly friendly. \n"Indeed. Have a lovely remainder of your evening, and we will continue tomorrow," replied Schmidt with a casual smile on his face. \nHe had done it! He had secured what was, to him, the most important thing for the German people: an actual source of stimulus for the economy! Schmidt had realized there had been no need to push the Japanese on even more investment when he'd already successfully pushed them to increase the size of their investment package. He couldn't have risked the livelihoods of the workers and families of Germany on trying to net more than he had even bargained for. \nUpon informing Speer of the sealed deal, the Führer even had to reply, "Well done, Schmidt." If even Speer was satisfied with his work, then Schmidt knew he had done more than well enough."
 speerjapan.49.a:0 "A tangible victory for Germany."

 speerjapan.50.t:0 "A Crummy Compromise"
 speerjapan.50.desc:0 "Schmidt's ashtray was getting full quickly. Making tough decisions that had impacted tens of millions of people was rather taxing on the mind. He had decided it was best to avoid provoking the Japanese delegation anymore after they had already agreed to allow Germany to check its own shipping before being sent to the Sphere. It would still slow down trade and hurt German profits, but it beat having ships being stopped for cargo checks in Japanese waters- that would have been a much worse bottleneck. \nEverything Schmidt did was in the name of improving the lives of the German people. If he had to make some concessions that would in the long run provide him more opportunities to help, then he would do it. Besides, the negotiations with the Japanese were far from over."
 speerjapan.50.a:0 "Atleast it's more than they initially offered."

 speerjapan.51.t:0 "Quit While You're "Ahead""
 speerjapan.51.desc:0 "Oh, how wonderful! Schmidt succeeded in negotiating a significant technology-sharing agreement with the Japanese. He didn't bother asking for any more than what had already been agreed upon, both because he didn't want to overreach and destroy the chance of any deal being signed, and because he didn't think he could stomach helping his or any country to make war more than he already had. \nThere was, however, no more time for Schmidt to ponder the morality of his actions. More negotiations with Japan would continue tomorrow, and maybe then he would get the chance to do something that would help instead of hurt the world."
 speerjapan.51.a:0 "I'm trying my best."


 speerjapan.52.t:0 "Adding a Spark to the Fire"
 speerjapan.52.desc:0 "Schmidt's heart throbbed and his muscles tensed as if he was on the verge of being caught red-handed. But that was impossible. As far as anyone knew, he was merely signing some mundane document allowing some trade to leave Germany for the Co-Prosperity Sphere, he told himself. There was no Kempeitai agent watching over his shoulder as he wrote his signature on the paper authorizing the secret weapons shipments and beginning of RND operations in support of the Indonesian rebels fighting the Japanese Empire.\nOnce he had finished signing the document and submitted it, Schmidt felt both incredibly relieved but somehow still awfully tense. He knew he was doing the right thing. Any help he could give to those who were bravely fighting against Japan's fascist hegemony over Asia was something to be proud of.\nSadly, Japan was enforcing a strict system of inspecting all German shipping entering the Sphere's waters, but sneaking a few small ships through with arms and RND agents was still doable. Who knew, maybe even this small degree of assistance would be enough to turn the tide in the Indonesians' favour and forever alter the course of history."

There was no shipping bottleneck and no need to stow away weapons hidden beneath ordinary goods. Surely the assistance that Schmidt had helped to organize would help reverse the tide of Japan and its hegemony, and finally push the world onto a better course."

Such a degree of foreign assistance was almost certain to bring victory to the cause of Indonesian freedom, and to shift the global tide against ruthless hegemonic powers such as Japan.\nAt this point it almost seemed like Schmidt was able to help everyone in the world attain freedom except his own people."

This was exactly why Schmidt had suggested to Speer and the RND that only a few small, isolated black sites were set up across Indochina so that there was no way the Japanese would ever find them.\nSchmidt scanned the document nervously and let out a large sigh of relief. All of the planned sites had been smoothly created after the RND agents had secretly landed on various desolate beaches across the vast jungles of the region. Due to the caution that had been employed, they were disconnected and poorly supplied, but this was much better than nothing.\nNow he had to sit back and wait as the reports on the RND's activity gradually came in over the coming months.

Why bother with the damn report if it's not even going to be read? "Allowing Japanese goods and investment into our economy would be generally beneficial to Germany if we sign a trade deal with Japan.

Televisions, portable radios, home phones, coffeemakers, power tools, electric mixers, blenders, modern stovetops, microwave ovens, electric toothbrushes, digital alarm clocks, hairdryers, polaroid cameras, electric razors, air conditioning units, washer-dryers, vacuum cleaners, and all sorts of other goods can now be found in practically every middle-class German household.\nAll of these brand new products have caused Germany's consumers to come out and buy everything they can.

I'm just calling on behalf of the American executive branch to relay certain concerns we have."\n"Please, go right ahead." The American ambassador to Germany cleared his throat.\n\n"It's impossible not to notice that Germany has also begun trading with the Japanese Empire. Though the US and Germany have now become economic partners, we are incredibly wary of any cooperation with Japan. We'd simply like you to reaffirm that you're not forgoing any of our pre-existing agreements and that you're not giving any special or preferable treatment to the Japanese."\n\n"Oh, is that what this is about? You can tell my friends in the White House they have absolutely nothing to worry about. Our new administration is simply opening the Reich up again to all sorts of foreign partnership opportunities. The Germany of isolation and conquest is no more, and that's all there is to it, Ambassador." Schmidt felt genuine pride in being able to say that Germany was truly on a path of change.\n\n"I figured, but I wanted to hear it from the horse's mouth so I could relay that to my superiors, so thank you for that. Have a nice evening, Foreign Minister.""

 speerjapan.62.t:0 "Down to Buisness"
 speerjapan.62.desc:0 "Our efforts to approach the Japanese with a trade agreement have proven fruitful, ending the embargo between the German Reich and Japanese Empire has alot of potential to aid the development of our economy.\n\nHowever, we still need to iron out the specific tariffs we shall levy on Japanese imports. On one hand, lower tariffs mean that we will see less benefit from trading, however, lower tariffs mean more Japanese goods will compete with established German firms which could be destabilizing to the market."
 speerjapan.62.a:0 "Get Erhard on the Line."

 speerjapan.63.t:0 "Tarrifs on Commodities"
 speerjapan.63.desc:0 "First comes the matter of consumer goods. Reducing tariffs would lower the price of exotic Japanese goods and allow more Germans to purchase them. Being able to use their incomes on more than Fanta will no doubt make many happier with our regime allowing us to recieve more political support from the citizenry of the Reich.\n\nHowever, the Reich's economy has just begun to recover, many newly established firms are in a vulnerable position as they struggle to make a profit. Lowering tariffs too much might mean that many newly established German companies might not be able to compete with the low prices of the massive Japanese corproations, causing many to go bankrupt. Many companies haing to fire their employees has the potential to be destabilizing, especially considering the short amount of time that would pass between many people being hired and fired."

 speerjapan.65.desc:0 "Lastly, we must decide on how harsh our tariffs should be on Japanese technology. The Reich's academic base has been in a state of decline for the past decade, a lack of consumer industry and a bloated military industrial complex has meant that most of our research has been used on developing new weapons for the Heer. Trading technology with Japan could allow us to study it and improve our own consumer focused innovation.\n\nHowever, as with industrial goods, we run the risk of growing overly reliant on Japan's technology which would allow them to have a greater sway over our regime."

erhardnomics.1.t:0 "Kartellgesetz"
erhardnomics.1.d:0 "Cigar smoke wafted strongly in the room as Ludwig Erhardt flicked open a lighter to continue the trend of making it just a bit more difficult to breathe in the room. In front of the man with a plan sat, reading over a document, the Führer himself - Albert Speer. He had been holding a hand to the side of his head, occasionally stopping up to gaze at a certain piece of text before either sighing or rubbing his forehead and continuing. "Herr Erhard," the old Führer began, looking up at the Minister who seemed to look just a little bit happier when they met eye-to-eye. "This law of yours... the Kartellgesetz. How do you propose we push this through? After all, the most affected would be the four biggest companies in Germania. And...", "And what, my Führer?" Erhard calmly shot back, puffing the cigar and pulling it out of his mouth. "What would they do about it? Complain? Certainly, they would," Erhard stopped up, blowing out some smoke and taking another puff, "but consider this. They would practically be admitting to keeping each other in business in a big charade. And that..."\n\nA small grin approached his lips. "That wouldn't reflect so well on the 'Aryan' spirit, now would it?" He said, almost seeming to be mocking the notion of such a thing. Speer glared at him as if Erhard just gutted an animal in front of him, but eventually took a deep breath, and then an even deeper sigh. "If you would be so kind as to listen," he strained, subconsciously pressing a thumb down on the document, "I can tell you that they have tools at their disposal. Allies. Influence. If we begin with something like this, then we run the risk of..."\n\nErhard chuckled, shutting the Führer up quickly. Throwing the used-up cigar out into a nearby trash bin, he simply crossed his arms and shook his head. "Hostility? Yes, but this is the easiest way to begin approaching them. If you don't want the Reich to be dominated by giant corporations that effectively run the state for you, my Führer, then I suggest that you take my suggestion, or I'm afraid that my ideas end here." Speer wanted to say something. Something that could turn the case against Erhard, but there was nothing. If he hadn't had a medical check-up recently, he swore he could've felt an aneurysm coming. "And believe me, my Führer, I have a lot more than just the dismantlement of cartels in mind."\n\nThe old minister's gaze sharpened, and Speer felt like he could read exactly what the man had in mind."
erhardnomics.1.a:0 "What have I gotten myself into..."

erhardnomics.2.t:0 "The Reich's Needs"
erhardnomics.2.d:0 ""My Führer..." Erhard began, splaying his fingers out across the map of Europe, pointer finger placed on the heart of the Reich. "I understand that you have some incessant need to plunder the countries you control, but all that would lead into is a slow deterioration of relationships with the other Zollverein members." He looked up towards Speer, and saw the glint in his eyes. This wasn't good.\n\n"Herr Erhard, you should understand the main principle of this union between countries. It has never-" Erhard felt like he wanted to put a rip on the paper right where the capital was- "A benevolent, equal partnership." Speer put both of his hands on the table and looked down, then splayed one over the territories beyond the Reich. "These are territories we have conquered all fair and well in a war that we started. If there is anyone to be determining who gets what, it shall be us." The minister licked his lips. He could've gone for a drink right about now. "Is that really it, my Führer? Just a sentimental want to..." There was no way Speer could have believed in only that, could he? "... My Führer, I hope you have a very good reason to stick to this tenant of National Socialism. The only road this can take is down."\n\nSpeer took his hands off the table and clasped them behind him. "I don't know what you want to hear out of me, Herr Erhard, regarding this issue. I believe there never was an issue to begin with. The members of the Zollverein may not be happy about it, but they have nowhere else to turn to. In the end, they can only return to the Reich." Erhard swallowed, taking concentrated breaths. "What is it that you want me to do now, then, my Führer?" He asked, nearly failing to conceal the anger in his voice. "Isn't it obvious?" He rhetorically asked. "I want you to alert Herr Kiesinger that the Reich's policy remains the same.""

erhardnomics.3.d:0 "The smoke that came into his view while staring through his binoculars confused him for a second before he realized that, no, Warsaw wasn't burning, that was just the cigar in his mouth. Still, he was surprised that Speer rounded up enough political capital to get this many men out and this much equipment. Perhaps it was simply the sheer obviousness of his arguments? Erhard chuckled softly when he remembered how Speer tried to argue against reinvesting into Warsaw and Kyiv. Something vague about the Reich expressing strength by showing the Poles and Ukrainians that resistance was meaningless, but even then Erhard could have seen that he wasn't really believing the argument himself.\n\nNo - what was more likely was that Speer was a snake who thought that he could give a minimal damn about making the Reich seem to be more than just the crushing iron grip of Europa that needed to be removed. He was no National Socialist, certainly, but he could see sense to reason. Or perhaps he did, but was too afraid of the clutches of democracy? Erhard found that both funny and frustrating, but before he could continue looking at the construction project mobilizing men and equipment, he felt a shake on his shoulder.\n\n"Herr Erhard," the voice said, and it took him a moment to process that it was actually the project manager. Lowering his binoculars and turning his head, he raised an eyebrow. "Yes?", "If I may ask, why Warsaw and Kyiv?" It didn't take him long to respond as he shook his head. "Besides being potential industrial heartlands? Well, I suppose there's another reason for it. These are some of the most hardest hit areas of Generalplan Ost, and starting here could perhaps earn us the goodwill of the non-Germans living in these areas." He could feel the cold gaze of the manager on him, only tamed by the fact that he was much higher up than the man. "Well?" Erhard started up again, returning his own glare. "Are you staring at me? Zoning out, perhaps?" He continued, voice filling with irritation and sarcasm. The manager gave him no response, seemingly confused and worried by Erhard's words. "So? You're not? Out with it, then! Is it something you wish to say? Or do you perhaps have nothing to tell me?" He could see the manager visibly swallow. "Then go! You have a project to be overseeing, don't you? Oversee it!"\n\nIt took Erhard a solid minute to calm down after he left. What was he even thinking, starting dialogue with a man like that?"

But now they were here, Erhard drinking a small glass with strong alcohol while Schmidt was more modest, deciding on some wine instead. With a pleasant sigh, the minister of the economy spoke. "The resignation trick works every time. Really, I wasn't expecting him to be so asinine about it. It's like I was asking him to instate elections." Schmidt let out a short laugh. "No, God no, if it was like that I think he'd ask you to resign instead." Erhard himself chuckled, and would have reached for a cigar had that not been allowed in the restaurant.\n\n"I suppose, however, that you can tell me more details about this plan of yours?" Schmidt asked, prompting Erhard to sober up a little and listen to what the Foreign Minister had to say. "Yes," Erhard began, nodding. "It's quite simple, it's just that the plan will take a long time to implement. I'm aiming for Germany's colonies to industrialize sufficiently, you see." Schmidt nodded. "If we want them to stand as partners, they can't be so reliant on the old home that any economic crises would make them buckle and crack, just as it happened in the fifties. Instead, you're going to, with my help, turn all of those colonies into shining, rich jewels. Not on par with Germany itself, but at least enough to be a little self sufficient."\n\nSchmidt nodded again - this time more clearly satisfied. A smile graced his lips as he spoke. "But what of the consequences? What if they demand independence?", "We'll give it to them," Erhard stated flatly. "Eventually. If Speer isn't a fool, he'll let us build the base to feasibly stop exploiting them. If he is a fool, however..." Erhard sighed."

If we do that, all we're setting ourselves up for is a future failure of our sphere." His words stung cruelly, and Speer relented on uttering a swear before turning to look to Helmut Schmidt. "And you?" Speer asked, voice tightened somewhat. Schmidt nodded politely, then showed a hand towards Erhard. "He's right, my Führer. If we decide not to liberalize the Zollverein, then we'd be running the risk of eventually turning the members turning against us. Just look at Japan and its sphere as an example. The tensions between the members and Japan are palpable."\n\nWas Speer really hearing this? Now two out of the four members of the Gang were nearly directly coercing him into following through with their demands. And if he decided to raise a voice? Protest? Then only the obvious would have followed. Letting the air in the room stay thin for a few seconds more, he finally decided to speak. "Erhard." He stated, turning his gaze to the man. "Let's say we do liberalize the Zollverein. In the future, what's to stop them from dreaming about detaching themselves from the Reich? To pursue a light at the end of the tunnel? After all, if we are so benevolent now, then the implication would be that we can continue this benevolence for the future. And this... would not bode well for the Reich."\n\nErhard's eyes narrowed, and his teeth grazed against the skin of the cigar just a little bit harder. Taking it out his mouth, he sighed. "My Führer, you have it backwards. I understand that you hold a more traditionalist position on this, but it doesn't mean that everyone that isn't Ge-- the Reich, is unreasonable. But for exactly the reason you initially described is why they would not leave us." Speer leaned back, stare softening only slightly. "After all, what do they gain out of leaving a mutually-beneficial partnership? Pride?" Erhard shook his head. "They already lost that a while ago. They would have only to gain by staying, and nothing by losing. This," he paused, taking a puff of his cigar, "Would only happen if you let this reform pass." An air of silence passed between them for many seconds. Both men in front of the Führer wondered what he planned on staying-- before he pushed his chair back and stood up. The expression on his face spoke a thousand words."

A company that serves as a true testament to Abs' profit-driven motives, and the costs that come with it.\n\nIG Farben is a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate. On a surface level, it is nothing more than a megacorporation, pulling its strings across all of the Reich, its colonies, and further abroad than that. Under the helm of Hermann Josef Abs, it has risen to become one of the most powerful actors within the government, not only having wide scale influence in large parts of the Unity-Pakt, but fielding their own private mercenary company, as well as a heavy, if not total, reliance on brutal slave labor. Having reaped the rewards of a victorious Reich, Abs has certified his reputation of what it is to be successful as a German. Out and active, he has crafted a carefully-made image of an apolitical yet loyal businessman, serving the interests of the Reich.\n\nYet under the guise of an honorable and capable man lies a bloody history driven by a single desire. Hermann Josef Abs, under the wraps, is an incredibly cunning and ruthless man. It can be safely claimed that his economic empire stretches from sea to shining sea, and that his business acumen remains one of the most unrivalled in the whole world. His reach extends to every continent, and IG Farben only remains to be one of the many companies under his repertoire, with many more scattered around the world.\n\nIn the homeland, however, is where Abs makes his capital, and something can clearly be said about IG Farben and its shadow ruler - it is a threat. A threat not only politically and economically, but morally as well. It stands as a testament of success to relying on slave labor-- an idea unworkable in the long run, yet here it stood as a shining jewel in a pile of riches. If Erhard is to collapse this rotten structure from the inside out, all his genius would be for naught if not firstly invested into the largest threat that stands before him. A titan which will force Germany to bend under a system that cannot hold forever.\n\nHermann Josef Abs is a force."

Before Fischer could reply, Wessel waved him off. "No need for the games of masquerade. I know your name. It's pointless."\n\nIt was the strangest thing. Wessel was Gehlen's point-man. Why was he here? "No disrespect meant, sir," Fischer said, his heart rate sinking by the minute, "but what are you doing here?"\n\n"I am only here on a brief visit, Herr Fischer. Simply put, I have a proposition for you. An assignment. We believe that you are the most qualified to do so."\n\n"Do tell." Fischer's voice was cold as ice.\n\n"Enthusiastic, are we? The Fuhrer is having problems with the corporations. You know which." Fischer nodded. "We offer you two choices. Infiltrate the slave camps," Wessel's fingers stilled Fischer's complaints.

The objective is simple: The facility will be struck swiftly, and it is your job to sneak into, outflank, and demoralize the mercenaries into giving up without a single shot fired. Remember!

It comes as no surprise, then, when Erhard believes that out of all the megacorps dominating Germany, Siemens stands out as the sole exception of a company that doesn't have to be fully dismantled. In fact, quite the opposite. If the minister played his cards right, he could potentially get a powerful ally on his side.\n\nBut that's not to say that they're completely innocent. Ernst von Siemens has gotten his way to the top, after all, which does not mean he relied purely on honest business practices and sheer skill. Instead, it has signed into a contract with every other factory to form cartels. Now placing themselves in a position where they can remain untouchable by anyone who isn't as wholly massive as they are, the Siemens empire prospers greatly at the top, and it isn't quite certain how they will react once Erhard begins his plans. There is only one way to find out, however, the structural integrity of the one empire that wishes to step forward into the future."

Edmund Geileber, having recently become the new Wehrwirtschaftsführer, uses the connections he has to maximize profit and safeguard the existence of his income - because of this, manuevering through Geileberg's web will prove difficult.\n\nThere is, however, a spot of hope in facing this massive slave holding company that threatens to undermine Erhard's plans. Of the four corporate giants, it is only the Reichswerke that is state-owned, which, assuming Speer's cooperation, would significantly ease the problem in delimbing the monster.

Whatever road it would go didn't matter in the moment, however, as he looked over an analysis of who owned what in the Unity-Pakt.\n\nA chuckle escaped his lips as he took a puff from his cigar. Before, entire regions of Germany and its partners would be shaded in solid colours, but now? Now only one colour dominated the battlefield, and those four megacorporations that were left were reduced to nothing but small dots and sometimes even stripes to indicate conflicted ownership. Staring at the map for a moment longer, Erhard nodded to himself. With his economics plan put into full force, he knew that the people - and, most importantly, the middle class - would thrive from this change of pace.\n\nWhen Erhard eventually left his office, he took a slight detour and made sure to pass where Speer was currently residing, just to take a look at the man's expression. With only a quick stop by the door, he could glance at the man shuffling papers, his face showing only uncertainty.

Now he could do it knowing that he wouldn't have something looming over his mind as he did. The vehicle in question was Mercedez-Benz W108 vehicle. It was a few years old at this point, and there were other choices available to him, but this car struck him out as pleasing to the eye, and, as he rode in the streets of Germania, felt the quality of its build on the concrete streets. These cars weren't built with trembling slave hands. Instead the design was constructed by a healthy, paid German, one who specifically studied and prepared for that sort of job.\n\nNot only that, this car he bought did not come from some far-reaching company that employed millions upon millions of slaves. Instead, it was by a factory sold off to a middle-class family at the behest of the government. And to really drive the point home, Erhard made sure that anything built by German hands alone would be specifically marked as being such. If his plan blossomed fully, that would mean that eventually, that label would apply to every German product.\n\nStepping out of the car in the parking lot, Erhard looked over the vehicle once again. This could be sold abroad, even - fall into the hands of an American family that could appreciate German technicality repurposed for more benevolent means. He was almost certain that Speer would look at him with a worried expression if he said that out loud, but at least he would consider the proposal of exporting German goods to beyond just the Unity-Pakt\n\nWith the theorizing done with, Erhard began his service of the Reich that morning.

He is merciless, and a prime example of a Nazi brought into the modern generation. But that is not why he is so dangerous.\n\nIn Erhard's eyes, being connected to the black heart of Europe known as Ordenstaat-Burgund is already a horrific sin. Flick, however, goes above and beyond that, being a man who has direct ties to the abomination that leads the whole project - Heinrich Himmler. Not only that, but Erhard knows that he has directly supported the cause of the SS with monetary compensation. And so, in order to further the Einheitspakt of the devilish ideology known as the Burgundian System, Erhard must strike hard at Friedrich Flick and his empire."

"The tide turns strongly, doesn't it? In just a few years short, we've gone from our old Führer to something fresh and exciting." Another, Friedrich Flick, the Wehrwirtschaftsführer of Daimler-Benz, shot him a glare, but Abs merely ignored it.\n\n"Oh," Erhard began, downing a shot glass. "I agree. I like our new direction. Now, if I may call to attention why I brought you all here in the first place." All eyes landed on Erhard - from Abs, to Flick, to the silent Edmund Geilenberg and the curious Ernst von Siemens. "As you're aware, the Speer administration will be doing a multitude of things. Reforming the army, strengthening the economy, loosening up diplomacy, and maybe laxing a few laws of old here and there. That's all well and good, but my personal interests lies in the problem that's faced Germany for decades. I'm sure you all know what that is."\n\nThe air seemed to still around them. Geilenberg spoke first. "I will hazard a guess that this is about the slaves." He bluntly stated, and Erhard's smile merely grew. "Correct, my friend. All of your companies-" Abs' steady supply of smoke from his cigar stopped. "-... well, to make it easy to understand, they're going to be dismantled." The group collectively tensed up, and while Siemens was the least tense, Flick seemed like he was on the verge of rage. "I knew I shouldn't have come here!"

Speer asked, and Kiesinger found it simple to oblige.\n\n"It's a several-step plan. In no particular order, I would like to deal three issues. First, it is difficult to keep conquests held, especially if it is from people that hold contempt from us. Wouldn't you agree?" He asked, and Speer gave a wary nod. "I propose a solution. We can either reform the Reichskommissariats into natively-organized collaborationist governments, or turn them into Reichsländers. These would be a more... seperate-but-equal deal.

Millions of prisoners - untermenschen, POWs, political enemies - occupied the concentration camps, being worked to death or starved to no end beyond extermination. As Armaments Minister, Albert Speer gave them a different fate entirely: to work, day and night and unto death, in the German war machine. Rather than breaking rocks and being tortured at the whim of SS guards, they would work the forges and assemble tools of death for the Wehrmacht.\n\nIt seemed like a good idea at the time. Most men of fighting age were enlisted or conscripted to fight the plutocratic democracies of the West or the Bolshevik menace of the East. With women relegated to more appropriate roles, we were in desperate need for hands - any hands - in our factories. Without the mass employment of forced labor, we could not have produced the mountain of armaments that allowed us to crush our foes with an ease that no capitalist economy could have matched. Slave-forged tanks, guns and planes were as essential to our victory as strong German souls.\n\nHowever, slavery has grown completely out of control. No longer constrained by the state, our industrial leaders have developed a monopoly on the use of slavery, locking most of the German populace out of blue-collar jobs. Even agriculture has no room for free workers, as Prussian land magnates rent tens of thousands of slaves on the cheap from corporations like Reichswerke and IG Farben. For this plague on the Reich to end, the power of the megacorporations must be permanently broken and the deprived masses set free - no matter the cost."

As anyone knows, the approximately 40 million slaves in the Reich cannot simply be granted manumission en masse and set free. That would result in little more than social and economic chaos across Europe, along with a great deal of bloodshed.\n\nThe first and most pressing concern is of course the nationalization of slavery. As long as slaves remain private property, they remain vulnerable to excessive exploitation and the whims of uncaring industrial corporations. Placing them under the exclusive stewardship of the Reich Government will ensure that they are well protected and given more humane treatment - an important step in rehabilitating our image as a more benevolent empire.\n\nThe second step is repatriation. The overwhelming majority of slaves are Slavs, predominantly of Polish and Ukrainian origin. Thankfully, we have extensive records of the slave system and can track each and every one of them. Starting shortly after their nationalization, the slaves will begin to be organized and sent back to the countries of origin in a steady stream. Though slow at first, we expect this 'Rückführungsprogramm' to pick up speed as the freed slaves become more cooperative and see that our intentions are true."

Not for myself, my family or my friends. Two men from my unit - men who had lived through both Barbarossa and the West Russian War - committed suicide because they could find no purpose in their daily lives once the Wehrmacht no longer needed them.

He wondered if a Russian leader had found some humor in the same idea he found just now.\n\nHe eventually stood up, walked around his desk, and out of his office, absentmindedly going through the corridors of the Chancellery, thinking about the things he and his government were free to do now that those people of the likes of Schörner would finally be out of here.\n\nHe stopped by a portrait of Adolf Hitler, studying him in a more civilian attire. The Fuhrer once looked up to him, owing him for the opportunities given to him. He earned much from what Hitler did. And now he was gone.\n\nAt least now, Speer wondered, a new Germany wouldn't have to worry about the excesses which Hitler promoted. For now, Germany would be free from warmongering dogs."

speer.509.t:0 "Another Meeting with Erhard"
speer.509.d:0 ""So, Herr Erhard." Speer ground his teeth and forced himself to smile. "It's been quite some time since we last talked about policy, hasn't it? I assume this conversation will be just as... bracing."\n\nWithout a word, Erhard stowed his cigar between his teeth, reached down to his briefcase and hauled up a textbook-sized folder, presumably stuffed to the brim with proposals, spreadsheets and assorted financial documents. Speer continued smiling, but the light of false enthusiasm winked out in his eyes. "Oh," he murmured.\n\n"I'm sure Kiesinger has already given you the abridged version, my Führer," Erhard began. "Simply put: we need the Mittelstand back. Small- and medium-sized businesses were the bedrock of the German economy right up until Hitler started handing out government contracts to the Party's biggest donors. We all know how that turned out. We've put a lot of effort into building a middle class - they'll be crucial to our new policies. We have to rely on the established corporation as little as possible from now on. Don't issue them new contracts, don't engage with them, don't indulge their requests."\n\nSpeer paused for a moment. He examined Erhard, blinking against the fragrant smoke drifting between them. He swallowed. "But what if-"\n\n"No room for 'buts', my Führer. You know the stakes of this game - Abs and his lackeys won't compromise. Our plans are directly opposed to theirs and they know it."\n\nSpeer sighed. No chance to get a word in edgewise with Erhard. "We'll have to deal with them directly at some point, Erhard."\n\n"Yes, I know. I've scheduled a meeting for next week. You, me, and the four leading industrialists in the Reich. It'll be our moment of truth, my Führer. Don't be afraid to lay down the law and put those scum in their place.""
speer.509.a:0 "Don't I have a say in this?"

speer.510.t:0 ""Your Days are Numbered""
speer.510.d:0 "The conference room was thick with cigar smoke. Abs, von Siemens, Geilenburg and Flick sat around the great oaken table, idly tapping ash into provided trays and sipping their drinks of choice. "Speer's late," drawled Abs, extinguishing the nub of his cigar and producing another from a gold-plated case.\n\n"Some Führer he is," muttered Flick as he finished his gin and tonic. "Can't even keep an appointment, and he thinks he can run the economy however he likes?" The room lit up with coarse laughter. "Makes you long for the days of Hitler. Talk your leg off, but at least you'd get what you wanted from him in the end."\n\n"Do you suppose he's serious about cutting our supply?" asked Geilenburg. "Surely he'd just be shooting himself in the foot. How does he expect the Reich to survive without us?"\n\n"It's disgraceful that he even made the suggestion," Abs quipped. "Disgraceful. Disgraceful that he'd just piss on National Socialism like that, on everything that made Germany great. I'm sure 'the people' would love to hear all about that, don't you think?"\n\nThe click of jackboots on marble entered earshot, drawing closer by the second. Nobody moved. The double doors swung open as a pair of sharply-dressed Wehrmacht guards stepped in, saluted the guests, and stepped aside. Behind them marched the Führer. By his side was Ludwig Erhard, the hated meddler. They drew to a halt before the conference table, surveying the room with cold eyes. Nobody rose to salute or greet them. Men who understood each other needed no words.\n\n"Citizens," said Speer, voice clear and with a rehearsed edge to it. "Henceforth, by Führer Directive, all involuntary laborers in the Greater German Reich are nationalized. All individual laborers, organized groups and privately-held camps are to be considered state property. You will not be compensated. That is all."\n\nThe room was silent for a moment before Abs dropped his cigar and rose to his feet. "Speer, this is-"\n\nBut he was gone, the guards slamming the doors behind him. One image would remain with Abs for weeks to come, however: that of Ludwig Erhard smirking as the destruction of his corporation was assured."

speer.513.t:0 "Apologising for Our Actions"
speer.513.d:0 "At the same time in both Germany and Italy, the Großdeutscher Rundfunk and the Telegiornale RAI gave a simultaneous broadcast on all channels. "The Führer of the Großgermanisches Reich, Albert Speer, shall now release an official statement destined to the government of the Italian Empire" came the smooth voice of the German announcer, with Italian subtitles, and after a few seconds, the camera passed to the Reichskanzlei, in the Führer's representation office: there, behind an ornate desk with an eagle-shaped golden inkwell at its center, the ink pots safely tucked under its wings, sat Speer himself. For a moment, a shadow of hesitation passed over his otherwise serious face, only to disappear as soon as his eyes focused on the camera. Then, he spoke, subtitles following his words.\n\n"Citizens of the Italian Empire, perhaps you may have forgotten, but we were allies once. Against an enemy ten times superior, we stood side by side, our bond of brotherhood tested in fire and blood, from the icy steppes of Russia to the fiery desert storms of the Sahara."\n\nA moment of pause, again a small hesitation, then his expression became one of contrition: "However, our alliance came to an end after the unwise actions of our country. My predecessor, ill-advised by corrupt members of his administration, chief among them Hermann Goering and Martin Bormann, ordered the construction of what would come to be known as the Atlantropa dam. We all know the results, and the beautiful cities of Venice, Genoa and Naples bear the scars of our mistake. As Adolf Hitler's successor, the responsibility of such shameful and irresponsible conduct, which can't be simply excused by his advanced age and his progressing illness, falls upon me, and for this, I am sorry"\n\nAnother small pause, another, longer hesitation, then he looked directly at the camera and, in a heavily accented tone, he spoke the crucial words: "Mi dispiace, perdonatemi se potete"\n\nThe camera went dark, and the anchorman's smooth voice resonated once more: "That was all. We thank you for your attention, and bid you a pleasant evening.""
speer.513.a:0 "All of the Reich asks the Italian people for forgiveness."

speer.514.t:0 "Our Southern Border"
speer.514.d:0 "If one were to travel to the border between the Großgermanisches Reich and the Italian Empire, no matter where he came from, he would immediately notice several roads departing from the main artery, even though there are no towns or villages signalled. If, taken by a sudden curiosity, he were to climb one such road, he would find his desire for knowledge abruptly ended by bright signals bearing the unmistakable "Militärischer Sicherheitsbereich. Unbefugtes Betreten verboten" or "Zona Militare. Accesso Vietato"\n\nIf one were to see such signs, he would turn his car immediately and forget about any curiosity, for unbeknownst to him, he would already be in the scope of a sniper belonging to the elite German Gebirgs Brigade or the equally elite Italian Alpini, following his every move as he leaves what is, in truth, one of the most heavily-militarized regions on Earth.\n\nWhen the Atlantropa disaster struck, the Mediterranean nations - Italy, Iberia and Turkey - left the Axis in a rage and established the Triumvirate. Immediately, the new alliance prepared to defend against what would later become the Unity-Pakt. All mountain borders, from the Balkans to the Pyrenees, were fortified, but none so much as the Alps: the frontier between the Italian Empire and what was once Austria is a single, gargantuan fortification spanning more than two hundred kilometers. Bunkers, pillboxes, trenches and sheltered walkways dot the Dolomiti, and while the icy peaks may seem pristine to the casual observer, they hide deep underground galleries and ammunition depots, and anti-aircraft positions encased onto the mountains. Like a cursed mirror reflecting the evil within the hearts of men, identical defences can be seen on the German side.\n\nIn the end, the German attack never came, as the Reich collapsed under its own weight like a clay-footed goliath, but the fortifications remained, and even now, thousands of Italians and Germans look at each other from the ramparts, the ingenuity of such fortifications only surpassed by the hate they were built with, as if the very concrete echoed the feelings of betrayal and anger of the Italian people."

speer.515.t:0 "Approaching the Swiss"
speer.515.d:0 "The embassy of the Swiss Confederation is like an island of tranquility in a storm-wracked sea. Ever since the battle of Marignano in 1515, which saw its entire army annihilated by a vengeful Republic of Venice aided by the French, Switzerland has observed a policy of strict neutrality, enshrined in 1815 after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. This, however, didn't stop the Swiss from taking interest in the rest of the world, at first by selling their soldiers to a Europe in constant war, and then by developing what is perhaps the largest banking system in the world. Respected by all, and equally distant from all, the Swiss government ensures that war stays as far as possible from its idyllic mountain paradise.\n\nAs he reads the latest reports from Schmidt, who is desperately fighting against the diplomatic equivalent of an incendiary bombing perpetrated by the Italian delegation, Albert Speer can't help sighing. Why did he agree to such onslaught? If not for the sake of working with the Gang of Four, he never would have wasted time in such an endeavor, one which will most likely end in failure. Still, he has been dragged inside this mess, and now he has to help his Minister against an enemy who wields diplomacy with the same skill their ancestors in the Italian city-states did centuries before: one third high culture and fine wines, another one charisma and sharp words, and the final third daggers and poison hidden behind a smile.\n\nPutting down the report, he reaches for the phone and enters the number. After a few seconds, an overly-eager voice answers: "Your Excellency, what an unexpected call! What can I do for you?" to which the Führer replies: "Ambassador Chenaux-Repond, I call you for that matter you mentioned to Reichsminister Schmidt last week. The Reich would be interested in expanding Swiss banking operation within Brandenburg, but in exchange, I have to ask you to act as a mediator in our current diplomatic talks with the Italian Empire" immediately comes the answer: "I will inform the Federal Council of your most generous offer at once, Your Excellency. Please wait until tomorrow" and then the call ends."

The conservatives, on the other hand, refuse to humiliate the Reich by granting the Italian Empire the upper hand, and insist for token concessions which will nonetheless please their delegation. Finally, the Führer himself is trying to act as a mediator, and could find a middle ground in substantial concessions, but nothing major.\n\nStill, the arguments from all sides are very convincing: the matter is now in the leader's hands, in what direction will the helmsman decide to steer his ship?"

speer.9999.d:0 "Speer's stomach dropped into a pit. "They can't all be gone. Why would they be?"\n\nThe secretary looked lost and more than a little afraid. "Their offices are all cleared out. Their homes, too. The Bohemian Orpo reported seeing Schmidt in Prague this morning, but nothing more. Herr Gehlen has suggested that they've fled the country after..." he cleared his throat. "After the direction your last conversation took."\n\nSpeer could barely force himself to speak. "You are dismissed," he mumbled. As the secretary left his office, the enormity of the blow struck the Führer like a hammer in the gut. The Gang of Four was no more. Just like that, they had walked away from his grand project, from the promise of a better future for the Reich. There would be no more economic reform, no more charming the NSDAP, no more keeping the Wehrmacht in line and no more hope for positive relations with the rest of the world. It didn't seem real. Surely it couldn't end like this?\n\nHis phone rang, startling him out of his fugue state. He paused for a moment before lifting the receiver to his ear and steadying his voice. "Hello?"\n\n"My Führer," came the gravelly, condescending voice of Hermann Josef Abs. "I hear you're in need of some assistance with your economic policy. If I might be so bold, myself and some particularly eminent National Socialists have a proposal for you...""

erhardgo4.1.d:0 "Smoke had long since displaced any clean air in the room, despite the cracked windows. The meeting had overshot its expected length by over an hour, and Erhard showed no signs of stopping the torrent of figures that somehow poured from his mouth while he chewed his cigar. Even those with more of a head for figures had begun to tune out - Speer's eyes glanced towards the others seated at the table. The various hangers-on were frantically flicking through papers, trying to keep up.  Kiesinger was doing his best to appear interested but Albert recognised the glassy look in his eyes. Reichsminister Schmidt was making his own way through the tome Erhard had provided, tilting his head and nodding at some paragraph incomprehensible to human eyes. The Führer redirected his attention back to the economist as he seemed to be coming to the end of some point.\n\n"...tax exceptions and exemptions abolished, tax deductions reduced drastically, and the implementation of a true fixed rate income tax."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows raised at this sentence. "You know as well as I do that our industry relies on those tax breaks, Friedrich. The Reichswerke reinvested half of what they saved on new equipment this year. How much are you proposing for this tax?" \n\nReichsminister Erhard took another drag of his cigar, worked it about his mouth and exhaled across the table. "Forty percent." \nAt that, slumped necks straightened and eyes refocused. Speer coughed, and not because of the smoke. "That's... ridiculous." he settled on, unable to think of a better word. "IG Farben alone will have my head. They've been paying less than twenty since the war." \n\nFriedrich didn't appear ruffled, just inhaled more smoke. "Ridiculous it may seem, mein Führer, but I can assure you it is quite sound. The people have been holding the burden of taxation for decades. Regressive tax policies may expand industries, but they have become bloated. Forcing the industrial conglomerates to pay what they owe while allowing the people to spend more will force a new equilibrium, one they'll appreciate far more than those fat slaving bastards at Farben did."\n\nThe Führer once again took stock of the room. Schmidt's eyes had brightened, and his nods turned from the paper to Speer. Generalfeldmarshall von Tresckow looked sceptical but kept his thoughts to himself. Deputy Führer Kiesinger leaned over to Schmidt, hoping to glean some of his knowledge."

erhardgo4.2.d:0 ""Telephone for you, mein Führer." \n\nSpeer glanced up, ready to deliver a rebuke at being interrupted mid sentence, before he realised he had been expecting this call. There were few others who could demand a conversation with the Führer in this manner. He sighed, and gestured for the phone. The ministers sat about the table looked variously confused and intrigued - save for Erhard. He simply leaned forward in his chair. \n\nSpeer held the receiver to his ear. "Speaking."\n\n"Mein Führer," the voice drawled, barely pronouncing the honorific before turning to business. "I'm sure these new tax rates haven't escaped your attention. They must be corrected at once." \n\n IG Farben may have been the biggest name on Herr Abs' business card but it would certainly be pressed for space. Close to fifty of the Reich's largest businesses boasted him on their board of directors. Few others could speak to Speer so brusquely. \n\n The Führer looked down at the tax papers that decorated the table this very moment. He wasn't remotely surprised they'd leaked, considering the magnitude of IG Farben's influence. "Hermann. You called at an ideal time." Not a hint of sarcasm showed on his face, though a hint of a smirk tugged at Erhard's lip. "We were going through the plans, and your input would be appreciated."\n\n"Then you can sweep them off your desk. You know damned well what those tax breaks do for us, and you can be sure everyone in my phone book will know they're going by the end of the day." The phone went dead. \n\nReichsminister Erhard chuckled. It seemed like he didn't need to know what Abs had said. "If I may mein Führer, I don't think it necessary to respond. The opinion of a man like him is not something you need to worry about.""

Once gathered it was just as monumental a task to sort through, but for the knowledge he gained he would pay any price. \n\nThe Führer had proved more easily moved than he had expected. Perhaps he was sincere after all - one does not ignore the richest man in the Reich on a whim. The numbers didn't lie, and while there had been a short term income drop it had been more than made up for by the sudden and vast flow of currency between the hands of the Reich's citizens. One Mark is not one Mark but many, holding value for every transaction it is used in, and taking the money out of the pockets of men like Hermann Josef Abs was a good deed in itself. They could complain, but if things kept going this way their oligopolies would be on the way out. "

The economy will bounce back, people will spend more, small business will become profitable once again! What hold does he have over you, damnit?"\n\nAlbert recalled a moment, back as Minister of Armaments and War Production. He had to fight to hold the position of course - Hitler didn't tolerate anyone who couldn't carve out their own sphere. It required ambition and ruthlessness. The first, he had known he had. The second, not so much.\n\n"I've heard excellent things, Herr Speer. Your designs for the camps have been most impressive." \n\n"Thank you, Herr Himmler. The true trouble was acquiring more workers, of course, but Sauckel has proven most resourceful. If events proceed as planned, we should see upwards of a million voluntary labourers from the east.

Kiesinger quietly took in the office until Speer gave an exasperated sigh and put down the phone with more force than was necessary. \n\n"Erhard has announced this tax plan of his to half the damned Reichstag."\n\nAs the Führer leaned back in his chair, Kurt commented "Ludwig is like a dog with a bone with these things, but this is far even for him." \n\nSpeer rubbed at his eyes. "Economists are more trouble than they're worth. The whole economy is more trouble than it's worth. Tell them it's cancelled, tell them it was a spy, I don't care, just shut him up before he does any more damage." \n\n"Albert... I'll admit I was sceptical, but this plan of his has merit. People need this kind of change, and reining him in now may be far more trouble than it's worth. And men like Abs need kicking down."Speer's mind flicked back, fifteen years perhaps? The Volkshalle dome, his magnum opus. Twenty companies selling materials. Four selling people - Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs. Abs had shares in every one of them. How many were buried in foundations?"

One of the greatest slave owners in human history? Fuck him." A scowl had built on Erhard's face, and he ground his cigar out into the ashtray. \n\nSpeer blinked. An ugly look built behind his eyes. "The hell are you talking about? I am your Führer. You do not resign without my say so. You do not do anything without my say so. You will fix this." The Führer spat the last sentence. The other around the table glanced about - it was only the inner circle now. Erhard was at the opposite end of the long table for once. Kiesinger and Schmidt sat in the centre, opposite another. They were each alternating glances between the economist and their Führer. Generalfeldmarshall von Tresckow stood by the window smoking a cigarette. \n\n"I am fixing this. I am trying to fix the mess of the past 20 years of mismanagement. And if you won't let me do that, I don't know why the hell any of us are here."\n\nKiesinger and Schmidt had both raised their heads, but it was von Tresckow who spoke first. "He's right." Henning paused, giving Speer and Erhard a chance to break their locked gaze. "You're here because people believe the Reich should be different. If you don't give them that - if they think you are just like Bormann, or Göring? You'll be swinging from a gibbet with the rest of us."\n\nThe normally turbulent atmosphere of the room calmed as each of them imagined the scene."

Even if Speer wanted to stop him going he couldn't have - and why would he? He had defied every order he had given him. Still, the man had been good at his job. Schmidt and Kiesinger had apparently retired for the day, and somehow Albert didn't think they would be far behind. He couldn't have Erhard killed, not now, and without them? He'd always been an outlier in the party. Hitler had sheltered him while he'd built his little sphere, but without him he relied on men like Tresckow to keep the army happy, or Erhard to fix this bloated mess that was his Reich. \n\nNow he was all alone.

"I thought economics didn't like the idea of minimum wages. What are you advocating them for?"\n\nErhard's voice, even through the phone, was coarse, bold and full of pomp. "We aren't unified in that position, my Führer. Indeed, I think it's probably essential to furthering our economic recovery."\n\nThe Führer began tapping one finger on his desk, a nervous tic he'd acquired from many a heated debate with Erhard. "Well... Herr Erhard, I do respect your expertise, but if you're in the minority that makes your position on this tenuous. That's to say nothing of what the industrial leaders will think of it."\n\n"The industrialists?" Speer could hear the sarcasm coming. "Oh, I'm sure, my Führer. I'm sure the industrialists - the men who've grown rich from not having to pay their workers at all - have a far more well-considered perspective on this than your hand-picked economic minister."\n\n"Spare me, Erhard," Speer sighed. "Just explain your reasoning."\n\nThe old man wasted no time. "As long as we lack a minimum wage, we face a twofold problem. First, the people won't have any confidence in the jobs being offered to them. Why go looking for work when it will barely make a difference to your income in the first place? Second, right now our economy needs to be shifting goods and that can't happen if consumers lack purchasing power. Follow through with this plan and you'll see the difference in mere weeks."\n\nSpeer's finger stopped. The logic was sound... but what would the corporations think? Surely they knew a thing or two about economics - if they opposed this so stringently, could there be some merit to their arguments? "Thank you, Herr Erhard," he replied after a few moments. "I'll consider your proposal.""

They'd have been happier if I'd declared myself a communist!"\n\nErhard waited for the Führer to quiet down and lean back in his chair. "And what about the common man, my Führer? What does he think? What about the students, or your supporters in the Reichstag?"\n\nSpeer looked mortally offended for a brief moment before gritting his teeth and responding. "The Reich doesn't operate according to the wishes of the mob. I understand the dangers that kowtowing to the corporations poses, but-"\n\n"Oh, fuck the corporations!" bellowed Erhard, shooting upright with hands planted on the table, nearly biting his cigar in two. "Do you honestly think they have the Reich's interests at heart? They've grown fat on the profits that slavery offers - our economic situation is at least fifty percent their fault exclusively! If they hadn't been given carte blanche on German industry and put in a position to back your opposition, you wouldn't have faced such stiff resistance in the first place!\n\nFor the most powerful dictator on Earth, Speer suddenly felt very small. "Don't raise your voice to..."\n\nErhard's next words cut to the bone. "Our dear friend Benito once said that to make a people great, you have to send them into battle even if you need to kick them in the pants. The same's true even for a Führer! If you know what's best for Germany and its people, you'll heed MY advice and not that of some bloated, psychopathic slave-driver. Good day, Herr Speer.""

Kiesinger's inoffensive voice cut through the fog of Speer's thoughts, prompting him to glance up. The Deputy Führer was relaxed and cheerful-looking, not to mention entirely too correct in his assessment to yell at.

"Isn't that a price worth paying? Isn't having a few angry men to put in line a lot better than having the entire working class starve because they continue to live off the state's loose change?"\n\nThe Führer felt a little less tense suddenly, but was careful not to show it.

What's happened?"\n\n"Speer's fucking killed our minimum wage legislation! Half our representatives in the Reichstag staged a walkout and the working class are out for blood! The Orpo's already fucking shot five people this morning!"\n\nKiesinger paused and chewed his lip. If the Orpo had turned violent that quickly, it meant that the Führer had ordered it. If the Führer had been that quick on the draw, it could have been part of his plan. "Dear God," he muttered. "What about Erhard? What's he doing?"\n\nSchmidt half-chuckled, half-sighed. "What do you think? He's gone to the Reich Chancellery to give Speer a piece of his mind. No, he didn't want to wait for us."\n\nKiesinger felt a bead of sweat drip down his temple and his neck start to prickle. "I'll head down there myself right away." The Deputy Führer hung up, wiped the sweat from his face, and dashed out of his kitchen to get dressed and prepare for the worst."

Speer reached out a hand slick with sweat to lift the receiver to his ear again. "Yes?"\n\n"My Führer," came the voice of his secretary. "Parteikanzler Kiesinger has confirmed it. The legislation passed this morning with Herr Erhard's approval, to, ah... to a full minute of applause, apparently."\n\nSpeer stared down at his desk, unresponsive. "My Führer?" came the tinny voice from the phone. "Are you still there?" Without responding, Speer dropped the receiver back into place and slumped back. A few different streams of thought ran through his mind. Had he definitely said no? Did he actually approve the proposal and just forget about it? Maybe Erhard was working to undermine him. How could he? Or maybe... maybe he wasn't. Maybe this was a good thing. But Erhard had disobeyed him. But maybe he was wrong? Maybe it was a blessing in disguise?\n\nIt took a long, long time and more than a few missed calls before any particular line of thinking won out and compelled Speer to pick up the phone once more."

Why the fuck else did you bring me on board?" Erhard was facing down Speer, leaning on the desk with a lit cigar smoking on the carpet at his feet. Kiesinger couldn't see his face, but he could see the Führer's - and it was ruby-red.\n\n"I'm the Führer, Ludwig, and I won't tolerate this insubordination from a fucking economist! Would you have talked to Hitler like this?" Kiesinger had never seen Speer shouting before - not even when browbeating the Bormannites in the Reichstag.\n\n"It's because of Hitler that you need my help in the first place, you arrogant shithead! He threw our economy in the gutter and you helped him do it! Why can't you confine yourself to political games and architecture instead of meddling in things you can't even begin to comprehend?" Erhard's hands, gripping the sides of Speer's desk, were so white that Kiesinger thought his knuckles might burst from their flesh.\n\nSpeer still hadn't noticed Kiesinger - nor, it seemed, Schmidt and von Tresckow, who also stood just inside the doorway looking equal parts awkward and frustrated. "If you won't even heed common sense," bellowed Erhard, "Then I suppose there's no need for me in this administration!"\n\n"Resign without my permission and I'll have you shot!" Speer blurted. The room fell silent. Erhard's shaking form went completely still. Tresckow spun on his heel and stalked out. Schmidt shook his head and left as well. Erhard, without even gathering up his trademark briefcase, slammed the desk and shoved his way past Kiesinger. Only the Führer and his deputy remained, staring at one another until the latter, too, sighed in resignation and left the office for what felt like the last time."

After Speer returned the salute and sat down with them, the Prussian rose up to speak.\n\n"My Führer, I must raise the matter of lowering the draft to one year, and I must ask that it be decided on now."\n\nSpeer blinked. Was that a demand? "I can see that, von Tresckow, but I-"\n\n"I understand, My Führer, but we can't keep pulling people into the ranks for too long. Having too many in the army will erode our professional core. We must lower the draft soon."\n\nSpeer sighed and raised his hands up to his chest in frustration. His cup was waiting for him, the steam rising from the coffee.

I just approved it," Speer replied, hoping it would discourage him.\n\n"It will be difficult, but it's a smaller price to pay than having to put up with the loss of strength in numbers!"\n\n"That is something we can make up for in the quality of our men and our officers.

They began to raise their voices, to speak up more and more as Speidel finally spoke up.\n\n"Keeping this many men in our army is going to strain the capacities of our country. It will push us to the very limits of our abilities. And keeping so much under the watch of our officers now would force them to compromise the quality of training for the sake of accommodating the excess. It will mean a disaster for us in war if we have more men than our officers could lead."\n\nTresckow also added, "The country cannot continue living with this kind of system. While it is understandable that we keep an army that stands ready for the Fatherland, it is more understandable that we keep that army at its best. We must not compromise its standards. My Führer , please consider the benefits. They are worth more than an army larger than we'd want it to be."\n\nThe Führer himself listened to them, but sighed at the end of their words, simply exasperated at their continued attempts to get him to reconsider Tresckow's request."

He enjoyed his cup of coffee which he so wanted before, just as the rest of his cabinet enjoyed their victory in seeing this pass.\n\nSchmidt and Erhard both pulled out their cigarette and their cigar to quietly celebrate this victory for their partner in the Army, much to the light displeasure of the Führer. Tresckow and Speidel respectfully gave their thanks to the Führer for keeping his word. It ended in their favor, and it was only appropriate for them to give some credit to their leader, no matter how reluctant he was.\n\nOnly Schörner fumed, unwilling to stand being in the same room as those who opposed him and with a Führer who let him down. In a huff, he stormed out of the Chancellery, much to the subtle joy of those who wished to spite him.\n\nAnd when news came to the German people about the lowered draft, there was much reason for them to rejoice. Families and friends were happy to know that their sons would not have to give up a part of their lives to serve the Fatherland.

Schörner had not noted them.\n\nThe Foreign Minister was the first to speak up. "So you're just going to shoot down what he has suggested? Just like that?" He shook his head at Speer, perplexing the man because of the way he said that.\n\nThe Führer told him, "Don't question it, Schmidt. Schörner had a point."\n\n"Indeed he has. But I don't agree. Tresckow had a better point. There's no point in wasting resources on maintaining a large army. Our country needs less force."\n\n"And our country needs more people to work with. For the sake of the economy!" Erhard joined in. Soon Kiesinger stood.\n\n"I stand with my colleagues. My Führer, you must reconsider."\n\nSpeidel nodded to this, keeping himself quiet as Tresckow spoke up once more, "My Führer, please, it must not be ignored. You must consider the benefits of lowering the draft. It will pay off much more than leaving it as it is now."\n\nSchörner bit at his lower lip and turned to Speer. The Führer looked at all of them in silent contemplation, under pressure as he realized everyone was pushing him to make a decision now. There was no way to stall them. It had to be done.

kiesingergo4.1.d:0 "Speer nodded approvingly as he downed the final page of the proposal. A nice fat dose of funding for education and healthcare, enough to make the Reich look like one of the most progressive nations on Earth, was sure to go over well with anyone who had half a brain. "Well, Herr Kiesinger," he said with an honest smile, "This is more like it. It's nice to have a proposal that won't anger at least half the Reichstag come to my desk."\n\nKiesinger chuckled warmly. "I'm sure, my Führer. Herr Erhard can be quite an overbearing man at times, can't he?"\n\n"Now," Speer began, steepling his fingers. "It will be quite expensive, won't it? Not that I'm opposed to it - just considering the whole picture."\n\n"Yes, my Führer, it will cost us a fair amount. I'm sure it won't be difficult to sell to the Reichstag, though. Many of the newer representatives are populists at heart, and once information about this becomes public they'll be under immense pressure to accept it."\n\nThe Führer took a moment to stew it over. The Reich's children certainly needed investment in their futures, and if the money was available to give citizens better quality healthcare, why not do it? With the military cuts and a rationalized taxation system, there really wasn't much of an argument against it. The money would just be sitting around gathering dust otherwise, waiting for some greedy bureaucrat to start picking away at it. "Very good, Parteikanzler," Speer finally said. A quick scratch of his pen, and the proposal bore the official signature of the Führer. "Deliver it with my commendation. You've truly outdone yourself, Herr Kiesinger.""

"What about it, Gehlen? Legislation isn't your business. What are you bothering me for?"\n\nGehlen sounded indignant - angry, even. "It is my business when our national security is at stake. We can't afford to have our academic base get out of hand. It's a spawning ground for Bolshevism, as I'm sure any seasoned intelligence officer could tell you. Need I remind you of the dissident groups that have already emerged from the student movement? Do you want a dozen more appearing every few months?"\n\n"Don't be so hyperbolic, Gehlen," Speer replied with a roll of his eyes. "You want to deny our youth the same education that our rivals enjoy because you're scared that it might make your job a little harder? You're going to need a better excuse than that to oppose this."\n\nThe line was silent for a moment as Gehlen composed himself. "My Führer," he said, voice smooth and inoffensive once more, "The less a man knows, the more pliable he remains. The world is a dangerous place - too dangerous for us to risk the growth of subversive academia. Bolshevism and its cohorts have always found a home amongst short-sighted young men and women. You must maintain control over our education system at all levels to secure the compliance of future generations. Think on it, my Führer."\n\n"

Herr Gehlen made a well-reasoned case."\n\n"Well-reasoned? The man's just being paranoid! Do you think the American government worries about what their younger citizens think in private? Do you think they care? We can't stop people having subversive thoughts - if they're even having them in the first place!"\n\n"Herr Kiesinger," Speer said, taking on a conciliatory tone. "Healthcare will still receive the funding it requires. And, you know, Gehlen is right: the world is a dangerous place, and our enemies will take any opportunity to spread un-German ideas amongst the youth. Germany certainly has a history of student radicalism already, so would it really be wise to encourage that?"\n\nKiesinger looked equal parts frustrated and baffled. "Un-German ideas? My Führer, this administration is built on 'un-German' ideas, no matter what we might tell the Party. Please, don't let Gehlen dictate policy to you. His opposition to this reform is obviously based on the interests of the RND, not the Reich as a whole."\n\nSpeer twiddled his thumbs beneath the desk. It did seem pointlessly obstructionist, but Gehlen had been forthcoming so far. Would he really act against the Reich's best interests? Would he really do that - just go to the Führer's office and tell lies?"

"My Führer, I just wanted to say thank you."\n\n"Oh," Speer smiled and went back to revising his newest speech. "Really, you needn't. You were overdue for a pay rise anyway."\n\n"It's not that, my Führer." Speer looked up again, puzzled. "I mean, this new legislation of yours the Reichstag just passed - it means a lot to me and... uh, to a lot of people I know, and people like me who grew up after the war. My wife can take up her degree again, and my mother doesn't have to choose between medicine and three square meals a day. So, um... thank you, my Führer."\n\nThe two men, separated by generations and, unbeknownst to Friedman, their politics, were silent for a moment. Then, Speer smiled again - sincerely, this time. "I'm glad to hear it. Making a difference to people like you was precisely the intention." Picking up his pen, Speer resumed his work, but not without one final smile and nod of approval at Friedman as he headed back to his desk with a little less weight on his heart."

He'd never expected to see the day when the reformers and Bormannites would agree on anything, but here it was.\n\n"Letter from Herr Gehlen, my Führer," said Friedman, his secretary, placing a pair of sealed envelopes on the desk. "And another from the Parteikanzler. That's all, my Führer."\n\nSpeer regarded Friedman with a suspicious eye as he headed out the door. The boy had been so empty-eyed and listless recently, even with his pay increase. Perhaps it was time to find someone more personable to greet visitors. For now, however, he had a pile of letters to get through.\n\nNone were positive, save Gehlen's. Naturally, the RND head was overjoyed to know that the youth wouldn't have a chance to get any funny ideas, nor to be educated above their stations without a substantial amount of family wealth behind them. Speer couldn't even bear to read Kiesinger's - criticism from his inner circle only fostered greater stress. Still, this wasn't a complete setback for reformism, so how could anyone truly fault him for his decision? Surely education would have another chance for reform further down the line, once national security was less of a concern."

"My Führer," Kiesinger began, "There's something that needs to be tended to. It is an issue we've left unsolved for far too long, and I believe that today is the day where we can decide on what to do with it." Speer tensed up, if only slightly. What was the man planning? "Go on, Herr Kiesinger. What is this issue that you want solved?"\n\nHe nodded politely. "It is the matter of our religious policy." Speer felt the fingers on his pen press just a bit harder. "Yes, what of it?" He asked. "My Führer, as it stands right now, the Reich maintains Hitler's anti-religious laws. But, over the past few decades, the demographics of what our people believe in has not shifted too drastically. A significant portion are still practicing Protestants and Catholics, and-", "Are you, Herr Kiesinger..." Speer started, "asking me to reverse this change? Do you not remember what our previous Führer's wishes were?" Kiesinger simply nodded again, which irritated Speer even more. "Of course I know, my Führer. But you also realize that you have promised us reform? We've been the backbone of your operations quite a while now, and nobody would find it satisfactory if..."\n\n"This again," Speer nearly hissed. "I'm being strong-armed into accepting your damn proposal. And if I refuse?" Kiesinger now shook his head. "I don't know exactly what would happen if you did, my Führer, but you have only to gain by following through with this policy. You will bring stability into the Reich, and those who have been oppressed will be happier to serve. Not only that, it will weaken the grip that the hardliners wish to hold against us." Speer glared at him for a while. He was making good points, that was true, but was he about to go back on his word? The consequences if he did so...\n\nAfter a while of unpleasant silence, Speer's gaze lowered back down to the papers in front of him. "Herr Kiesinger...""

"Whatever troubles befall your office, I am certain I can solve."\n\nSpeer leaned forward on his desk and put his hands together. "Herr Kiesinger, be well aware that much of the NSDAP will not be happy about this. The much unnecessary pressure will be far from helpful during this time. I hope you can keep them at bay." Kiesinger nodded politely.\n\n"Will that be all you require of me, my Führer?" He asked, and Speer looked to be actually thinking about the prospect for a few seconds, before merely shaking his head and speaking.\n\n"No, Herr Kiesinger. You are dismissed." When the Deputy Führer left the room, it entered into a stale, unpleasant silence. There were many names off the top of his head that he could name who would not appreciate this move.

But in a twist of fate that only served to make him even further annoyed, he had received letter after letter of high-ranking officials in the government, demanding that this be reversed. Though one in specific stood out - a letter with a particularly prestigious seal.\n\n"My Führer, I have heard about a deeply concerning change of pace within the upper echelons of the Volkshalle. Is this true? Are we stepping away from the building blocks that our previous Führer, Adolf Hitler, set for us? I, along with my allies and friends within the circles of the Reich, find ourselves worried that the integrity of National Socialist values will be threatened. Did we not talk about the futility of religion? Its needless superstition, and an insatiable desire to twist the present back towards the past? Not only that, but it is directly linked to the Jew. I will not speak of the attempts to synthesize our ideology and Christianity together, for it is an abomination, but rather I will speak of what secularization will lead to.\n\nWe have, thankfully, annihilated Judaism from Europa, but unfortunately, the claws of Abraham still follow us. I know that you, my Führer, have no love for Christ and his Jewry. And so I ask you to please reconsider what has been done. If you truly let our Reich slip into tolerating the Protestant and the Christian, then we will once again allow ourselves to be tainted by a religious ideology contrary to National Socialism, contrary to the thousand year Reich that we are to build, and contrary to our supremacy as an Aryan people. It is my hope that, when you receive this letter, you will quickly realize what decision to make.\n\nThe future of Germany is in your hands, my Führer, and I trust that you will make the right choice. - Reichsstatthalter Arthur Greiser of Wartheland."\n\nBy the end of it, Speer was gritting his teeth, wondering what the hell to do."

What was Kiesinger's previously boisterous and proud attitude crashed and burned like a zeppelin, and Kiesinger merely receded into silence. The seconds that passed were one of the most uncomfortable ones Speer felt in his entire life, and, daring not to move his eyes off of the Prussian, spot Kiesinger out from the corner of his eye, backing away, then moving behind Tresckow.\n\nThe man didn't even ask for permission to leave. Speer would have felt slighted for that, but by the circumstances right now, he wouldn't have bothered raising such protests. When the doorknob clicked open the door, Tresckow didn't move a muscle.

Putting his papers away, he knew that the man who was about to come in would force Speer to pay full attention to him, in no small part due to his nature. With a small cough and clearing of his throat, the Führer rested his face and put his hands together in waiting. With a sharp but careful swing of the door, Tresckow stepped in, closing it behind him as he gave a crisp salute. "Herr Speer!" He began, almost as if he was the Führer. "I have heard of the situation developing."\n\n"Really, Herr Tresckow?" Speer asked, raising an eyebrow at the Prussian. "As you know, Herr Speer," he began, body language loosening just slightly. "I am a man who sees clearly into the past, and all of the good that it has served us. Though I strive for what unified our nation - Prussian discipline, mettle, and spirit, there's another element limiting Germany from reaching its full potential!" Speer slid a hand up to the side of his face. "Go on, Herr Tresckow..." He weakly encouraged.\n\nHe nodded dutifully. "The essence of God has been restricted, Herr Speer." The military man sighed. "In my own homeland, I see Protestants thrown out of churches for only doing their duty. Elsewhere, Catholics are harassed and their sermons broken up by police." Tresckow stated, eyes narrowing just a little bit. He could recognize that look Speer was giving him. "You may not care much about it, but many of Germany's citizens do. The direction you're taking shall be antithetical to their beliefs. If you want to avoid decades of strife, then I suggest pressing through with allowing people to worship openly."\n\nSpeer glanced at him inquisitively. He offered no sympathy to religion, and would be happy to see it gone, but was it really worth backing down? The choice, then, was between upholding the future of a Germany free of religion, or guaranteeing stability by allowing them to practice their faith."

Exiting into the streets, the nicely-painted black letters against white said "GERMANY WITHOUT FAITH - GERMANY WITHOUT ITS SOUL!". He could see, in the far distance, the ominous and foreboding Volkshalle staring down at him as he gathered with his friends.\n\nAn hour and a half later, Josef rallied at the front, next to another ally of his who waved a flag around that spoke of a similar message. She was bolder, older than him - a veteran of these things, and he could always learn something new from her. But when they turned the street corner and met upon a patrol of military police, both parties stood dead in their tracks. Here, in Welthauptstadt Germania, was a small protest of ten marching about and wanting their freedom to ring true, and nobody was quite sure of what to do.\n\nThat was, until one of the policemen started cracking up. Nudging a fellow officer of his, they took a few minutes to find a megaphone, and with a click, they spoke. "The police is here to remind you all that Führer Speer has begun secularizing the anti-religious policies that have been currently instated." The tension between the two groups loosened significantly after that. "However, that still doesn't mean you can walk around and disrupt citizens. Go home and wait, unless you want to be punished." The casual tone of his voice slightly unnerved Josed, and he swallowed. There wasn't even a 'that is all', instead only the cutting of static as the policemen moved on."

 kiesingergo4.11.t:0 "The Redeemer In Chains"
 kiesingergo4.11.desc:0 "Every day, Nils had to stare it out of the window in his room. Every day, Nils locked eyes with that building, closed down, all the light of its life having left it so long ago. Every year, Nils hoped that something would change. That he would no longer have to do service to the Lord within the confines of his own home, always in danger of being watched by those that would want to stamp his faith out in these dark times. It had been so long, in fact, that only Nils remained to be the only one in his family who didn't just pay lip service to something that guided him for a lifetime. Even when he was told by his mother to stop fretting so much about prayer, and worry more about what would happen if he was caught, he did not relent. And for just a day, it seemed like his faith had proved its mettle, and its dedication.\n\nOne day, Nils had woken up to something different. The church was no longer dreadfully empty of souls. Instead, the lights had been turned on, and he could see his fellow Germans moving about. He took a care to not rush himself in excitement, however, as modesty remained an important concern. Yet... eventually, when he walked into that simple building, and met that familiar face of the preacher greeting him with a warmth that he lacked somehow back home, Nils felt at peace with himself. He heard it from one of his brothers that the government decreed a slow reversing of policy that would discriminate against the religious, and that made him both happy and shocked. What made them do such a thing? Perhaps someone had a change of heart. Whatever it was, he only hoped that it would remain that way.\n\nUntil it didn't. The next day afterwards, Nils nigh jumped out of his bed to see what state the church was in, and a low, sinking feeling overcame his stomach with what he saw. As if yesterday never happened, he saw soldiers guarding the front of the building, with people being ferried out, one by one. Perhaps they didn't have a change of heart at all, and it was all a charade - making a mockery of something they had already begun ruining. He found anger at the thought, and that anger did not abate when the hours passed. His family could see it, and his mother warned him to not be consumed by fury, but he knew better. Hours later, when Nils heard chanting from outside his house, he knew what to do. With a cross in one hand and a sturdy piece of wood concealed on his person, he went out to see a wave of people filling the street of the church, facing off against a squadron of military police."

 kiesingergo4.12.t:0 "Have You No Reason, Herr Speer?"
 kiesingergo4.12.desc:0 "After what felt like aeons of Speer staring at the Prussian, frozen still and staring at him with barely-concealed anger, Tresckow finally decides ro shatter the silence. Taking a deep breath, the disciplined Prussian stood firm. "Herr Speer." He began, voice cold and direct. "Do you realize what you are saying?" The Führer stared at him almost blankly, but nodded. "Yes, Herr Tresckow, I have said what I had on my mind. And?" If looks could hurt, then Tresckow's would be a wunderwaffe. "And? Herr Speer... I don't wish to cause a ruckus in your office, but you are causing a grave error as of this moment. I understand that you do not care about religion," and he was tempted to add 'instead you follow your own damnable devil', but relented. "I, however, put value on it. A value so high that, if I am still around to see it tarnished and ruined," he began, some frustration now clearly rising above the surface, "Stomped out in front of me, then, Herr Speer, I believe that my presence will no longer be necessary here."\n\nSpeer nearly flinched at the comment. Did Tresckow just imply a resignation? He balled a hand up into a fist and put it on the desk. "I... am I hearing you right, Herr Tresckow?" Speer asked, sounding taken aback. "You wouldn't do this. Not over something like this." The moment after he said that, the Prussian made a noise that sounded close to a hiss. "Of course I would!" He spoke, raising his voice that mixed anger and irritation together. "I cannot bother with being subtle about it, Herr Speer. If you want to snuff the light of religion in this country, then I shall not be here to see it, rest assured!" Speer glared at him. He couldn't tell if Tresckow would truly follow up on it, but he felt strongly like he would. "This... ridiculous dialogue of yours, is something I refuse to tolerate!" It felt like Speer's heart skipped a beat. Now a slow trickle of panic began filling his mind as Tresckow got more and more openly angry. "Herr Speer, you can consider my participation in this charade over!"\n\nAs Tresckow began turning around, he only had moments to think. He had to say something, because saying nothing would only serve to humiliate him. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Speer caught the Prussian's attention by saying..."
 kiesingergo4.12.a:0 "Hold on, damn it! I haven't even said anything yet!"
 kiesingergo4.12.b:0 "Leave then, Herr Tresckow! Your Prussian heritage means nothing here!"

 kiesingergo4.13.t:0 "Actually, Herr Tresckow, I Do"
 kiesingergo4.13.desc:0 "Tresckow stood in front of the door for a few seconds, in sullen, tense, and uncomfortable silence. Then, finally, Speer almost thanked a deity when the man finally spoke. "... Have you changed your mind?" The military man asked. Speer swallowed back doubt and reluctantly spoke. "Herr Tresckow, I... we can speak of this further. It doesn't have to end here." He could sense the other man's stance tightening, and then, after a few terse seconds, he looked down at the floor.\n\n"Herr Speer..." He began. "I'll hear you out." Yet he didn't bother to turn around. A part of Speer wanted to face him head-on, but another was glad that wasn't the case. "However, I believe I need... something." That didn't sound like good news. "Something?" Speer asked, and Tresckow nodded. "Yes. It is something I believe will resolve this situation amicably. In a way that, at least I will find satisfactory." No. It absolutely did not sound like good news - not at all. "Then," Speer began, sighing and rubbing his forehead. "Go and acquire this 'something' of yours. I don't-- we don't have all day."\n\nAgain, Tresckow nodded. Quick and professionally. "Certainly, Herr Speer. I bid you goodbye and will return to you in just a short while." Without waiting for a response, he reached for the door and pushed it open, politely closing it behind him as he left Speer to wonder in silence."
 kiesingergo4.13.a:0 "What the hell is he planning... ?"

 kiesingergo4.14.t:0 "Four Against One"
 kiesingergo4.14.desc:0 "Speer's fingers tightened against each other when he heard the knob of the door open. He was expecting Tresckow again, for sure, but what he saw not only surprised him, but shocked him.\n\nFirst came Tresckow. Then came another three - all faces he distinctly, immediately recognized. Helmut Schmidt, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Ludwig Erhardt. Three extra personalities he did not want to meet today. Though he wanted to sink back in his seat, he sat firmly, and eyed them all with a strong gaze. "So this is your something." He stated, giving the fiercest gaze to Tresckow, who looked back at him and betrayed no emotion. "Gentlemen?" Tresckow said, turning to the other three, and they all nodded.\n\n"I'll speak on behalf of all four of us," Kiesinger said, nodding towards Speer, who looked at him warily. "You're making a most unwise choice, my Führer. Herr Tresckow is firmly dedicated to Germany's long-valued Christian beliefs. To get rid of them now, well..." He shook his head. "I believe you're missing the point of this alliance.\n\nSpeer felt his pointer finger press hard on the wooden surface of his table. He was cornered. Like a caged animal, he was at his wits end. He could deal with Tresckow on his own, but this? "My Führer?" Kiesinger asked, snapping Speer out of his dazed state and forcing his focus back on the four. "We need a choice from you, and I will make you well aware that this mutual pact of ours does not only go one way." Speer could swear, out from the corner of his eye, that he could feel disciplined eyes trained on every fidget of his hands and muscle on his face - but something must be said. A decision had to come to fruition, else what masqueraded as a simple demand would unravel into something much worse. "
 kiesingergo4.14.a:0 "Of course I will listen. We can break this standstill."
 kiesingergo4.14.b:0 "I... I assert my authority! "

 kiesingergo4.15.t:0 "What Else, Really? "
 kiesingergo4.15.desc:0 "The five dispersed shortly afterwards that day, and they all had let out a collective sigh of relief. Except Speer. Backed into an ultimatum, now he further vested power into the damnable Gang, and he had nothing to show for it. No ulterior motives, no long-term plans, no shadows in the dark - and now, his pride would be turned against him, being forced to sit in his office and sign legislation after legislation about legalizing church practices and private worship. Not only that, but he had to deal with the bloody NSDAP.\n\nOr, at least, he would have. The next time Speer met Kiesinger, the air between them wasn't the happiest, but he was told that the most stringent of responses would be avoided and minimized to his office. He had helped the Gang, and so the Gang would help him. Not only that, in but a few days he had already received letters from Christians coming from all parts of Germany, thanking him for beginning the process of reversing decades of discrimination. Some were less grateful than others, but Speer felt bitter all the same. He never planned to secularize, but outside forces forced his hand, and, to further humiliate him, made it so that he looked like the man behind the job."
 kiesingergo4.15.a:0 "Another vision to give up."

 kiesingergo4.16.t:0 "Moment Of Prescience"
 kiesingergo4.16.desc:0 "When the words left his mouth, he froze. Regret immediately came to him, and as his eyes shifted towards where Tresckow would be, all he was met with was the slam of the door closing behind an incredibly irate Prussian. The rest stared at him, a mixture of frustrated and purely dumbfounded. Erhard looked disgusted. Schmidt seemed irritated, and Kiesinger was disappointed, merely sighing and shaking his head. "A grave mistake, my Führer. I truly hoped it wouldn't come to this."\n\n"What do you mean?" Speer asked through gritted teeth. "You're not telling me he's-", "Resigning?" Kiesinger finished, and his expression dropped further. The air in the room continued to still. "By tomorrow, I am afraid."\n\nAs Speer struggled to recompose himself, Erhard drew in his cigar and puffed out some smoke, giving Speer a nasty glare. "I'll think on what happens next. The rest of you two can stay here and do whatever, but I'm leaving." As he did, Schmidt spoke up soon afterwards. "Actually... I believe I will go too. This has given me food for thought, and, well..." He nodded towards Speer, who looked lost for words. "Goodbye, my Führer."\n\nIt was only Kiesinger left standing, and he could read Speer like a book. "No point in you staying here," Speer almost snarled. "Go. Leave. You must have business to attend to, I'm sure." He was losing strength and energy to speak with every passing word, but Kiesinger merely nodded. "Of course I do, my Führer. Goodbye.""
 kiesingergo4.16.a:0 "Speer didn't get anything done that day."

 kiesingergo4.17.t:0 "Have Some Courtesy"
 kiesingergo4.17.desc:0 "Speer dreaded going to his office that morning. So much so that it took him almost half an hour extra before he exited his house, and he barely paid attention to whatever his chauffeur wanted to talk about. He wanted - no, he needed something to prevent him from going to do his job. Just for that day. Just so that he could have time off. There was nothing, however. There was no terrorist threat. There was no assassination attempt. Instead, the Führer simply crossed the streets of Germania, safe and sound as many other citizens of the Reich.\n\nWhen he came to his door, his hand grasped at the doorknob for much longer than he needed to. When he pushed it down, it felt like he had to use all the strength in his body to do so. When he walked in, his eyes looked at everything. The windows, the outside. The decorating, the cabinets. The papers.\n\nThe letters. He could spot their signatures from even where he was standing. Tremors began to slowly wrack up his torso and spread to his limbs as he counted them. Not even a last goodbye. Like snakes, they shed their skins and left. When his hand touched upon the surface of one letter, - Tresckow's, of course it stood at the top - a pang of guilt passed by his heart. In this Reich, however, one could not feel guilt. One could only move forward. Speer considered reading the letters; something useful to extract, perhaps. Then he realized that nothing about it was important. Not anymore.\n\nAnd so they were thrown into the trash. Unopened, unread. Left to wilt into nothingness. Words written would remain words unsaid, but they burned into Speer's mind."
 kiesingergo4.17.a:0 "Then there was one."

 kiesingergo4.18.t:0 "An Alliance In Tatters"
 kiesingergo4.18.desc:0 "Speer pretended he was alright. He pretended that he had eaten three meals today. He pretended that he drank enough water appropriate for a man of his age. He pretended Germany was fine. He pretended that there was no migraine crawling up the back of his skull, and how he hadn't stopped shaking for most of the day, and how his mind wasn't a flash of thought patterns that resembled nothing coherent.\n\nSpeer wanted to pretend he was alright. But nothing was. Not after the empire of his dreams crumbled before his eyes, and from the rubble he picked and pulled his hands into, all that remained was the torn-up flag of the Reich. The tilted swastika staring back at him. He would have welcomed it, but now all that was left was its corrupted form, hollow and distorted. Since the Gang left, Speer came to a cold, cruel realization - one he knew from the start, but refused to acknowledge. It faced him here, in his study room, locked inside his own home, his mind swimming in a pool of painful memories and even more painful truths.\n\nThere was only one thing left for him. Only one avenue of support. A force that would corrupt him, too. But it was better him than anyone else. Even with his vision broken, he had a glimmer of hope that he could steer the wheel and prevent it from turning all the way. No longer could he think of a bright Germany.\n\nOnly one shrouded in darkness, the grip of the NSDAP slowly crushing the flickering light of true National Socialism. Now, he would stray down the path of insanity that would border him on all sides. He could only hope that he was not consumed by it."
 kiesingergo4.18.a:0 "There is nothing to do but serve. And serve I shall."

 kiesingergo4.19.t:0 "Hope You Guessed My Name"
 kiesingergo4.19.desc:0 "He felt glued to his chair. In fact, Speer felt like he was trapped in his office. Is this what claustrophobia felt like? Except the walls were too wide, the windows too open. His ears perked up to the sounds of cars passing by the street outside, and the wind blowing through the air. His eyes failed - perhaps purposefully - to notice the stack of papers on his desk. He didn't give them a look. Recently, he had developed a hate of letters. If someone asked him why, he would simply shrug, and tell them that he didn't really know why.\n\nHe would have been content with sitting there, doing nothing, for hours on end, until he got the opportunity to go home and do more of nothing. But silence never lasted long. At some point during the day, some hours in the afternoon, the phone in his office rang. The noise was shrill and piercing for his ears, but it alerted him quickly, and in a haze of sudden anger and irritation he grabbed it roughly and put it up against his ear. "Who is this?" He demanded.\n\n"Hmm. You should recognize me by voice alone," the other voice on the line spoke, and Speer could feel his anger receding instantly. "I am Theodor Oberländer. Quite... the important figure in the NSDAP. I believe I can make my services of use to you."\n\nThere were no protests. Ever since the Gang left, the reformist clique in the NSDAP would begin their eventual collapse. Only the reactionaries were left. The visionaries who twisted National Socialism and dragged it through mud and blood, and Speer could only slow it down. "I've recently come to the knowledge that your cabinet has resigned. A true shame." Nothing betrayed Oberländer's voice. "Not to worry. The NSDAP has always been a strong force, and since I am at the helm of the ones who used to oppose you, well... stability will come easy. Rest assured, this will be a fruitful venture. Now... I needn't waste more of your time, though I will tell you one thing." Speer gripped the phone in his hand tightly, and a part of him wanted to smash it against his desk. "Regardless of how you were as Führer before...""
 kiesingergo4.19.a:0 ""You shall be an excellent Führer now.""

 kiesingergo4.20.t:0 "Resolving The Stand-Off"
 kiesingergo4.20.desc:0 ""That would be too risky of a development," Speer said, waving off Kiesinger. "I already have the hardliners breathing down my neck. If we were to propose this secularization, they may just take the opportunity to corner our influence." Kiesinger breathed irritation and exhaled calm. Of course Speer would try to downplay the idea. That should have come as no surprise, but he was expecting less resistance than a hard no. Still, it wasn't a catastrophe.\n\nKiesinger nodded politely. "Of course, my Führer. While I would drop the topic..." Speer had a feeling there wasn't an end to this yet. "There is more that remains unaddressed. In fact, I believe I may bring you something to settle your doubts once and for all." Speer raised an eyebrow. "Something?" He asked. "Do you mean, perhaps, to bring me answers?" Kiesinger once again nodded. "If you may, my Führer - I shall leave, and return soon with answers in tow."\n\nSpeer looked at him with suspicion, but held his tongue on the more unsavoury things he wanted to say. Instead, he let out a short sigh. "You are dismissed, Herr Kiesinger. And do not take too long. I've not all day." As Kiesinger thanked the man and left the room, Speer was left to his thoughts."
 kiesingergo4.20.a:0 "What is Kiesinger's game?"

 kiesingergo4.27.t:0 "The Curtain Opens"
 kiesingergo4.27.desc:0 "When Speer heard two pairs of footsteps outside his door, one was calm and normal. The other, he realized, moments before the door swung open, was von Tresckow.\n\nKiesinger merely gave Speer a friendly glance as Tresckow nigh stomped inside into his office. He gave a crisp, though annoyed salute, and spoke. "Herr Speer!" He said, demanding the fading attention of the Führer. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger?" He asked in return, and the Prussian straightened himself up. "I will make this brief, but the message shall surely resound with you. Herr Speer, do you remember one of the primary goals of our alliance?" Speer nodded. "I remember all of them. What are you referring to, exactly?" He asked, shifting somewhat uncomfortably in his seat.\n\nTresckow harrumphed. "Freedom!" He exclaimed. "The freedom of Germany's people. Is that not one of the main things we've been promised? I would say that it is one of the tenets crafted into the political web we've created for each other!" Speer felt his energy draining after each and every word Tresckow spoke. "And what is the most prized freedom of them all, than the freedom of worship?" His gaze affixed on Speer's eyes, and the Führer could not dare to look away from him.\n\n"My Führer." Kiesinger said. "I believe Herr Tresckow will remain unsullied by the reply of silence. I advise..." He looked at Tresckow, who seemed intent to keep staring at Speer. "... for you to answer him." Then he looked back at Speer, who seemed deep in thought, though not for reasons the Prussian would hope for. The room remained silent for a few seconds more, but after long enough, Speer broke the silence. He was to determine the mood shift with what he said, and there were two lines of thought he could pursue."
 kiesingergo4.27.a:0 "The NSDAP is dangerous."
 kiesingergo4.27.b:0 "We cannot tarnish National Socialism's values any further."

 kiesingergo4.21.t:0 "To Reveal Fright"
 kiesingergo4.21.desc:0 ""The..." Speer sighed. "The NSDAP is a dangerous force, Herr Tresckow." The Prussian felt like he wanted to roll his eyes. What a silly, generic response. But it prevented another outburst from the man. Speer noted Tresckow's pose slightly relaxing, and he felt the smallest weight come off his shoulders. Kiesinger, however, looked fully unconvinced, yet let the man speak.\n\n"There is a significant amount of them that still oppose us at every turn!" He noted. "If we did something as extreme as this, they would jump at the opportunity to decry us as radicals. They could raise hell in the Reichstag, and... impede us at every point they could! It's simply something I find difficult to convince the hardliners on." As the two listened on, Speer's spiel seemed to have the opposite effect on their opinion - especially Kiesinger, who merely shook his head and sighed."
 kiesingergo4.21.a:0 ""Let me make a counter-point...""

 kiesingergo4.22.t:0 "The Curtain Begins Closing"
 kiesingergo4.22.desc:0 ""Go on, Herr Kiesinger..." Speer trailed off, feeling frustrated that he couldn't give much of a good argument in his favor.\n\nKiesinger nodded. "You speak of the consequences, but that is exactly why you should go through with this decision, my Führer. To the people, you are their leader." He stated the obvious, but Speer had a feeling that wasn't just it. "To the party, however..." Speer's eyes tightened just enough for Kiesinger to notice. And ignore, as his smile widened the slightest bit. "Well, you are no dictator. You do not make every rule and judgement."\n\n"So you are to take the fall?" Speer asked, and Kiesinger shook his head once again. "No, no. Better than that. I am not Deputy Führer for no reason. I will manage whatever the more unsavory part of the NSDAP shall unleash on us. I merely ask that you let this reform pass. Whatever happens, it shall be under my jurisdiction to take care of."\n\nSpeer pressed his palms against each other harder than normal. Again, Tresckow and Kiesinger fell into silence as the Führer thought, and they thought it better to let him think. And think he did. After almost a full ten seconds, Speer exhaled deeply and spoke."
 kiesingergo4.22.a:0 "This will be your problem now. Not mine."
 kiesingergo4.22.b:0 "I'm afraid, Herr Kiesinger, that it is too much of a risk."

 kiesingergo4.23.t:0 "The Curtain Falls"
 kiesingergo4.23.desc:0 "Kiesinger stared at Speer like a Nazi would at a Bolshevik. Yet, at the same time, it was subdued. Fading so quickly that Speer only caught a glimpse of the anger Kiesinger felt before it either vanished or remained, hidden behind Kiesinger's veil. Tresckow, meanwhile, looked almost stunned. "I have said what I have said, Herr Kiesinger. Do not expect me to relent on this decision."\n\nKiesinger exchanged a glance at Tresckow, who seemed stuck in thought. Then he coughed uncomfortably, and looked towards Speer, fixing up the tie on his suit. "If that's the case, then I needn't be here any longer. Am I dismissed, my Führer?" Speer eyed the Prussian with a sense of worry and confusion. He barely overheard Kiesinger's words, but gave a half-nod. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger... you are dismissed."\n\nAs the Deputy Führer left the room, he gave his last parting words as the Prussian seemed to regain his clarity."
 kiesingergo4.23.a:0 "It seems like Herr Tresckow is not done. Good luck, my Führer."

 kiesingergo4.24.t:0 "To Reveal An Inkling Of Madness"
 kiesingergo4.24.desc:0 "He didn't feel sure about this. But maybe- maybe it would work. "Well..." Speer began, as the two stared at him with a modicum of surprise. "You've heard me. Have the two of you forgotten what our Germany was built on?" He continued, feeling the ember of spirit embed itself in his voice, just a notch above the desperation he felt moments before. "It was the ideology that had the world in its grasp for decades!"\n\nHe could feel the disappointment emanating from them. Maybe he just struck the wrong chord? "The only reason why we are declining now is because we're moving past our roots! What made us strong! Germany needs its previous faith no more!" At that, Tresckow visibly began getting upset. Kiesinger, meanwhile, fell into neutrality - not a hint of emotion betraying his face.\n\n"And..." Speer continued, taking a moment to process and discard his regret. "To go back to the time where we were great, we cannot capitulate to these new ideas that want to drag us into the past!" When he stopped, he could only hesitantly look at Tresckow, who was positively brewing. Speer wanted to say something, but the Prussian fired the first shot."
 kiesingergo4.24.a:0 ""Herr. Speer.""

 kiesingergo4.25.t:0 "Purity Of Sin"
 kiesingergo4.25.desc:0 "It was like a ghost spoke to Speer. He froze still, and in a way, so did Kiesinger.\n\n"I am not a stupid man, Herr Speer." Tresckow said, glaring at Führer with enough strength to make the man feel like he was facing down a member of the SS. "Perhaps you take me as silly. Naïve, even. But that would be far from the truth." His sigh approached a growl, and Speer felt his throat going dry. "The past, Herr Speer? Really, now? The past that has shaped our entire culture from birth to present?! I have tolerated this insofar as having the idea that you would listen to Herr Kiesinger, as he speaks with reason, but I am mistaken."\n\nSpeer's eyes flicked back and forth between the two, but he dared not interrupt the Prussian. "Do you think these men and women some... some bandits?" He asked. "Some bomb-throwing anarchists? If so, I am shocked Germany is not up in flames from these Christians." Kiesinger shook his head. "No. The truth is much simpler. These are people - my people! They wish to be left in peace. To pray to their sole creator, and follow the path the Lord has given them!"\n\n"So, Herr Speer?" He asked, tightening a fist and quietly gritting his teeth towards the Führer. "Will you go against the will of the majority? They only wish for peace. Nothing more. And I would advise listening to the people's will. After all..." Tresckow's eyes narrowed. "That has always been the job of the Führer."\n\nKiesinger remained deathly quiet. Speer, meanwhile, felt like he faced down the barrel of a gun. Whatever he said, he had to mean it. So eventually, Speer regained his composure, and mustered a reply. "
 kiesingergo4.25.a:0 "Perhaps your points are sound, Herr Kiesinger."
 kiesingergo4.25.b:0 "These values... they... they mean nothing to me!"

 kiesingergo4.26.t:0 "Of Weak Resolve"
 kiesingergo4.26.desc:0 "Immediately, Tresckow loosened his body language. Then, Kiesinger broke out into a sigh he didn't know he was holding. Speer, meanwhile, wasn't done yet. Clearly sounding unsatisfied, he spoke like a man being forced to speak under threat od torture. "I do not want to see a single paper pertaining to any important member in the NSDAP. Do you understand, Herr Kiesinger?" He pointedly asked, and the man regained his focus to meet his gaze at him.\n\n"Of course I do, my Führer. I will try my best to cow the hardliners. Otherwise..." He looked towards Tresckow. "It seems to me like you're satisfied." When the Prussian was addressed, he straightened his back and stiffened his body once again. "Why wouldn't I? Today is a great day for Germany's people!" He exclaimed, then sighed. "This means I must have business to attend to." He said, and Speer gave him the slightest look of suspicion that he merely ignored. "Herr Speer," he addressed, prompting the Führer to listen closely. "Are we dismissed?"\n\nFeeling content in the fact that this was at least finally resolved - though far from being in his favor - he nodded."
 kiesingergo4.26.a:0 "The rest of the day went by, as monotonous as any other."

 kiesingergo4.29.t:0 "Down To Ground Level"
 kiesingergo4.29.desc:0 ""... That is to say, points different from what you would want me to agree on." Speer continued, and Tresckow began seizing on hostility in his eyes before suddenly realizing what the man meant, giving the Führer a small scare as the Prussian calmed down. Kiesinger, meanwhile, rubbed his forehead and grit his teeth for a second or two before speaking. "What, ah... what were these points you agreed on, my Führer?"\n\nSpeer almost audibly grumbled when asked to clarify. "Primarily one. It's the fact that, yes, I did promise some form of liberalization to Germany." He well and truly hated that word, but couldn't dodge saying it. "I suppose that... secularizing the country can fall under one of those freedoms." At that, Tresckow seemed to undergo some sort of mood swing, now standing properly and his gaze significantly softening to something more reasonable.\n\n"Ha-ha! I'm glad you see light to reason, Herr Speer!" He said, only prompting the Führer to feel more defeated - he wouldn't bother countering that. Tresckow nodded towards Kiesinger. "This calls for a celebration, doesn't it?" Kiesinger gave a somewhat meek nod, which Tresckow merely chuckled at. "Alright, well, I may at least celebrate this victory in private." Turning towards Speer, he continued. "Now, are we to be dismissed?"

RND.1.t:0 "The First Report"
RND.1.d:0 "TO: Führer Albert Speer\n\nFROM: Präsident Reinhard Gehlen\n\nSUBJECT: Special Operations\n\nMein Führer,\n\nAs per your orders, I have compiled a list of potential targets for any potential actions. While these targets may not be your top threats, they are the ones we are currently able to handle without sparking suspicion. I trust that you will deem these candidates as acceptable losses to protect your position. Each of these targets, if not dealt with swiftly and decisively, could use their knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET ONE: Karl Brandt, administrator of the Aktion T4 euthanasia program. Has close knowledge of your involvement in the Aktion T4 program- could use against you. NOTE: Despite your close personal connection to Herr Brandt, he poses a great danger to the security of your regime, particularly your support among the reformists.\n\nTARGET TWO: Karl Hanke, Gauleiter of Lower Silesia. Recommended you to Herr Goebbels, initiating your rise in the party. Knows of many of your controversial acts- very dangerous. RND sources indicate ties to SS-Ordenstaat Burgund. NOTE: Once again, despite your close connections, Hanke possesses a great threat to your power and influence, and may use his knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET THREE: Hans Kammler, engineer. Noted for his work on the V-2 Rocket. Once a subordinate of yours. Knows of your previous usage of and position on slaves. No personal connections- could leverage knowledge against you.\n\nOnce again, each of these men holds a sword of Damocles over you and your Fuhrership, and may drop it at any time. The longer we wait to deal with these issues, the more likely it is that one leverages their knowledge against you. I highly recommend immediate action.\n\nYours, Präsident Reinhard Gehlen."

RND.2.d:0 "Speer paused for a moment, tears welling in his eyes. The small crowd hung onto his every motion as if they were glued to him. Finally, after a moment to collect himself, Speer began.\n\n "I'm heartbroken, absolutely heartbroken, to be here today, mourning the passing of one of my oldest friends. Karl Brandt was a good man. He was a man dedicated to science and medicine, and he was one of my closest friends back in the day. Though we may have drifted apart as time went on, the bond that was shared between us never died, and I could not possibly express my full grief at his untimely passing. That an automobile accident struck down such a gem of our Reich serves as a terrible reminder that all of us are merely human, and must treasure and cherish our days on Earth. . ."\n\nHowever, if Karl Brandt, currently resting peacefully in his coffin, could speak instead of Speer, his story would have been vastly different than the eulogy that the Führer gave. Perhaps he would have regaled the audience with how, while he was returning from work, a truck veered out in front of him, forcing him off the road at high speeds. He may have emphasized how, while he was dazed and stunned by the crash, multiple RND men surrounded his vehicle. He certainly would have screamed about how the man in front of the wreck, noticing how Brandt still moved, drew his pistol and put one bullet directly through Brandt's skull. Brandt would have closed his tale on the fire, set by those same men that killed him, that engulfed the car and destroyed the evidence that they had ever been involved.\n\nBut Karl Brandt was dead, and so the crowd gave a standing ovation to their Führer as he concluded, not even suspecting the truth behind the untimely death of Karl Brandt."

RND.3.d:0 "KATTOWITZ - Tragic news for the Reich's bureaucrats today as Karl Hanke, a personal friend of the Führer and decorated former Gauleiter of Silesia, has been murdered! The stalwart veteran of the NSDAP had been holidaying at a hunting lodge near Kattowitz with Silesian troops on leave, but failed to return from his evening walk last night. When the soldiers went out to search for him the following morning, they found Hanke lying unresponsive against a tree, with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. One of the Landsers, a medic, pronounced Hanke dead at the scene. A subsequent coroner's report found that Hanke had been dead for several hours before being discovered. More concerningly, it has been confirmed that Hanke was shot with a Polish submachine gun or pistol, casings from which were found nearby. Local Ordnungspolizei officers confirmed that a Polish terrorist cell had been active across the border with the General Government in recent years, and at least one member remained at large.\n\n"This is a terrible shock to me," said the Führer of Hanke's murder. "As many Party faithful know, it was Hanke's recommendation to the late Dr. Goebbels that began my career in the government. Not only do I owe him my position as Führer, but he was also a dear friend and confidant of many years. I hope with all my heart that our brave police officers and detectives can bring this case to a satisfying conclusion and enact justice for my friend and colleague."\n\nKarl Hanke had been a mildly controversial figure in recent years, owing to his long-standing support for the SS. He faced criticism at times from fellow NSDAP members for his political views, but was fully exonerated of alleged ties to treasonous elements by the Führer himself shortly after the Bürgerkrieg. Hanke is survived by his wife, Baroness Freda von Fircks, and their daughter."

His uniform, exquisitely ironed and cleaned, made even Speidel's uniform look messy and rumpled- and Speidel's uniform was holding up better than most. Together, they passed their report to the Fuhrer. If Tresckow's uniform looked tidy, and Speidel's looked alright, then Speer's suit looked like a mess of wrinkles and ink marks.\n\n"Herr Speidel, Herr Tresckow. May I have an explanation of your plan?" Speer spoke softly, his eyes crossing the lettering. Tresckow cleared his throat before beginning.\n\n "Germany holds numerous clear advantages over the new Polish state, but the most obvious one is our military advantage, Herr Speer. The Heer dwarfs anything the Poles could throw up. I propose that we use this fact to our advantage." Speidel nodded in agreement. Speer put the paper back down.\n\n"Invasion?" He asked bluntly. Tresckow's brow furrowed before he continued.\n\n"No, no- at least, not preferably. The threat of invasion should be more than sufficient to force the Poles to bend the knee. Besides that, multiple actions that benefit Poland will hopefully aid in creating a perception that we are no longer imperial maniacs, but rather a benevolent custodian."\n\nSpeer smiled. "I like it. You have my full permission to go ahead."\n\n"And, my Fuhrer, if they refuse- well, the threat of invasion is not an empty one." Speidel added, a faint smile crossing his lips.

The issue of who to select for the occupation of Poland was a prickly one, and the two letters sitting on Speer's desk painted both sides nicely. On one hand was a letter from Tresckow, recommending an old army friend- Werner Schrader. The main part of Tresckow's pitch was Schrader's history in the Wehrmacht- a history of resistance to the greatest atrocities the Heer pulled off. Tresckow's argument rested upon this resistance- after all, would a standard Wehrmacht man be able to hold onto control in Poland without compromising the new face of the Reich?\n\nThe second letter was much more infuriating. Coming directly from Ferdinand Schorner- the root of all evil, Speer thought- this letter seemed directly out of the 40's. A screed against the Reich's new course, the Reich's decision on Poland, and the Polish nation in general, Schorner's letter called for an immediate reversal back into the genocidal policies of the Reich's earlier days. Incredible, Speer thought. To Schorner, everything was the nail, and he was always the hammer. It's as if he didn't realize that the war was over.\n\nThe choice was obvious. Speer sent a letter back to Tresckow, granting his approval of Schrader's portfolio. As a near afterthought, he swept Schorner's letter into the trash."

As they drove through, tank commanders kept their hatches down and their guns up, ready for the attack they knew was coming.\n\nAnd yet, with every kilometer they drove with no interruption, their fear began to turn to disbelief. When they reached their first town, each and every tank commander silently sweat as the division of Armia Krajowa they were to disarm stood at attention. This is it, most thought. This was the moment where it all went to hell.\n\nWhen the Poles actually began to hand over their rifles, the disbelief was written all the 10th's faces as they handed out their medicine and food.

Necks craned as German guards hopped from their carriages, securing a perimeter and a way out of the crowd. The tension in the air grew thick and heavy as the doors to the carrier cars opened.\n\nWhen the first slave, still in his prison uniform, stepped slowly into the sun, there was a moment of disbelief. Suddenly, the crowd exploded into cheers, chanting, yelling, and the police line buckled under the weight of thousands straining against them. As the slaves walked down the passage set out for them, flowers poured down onto their heads. Families strained to see loved ones.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the first truly joyous day for all of Poland since the revolution- their men were coming home. If the Germans were coming with them, so be it."

speerpoland.6.t:0 "The Polish Accept"
speerpoland.6.d:0 "Good news from Warsaw today. It seems that the Polish government has recognized its hopeless situation and, seeing no other alternative, has decided to give in. Speidel's offer has been accepted in full, and the stipulations of the peace are already beginning to be enforced.\n\nSpeer smiled when he read the message, already feeling the constant headache he had begin to clear. Thank god for Speidel. No treaty terms, no negotiations, no back and forth. Just a simple, clear statement and a simple, clear response. No Germans would die over Poland, and another victory for Speer would be delivered to his doorstep.\n\nAs he sat down, he made a mental reminder to invite Speidel over for a drink or two sometime. The man certainly deserved it."
speerpoland.6.a:0 "Splendid."

speerpoland.7.t:0 "The Polish Decline"
speerpoland.7.d:0 "Stunning news from Warsaw today- the Polish government has lost its mind. At least, that's the assumption of the Fuhrer's office, as instead of the diplomatic victory we expected, we've been delivered a bewildering refusal of our terms. To call this unexpected would be a massive understatement, as would it be a massive understatement to call this foolish. Poland stands no chance against the Reich's war machine- indeed, it seems this decision is made only in a desperate grasp to retain a sense of national pride. Whatever the motive, it seems that violence is inevitable.\n\nSpeer could feel his headache pulsate with every word of the refusal he read. Enraged, he tossed the letter into his trashcan. Were they serious? Did they think they would stand any chance against the Heer? Was this all merely an attempt to make Speer's life as hard as possible? In any case, it was clear- German boots would march over the Polish plains once again as invaders. The Fuhrer sighed as he sat down- this would be a mess in the Reichstag. He could only hope that Speidel was not as bad a commander as he was a negotiator."
speerpoland.7.a:0 "Damn it."

speerpoland.8.t:0 "Speak Softly"
speerpoland.8.d:0 ""So, Herr Schmidt. I've read about your plan." Speer looked up from his desk, his eyes meeting his Foreign Minister's. "I'd like you to explain it to me more, because frankly, I don't understand why we need to go to this much effort over a place like Poland."\n\nSchmidt straightened his tie. "It's less about Poland itself and more about the international effects, my Fuhrer."\n\nSpeer leaned back in his chair. "Elaborate."\n\n "Well, we could enforce our will through force of arms on the Poles, as we did in the 30's, but the main issue is that internationally, this would threaten our image as a reformist, gentler Reich."\n\n"The issue with your plan, Herr Schmidt, is that it's going to force us into promises we might not want to keep."\n\n"I understand my plan is not perfect, but it is the only way to keep our image safe. Besides, negotiation means no bloodshed, and neither of us want that, do we?" Schmidt smiled.\n\n "No, of course not. I give you permission to go ahead. Don't screw this up for me, will you?" Speer shuffled in his chair. Schmidt nodded before leaving the room, the hopes of the Reich's new standing resting squarely on his shoulders."
speerpoland.8.a:0 "We'll see how this goes."

speerpoland.9.t:0 "Offer for Diplomacy from Germany"
speerpoland.9.d:0 "Surprising news has come from Germania today- it seems that Helmut Schmidt, the Reich's foreign minister, wishes to negotiate a peace between the Reich and Poland. Should we agree to this? If we decline, the Reich may invade- something which, despite our best hopes, will be nearly impossible to defeat."
speerpoland.9.a:0 "Agree"
speerpoland.9.b:0 "Decline"

speerpoland.10.t:0 "A Step Towards the Future"
speerpoland.10.d:0 "The news passed through the Foreign Ministry's hands quickly, fast tracked to two offices- Helmut Schmidt's and Albert Speer. The message read like a celebration- the Poles had, after much consideration and debate, accepted talks with Helmut Schmidt. Together, they wrote, they hoped that Poland and Germany would work together to take Europe into an ascendant future, these talks being the groundworks to lay such a foundation. Of course, it was all diplomatic flattery for now- nobody would dare to be brutally honest this early- but it was enough for Germany, and it was certainly enough for Schmidt and Speer.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert read the letter with a sigh of relief as he took a drink. Worries danced in his mind- what if they forced the Reich's hand? What if Schmidt promised the stars and the sun?- but he sidelined them for now. For now, things were moving along smoothly. Speer had to admit, despite his personal dislike of Schmidt, he got things done.\n\nIn Schmidt's office, Helmut took the news joyously. He had expected them to accept, but it actually happening gave him an opening. With the cooperation of the Poles, he could help set things right, once and for all, and Europe would be one step closer to the light."
speerpoland.10.a:0 "The hopes of Poland rest uneasy."

speerpoland.11.t:0 "Falling Back"
speerpoland.11.d:0 "The news shattered the morale of every hand it touched- a lightning strike to the reformists, a frustrating setback to the Speerites. It slowly slid its way through the Foreign Ministry, to be deposited with a thump on the desks of Speer and Schmidt. The news it communicated would be dismissed as comedy if it wasn't so real- the Poles, for whatever insane reason, had declined to negotiate, promising to defend Poland to the final man. Negotiations were dead before they even had the chance to begin.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert sat with a mixture of a sigh and an angered grunt. He'd listened to Schmidt for once, and look where it got them. The Poles thought they were weak, thought that Germany wouldn't be willing to take them on, all because Schmidt had decided to try and throw a rabid dog a carrot. Now, the Heer would need to get its hands dirty. He could already see the coffins, draped in the swastika, coming home from whatever muddy hellhole the Poles were in now. He could see the shitshow in the Reichstag from a mile away. Schmidt had gotten his way, and now look what had happened.\n\nIn Schmidt's office was, somehow, even more depressed than Speer's. Helmut slammed the letter into his trashcan with an angry grunt. He'd gambled, and somehow the Poles had screwed him over for it. What did they expect to happen? All they had done was make things worse for everyone. He sat down and awaited the angry call from a million different officials- the plan had collapsed, and here he was with a giant target on his back. He downed a drink before he took the first one."
speerpoland.11.a:0 "What do they think they're doing?"

speerpoland.12.t:0 "Germans in Poland"
speerpoland.12.d:0 "The tension between the two delegations lay thick and heavy in the conference room. Schmidt's eyes nervously darted across the faces of the Polish negotiators, settling finally on their head- one Stanislaw Wachowiak. Wachowiak's eyes bored right into Schmidt as the clock hit 12, and the meeting officially began.\n\nThe initial pleasantries soon faded away into a mess of diplomatic jargon, as veiled barbs and offers soon flew across the table. Unsurprisingly, it was not long before the first roadblock hit- the status of Germans in Poland.\n\n"The privileges that Germans in Poland held under the Generalgouvernement are unacceptable! We're practically chattel compared to them! Second class citizens in our own nation! We cannot, repeat, cannot go back to the old way of things- not now, not ever! They cannot continue to hold the privileges that they once did!" Wachowiak finished his fiery rant with a hearty slap of the table, to applause from his own delegation. The German delegation turned to Schmidt, his face deep in thought. A partial repeal of the Nuremberg Laws- something he'd wanted for years, but something that may fall well afoul of Speer's expectation. Besides, removing the rights of Germans for the wants of Poles- a group that much of Germany still considered "Untermensch''- was undoubtedly a shit show waiting to happen in itself. However, would the Poles accept a deal without this caveat? He sighed before responding, knowing these words would follow him forever."
speerpoland.12.a:0 "Keep up the Laws."
speerpoland.12.b:0 "The Poles deserve rights."

speerpoland.13.t:0 "Status of the Home Army"
speerpoland.13.d:0 ""Now, Mr. Wachowiak, onto the next topic- the Home Army." Schmidt read from his agenda slowly, taking a breath before continuing. "As previously agreed, the Home Army will disarm and disband, assuming these talks go through. This is correct, yes?"\n\n"Of course." Wachowiak straightened his tie as he spoke. Schmidt rolled his eyes as he reached the next point, bracing himself for the explosion.\n\n"Yes, of course. However, there have been calls from our more conservative counterparts to prosecute some of these men for, ah. . .'' Schmidt could see Wachowiak turning red in the face already, and he readied himself for the explosion. "Ah, treason and terrorism. Now, Mr. Wachowiak, these men did commit acts of violence against the German garrison-"\n\nWachowiak shot to his feet. "You're joking, Herr Schmidt! You can't be serious! You dare call fighting for freedom terrorism? Do you know how hard it's been to get the Home Army to even agree to disarm? They'll go ballistic! If you're going to arrest every freedom fighter in Poland, you may as well arrest this entire delegation, because I cannot think of a Polish man who did not fight the Germans! This is unacceptable, Herr Schmidt, simply unacceptable!" He roared, leaning over the table towards the German. Schmidt massaged his temples- a headache was coming on, and he doubted it would get any better until these talks finished."
speerpoland.13.a:0 "Disarmament shall suffice."
speerpoland.13.b:0 "Terrorism is terrorism."

speerpoland.14.t:0 "Status of Polish Slavery"
speerpoland.14.d:0 ""We both understand that the Fuhrer's policy on slavery is one of dismantlement, is that right?" Wachowiak spoke first this time, his voice having noticeably softened in the last hour or so. The attention of the table once again turned to him, including Schmidt's gaze.\n\n"Yes, that would be true." Schmidt responded, his eyes narrowing, a hint of Wachowiak's game beginning to form in his mind. Another bombshell, if Schmidt's intuition was true.\n\n"And these freed slaves are to be repatriated to their home nations, yes?" Wachowiak's gaze bored into Schmidt, who grew increasingly sure of where this conversation was being taken. He prepared a response in his head- this would be another headache to add to the pile.\n\n"Yes, that's the plan." Schmidt responded, steeling his voice.\n\n"Thousands of Poles still find themselves in German shackles today, Herr Schmidt, with years left before their freedom. Surely, as part of these talks, it's possible to speed their freedom, is it not?" Wachowiak's gaze never left Schmidt's eyes as he tried to think of a diplomatic response to this one.\n\n"Repatriation is a complicated business, especially when combined with-"\n\n"It's a yes-no question, Herr Schmidt." Schmidt slumped a little in his chair. This was never going to end, was it?"
speerpoland.14.a:0 "We need to stay realistic about Repatriation."
speerpoland.14.b:0 "Push for quicker Polish repatriation."

speerpoland.15.t:0 "Status of the Nuremberg Laws"
speerpoland.15.d:0 "The end of the conference was in sight, and Schmidt for one couldn't wait for it. He had known that his decisions would cause a storm of anger somewhere, no matter what he said, but he couldn't help but feel like this was going to be especially bad. His eyes, which had begun to glaze over with the endless conversation, snapped back to attention when they saw Wachowiak rise from his seat.\n\n"Now, I understand we have already touched on the topic of the Nuremberg laws-" Oh, christ, Schmidt thought. If there was something to fill his desk with angry letters, it was the Nuremberg laws."-But we have only spoken of the excessive privilege that Germans held in Poland. What we have not discussed is Polish rights- specifically, how limited they are."\n\nAs Wachowiak went through the list of limits on the Poles, Schmidt's thoughts turned inward. Once again, here was an opportunity to strike another blow at something that he had hated since the day he joined this job- the Nuremberg Laws, an outdated weight on the ankle of Germany, one that needed to be cut off. In any other case, he would not hesitate in cutting another slice into the Laws, but now? The Laws were the main legal guideline for Germany's treatment of the Poles. Such a massive change would definitely be something Speer would like to know about, and that was what was holding Schmidt back. He did not know Speer's position on the issue, and despite how much he disliked the man personally, Speer was the one who controlled his job. To go against him too much might just lead to his dismissal- something Schmidt couldn't allow to happen.\n\n"So, Herr Schmidt, I ask you-" Wachowiak finished with a flourish, leveling an accusatory finger at Schmidt's head. "-Is the Reich truly as reformist as it claims? Will you throw off the shackles that bind Poland?""
speerpoland.15.a:0 "Tone down on the Laws."
speerpoland.15.b:0 "This is too much to ask right now."

speerpoland.16.t:0 "Polish Budget"
speerpoland.16.d:0 ""Before this conference wraps up, Herr Schmidt, we have but one more topic to discuss." Wachowiak carefully pressed forth with the last topic on his paper, catching Schmidt as he was about to rise from his seat. Schmidt froze for a second, his face momentarily betraying the stress this conference had put on him, before he sat back down and gestured for Wachowiak to continue.\n\n"Besides the infrastructure built for Poland to become the Reich's logistical hub, Poland as a whole was neglected by the Reich. Our infrastructure in most places fails, our utilities are on the brink of failing, our roads are dotted with holes and cracks- we're on the brink of a disaster, Herr Schmidt. The Reich's coffers are certainly not empty- perhaps you can send some funds to our new government in order to allow us to rebuild? I promise you, such funds would be spent on infrastructure alone, nothing more."\n\nSchmidt took a deep breath in and out. Of course they were going for the wallet of the Reich now, as if they hadn't already aimed daggers at the rest of the Reich's institutions. Schmidt wasn't opposed to it himself- he just knew that it would maximise the amount of angry paperwork he'd need to sort through in the next month or two. Thoughts of a raging Speer clouded his mind- how many decisions had he already made for the Fuhrer? How many of them had been directly against his wishes?\n\nIn any case, it was the last decision to make, and then they would all shake hands and retire to their hotel rooms. Schmidt could only hope that his decisions would be acceptable to the Polish government- otherwise, this was going to be a mess for everyone involved."
speerpoland.16.a:0 "Grant them money."
speerpoland.16.b:0 "There's no point in it."

speerpoland.17.t:0 "The Treaty is Signed"
speerpoland.17.d:0 "Television crews crowded the conference room, reporters crammed themselves into every nook and cranny of the building, and the flash of cameras rattled like a machine gun. Schmidt did his best not to blink at the barrage- the last thing he needed on top of the inevitable storm he was going to catch was an unflattering image of him smeared across the front pages of every newspaper in Germany.\n\nTo his right, Wachowiak sat and smiled, looking quite pleased with himself. Schmidt couldn't blame him- he was going home a hero, having taken on the German giant and wrangled a deal that Poland could get behind out of it. Schmidt was less enthused himself- he would be going home to a storm of conservative anger and, most likely, at least one or two tense meetings with Speer. Speer hadn't said anything about the terms yet, but some of them would certainly be enough to make him tear what remained of his hair out.\n\nAnd yet, at the end of the day, Schmidt was proud of himself. He'd not only succeeded in his task, but he'd advanced his cause. Germany was on the cusp of entering a new golden age, and with Schmidt's help, he would make sure it would happen. With the treaty signed, who knew what could happen with the rest of Eastern Europe? Perhaps, soon enough, Germany could truly be first among equals in their eyes, not just a colonial overlord.\n\nAnd so, as Wachowiak put pen to paper and signed his name on the treaty, Schmidt's expression turned into a small grin as he put ink to his own."
speerpoland.17.a:0 "The new golden age is almost here."

speerpoland.18.t:0 "The Treaty Falls Apart"
speerpoland.18.d:0 "Schmidt's room was dark, illuminated only by a lamp at his desk casting a yellow glow across it. The darkness hid most of the two men's faces- Schmidt and Wachowiak. Schmidt glanced at the clock- 2 in the morning, always a good time for diplomatic meetings. "So, what's the deal, Wachowiak? We've been waiting for hours. Communication troubles?"\n\n "No, no." Wachowiak was quiet, keeping his voice low. "I've been in contact with Warsaw just fine."\n\n"So what's the issue, then? We can schedule another session-" A drop of fear struck the bottom of Schmidt's gut, a slowly rising tide of worry.\n\n"No, no, Schmidt. It's over. They've left the conference. We're to go home effective immediately. The treaty is unacceptable."\n\nSchmidt's gut shot into his throat, and he choked on his next words. This couldn't happen to him. He couldn't have failed like this. He had wrangled so many things in line, pushed so many things his way, all for nothing? Visions of his face plastered as a scapegoat and fool across every paper in Germany shot through his mind like a bullet. Oh, god, what would Speer say? He'd put all his trust behind Schmidt's idea of a peaceful reconciliation. Now that it had fallen apart, would he ever listen to Schmidt again? Would he ever even try to negotiate again? Schmidt's plans fell apart in front of him as he struggled for words, struggled for air.\n\n"Stanislaw, you can't do this to me!" he shouted, but Stanislaw was already gone, the door shutting behind him. Schmidt was left alone, with only his furious, incredulous, terrified thoughts to keep him company."
speerpoland.18.a:0 "A travesty!"

speerpoland.19.t:0 "Ending a Farce"
speerpoland.19.d:0 "The Generalgouvernement of Poland had looked like a shiny jewel to the Rest of the Reich. When revolts had erupted all over Poland, however, Hans Frank's administration was revealed for what it was: a giant castle of lies, built on foundations of bribery and falsification of public reports. Everyone had thought such an inefficient and corrupt regime would have been crushed by the rage of the Polish resistance that had been festering in Poland's purulent bureaucracy and society for decades, but instead, Frank managed to resist the onslaught, whether due to bribes, ruthless repression or simply a stroke of luck.\n\nNow, however, a new regime rules in Germania, one which can no longer tolerate such a shameful conduct. Frank will be brought in front of a court, and his administration will be disbanded in favor of one more capable of serving Germany's interests... and perhaps even Poland's, should this be in our plans. The problem is, the cur knows what awaits him once he is relieved of his office, and refuses to submit, denying our Führer's legitimate claim to the mantle of Hitler's heir.\n\nTo address this issue, Feldmarschall von Tresckow has planned a quick and decisive military action, aimed at securing Poland and bringing Frank to justice. Our troops will cross the border and disarm the security forces of the Generalgouvernement: little resistance is expected as they have little in the way of numbers and equipment, especially with the Polish resistance keeping most of them constantly overstretched. The time to end this farce has long since been due, and now is the perfect time to draw the curtain."
speerpoland.19.a:0 "Frank will pay for his crimes."

speerpoland.20.t:0 "Hans Frank Surrenders!"
speerpoland.20.d:0 "As expected, the Generalgouvernement couldn't face the military might of the Wehrmacht, crippled by the Bürgerkrieg as it may be. The garrison offered mostly a token resistance before surrendering unconditionally, and our troops quickly converged on Warsaw: there, Hans Frank was already preparing to flee the country, but his retreat towards the airport was cut by an elite commando, and he was forced to capitulate when faced with the prospect of summary execution. Within a few hours, the few loyalists still fighting either dropped their weapons or were defeated by the Heer's crushing superiority.\n\nThe Generalgouvernement has been disbanded, and replaced by a provisory military administration that will ensure a return to normalcy. Our inspectors have already scoured Frank's archives, both public and secret, finding more than enough evidence of his crimes - bribery, embezzlement, falsification of public documents, treason, the list is very long - to permanently seal his fate, but the final choice rests in Speer's hands: should he be executed for his treasonous conduct, or merely imprisoned for life? Both choices would satisfy the population, but each will appeal to one of the currents within the government."
speerpoland.20.a:0 "Frank will meet the hangman."
speerpoland.20.b:0 "Imprisonment will suffice."

 speerbohemia.1.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nThe Reich has long considered Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren to be one of the most successful Germanization projects. As you know, the purpose of the Protektorat is to pacify the local population, and, through the various means available to them, make it so that they are either phased out for ethnic Germans, or educated to the point that we can call them proper Aryans. It has mainly been the second, and it has been a great success at that. The Protektorat, then, has succeeded in its objective; I would consider it now to be a viable territory to be annexed directly into the glorious Reich. I am hopeful that you understand my reasoning for this, Herr Lutz, and that you will comply with my request, which I am certain would not come as a major difficulty for you. Your service has been valuable, and now the next step must be taken.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n - Führer Speer"

I would gladly accept entry into Germania, seeing as how my leadership of this Protektorat has led to it being established as almost entirely Germanized. There is, however, one issue that remains which both you and I must confront. There has been an issue going around-- a very strange one, at that. We both know of the SS, the cancer that manifests itself as Ordensstaat Burgund, but also as smaller tumors that spread across Europe. They have spread here, too, but fortunately the Czech Guard has, under the leadership of Rudolf Toussaint, beaten back this nest of degeneracy. For that, Rudolf has called for a special proposal to be made. For their efforts, he desires for the Czechs to immediately be recognized as honorary Aryans. My Führer, it is only with you would I have even bothered sending this proposal back to you, for you are an understanding leader. It is my hope that you can accept this compromise in order for the Protektorat to be now and forever be fully integrated into the Reich.\n\nHeil!\n\n - Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk"

 speerbohemia.3.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nI must bring you unfortunate news. The idea that the Czechs must be turned into honorary Aryans has not been received well in Germania. They may have spilt blood to protect their territory, yes, but they are subservient to the Reich first. They must learn its culture and its ways, they must learn the language, and they must learn that to become a German,  you must know what it is to be a German. Anything else would be a disapproving notion of the Germanization process. I'm certain you understand then, Herr Lutz, when I tell you that my asking of the Protektorat to become a part of the Reich is no longer a request. It is a demand. This is, unfortunately, how things must go. I will give you a period of 72 hours to respond. If you do not respond in this time, the consequences will be drastic.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n - Führer Speer"

While it may be slightly unbefitting for the Czechs to become Aryans on the spot, doing so would solve a multitude of our problems. As is the case right now, I cannot stand to comment on the actions of the Schutzstaffel in the Protektorat, but I can assure you that no foreign element will commit any sort of subversion in the territory. With this out of the way, I can congratulate your service for the Reich, Herr Lutz, and you will be rewarded generously in helping Germania expand its dominion to rightfully include all proper Germans, and honorary Aryans, into its home. That is all I shall be writing in this letter. The rest will come naturally, as we can finally say that this chapter of Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren is closed.\n\n - Führer Speer"

 speerbohemia.5.d:0 "Speer paid it little thought-- they would accept. Obviously they would. What other choice could they possibly have?! But as the minutes turned into hours turned into days, his anxiety grew and grew. There was a mild annoyance for him after the first twenty-four hours, which turned into a bothering feeling that plagued him for another twenty-four hours, and once the final day had begun, it manifested into Speer pacing in his office, waiting, just waiting, for someone to come through and hand him a note. That they would say, "My Führer, you've received a letter from Reichsprotektorat Lutz," and then bid him a crisp salute before hurrying off.\n\nBut that moment of reprieve never came. Instead, the bell had struck midnight, and Speer almost drew blood from biting in his fingertip as the last seconds of peace slipped past him. Now he had an issue to deal with. Not a big one militarily, but it would show itself to the rest of the world as a glaring hole in Mitteleuropa. If he couldn't peacefully annex one of the most integrated subjects of the Reich, what would that say for all the others?

Immense pressure has been put on me from Rudolf to continue negotiating these terms. Eventually, however, I forced his hand and he had to back down after a fierce argument we've recently had.

 speerbohemia.8.t:0 "The Madmen Over the Mountains"
 speerbohemia.8.d:0 "Speer sat around in his office, cross-legged, frustrated, looking at his desk at a stack of papers while rubbing two fingers against his forehead. He wasn't really unaware about the circumstances facing Bohemia. In fact, he was fully aware that the SS, puppets of Himmler's insanity, had planted themselves into the Protektorat and had gone so far as to openly begin clashing with the German loyalists there. He was not expecting them to win, no, even if they were expertly trained, they were outnumbered, outgunned, and they had the resistance of the local populace. But something unexpected happened.\n\nThey did win.\n\nAnd now Speer had to deal with the issue of SS Bohemia staring down the barrel of the Empire. With casualties and destruction certain to follow, the whole process was something he wasn't exactly enthusiastic about. All Speer could hope for was that the ensuing conflict would be quick and relatively bloodless.\n\nSeveral minutes later, an old man came into Speer's office, dressed in full military uniform, seemingly ready to head into combat. Speer had, obviously, recognized who this figure was. "Tresckow," he began, catching the man's attention as Speer leaned forward. "I'll make this quick. I'll be on my way to hold a speech in Vienna. While I'm gone, I'll have to ask you to organize the troops and send them to the border. You've already been briefed on the situation, so I assume you needn't ask twice about dealing with the SS."\n\nTresckow shook his head. "Regardless of the feelings I have for them, my Führer," he began, "Their resistance to entering the Reich will be met with a swift response. It's the only reasonable thing to do." The pride in his voice made Speer nod weakly, letting out a sigh as he waved his hand. "Yes, yes. I understand what you're trying to say. Now leave me be. I need to sort these papers out.""

In a minute he had gotten his uniform prepared - in another he obtained and loaded both his rifle and his sidearm, and in another he was standing shoulder to shoulder with his brothers all dressed in black. All in perfect order, as it should be, as it must be. Now he would continue to service the cause, and a gratitude of the continuation of this fact filled his mind for a moment, only for it to be just as quickly perished-- no emotion must linger too long.\n\nThe sharp cut through the air of a voice brought the soldier front and center into reality as the situation made itself clear and clarified in a moment's time. The degenerate Reich found itself trigger-happy to declare war against them for the sole purpose of being loyal to Ordenstaadt Burgund rather than the all-encompassing Empire that threatened their sovereignty. They had not earned this right, he would think, they would not step a foot in this land without proving themselves to be the low scum that they claimed to be otherwise.\n\nAnd so as the orders were barked out in meticulous order, boots marched across the floor of the barracks to prepare themselves for the eventual march outwards. He felt killing intent in his hands as he entered an armory designated for machine-gunners, and as he laid eyes upon a buzzsaw that would cut through rotten Aryan blood like a scythe through a field."

 speerbohemia.10.t:0 "To Prevent Terror"
 speerbohemia.10.d:0 "Vienna was empty that day. Or, at least, it was cleared out of citizens. Considering the enemy the Reich was about to take on, it wasn't sure just what exactly this SS force was capable of, even if everyone assumed that they would be quickly crushed. Either way, Speer had paved way to make a speech, just as he had said before to Tresckow, who seemed to have sortied the army efficiently to the borders. Now he had to rile up the troops to fight their own. Not too difficult, he hoped, considering that who they were fighting was, well...\n\n"Soldiers of the Reich!" He began, "There is a festering abomination just beyond these borders. I am unwilling to name the beast that wanders from land to land, spreading an ideology that only serves to corrupt and destroy the lands and men it touches!" A resounding agreement came from the soldiers. They knew of the Black State and its disgusting off-branch of "supremacy" that amounted to nothing but insanity. "That is why I implore you, as citizens of Germany, to see this threat in the Protektorat as an obstacle to unification and nothing more! The SS there will be quashed under our jackboot, and no mercy will be given to its adherents. Strike hard, quickly, and annihilate them!"\n\nSpeer could see it, clearly, that these men listening to him regarded the SS as more ideological foes of the Reich than a beast in the making. Whatever justification to butcher these vermin would be, it didn't matter to him, so long as the influence of Himmler was contained to his feudal playground and nothing more."
 speerbohemia.10.a:0 "The Protektorat shall join us soon enough."

 speerbohemia.11.t:0 "Marching on Prague"
 speerbohemia.11.d:0 "Noise - that's what it was. So much noise had polluted the city when the war began. From the SS moving in and doing what the SS does, ranging from executing those who refused to fully cooperate with them to immediately beginning preparations of turning the city into a death trap. They did not have much time on their hands, owing it to the fact that the forces of the Reich, gutless as they were, still fought on the cult of speed and combined arms. And so it was that when they finally arrived, trucks chugging into highways, planes dotting the sky, and boots stomping against gravel, did the SS spring their trap. Explosions rocked one street corner after another, filling entire sections of Prague with dust and smog, while gunfire rained down from above barred apartments and abandoned shops.\n\nThe fighting was grueling, to say the least. Every inch the Heer took, the agents of Himmler would make sure that it was paid dearly, either in blood spilled or buildings laying themselves bare and crippled after the SS exhausted their defensive capability. It was before the sun had fully set, nearing the edge of darkness, when Prague found a vague semblance of peace overtake the majority of the city. The destruction had not been severe enough to warrant a crisis, but a rebuilding program would need to be begun, and many heartfelt letters were sorely needed back in the homeland. Even still, the menace was driven out of the capital, which proved an effective end to the terror plaguing the Protektorate."

 ## Danish Events ##
 speerdenmark.1.t:0 "Approaching the Danes"
 speerdenmark.1.d:0 "Speer had always found it a little annoying, if he was to be openly honest about it, that this small nation of not much significance stood tall above the Reich, retaining its full independence and colours on any map printed out. Not only could they be easily swayed to join the Pakt, but he could make a strong case on why they would only benefit such a thing, being close Aryan brothers and having no real land disagreements. The idea would be twofold. First, Speer would offer the Danish government a small helping hand upon entering the Pakt, so they could ease themselves in and be comfortable amid the rest of the Reich's allies. Secondly, he would hold a speech that would be televised to viewers home and abroad, where he would testify to the strength of the Reich and the solitary situation the Danish found themselves, which, if they accepted the help of their Aryan brothers below, is something that would be easily rectified. Now all that remained was to begin planning."
 speerdenmark.1.a:0 "They will return home."

 speerdenmark.2.t:0 "The Carrot and the Stick"
 speerdenmark.2.d:0 "There was nothing particularly outstanding about Denmark, he thought, once Speer had looked over the economic analysis of the country. Nothing at all that really made it especially valuable besides being another source for manpower and labor to feed into the Reich. That wasn't the concern here, however, even if Speer considered the Danes to be easy candidates for Germanization. They were to become allies first, and anything else would come afterwards.\n\nA short and direct economic plan was drafted up, which would give the Danes small, temporary privileges upon entering the Reich. This would take up a small portion of the Reich's budget, and perhaps annoy the other subjects of the Pakt slightly for favoring them like this, but continuing to consecrate rule across Europa would only benefit everyone involved."
 speerdenmark.2.a:0 "Now onto the next step."

 speerdenmark.3.t:0 "They're Nothing Without Us"
 speerdenmark.3.d:0 "Speer couldn't understand how some men could hold speeches that lasted for so long about such trivial things. This, chiefly, was one of those trivial things. He was already so close in convincing them to join that he was almost visibly annoyed with dragging it out with the Danes by the time he had to begin to address the people listening.\n\nThere was a short interlude whereupon a presenter introduced the many titles of the Führer, inciting roaring applause from the audience that was present, before the man nodded towards Speer as he let him take the stand.\n\n"To the people of Denmark, listen to what I have to say next. I wish to call upon you a simple fact - a statement that cannot be ignored, an issue that cannot be resolved, a bothersome idea that trails behind your every footstep." Speer took a deep breath\n\n"You are alone. In this reshaping of the New World Order, you are alone."\n\n"All of your troubles, your loneliness, your vulnerability, this will leave you only as prey for greater powers willing to ruin you, bring you down into the sinking depths of history. But we are your Germanic brothers. We are your neighbours, the ones from across the river that shall bid you a warm greeting. We, the men of the Reich, are here for you. Like a man fumbling in the raging river, drowning and calling for help, we will come to you and lend you a hand. And with a mighty Germanic grip, we will pull you out, to the safety of the world, and we will call you a friend of ours."\n\n"Come, Denmark, for the thousand-year Reich shall soar with the rest of Europa on its wings."
 speerdenmark.3.a:0 "I see how they hold speeches about trivial things, now."

 speerdenmark.4.t:0 "Welcome Home"
 speerdenmark.4.d:0 "Speer let out a sigh of relief. What else was he expecting to happen, really? Considering the geopolitical position of the Danes, there really was only one option left for them to take. The other would leave them stranded and alone, ripe for the taking. As he silently read the letter through in his office, a small, satisfied smile came to his lips. They had agreed, and over the course of the next month, Denmark would begin its entry into the Pakt. Seems like his Germanic rhetoric had worked after all, and the money boost certainly convinced the more pragmatic-minded Danes in their cabinet. The economy of the Reichspakt would see a small, but noticeable, increase in its wealth, and the maps of Europa printed out in the future could finally shade that small blotch of land in as belonging to the Reich's sphere of influence."
 speerdenmark.4.a:0 "With this taken care of, Speer turns to other issues."

 speerdenmark.5.t:0 "The Extremists to the North"
 speerdenmark.5.d:0 "Damnation! While this wasn't the worst case scenario, it certainly came close to it. With the Hardliners now having a stranglehold on Denmark, there would certainly be no way to introduce them into the Pakt, seeing Speer's position as Führer to be a betrayal of their original values. Whatever they were planning, they had to be stopped and quickly brought under the wing of the Reich. Which is why he had to call for a certain... someone.\n\n"My Führer- it is a pleasure that I have been called to your office," the man in front of Speer spoke, standing tall and straight with a smile on his face. He put a hand out, and they both shook strongly before letting go. "I have a feeling you already know what I am about to tell you, Herr Reinhardt," Speer spoke, turning around and taking a few steps forwards to his desk. "I suppose I do, my Führer. This concerns Denmark, doesn't it?" The spymaster spoke, which confirmed Speer's suspicions. He didn't need to respond as his compatriot continued. "I will not speak on the topic of the ideology that has overtaken their government, but I can assure you that this will be an unusual operation." Speer could tell that Reinhardt was hiding something. Distaste, maybe? It didn't matter to him - they were National Socialists that would not compromise, and thus a threat to be destroyed.\n\n"There are already agents in place. What would you like me to do with them?" The response was obvious, but he wanted Speer to announce it for him. "Set them up for a coup. Your men... this operation will be risky, and if they're caught, they will likely face trial for their crimes. Anything less than treason against the state followed by execution would be a miracle." Reinhardt sighed, but did nothing more. The Führer could tell that the spymaster was getting impatient, and so he turned to face the man with a dismissive hand wave. "You are free to go. This operation is effective immediately."
 speerdenmark.5.a:0 "There will be no compromise with the Danish."

 speerdenmark.6.t:0 "Men on the Inside"
 speerdenmark.6.d:0 "The radio on the man's desk crackled to life as he approached it, and, sitting down, placed the headphones on his head. The shot of static made him flinch slightly, but the voice that followed afterwards gave him a smile."\n\n"Frederick, my friend!" He greeted boisterously, prompting the radio operator to turn down the volume. "Hah - how have you been, serving the Reich yonder over the border? I've just been spending my time walking around Copenhagen, following patrols and armored vehicles and taking pictures of them. It's not hard work, no, but I assume you've called me for a change of plans, eh?" He said, ending it with a short laugh.\n\nFrederick sighed softly. Could he let the man speak? It's almost as if he wasn't needed here. "Yes, Johann, I know what you've been doing recently-- it's my job to keep track of the agents in Denmark. At least, some of them, and that includes you." The static crackled back in with another bout of laughter. "That's the fighting spirit," Wilhelm commented. "Look, I've been seeing someone muck about in a pastry shop I've been frequenting recently. They seem sort of kept to themselves, but I can spot a proper Aryan when I see one! So tell me, Frederick, is that who I'm--"\n\n"Yes, yes it is." The dull, almost defeated voice cut in. "It's good that you're serving the Reich, and not the Danish. Look, if Headquarters is hearing in on this, they will have my neck. We are supposed to be disciplined, so I will give you your orders. Are you listening carefully?"\n\nSilence followed for several seconds afterwards.\n\n"Right then. That man you mentioned... you are to meet him, yes. His name is Oscar Blecher. Greet him with the phrase 'I wish to buy you a Lager, my friend', and he will recognize you right away as a man of the Reich. From then onwards, you are to follow his instructions. Is this clear?"\n\nAgain, silence dominated the radio frequency for a few seconds before Wilhelm spoke up, voice having now sombered up. "Yes, Bordfunker Frederick. I can assume, then, that this is where the operation will begin?", "That is the case. If you succeed, we will be able to topple the SS without having to fire a single shot. If not, then-", "Then nothing!" Wilhelm cut in joyously. "Don't worry about what will or will not happen. I hold no ill will towards the National Socialists here - but they stand in the way of the Reich. In toppling this resistance, I will be doing a service to the Führer. You have other things to tend to, my friend, and I hope to see you again. Now... goodbye, Bordfunker Frederick."
 speerdenmark.6.a:0 "Goodbye, Herr Wilhelm."

 speerdenmark.7.t:0 "Subverting Their Will"
 speerdenmark.7.d:0 "Frederick's pistol fit snugly in his coat as he felt the groove of the barrel while walking through the streets of Copenhagen. He dressed in civilian clothing, naturally, though made sure to wear thick enough clothing to conceal the weapon he was carrying with him. As he looked upon a small band of armed soldiers walking across a narrow street, he stopped up for a moment, glancing at the rifles in their hands for a moment before swiftly turning his head away. He hoped, he thought, he well and truly hoped that he didn't stand out as an oddity in these empty streets as he took the opportunity to scan his surroundings once more. Seeing now that there were no soldiers in this small section of Copenhagen, he dashed into a nearby alleyway, footsteps pounding against concrete that softened into blades of grass and dirt.\n\n"Herr... Frederick?" A voice called out in the darkness. He could recognize who it was. Or, rather, who they were. "I'm glad you recognized me. Was it my hair?" The sarcasm in his voice was annoyingly audible as a gang of three showed themselves. All three of them seemed heavily armed though lightly armored, carrying molotovs, grenades, each with a set of pistols, and one of them having a submachine gun. "No, Herr Reinhardt," spoke the one with the largest weapon, a heavy Danish accent tinting his German. "Nobody would willingly go into this alleyway alone."\n\nHe rolled his eyes. "Of course they wouldn't! I was only making a joke! I..." Reinhardt rolled his eyes. "Well, all humor aside, I suppose you gentlemen are here to parley with me. I know we are not friends, certainly, but I am under the orders of my Führer to help your resistance activities. I believe you will find my expertise to be most... exciting, if I may say."\n\n"Yeah?" One of them chimed in. "And you have to offer us what exactly?" The German chuckled heartily. "I am not a man of firearms."
 speerdenmark.7.a:0 "But if you give me a grenade or two, I can show you a trick."

 speerdenmark.8.t:0 "The Coup Begins"
 speerdenmark.8.d:0 "He swore he could feel his entire body shaking from that one. Well - it didn't matter now, did it?\n\n"Herr Frederick, if I may be so curious as to ask," came the voice of a man that was nearly drowned out by gunfire, "did the bastard Aryans hire you because they saw your potential, or because you bombed the nearest barr-" In speaking of bombs, two pairs of eyes spotted something distinctly hand-grenade-shaped coming their way, with both men giving all their strength to jump the hell away from where it would land. Frederick managed to get himself behind an empty oil barrel, while his other friend, who he came to know as Albert, took cover behind a shot-up, deflated truck. The German could tell when the explosion came when he felt a lack of noise and a presence of ringing in his ears both occurring at the same time, which he took as an opportunity to dust himself off and grip the pistol in his hand properly, turning back around and meeting up with Albert once again.\n\n"All of this just for our country to be handed over to the bloody Aryan," the other man spit out, glaring fiercely. "Shedding the blood of my countrymen... I thought I would be doing this for democracy." Frederick grinned. "Look at it this way, my Danish friend- we coup your country, we install a vague semblance of democracy. You enter the Pakt, you prosper from it. It's so simple, I hardly doubt anyone would say no to it." Albert audibly grumbled at that last part, only being stopped from speaking by being forced to duck his head under a shower of gunfire.\n\nThe conversation stopped for a few seconds to let the noise calm down enough for someone to actually be audible. "I hate this," Albert growled. "Don't look at me like that!" Frederick responded with fake concern. "Come on...""
 speerdenmark.8.a:0 "At least we're getting rid of the Hardliners for you."

 speerdenmark.9.t:0 "The Coup Fails"
 speerdenmark.9.d:0 "Frederick finally found himself some peace and quiet. In this abandoned-out building, he could rest for just a little bit. As he entered a room, he noticed that there was an abandoned sniper sitting perched up on a window, obviously aiming outside. His eyes widened and also shined when he spotted the weapon, even letting out a small 'ooh' as he approached it. Examining it carefully, he could see what it was. And the results were outstanding - it was a vintage weapon! Even more than that, it was a modified vintage weapon. The Karabiner 98 kurz with a scope mounted on top. Frederick was no marksman, but if this plan went successfully, then he could perhaps take this and keep it for himself as a reward for his service when he returned home. Though, he hadn't heard from his allies outside in a while, he was certain that everything would go alright.\n\nThat was, until he heard the soft sound of footsteps behind him. Frederick froze in place; he recognized the distance immediately, and it was not one that he would risk turning around for. Instead, he opted to slowly raise his arms up in the air, closing his eyes for a short while and taking a deep breath. The voice that came afterwards he only understood in fragments, but he didn't have to translate it. "German," he said, "I am a German. I don't understand Danish," he continued, and there was nothing in response for a second or two afterwards, which made the anxiety in his stomach grow heavier. Then, he heard a sigh, and another pair of footsteps. "You are coming with me, Aryan." It was slow, broken up and paced awkwardly, but it would make do. "Trial for treason."\n\nFrederick bit his lower lip. What the hell was he to do now except hand himself over? There was something, at least - a question that burned in his mind that he wanted answered before the inevitable came. "What has happened to the others outside?" A quick, cruel laughter came to meet his question. "Idiotic Aryan. Is it not clear?""
 speerdenmark.9.a:0 "You have failed your mission. Now, come, with the rest of the scum."

 speerdenmark.10.t:0 "Formalizing The Ultimatum"
 speerdenmark.10.d:0 ""To the people of Denmark..."\n\nSpeer crossed one leg over the other and stared at the typewriter. How was he going to formulate this... ? "The situation has turned dire."  He was to emphasize the danger the Danes were putting themselves in. Something about how the mistake they have made was grave, but in a way that showed strength, not desperation. "The Reich is unafraid to show why it is the Master of Europa." That would certainly catch their attention. Furthermore, he had to showcase that there is no degeneracy plaguing Germania. After all, if he wanted them to join the Pakt as well, he wanted to get them on their good side. And so...\n\n"... Ever since our magnificent victory so long ago, we have established a Reich that would last for generations to come. This is unprecedented in history. The empires of old - the Achaemenids, the Romans, the Francians, the British, they all share one fatal flaw in common. They relied on the strength of their arms, not on the strength of their people. We, however, are unified in our cause. It is, therefore, imperative that your people understand their position."\n\nHere Speer took a gamble.\n\n"The Reich's strength is unparalleled, its discipline unrivalled, and we do not wish to bring the full might of the Wehrmacht upon your nation. It would only bring ruin. Instead, we demand that you do two things. First, you will release every man related to the attempted coup in Copenhagen. They will be guaranteed safety, whether German or Danish, from any acts of violence against them. Secondly, the nation of Denmark will enter the Reichspakt, and will be treated as any regular member. Your opportunity to join as a special member has passed. Now there is only one choice to be made.""
 speerdenmark.10.a:0 "For the Danish Volk, I hope you make the correct choice."

 speerdenmark.11.t:0 "Denmark Refuses"
 speerdenmark.11.d:0 "Frederick was restrained from head to toe - not only did he have cuffs on, he also had a see-through bag on his head. Really, he thought, this was absurd. Admittedly he had only seen one trial in-person, and that was for a theft of goods in his hometown. The court wasn't nearly as grand as this, and nor was the judge as loud as the one he heard beforehand. He could barely understand what he was hearing, either, but the sinking feeling he had would tell him everything he needed to know. Here and there, while uncomfortably shuffling in his seat, he could hear the judge yelling out words like 'treason', 'betrayal', 'court', and probably a couple of swears here and there. The lump in his throat grew bigger as time passed, and a few questions were wandering his mind. Mainly, how long this whole charade would take. He thankfully had no family to worry about when he would eventually be dug into a ditch, but still, the idea of execution did not sound nice to him.\n\nThe slam of a gavel rang in his ears after two entire hours passed, and Frederick let out a breath he didn't realize he was keeping in for so long. Being roughly picked up by two guards, he felt a tremor go down his back. Shit - this was really happening, wasn't it? He was about to be brought out to the back to be executed like a dog, by people whose ideology he could share common ground with. A National Socialist executing another National Socialist. Frederick could only muster a shaky grin to himself as he closed his eyes, sending out a prayer to whatever deity was watching that some freak accident would happen.\n\nHe grunted when his body hit the dirt, and grit his teeth when he gave a single attempt at trying to break free of his restraints. There was too much ringing in his mind to hear whatever the hell was going outside of the confines of the bag on his head, and his uneven breaths bothered him. What did he say before? That he was an agent of the Reich? That he would lay his life down on the line? Well, now he was, in the most literal sense possible. Frederick found that a bit ironic, actually. So ironic that his lips parted as teeth bared themselves.\n\nToo bad he never got the time to let out a chuckle."
 speerdenmark.11.a:0 "It seems that the Danish have denied the ultimatum."

 speerdenmark.12.t:0 "Denmark Accepts"
 speerdenmark.12.d:0 "Frederick felt groggy in this cell. Perhaps it was the significantly different change of pace that he was used to. Perhaps it was the fact that he was stripped of all his pride down to prisoner's clothing. And it might just be the fact that he was about to get sent to his death. Who knows? Frederick sure as hell didn't, stuck in here and unavailable to hear news to the rest of the world. By the time the next morning came, he felt hungry, thirsty, and sure as hell annoyed. He knew how this trial would conclude, so what was taking them so long?!\n\nThe answer came in the form of a knock on his cell that caught his attention. "Herr Frederick," the man in the uniform said, drawing each syllable out. "Yes, what is it? Am I finally getting the bullet? Or am I reaching the chamber first before that happens?" He sarcastically bit back, standing up to his feet and staring at what looked like to be his jailor. "No, Herr Frederick. You are getting released.", "What?", "You heard me correctly. You are being released. Do I have to repeat this to you again?"\n\n"No... you don't." He wasn't willing to admit it openly, but a massive weight was lifted from his shoulders when he heard that he wasn't about to go six feet under. "Why, however?" The jailor stared at him with a mixture of boredom and disgust. "Your Führer has, to put it bluntly, threatened to invade our nation if we did not release you all and join your Pakt." He could almost feel the sneering expression from here. "I hope you are happy. Now," he began, plugging a key into the entrance. "Get out." He finished, emphasizing it with a click as the door opened. With a massive grin that was quickly tempered by his want to not get beaten up by the guard, Frederick walked out feeling like a new man. Though, something crossed his mind when he took the first step beyond bars."
 speerdenmark.12.a:0 "Can I get to keep that Karabiner I found... ?"

 speerdenmark.13.t:0 "The Coup Succeeds"
 speerdenmark.13.d:0 "Being in full uniform while laying down in an apartment bed was uncomfortable, Frederick noted. It was especially uncomfortable when he made the unwise decision of dragging cigarette smoke out of his mouth, resulting in a quick coughing fit as he struggled to sit up straight. Even after participating in open rebellion, nearly getting a bullet lodged into his brain, and explosions rocking him so hard he's likely going to lose his hearing by the time he was in his sixties, the German almost succumbed on the spot to one stupid decision. "The things that happen in life," he coughed out, mumbling to himself while he stared down at the wooden floor below. "That wouldn't have gotten me any medal of honor. Now where the hell-"\n\nThe banging on the door riddled with bullet holes made him jump in fright, reaching for his pistol and only stopping when he heard his native tongue being spoken. "Herr Frederick?" The voice called out. "Your car has arrived. I would suggest leaving immediately, as it would be best if we don't risk some rogue agent shooting up your vehicle." That made him crack a smile as he got up. He still kept the pistol at his side, however, just to be on the safe side. "I hope the Danes are not terrified of me when I step out.", "No, they-- Come on, Herr Frederick, if you want to be applauded for your efforts, you'll have time for it during the trip back to Germania.", "Fine, fine."\n\nDriving through the streets of Copenhagen now, once the violence had settled, felt strange to him. Surrounding the center of the city, Frederick could see clearly the aftereffects of what happened. Bloodied and burnt bodies with emptied-out weapons would be a common sight, with some places being warzones that he himself had to pass through. "So then, once I come home I believe I can safely say that I will be duly rewarded for my efforts," Frederick proudly spoke, staring out the car window while he talked. "The Führer will be most pleased to hear this news, after all, and I could see myself earning a raise in pay. Hmm... the possibilities." He turned to the driver who kept his focus narrow on the road. "Hey, what do you think will happen when I come home? Maybe they'll let me keep a souvenir gun at home? Ooh, I love bolt-action rifles. The noise they make when they shoot is so satisfying, and the click of the bolt...""
 speerdenmark.13.a:0 "The road back was long and arduous. Except for Frederick."

 ## Holland Events
 speerholland.1.t:0 "Meeting with the Dutch"
 speerholland.1.desc:0 "There is much reason for Germany to rejoice, with the civil war over, and the heart of the Reich secured under the banner of its new leader, Albert Speer. For the reunification of the Volk, however, there remain many battles still to be won. The Germanic people of Europe are divided, scattered across the continent, a stark contrast to Hitler's grand alliance system, and a definite liability to the new regime in Germania. To the West, Germany's brothers in Holland have yet to rejoin the Pakt, leaving both the Vaterland and the Netherlands in a precarious position.\n\nFor the new Führer and Foreign Minister Schmidt, reentry of Holland has become a diplomatic priority, and negotiations with [HOL.GetLeader] and the rest of the Hague are being planned. Within Speer's cabinet, there is much uncertainty about the coming meeting, but on the outside, Germany's head of state is all smiles and waves for the people. He reaffirmed this confidence to the public before he and his plane departed from Germania, ensuring the Völkischer Beobachter a quote for their headline:\n\n"The Dutch know where their blood belongs.""
 speerholland.1.a:0 "Gute Reise, mein Führer!"

 speerholland.2.t:0 "Germanic Brotherhood"
 speerholland.2.desc:0 "Was he certain once? He was certain he wasn't now. Decades under the doctrine of any belief can push the faith of any man, especially the smart ones, and, if anything, Speer certainly considered himself clever.\n\nIt was precisely this intelligence which commanded Speer to appeal to the Dutch reactionaries through race in his negotiations. In a speech to a collection of statesmen in the political capital of the Netherlands, the Führer connected the philosophical genius of the Dutch Descartes and Voetius, with the German Leibniz and Goethe. He connected the diplomatic centrality of the Hague with Bismarck's focus on alliances and peace. Both nations, Speer went on, shared a common history of honourable monarchies and fair republics, feudal states and global empires. Truly, there was a unique and profound link, at the level of blood, that connected the Dutch and the Germans in a genetic brotherhood. At this conclusion, a raucous applause erupted from the gathered crowd in the Binnenhof.\n\nSpeer wasn't certain about the Jews, but he was certain that Europe did have an inferior subhuman infesting it. The proud Aryans of Speer's homeland clung onto every word of Germanic superiority that emerged from their Führer's mouth. A million conservative ears, from Amsterdam to Danzig, fixated on his voice in their radios and television sets. Like pigs, the true untermenschen of the Reich lapped up Speer's lies."
 speerholland.2.a:0 "We're Brothers in Race"

 speerholland.3.t:0 "Wooing the Dutch"
 speerholland.3.desc:0 "It was in his negotiations that Speer realised he had underestimated the Dutch. Dealing with a nation built on foundational traditions of economic, diplomatic and trading expertise was not, he discovered, a walk in the park. To woo the Dutch, Speer (after some amount of stern lecturing and heated argumentation originating from one Ludwig Erhard) elected to offer them economic subsidies. Instead of the immediate acceptance he had hoped for, the German Führer was met with the smiling faces of the Dutch ministry, reliably followed by Erhard sending Speer a responsive glare. They demanded more. Much more.\n\nSpeer was faced with a decision. He could cave and hand the Dutch their favoured subsidies, which would curry favour in the Hague and guarantee them joining the Pakt, but harm both Germany's treasury and the Führer's legitimacy. On the other hand, Speer could refuse, try to call the Hague's bluff, while maintaining his image and his resources, but reducing the potential sympathies of the Netherlands for the Pakt, and certainly alienating Germany from Holland's favour"
 speerholland.3.a:0 "Accept their demands, pay the full subsidies."
 speerholland.3.b:0 "Call their bluff, make it clear what we're willing to give."

 speerholland.4.t:0 "An Agreement Reached"
 speerholland.4.desc:0 "Stern gazes and tight handshakes in the Hague today, as the Führer and the Netherlands have finally come to a compromise surrounding the matter of subsidies. Formalities abound, with [HOL.GetLeader] and Speer engaging in all the manners of true Germanic statesmen. An image of the two is to cover the front page of the Völkischer Beobachter, the leaders smiling, their arms around each other. It will make for a good headline and an excellent symbol for the renewed unity of the nations.\n\nThese are just the necessary appearances, however; neither the Dutch nor the Germans are entirely pleased with the outcome. In any event, with an imperfect agreement reached, the negotiations are almost ready to conclude..."
 speerholland.4.a:0 "Politics is not an exact science."

 speerholland.5.t:0 "They Always Want More..."
 speerholland.5.desc:0 "Word from the Hague is that the Führer's scheme has failed. Outwitting the Dutch proved too much for Germania's new cabinet, and on top of this, Holland has demanded more than their initial subsidy request. With Erhard fuming, it looks like there is no choice for Speer but to concede defeat and agree with the new demands. The Netherlands are guaranteed to return into the fold once more, but at the loss of Germany's dignity, the treasury's wallet, and the Führer's eardrums, once Erhard is through with them."
 speerholland.5.a:0 "Gott verdammt!"

 speerholland.6.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
 speerholland.6.desc:0 "After a long, and not in the slightest easy process, Holland has reentered the Pakt. Ceremonies are being held in Germania, the Hague, Amsterdam, and elsewhere across the two nations. The papers are decorated with messages of Aryan brotherhood, while the streets are adorned with the twin banners of the Prinsenvlag and the Swastika, flailing together in the wind.\n\nHolland and the Reich are now themselves flailing together in the wind. In a hostile world still haunted by Hitler's ghost, one more ally for the new Reich is far from taken for granted by the Führer. This new development has not saved him from the punishment of returning home, however. Erhard has developed quite the list of criticisms for the Führer's handling of the subsidy situation, with the plane from the Hague to Germania providing just enough time to go through them. Unlike his economic counterpart, Schmidt has little say on the matter for now.\n\nSpeer is scarcely paying attention to either. As the plane lifts off Dutch soil, the Führer stares out over the cityscape as it fades into the countryside. The old man sighs. One more nation, he thinks."
 speerholland.6.a:0 "Heims in Reich."

 speerholland.7.t:0 "The Madmen to the West"
 speerholland.7.desc:0 "In the absence of Germania's oversight, the Dutch have fallen into a particularly vile mode of governmental insanity. The Schutzstaffel have seized control of Holland, and have begun emulating the program of their brethren in Burgundy. In place of the old Reichkomissariat, the Himmlerite system has spread to cover the whole of the Low Countries. Speer was no thrall to the Nazi doctrine of the German heartland, and had moments of sincere doubt about the party's racial ideology. There was no doubt, however, that whatever the faults of the Reich, the wholesale slaughter and enslavement of good Germanic men and women being committed by the new Dutch regime were crimes of a uniquely wicked breed. \n\nKiesinger and Speer talk quietly with each other just outside the Reichstag's main hall. They are facing away from the rest of the cabinet, pointing and muttering about a piece of paper the Führer is gripping. His speech. The two old men exchange a glance of reassurance, before Kiesinger gives his leader a pat on the back, and follows Speer out in front of the crowd. \n\nSpeer took pride in the Volkshalle. It was a magnificent building, and the Führer considered it as much a symbol of his own expertise as the purported Volk it symbolised. He gazed out at the hundreds of faces that comprised the reichstag, placing his speech on the podium before him.\n\n"In our time of crisis," he began, "it seems our enemies have taken advantage of Germany's distracted might. The madmen to the West spread their tendrils, and if this cancer is left unchecked, it will form a malignant growth, the type that would fell lesser nations. We are not, however, a lesser nation. The German people will not fall silent while our brothers and sisters are murdered in Holland. As I speak, our brave Wehrmacht is moving across the Dutch border, and we will not halt until the Reich's flag flies over Amsterdam."
 speerholland.7.a:0 "And the gears of war will turn once more..."

 speerholland.8.t:0 "We've Got Work To Do"
 speerholland.8.desc:0 "Speer had promised a war and a war he had won. Like the Romans of old, Speer enjoys some form of a triumphal parade in Germania, as the citizens of his Reich celebrate victory over Holland. Speer was a reformist, perhaps, but that did not mean he could not appreciate the finer pleasures of a Führer.\n\nFor Speer, this celebration was momentary. The Reich now occupied foreign territory, but could not retain military oversight forever. The Dutch would have their nation back, reintegrated into the Pakt, and with a stronger bond to Germania than before. The Chancellery, the Volkshalle and the Hague are now moving in sync with unity of purpose. The long march to civilian rule in the Netherlands has begun."
 speerholland.8.a:0 "Nous Maintiendrons"

 speerholland.9.t:0 "A Propaganda Campaign"
 speerholland.9.desc:0 "Speer tapped his pen against his closed mouth, alone in the Chancellery office. The Führer's brow is furrowed. Holland is back in the Reich, yes, and the various ministries and state apparatus of Germany are working day-in-day-out in the reconstitution of the Netherlands. The land of the Dutch has been seized, but Speer knows that their hearts and minds are yet to be won. The Spartan ideology clouds their thoughts, and after any stint of SS rule, the citizenry may feel that their loyalties lie more in Ost-Paris than Germania.\n\nSpeer picks up the phone, and dials for Kiesinger. The tone fades into the Deputy Führer's familiar silvery tones. Speer speaks. "Kurt, I need you to rally some support in the Volkshalle. I want a propaganda campaign in Holland, in support of our government of course. Yes, posters, radio broadcasts, television shows, just get whatever you can get from the good folks in the party. You can do that? Thank you Kurt. Take care."\n\nThe Führer puts the phone down, and gazes out onto the Chancellery lawn."
 speerholland.9.a:0 "Peace is hell."

 speerholland.10.t:0 "Finding the Perfect Leadership"
 speerholland.10.desc:0 "The reports coming in from the Hague look promising. Holland's citizenry are giving growing approval in surveys across the country, notably a growing enthusiasm for the conduct of the Unity Pakt and confidence in the Netherlands' place inside it. The Volkshalle, of course, can barely contain its enthusiasm at the news. It seems that the propaganda campaign was a glowing success.\n\nRumour round the informed circles of Germania is that Schmidt and Speer are to meet in the Chancellery this afternoon. With the prospects looking better, the foreign minister and the Führer will be discussing who to nominate for leadership of the newly reintegrated low countries."
 speerholland.10.a:0 "How exciting!"

 speerholland.11.t:0 "A Return to Civilian Rule"
 speerholland.11.desc:0 "Even amongst the rough humanity presented by the Nazi party, Speer can always find a way. It was not just him, to be fair. The perfect leadership for Holland would not have been found without the help of Kiesinger and Schmidt, sure. Speer knew, however, that his vision had paved the way, and now with good men loyal to the Reich moving toward the Hague, Germania was one step closer towards its former glory.\n\nIn Holland, civilian government is slowly but surely being returned. The propaganda campaign and the leadership team have proved themselves remarkably. Now, as the military administration is dismantled, all traces of the SS have been removed. An operation successful, if the Führer did say so himself."
 speerholland.11.a:0 "Even Erhard can't deny that"

 speerslovakia.1.t:0 "Gateway to the Balkans"
 speerslovakia.1.d:0 "To the South of Germany, bordering our territories in Schlesien and Mähren, lie the Carpathian Mountains. This great wall of rock caged the newly unified Hungary in the 9th Century, and before that had been the barrier that even the great Romans could not reach before being halted in their Eastern expansion. It is a bulwark, and a blight on our influence in the Balkans, and beyond.\n\nThere is a solution here, albeit a simple one. Winning over Slovakia would bypass the Carpathians and give the Reich a wider border with Hungary. Additionally, the reintegration of Slovakia into the Pakt would regain Germany an old ally, increasing our legitimacy in the eyes of both the public, and abroad. Considering this, Speer has sent an ultimatum to Bratislava; rejoin the Pakt or face invasion."
 speerslovakia.1.a:0 "Seems an obvious choice."
 
 speerslovakia.2.t:0 "An Ultimatum from the North"
 speerslovakia.2.d:0 "Slovakia has received an envoy from the German foreign ministry; they are demanding that we either rejoin their Unity-Pakt or accept invasion. A damning choice if ever there was one.\n\nOn the one hand, we have little choice, with the German Heer far outweighing our own standing army and our extensive border with them allowing a swift invasion on their part. On the other, we would essentially be forfeiting much of our international sovereignty, both economic and political, and our population might not see eye to eye with us on choosing Germania's path."
 speerslovakia.2.a:0 "Cave to the beast. Better bloodless servitude than futile war."
 speerslovakia.2.b:0 "Deny the demands. We won't go down without a fight."

 speerslovakia.3.t:0 "Bratislava Agrees"
 speerslovakia.3.d:0 "Success! Our diplomats have returned to Germania with good news; Slovakia intends on rejoining the Pakt and the Zollverein peacefully. With our old ally reintegrated, a new section of our border has been secured, and our foreign policy can begin wandering elsewhere."
 speerslovakia.3.a:0 "Heims in Reich!"
 
 speerslovakia.4.t:0 "Bratislava Refuses"
 speerslovakia.4.d:0 "The fools in Slovakia have gone against Germania's gracious offer. Our diplomats have returned to Germania empty-handed; Slovakia intends on defying the Reich.

 ###Ostland events###
 speer.900.t:0 "The Rank And File"
 speer.900.d:0 "Ostland is secured once again, and even now our men began the arduous task of restoring order to the war-torn region. The new regime that has been put in place is already reporting record numbers of enemy combatants- either surrendering, engaging our forces, or being caught fleeing the country. Most importantly, however, is the question of what we do with the captured soldiers.\n\nThese men- soldiers who fought under the regime of Otto-Heinrich Drechsler- are predominantly lower-ranking officers, such as lieutenants and sergeants. However, these men have committed treason- a crime punishable with anything up to death. To try them as traitors would certainly drive our point home and shore up our positions, but would also deprive the Heer of experienced, loyal soldiers. Meanwhile, pardoning these men would weaken our case and benefit the reactionaries, but these men would certainly be useful within our ranks. The decision falls to Albert Speer."
 speer.900.a:0 "Pardon them. They're not the men responsible."
 speer.900.b:0 "No mercy for traitors."

 speer.901.t:0 "An Ally In The East?"
 speer.901.d:0 ""Meyer-Landrut won? Interesting." Speer rubbed his jaw in contemplation. \n\n"Indeed. While of course I'd hoped for this outcome I hadn't expected it. He's maintained that you were the best choice as Führer since his uprising began. No doubt he'll be eager to rejoin the Reich." \n\n"No doubt." \n\nSchmidt had expected more - wasn't Speer pleased? "With your permission I will send him an invitation to Germania. I'll handle the negotiations for Ostland's handover personally." \n\n"Yes... and no. I want to meet him myself, get the measure of the man." Another surprise."
 speer.901.a:0 "As you wish."

 speer.902.t:0 "The Eastern Question"
 speer.902.d:0 "By god, but Landrut could talk. Since his arrival in Germania he had been gushing to Speer about this reform and that, barely giving him a chance to get a word in edgeways. Albert preferred it that way however. It gave him a better chance to determine what sort of man he truly was - an idealist who believed in democracy, or a pragmatist choosing his words to obtain popular support. A dangerous element to be removed, or a man he could work with. His fingers toyed at the button beneath his desk as Landrut went on and on. A single push, and the guards outside would have Landrut in a cell within seconds. His advisors would be furious to find out he had arrested a reformist ally, but he could certainly do with some credit from the more conservative elements of the party. Landrut seemed to have noticed his contemplation, for he stopped his waffling for a moment. "Mein Führer? Is something wrong?""
 speer.902.a:0 "This idiot really believes what he says. Press the button."
 speer.902.b:0 "He can be trusted to act in his own self interest."

 speer.903.t:0 "A Disappointing Meeting"
 speer.903.d:0 ""Mein Führer? Is something wrong?" Speer was broken from his reverie when Landrut ceased his speech. Andreas had been expecting... well, he hadn't been quite sure, but he had expected some response to his plans. Surely the man would be champing at the bit to incorporate his ideas, some of the only truly reformist ideas in the Reich - apart from his own, of course. Instead, he had just listened. \n\n"My apologies Andreas, I simply have a lot on my mind. It is good to find a true ally in these trying times. I am grateful for your work in Ostland, and now that it has been restored to the Reich we can get to work with our plans."\n\nWith that the Führer clearly considered the meeting over, as he rose and extended his hand. Meyer-Landrut clasped it in a firm grip, and shook it with enthusiasm. \n\n"Of course - the Führer's work is never done. Heil Speer!" He extended his arm in salute. When there was no response, he opened the door, chastened. \n\nOutside the door were half a dozen hulking OrPo officers, each one with their eyes locked on Andreas. He gulped. Surely, he didn't warrant such measures? He did his best to ignore the fact that they had their hands on their holstered pistols, and made his way out."
 speer.903.a:0 "Why does it feel like I have cheated death?"

 speer.904.t:0 "Idealism is a Fool's Game"
 speer.904.d:0 ""Herr Meyer-Landrut, you are under arrest for treason against the acting Reichskommissar of Ostland." \n\nMeyer-Landrut's mouth hung agape as the doors behind Speer opened with a crash, and half a dozen OrPo agents stormed into the room. As he tried to rise, his head was instead slammed against the table and handcuffs forced onto his wrists. \n\n"Mein Führer, I don't understand? I thought you were -" Whatever he was about to say was cut off as a bag was forced over his head. As he was frogmarched from the room, Speer didn't spare him a glance, instead contemplating the glass in his hand. Another traitor dealt with."
 speer.904.a:0 "Install someone smarter in his place."

 speerostland.6.t:0 "Dinner in Riga"
 speerostland.6.d:0 "Schmidt was already seated when Stahlecker entered the restaurant. The foreign minister stood, extending a hand. "Herr Stahlecker. A pleasure." The Reichskommissar grimaced and took Schmidt's hand before sitting. \n\n"Now, I assume you understand why we've called these negotiations. Germania is interested in returning Ostland into the Reich after our unfortunate separation. Are there any particular conditions your government is interested in?" \n\nStahlecker eyed the man opposite him carefully. "I would like to keep my position as Reichsminister in your new Ostland. And I would like immunity for my men. These are my requests." \n\n"One moment, Herr Stahlecker, I need to take a call." \n\nSpeer was on the other end of the line, and Schmidt relayed the information. The Führer and the foreign minister were faced with two choices. On the one hand, accepting Stahlecker's demands might ease the negotiation process and appease the existing regime there. On the other, a show of force and denial of Stahlecker's requests would appease the conservatives in the Party, and demonstrate Speer's courage and power as Führer. Speer pondered the options, and made his decision, hanging up the phone."
 speerostland.6.a:0 "Accept the demands. The less blood, the better."
 speerostland.6.b:0 "Push Stahlecker further. We're the Reich, not him."

 speerostland.7.t:0 "Investigating Insurgents"
 speerostland.7.d:0 ""Herr Stahlecker, the Führer is unable to fully grant one of your requests." The Reichskommissar eyed Schmidt sternly. "In good news, the majority of your said conditions can be guaranteed." \n\n"What is the catch, Herr Schmidt." \n\n"Your lower cabinet members will need to be investigated for security purposes. They may pose a considerable threat to the government in Germania, due to their links with the traitorous Bormann. I'm sure you understand that, in these trying times, the safety, wellbeing and stability of the Reich's people are of utmost importance to the Führer, and we can't be taking any major risks." Schmidt forced a smile. "For the good of the country, Herr Stahlecker." \n\nThe Ostlander stared at the table, grimacing. Schmidt observed him, wondering what thoughts lay behind those half glazed eyes."
 speerostland.7.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.8.t:0 "A Begrudging Acceptance"
 speerostland.8.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "I mean no disrespect, Herr Schmidt, but the past is the past. These are good men. Any grievances they may have had with your people can surely be overcome peacefully." \n\n"Herr Stahlecker, I appreciate your concern for your fellow Germans. Really, it is an honourable trait to have. As I said, however, the times cannot call for the sort of leniency that may have otherwise been desirable. In an ideal world, I would agree with you. Let bygones be bygones. The Führer, however, does not orchestrate an Elysium. We are building it, and we cannot allow workers who might pour sugar into our concrete. The new Germany needs stability." \n\nAnother long silence, before Stahlecker finally spoke."Okay. I will comply."\n\nSchmidt smiles warmly. "Thank you, Reichskommissar. One moment, please. I have to take this call.""
 speerostland.8.a:0 "Our negotiations push for more concessions, the man seems agreeable."
 speerostland.8.b:0 "Our negotiations accept Stahlecker's concessions, he has sacrificed much."

 speerostland.9.t:0 "No Reich for Old Men"
 speerostland.9.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "Do you remember what we saw out there, Herr Schmidt? During the war? You weren't there for long, were you?" \n\n"Herr Stahlecker-" \n\n"I won't be coddled or convinced with a 'Herr', Schmidt." Stahlecker leant forward and stood slightly, pressing his palms into the table as he stared directly into the foreign minister's eyes. \n\n"We saw a countryside littered with Jewry and Bolshevism. We saw a land once roamed by our German and Baltic forefathers corrupted with the burning greed and degeneracy of the Slavic swine. It was disgusting, Schmidt. It was horrifying. When we cleansed it, we liberated the land from it's filth. Yet we did not go far enough." \n\nStahlecker stood up from the table. "Ostland has been through a civil war, and my men won it. We fought the forces of Jewry and Bolshevism with a loyalty to the party, and to the ideas of Hitler and National Socialism. Bormann, Bormann represented those loyalties. You, and that fraudulent Führer of yours, would return Ostland to these devils. My men, they have committed crimes by the standard of your petty courts. They loved Bormann. Under your false laws, they are guilty, but under God, they are innocent." \n\nThe Reichskommissar, before Schmidt could respond, had walked out the door. In the heavens, the drums of war began to beat."
 speerostland.9.a:0 "Scheiße."

 speerostland.10.t:0 "A Second Demand"
 speerostland.10.d:0 "Schmidt put down the phone. His eyes had already communicated enough information to Stahlecker for a single glance to turn the Reichskommissar into a daze of despair. "Herr Stahlecker, the Führer has requested that the investigations might widen their scope." \n\nStahlecker sighed audibly. "I understand your reservations about this, but you must understand that the Reich cannot afford any chances at any level of government, especially the higher levels. Think of what one disloyal minister could do. Fraudulent documents, leaked information; sabotage at these levels could ruin the Reich." \n\nIn the Reichskommissar's head, thoughts were buzzing. His men were being threatened. This regime, this new Germany, this new Führer, they didn't care about him or his people. But did he have a choice? If he didn't comply, then what? The Heer would simply storm the border, and his government would be wiped off the face of the planet. Besides, Schmidt hadn't mentioned anything about him being put on trial himself..."
 speerostland.10.a:0 "What is a warlord to do?"

 speerostland.11.t:0 "A Second Concession"
 speerostland.11.d:0 "Stahlecker looks at Schmidt, any semblance of light fading from his eyes as he did so. "I concede, Herr foreign minister. For the good of the country." \n\nSchmidt nodded with an expression of solemn sympathy for the terrified Reichskommissar. "Thank you, Herr Stahlecker. I understand how difficult this must be for you, but it is in all Germany's best interest. Excuse me for one moment, I need to take this call...""
 speerostland.11.a:0 "Give the man a break. A peaceful transition is now more than possible."
 speerostland.11.b:0 "Another push. The man himself must be trialled; who knows what hidden sympathies lie behind that quiet exterior..."

 speerostland.12.t:0 "A Bridge Too Far"
 speerostland.12.d:0 "Stahlecker glared at Schmidt. A palpable rage stretched across the man's face as he did so, breaking the facade of courtesy he had built up over the course of the negotiation. "You would have every German in Ostland hung for treason, Herr Schmidt. Your 'reformists' in Germania are no better than the savages of Burgundy." \n\nThe Reichskommissar stood, Schmidt staring in a frozen awe. "When Bormann fell, so did the last hope for the Reich. Your petty Führer doesn't deserve to even be called a German." \n\nWith a mild flourish of his coat, Stahlecker turned and left the room. Above the room and across Yggdrasil, the drums of war in Asgard began to beat. In the quiet of the negotiations chamber, Schmidt could hear them, just barely. A sign from the gods of more to come."
 speerostland.12.a:0 "Scheiße."

 speerostland.13.t:0 "A Final Demand"
 speerostland.13.d:0 "The phone hit the shelf, and Schmidt returned to the table. "A final issue to iron out, Herr Stahlecker." By the tone in his voice, almost forcefully gentle, Stahlecker understood what Schmidt was about to say. "The Führer requests that you undergo a trial, a fair one, just to ensure Germania understands your past. I personally trust that you would remain quiet loyal to the Reich, Herr Reichskommissar, but to secure the doubts in my government, I would recommend this path." \n\nStahlecker's depressed expression morphed into something of an abject terror. "I would keep in mind, Herr Stahlecker, that refusal to comply with these demands may end with more trouble for you and your government than compliance.""
 speerostland.13.a:0 "Let us hope he sees reason."
 
 speerostland.14.t:0 "A Final Concession"
 speerostland.14.d:0 "Stahlecker began a shaky nod. "I-I understand Herr Schmidt." The foreign minister extended his hand for a comforting handshake. "Thank you, Herr Stahlecker. You have served your country well." \n\nSchmidt understood the criminality of the man opposite him, but couldn't help but question himself. Was he the good guy anymore? Threatening these men with a purge or trial? Demanding concessions for a Reich he didn't believe in. For the good of the country, he told himself."
 speerostland.14.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.15.t:0 "Mortal Danger"
 speerostland.15.d:0 "Stahlecker stood abruptly, stumbling away from the table. "N-no, Herr Schmidt. I-I can't do that." \n\nThe foreign minister stood, reaching out to try and comfort the man. "Herr Stahlecker, please, we can negotiate this." \n\n"No Schmidt. Y-you're all crazy. You'll kill me! You-you'll kill all of us!" \n\nThe Reichskommissar ran out of the room.

 speerostland.15.a:0 "War is coming."

 speerostland.16.t:0 "The Stahlecker Situation"
 speerostland.16.d:0 ""Franz Walter Stahlecker. Bormannite, and presently, Reichskommissar of Ostland," began the Führer. "In any situation, a major obstacle in our diplomatic reconstruction of the Reich's power."\n\n"Agreed, my Führer," replied Helmut Schmidt. \n\n"We need to rid ourselves of this blight quickly. I invited you here to discuss our options. You'll be leading a diplomatic envoy to the East to deal with the situation there. Any ideas?" \n\nSchmidt shuffled in his seat. "Well, my Führer..." His voice trailed off. \n\n"I'm listening, Schmidt." \n\n"I think it would be best to negotiate with Stahlecker. It might win us favour with the conservatives and give a show of force by punishing the traitor. We could force him into a harsh agreement and reintegrate Ostland back into the Reich that way. An enemy gone, territory gained and our friends in the Party might look at us with kinder eyes." \n\nSpeer stared into middle distance, thinking, but slowly nodding in approval. Schmidt couldn't help a slight, genuine smile at the peaceful route being favoured. "Or," Speer began, "we might declare war immediately. Rally the support of the reformists in a direct action and put him down quickly and effectively." \n\nSchmidt's expression morphed into something more familiarly depressed as he slouched in his chair. He let out a short and inaudible sigh. "It's your choice, my Führer." \n\n"Indeed. It is.""
 speerostland.16.a:0 "Diplomacy! Send Schmidt and the envoy."
 speerostland.16.b:0 "War! Rally the Heer and man the border."

 speerostland.18.t:0 "Drechsler In Ostland"
 speerostland.18.d:0 ""Otto-Heinrich Drechsler. Militarist, expansionist, traitor, and victor." Speer read the report slowly, carefully taking in every detail. He knew Drechsler from his experience before the Burgerkrieg. The man was a paranoid coward, constantly itching for a fight, being a general pain. It was a surprise he'd never been disposed of.\n\nAnd yet, even as he caused problems in the east. Speer realized something. Drechsler was the perfect heel. Not only was he a traitor, but he was a militarist. Somehow, in losing- apparently, there had been a reformist in the Ostland chaos at some point- Speer had won more than he ever could have expected. A perfect target, a perfect ball and chain to tie to the reactionaries. Even if it would benefit the Gang as much as it benefited him, Speer was more than willing to make that sacrifice. Soon, Ostland would be under German control again, and the face of the traitors- along with their military ranks- would be plastered across every newspaper in Germany."
 speerostland.18.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.19.t:0 "Vituska In Ostland"
 speerostland.19.d:0 ""So, who is this Michal Vituska?" Speer read the report with interest, looking between it and Schmidt slowly, his eyes glancing over the little information that the paper provided.\n\n"We aren't entirely sure, Albert." Schmidt said with a sigh. "His past is. . .well, murky would be an understatement. What we know about him is that he's been a loyal collaborator with a lot of luck- at least, up until the Burgerkrieg, where he broke away from the Reichskommissariat to form a Central European Council, as he calls it. He's the dominant power in Ostland today."\n\n"And you said he was willing to negotiate?" Albert's eyes pored over the papers. Vituska's history was interesting, to say the least. A number of strange events and coincidences had brought him to the position of power he had held before Ostland broke down- definitely something that raised his eyebrow. Perhaps the man was more clever than he seemed.\n\n"Yes, he's said he's willing to cooperate. Shall I send an invitation?" Schmidt said. Speer nodded, and the Foreign Secretary made his exit. The Fuhrer put down his paper- there were certainly worse possible outcomes."
 speerostland.19.a:0 "We'll see what he wants."

 speerostland.20.t:0 "Meeting The Man"
 speerostland.20.d:0 "Michel Vituska entered Speer's office with a hearty "Heil!" and a quick salute, taking his seat with haste. Speer cocked his head- whether the man was nervous or enthusiastic, he couldn't tell. He took a breath before beginning. "Herr Vituska, thank you for accepting these negotiations. I trust you know why we're here?"\n\n"Yes, of course." Vituska quickly said, fidgeting in his chair a little. Speer's eyebrow raised a little- for a skilled leader, Vituska definitely seemed a little worried. Maybe it was the stakes. He disregarded it.\n\n"Now, I understand you had a few requests in exchange for rejoining the Reich, yes?" Speer said calmly. Vituska fidgeted a little more in his seat before he began.\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer. I would request to retain my role as Reichskommisar of Ostland, in exchange for my continued collaboration. In addition to this, I would similarly ask for the restrictions that Germany currently holds over Ostland to be relaxed, if not removed. With these two caveats, I'd be more than happy to peacefully rejoin the Reich."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows furrowed, his face betraying confusion, anger, and bemusement all at the same time. "You've come all this way to ask me to give you almost unimpeded control over one of the Reich's most valuable territories?"\n\n"Well, I wouldn't put it like that." Vituska said. Speer scoffed. What a waste of time."
 speerostland.20.a:0 "Onto Plan B."

 speerostland.21.t:0 "Harder Than We Thought"
 speerostland.21.d:0 ""Herr Vituska, you must be joking. Even if I wanted to- and I don't- can you imagine the damage of giving a Slav control of a Reichskommissariat? I'd be laughed out of the Reichstag. It can't be done." Speer's tone had taken on an almost incredulous tilt. He half expected Vituska to laugh and explain that it was all a joke. He didn't.\n\n"Herr Speer, these are my conditions. If you do not accept them, these talks must adjourn."Vituska said. His earlier nervousness was gone, replaced with a steely look. As foolish as Speer considered the man, he had to admit that he had a lot of nerve. It would not save him.\n\n"Well, Herr Vituska, if these talks are adjourned, I have no choice but to mark you a traitor, which means. . ." Three guards entered the room, their weapons at the ready. Speer watched Vituska closely for his reaction. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion when the man smiled.\n\n"You didn't think he'd actually come to this meeting in person, did you?"\n\nSpeer froze for a moment, before reaching for the photograph of Vituska he had on his desk and holding it up to the man's face. At a glance, they seemed to match, but further inspection proved it- this was not the same person. He threw the photo down and sighed.\n\n"Son of a bitch.""

 speerostland.22.t:0 "Kovner In Ostland"
 speerostland.22.d:0 "During the Bürgerkrieg, chaos consumed much of Europe. Perhaps the most chaotic of these battlegrounds was not found in Frankfurt, or Saxony, but rather in Ostland. Ostland, once designed as "The Model Colony", proved that moniker to be a falsehood, as it fell to pieces within days of the Reich's own failure. Six sides burst from the unsteady Reichskommissariat, each fighting over the future of the area.\n\nStunningly, the United Partisan Organization, led by noted terrorist and murderer Abba Kovner, has come out on top of Ostland. This is an unmitigated disaster for us- not only because of Kovner's well-known Anti-German sentiment, but because of the political implications this holds. Already, conservatives in the Reichstag have made hay with this issue, attempting to tie our reformist views to this outcome. While this is unquestionably false, it's caught on in some circles, and our influence is bound to take a hit. Best to make short work of this and move on as fast as we can."
 speerostland.22.a:0 "What a mess."

 speerostland.23.t:0 "The Ostland Intervention"
 speerostland.23.d:0 "Speer's face paled as he read through the report. He was alone- there was no need for Schmidt, nor for anyone else in the Gang. No, this was an open-and-shut decision. An invasion was the only option for such a madman as Abba Kovner.\n\nThe reports chilled his blood to even look at. Stories of German soldiers being executed, German civilians being shot regularly, soldiers hanging from trees and lampposts- it was enough to make anyone retch. Such depraved brutality could not and would not be tolerated by the Reich.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the fastest the Reich's bureaucracy had moved since the Second World War. Within hours, divisions pushed across the Ostland border, engaging partisan forces wherever they found them. Each of them had two goals, and two goals only- push through Ostland as fast as possible, and save as many settlers as they could."
 speerostland.23.a:0 "There's no time to waste."

 speerostland.24.t:0 "Jeckeln In Ostland"
 speerostland.24.d:0 "Few names provoke such strong reactions in Germany as the name Schutzstaffel. Most react with hate, some with fear, some others with disgust. No matter who you ask, however, you're almost guaranteed to hear a tale of their brutality. One of the most widely reviled organizations in German history, the hope was that, with their defeat in the Burgerkrieg, they would be permanently banished to Burgundy to rot.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case.\n\nElements of the Ostland SS, led by Friedrich Jeckeln, have managed to seize control over Ostland, and are ruling with a fist of iron. Their maniacal ideology must be put down with extreme prejudice, effective immediately. On the political front, this development has aided the reformist wing of the party immeasurably, seeing as they've made numerous successful comparisons between the conservative wing of the Party and the SS. In any case, the intervention must happen, and it must happen soon, or there may be no Ostland to return to."

As he stepped inside, he could tell Speer was expecting him- he had been watching the door already. With a quick salute, he began.\n\n"My Fuhrer, as you know, Ostland is still engulfed in conflict. Their factions are still locked in combat with each other- six of them at start. That number has since been reduced."\n\nSpeer nodded. "Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\nSchmidt sighed. "There was, my Fuhrer, but his faction has been crushed. Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the industrialist. He gave it his best shot, but. . . well, he didn't succeed."\n\nSpeer grunted. "And there's nobody else there we could work with?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well." Speer looked out his window. "That's a pain, isn't it? Get the troops ready. We'll intervene, restore order, and go from there."\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer." And in a moment, Schmidt was gone."

"Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer." Speer perked up at that, his eyes widening. "Andreas Meyer-Landrut, a major industrialist in the region, has led a faction of reformists through the struggle. He's held his own quite well. Currently, he is the only faction I believe we could truly negotiate with."\n\nSpeer smiled. "Perfect. Organize an intervention. We'll move in, secure the region, and then take over for the man. It'll run like clockwork."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer." Schmidt said, with a smile on his face. It seemed both men were quite pleased with this result."
 speerostland.26.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.27.t:0 "Thank You For Your Service"
 speerostland.27.d:0 "Landrut smiled as he walked towards Speer, the men fast approaching each other in the hallway. Speer, for his part, looked suitably jovial as the men shared a warm handshake. "My Fuhrer, what an honor to meet you!" Landrut said amicably, his smile not leaving his face. Speer returned it.\n\n"Yes, Herr Landrut, you've truly done the Reich a service. Without you, this whole operation would be much more of a pain than it currently is. I can't thank you enough."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer. It was no trouble, really. I trust that this new administration will continue our efforts?"\n\n"Well, Herr Landrut, I need you to sign this first. Make it official and all." The two men stopped by a table with a paper on hand. Landrut took a pen and, still smiling, signed it. Speer smiled.\n\n"We can't thank you enough for your cooperation, Herr Landrut. Rest assured that Ostland will reform just as much as anywhere else in the Reich.""

 speer_moskowien.3.t:0 "God Help Me, I Was Only 19" #Start of German Soldier Event Chain
 speer_moskowien.3.d:0 "Matthäus Schornberger leaned his chair back on two legs and lit his cigarette. The smoke wafted lazily into the air before being suddenly sucked out of the room, dragged by the wind that blew through the opened window. He puffed thoughtlessly as he stared out the window, taking in his street on the west end of Fulda. His father would kill him if he found out he was smoking, which is why he had to do it up in his room on the third floor of their house, one level above the kitchen and two levels above his father's workshop, filled with the tools of a watchmaker. Of course, his father was much more than just a watchmaker- he was a hero, an Iron Cross recipient, first class. Though his father never flaunted it, he knew the neighbors knew it. You could see it in their enthusiastic greetings, their preference of his business over others, the favors and gifts they gave him. His father was a man that all, including Matthias, respected; a man who had stood up to the Judeo-Bolsheviks out east and obliterated them. He was a man to look up to.\n\nWhat did Matthäus have to look forward to in his life, anyhow? He had turned the question over and over in his mind for months now, and he still had no answer. Sure, he studied, as his father wished, but what was the point? The slaves did all the work that Germany needed already. Did he really want to waste what should be the greatest years of his life on a degree he would have no purpose for, just for a society that had no need for it?"
 speer_moskowien.3.a:0 "What's the use of it?"
 
 speer_moskowien.77.t:0 "Making Up His Mind"
 speer_moskowien.77.d:0 "The army, on the other hand, was where Matthäus saw his legacy being made. There, he could serve a purpose to his fatherland. He could come home and have the same respect his father had. He could be someone, do something, and come home a stronger, wiser man, just as his father had. Besides, he still remembered the war stories his father had told him back when he was a boy. They spoke of joy and camaraderie, of glorious victories over the Jews and Slavs, of a great triumph and the stories that accompanied it. That sounded much better to Matthäus than sitting around in an office twiddling his thumbs for the rest of his life.\n\n The only thing that had been stopping him from rushing off to the recruitment office so far was, strangely enough, his father. Matthäus had floated the idea past him once and quickly learned not to make that mistake again. He'd never seen his father so angry. He'd made him promise he'd never go to the Heer, under any circumstances. Of course, Matthäus had promised- what else was he going to do?- but now he wondered why. He sat for a moment, the wind blowing through his room, deep in thought.\n\nSuddenly, he snuffed his cigarette out against the windowsill. He knew why his father was so angry about the mere thought of his son in the Heer- he didn't think he could do it. His father thinks he was too soft, did he? He thought he couldn't handle war, did he? He thought Matthäus couldn't handle responsibility or pressure, or having people depending on him. Matthäus knew it to be true- his father didn't seem to have much of a problem with telling his war stories, did he? Was he scared that his son could possibly upstage him, do more than even he could? Well, he was going to see it now. Matthäus was going to go into the army, and he was going to make his father wonder why he'd ever doubted him. He was going to make him sorry he'd ever even tried to stop him. He was going to be a soldier, and nothing was going to get in his way.\n\nFuriously, Matthäus scribbled out a farewell note and slapped it down on the kitchen table on his way to the door. While grabbing his coat, he turned around to savor the view of the house one more time. He was going to come back, and he was going to be more than his father could ever have dreamed of being.\n\nHe was going to be a hero."
 speer_moskowien.77.a:0 "Like Father, like son."


 speer_moskowien.4.t:0 "Crisp Uniform"
 speer_moskowien.4.d:0 "The wind swept Matthäus's hair to the side as he stood in front of the recruiting office. The cold, concrete building almost seemed to stare right back at him, looking straight through him. In front of the building stood two Heer members, dressed in full parade attire. SIlently, he made his way past them and into the building.\n\n"Heil Speer!" The recruiting officer, sitting neatly at his desk, snapped to his salute, an action Matthäus returned. "What can I do for you, sir?"\n\n"I'm looking to join the Heer, sir." Matthäus replied, confidently. He made sure to keep his chest out and chin up.\n\n "Good, good. Just sign these papers and go into that room back there. You'll find a uniform, a helmet, and we'll direct you onto a bus out of here shortly."\n\nMatthäus sat down in front of the table, the pen clicking in his hands. Multiple papers were set in front of him, each detailing oaths and promises. "I will be loyal to the Fuhrer and to Germany." "I will not falter in my duty to the Reich." "I will uphold and support my fellow soldier, and follow orders without question." Yes, yes, and yes. He soon began to stop reading the papers, simply signing where they asked him to. Finally, he moved on to the back room, where his uniform awaited him.\n\nCrisp, folded, and clean, the grey uniform sat among rows of other uniforms identical to it. A small part of Matthäus's mind told him that this would be the cleanest he'd ever see it. He grabbed one that fit him, trying on the tunic and pants. The helmet, clean and polished, didn't fit all that well, but Matthäus couldn't find one that fit better, so he took it. When he was ready, he marched proudly out of the room and into the back, taking a seat besides other, similarly uniformed recruits.\n\nWithin minutes, a bus pulled up to the office, and the men were loaded on. As the bus pulled away, Matthäus took one last look around the city he had called home all his life. A new chapter of his story was just beginning."
 speer_moskowien.4.a:0 "Just sign on the dotted line."
 
 speer_moskowien.5.t:0 "Harsh Reality"
 speer_moskowien.5.d:0 "Get over the wall, maggot!"/n/nMatthäus's legs swung and scratched helplessly at the bricks, his hands barely grasping onto the edge of the wall he dangles from. Below him, a small queue was beginning to pile up, men watching his every swing as he desperately struggled for any traction. Though he couldn't see him, he could already tell the drill sergeant was getting closer to him.\n\n"There's Russian machine guns behind you, boy! They're getting closer, they're gonna kill your squadmates if you don't get past that fucking wall, boy!" Soft chuckles from the men below him. What made the situation even more humiliating was that none of the men before him had many problems with getting up and over. It was Matthäus, and Matthäus alone, who was struggling so much with it. He tried to pull himself up and over again, to no avail.\n\n"They're on top of us now, boy! They're shredding us, boy, there's guts all over your legs, boy, get over that wall!" Matthäus was about ready to just let go and quit. He wasn't made out for this, clearly. His father had been right.\n\nThe thought stopped him in his tracks. His father, if he returned home, would be insufferable. He would be right that Matthäus wasn't strong enough for this. Matthäus could picture his dad cracking open a beer in his shop, saying to some curious customer, "I told him over and over to not go, but he did, and you know what happened? I was right, and he's back at home now. I tell you, they aren't made like they used to be, are they?"\n\nWith a final heave, Matthäus pushed over the wall and fell to the ground on the other side. The drill sergeant gave him shit, for sure, but he didn't hear it. He was still going. He was still a soldier."
 speer_moskowien.5.a:0 "It was a long march from cadets..."
 
 speer_moskowien.7.t:0 "The Fighting 16th"
 speer_moskowien.7.d:0 "The truck shook and rattled as it rolled along the autobahn, staying behind the truck in front of it. Matthäus knew where they were going, and it shook him a little bit. The convoy was headed to Danzig- the furthest Matthäus had ever been from Fulda was Germania, and that had only been once or twice. Fulda, and the area around it, had been all he had known. Shaking a little, he pulled his assignment orders out of his pocket, reading them over for what seemed to be the hundredth time. Everything was in order- He was on a truck to Danzig to join the 16th Infantry Division. He assumed the men around him were on the same journey. The 16th Infantry- not a division that Matthäus had heard of in passing, but name recognition didn't matter much.\n\nThe man next to him tapped him on the shoulder. "Hey." he said cautiously. "You're from Bachrain?"\n\n"Oh, yeah, I've lived there my whole life."\n\n"Me too." The man said. "Schornberger. . .I feel like I've heard the name. The watchmaker, right?"\n\n"Not me. That's my dad."\n\n"Oh, really? He's good at what he does. A soldier too, I've heard. You following in his footsteps?"\n\n"Not exactly." Matthäus laughed. The two men's conversation continued, and soon other men began to join in. Matthäus learned they were all going to the 16th as well, as he expected. Most were from around Fulda, if not the city itself, though there were some from other areas. One even said he was from Vienna. Soon, the squad became fast friends. It's hard not to like someone when you spend 3 hours of a boring truck ride talking to them. As Matthäus spoke, he knew that he'd truly found his calling. If only his father could see him now!"
 speer_moskowien.7.a:0 "Good men, all of them."
 
 speer_moskowien.6.t:0 "New Orders"
 speer_moskowien.6.d:0 "It was a normal day in Danzig, as the last six months had been. Matthäus lay in his bunk, daydreaming of going home. This wasn't the hero's life he had been promised. Indeed, the most action he had seen was an out of control truck crashing into the wall of the base a few months back. The rest of his time had been spent idly patrolling various parts of Danzig, from the docks to the barracks to the Governor's Palace. In general, it seemed like Matthäus would never become the same hero his father had been- not for lack of trying, but simply out of lack of opportunity.\n\nHis friend, a fellow named Johan, opened the door to the barrack and walked inside. "Guys, pack your shit. We're leaving in two hours, going out east." He yelled, to the complaint of those who were catching up to the sleep they had lost in the last few days. The barracks sleepily came alive, as man after man rolled out of their beds to put on their uniform. Matthäus did not move, instead thinking for a moment, before catching Johan's attention.\n\n "Johan, where are we going? What are we doing out east?"\n\n "We're being deployed. Apparently we're restoring order to the east, or some shit. I'm not clear on the details myself, but I know we're being deployed."\n\n Matthäus rushed from his bed, eager to get his pack ready. Finally, some action! He had been hoping for this day ever since he had joined the Heer. All the training, all the waiting, all the busywork- all had been leading up to these moments, where Matthäus could finally prove that, yes, he was able to do all the same work and more that his father did so many years ago. Within a few minutes, his personal items rested snugly in his pack. Matthäus, now dressed in his field greys, took one look at himself in the mirror on the wall before he marched outside to the trucks.\n\nHe looked quite nice. He looked natural. Above all else, he looked ready."
 speer_moskowien.6.a:0 "Things are picking up."
 
 speer_moskowien.8.t:0 "The Battle of Smolensk"
 speer_moskowien.8.d:0 "Matthäus's G1 rocked violently in his hands as he emptied the magazine down the street. All around him, his squadmates did their best to keep the fire going, ducking occasionally to avoid return fire. Matthäus ducked down again to reload, not even noticing the bullets that cracked the wall behind him. For now, his mind was solely focused on not dying, and serving his homeland. Even with his focus, and his attempts to keep composure, he could feel the manic feeling of terror slowly rising within him, as it had for almost an hour now. How long had they been fighting in this street for? How much ammo could they possibly have left, and what would happen if they ran out?\n\nFor now, however, those thoughts were quickly pushed away by a sharp tap from his NCO.\n\n "Schornberger! I need you to do some shit for us!" the man shouted, but whatever he shouted was drowned out by the next man over's yelling.\n\n"Holy shit! Johan just ate a fucking grenade up there!"\n\nMatthäus looked over the trench to the next foxhole, where his friend was noticeably absent. As he looked, however, he noticed movement in a ruined house, off to the left. None of his squadmates were in there- could a flanking attack be coming? A quick slap from the NCO brought him back to attention.\n\n "Like I was saying, Private, I need you to find a command element, tell them to give us reinforcements, supplies, something! We're running low! You hear me, private?""
 speer_moskowien.8.a:0 "I gotta get Johan, sir! Give me a minute!"

 speer_moskowien.9.t:0 "The Red Badge of Courage."
 speer_moskowien.9.d:0 "Matthäus, without really even thinking about it, hopped over the wall and began his dash down the street. He didn't hear his NCO's shouting, whether it was positive or negative. All he heard was the thump of his own heart and the crackling of a machine gun, and suddenly the ground around him exploded in shards of stone and shrapnel as bullets crackled off the road around him. He didn't care, as long as they didn't hit him. By some divine miracle, or insane luck, they didn't. Matthäus managed to slide into the foxhole unscathed, slamming into the other wall from the sheer momentum he had carried. Quickly brushing himself off, he turned to find his friend.\n\nJohan was lying in a puddle of his own blood- a puddle that was now lapping around Matthäus's boots- with the look on his face of a rapidly dying man. His uniform, sliced to rags by the shrapnel, was now damp with blood from a thousand wounds. His arm, still holding his rifle, now lay severed behind him. As Matthäus watched in horror, Johan took one last look at him,eyes wide open, before finally falling silent.\n\n Matthäus was too terrified now to even throw up. His feeling of panic, which had been so well surpressed, now exploded just as ferociously as the grenade. In a blind moment of sheer terror, Matthäus scrabbled for the edge of the foxhole, looking for any means of escape, to run away, back past his line, out of Smolensk, all the way back to his house in Fulda.\n\nThe machine gun bullets cracked against the foxhole again, and Matthäus caught a stinging reminder of why the foxhole was there when one bullet grazed his fingers, sending him tumbling back into the blood puddle. Without covering fire, there was no way he could escape alive. Matthäus sank down against a wall, his eyes drawn to the corpse of what was once his friend. He couldn't look away. All he could do was sit and stare.\n\nThis wasn't at all like his father's stories."
 speer_moskowien.9.a:0 "Those eyes stared right back into him."
 
 speer_moskowien.10.t:0 "The Fastest Kid In The East"
 speer_moskowien.10.d:0 "With a jump, Matthäus was off, racing through the streets of Smolensk. Bullets cracked against the walls behind him, sending him stumbling into the next street. From there, he turned, running with his head down as he raced past corpses upon corpses. The screaming of the dying and the wounded rattled through his head as he ran, still looking for any sort of command element.\n\nFive blocks down, he stumbled into a makeshift hospital, hastily thrown together in the chaos of the fighting. He pushed through doctors tending to their patients, nurses carrying bodies off of beds and into a pile further away, and the occasionally walking wounded waiting for a table to open up. Finally, he broke free of the chaos, continuing his search.\n\nThe horrors of the battle he had fought through became more and more clear as he seemingly revisited them all on his path. On the way forward, it had been easy to ignore them, what with the battle and bullets flying everywhere. Now, on the way back, there was no haze to cover up the bodies, the blood, and the wreckage.\n\nEventually, Matthäus did find the command center. He barely even noticed himself monotonely requesting extra supplies for his position. When the commander heeded his request, sending men to relieve his unit, Matthäus hardly noticed. He instead sat down in a corner and tried to comprehend what he had seen."
 speer_moskowien.10.a:0 "Not all fun and games."
 
 speer_moskowien.11.t:0 "If You Could Find It In Your Heart"
 speer_moskowien.11.d:0 "Matthäus gingerly entered the building, rifle ready in his hands. He noticed a slight shake to his aim- perhaps from adrenaline, perhaps from fear. The sounds of the battle roaring outside were now only muffled cracks and bangs reverberating through the walls. The house itself was dark- the electricity had been cut long ago- and the only light that filtered in came through cracks in the ceiling and walls. Matthäus's eyes strained to see clearly in the darkness as he slowly moved forwards.\n\nA whimper in the next room caught his attention, and Matthäus stopped dead in his tracks. He could hear faint breathing, labored and wheezing as it was. A small shuffle confirmed that the source of the noise was off to the right. Slowly, Matthäus steeled himself and popped around the corner.\n\nA beam of light illuminated a young Russian, no older than Matthäus himself, slick with blood. A picture lay in his right hand, a old rifle in his left. The two regarded each other for moment, neither moving a muscle, as if they shared a connection among the chaos of war.\n\nMatthäus raised his rifle and pumped six rounds into the boy, silencing his breaths. The picture fell from his hand, and Matthäus was barely able to make out the boy standing with his mother and father.\n\nMatthäus exited the house blankly, returning to the line. The Sergeant asked him if the building was clear, which Matthäus could only reply with a nod. Without another word, Matthäus returned to the line, firing the occasional shot down at the enemy."

 speer_moskowien.12.d:0 "The visions wouldn't stop.\n\nMatthäus tossed and turned in his bed, over and over, and they just wouldn't go away. The street, the battle,the things he had seen- all kept replaying in his head, like a long, terrible movie. He couldn't stop thinking about the crack of rifle fire, the screams of the wounded and dying, or the yelling of men who knew that, at any moment, they could be dead. After an hour of this torture, Matthäus resolved for another sleepless night. He quietly hopped out of his bunk, trudging to the bathroom. Perhaps he could fix himself there.\n\nOnce he got into the dim light of the bathroom, he took a long look at himself. A tired, unshaven face stared right back into his eyes. One simultaneously young in body but old in mind. Perhaps, with a few touch-ups and a good shave, he could look like the boy he once was, but one look into his own dull eyes was a surefire tell that he wasn't truly the boy from Fulda anymore.\n\nHe took a sip of water out of the sink, washing his face afterwards, before heading back to his bed. There, he lay down quietly, waiting for the sun to come up and a new day to start."

 speer_moskowien.13.d:0 "So that's when I said to him, 'Alright, you little shit, why don't you come over here and fight me for it?'. And he ran!"\n\nThe table erupted with laughter as the man finished his story, and Matthäus cracked a smile of his own. These were good people he had met- being new to Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität was quite the overwhelming experience. Matthäus had managed, but it seemed he had finally met some people he could fit in with.\n\n "So that's how high school ended for me. Matthäus, you're the new one here. What did you do before University?"\n\n "I, ah. . ." Mathaus paused for a moment. How would they react? Should he be honest? Christ, they're all looking at him now. No time to think.\n\n "I served with the Heer out east, in Smolensk."\n\nAnother moment of silence around the table- perhaps a silence for Matthäus's chances of making friends here. "Well, uh, that's interesting." said one.\n\n "Did you kill anyone?" said another, entirely too excited for the question he had asked."\n\n "What war?" said a third. Matthäus did not answer any of these questions. Instead, he picked up his bag and quickly walked out of the cafeteria. They didn't understand. Nobody here did, and nobody here ever would. He was alone, and perhaps he always would be."

 speer_moskowien.14.d:0 "Great minds were gathered with Speer. Politicians and military officers pored over great maps of old and new. The Fuhrer listened to what those around him now were discussing. Their ideas mixed together. That formed a great concoction of intellect that made little sense as emotions were injected into it followed by urgency.\n\nBut Speer knew that he had to keep his head above the murky waters of the war room. Here, in Germania, he had to make great efforts to prevail against both the military and the Slavs to the East. \n\nHere, Speer reminded himself, he had to keep eyes and ears everywhere. And right now, he had to take a breath and dive under the surface.\n\nThere he was with the sharks. And they were Speidel, Schörner, and Tresckow.\n\nSpeer estimated that Speidel would want something slow, something careful. Tresckow wanted a balanced approach. And Schörner, for the animal that he was, with war always his aim, wanted something hard...something fast, and that, Speer told himself, was dangerously similar to the old way of war.\n\nNow their squabbling was coming to an end as they turned to Speer, who had looked up at them. Speer cleared his throat and began to speak.\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.15.d:0 ""I must suggest that we take this carefully," Speidel said. He gestured to the map, explaining his plan, "It would make us seem reasonable, careful. It would allow us to behave better. We would take on the appearance of peacekeepers. We would not show too much force but instead we would show our intentions to give support to our own people in the East."\n\n Schörner shook his head at his words and told him to his face, "You are asking too much of our boys. You don't know what it's going to be like for them to face the Slavs. Those people would shoot our boys even if they behaved nicely and spoke to them politely. Neither they nor we are friendly neighbors now, are we?"\n\nBut Tresckow shot at him with words. "You're right, but this can save civilian lives." Schörner groaned at that and scoffed. Tresckow ignored him, adding to Speidel's points, "It can keep us from playing too much of a part in bringing the blood of innocent people on our troops. And it would show to the world that we are being intelligent about it."\n\n"What's intelligent is getting our men into the fire and out of there quickly rather than asking them to stay in the fire and do nothing," Schörner said, his face clearly showing that he wasn't having it from either of them.\n\n"It isn't going to be like that," Speidel told him, "because this will show the natives that we are not here to kill them all. They might even cooperate with us."\n\n"Hah! Good luck with that. No Slav would embrace us."\n\n"They won't, but it's worth trying. I'd rather keep civilian casualties low and our troops safe with careful officers rather than go headlong into a war that will spill the blood of everyone involved, either civilian or not," Tresckow added.\n\n"And this is only a plan. It's all up to our Fuhrer to decide what must be done." Speidel and his fellow officers now turned to Speer. The Fuhrer had listened to them."

 speer_moskowien.20.d:0 "The German army crawls closer to the enemy's lands, drawing itself deeper into the territories of the natives. Slowly.\n\nIt gnawed on the minds of both the enlisted men and their officers. The fear of being shot at by patient snipers or angry villagers settled on their shoulders the more they marched and halted and marched out again. But when no shot rang out, when no man shouted for cover or a medic, it seemed to them that the plan was working.\n\nStill, the Germans were cautious. And when they encountered civilians, reluctant men would remove themselves from the company of their comrades and their vehicles, carrying some rations or some kind of supplies to them. Most of the time, the meetings were brief, awkward, and all too nerve wracking on everyone. But at least those ended well. The rest of the encounters were either quite wholesome or quite bothersome.\n\nThe more they moved into the heart of the native territories, the more resistance and reluctance they found. Civilians either refused to welcome them, take their supplies, or reconsider shooting them. Snipers took advantage of kind German soldiers. And officers found themselves commanding squads of men yelling for permission to shoot back.\n\nAnd understandably, the officers were not enjoying this kind of control over what they had to do on the field. To have to put up with irritating villagers as well as hostile enemy elements was adding to their dissatisfaction.\n\n"

What is going on?"\n\nSpeidel, who seemed as shocked by such insubordination, said, his hands also shifting papers on his part of the table from place to place, "They're all asking to be court-martialed! They can't just refuse to obey orders like this! This places the entire plan in the mercy of the enemy."\n\nTresckow added, closing the folder containing his copies of what was sent to them from the East, "They should face justice. It's unbecoming of our officers to disobey the instructions of our Fatherland. But I am not sure we should be punishing them in such a great scale. What would they say about us if we put them all down?"\n\nSpeidel turned to him, "Do you suggest relaxing our instructions?"\n\n"No. I do not. But to sentence them all..." Tresckow shook his head and sighed. "Look, I do not think that it is going to make things easier for our men and the other officers following our instructions if we do away with these men. But it could most likely be the only thing we can do."\n\n"It's not surprising. I would agree with them, honestly," Schörner quipped, drawing the irritated glances of the two other officers, "I really think it's better for us all to be lenient. No use in wasting our officers."\n\nThe Fuhrer sighed. He got up, and so did the officers."

When they arrived, they were to await their executions.\n\nFor days, they seemed to protest their fates. Others accepted them quietly. The rest just couldn't believe it. Their own Fatherland was doing this to them, all because they saw the ridiculousness of having to follow orders that kept them from doing their duties.\n\nNevertheless, no matter how much they wanted not to face the sentences put on them, several of them were taken out in Berlin to be hanged in public. And there would be no way to refuse a hanging.\n\nBy groups, they were noosed. By groups, they were given chances to speak their last words. By groups, they were told of their crimes again. And by groups, they were dropped, their faces concealed by black hoods, their bodies suspended by the necks. Much to the cheers of the student movement which opposed them as well as to the grief of their families and fellow officers.\n\nThey were not to be buried as heroes. But instead, they would be buried as mere men who didn't want to obey their Fatherland, even if it meant being careful for the sake of saving its reputation.\n\n"

And they did so to do what they could not have done when those orders, those restrictions, were all in place.\n\nAnd all over the East, blood was spilled. Not only of the enemy, but also of their families and neighbors. And soon enough, reports streamed out from the East and into the West and out into the world.\n\nBut this was a good price to pay in order to get the war going again. To get it done. It was better than constantly moving then halting then moving again. It was better than waiting for orders all the way from the Fatherland. It was better than nothing, right? Right?\n\n"

That was better than any of the other alternatives. It prolonged the war, but it was better than staining the name of the Fatherland with the crimes and the bloodshed of past conflicts. It had to be. It all had to be.\n\nAnd the Fuhrer could count on it. With thanks to Speidel and to Tresckow, even as Schörner never really let that go, he could have faith in a future where Germany would be praised for its restraint and not for its barbarity. He could at least see a light at the end of the dark tunnel which it passed for choosing to intervene out there, out in the bloody East.\n\nBut with refreshing results came depressing implications. From the lieutenant up to the highest ranking officers of Germany's armed forces, especially the Heer, there was going to be hell to pay. And that was kept to their breasts privately, beneath their coats and their helmets, they all held their Fuhrer and his lackeys responsible for holding them back, for making them do nothing when they should have been free to do something.\n\n"

"Well," he said, "what's your plan then?"\n\nSpeidel and Schörner both looked towards Tresckow; the former with hopeful eyes, the latter with fiery ones. Tresckow ignored them both and told Speer to his face, "We move at a moderate pace. We do not slow down if we don't have to and we do not force our men to move faster if the situation does not call for it. We are supposed to enter the Eastern territories with a flexible attitude and outlook."\n\nIt made sense. Speer saw that this compromise from Tresckow could save more lives than either Schörner's or Speidel's proposals. But he knew that Tresckow's was an option that would still lead to a significant number of losses. But this should serve as the one that would bleed Germany and the East less.\n\n"I see.

They cradled their weapons and set their eyes forward or around the convoy, suspicious of the quiet Russian trees and shrubs that lined their path. They were deep in the forests now, but they heard little from the birds and the other kinds of animals that were living in them. What was going on?\n\n"Halt!" Many of the men who heard the order turned their heads. Right before their convoy, a burning carcass of a tank. The route was blocked. Then came sharp passing sounds from the left and right. Some men fell from their transports. Others dove behind large rocks or piles of dirt. A loud but brief explosion came from the back of the convoy. Then another.\n\n"Ambush! Ambush! Everyone dismount!" Officers and their noncoms hurried to get their men in order. Drivers stayed in their vehicles or abandoned them, forgetting their weapons or bringing them out. Riflemen and machine-gunners attempted to bring their sights against the enemy that was hitting them from everywhere. But they saw no Russian, only flashes of guns.\n\nScreams and shouts. Smoke from the burning vehicles. More explosions. Commands from noncoms pushing their men at the enemy. Officers on the radios.\n\nThe Germans got their minds back. They fought the Russians back. And they pushed them away from the convoy. But when they returned, they counted their losses. A dozen of their tanks and another dozen of their vehicles were lost. So many men lay on the ground or on their vehicles. This convoy had survived, but with these results, it could not go further into the East.\n\n"

It was almost peaceful, he thought, if only he had not gotten his country into a war out in the East. Again.\n\nHe looked down at the officers and their staffs making their way quickly into the building. The Fuhrer slipped back to his seat and waited for them to come in.\n\nWhen they did, the Fuhrer almost regretted it, because he heard Schörner blowing steam at the two others who followed after him.\n\n"I told you that your pretty compromise would not work! Look at what you've gotten the men into! An ambush!"\n\nTresckow, almost red faced, his expression set in Prussian stone, brought himself to his seat without speaking to him yet. Once there, he said, "This is not mine alone to bear. It was not my only responsibility to take care of the intervention. You both are officers of our country, are you not? Why didn't you get your hand into it yourself, Schörner?"\n\nSpeidel sat by Tresckow but too was not in a good mood about it. "Does it matter now, Tresckow? Look at the situation - we have hundreds of men dead. And we have lost valuable vehicles. Why were we not trying to be careful?"\n\n"If we moved too carefully, then we would have lost more men because we would be too slow!"\n\n"Gentlemen, enough." Speer stood up, getting the three to rise up from their seats too. "I know all of you are not in good spirits because of what happened, but if we let this stay over our heads, then there is no solving it." He now sat down, letting the others do so too. He looked at them all then said, "For now, listen. I know that you all have given the appropriate instructions for your people to take care of the survivors. I know that this probably deserves retaliation. But we also know that we have families now without their loved ones."\n\nThe officers nodded. They understood. And Speer now gave his order...\n\n"

They waved farewell to the family that welcomed them, seeing their faces, some of them still with red eyes and tears going down their cheeks, handkerchiefs wiping them away, for the last time. For now.\n\nSpeer sighed as he looked away, Tresckow glanced at the Fuhrer, seeing him with a frown so deep that he almost felt like comforting the man. But he was the Fuhrer, and as an officer under him, he thought it disrespectful to try to do too much for him.\n\nThe Fuhrer himself felt his own heart come under another weight. He had visited so many families all over Germania. Later, he would have to see to the other families in the rest of the Reich. He wondered how many times he could say those words. "I'm so sorry for your loss..."\n"I regret telling you that your son has fallen in..."\n"My deepest condolences go to you and  your family."\n"My sympathies are with you..."\n\nSpeer shook his head at himself, ignoring Tresckow's curious glance. The car had stopped. Tresckow reminded him as the Fuhrer stepped out, "This is the Kraus family. The soldier...he had-"\n\n"A pregnant wife and two daughters. I know." He turned to one of his escorts, who had left the car before he did, "Do we have the..." The escort nodded, looking up at the windows of the house. The Fuhrer followed as did Tresckow.\n\nFrom there, the silent eyes of the woman observed them. She seemed to tremble as she looked down at them.\n\nSpeer held his eyes up then sighed, reached for his hat, and took it off his head. Then he lowered his gaze and walked to the door and knocked gently. He waited for the woman to come down and open the door. When he saw her face, Speer thought he had seen the face of his own wife, in the same manner this woman showed her inevitable grief.\n\n"

The smaller ones scattered more easily over the city, obliterating those that were not on fire or else driving more of the flames into the rest of the area.\n\n"This is insane," Tresckow spoke, drawing Speer's eyes from the monitor. The Prussian was shaking his head, his eyes filled with dread and regret.\n\n"We have to do this," The Fuhrer said with resignation. His eyes returned to the monitor, ignoring Tresckow's following words.\n\n"As if we do not have any other choice! This isn't how we are supposed to respond to the enemy's forces! We're just killing civilians!"\n\n"What does it matter? Civilians are helping the enemy fight us off and kill our men. They deserve it, Tresckow," Schörner stated. Speidel said nothing, merely shaking his head.\n\n"It's still unnecessary! And it stains our honor as soldiers of Germany! This isn't the kind of war we should fight."\n\n"It is now," The Fuhrer said, "because this is the best way we can show force against the Slavs for what they've done."\n\nSchörner smiled. But Tresckow refused to let it go.\n\n"I will not stand for this. This is just not the right way of war. I will not have it, my Fuhrer. You must not let this happen! You should have not listened to him!"'\n\nThough he glared at Schörner, the Fuhrer said nothing. Speidel turned to him and told him, "What is done is done.

"No matter how careful we are, this whole thing is coming to a halt."\n\n"If you only just listened to me and kept going, we would have won this whole thing," Schörner boasted.\n\nTresckow glared at him and said, "We could lose more men if we force them to go into the jaws of the Russian resistance. Do you want them to go in there like blind men?"\n\n"Well, our soldiers are not blind, are they?" Shorner shot back.\n\n"Enough," Speer told them, his eyes remaining on the map, studying the lines and the units arranged for them all to see.

"Schörner, I know I am interested in a swift end to the bloodshed, but if we do that..."\n\n"If we do that, we save more lives - German lives! We should not care too much about the casualties of those causing trouble for our Fatherland in the East. Away with them, the pests!"\n\nTresckow turned to Speer as Speidel too scowled at the man. But Speer kept his attention only towards Schörner, hating him for what he suggested. He had a point, but what about our reputation? "What you suggest is as terrible as committing the same methods our men once used in the West Russian War and before! Are you not aware what you are risking with, Generalfeldmarschall?"\n\nThe determined army officer just shrugged at the Fuhrer and gestured towards the maps, especially to the units displayed. "I only suggest what works. It is better than delaying our men, delaying their support, and above all, delaying Germany's hand in saving our settlers. Is that not our purpose?"\n\nThe other two now turned to Speer, who still maintained a disgusted expression against Schörner.

And as they did, the people attempted to flee. They ran to the boats and when those were destroyed, they swam into the lake. Others ran out of the town, chased down by troops and vehicles, crushed by treads or by wheels, shot in the back if they were too slow or slipped into the ground.\n\nThe wounded who dared to crawl away or limp behind some rubble were bayoneted or finished off with pistols.

What you've done is a grave error on your part, not theirs."\n\nSpeidel now spoke up, to support Speer and Tresckow, "You also ignored statements by your own reconnaissance that no enemy resistance was found in the town. Evidence was laid down in front of you again and again but you did not respond. You ignored what they said. You set aside all the warnings!"\n\n"Would you rather I let that town come under Russian control? You don't know what's on the ground!" Schörner now pointed at Speidel, rudely so. "Why don't you try to see what happens when we don't make sure of what is there in the town or not?"\n\n"So you admit you destroyed it?" Speer asked sharply, a revolted smile on his face. "Well? You've done it. You've killed men, women, and children that had nothing to do with our enemy!"\n\n"I did what I had to do. I don't care what you all say! This is necessary.

 speer_moskowien.35.d:0 "The poorly built train provided no comfort for the Oberleutenant, as while the train whipping back and forth was usually no issue for supply shipments, personnel had been a different story. Not to mention the freezing temperatures that had plagued every one of the advisors as they prepared to reach Reichskommissariat Moskowien. But, as the Oberleutenant knew, comfort wasn't the priority of the Reich, was it? The train coming to a screeching halt painted a picture of his platoon's desperate stand at Bremen while he fought for Speer's succession. Exiting the train, he took one last look at his pocketwatch containing a picture of his wife before stepping off. \n\n The rumbling of the train made it hard to hear anything else, but for the Oberleutenant, the marching of boots managed to triumph the surrounding area, as more and more soldiers within Moskau prepared themselves through the bustling streets, as if the whole city was on the move. "Oberleutenant Vogt?" called a distant voice, grasping the Oberleutenant's attention as he came to see a young Leutenant saluting him. "At ease, Leutenant. You're here to bring me to my station, correct?" Vogt said. "Aye, sir, please, follow me, sir." prompting the young officer to face about and begin walking alongside Vogt. Everywhere Vogt looked, he only realized that the chaotic mess was growing, as dirtied Aryan settlers hurried to earn a few extra Reichsmarks whilst platoons of the Reichskommissariat's soldiers marched past. "Poor bastards never had it this hard, did they?" Vogt asked. "Not exactly, sir, preparations for a possible assault by the Russians has shaken up the lives of everyone in the settlement, though everyone is hopeful for the advisors that have come in." The prevalence of such "hope" did not appear evident for Vogt as he saw scared German children and fathers having to say one last goodbye before hurrying off with a rifle in tow. \n\nEventually, Vogt managed to escape the chaos-ridden frost as he entered his small office room within one of the military installations of Moskowien. To say that the ones present during the civil war in Germany were better was an overstatement, with staff tripping over themselves, rats scurrying down the hallways, and barely enough room to stand in. "Sir, command has issued that advisors are to aid in the training of divisions newly formed in the wake of the possible attack from the natives. Heil Speer." the Leutenant said, offering a salute in the air."

Breathe out. Fire. Reload, rinse, and repeat. Fix bayonets if the enemy got any closer. Had it not been that easy to operate the weapons left from the Second World War to prepare the Reichskommissariat for such an attack like this? Apparently fucking not, according to Vogt, given how this morning has gone so far. Fighting and killing fellow Germans felt easier than dealing with this catastrophe. \n\nIt was four in the morning when the battalion he had been assigned to start off with were finished lining up, with some of the men obviously not knowing what standing at attention meant. Lighting his cigarette, Vogt yelled out, "Men, my name is Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt. As I have seen blood spilt within our homeland through war, so too now do the Russians seek to spill our blood to retain their damned power, looking to unite against our families, our Fatherland! And as proud Germans seeking to do their homeland proud, we cannot allow this. Today begins your training for when you face the frontlines, in the reality of which some of you will die. However, that is not the concern now. Today, you shall become true workers of the Reichskommissariat, true soldiers, and true Germans. Now, first platoon of the first company, mount the firing range." \n\nVogt's inspiring words seemingly died in his eyes as the men lined up for weapon training. Some of these men hadn't touched a rifle in years, while others hadn't done so at all, and only worked the farms while producing large families, as the Reich had given permission to do so. None had known the true brutalities that were to come, as Vogt had seen during the civil war, especially when some of them barely figured out how to slide the bolt open. However, the worst came when the men had finally regularly begun firing at the targets when a shower of blood splattered across the field, some staining Vogt's coat, with screaming following. Men rushed over, and saw one that one of the recruits shot themselves in the hand, nearly blowing it off; however, despite the horrificness of the situation, the man managed to retain as much composure as he could, even firing off a joke or two in the process. \n\n Vogt knew the truth of the situation: the man shot himself in order to get out of service, in order to escape the horrors that everyone else was bound to endure. Yet, the Oberleutenant knew the truth of it all, that he couldn't shatter the mens' spirits knowing they had cowards in their ranks, and chose to send him away to deal with later. Afterwards, the men along the firing line simply stared at Vogt."

 speer_moskowien.37.d:0 "The Eagle, a bird of prey that overlooked the lands of the Germans for centuries. In times past, it represented the strength of the empires long past within German history, having served as a symbol of perseverance and courage. Now, as Vogt knew all too well, the symbol flew as to represent the Fatherland, along with the battalion of conscripts and volunteers within the newly formed "Adlersgruppe," charged with protecting their friends and families from the Russian onslaught that inevitably stormed its way forward. As the men continued setting up defenses in some backwater village to the south of Moskau, they continuously talked about potentially being called heroes on their return home. The word "hero" brought a whiplash of pessimism for Oberleutenant Vogt, nearly distracting him before the sounds of one of the infantrymen being torn apart by submachine gun fire exploded out. \n\nA period of shock-ridden silence boomed, until screams in Russian came from across the town, and the Germans hurried to their assigned positions, with Vogt's orders starting to become drowned out by the incoming gunfire. Chunks of concrete came flying off of surrounding buildings, some even tearing apart the faces of the new recruits, as they continually battled in the streets, with bullets flying and the blood of both Germans and Russians showering the air in a flurry of fire and gore. Vogt had known the terror of guerilla warfare for years, and now, as a Russian truck with a light-machine gun in the bed firing down into the Germans, Vogt had the chance to utilize his experience. With cries drowning the air, Vogt shouted at some of the closest men to him, "Find your strength men, now's our time to make the advance! Unteroffizier Breiner, take some men and gather the explosives! Unteroffizier Kranz, gather some men with me and we'll surround the truck, it cannot-" a bullet interrupted Vogt's speech as a rain of gunfire forced him to find better cover. As he regained his defense, the only thing the Oberleutenant saw when he laid his eyes on his men were the same emotions portrayed by his brothers-in-arms during their time fighting for Speer back in Germany. The same emotion that came as the feelings of heroism faded, and the chilling shadow of death crept closer and closer, with every comrade lost to another bullet, whether it's fired from a Russian or a German. \n\nTerror. \n\n Wiping his face some more, Oberleutenant Vogt shouted "Fall back, fall back! We'll find another way around!" as the German soldiers began to retreat in the face of the overwhelming firepower from the Russians. They may not be heroes, but they didn't need to be heroes to deserve to live another day, to Vogt, anyway."

The death, the destruction, the disease, and all the other terrors. But Vogt could never have expected the brutalities to rise so quickly: the amount of mass executions, the killings of deserters, those once considered to be comrades in fighting against the Russians, the viscera, all had come crashing down upon the volunteers in such a short period. Much to the respect of Oberleutenant Vogt, while it all seemed difficult, the men continued to march forward past it all; that is, until the Burning of Ryazan. \n\n As the Adlergruppe marched southwards from Moskau, pushing deeper into Russian territory "in the defense of the Reichs' rightful territory,'' the men had already become surrounded as the urban battle exploded. Sure, the men got their first taste of battle in a village, but this was an entirely different story as the concrete buildings and structures hid enemy Russians behind every corner. Constantly, squads of enemy soldiers seemed to appear as phantoms in the dark, pinning a few squads of the Germans down before they finally dealt with the issue. This was, until Alpha Company, led by Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt, entered the courtyard of an apartment complex to secure the area, and became pinned down by heavy enemy fire from all sides of the three-sided building. The men rushed to cover or died trying to do so, with the screams of fellow Aryans dying in the stony courtyard filling the air, as what seemed like the endless Russian supply of lead came raining hell upon the company. Vogt was left with no other choice but to hold out as he continuously pleaded for air support from local German air wings, who promised "immediate combat support." \n\nIt took a seemingly endless five minutes for the screams of the German jets to overtake the slaughter, as the Gates of Hell seemed to open up from the heavens above and consume the apartment complex. The men watched along in horror, some trying to get up and move as the fiery napalm they pleaded for arrived, sticking to the enemy soldiers who threw themselves off the multiple story balconies to escape the horrid fate of burning to death. However, as Vogt thought the horror was over, it only multiplied in size, as the outer doors of the apartment complex opened up and a flood of burning men, women, and children came screeching out of the complex. Only some had been armed, but none cared any longer, as they peeled away at the flesh and bone that melted away from the deadly German napalm, with mothers holding their children, hoping for an end to the madness. Eventually, all had either died from the flames or were killed out of mercy by some of those within the Aldersgruppe, who had all seemed to shock and terrified to be able to respond to any other orders from some of the superiors. \n\nThe nightmares that night consumed Vogt's mind. Flashbacks to that last stand at Bremen stormed his mind only to reach a burning conclusion, with the flooding of anachronistic burning children and women into the once-heroic battlefield, causing the Oberleutenant to rocket from his dreams every hour of the night."

All had such beautiful, loving wives, and even more beautiful children, in the eyes of Marina, always longing to start a family with her husband. Finally, the glowing numbers of "418" came into view with a screeching halt, and she excitedly danced over, finally seeing her beloved Marzell come into view. She immediately rushed to embrace her Marzell, who jumped at the sight of his rushing wife, causing her confusion, saying, "You're finally back, Marzell! Come here!" she said, embracing her husband. "Yes, I'm, I'm home now." Marzell said, as Marina felt her husband's hand shake. \n\nHours had gone by, and yet, the newly returning husband still remained...odd, according to Marina. Everytime a new question came forward, like, "How did it feel to serve the Fatherland once more?" he simply responded with a quick "It was good." or "Great." She couldn't name the look in his eyes, one of distance, as if his eyes were a camera out of focus, but she simply tried to provide everything she could to be a good wife. That evening, as the couple climbed into bed, Marina's attempts to embrace and comfort her husband resulted in a simple repulse on the side of her husband, followed by his attempts to get some sleep as he tossed and turned in the bed. \n\n Later into the night, Marina woke to the sound of broken glass and an otherwise empty bed, as she threw off the covers and rushed towards the kitchen, where she heard the loud noise. Realizing her husband was nowhere in sight, she grabbed a letter opener they kept on the desk before entering the kitchen...where she found her husband, with glass shards shattered across the table and ground, whiskey, which her husband swore to never drink in his career, spilled across the area, and a bloodied hand carrying a pistol kept from service. Marina dropped the letter opener on the ground as she approached her husband, asking "Marzell, oh god, what's wrong?" Marzell responded with nothing, only beginning to sob into her chest as he dropped the pistol on the ground, and embraced her tightly, shaking all the while."

And within one small compartment, the bustling and rocking of the powerful locomotive hardly shook the work Walther Viktorow had prepared. Viktorow sat excitedly, tapping on his briefcase filled with documents and procedural forms as he stared out into the Western Russian wilderness, completely losing track of the outside world as the train came to a screech, and the city streets filled his view. Finally, after so much wrongdoing against the harrowed Russian, Viktorow knew that the time had come to make a difference in the world, even if the greatest trial awaited him, and he had one thought which dominated his mind: \n\nMoskau awaits. \n\nHowever, as Viktorow exited the train, accompanied by a group of German guardsmen straight from Germania, the full force of the trial would strike as he looked around the train station. Everywhere, men, women, and children, all with bright, beautiful blue eyes, and adorned with flowing golden hair, all looked as if they had come from a German slum. Exhaustion colored their faces while callouses covered their hands, with some appearing frail and hungry, and all adorning ragged clothes that would bring disgust to most German higher ups. But Viktorow did not want the prestige or class of higher up, this is exactly what Viktorow wanted, even if he could not stand the pleading eyes of the settlers here. At the end of the day, they were the Reich's citizens, and as proud as they may be, they were suffering, and Viktorow knew that he, as an ambassador on behalf of the Reich itself, he could not allow this any longer. \n\nAs the snow landed atop his cap, the toy of a young child bounced across the street in front of the capitol, nearly prompting a guard to strike the child, were it not for Viktorow's intervention. Handing the child his toy from next to Viktorow's feet, the diplomat said a few simple words to the boy: "Do not be afraid, things will change here soon." as he looked onwards to the capitol building of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, as the recent clashings of Germans and Russians flooded his mind."

Improvements regarding the stability of the transportation systems between the Reich and the Reichskommissariat could potentially be looked into; however, if anything, the difficulty presented in the transportation systems is a small look into the situation within Moskowien. Politically, the situation within the area appears stable enough to not withdraw supply efforts towards the settlers of the area, nor do any reports indicate a collapse for the Reich's influence within the area around Moskau; however, living standards have fallen dramatically for the Aryan settlers within the Reichskommissariat as well as native Russians. Outbreaks of conflict between native Russian populaces and the settlers arriving from Germany proper has caused considerable detriment for German settlements, and Russians within the area have suffered as well, despite the advancements made within the area. In this regard, although living conditions have plummeted for all parties within Moscowien and the surrounding Russian nation-state, the populace has espoused supreme loyalty towards the Reich itself, and in an effort to support the German and the Russian within the area, the developing situation has been taken with the greatest priority for our diplomatic envoy. Thus, actions towards the advancement of OPERATION: GREATWHITE will begin immediate implementation within the interactions between Reichskommissar Kasche's successor, native leadership within the newly established state for Russians outside of Reichskommissar Moscowien, and the diplomatic envoy you have assigned me to, and transportation to the capital of the nation-state of the Russians will be arranged to aid our mutual efforts through a hopeful admittance into the Unity-Pakt.

Viktorow knew that as the days went on, the time before he'd venture forward to meet with the officials of the Russian nation grew shorter and shorter; yet, despite his excitement for the eventual departure and work, everything left him confounded in the reasoning behind the excitement. \n\n"Excuse me, Dr. Viktorow, but the convoy has been prepared for transportation." a young secretary said as he had missed her knocks on the door. "My apologies, Miss Berchow, right away." the diplomat said, as he grabbed his suitcase and followed her out. Everything around him had showcased what he enjoyed, the order, the structure of it all, and now was finally his time to make a difference. Time to make a difference that his predecessors of the past did not, he continued, thinking of the pictures of his family he kept so neatly tucked away back home in Germania. The carvings of the beautiful little box delighted Viktorow, in contrast with the contents, as he saw capturings of the times of a Russian family working its hardest to get through the wall set up by German forces. How great of suffering his grandparents had been as they crossed over into the new land of Germany, and the dreaded persecutions that the Viktorovs faced being foreign immigrants in a hostile land. But no more, no more crushed dreams nor broken souls from either side, as each and every hardworking German and Russian around Moskowien has earned their right to support from the Fatherland, and earned an end to the troubles which plagued them. \n\nViktorow continued his thoughts as he finally made it outside the capital alongside his fellow statesmen and the Waffen regiment accompanying them deep into the Russian land. The frost encapsulating the trucks reminded VIktorow of his grandfather and grandmother as the convoy began to move away from Moskowien territory."

As the entourage continued onwards, the silence slowly transformed from an excited admiration of the Russian land to a dreaded silence, with each rotation of the tires bringing another wave of confusing tensions as the Waffen guards present in Viktorow's truck prepped themselves. It was confusing to Viktorow, to say the least, until the trucks finally passed through the iron gates of the city. \n\nThere, peering through the windows of a heavily armored truck, Viktorow, for the first time in his life, received a glimpse as to what his grandmother and grandfather escaped all those years ago: the glimpses of children roaming the streets without parents in sight, in rags, fighting over a piece of bread which had been stained by the mud of the ground. Across the street, Viktorow caught glimpses of three men beating another fellow Russian on the ground, pummeling him with bats, punches, and kicks as they strip him of his bag and coat and duck off into the alleyway, passing by a duo of nurses carrying a body covered with a tarp out of a health center. The homeless had grown in number as he saw groups of armed men harassing a young woman coming out of her home, seemingly asking for overdue money owed to them, and Viktorow could only pray for her safety as the convoy moved on. Viktorow continued to think and debate with himself as to what had become the fate of the Russian people, what could have done this? Were the politicians in charge of the state that greedy, or was there some sort of crisis causing all of this? Viktorow continued to pray for the hope that things had not been completely this way for his ancestors. \n\nAs the motorcade came to a halt outside of the capitol building, Viktorow continued to dust himself off and grab his briefcase as his eyes locked onto a peculiar sight: a little girl, no older than seven, grabbed at the chain link fence as she continued to stare at the Germans inside. She looked thinly, and had only dirty rags on, yet her brown eyes glimmered in the snow, reminding Viktorow of the daughter he always wanted.

The desperateness and near predatory nature of some of the groups that had formed outside of the Moskowien territory, how could the self-governed area fall apart so quickly, yet the room he sits in remain so lavish? \n\nSuddenly, the wrinkled face of the anti-Soviet himself, Bronisalv Kaminski entered the room, offering a nod and handshake to the diplomat. "Brigadeführer Kaminski, it is an honor to meet you, my name is Dr. Walther Viktorow-" Viktorow said, before being cut off by Kaminski, who stated, "Ah, the diplomat sent by Speer, huh? We've been waiting for the day of your arrival, what's the terms?" Viktorow hadn't pictured such exhaustion from Kaminski, but then again, all of the area has been a surprise, hasn't it? Taken aback, Viktorow took out the first report in the file, and began discussing the Führer's desires out of Kaminski to pay for the incredible amount of support issued issued to the native state via the ceding of Brauchitschstadt and a swearing of loyalty to the Unity-Pakt. Viktorow's seemingly hopeful words brought him to look up, only to meet the image of Kaminski hunched over the desk, both hands clasping his face, with only whispers to be heard between Viktorow's relaying message: "They'll march in and hang me...joining the Unity-Pakt....the natives, they've given..." And finally, as if a sledgehammer broke through a castle made of sand, everything came together for Viktorow. The terms, the ceding of territory, the governmental lavishness, yet the hopeless and the butchers remaining outside, this wasn't Kaminski's misdoings, they've been paying everything towards the Reich for all the aid they received at first. They couldn't stand on their own, they needed help, and now...wait, Operation: Great White. Viktorow wasn't serving as a negotiator here, he was a predator: a loan shark. \n\nIn the end, Kaminski, with eyes that seemingly had the life sucked out of them, shook to the agreement of losing Brauchitschstadt and joining the Pakt. With every step, from leaving the capital building, to walking to the trucks, to staring out the windows as they rumbled out, Walther Viktorow felt one thing alone: the eyes of starving, broken Russians."

Meeting with BRONISALV KAMINSKI retained success within the notions outlined in OPERATION: GREATWHITE, as the native state has agreed to cede Brauchitschstadt to the direct control of the German Reich while issuing a submittance of willingness to joining the Unity-Pakt in support of Germany proper in exchange for the cancellation of debts owed from the local government towards Germania. German settlers retained celebratory feelings over the success and technical end to conflicts against their Russian neighbors, as local reports showed demonstrations of praise regarding the Reichskommissariat's government. Outside of Moskau, reports of Russian citizens' outrage over the terms of KAMINSKI'S agreement have been issued to local media outlets, with even some factions within Brauchitschstadt reporting direct obstinance towards the notions of direct annexation by the German Reich proper. Overall tension within the area remains to be seen, as continuous data has been feeding into the Reichskommissariat's office to measure the success of the terms. Within personal reason and experience, it is within bounds of my personal measures to report that OPERATION: GREATWHITE provides immediate successes for the German Reich; however, continuous documentation will be required to measure long-term successes. Insofar as measurements reach, the continuous losses of the native populaces following the Second World War, the Western Russian War, and now the loss of Brauchitschstadt and the diplomatic alignment with the Unity-Pakt may offer a fostering point for native resistances.

A pound on the door outside his office served as the fifteenth reminder that day that the world after Hitler was still a chaotic maelstrom of politics and blood, a great typhoon in which Germania was the eye of the storm. Peaceful for now, but surrounded by disorder on all sides. \n\n"Come in, come in." \n\n"Foreign minister, a report from Moskowien. I'm sure you'll find it fascinating reading." \n\n"Thank you. You're one of Gehlen's boys, with the RND?" \n\nThe young man opposite him remained silent, and smiled coldly. Schmidt internally rolled his eyes and took the paper from him. "Very well. Off you go then." \n\nWith a short bow, the man left. Schmidt stared at the paper in front of him. 'Kaminski victorious', a newspaper clipping on the front read. Ah, so old Brinislaw had won out against the German settlers. A bad situation for Germany, perhaps, what with the whole legacy of a totalitarian Reichkomissariat and all leaving a sour taste in Russian mouths. Still, Schmidt thought it was perhaps preferable to Von Dem Bach or one of the other wretched Nazis patrolling the ruins of Russia. If not for his government, then for humanity as a whole. \n\nHe filed through the papers, and one stood out particularly. An intercepted telegram, between one of Brinislaw's men and some sympathetic Russian national in Lettland. Now this was interesting. Seems Kaminski had become convinced the best way for his Moscow autonomy out of the chaos enveloping the rest of Russia was a negotiation session with Germania's finest. Perhaps Schmidt would see the best of both worlds, then."

Russian troops lined the streets, eying down the foreign minister's convoy as it moved toward the central bar, which had seemingly been refitted into a political centre of operations for Kaminski's forces in this region. Schmidt was confident that he was safe; the Heer around him was equipped with better weapons than these peasant conscripts, that was for sure. Either way, blood spilled today would not be the preferable option. \n\nNegotiations were over lunch. Shashlik, Pelmeni and even Chicken Kiev. Schmidt didn't have Russian cuisine often, but it remained one of his favourites on the continent. Beyond the food, Schmidt was impressed with Kaminski. The man spoke German well, and seemed cultured in literature and philosophy, something that even in the supposed 'world capital' politicians often lacked. The man's taste was clearly in the sciences, however, but Schmidt was capable of holding basic conversation on the scientific feats of Tesla through to Braun. Schmidt liked Kaminski, and it seemed the favour was mutual. \n\nA minor tremor in the conversation was felt. Schmidt let it be known that Brauchitschstadt, or what the Russians still call 'Leningrad', would be directly administered by Germania. The city seemed to hold sentimental value to the old soldier opposite him, who had served his time with the Red Army before Stalin's purges. Lenin was still an admired figure. \n\nDespite this, Kaminski was still willing for the negotiations to move forward.

"Perhaps the Heer might take an advisory role in the new Moscow government, if you would be so willing." \n\n"I heard what you said the first time, I was just checking to see if you were the rat you appeared to be."

That you might be an angel on Speer's shoulder, and you might do something genuinely good for Russia, or even the world." \n\nSchmidt watched as the man opposite him stood from his unfinished lunch. Kaminski faced away, equipping his coat as he continued. "No man is immune to propaganda.

My blood might come from Warsaw, Minsk, and the very soil this building stands on, but do you think just because I am a Slav that I am stupid?" \n\n"Take yourself and those uptight pricks in uniform behind you back to whatever fucking hell you came from." Kaminski's glare penetrated Schmidt, and the Russians left the room. Schmidt slammed the table once the door had shut. War had come again."

Send my best wishes back to the RND with you." \n\nThe young man saluted, and exited the room. Speer was left with a folder of documents pertaining to the breakdown of the recent partition in Moskowien. Ah. Erich von dem Bach has claimed victory, or so the clipping at the front of the folder would have the Führer believe. Perhaps his Cyrillic was a bit rusty, but flicking through the rest of the documentation suggested that this was the accurate outcome. \n\n"Finally, some good news," Speer muttered to himself. A loyal Wehrmacht general sat in Moscow now, and the Führer could see no reason why resistance was even conceivable. He picked the phone up from his desk. \n\n"

As good a place as any for diplomatic arrangements. Perhaps more importantly, Erich von dem Bach hadn't seen his hometown for years, and so Schmidt thought it might be beneficial to arrange a meeting there. The bewildered old soldier was guided by the foreign minister into the party office building that  had been reserved for the meeting. A table was decorated with a grand lunch for Moskowien's interim ruler. Wurst, potatoes and plenty of beer. "Schmidt, this was unnecessary. Thank you." \n\n"Anything for a fellow German on the homebound flight. Now, down to business?" \n\nAt Bach's nod, Schmidt began. With an apology, the foreign minister revealed that Bach's position would be filled by Alexis von Roenne, to which Bach was seemingly compliant. Additionally, the Reich would directly occupy Brauchistschstadt, and create a new german settler state in the Southern Volga region. To both of these territorial changes, Bach was quite amicable. "Happy to do my duty, sir." \n\nSchmidt smiled to himself. If he knew this was going to be so easy, he would've started drinking much earlier."

Schmidt thought he'd have hated Bach, but the man was honest and kind. They had been alone for some time, and Bach admitted his Kashubian heritage, which no one in the party, he was sure, knew. Sometimes, in Bach's weaker moments, even he doubted the party. Schmidt felt he had met a kindred spirit. The deal was sealed with signatures, and the men departed home. \n\nSchmidt didn't like night time flights, so he was staying in Lauenburg til the morning. He sat up in his hotel bed with the folder the RND had given him. It was a dossier on Bach, and although he had considered the diplomatic sections with great detail, he had only skimmed the personal section. Schmidt's eyebrows furrowed as he glanced over a section tabbed as 'Activities before Moskowien', detailing the man's actions before the war. Schmidt felt his heart race. The man he had joked and drunk with just hours earlier had been responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents, and these were only the documented ones. In Operation Hummingbird, Bach had personally killed several in the SA. Then there was his horrific career in the SS, which Schmidt had heard of but never actively considered. \n\nNo one in this Reich was innocent. Not even the kindest of faces, or the warmest of voices. It was just Schmidt, and Schmidt alone, dancing with the murderers that had destroyed his father's country. He felt his eyes begin to tear up, but suppressed the urge to cry. He had done too much of that recently. At least the deal had gone smoothly. Another nation returned to the Unity Pakt for his favourite murderer, the Führer."

The host complimented the scientists on their results, expressing his "great appreciation" for the progress made in the fields of electronics and industry, of engineering and military. "With your keen intellect and your selfless dedication to the Reich" he stated in a speech at the end of the banquet, "you not only ensure the Vaterland's greatness and the continuation of the dream of National Socialism, which should already be a satisfying reward for true patriots such as yourselves.

At one point, the Führer interrupted the barrage: "Minister, please stop! Are we truly in such a state? Has the Reich really fallen behind so much?"\n"Please come with me mein Führer"\nAs the two moved to the window, the Minister pointed at the cars: "Do you recognise them?" and that was enough answer. To his consternation, Speer saw that most, if not all cars and trucks passing were models ten - if not more - years old. Looking with more attention, he also noticed details he had missed when looking outside in the past weeks: patchwork reparations to the roads and sidewalks, electric cables hanging from scrambled-together power lines, public phones scattered because the people had no telephones inside their homes...\n\nRight at that moment, as if to confirm that indeed, the situation was dire, all lights went out in the office, and the surprised voices from outside the door made it clear that it was a general blackout. The Führer fumbled around to his desk, suddenly dejected, and sighed. "Please resume your report, Minister..."

By their expressions and the excited comments, one would think they resembled children waiting their turn to enter a bakery shop, and in a way, they indeed were.\n\nA large machine stood in the middle of the room, towering over the assembled people. At human level, a small screen and a keyboard were encased in the metal: the screen had nothing on it, but soon it would change. In a very similar room in Germania, the central hub of NetzRAM had been activated, and the network spanning the entirety of the Reich was officially active. In a few moments, a message would arrive from the main device, and the results of this first test would show whether the experiment had been a resounding success or a humiliating failure.\n\nThe screen buzzed with life, and everyone almost turned into a giraffe trying to look at the screen: letter after letter... it appeared! "WHAT IS YOUR NAME?" Cheers erupted across the room, and with trembling hand, the University dean answered: "WALTHER BOTHE". Another few seconds, then a second message: "WHAT IS YOUR QUEST?" to which the agreed-upon answer: "TO FURTHER SCIENCE". Finally, the third and last: "WHAT IS THE AIRSPEED VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SWALLOW?"\n\nSilence fell in the room. This wasn't the correct question! Was there a problem? A bug? A... hacker?!

The first, critically, is the Antifachistische Aktion. Being one of the most vocal opponents of National Socialism, they were purported as 'exterminated' under the leadership of Führer Adolf Hitler, but unfortunately we have been mistaken. We know little of them yet, so uncovering their degenerative Bolshevik roots is important.\n\nSecondly, is the exponential ramp-up of the student movement in Germany. We have firm reason to believe that, while they are backed by Antifa, they form the backbone of the reformist movement in Germany. With this, a double-pronged problem has been formed.

"Your mission will be as follows:\n\nAt [redacted] past midnight, you will infiltrate past the security in the house. You will be given significant amounts of explosives, and you will need to plant them across several weak points throughout the house.

Of course it was necessary. Anything else would not be tolerated, but now the state had to deal with the fall-out that followed. At the very least it wasn't as bad as he may have initially thought, but seeing every day pop up with another article about how some pushy college student affiliated with Antifa was arrested by the men in black.

It was plain in sight, clear as day, black as night!.\n\nBut when he showed up to protest at his college that afternoon, most of his colleagues weren't around with him.

One of the Antifa members decided to pull ahead of their group and begin shouting. "Klaus Becker!" He shouted, and one of the students raised their hand, moving forward. "We're told your father is a veteran pilot in the Luftwaffe, and that you vote for the NSDAP. Are both of these things true?"\n\nThe silence was unpleasant. It was broken, however, when Klaus let out a laugh. "Who told you THAT?! My Opa is a retired electrician, and I've never touched a ballot in my life! Goodness... if you don't believe me, I'll be happy to show you my father's certificate!" That chipped off some of Antifa's initial weariness, and as more students were asked, more of these nonsensical facts were debunked.

Starting shortly on the afternoon, the students gathered up at campus to rally against the Government's policies. As they were marching up and down the streets, waving around signs of degenerate counter-culture and generally making a mess of the place, another element appeared! The vicious Antifa, commonly known to aid these protests against the brave police force set to keep the peace and calm, came down like vultures on a corpse!\n\nTestimonies from the students say that they could hear these Antifa members shout various obscenities, as well as making claims that they were "in cahoots with the fascists", that "your parents are in Nazi pockets", and that "you don't care about true freedom". Clearly, neither did Antifa, as several students were left with severe bruising, with one even having to be rushed to the hospital! This is a shameful day for all Germans, and we can only hope that the people shall learn about the terrible truths that have plagued this incessant Antifa ever since their origins.For any Germans near and far, let it be known! Even if you attempt to go against the government, in the eyes of the Bolsheviks, you are nothing but a so-called "puppet"! Their measures are too extreme, too radicalized, too out-of-line with true German ideology, and so they will strike at any weakness!\n\n - The Arbeitertum, your first and most quality source for anything related to labor. - "

Ever since he heard the news about that incident with a chapter of Antifa, he grabbed at his nervousness and almost decided against going to the meeting today. Still, he had to meet with Elsa Fechner, the effective head of the student protesters in this university, or he'd do his own chapter a major disservice.\n\nStepping into the cool, open halls of the school, he spotted Elsa with a few other students, talking to each other before she turned her gaze to him. He moved to talk to her, and she merely waved her hand dismissively as she approached. "I don't want to deal with you anymore, Leon."\n\n"Elsa..." He trailed off, already feeling sweat forming on his head. "Don't do this. We're not affiliated with that chapter-" She gave him a stern glare, and the other two students backed off. "I know you're not. I don't care. I'm not risking the legitimacy of our movement by associating with you. Even if such an incident would never occur between us, what do you think the students here want?" Her eyes softened, and she looked away. "Just go." Hesitation creeped up her throat, but she threw it back down. "Tell your chapter we're no longer allied with each other. A lot of our students have turned against Antifa, and I can't convince them otherwise."\n\nPainful silence came from Leon, and he swallowed, opening his mouth to say something before he stopped whatever he wanted to say. "No... I... alright. That's fine. W-we'll be fine. I... hope you do well without us." She looked up towards Leon and gave him a demoralized, pained look."

Especially as you decided to focus on Antifa, rather than the students." Wessel quietly raised an eyebrow at the comment. What was it about the students that he was so dissuaded by? "Thankfully, no blood of our agents has been spilled, and Antifa's popularity has dropped like a rock. The problem, however..."\n\nHe readjusted himself in his seat and reached in for a map he pulled out from under his desk. It was a map of Germany and its cities, with several being marked with red circles. "These are suspected Antifa strongholds." He exclaimed, tapping on one of the major cities. "Now... the reason why I say suspected and not are is because, well..."\n\n"Their popular support dropping means that they must switch tactics." Wessel plainly said, and nodded, and Gehlen raised an eyebrow at him. "I am aware. It will make infiltration more difficult, though it will simultaneously be easier to justify getting rid of them."\n\nGiving a second of pause, Gehlen proceeded to give the lightest of smiles. "Good, good. You're already getting a grasp of the situation." Wessel wondered if he was the one who just got a handle on the situation, but perished the thought. "Then I believe I needn't tell you more." Showing a hand, Wessel returned it and both shook strongly. "Germany is always under our watchful gaze, Herr Wessel." Gehlen said. "Don't forget that.

The object of their trafficking, however, is forbidden literature: thousands of outlawed books from the United States and Canada have been smuggled into the Reich through Brittany.

As the kettle of tension boiled, all it took was three squeezes of a finger to turn the situation into a disaster, as a certain Josef Bachmann, what would be another teenager joining students, shot one of the student leaders identified by the RND, Rudi Dutschke. The first bullet entered between the shoulder and throat, pushing Dutschke back before the second bullet struck, travelling along the side of Dutscke's skull and brain before the final shot tore straight into Dutscke's head, sending a splattering of blood and brain matter across the students as he fell, dead. \n\nWith a section of the guards attacking Bachmann, and Dutscke dead in the arms of his student comrades, chaos reigned.

However, in addressing the events of the rally for the Reichsparteitag der Macht at Nuremberg, we must recognize a certain degree of failure amidst ourselves and our department in the handling of what happened, and our preparations for a potential conflict. Now, it is our duty to ensure that we can resolve what happened, and where to go from here." Wessel said, as his men looked around, uncomfortable. For the next hour, Wessel scorned them, ensuring each and every one that they would be responsible in the investigation of the incident, now that the world is watching them. \n\n"Herr Gehlen, I'm hoping this is a sufficient hour for you, sir."

Bachmann's still in custody, and, quite frankly, we need to find out why he shot Dutschke, what if someone's backing him?" Wessel said. Gehlen took a long drag of his cigar, looking at his desk, before uttering with a puff of smoke, "What makes you think anyone else is involved? Could be some fucked up kid after all." "It just doesn't make sense, he's a young kid, small criminal record, doing day jobs, why on Earth would he shoot a political ideologue?" Wessel responded. With a chuckle, Gehlen said, "Huh, well, if you ask me, some of those lowlifes can get all wrapped up in the SS's business, when there's nowhere to gun, men run to the occult. I'd start your search there." Wessel was taken aback, the Ordenstaat? Would they really bother shooting a student leader, just for disagreeing? While doubt rushed to his head about Gehlen's statement, he was interrupted by a young intelligence officer slamming open the door, with an urgent look in his eyes. \n\nJosef Bachmann was found hanged in his cell.

Wessel, a skilled and experienced investigator, knew that the answers lied within the body, within Bachmann. And yet, everytime he approached the idea, bureaucratic shifts of resources and reorganizations of priorities for the department swept up any attempts. \n\nThe ever-recurring wall of smoke hit Wessel like a wave, only to calm back down and reveal the face of his ever-diligent superior. "Good evening, Herr Gehlen." Wessel greeted. "The same to you, Wessel. Now, a late hour in the night, coming into my office, what's pricked your mind tonight?" Gehlen responded. "Well, Herr Gehlen, I just have some, well, issues in the Nuremberg investigation, but I believe I have a solution. You see, I understand your hypothesis; however, it appears too convenient, or even that we may have overlooked pieces attached to Bachmann that could lead further in any direction. Nevertheless, I believe a formal reinvestigation of Bachmann's body could allow for some, well, advances. Unfortunately, the proposal has been shut down due to other matters of the office becoming, well, randomly prioritized, and I believe we need to focus the investigation." Gehlen said, squashing the cigar against the ashtray on his desk. "Bachmann had clear ties to Burgundian authorities, it's as clear as day upon the man's very clothes. You wish to tell me that it could somehow be something completely different? We have many things to worry about in the RND, reopening a closed case is not one of them, Wessel."

This wasn't right, not at all. Lifting his office phone, Wessel said, "Wedekind...Kessler...to my office, please." \n\nThus, a plan was hatched.

Do either of you wish to do this?" With the men's eerie silence, and constant stares at Wessel, an understanding agreement was made, and the bag was unzipped to reveal the products of the break-in.

However, the most damning piece of information dawned in the mind of Gerhard Wessel: Heinz Felfe had been in Kyiv for a criminal autopsy. \n\n"Someone forged these documents." Wessel said, in shock. The two men nodded, Kessler burning through a cigarette in the meantime. "Someone is throwing off this entire investigation. Someone powerful." The questioned remained however: should he intend to pursue whoever is throwing everything off, or would it just lead to their deaths?"

 speer_rnd.49.t:0 "The Devil's in the Details"
 speer_rnd.49.d:0 "Gerhard Wessel spent his waking hours and nights of supposed sleep investigating Wedekind and Kessler's findings. What should have been time to see friends, loved ones, or co-workers, instead was spent looking at photos of a dead gunman, and a counterfeit autopsy supposedly performed by a man hundreds of miles away. And yet, the documents kept showing more and more proof for Wessel. \n\nAs he stared at the documents, rushes and waves of doubt filled Wessel's mind, as the typically astute, focused, and efficient man turned inwards to paranoia and fear. The man who fought so diligently beside him, as a father, Reinhard Gehlen, and yet his name was plastered all over the investigation, whilst his words covered falsified information and throw offs from the main investigation. Was it true Gehlen? No, it couldn't be, this man was loyal to the Reich, why would he throw things off for a genuinely efficient information bureau that had trusted him dearly? Wessel's minds wandered throughout the worries and doubts of the world, as his entire career up to this point became jeopardized with the notions working in the midst of treachery, while other times it proceeded to become laser-focused on the difficult matter in front of him, looking for any potential leads and openings into this dreadful case of treachery and dangers around every corner. Suddenly, the familiar smoky odor alerted Wessel as he put away the material into his desk and Reinhard Gehlen came in. \n\n"Good afternoon, Wessel. Here, you got some departmental mail regarding last month's procedures and some ways we're looking to improve, figure you may have some worthwhile input, after all." Gehlen said, flashing a smile at his subordinate before leaving. Wessel's tired, sunken eyes could hardly stand any more bureaucracy, when his hands ran along the curious material of the rubber stamp attached to the envelope. That's when an idea hatched in Wessel's mind, and he cleared through his desk to gather the documents, and each of their attached envelopes. Each had a similar rubber stamp, in fact, on closer inspection and magnification, Wessel realized they were all the same: the stamp of Horst Wendland, Vice President of the RND."

 speer_rnd.50.d:0 "Cologne is a bustling and prosperous city with a rich culture -  if your definition of a rich culture was one not torn down by the NSDAP. It would make for a pleasant vacation, but that's not what Wessel was here for. In fact, one of the first sights he saw when he was there was students spilling out from a street corner, chanting vague insults and protests against the government; he and his fellow agents, however, simply passed by them. They were not the focus.\n\nThis was where Horst Wendland made his base of operations for the day, and Wessel received quite the good news about the state of it. At some point in the afternoon, Wendland was scheduled to have dinner with one Hermann Ludke, an admiral in the Kriegsmarine. Why an admiral and the vice president of the RND met up was unknown to him, but he had his musings on the matter. Still, he wasn't here to spy on them. In fact, quite the opposite.\n\nIn Germany's decadence, many officials slacked on caring about having paranoia-levels of security wherever they went. Wessel had fully expected Wendland to be just like his superior, but clearly he was mistaken. And thankfully so, otherwise this would've been a fruitless endeavour. A report was leaked to Wessel and his team, brief and to the point. Wendland's main documents were stored in an apartment on the other side of the city, and that the only real security was the hotel staff. Something that his crackshot agents could easily get through."

 speer_rnd.51.t:0 "Hands In The Gaps"
 speer_rnd.51.d:0 "They struck gold. Not only did they arrive just in time, as Wendland seemingly exited the apartment only an hour prior, but the security in the hotel was particularly lax. So lax, in fact, that one of Wessel's agents managed to sneak straight into the entrance. With short radio telecommunications at hand, the agent was slowly guided to the room Wendland had made himself comfortable in, and, after dodging another guard and spending about ten seconds picking the lock to his room, he was in.\n\nThe agent quickly found out that something was off. A large, black object was hidden in the corner of the room, draped in clothing and backed behind a chair, but anything above a passive glance could tell that it didn't belong there. Remembering how the clothes were originally placed, the agent took them off and uncovered... a safe. After relaying this information, some surprise was felt from Wessel's side, but it quickly faded away as he considered his options. There were two, each with their pros and cons.\n\nThe first was to simply bug the system. Wendland was not a very competent nor careful person in Wessel's eyes, so he highly doubted that he would spot that his safe was bugged. It would give easy access to whatever was heard inside his room, though the contents of the safe itself would not be directly uncovered to him.\n\nThe second was to blow the damn thing open and run like hell. It would throw all caution out of the window and make Wendland certain that he knew someone was tracking him, but as long as the contents inside are worth it, the reward would outweigh the risk."

 speer_rnd.52.d:0 "With the agent who bugged the safe, Wessel stood in his office and prepared the audio recorder to playback the important part that they managed to get out after an entire day of searching through what was spoken. Tapping the button, Wessel kept his ears sharp.\n\n"... Oh yeah, and one last thing. There's that place I wanted to empty out. What?"\n"..."\n"No, not that. The other one. The... the warehouse." A few seconds of silence followed by an audible sigh. "No. Alright, I'm talking about that specific warehouse, alright? The one I asked you to clear out days ago, but you still haven't gotten around to doing it. What's that?"\n"..."\n"I see. That doesn't matter now. I'm giving you the order again - the warehouse. Tell some of your agents to move the files somewhere else by the end of the week. Yes, tell them to go to Leverkusen, and-"\n\nLetting go of the button, Wessel looked up at the agent. "And that's all that's important?" He asked, and the other man nodded. Wessel stood up to his full height and gave the man a a brief nod back. "I want our agents set out immediately - preferably by airplane. We don't know how much time is left on our hands, and whatever is in that warehouse is important. You are dismissed.""
 speer_rnd.52.a:0 "With a crisp salute, the man left the room and Wessel to his scattered thoughts."

 speer_rnd.53.t:0 "Perhaps Too Well"
 speer_rnd.53.d:0 "Wessel had decided to personally visit the warehouse in the day leading up to the trip. He himself wasn't certain why, but he simply had a desire to see it with his own eyes. Thankfully, the entire process was far less troublesome than any pessimistic expectation he had. There were no dramatic encounters, only an empty warehouse with even emptier contents. It took them ten whole minutes of searching before they found something. In a boarded-up room, one of Wessel's agents found a table with documents and tape recorders.\n\nInitially he sent an agent to examine it, but after just a minute he returned to Wessel and told him something that stopped him in his tracks and made his ever-professional facade break for a moment. Asking the agent to guide him to the room, Wessel was left alone with the contents on the table, now laid out at his disposal.\n\nHe played one tape recorder, then another, then another. They all played back the same voice. His own professional demeanor reverberating back at him. And occasionally, another voice joined in.\n\nGehlen's- and the contents of these discussions were all about Büro Wessel and its activities. Something beyond Wendland's reach. This was no petty crime, and as Wessel left the room, his mind began stirring. It was impossible that Gehlen let his vice president run amok so freely, taping conversations. Even for a man as bizarre as his superior, he didn't consider him to be that incompetent - and so the worry in his mind refused to go away as he and his agents abandoned the warehouse and wiped any trace of their presence clean."

 speer_rnd.54.d:0 "He hadn't remembered how long it had been since he had done something like this. For the past few days Büro Wessel, from an outsider's perspective, looked like it was in a state of disarray. Wessel himself, however, knew the machinations of bureaucracy. He prepared orders, he scouted locations, he made sure that the points were covered and that the loopholes were closed. There was nowhere for this insubordinate to go. Nowhere to run. All the secrets that Wendland had been hiding from him would be revealed, whether he wanted to or not.\n\nAt the crack of twilight, Wessel stood tall, facing down the stoic gazes of about seven agents, all looking at him, all betraying no emotion on their face. "Today, you will spend the entire day searching for a single man in this city. We've put down a few locations, and you will each visit them together. Do not separate, do not stand out, do not hesitate. Your goal is to do only one thing, and I expect you to succeed with haste." They all gave sharp salutes in tandem with each other, Wessel nodding once.\n\n"With my authorization, Horst Wendland is now considered a wanted man in Germany and its subsidiary territories. The charges are treason, insubordination, and conspiracy against the state. Do you all understand?" He asked, and to that the men responded with a "Sir, yes, sir!""
 speer_rnd.54.a:0 "Find Horst Wendland and arrest him at once - dismissed!"

 speer_rnd.55.d:0 "The explosion that rocked the room and was heard throughout the whole building sent the skeleton security team into overdrive, but miraculously enough, the agent for the job managed to slip by and escape with the contents of the safe. By that night, they were laid out in front of a table, Wessel himself looking over what was stolen from Wendland. He only wished that blowing their cover - literally, in fact - would have been worth it.\n\nPapers and files, cases and documents. All things Wessel handled gently, but all things that served no purpose to him in the end. They were all about other things not related to the Büro Wessel, or Antifa, or the student protests. Frustration that was present in his mind only grew throughout the night, until after about half an hour of searching, there was nothing.\n\nExcept the one thing yet to be researched. There was an undeveloped roll of film, waiting to be explored. With only one avenue left, Wessel pursued it with intent to find out if this whole operation wasn't just a waste of time."
 speer_rnd.55.a:0 "Perhaps there is a silver lining in all of this..."

 speer_rnd.56.t:0 "Cut Through The Fog"
 speer_rnd.56.d:0 "The few days Wessel had to wait were painful days. There could have been quite possibly anything on that film, ranging from the most trite, pointless things completely unrelated to what he was doing to... things he didn't want to waste his time thinking about. After all, it was only the results that mattered.\n\nAnd the results eventually came. In his office, he was handed the developed film by an agent of his who hadn't looked at it, and then promptly left the office, leaving the man by himself. From the top, he uncovered his thumb to look at the first picture of the set, and...\n\nWessel felt his heart drop. On the first picture - the very first - there was an image, clear as day, of something being pictured against a wooden table. On a closer glance, he could make out the markings and the design. This was no ordinary document. This was a document that belonged to the Büro Wessel. Then another picture - this time it was open, revealing its incredibly damaging contents inside. While his face was stoic, his mind was in a whirl. Drawn in by the shock, he looked at another image, then another, then another.\n\nBy the end, it had been a long time since Wessel felt such anger brewing in him. But it was driven with a purpose."

 speer_rnd.57.d:0 "The sight of Wessel standing in front of Wendland's cell gave him endless shivers. He was not appreciative of the man's cold, empty, fury-filled stare, not at all. When he eventually spoke, Wendland nearly jumped out of his skin. "Don't waste my time, Horst." Wessel almost snarled. "I want you to answer a few simple questions for me." Wendland backed away, his face already paling. "N-no, wait, what do y-you mean by 'simple questions'?" He asked back, and Wessel merely stared at him further.\n\n"What reason did you have for taking pictures of top-secret documents belonging to the Büro Wessel?" His was a voice of stone, betraying nothing, but those familiar with it could make out the invisible intricacies. The purest sense of anger. Wendland only managed to stutter a few meaningless words before Wessel cut him off sharply. "Full sentences. Scattered words do not answer my question."\n\n"I... I c-can't tell you! If I-- if I did, I'd-I-I wouldn't-" Wessel loudly sighed. "Next question." His eyes narrowed even further. "How did you manage to take these pictures? You are--were, under the direct oversight of Reinhard Gehlen." Something was implicated in his words, and Wendland's eyes widened. "No... no, don't ask me that! Don't ask me that!" He yelled, and Wessel's posture refused to change as he spoke. "Who were your associates, Wendland? If you can't answer that, I'll have to pass you on to my other agents."\n\nHe backed up behind a wall, and kept his hands tight on the uncomfortable bed below him. Tremors ran down his limbs, and he couldn't help to stop the incessant shaking of his head, telling him to look away. "God, no, please, I can't-I don't..." He trailed off, and Wessel raised an eyebrow. Would he finally speak? He was almost about to feel some relief when Wendland suddenly shut his eyes tight and made a strange noise akin to a grunt and a gasp, as his head rolled back. When Wessel saw that, his stance broke, and he muttered the slightest 'no' before shouting an order for his agents to come over."

Gehlen's desk put them almost at opposite ends of the room, yet Wessel kept his voice low regardless. "Felfe had indeed infiltrated Chornovil's group, and was aware of my presence in Ukraine, but he had no intentions of ever contacting me. He was killed in a firefight with another group - mercenaries of some sort." \n\nReinhard took a drag of his cigarette. The corners of his mouth tightened ever so slightly. "And you thought it necessary to attempt to contact him, to risk his mission, a mission your Büro had no part in? For all you know, you led these men right to him." \n\n"No. This was a coordinated, pre-planned attack. I was lucky to even see him alive." Wessel noticed the smallest twitch as Gehlen responded. \n\n"You spoke with him?"\n\nCurious. "No. But I overheard enough. He was a double agent. He had been feeding them information ever since he joined. Why?" \n\nReinhard leant over the desk and ground his cigarette into the crystal ashtray. "You seem to forget who is debriefing whom, Herr Kätzchen." Gerhard internally grimaced at the all-too forced codename. "I do not like what you imply. Felfe was a traitor, and his treachery caught up with him." He looked pointedly at Wessel. "You are not privy to the details of every operation this organisation performs. I suggest you get used to that fact." \n\n"Verflitzes Kätzchen" glowered, though his face remained a mask of patience. As he wished. If "Kleiner Fuchs" wanted to play his cards close to his chest, so could he. He would stay in his lane - but where his Büro's lane went was his business."

He remained deathly silent as his number two agent spoke. "Agent Kleiner Fuchs," he began, betraying nothing but the slightest annoyance. "These," he continued, pointing fingers at the pictures in front of Gehlen. They were... damaging, to say the least. Proof that Wendland had taken pictures of top secret info that only Wessel's agency would have access to. "What are these, sir? How did the vice-president of the RND get these images? Not only that, he committed suicide via a cyanide pill when questioned about it."\n\nGehlen, after a long period of silence that only served to further annoy Wessel, sighed. "Agent Verflitzes Kätzchen..." He began, pushing the pictures towards him slightly. "These questions shouldn't concern you. They should concern me." He said, voice tightening slightly. "I know the trigger for his suicide. When you asked him about who these pictures were for, correct?" At that, Wessel's breathing became just a bit heavier. "Are you looking for something, Agent... ? A sort of... conspiracy, perhaps?"\n\n"Sir." Wessel returned, staring with an attempt to scan Gehlen's emotions. They were not pleasant. "I am not making any claims. I just want to find out why Wendland took these pictures, and why he committed suicide. If I can get the help of the RND..." Gehlen shook his head. "No, no, no. Agent, you misunderstand. I never requested that such a thing like this be in your portfolio when I gave you your own agency." Gehlen's frown turned into a light smile, and Wessel felt like he wanted to grab on to something. "This is not your problem to deal with. It is mine. I suggest... downscaling your ideas of what you should do and realizing what you should not do." He could see the emotions begin to rise in Wessel's eyes, and that was his call. "Leave it to me, Agent.""

The bracing wind forced him to pull his coat closer to himself, and he quickly entered the black Mercedes awaiting him. "Pleasant trip, sir?" The agent sat opposite him proffered him a file, and gave a tap on the glass between them and the driver. The car pulled away with a purr. \n\n"As good as it could be in this weather." Gerhard opened the file. He had read it before but he preferred to commit information to memory. Paper was unreliable. "Where is Felfe located. The sooner we find out what he knows about the autopsy, the better. " \n\nThe agent looked down sheepishly. "I'm afraid we've been unable to locate him, sir. As soon as I arrived I swept his known hangouts, but by all accounts he hasn't been seen in over a week. We searched his home top to bottom, but no luck." \n\nWessel gave an almost imperceptible frown. The agent's head lowered further. He had expected complications, naturally - complications were nine tenths of his work. Without Felfe, however, this lead was a dead end. Felfe was apparently only person left to have seen the autopsy report,  and the fact he hadn't already revealed it indicated he was saving it for someone else.\n\nThe car slowly pulled its way through the streets of Kyiv. It was a difficult task - the roads were potholed and clogged with a mixture of ancient Soviet vehicles belching smoke and imported German cars, seeming all the more grimy for their spots of gloss black. The signposts were a confusing mixture of German and Ukrainian - both in Cyrillic and the bastardised Latin script that had developed from the confluence of cultures.

His agents had redoubled their search of the city - not just for Felfe but for any subversive that might harbour him or hurt him. He had done some searching of his own, wandering the city. It was remarkable what you could learn just from walking the streets, visiting the bars, finding the feel of people. \n\nNaturally, the Ukrainians and Russians remained churlish against the Reich, with many a drunken curse raised against the Germans. While his agents had indeed determined the presence of local resistance movements, both left and right, they were not his concern. No, it was what he had found in an alley behind a decaying beer hall that disturbed him. \n\n"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit". Not words he had expected to hear in this place, the severed half of their national anthem. Well, one of them, he smirked. He tossed the pamphlet back to his desk, the black, red, gold seeming to glow in the light.  Reichsbanner had beaten him here - a deeply disturbing prospect. He had expected locals, but for German insurgent movements to have travelled this far East? \n\nThis all but confirmed it - Felfe's previous mission regarding the Ukrainians was only a secondary concern to him. Felfe no doubt knew Reichsbanner had been here, but had never reported it. He had been compromised.  A skilled infiltrator, Felfe would have attempted to worm his way into the local resistance. Gerhard knew not where to find Reichsbanner, but his Büro had leads on the Ukrainians. He would find the man, by hook or by crook."

No claim that outrageous holds up to close inspection however,  and a few smashed printing presses later revealed that the author, one Viacheslav Chornovil, occupied the deep forests outside Kyiv along with his band of outlaws. Chornovil was viewed as something of a Robin Hood figure by the locals, and had been a great disturbance in the region to Wessel's colleagues. Thus the Büro began its search, finding a remarkable lack of dissidents and a surfeit of trees. It was not until one agent quite literally fell into the answer, that they located a tunnel. \n\nOne geologist and several aerial surveys later, they determined the locations of the other entrances. Thus, Gerhard waited, lying under a pile of branches and camouflage netting. Two other entrances were monitored by his two best agents, and they had made note of the incomings and outgoings of the sizeable tunnel complex - more than two dozen separate people were noted. Wessel made a mental note to order any similar networks rooted out immediately. Through his binoculars, Wessel noticed motion. Glancing at the blurry photo captured yesterday, he recognised the moustachioed face of Viacheslav Chornovil clambering from a cramped tunnel, before sitting on a rock and lighting a cigarette. Gerhard exhaled sharply as he recognised the second rising figure as Heinz Felfe. \n\nGerhard cursed himself for the distance at which he had placed himself - overly cautious, he could not hear their words.

The conclusion was obvious, however. Someone in the RND was manipulating the Ukrainian resistance, and likely others across the Reich. Someone who knew why Reichsbanner was here."

 speer_rnd.66.t:0 "Spy vs Spy"
 speer_rnd.66.d:0 "Maintaining the flow of information was Wessel's job. No decision should be made without the most complete knowledge of the situation possible, and it was the Reichsnachtdienst that kept these channels of information open - or so he had thought. It seemed Reinhard had fallen into that old spymaster's trap, the hoarding of knowledge for his own sake. It was therefore up to Wessel to restart the flow. \n\nTo the untrained eye, the headquarters of the Reich's foremost intelligence agency was just another office building. Cleaners have a unique ability to go unnoticed in a crowded room. All too easy for a loose sheet of paper or a cassette to fall into the bag while its owner was preoccupied. A microphone concealed within a lampshade might be noticed in an office, but nobody would even consider searching for one behind the bowl of a toilet, and conversations become less formal when one has their fly undone. \n\nGerhard now enjoyed the fruits of his labours in his office. The unmarked cassette was playing into a pair of headphones. The fact that this tape existed at all was damning enough, but the contents disturbed him greatly. The recording was of a phone conversation - at one end Gehlen's crackling voice; the other, the unmistakable tone of their Führer Albert Speer. He listened to it to its completion, then removed the film from the tape, concealing it within an empty bottle of pills. Gehlen was a true rogue agent, at the head of one of the world's largest intelligence agencies. Reinhard was smart, and revealed much while demanding nothing - nonetheless, Gerhard could recognise the hint of extortion. \n\nTruly, nobody was without sin - Gerhard had known many of the darker secrets of the Reich, but could only hypothesise whether Speer had been party to them. If Gehlen revealed any of what he had found, the Reich would collapse in on itself. Speer had buried his past deep yet Gehlen found it nonetheless. A stark warning of what he was facing. If he was to act against Reinhard Gehlen he must act fast - for the safety of the Reich that his mentor had so clearly forgotten."

There were only a select few he could trust with this information - he could only pray he would reach them before Gehlen realised what was missing. He marched through the office floor of the Büro Wessel, giving dismissive nods to those who met his gaze. \n\n"Excuse me, Herr Kätzchen? I have a message for you." \n\nGerhard turned to see a man in dark sunglasses. The man extended his right hand with a slip of paper, clearly expecting him to take it. His left was lazily resting in his coat pocket.  Wessel reached into his pocket as though reaching for a pen; his eyes darted from side to side, establishing the visitor was alone. The man's eyebrows furrowed, and the corner of his mouth turned as he realised his bluff had been called. \n\nWessel pulled his penknife from his pocket all too slowly, as the man's left hand emerged from his coat holding a slim pistol. In one smooth motion the man's arms straightened, the oversized suppressor brushing against Wessel's ear as he jerked to the side. Its detonation nonetheless deafened him and threw off his balance, and he fell into the assassin in a tangle of limbs. A blind thrust of the blade made contact and he stabbed, the knife finally connecting with the man's throat. \n\nWith a gurgle the man in sunglasses expired. Wessel arose, clutching at the side of his head. The bullet had grazed his skull, and from what he could tell taken most of his left ear with it.  The shot had roused the rest of the Büro, and Wessel had to slam down the telephone of a wide eyed secretary who was in the process of calling the Orpo. Whatever number was dialled next, Wessel could guarantee it would not be the one that picked up. \n\nHe barked out swift orders to leave. His Büro had planned for a situation similar to this, though he had never thought they would ever be implemented. His staff would scatter, and the Büro would go dark. He, however, had a meeting to attend. If Speer was compromised, he had to find the next best thing. Exiting through his own secret door, hidden in a den of electrical wires and transformers, he turned up his collar, put on his hat and made for the Reichskanzlei."

The Chancellor had assured him of the man's trustworthiness, but that did not stop Gerhard from uneasily glaring at him whenever he went to produce some instrument from his bag. He attempted to piece together the recent events in his head, whilst he had a moment of peace. \n\nDutschke's murder had been the flashpoint, and Gerhard was now all but certain Gehlen had ordered it. Further still, Bachmann had been eliminated to throw Wessel off the trail. Gehlen's Büro had been hoarding secrets, making hidden contacts, selling information that was not theirs to sell. They had actively been working against Wessel's own agents from the beginning. To what end? And most damning of all, Gehlen was extorting the Führer himself - one last insurance policy in case the depth of his double-dealing came to light. \n\nHow had this happened? Reinhard Gehlen was an intelligent man, one Wessel had looked up to. Now, Gehlen had sunk to sending hitmen after him in broad daylight. He was sloppy, out of touch, and most of all he could not be trusted. Trust was everything in their business - who to trust and distrust decided who was alive and who was dead.  He turned to look out of the window, and glimpsed a dull red glow. \n\nHe shook off the protesting doctor, and went to the window. In the distance were the party rally grounds, the great theatre in which the NSDAP had performed their ecstatic rallies ever since Hitler took power. In the centre was the Ehrentribune, the vast podium wreathed with swastikas from which he had spoke and yelled and cried, which to many represented the golden days. \n\nIt was burning."

If slavery were to be abolished at once, the Reich would collapse, for few Germans had maintained the skills required to manage an industrial economy. Of course, this message went unheeded by the slaves themselves. \n\nKZ Monowitz, a work camp producing synthetic rubber for IG Farben, had suffered in productivity this last month. The predominantly Polish workers had attempted a campaign of passive protest, gathering in their hundreds and refusing to work until their demands were met. These demands had included increased rations, shorter working hours and the right to contact their families outside in what was once Poland. \n\nUnfortunately, these demands had not reached the capital by the time the protests had been dealt with. The camp guards, some of whom had been dealt a beating before being expelled had received encouragement from the camp's management in IG Farben, and with support from the local Orpo force bloodily retook the camp. Fatalities had been estimated at up to 70% of the workforce. The duty of Wessel and his Büro was to improve future camp security, and prevent the spread of protests."

Attempt to cordon them in one block and they acquired a supernatural knowledge of the way out. Reports from one end of the city of spontaneous riots would turn out to be false leads, allowing further damage in other areas. Every time they attempted to contain the protests they found some way around, creating the constant background of yelling that seemed to encompass Germania these days. \n\nDamnation, but Reichsbanner was good.

While all were reluctant to send in the army, it had been accepted to use off duty servicemen and party members in old police gear. Still, the line seemed all too thin. \n\nHis investigations had been slow. These protests were organized - radio frequency scans had revealed encrypted transmissions of a type that none of his cryptographers had been able to break yet. That the code would be broken was inevitable, for his Büro had unofficial access to the largest supercomputers in the Reich - the question was, would that be soon enough? If Reichsbanner were responsible they were proving smart enough that more than likely they would have shifted to new frequencies and new codes by the time they RND had broken the encryption. \n\nHe allowed himself a cigarette - a rare luxury. Addiction was a weakness, but it had been long enough that he didn't care. Whoever was behind this had funding and brainpower, enough to stay that one step ahead.

Kurass's official report states that he acted in self defence when Muller attacked him with an improvised weapon. Muller's friends, when later questioned, would state that Muller was dragged into an alley by Kurass and his comrades. The post-mortem examination confirmed that Muller was shot in the back of the head. The results had not been published, and the internal investigation had soon been called off. Kurass would be remanded internally, for to bring charges against a police officer at this time would be dangerous.  \n\nWessel cursed the thugs they hired to the Orpo, cursed the whole sorry affair. He did not have to view the protests from his window anymore - he could hear them.

RND operatives had been unable to uncover little of their operations other than their presence, and the fact that wherever Burgundian agents went, chaos and destruction soon followed. He'd heard unsubstantiated reports that they were behind virtually every political assassination in every country in the past twenty years, and partisan movements across the globe had been noted to carry arms bearing arms traced to the Silent State.  \n\nThe motives for these operations were still unknown, with a single shred of concrete information from stolen SS documents in Italy sent before their mole went dark - the operations all contributed towards Himmler's Globalplan.

Without the threat of a powerful enemy, corruption and infighting began tearing the Wehrmacht apart in what historians would probably call "a twisted parody of the Late Roman Empire"\n\nLike the Roman generals they were so fond of, the highest German officers bought the loyalty of their men by promising hefty bonuses at the end of their service, siphoning the needed funds from the Reich's budget with the subtle threat of open revolt should anyone refuse them. As a result, the Wehrmacht bloated horrendously, eating more and more of the public expenses and contributing to the final collapse of the German economy. The increase in dimensions, however, didn't result in a better military: on the contrary, overloaded logistics, unfit recruits, outdated equipment and infighting between officers turned what was once a jewel of efficiency into a wheezing sick patient, as the Second Russian War showed perfectly.\n\nNow, with the civil war over, Von Tresckow has planned a large reform of the German armed forces to return them to their former glory. The program will concern all of the Wehrmacht, from the Heer, to the Luftwaffe, to the Kriegsmarine: everything will be turned upside down, until it fits his ideals once again. However, this won't be an easy task: many officers of the old guard are still in active service and will try to resist the reform at all costs, especially if they are supported by the conservative elements of the NSDAP.

The German air force was the personal playground of Herrman Göring, the main responsible for the current decadence of the Reich, and a large number of officers owe their rank to him: despite his defeat, his political clout is still present, and it will take time and effort to remove it before any real reform can be passed without mass desertions or worse.\n\nGöring's influence, however, wasn't limited to the officers, but it covered even the doctrinal aspects of air combat. As of now, our air fleet is heavily unbalanced towards long-range bombers - the result of a decade-long bombing campaign over Russia and Western Africa - and even worse, due to the gargantuan costs of running such a meaningless operation, there weren't enough funds to develop new airframes to keep up with the new discoveries.\n\nAs a result of this, the Luftwaffe is extremely outdated in both doctrines and equipment, despite its large numbers, and will most likely perform with abysmal results against any modern air force of the world."

This exponential growth, however, overloaded the supply system until it finally broke, and only served to enrich the weapons industry in cahoots with the military leadership.\n\nWith the constant downturn of the German economy, more and more money was diverted towards maintaining this living corpse - the mere thought of cutting military spending was met with subtle threats of civil war - with the result that any kind of research or improvement was halted due to lack of funds. Poorly-trained soldiers, outdated panzers, malfunctioning aircraft and old doctrines were the reasons for the collapse of the German defenses during the West Russian War, but not even this was enough to let the corrupt High Command understand the depth of their mistakes, and the Heer continued its decadence.\n\nWith the civil war over, the Heer has been left reeling from its losses and from the difficulty of serving once more alongside those who mere months before were manning a machine gun aimed at you. This, however, is also the perfect time for reform: Von Treskow has a clear idea of what he wants the German army to become, and he won't stop until it has become reality. This, however, might be difficult, as several prominent generals and field marshalls, chief among them Ferdinand Schrörner, will try to stop him at any cost."

The West Russian War saw spelled even more cuts for the navy as the generals took more and more funds for their pet projects and to feed the bloated monster that was now the army.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out, the Kriegsmarine sided with Bormann, but Dönitz decided to retreat to Crimea, realizing that no matter his allegiance, there was no way the navy could do anything except getting either sunk or scuttled.\n\nDespite surviving the war almost untouched, however, the Kriegsmarine is in a dire state. Years of neglect have left the navy small and obsolete, with most ships dating back to the last war: as things are, a total overhaul is needed in both doctrine and equipment, to bring it back from the dead and turn it into a modern fleet. Despite the resistances of admirals formerly close to Dönitz, von Tresckow knows a new and powerful Kriegsmarine is necessary if Germany is to return at the forefront of military innovation."

On one hand, we could go the safe route and focus on infantry weapons: better rifles and grenades will have an impact throughout the entire Heer, no matter the unit or doctrine. Another choice is artillery: gone are the times of giant railway guns, now self-propelled weapons and light, infantry-portable mortars are the way forward, improving mobility and efficiency of the support units. Some wish to improve the support echelons of the Heer with better logistics, modern engineers and advanced medical detachments to fully aid our troops in their task.

When the officers of the Wehrmacht started siding with this or that pretender, swearing their loyalty to their frontrunner, they caused a bloody civil war that caused untold amounts of victims.\n\nNow, some reformist officers wish to fully detach the army from the party, even more than what the new leader desires, and the first step would be to replace the oath of loyalty to the Führer with a more neutral oath to the nation and its institutions. While these officers aren't showing any sign of disloyalty, and will accept any decision on the matter, it's evident that this will have repercussions on the larger political debate: already the reformists within the Reichstag call for a comprehensive reform to remove any political influence in the army, while the conservatives are trying to stop what they call a "dangerous push towards anarchy"\n\nAs the government is called to decide on the matter, what will the Führer do?

The only problem is whether the new controllers of the islands will be willing to accept our requests..."

speermilitary.12.t:0 "Demand from Berlin"
speermilitary.12.desc:0 "Even in this forgotten corner of the world, Germany refuses to let anything slip from their claws.\n\n A communique arrived via radio broadcast just hours ago from the Reich; though communications with the continent are usually verbose in tone, this message was brusque and brutally clear. Berlin demands complete surrender and the return of the islands to the Reich or else within 48 hours a state of war would exist between us. Given the predisposition of Berlin and the unnaturally lethal tone of the message, we have been given every reason to believe that they intend to make good on their promise.\n\n Our forces - those that will follow our orders at least - are being made ready, though none hold the delusion that the Reich's warmachine could be bested. Perhaps, however, they will not have to be. Given our geographical position and relative miniscularity, it is unlikely that they would bring to bear the entire Wehrmacht against Madagaskar. As such, if they send a proportionate force it is possible to resist and make a quick invasion turn into a grueling exercise in hubris.\n\n But even so, not even our most optimistic officers expect this assumption to prove true, as the Germans are just as likely to rain ordnance on our heads until we throw down our weapons or die in the process, and it's likely they don't much care which outcome arises first. Ultimately, the ruthless calculus of war has a habit of reducing one's choices. Our future can only lie on one path; do we stand down and submit the islands to the Reich, or make Berlin come and take them?"

When their reply was not made ready quickly enough, an incoming fly-over of the island by our bombers served to catalyze a faster response. As of right now reprisals are planned, but we are working to ensure that sufficient control of the islands and the surrounding waters are achieved first so as to avoid any last-minute complications; even as we are past the point of armed resistance, we intend to avoid the possibility of further issues arising.\n\n Though ownership of Madagascar and its islands is important to the dominance of those southern seas, the true fruit of this endeavor is the public image of a once rebellious land willfully submitting to the rightful rule of our administration. What could have potentially been a disastrous military conflict has instead been transformed into an example of the statesmanship we embody; hopefully we will not need to make a similar example for some time."

speermilitary.14.desc:0 "For hours we've been met with nothing but silence by the rebels in Madagascar, but just now a curt message was delivered via radio; they refuse to surrender the islands to us and have declared that 'any illegal ingress will be met with sovereign force'.\n\n The challenge has been declared, and now we must meet it. The islands of Madagascar not only project vital power along the African coast and the Indian Ocean, but by allowing it to fall to a - ultimately suicidal - seperatist force has resulted in a poor image for the Reich. Our attempts to unify our sphere are crucial to the continuing survival of Germany, and a rogue nation demonstrating the ability to slip free from our authority may result in a domino-effect for our less compliant lands. Therefore, if they seek to become an example to others, then we shall make them one.\n\n The Kriegsmarine has been notified and is being made ready to leave their moorings to prepare for the invasion, army groups are being formed and instructed on how to retake the island, and munitions are already being tasked to air-elements in the region to soften it for our arrival. This affront to the lawful authority of the islands cannot be left to stand and, though it is regrettable that it has been forced to come to this, we must now prepare to make these wayward sons aware of that fact."

"It is literally incomprehensible to me that our armed forces would be unable to reconquer fucking Madagascar. It's Madagascar, for god's sake! Did our intelligence not suggest that they recently had a fucking five-way civil war? Seriously Generalfeldmarschall, what the hell? How is this even remotely possible?". The Generalfeldmarschall did not know how this was possible, so he did not bother to reply.\n\nSpeer calmed himself down, and was thankful no one else was here to witness his highly unusual outburst. To be fair, could he really have been blamed given the ridiculous circumstances? "Well, as humiliating as it is, let us prepare peace negotiations for whoever the hell is even in charge of that god-forsaken island. I suppose they'll simply want their sovereignty to be respected, and perhaps a few other small concessions."

While we fought back as hard as we could, it only took so long for the Germans to seize these small, hardly populated islands.\n\nThere is no choice for us but to surrender to Germany. Hopefully they will at least be lenient and merciful, though history suggests that this is not likely. The islands of the Indian Ocean have changed colonial masters several times within the last few years. When they will probably never see true independence, what is one more changing of hands to the peoples who inhabit them?"

"That will be all, then."\n\nIt might have been all for Madagascar, but it will not be all for the reconquests demanded by German Imperialism.

It could just be to retake the strategically valuable islands of Mauritius and Reunion, or perhaps they have worse in mind, but either way we know that Germany is actively preparing to invade our territory quite soon.\n\nIt is hard to see how this is a winnable fight for us, but we will not abandon any of our people or territory.

However, an airplane is much more complicated than a gun or a tank, and even the testing process reflects this: once the research department has finalized the proposed designs, the testing truly begins with the flight tests.\n\nIn this phase, unfortunate pilots are put at the helm of what can range from a perfectly-functional jet fighter to a flying coffin only waiting to close itself on the poor sod. Takeoff accidents, on-air engine failures, sudden airframe detachment, and many, many more: the list of the problems experienced by testing pilots is only as long as the list of the causes of their death, and many promising aviators have met their untimely end just because the one in charge of development forgot to factor a zero, or to put a comma where it was needed.\n\nStill, no one can deny that the results of this tear-filled process are extremely promising, and so the airstrips of the military airports across the Reich fill with strange, barely-flying planes challenging the laws of physics with frames barely kept together with glue, thread and the fervent prayers of their pilots."

"Such a perfect time to fly" he thought with a small sigh, then he chuckled: his wife always complained that he lost entire hours staring outside the window, but what could he do? He was an aviator, his very soul linked to the endless blue: only his brothers-in-arms could understand the feeling of longing to be up there, high into the clouds, literally on top of the world. Humans however, unlike birds, need artificial wings to reach above the clouds, and he was too old for that now, so he did the only thing he could do: he looked outside, and remembered the old days.\n\nHis gaze passed over the small display case near the fireplace: his two Iron Crosses were there, alongside his pistol and a small piece of the airplane he almost died inside when he was downed the second time. He shuddered at the memory, but even those difficult days were so beautiful, so dangerous, so exciting! Back then, when he had served the Kaiser in Italy and France, airplanes were but wooden caskets with an engine: to think that such things could even fly without exploding! And yet he was witness to their agility and power, and to the bravery and camaraderie of the men piloting them. He remembered the Caproni bomber he desperately tried to take down above Treviso, only for himself to be the one falling to the ground. He remembered flying over Verdun during a night with no moon, the artillery strikes lighting the darkness like a starry sky upside down. He remembered his comrades, his friends, even his enemies, all people who fought with their life to the line, and never surrendered.\n\nA voice awakened Fritz from his small trip into the past, and he realized the sun has long since set. Poor Margarethe, she cooked for him and even had to call him! With a last look to the sky, he got up from his chair, and from the creaks in his bones he could have sworn it was an airplane taking off: his legs were starting to fail him like an old engine. He turned his back to the window and left, but he knew a part of him was still there, staring at the sky."

speermilitary.22.desc:0 "For the entire Wehrmacht, but the Heer more than all others, the Bürgerkrieg was like a scythe wielded by death itself, decimating simple soldiers and officers alike as the fighting degenerated in house-to-house combat, where the entirety of Germany was the frontline, and the command tent was a place like any other to fight and die. The following period wasn't any kinder to the Oberkommando der Heer, as many disloyal, corrupt or incapable officers were systematically purged, leaving a large hole in the officer corps.\n\nHowever, from problems come opportunities, and Von Tresckow knew this very well. The Prussian general spent the years of the reconstruction not only reforming the army doctrines and structural organization, but also training the new generation of officers, to ensure they wouldn't follow in their predecessors' footsteps. One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of the Offizierschule des Heeres in Dresden: staffed by the best remaining military theorists, the new institution was made so that cadets from the entire Reich could learn the new doctrines of war in a suitable environment. Of course, said "environment" would be filled with references to the Prussian discipline and the reformist ideas...\n\nDespite the ideological issues, however, no one can deny that the Offizierschule has done an excellent work. The end of the first training cycle, and the subsequent ceremony in which the young cadets took their rank as full-fledged officers of the Heer, marks a new beginning for the armed forces of the Reich: we can only pray that these new generals and lieutenants will prove worthier than their predecessors, and able to keep the Wehrmacht from descending once more into decadence."

Albert Speer looked at him sternly, Henning Von Tresckow standing at his side, his back rigid and a slightly offended expression on his face. The admiral advanced to the desk and stopped, saluting the Führer as protocol demanded even though his demeanor made it clear he would have wanted someone else on that chair.\n\n"Admiral Dönitz" Speer began, his voice severe, "I have called you here for an important matter regarding your conduct during the civil war"\n\nThe old admiral knew it was coming, so he steeled himself for what was to come. "I'm ready to take my punishment if it is needed" he answered with a calm, resigned voice.\n"During the civil war, it has been proved beyond doubt that you took Bormann's side. Not only that, but you also fled the country during the chaos, taking the majority of the Kriegsmarine with you, disobeying all orders to fight and finding refuge in Crimea"\n"I did that to save the Kriegsmarine!" was the immediate answer, but what came next surprised him.\n"I know that, admiral, and through your action, you saved many ships which would have been lost, or even worse, used against us. For this reason, Von Tresckow and I came to an agreed and fitting solution"\nA barely audible snort told the admiral that the "agreement" was mostly on one side, but he focused his attention back on Speer.\n"For Betraying the Reich and fleeing, you will be stripped of your rank as admiral, and formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty. For saving the majority of the Kriegsmarine from certain destruction or capture, you shall be graced, and your decorations will not be revoked."\n\nThe now-former admiral felt a pang in his heart knowing that his service was over in such a way, but he knew it could have been much worse. He took off his hat and deposited it on the desk, then saluted and left the room without a word."

After the end of the war, the admiral surrendered himself when threatened with retaliation from the new government in Germania. His hopes of keeping his rank were shattered a few months later, when he was formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty, and tried together with several SS members and generals who followed either Göring or Bormann.\n\nWhen the day of the verdict came, Dönitz stood with the other defendants in the courtroom. The judges entered the room, one by one, and then read the final sentence: the admiral didn't listen what had been decided for the others, though the amount of screams and cries told him that convictions were far more than acquittals. Finally, it was his turn, and it took all he had not to join the rest of the accused in their screams: "The court declares Karl Dönitz, chief admiral of the Kriegsmarine, culprit of treason and dereliction of duty, and for this he is sentenced to be stripped of all his ranks and decorations, and to thirty years of detention"\n\nAs the guards stripped him of the signs of his rank, he didn't protest, and when they brought him away in handcuffs, he didn't even try to resist.

At the given signal, the combined might of the Wehrmacht was unleashed upon the unfortunate earth mound.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine opened fire upon the enemy positions, neutralizing anti-air batteries and grievously damaging several other emplacements. Immediately after, bombers from the Luftwaffe dropped their deadly cargo upon the trenches, anti-tank cannons and machine guns, clearing the way for the Heer. Tanks rolled towards their target, and infantry both motorized and on foot followed in their wake to occupy the objective. Thanks to the radio coordination, there were no instances of friendly fire, and the entire operation was declared a success.\n\nFor the entire time, Henning Von Tresckow looked with a satisfied expression at the scene unfolding a few hundred meters from his command tent. Several other members of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht - generals, aviators and even a couple Kriegsmarine officers - were present,  all murmuring their approval for how the army reforms were having their desired effect.

Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt had shown eagerness at the prospect of reaching out to the Americans. The letter was good - stately but not too domineering, eloquent but not flowery. The letter was not the question. The Americans may have sent arms back when he was directing mobs of students, but now he was at the helm of the ship, who knew what they would want? "I'm sure I don't need to impress upon you the importance of this summit. You represent " \n\n  "I do. The Americans want things to cool down just as much as we do. They'll have their demands, but I don't think they'll be unreasonable with our country's history of walking out of negotiations."

Speer would have wanted them brought straight to Germania to see his Volkshalle - the Führer thought himself a humble man but how he could stand to see that bulging growth of national arrogance every day, Helmut could not understand. The Americans would not like it, as much as they loved their monuments. Plus, it was fucking freezing in there.\n\n The door opened behind him.

The brief head rush it provided gave him as much clarity as it seemed to sap from everyone else in the room - the Amerikaners gave one another an unspoken message that was more of a scream.

Thus far however, all was going to plan. \n\n "In order to resume official diplomatic relations between our nations," Dowling coughed, "there must be some concessions." Schmidt took another drag, and gestured for him to continue. \n\n "Number one. Nuclear parity must be maintained but overall stockpiles must be reduced. An overall reduction in worldwide nuclear stockpiles is essential to maintain peace. Number two. The institution of forced foreign labour in Germany is unacceptable, and while current efforts to end it are recognised the rights of the workers must be improved until workers can be repatriated.

SPEERUSA.102.desc:0 "The negotiations had continued off and on for several days - the Americans had played remarkably coy with their demands so far, but only a fool would have let the proceedings begin without an idea of what the Americans would demand at the end. In fact it was predictable how unpredictable they were being. Everyone here had clearly learned from the same playbook, which made it all the easier to dance between them with unspoken promises and tie them in knots with double meanings. \n\n Reichsminister Schmidt lit his third cigarette of the meeting. The brief head rush it provided gave him as much clarity as it seemed to sap from everyone else in the room - the Amerikaners gave one another an unspoken message that was more of a scream. He had known what they would ask for days ago - those since had just been to decide what he was willing to give. It was a difficult game, one where neither his own government nor the oppositions could know his goals. Thus far however, all was going to plan. \n\n "In order to resume official diplomatic relations between our nations," Dowling coughed, "there must be some concessions." Schmidt took another drag, and gestured for him to continue. \n\n "Number one. Nuclear parity must be maintained but overall stockpiles must be reduced. An overall reduction in worldwide nuclear stockpiles is essential to maintain peace. Number two. The institution of forced foreign labour in Germany is unacceptable, and while current efforts to end it are recognised the rights of the workers must be improved until workers can be repatriated. Number three. World trade must be renormalised, and trade between our nations would go a long way towards that." \n\n Another drag - so predictable. Schmidt had considered this days ago. He ground his cigarette into the ashtray to the obvious relief of his counterpart, and said -"

SPEERUSA.10.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction Treaty"
SPEERUSA.10.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as an agreement was struck between the OFN and the Pakt regarding nuclear proliferation. A downscaling in Germania's nuclear arsenal was agreed to in exchange for the United States beginning to scale down, and perhaps end, the embargo presently surrounding the Reich. Peace on the continent was the point of the embargo, after all, and with this agreeable new Reich entering the world stage, it seems unfair to continue the chokehold on them."
SPEERUSA.10.a:0 "They've changed, right?"

SPEERUSA.11.t:0 "Human Rights Treaty"
SPEERUSA.11.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as the Pakt has agreed to introduce new rights for their slave population. A charter will be drawn in the coming months for a full list of human rights to be phased into the Reich's government, drawing inspiration from those that American citizens already enjoy. Talks began about perhaps expanding this to an international agreement on the subject, but for now, Germania will retain mastery of this legislation. In return, the United States agrees to reduce the embargo surrounding the Reich. The immorality of national socialism was the point of the embargo, after all, and with a more liberal Reich making these first steps, it seems unfair to continue punishment for old crimes."
SPEERUSA.11.a:0 "We were slavers once."

SPEERUSA.12.t:0 "Germany agree to America First Policy"
SPEERUSA.12.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as the Pakt has allowed the United States exclusive rights in trade as part of a new 'America First' policy. To bring the two nations closer together economically and symbolically, the United States will have first choice of exports and preference over other nations in the goods produced by Germany. In return, the United States agrees to move to ending the embargo surrounding the Reich. Sometimes, the economic opportunities provided in trade must be considered above mere political ideals, and with a new business partner extending an olive branch, it seems irrational to continue such a destructive policy."
SPEERUSA.12.a:0 "Money talks."

SPEERUSA.13.t:0 "America First and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.13.desc:0 "A major breakthrough in the negotiations today, with the Pakt agreeing both to exclusive trade rights for the United States and the introduction of a human rights charter into their legislation. America will now get first choice of German exports, while the large slave population will enjoy new freedoms based on those that the American citizenry already enjoy. In return, the United States agrees to loosen and eventually end the embargo surrounding the Reich. With both an economic agreement and an impactful reform promised by the Reich, the United States would be both fiscally irresponsible and morally destitute to continue the destructive trade blockade."

SPEERUSA.15.t:0 "Nuclear Disarmament and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.15.desc:0 "The Germans have agreed to reducing their nuclear stockpile as well as ensuring more rights for their "Indentured Workers".

SPEERUSA.16.t:0 "Germany Agrees to All Three Demands."
SPEERUSA.16.desc:0 "The Germans, in a very surprising turn of events indeed, have accepted all demands on the table. They will begin not only reducing their nuclear stockpile, but begin an american first trade policy, as well as improving their slaves rights. While the German delegation seemed quite eager to agree, no small amount of praise should be kept from our diplomats who were able to hammer out this treaty with grace."
SPEERUSA.16.a:0 "This could lead to something bright indeed."

SPEERUSA.17.t:0 "Germany Says No To Everything"
SPEERUSA.17.desc:0 "The Germans seemed quite eager to talk about american concessions, but when it came time to talk about what Germany would be willing to concede, they became mute. Offering not even lip service to the idea. This is an outrage, and a slap in the face of any meaningful discourse that could come about from these talks. Our delegation has had enough, walking out of the meetings until such a time that the Germans are willing to actually talk. Diplomatic channels are starting to break apart, with the Reich refusing to change their tune."

SPEERUSA.18.t:0 "Americans Walk Out"
SPEERUSA.18.desc:0 "After days of talks, and the Americans getting more and more frustrated, they have decided enough is enough and walked out of the talks.

They are upset because we refuse to bend to their will, they ask us to humiliate ourselves on the world stage, and when we deny them, they act the child. The Reich will never show pity to it's former enemies, the sooner they realize this, the sooner we can get these talks done."

SPEERUSA.19.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction"
SPEERUSA.19.desc:0 "In order to earn the favour of the United States, we have agreed to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal. While we of course wouldn't mention it to the Americans, our stockpile is more than large enough that decommissioning a portion of them is not really a major hit to the Reich's geopolitical strength. And though we are hardly naive enough to believe this could ever lead to the total erasure of the threat of global nuclear destruction, this move is absolutely a small step in the right direction. /n/nAnd, arguably more importantly, we are hoping that this significant goodwill gesture will be enough to persuade the Americans to restore full diplomatic relations and to end the embargo between the US and the Reich. We have refused the Americans' other two major demands, but even this relatively smaller undertaking is causing a humongous uproar among the military high command. It'd be nice if the idiots in the OKH were able to realize that engaging in diplomacy such as this de-necessitates the use of their fancy nuclear toys in the first place, but regardless this move is what's best for Germany so we will not heed their inane screeching."
SPEERUSA.19.a:0 "If we'd known nukes were such valuable bargaining chips, we'd have made more of them!"

SPEERUSA.20.t:0 "Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.20.desc:0 "While the most dedicated Nazis and hardcore social conservatives are likely to fearmonger about the potential slippery slope it causes, we have agreed to give the millions of slaves across the Reich a degree of human rights. To those in our administration who oppose slavery for economic reasons, moral reasons, or both, this concession is actually a major relief; because it is a move for the purpose of lifting the trade embargo between ourselves and the United States, those who would disapprove of our decision will be convinced it is purely for pragmatic purposes. /n/n Considering America's own tumultuous recent history with slavery, we hope that this considerable change in policy will be enough to persuade them that we are worthwhile and ethical partners. Whether or not that is the truth is irrelevant as long as the Americans see us in that light, of course."
SPEERUSA.20.a:0 "Surely Germany will now be a paragon of morality."

SPEERUSA.21.t:0 "America First"
SPEERUSA.21.desc:0 "Let's be realistic. Outside of the Reich, who does Germany even have strong relations with these days? No one in the Sphere, the OFN, or Russia. South America? Not really. If we want to form strong economic ties with one of the world's foremost economies, it is hardly much of a sacrifice to guarantee the Americans first dibs on the bounty of products and services the Reich has to offer. This move will certainly make a restoration of trade much more enticing to the Americans, as it will undoubtedly be a huge boon for their economy and development. As it would be for ours as well. /n/n Hopefully, this economic offer is enough to satisfy them, as we are effectively refusing their other two (political and ethical) offers. It's not like the US is a perfectly moral actor themselves, so who are they to judge anyway?"
SPEERUSA.21.a:0 "They probably care more about their imports than our slaves."

SPEERUSA.22.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and America First"
SPEERUSA.22.desc:0 "We have decided to give in to two of the three major American demands: we will somewhat reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile, and will grant the United States unmitigated priority trade access to the many goods produced in the Reich. While we have denied the request to grant our substantial slave population a greater degree of rights, these other two concessions will hopefully not be as potentially harmful to our social fabric and popularity. Of course, we are still experiencing a large amount of hostility from our military and from our few diplomats to non-OFN countries. /n/nmHowever, these sacrifices will ultimately be worth the heavy price, as the economic and geopolitical opportunities which would open up to the Reich if the Americans agree would be monumental. Therefore, we are simply awaiting the American response to our most gracious compromise."
SPEERUSA.22.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.23.t:0 "Slave Rights and America First"
SPEERUSA.23.desc:0 "In what is correctly being considered to be a very large concession, we have decided to agree to the American demands to grant limited rights to the millions of slaves working in the Reich, and to give the Americans priority trade access to all of our goods. Due to other geopolitical considerations, we have refused their third demand to reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile. Still, there is likely to be major opposition from the most ideological members of the party and the Reich at large, though we don't have much of a choice. /n/n We chose to make these concessions because the benefits are predicted to outweigh the social costs; we must engage in more trade if we ever want our economy to recover! Let us hope that these policies are enough to persuade the Americans to engage with us, as we would be rather hard pressed to concede anything more. This is for the good of the Reich, and so it must be enough."
SPEERUSA.23.a:0 "A necessary trade-off."

SPEERUSA.24.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.24.desc:0 "In order to appease the Americans, we have agreed to both reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile and grant limited rights to the millions of slaves existing within our borders. While we do expect major backlash from both the military and social conservatives respectively, we are fortunate enough that, in the long term, neither of these changes should cause serious harm to the Reich's social fabric or economy (provided we handle them with the utmost care). /n/n Because of the significant economic gains we would be poised to make in the event the Americans do agree to open up trade with us, such a generous display of good faith will likely outweigh the costs. Additionally, many worrying reports regarding the extent of subversive political groups throughout the Reich suggest that there might even be a subset of our population which is strongly in favour of these reforms. Though that is hardly any consolation, since it is the resistance of people in powerful positions we have to worry about."
SPEERUSA.24.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.25.t:0 "We have Agreed to all Demands."
SPEERUSA.25.desc:0 "We have accepted all the american demands, to reduce our nuclear stockpile, to allow american companies first trade rights in our country, and yes, even allowing more rights for the slaves. It's not an idyll situation, but nothing is in this world. The hardliners back home are sure to be in an uproar. The only shining light is that the Americans are ecstatic with us, promising an end to the embargo in the coming months."
SPEERUSA.25.a:0 "We have that, at least."

SPEERUSA.26.t:0 "None of Them"
SPEERUSA.26.desc:0 "The Americans pushed and pushed, and then act upset when we lash back. We will not accept these demands from a once defeated enemy. The Reich is prouder then that, better then that. Now that we have made clear that we will not accept these outrageous demands, they have become mute. Refusing to communicate with us effectively. These talks are soon to become a joke if nothing can be done."
SPEERUSA.26.a:0 "Why must the Americans be so sensitive?"

SPEERUSA.27.t:0 "The Accords Are Signed"
SPEERUSA.27.desc:0 "With the final handshake, a few signatures here and there, the Accords are done. Celebration between both delegations was reported late into the night. A truly historic moment between two former enemies, a dawn of a new relationship. Some are already calling it an era of Detente. With this, the Reich, and even the world, can move into a more safe, and stable world."
SPEERUSA.27.a:0 "A new chapter begins."

SPEERUSA.28.t:0 "The Führer Speaks"
SPEERUSA.28.desc:0 "With the signing of the accords, and the start of detente with the Americans, some of the NSDAP and even the public are shocked by some of the things agreed to by the Reich. Speer has been working tirelessly to ensure their fears, and to show them that these concessions to the Americans were necessary for the Reich to not only heal, but to grow from what it was before. He has given speeches from Germania to Frankfurt, praising the Reichs diplomats, and the Americans for understanding the need for friendship. Soon, he says, all Germans will have their lives improved with the end of the american embargo.""
SPEERUSA.28.a:0 "We can only hope."

SPEERUSA.29.t:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
SPEERUSA.29.desc:0 "Upon arriving in New York City, Schmidt didn't know how to feel. He'd never seen a city like this before. It was cluttered with countless tall, imposing, and- frankly- ugly buildings that left a unique and indescribable impression which could be felt nowhere else on Earth. What was it? This city was so foreboding and yet so utterly charming. Why couldn't a single German city produce this sort of emotion in its architecture? It made Schmidt want to explore! /n/n Unfortunately, reality got in the way of Schmidt's daydreaming. An entourage of diplomatic staff awaited him, and Schmidt was stuck shaking their hands and exchanging pleasantries for what seemed like an eternity. But, Schmidt reminded himself, restarting relations with the United States was of the utmost importance and would lead to the betterment of living conditions for all of humanity. So of course, Schmidt buttered up every last staffer as much as he could without brown nosing, and even managed to engage in some legitimately friendly and amicable conversations. Hell, he even managed to crack a few well-received jokes. But once all of that babble was said and done came the sightseeing. /n/n Naturally, there was beautiful Central Park, flashy Times Square, the monumental Empire State Building, and of course, Lady Liberty herself (admittedly not as large as expected from a distance but still symbolically powerful). Interestingly, Schmidt at one point passed through a neighbourhood called Greenwich Village, apparently home to people and activities his colleagues considered "degenerate," though Schmidt never understood how people's private business bothered others. All in all, Schmidt had rarely had a more exciting day and was completely enthralled by NYC's alluring atmosphere."
SPEERUSA.29.a:0 "New York, New York: A hell of a town!"

SPEERUSA.30.t:0 "The City of Angels"
SPEERUSA.30.desc:0 "As the Luftwaffe VIP plane began its descent, Schmidt couldn't help experiencing a mixed range of feelings upon viewing Los Angeles's skyline. While it was no doubt impressive, it seemed as if it were a work of progress that had stalled and stunted over a decade ago. The abundance of military installations and vehicles surrounding the city's harbour reminded Schmidt that the Japanese occupation of the US's major West Coast Ports had likely crippled the region's industry and thus the growth of what was once the most impressive city on the entire Pacific Ocean. Of course, it wasn't like the Reich was in much better shape after its own self-imposed economic downturn and the Bürgerkrieg. "More lives being ruined by fascism. What's new?" Schmidt thought to himself. But voicing such opinions aloud would be just as damaging to his mission here as it would be to his career (and no doubt his life) back home. /n/n Much more concerning than the quality of L.A.'s skyline was the quality of Schmidt's reception, consisting of some random, nameless bureaucrats whose names Schmidt begrudgingly decided he would eventually learn anyway for the sake of making a good impression. After enough obligatory handshakes and small talk to drive even the most shallow of aristocrats to madness, Schmidt was finally able to do some sightseeing. There was the lively Santa Monica Pier with an ocean view unrivalled anywhere in the continental Reich, the both elegant and exciting Griffith Observatory, from which Schmidt could see the famous Hollywood sign in need of repair, and the excessive Venice Canals (funnily, now the only Venice Canals thanks to Atlantropa, yet another Nazi failure) and all sorts of other wonderful, if slightly tacky, attractions. /n/n The bounty of interesting sights was partially marred by Schmidt's necessary security detail, but what really bothered Schmidt was the lack of opportunity to gain a real and honest understanding of how the American people lived day to day. How else could he truly understand what sort of provisions the Americans would surely want in the re-establishment of relations? And, unlike his colleagues, perhaps Schmidt actually gave a damn about the lives of non-Aryan human beings. Oh well."
SPEERUSA.30.a:0 "No time to worry about that now. Off we go!"

SPEERUSA.31.t:0 "Schmidt in the White House"
SPEERUSA.31.desc:0 "It was just a brief and simple event, and largely for the sake of the press anyways, but that didn't mean it wasn't overwhelmingly important. Yet, as he entered the stately White House grounds, Schmidt couldn't carry himself solemnly. He deserved to be jovial in front of the US president and the press. This signing was his success, and more importantly, a success for the downtrodden citizens of the Reich and the United States. Why shouldn't he appear to be happy on the outside, since that was exactly how he felt on the inside? /n/n Cracking a gentle smile, Schmidt shook hands with the president amidst the flashing of the journalists' cameras, and together they walked along the North Lawn and up the steps beneath the building's facade. The president approached a podium standing on the porch and gave a rather run-of-the-mill speech regarding the value and necessity of the deal which was about to be officially signed. Then it was Schmidt's turn. /n/n "Don't worry, I'll keep this very short. We are here today because we have finally realized that we should stop shooting ourselves in the foot, and that it is better for us to cooperate. I assure all of you that some of our previous administration's, so to speak, policies which some might have found a little unsavoury are in many instances unlikely to continue in the same fashion as they have for the last several years. I believe that this is a period of drastic change, and just as today is unrecognizable to the world of 25 years ago, the world 25 years from now will be unrecognizable to us today. And so, we absolutely must ensure that our future is one of prosperity and cooperation, and of a higher quality of life for all of our citizens. This treaty is an excellent first step. Thank you very much.""

SPEERUSA.32.t:0 "Dinner at the White House"
SPEERUSA.32.desc:0 "The culmination of Foreign Minister Schmidt's goodwill tour, the German delegation has now arrived in Washington, D.C. and is prepared to sign away the embargo between our two countries. Though the détente has panned out headspinningly quickly, we of course arranged for Mr. Schmidt to meet with the president for dinner at the White House. /n/n Minister Schmidt was incredibly polite and even jovial, and had little trouble easing any perceived tension between his and our envoys. Apparently a joke of his even cracked a laugh out of the president, which if true would do much to alleviate the pervasive stereotype that all Germans are humourless. /n/n Schmidt and the president stood before the White House's North Lawn and all of the press to officially sign the document ending the embargo between Germany and the US. May God bless the United States of America, and may God bless our new... partners... the German Reich."

SPEERUSA.33.t:0 "The American Delegation Arrives"
SPEERUSA.33.desc:0 ""Mr Dowling, a pleasure. I hope you find our country to your liking." Schmidt shook his hand like it owed him money, and Walter blinked at the bright sunlight that was assaulting him but a moment after he had left the safety of the plane. \n\n"Herr Schmidt, good to finally meet you" he replied, attempting to assert himself. The United States is eager for our parties to come to an agreement for our mutual benefit." \n\n Schmidt smirked behind his face. Off guard and backfooted was how they needed them - diplomats could be so predictable when they fell back on their instructions. Of course he wouldn't have organised this meeting without having planned every moment himself. The issue was too important to be delegated. He gestured to the vast Mercedes-Benz that waited to shepherd them away, shining a glossy black from windows to tyres. \n\n "Of course, of course, but first you must see the sights. Hamburg is a truly beautiful place.""
SPEERUSA.33.a:0 "Hamburg's canals are one of the loveliest sights in Germany."
SPEERUSA.33.b:0 "The city's gardens are unparalleled in natural beauty."

SPEERUSA.34.t:0 "The Canals"
SPEERUSA.34.desc:0 ""In fact, Hamburg has more bridges than any other city in the world!" Schmidt had seemed laid back at their first meeting, but now that they toured his home town the man had lit up. He gestured grandly at yet another stately bridge arcing across the canal. Walter Dowling was the first ambassador to Germany since 1941 - in fact he was the first American to legally set foot on Reich soil in more than twenty years. They walked together, their staff about thirty feet behind. No doubt they were conducting their own diplomacy behind the scenes, while Schmidt and Dowling did their best to ignore the cameras strategically posed above them. \n\n "It sure is a fine place." Walter admitted. It may not have the great skyscrapers of New York, but the place had its own, subtler history. The great city hall overlooking the Alster, the towering cathedral spire, these charming canals - he knew he was being wooed, but damn if Schmidt didn't know how to do it. \n\n They turned a corner, slowing to allow the lackeys to catch up. Schmidt reached into his pocket and pulled out one of those seemingly ever-present cigarettes. He offered one to Walter who shook his head - half the charm of the open city was its clean air, and he already had a splitting headache from the morning spent locked up in that smokehouse of an office with the Reichsminister. Walter turned to examine the brickwork, and came to face something he never thought he would see. He did his best to conceal his strangled gasp as a cough, only half succeeding - Schmidt turned to view the line of bullet holes in the wall, the discarded rubbish that littered it's base, and the bare earth turned to mud that formed a long stain stretching into the canal . The hangers-on rounded the corner as well, and Helmut took a long, long drag. Just when he thought he'd located the perfect route."
SPEERUSA.34.a:0 "There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this..."
SPEERUSA.34.b:0 "This is not what it looks like.."

SPEERUSA.35.t:0 "The Gardens"
SPEERUSA.35.desc:0 "One of the most touching moments of the visit was when the delegation visited the restored Tropengewächshäuser, Hamburg's botanical garden. A painstaking effort had been made to bring them to their former beauty: old photos had been retrieved, and from them a team of experts had acquired the original plants and flowers from their exotic homes, and rebuilt the pavilions and paths scattered across what was once a place of peace and tranquility. Just like that garden - that was the message Reichsminister Schmidt was trying to convey - the entire Reich would slowly become a better place for everyone.\n\nEven though the plants were still very young, and the grass still had to cover all the new flowerbeds, the American delegation was impressed by the effort. That is, until a diplomat stumbled upon a small earth mound while exploring a more secluded part of the garden, dislodging a few stones and revealing what was buried right below.\n\nAt first, Helmut Schmidt was annoyed by the commotion, but as soon as he turned away from his conversation with the ambassador, any trace of mirth disappeared from his face along with its color: barely hidden under a thin layer of earth and stones, was a human arm, its decomposed flesh barely covered by a tattered uniform, dried blood stains still visible on the discolored fabric. The workers were called, and they soon started digging: the first corpse was carefully set on the side of the hole, but immediately under it, another appeared, and another, and another. Despite all the prayers running through Schmidt's mind, they didn't stop.\n\nAs the sun started setting, one hundred and fifty-eight bodies clad in military uniform had been unearthed, and now the entire American delegation was turned towards the pale, heavily-sweating ghost of what was once Helmut Schmidt. The ambassador looked at him sternly, and his words felt steel-cold to the Minister, like an executioner's blade on his victim's neck: "Explain this, Mr. Schmidt. Now." and the answer he received was..."
SPEERUSA.35.a:0 "It's truly sad, Herr Ambassador, but it was our only choice..."
SPEERUSA.35.b:0 "It was the only fitting punishment for criminals such as these!"

SPEERUSA.36.t:0 "A Heated Conversation"
SPEERUSA.36.desc:0 "The American delegation found that they were in for a treat. Speer had himself personally been delivered in the Großer Mercedes to the Hamburg City Hall. Upstanding German citizens had transformed the Emperor's Hall into a magnificent dining room, and the tables were set for a great roast dinner, with plenty of drink on the sides. The Krauts and Americans began with a great conversation on cultural comparisons and personal anecdotes, but stalled for a good half an hour as the head of the delegation and the Führer himself engaged in a fierce argument over the differences between capitalism and national socialism. After some time, the foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, stood up and managed to reconcile the opposing interlocutors. \n\n Even if Herr Speer and the delegation may not see eye-to-eye, Schmidt showed that there is some democratic and liberal spirit thriving underneath the Reich. The reports back home to Washington that night were ample in praise for the regime in Germania. Truly, the Reich is a land of wise men, great artists, and certainly delicious meals."
SPEERUSA.36.a:0 "They have had only a glimpse of the German ideal."

SPEERUSA.37.t:0 "Backtrack"
SPEERUSA.37.desc:0 ""My apologies Ambassador - I did not wish you to have to see this. The war left its scars across the Reich, and reconstruction continues." \n\n Walter approached the wall, scraping at one of the chest-high bullet holes with his fingernail. "Who was this?" He kept his voice level. The various secretaries following at their heels pricked their ears. \n\n ""You understand, of course, that discipline must be maintained in war. The men dealt with here were the worst of the worst - men who flocked to the banners of the likes of Göring, Bormann and Heydrich for the chance to loot, rape and pillage. Hamburg had the fortune of maintaining a strong student militia, who were able to put them down before-" \n\n Ambassador Dowling had knelt down to pick something up. He stood and held it up to Schmidt's eyes. A high heeled shoe, stained a muddy red. For the first time in a long time Schmidt stumbled on his words - his mouth curled in an ugly expression before he sighed and flicked his cigarette into the canal. \n\n "There was much collateral damage. While the students may have been some of our Führer's most ardent supporters, they were... overzealous. \n\n Dowling scowled and dropped the shoe. How many innocent people lay at the bottom of that canal?"
SPEERUSA.37.a:0 "My god.."

SPEERUSA.38.t:0 "Schmidt Explains Themselves"
SPEERUSA.38.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt wore a solemn expression as he narrated to the American delegation the story of the final days of the "Battle for Hamburg" which saw reformist militias face the feared "Verlorene Hoffnung" SS-Division, tasked by Reynard Heydrich to take the city at the beginning of the civil war, when everyone was scrambling to establish control over as much territory and industry as possible.\n\nThe division easily broke through the city outskirts, and started executing anyone suspected of being a Speerite, which meant almost everyone as Hamburg was well-known for harboring reform-aligned sentiments. Then, the militias launched a pincer manoeuver near the university, along the Grinderallee, forcing the enemy to retreat under heavy fire: while most managed to leave, a group of around two hundreds SS took refuge in the botanical garden, but in the end they all either died fighting, or committed suicide.\n\n"I beg you, try to imagine how this beautiful city was after the attack" the Reichsminister pleaded as his audience listened, "Ten thousand civilians had been murdered, the hospitals were full of wounded, the university had been turned into an emergency infirmary, and the obituaries were exploding with bodies so much that we had to store them in the market square: hundreds of innocents and loved ones piled like sandbags, waiting for their turn to be buried without a funeral!" Finally, he looked at the lined corpses with tear-filled eyes, and no one could truly understand whether they were the practiced trick of an expert diplomat, or if one of those "sandbags" after the battle had been someone he knew. "We couldn't bury them. There was no place in the cemeteries, not even for our own people. Sad as it may be, they were buried here not out of cruelty, but to avoid the spread of infection."\n\nAfter a minute of silence, the American ambassador hugged the Minister, expressing his sympathy for the population of this wounded land, and asked him if he was still able to continue the negotiations. Visibly relieved, Schmidt nodded, and they left this small piece of a horrible past behind."

To the American delegation, it felt as if the war had never touched such a place, a snapshot from centuries ago all for them: of course, Helmut Schmidt had prepared everything to make sure this would be a fitting end to the visit.\n\nAfter enjoying a small show on Das Shiff, an old cargo-turned-mobile theater, the bateau docks at the Deichstraße, where a small banquet has been prepared for the esteemed guests. As the German and the American delegations mingle, Schmidt starts to talk with the chief negotiator, a man with a deep love for culture and arts, as well as strong political views.\n"Mister Schmidt-"\n\n"Call me Helmut please, Herr Dowling, we are far from the diplomatic table and we have toiled enough to get this far" came the amicable correction, to which the aged diplomat laughed heartily: "Only if you call me Walter!"\n\nAs the conversation developed, Schmidt realizes that he is being dragged into a political debate. Dowling is subtly suggesting the Reich as it is now would never be able to stand the test of time, and though Helmut agrees in his heart, he can't help but think his duty was to defend the Führer's work: Speer may be an asshole sometimes, and block his reforms with stale concepts such as "moderation" and "not risking another civil war" but openly criticizing him? He wouldn't be so undiplomatic do such a thing in front of a foreign delegation!\n\nAs he takes the wine in his hand, he knows he has to make a choice: counter Dowling's subtle accusations, or divert the course of the conversation?"

It sort of reminds of me of those pictures of Venice your mother kept on the old bookshelf. \n\n As we crossed through this scenery, we came across a wall smothered with flaky black-red splatters, with what looked like bullet dents too. Mr Harry, as you know, served in the war, and when he saw the horror he knew exactly what it was. He told us when we got back to the hotel. A firing squad! Can you believe these krauts want us to think they're back to normal again, going around shooting their own citizens?

Turns out even the Nazis can make something beautiful. \n\n That was, until Joe Merriman got lost wandering off away from the group. We heard a scream from a few metres away and rushed over. Joe had run into a bunch of Kraut construction workers renovating the gardens. Apparently, this involved moving decaying corpses into mass graves underneath the new tulip beds.

They assumed the festival would consist largely of cringeworthy propaganda informing them of Aryan racial supremacy and the glory of the Reich's many military conquests. Luckily, Schmidt had foreseen that issue, and had twisted the arms of the Propaganda Ministry to ensure that only a selection of the Reich's many entertainment and artistic films were chosen for the Americans' viewing. Convincing Speer that impressing the Americans with enjoyable films was more pragmatic than angering them with propaganda was not very difficult. /n/n And indeed, the reactions Schmidt distinguished indicated that Das deutsche Filmfestival in Hollywood was at least a mild success. By far the most popular work shown was an ambitious remake of the hit 1942 drama Die große Liebe; its message was subtly shifted from one of commitment to war to being anti-war, but what really caused it to stand out was its new star: renowned comedy actor Heinz Rühmann, demonstrating his versatile acting abilities portraying Paul, the romantic lead. Schmidt overheard plenty of positive comments and perhaps, even, a few sniffles? /n/n It was hard to say if a few flicks would really help restore a positive relationship between the US and the Reich, but it certainly didn't seem to hurt!"

But Schmidt did not care to attend the airshow, as he didn't wish to be reminded of his time at the Ministry of Aviation; after all, didn't he effectively have a hand in those terror bombings? No, he wouldn't think about it. The sooner Schmidt's diplomatic endeavours succeeded, the sooner Germany could be rid of Nazism, which was all that mattered now as far as he was concerned. /n/n From what Schmidt had heard from one of his envoys, the airshow had been another mild success, with the Luftwaffe squadron impressing the Americans with a variety of formations, maneuvers, and one particularly sharp turn that apparently caused a great number of gasps. Well, as long as all of these goodwill gestures were appreciated by the Americans, Schmidt had nothing to worry about.

The crowning of Reichsminister Schmidt's efforts finally comes in an official communique from the American ambassador in Germania: with a great fair being planned in Boston, not only has the Reich been invited, but an entire pavilion has been reserved for its exclusive use!\n\nImmediately, the news is broadcasted nationwide, and an inter-ministerial committee is immediately appointed to oversee the preparations: with the complexity of such an affair, it's only natural that the ministries for the economic, diplomatic and internal affairs work together to ensure the fair turns into a success. The Führer's open blessing to this endeavor underlines once more how much sway does the Gang of Four hold over the German government...\n\nAt the committee's first meeting, after a first opening message by Albert Speer, in which he encourages its members to "amaze the world with the Reich's greatness", everyone starts working in earnest. As soon as the first folders are opened, already an important question arises, one which will influence all future works: what kind of event will the fair be?\n\nSome wish to create a reduced version of World Fair on the model of the great 1937 Paris fair, where the German pavilion towered over all others; members from the ministry of research propose a technological fair, where the greatest progresses of our scientists and inventors can be put on display for the world to look in envy; finally, more than a few voice their support for a very peculiar idea, which is a cultural fair: rather than showing industrial or technological progresses, how about showing the world that which makes our country unique? As no one wants to back from their position, the committee's head is forced to call a vote, and the final decision is..."

SPEERUSA.54.desc:0 "With the decision taken, the committee can now work head-on towards a World Fair, where all the progresses of the German nation as a whole can be put on display for the world to see and drown in its own envy: each country of the Pakt will have a place to put their culture and their national industry on display. Architects and artists from the Reich's most prestigious faculties and circles are called to design the pavillon, and the tycoons are already in line to have their work showcased.\n\nAs the first lines are drawn, however, a sore point immediately stands out: we are going to have an exposition in a country we fought, and defeated, a mere twenty years ago, and there are many who would strongly oppose all our government stands for; should we try to create a "neutral ground" for the fair, removing all symbols of our regime - especially the swastikas - or should we show the world what we truly are?\n\nOf course, the conservatives are outraged that such a thing is even being discussed: we are a National Socialist nation, and Hitler's guidance was what brought us from a defeated nation, to the world's greatest empire! Denying our legacy is a crime against those who lost their lives to make the Vaterland great!\n\nOn the contrary, reformist members, especially those aligned with Schmidt and Erhard, fear that the sight of a banner with the swastika might scare off American investors, and draw heavy criticism from the political establishment, compromising the fair's success: as such, they vocally ask to "tune down" on the symbols of what may be our political ideology, but risks hurting the feelings of our hosts.\n\nAs the discussion doesn't seem to end, the chairman sighs and calls for a vote on the issue: "those who are in favor of removing all political symbols, please raise their right hand!" and the result is..."

As they point out to their colleagues, we are being hosted by a nation we fought with those exact weapons a mere twenty years ago: surely, their veteran associations and the conservative political establishment would strongly disapprove, or even boycott the fair!\n\nWhile some agree with this train of thought, others stand up, and reply that our new discoveries in the military field are extremely important, and will surely amaze the world! We won the world not thanks to poorly-armed conscripts, but with technological excellency and constant improvement!\n\nAs the discussion keeps going on, the committee head calls a vote to settle the matter once and for all: after the hands are counted, the fair will..."

The building itself fills with color as a variegated crowd enters the offices to vie for patronage: woodcarvers with their finest creations, patissiers bribing the members with an enticing offering of pastries and receipts passed from generation to generation, and even a choir in their traditional attire singing outside the office! The committee headquarters shine as it becomes, just for a few days, a melting pot of German culture.\n\nAs time passes, however, an issue arises. This time, however, the line of division isn't drawn between reformists and conservatives, but between "alcoholics" and "sanctimonious prudes" as they have started calling each other: as hundreds of beer distilleries have offered to sponsor the event, and many of them have asked to have their stands and stalls all throughout the exhibition, there is the question about whether to officially endorse the beer companies or keep the fair family-friendly.\n\nThe committee chairman calls for a vote on the matter, not before finishing his beer though..."

The Amerikaner felt welcomed by the elaborately-decorated building, especially since, with the sole exception of the official flag of the Reich present here and there - the only point the Führer was adamant about - it was devoid of any national socialist symbol. The worries of the Gang of Four proved correct: without anything to criticize, the hawks within the American government were silenced, and everyone enjoyed the fair without any kind of polemic.\n\nWith the resounding success of the event spreading like a wildfire throughout the Vaterland, the reformists acquire even more power within the government, something which irks the Führer more than a bit. In the end, however, he knows this will benefit the Reich, and he'll be the one to ultimately reap the fruits of their efforts, so for the moment he has decided to keep his grumblings to himself, and influence the work of the Four with a lighter tough, as any true ruler knows how to do."

This moment was not to be taken lightly. /n/n Small talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever. /n/n Later, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany.

So, he accepts another glass of wine from the server, and they discuss the pros and cons of Alsatian and Bavarian wines compared to the omnipresent Italian ones, especially now that the entirety of Northern France no longer produces anything worth of note.\n\nThe evening soon turns into night, as the two parties socialize more and more, passing from topic to topic with a spontaneity that is almost unbefitting of seasoned diplomats, but with enough wine, everyone becomes a good friend! As the last desserts are finished, and the waiters begin clearing out the table from the used cutlery, everyone gets up, and all shake their hands before the Americans return to their diplomatic quarters.\n\nA second before boarding the car, Walter Dowling looks seriously at Schmidt: "I know what you are trying to do for your country, Helmut" he begins, opting for once to let go of diplomatic platitudes: "The United States are still unsure about how to truly consider your Führer, whether a true reformer or simply an astute liar, but as long as you are part of his government, I am willing to believe that this country can truly find a way to prosperity after what it has suffered.

When the fair closed, the balance was judged 'sorely negative' and the reformists, like the legendary Cassandra, could only look sadly at the numbers with an expression that said 'I told you'\n\nPerhaps, the conservatives should choose to fight worthier battles..."

As the American public visits our stands, they meet and talk with our people, and learn that we aren't swastika-bearing, Hitler-worshipping, slave-driving monsters like some propaganda depicted us trying to prevent us from being invited to the fair.

It'd be wise to demonstrate that we are no longer seeking the brutal conquest which was, of course, a cornerstone of Führer Hitler's foreign policy, you see." \n An awkward pause lapsed as Speer considered Schmidt's borderline treasonous suggestion. He chewed on the idea for several moments before nodding to himself and saying, "I can see how doing so would be beneficial to our diplomatic efforts, and it might even improve my personal image abroad. But of course, there will be strong resistance from many people here in Germany, especially the social conservatives.

Distancing ourselves from him is absolutely necessary, mein Führer," replied a distant and distracted Schmidt. "I need to go for a walk." Schmidt gave a timid but respectful salute to Speer and quickly exited the building. \n As he walked down Adolf-Hitler-Straße and past the Adolf-Hitler-Platz, Schmidt noticed the many lingering signs of war: former soldiers aimlessly walking the street, some with broken or missing limbs and some begging for spare change; a fair deal of unemployed non-veterans, too; and there were even some buildings that had leftover damage from accidental shelling or bombing during the Bürgerkreig in which so many had sacrificed so much simply for that cunning bastard Speer to enact a slightly less brutal and genocidal version of his predecessor's ideology. \n Adolf Hitler was a man who brought so much unnecessary suffering and destruction to the world. How could the German masses revere him so? Schmidt figured he'd have to emphasize the world's fear and hatred of the man and avoid non-starters like his absurd racial beliefs and genocide. It was a ridiculous and unfair situation, but like always Schmidt would just carry on and make the best of it."

Suddenly, a call interrupted his rancorous thoughts: he answered, listened, and not five minutes later his men too were in parade at the sides of the road. The commanding SS looked at the ten watchmen, slightly amused: "Is this everything the mighty Reich can summon against the Righteous?" he spat at his counterpart. Then, the earth began to tremble.\n\nBefore the SS could speak again, a Panzer appeared from behind a building, and moved at full speed towards the border. The black-uniformed soldiers remained still as the tank got closer, closer, CLOSER. When only a few meters separated the armored beast from the soft flesh, Rudolf smiled in glee: the men in black took one step backwards, then two, and then everyone was falling in disorder as the Grenzwacht laughed.\n\nWith a loud noise, the tank halted one meter over the border. The SS returned, indignation etched over his face: "You are trespassing on the Ordensstaat! I demand that-" he stopped when faced with the barrel of Rudolf's pistol. "You hold no authority here, Verräter" he spat, feeling cruel joy in the way the other's face contorted. "This land belongs to the Vaterland, and you are unlawfully occupying it. There are no borders within the Reich, and the traitor you call "master" will soon understand it!"\n\nAs he spoke, several trucks unloaded a hundred Heer soldiers, who immediately set up building fortifications. The watchman looked the SS dead in the eye, and his voice was cold as steel: "It's only a matter of time before we return to Paris. Enjoy your black uniform while you can, for one day you'll hang from a balcony, and I'll be the one to push you DOWN" and for the first time, Rudolf saw fear in the eyes of the SS."

The black-uniformed German took the letter and gave it a cursory read: he already knew its content, as it was identical to the speech given by the Führer just the day before, then he put it into his pocket and returned to his position, without any outward sign of either interest or worry. After all, it was nothing but the formal certification of the current state of affairs\n\n"Citizens of the Reich, today is a sad day for our country. As Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler has refused to cede command and face due trial for his actions during the war which tore our country asunder, he is immediately relieved of any office and is to be arrested on sight for treason and mass murder.

SPEERUSA.73.desc:0 "Foreign Minister Schmidt and his diplomatic entourage have arrived on the East Coast and have begun a sweeping tour across many of our coastal states. From hunting in the vast woods of northern Maine, to visiting the native-created Etowah Mounds in Georgia, to touring towns, factories, and other landmarks all over the Eastern Seaboard, the Germans have hopefully garnered a much better understanding of American culture and livelihood. We have at the very least given the foreign minister a highly interesting trip, and hopefully the hospitality we've shown to the representatives of our ostensible enemies will bear fruit in the form of improved relations."
SPEERUSA.73.a:0 "Where will he visit next?"

SPEERUSA.74.t:0 "Schmidt in DC"
SPEERUSA.74.desc:0 "The final stop of his goodwill tour, German Foreign Minister Schmidt has arrived in Washington, D.C. From what we have heard from staffers present with the German delegation, the uncontested highlight of the visit for Mr. Schmidt was his stop at the (admittedly very lovely) Lincoln Memorial. /n/n Despite the supposedly much more impressive works and exhibits of Germania, Schmidt was apparently mesmerized by the statue and stood silently in its presence for several minutes. According to one staffer who was known to embellish his stories, a single teardrop could even be seen in Mr. Schmidt's eye. Either way, he seemed to very much appreciate the memorial and the great American values it stands for."
SPEERUSA.74.a:0 "The Nazi foreign minister admires Lincoln? Probably a good sign."

SPEERUSA.75.t:0 "Schmidt in the Lincoln Memorial"
SPEERUSA.75.desc:0 "This was perhaps the one American landmark Schmidt had seen whose scope even held a candle to the landmarks of Germania. And yet somehow, the Lincoln Memorial put the massive statues and displays of Germany's capital to shame. While the ancient Greek-style building and the huge statue of Abraham Lincoln were by no means simple, the memorial could hardly be considered elaborate or covered in interesting details to examine. But all of the pieces put together- the dimly lit but noble Lincoln sitting pleasantly in his chair, overlooking the steps leading down towards the reflecting pool and the Washington Monument in the distance... it evoked this... feeling inside of Schmidt. /n/n/ It was longing. Longing for better days, simpler times, and for leaders with as much honour and integrity as they used to have. No German politician valued liberty (openly) the way Abraham Lincoln did. Why did those in charge today care so damn much about what individuals said or did in the privacy of their own home or in the confidence of loved ones and friends? It was both immensely perplexing and infuriating to Schmidt. And then he realized what he longed for the most: a free and just world. /n/n/ "Ah yes, because it's that simple and easy... Though I admit the world would be pretty boring if there was nothing I could do to make it a better place." Abraham Lincoln did not reply to Schmidt, but surely he would approve."
SPEERUSA.75.a:0 "And make it a better place, I shall."

SPEERUSA.78.desc:0 "For security reasons, the press had not been allowed in. In fact, the room was dauntingly empty, with just some security personnel, a few diplomats from both parties, and Schmidt and the American president sitting together at the table. /n/nWhile all of the details of the treaty that would be signed had already been sorted out, Schmidt was understandably still stressed about this evening. This moment was not to be taken lightly. /n/n Small talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever. /n/n Later, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany. "If we can't kill each other, we might as well trade, no?" cracked Schmidt, getting plenty of laughs despite the unfortunate degree of truth buried in the joke."

SPEERUSA.79.desc:0 "United States of America was stretched out before them in all its glory. Von Tresckow stood to the left side of the table, his crossed arms betraying the inscrutable expression on his face. Opposite him, Schörner leant over the map, his shadow expanding across the East Coast. He greeted the Führer with a courteous smile that failed to reach his eyes. The two officers saluted in unison with a simultaneous, "Heil!"\n\n Speer returned the gesture and stared at the map with a furrowed brow. "Let's hear your proposal, Generalfeldmarschall." He trusted the man little, and his military strategies less, but Speer knew better than to deny an audience with a man so influential in the militarist movement.\n\n "My proposal is simple," Schörner boasted, almost dismissively. He waved his hand generally across the land below him. "Warfare is fought in the mind as well as the battlefield. It's one thing to throw empty words at the Jews in the White House; it's quite another to strike true fear into their craven hearts." The hawk jabbed his finger close to the East Coast, and for a fleeting moment Speer thought he was about to argue for a declaration of war against the United States. "We should fly our strategic bombers straight towards internationally recognized American airspace, before turning away at the last moment! True fear will grip the Americans, and their leaders will be on paranoid alert, never knowing when a first strike is truly coming. I call it 'Schwarze Walküre'."\n\n"Herr Speer, this is far too risky!" Von Trescow shook his head in disbelief. Schörner glared at him with the shards of ice lurking behind his spectacles."What if our pilots fail to turn away in time? What if the Americans act prematurely?"\n\n "These mongrels slighted the Reich!" Schörner snapped, his spittle spraying across the map. "They're not stupid enough to retaliate, but it will teach them a lesson they won't forget."\n\nSpeer silently rubbed his chin in thought. Fully implementing Schwarze Walküre would be a powerful show of strength, but a test run elsewhere would certainly be safer. Iceland, perhaps?"

The test was a success, with all missiles succeeding in their launch, accuracy and detonation over the Atlantic Ocean. The fantastic display of Aryan ingenuity was televised to cheering German audiences across the Reich. Germany, as always, remains superior to all in her firepower. \n\n However, a second goal was achieved today. Across the Eastern Seaboard, American families cower in front of their televisions, as an equally terrified President addresses the nation. \n\n From Berlin, Speer watches the American address, grinning.

The pilot didn't even need to glance, but he did anyway. Yep, a German squadron was still hanging a bit above and behind the strat bombers. At least another dozen pings were picked on the onboard radar up further behind them. Likely, no, definitely above.100% out of sight, but not out of mind.\n\n "Command, I have visual on five escorts, picking up at least another dozen on my radar, over." A pause.

"No running in the hallway!" he announced sternly to the forty or so elementary children. It took more willpower than he cared to admit to not crack a smile as his students let out the barrage of humble sorrys and yes Herrs.\n\n The day was warm and sunny; it was a beautiful day to play ball. The teacher watched from the sideline, occasionally passing back a ball kicked out of bounds. Johann felt at ease here at school. Although scars maimed his face,, anyone who knew Johann could vouch for his giant heart. Johann was always calm, and tried his hardest to be fair and kind, to great success. Though they wouldn't admit it to his face, his students only sang praise about their teacher to his co-workers and their parents, to Johann's embarrassment. Still, it was welcome praise; the children gave him purpose. Although he had lost his pregnant wife in the civil war, being a mentor to the next generation of Germans gave Johann hope. Here he was, helping to raise a new generation, and he did so with much kindness. In a way, they were his family. He did however envy the children; not having to join a Nazi chapter to have friends or to particapate in the football clubs. They didn't have to know party politics to be able to swim at the local pool, nor they weren't judged by their devotion (or lack of) to Hitler's cult of personality. They could be children. It was a wonderful time to be young, and he was glad that he fought for that.\n\n The sound of jets roaring overhead nearly made Johann flinch, his reflexes almost taking control over his body, even after all these years. He took a deep breath. He had to stay composed for the children.\n\n Johann looked above, watching yet another airwing soar above his head, heading northwest, likely following the last hundred or so plans that came before that week. Another batch of strategic bombers. Worrying.\n\n As the children cheered and waved at the soaring planes above, the seed of worry in his head grew more. Why was there so much traffic in the air? Why were they all moving northwest? He pondered as the planes flew out of sight. A ball hit his leg.\n\n "Herr Steiner, can you pass the ball?" A little girl yelled from across the field. He passed the ball, now absent minded, his smile and good mood gone."

The man hung up the phone. "God damn Germans..." Smith muttered.\n\n No more than a minute passed before the President stormed into the Situation Room with their Secret Service attachment stalking close behind.\n\n "Who has my briefing?" The President barked. Shit. The currently overworked staff simply had no time to compile a folder. "Over here, sir!" Smith called as he rushed frantically from his desk to the map in the middle of the room. The President quickly stalked over to the large table, where tokens representing airplanes stood placed in the North Sea, red marker scrawls noting the planes' previous locations and their intended route; Iceland. Smith paced around the table, clearly nervous. "Sorry sir, we didn't have time to..." The President waved him off. "Forget the paperwork. What's the situation?" "Well sir..."\n\n "Five German strategic bombers, nuclear capable, are en-route to our bases in Iceland. NORAD has been tracking them for twenty minutes; they figured it was a long distance training mission. However, they haven't stopped their approach, and are heading right for our airspace. We've already scrambled an interceptor wing." A pause. "How many German planes total?" the President asked. "Is it a probe? A full scale invasion? Something else?" The Preisdents voice rose. "What the hell is this?"  Another tense second passed. "We don't know, sir." Smith replied flatly. "There looks to be twenty-five planes total,  including the five bombers. NORAD has no idea what their intent is, but they are REALLY stressing that those planes are nuclear capable. Most of that staff want us to hit them now to prevent a potential bombing. Most of the guys here..." Smith motioned to the ten or so men feverishly plotting routes and making phone calls. "...including myself believe that the Germans are making a show of strength and have no intent on crossing our airspace. We don't think they're trying to start a war. Still, our response is up to you, Mr. President, and I need your decision, now. An operator in Iceland is waiting for an answer."\n\n The President wordless walked to the nearest desk and dialed a number. The line immediately picked up. "Smith! The fucking Germans are ten minutes out! I need a goddamn answer, now!" Over the line, yelling and the sound of chaos rang in the background. "This is the President..." The line went silent. As if on cue, the background chatter died as if the call was on speaker. The Situation Room mirrored the silence. The President glaced around the room.

Eighteen of the twenty escorts, shot down. No pilots recovered, and no word from the Americans if they rescued any. I don't know what would be better; writing the letters to the families of brave men killed in defense of the Reich, or having to talk to the Americans about returning our men they captured. This is a disaster." The Führer sighed. "What the hell are we going to do?"\n\n Schörner pulled a folder that he had tucked away, and handed it to Speer. The Führer wordlessly opened the folder and read the proposal. A moment of silence passed.\n\n "Wow. The gall of you, Schörner." Schörner finally spoke. "This was an act of war. The militarists are up in arms and demand decisive action. There is no other..." "Are you fucking mad, man?" Speer snapped. Dropping his voice, "This would start a fucking war! Are you willing to give up everything for postering, for you and the military's ego?"\n\n Schörne glanced at his feet, then looked up. "If we don't respond... we look terribly weak on the foreign stage, and God knows what happens at home if we do NOTHING. That's why we chose Iceland. Small population, but important enough to show the world not to underestimate us. Ever.\n\n Speer's head dropped. "My Führer, it's a hard choice, but with your word, we can strike back tonight.

The room cheered; all approaching bombers had been splashed. This was followed shortly by, "Enemy fighters engaging, returning fire." The room sat in silence as the dogfight commenced over a thousand miles from the White House. Smith's stomach sank as a young man screamed "I'm hit, I'm hit!" before breaking up. Another American pilot, although calm, reported the same. He at least managed to confirm "Bailing out." before losing radio contact. The American fighters were quick to respond, twelve American interceptors who had been observing near their operational height limit dove down unto the approaching German formation, quickly scattering them, decisively changing the balance of power.\n\n After only half an hour, the crisis was over. The Germans just couldn't regain the initiative, and after a dozen confirmed kills, the rest of the formation scattered back to Germany. Both American fighters who had been shot down were promptly recovered, along with several Germans. The mood back in the White House wasn't enthusiastic, however.

Walter Dowling looks at the same time incensed by the rebuttal, but intrigued by the way the question had been put. "Surely democracy is better than all other forms of government!" is his immediate reply, "Men were born to be free, Helmut, and democracy is the only way such natural instinct can be satisfied: under a tyranny, there will always be resistance, and its eventual collapse is a matter of time"\n\nSchmidt understands that by talking in absolutes, this would lead nowhere, so he smiles courteously to his guest, and answers: "And yet the Reich is the result of democracy's failure, Walter. The democratic government of Weimar wasn't able to answer to the demands of the German people, and so it was replaced by a government which could meet such demands of order and rebirth. The results of this are well-known, and I believe I don't need to reminisce the events of the past two decades with you, my friend" he says, putting a bit of accent on the word "friend"\n\nDowling understands that going down this road may as well lead to the visit's failure, and also he has been taken aback by the German's point of view, so he decides to end the debate and directs an equally courteous smile towards Schmidt: "Indeed, our world is far more complex than what we would want to, isn't it? But enough politics, I have a sudden craving for more roasted meat, could I have a second serving?" and the Reichsminister internally sighs in relief as the dinner quickly advances towards its successful conclusion.""

A U-boat has launched its payload, painting Iceland red with its fierce nuclear glow; brighter than the sun, more brilliant than the stars, and hotter than Hell itself.\n\n Speer and his top advisors sat in a conference room, waiting. A minute passed, then two. After three, cautious optimism started to spread. Was Schörner right after all? Would the Americans blink first? Another minute. The tension could be cut with a knife. Five. Six. After seven, a faceless administrator cracked a half-hearted joke. Eight, nine. Finally, ten minutes. The ten longest minutes in human history passed with a collective, optimistic sigh of relief. An impromptu toast was raised to Führer Speer.\n\n Sieg Hail!" went the cry! And the men drank. To the bold, to the Reich, and to their fearless leader, who had redeemed their honor and avenged their recent dead; those pilots who did not return from their sortie to Iceland. Speer himself even partook, with a thin smile dancing on his lips. The Reich avenged her sons, her honor restored. Another victory for the Fatherland, perhaps her greatest yet! Who would dare to face her?\n\n A senior officer rushed into the merry conference room, breathless and white as a ghost. "They're launching! They're launching everything!" \n\n Of course,the staff, the petty bureaucrats and the oh-so-tough warmongerers fled to the bunker complexes. The sirens sounded, but it would be for naught. Speer knew that the missiles would strike with their deadly payloads within fifteen minutes. It was hardly any time for the citizens to reach the few bunkers scattered across Germany. Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind. As the ground heaved beneath his feet, he had one duty he needed to yet fulfil. He owed it to his people.\n\n The Führer found Schörner standing besides a grand window facing north. Speer joined him. Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n "So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence. Yet Speer could not speak. In another twenty minutes, he knew the Reich, HIS Reich, his home, would be ash. There wasn't even time for enough people to make it to the bunkers to fill them. The streets were eerily empty, and other than the cry of the sirens and the sporidic booms of approaching doom, the heart of Germany was deathly silent. The city awaited her final judgement..\n\n "This is it. This is how it ends," he spoke again. A moment of silence passed. The ground suddenly jerked; another blast rocked the earth, so violently that the glass in front of the men cracked and buckled. Neither man flinched. Schörner was the first to turn and walk, presumably to the safety of the bunkers.\n\n "This is what you wanted, right?" Schörner stopped, and turned back to face his leader, who had tears welling in his eyes. "Well, how did we do, General? Did we play the part well?" he spat."

A loud bang closely followed by the sound of breaking glass came from the other side of the door. A curse, then silence. Schörner knocked.\n\n What the hell do you idiots want?!" Speer screamed.

It was clear that Albert Speer was in a rage; something Schörner  had never seen from the usually calm and collected man. Files and papers were strewn everywhere. A full sized mirror in the corner of the room was shattered into a million pieces, specks of blood strewn nearby. Pacing back and forth behind his desk was a disheveled Albert Speer, blood trickling down from his cut knuckles. He looked up and paused; his facing darkening when he realized just who had entered.\n\n "You." Speer spoke, then paused. Schörner, for once, had nothing to say. "Make your report, and make it quick."\n\n "My Führer," he began. For once, he spoke those words without any trace of comptemet. For once, the two were in complete agreement with what had to be done. There was no backing down now. "The U-Boats are off the coast of Iceland, as ordered. They are standing by on your..." \n\n Speer cut him off. "Did I not give you simple, easy, God damn instructions?" His tone was quieter now, but menacing. It was as if venom came from his lips.\n\n "Ah, uh, yes, sir." Schörner replied without stumbling over too many of his words. Describing Speer as 'frustrated' was definitely an understatement.\n\n "The caption refused the codes from me. Said procedure required him to hear the orders from your mouth." Speer merely stared at the general. Schörner, for his part, remained calm. He walked forwards with his typical confidence and handed Speer a note with a number on it. "The direct line, sir." Speer immediately punched the numbers into his land line.\n\n "Captain Von Steiner, reporting." The voice on the other end spoke calmly, as if rehearsed a thousand times."

The planes launched from Germany, came within a thousand meters of their airspace, then abruptly turned back, with no complications. In fact, there were even no mechanical issues. Everything went perfectly, in every sense of the word.  "What is the response from the Americans?" \n\n "Officially, none, my Führer. Unofficially?

Maybe to show strength. But from men like Charles Lindburg, these incursions were a pain in the ass. Because every week, the Germans did the same thing; five strategic bombers with twenty or so escorts flew towards an OFN base or airspace, and every time they did this, NORAD had to respond as if the Germans were about to strike. Planes had to be mobilized on next to no notice, bases had to be mobilized, and the Armed Forces freaked out. Every. God. Damn. Time.\n\n Lindburg was sick of it. His colleges were sick of it. The Navy man on the phone was pissed off and sick of it. But, everyone understood that, knowing the Germans, the one time NORAD doesn't react to a threat seriously would be the one time the Germans struck an OFN base. Life is fickle like that.\n\n The man in the phone continued to yell. "Twenty five! Twenty five bogies heading towards MY airspace! I want thirty, no, fifty interceptors circling above my HQ in ten minutes!" A loud BANG emitted from the phone. Lindburg winced and rubbed his ear as he put the cold plastic back on its base. What a prick. Lindburg didn't even rise from his desk; they were already scrambling nearly two dozen interceptors; no other fighters were close enough to respond within twenty minutes.

Today would be his trial by fire, the first mission. A voice cut over the radio.\n\n "Falcon squad, this is 2-7, you are cleared to engage priority targets. Over." Yes! It was time to shine!  Ever so gracefully, the pilot dipped his plane into a sharp dive.\n\n "2-9, this is 2-7. Do not break formation. I repeat, do not break formation. Over." Fuck. So much for glory. Dejectly, he flipped a switch. Instantly, G-force pushed him back into his seat as the air-brakes engaged. In three seconds, he was back in formation. Patience. The cockpit started to beep as he locked onto one of the titanic bombers. Seven missiles streamed from the Americans, the young man's missile making eight. The air-to-air missiles streamed past, leaving nothing but a red glare in their wake. He watched. Would he be so....\n\n "Yes!" he shouted as his, and his missile alone smashed into a bomber in the rear. Confirmed kill. Hell yeah. The triumph was short-lived. Over a dozen German fighters dove from above as the five escorts close to the bombers scattered, but not before launching their own barrage of missiles. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. A missle streamed right towards his plane. Shit. He slammed the joystick up in an attempt to evade. His reaction was quick, and almost perfect. In fact, if the green rookie hadn't been so fast, the missile would have flown straight into his cockpit; he would have been incinerated instantly. Instead, the midsection of the plane took the brunt of the damage. The jet started to spin helplessly out of control, rolling on all axes. "THIS IS 2-9! I'M HIT, I'M HIT! I'M GOING DOWN!" He looked at his consul in panic. No power. Had anyone heard him?\n\n The plane was in a hopeless tailspin, next to no control, losing altitude fast. Way too fast. The plane wouldn't stop rolling for a safe ejection. He would have to time this perfectly. He prayed as he grabbed the ejection lever. Would it work? Would he time the erratic movements of the plane just right? The plane spun right side up. He pulled the lever. Nothing.\n\n The plane tilted about ninety degrees before the canopy popped off and the seat ejected. A sideways ejection. SHIT. The man almost cried as he looked down at the fast approaching water. Is this how he died, on his first mission? No...no. Not like this. The pilot threw all of his body weight back, and miraculously, the chair leveled right side up. Quickly, he deployed the backup parachute.... which immediately deployed. Battered and bruised, the rookie would survive to fight another day."

To the bold, to the Reich, and to their fearless leader, who had redeemed their honor and avenged their recent dead; those pilots who did not return from their sortie to Iceland.

In the center of the room, a group of men paced around the map of Western Europe, still red from the marking that charted the German air wing the airforce decimated.\n\n The President burst into the room, still sweaty from his run from the other side of the White House. Normally, people would stop and give them their respects. Today, the President was like any other person; not immediately important to their work, so not important enough to greet. The President scanned the room, and saw a familiar face pointing and writing in a notebook. What was his name... Smith?\n\n "What's the word on the ground?" the President asked as he approached the three men. Two of them scattered, running back to their desks while Smith feverishly lined out potential strike areas in Iceland. "You know as much as me, sir." Smith replied, still working. "Two minutes ago, a German submarine off the coast of Iceland rose to about a hundred meters and launched twelve ballistic missiles at Iceland." He finished tracing lines on the map. "Really? Speer would be so brazen?" Smith shrugged.\n\n "SMITH, SMITH, GET OVER HERE!" a nameless man yelled close by. Smith rushed over. The man punched a button on his phone, and the line went on speaker.\n\n "They're nuclear! I repeat, the missiles are nuclear! Reykjavik has been hit! We have no...." The President zoned out. Wordlessly, he found an empty stool around the war map and sat. After a minute, Smith walked back to the table, and wrote an X on all of the major harbors, cities, and most of the U.S bases and garrisons. Twelve red Xs scarred the map as nuclear fire likewise scarred Iceland. The Situation Room was dead quiet. Finally, Smith spoke.\n\n "Have we tried to raise the airforce in Iceland?" One man wordlessly rose his hand, then shook his head. "Nothing sir."\n\n Three minutes passed before an aerial reconansion confirmed their worst fears; the United States had been struck with nuclear arms.\n\n "Sir." Smith approached the President, who had yet to speak since the strike. "What...what do we do?" Quiet. Silence. Finally, a sigh. "I thought Speer was a reformer. Now look where we're at. Christ. God."

While the Gang of Four is pleased by this development, as they know it will greatly help the fair's success, their opponents in the government accuse them openly of "betraying Hitler's legacy" and "selling our country for a few dollars" with several high-ranking party officials and bureaucrats signing an official request to the Führer to step in and "stop this madness"\n\nAs letter of protest pile on his desk at the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer can't help but understand the plight of the protesters. The Gang of Four clearly stands for something different that what he believes in, for something different from national socialism, and this fact sometimes infuriates him: if he could solve all of Germany's problem by removing those four bastards, he would have done that ages ago! Sadly, it isn't so simple: each of them is the best of the best in what they do, and even he has to admit they all love the Vaterland in their own, flawed way, and want to see it reborn, if under a different form.\n\nSighing, he takes another letter and reads it. He would like to simply throw them into the dustbin, but doing so would only enrage his own party even more. As he takes up the pen to answer the missive, he writes the same words for the umpteenth time: "Sehr geehrter Sekretär, though I understand your displeasure, and to some extent I even share it, the greatness of the Vaterland requires small sacrifices such as these to ensure we retake our legitimate place among the world powers.

At each junction, an eagle's head juts out, holding a flag with the Swastika to remember the battles fought between the contenders of the Bürgerkrieg.\n\nOf the four spirals, three interrupt roughly five meters before the top, where the last one turns from the usual color of steel to pure gold, just as Führer Speer managed to prevail over the flawed ideologies of his rivals and show how National Socialism was meant to be. Finally, the spiral reaches the top, where it flattens into a platform sustaining a golden swastika upon which stands perched Fritz Koenig's masterpiece, a massive eagle with its wings spread looking over Boston as a predator looks upon its prey.\n\nAs the entire Reich rejoices for such a display of national pride, we are sure to march towards a resounding success in Boston!"

Not all of them were too memorable, but one drama in particular starring a renowned comedy actor named Heinz Rühmann seemed to strike a chord with its audience. /n/n Perhaps, if relations do continue to improve, there could be a strong collaboration between our film industries, which could ultimately even lead to a strengthening of cultural ties between the US and Germany.

The site was covered head to toe in swastika-themed paraphernalia, which was a huge mistake considering that Americans do not react positively to the symbol they've learned to hate after years of German conquest and American propaganda. /n/n While the actual quality of the cultural and scientific displays was very impressive, the fair simply seemed to portray the Germans as humourless fanatics, which doesn't bode too well for our attempts to improve their image in the minds of the American people.

Indeed, it was this exact reason why the man silently stood against the wall, waiting for his comrades to join him.\n\nOne by one, they made their way out of the blocks they called home, sneaking over to the same wall and avoiding the lazy flashlight beams that occasionally flicked down the road. When the last conspirator, a man of slim frame, squeezed out of the hole in the wall of his barracks and slid over to the wall, the first man blew a sigh of relief. He was the one that the first man had prayed would return.\n\n "So, Rasmus. How did they respond?"\n\n"Wing A is ready. They're practically chomping at the bit to go now."\n\nThe second man barely held in a laugh of glee. "Holy shit, it's really all coming together! I never thought I'd see the day we all grew balls and went after the Germans!"\n\n "It's a goddamn miracle, Mykyta." Said the third man, a faint smile crossed his lips.

Of course, he was sure the executives who watched over it all didn't mind- less disturbances meant more productivity. Now, however, the guard had his chance to finally enjoy the power of his job.\n\nThe other slaves seemed to part like a wave as he pushed his way through to the offender, an older man who the guard had seen- and punished- many times before. Splayed out across the floor lay the box of tools the slave had been using. A foolish error, and one that would not go unpunished, thought the guard.\n\n"Pick that up." stated the guard, pointing to a wrench that lay close to his feet. The man did not move. The guard smirked- a rebellious streak had always been apparent in this one. He resolved to teach him a few lessons in manners as he pulled out his baton. Quickly and forcefully, he pushed the man back with it, planting the tip squarely in the slave's sternum.\n\n"Pick it up, boy." The guard said again, louder and more threatening than before. Still, the man did not move. The guard responded by striking the man to the ground with a swing from the baton. Finally, the slave crawled over to the wrench and picked it up, standing as he did so. The guard smiled, his victory confirmed.\n\nHis smile would remain on his face up until the slave, whirling around, slammed the wrench directly into his jaw.\n\nHe collapsed to the ground, stars whirling around his vision. In a mix of anger and rage, he reached for his gun, raising it towards the rebellious ingrate. His shot went wild into the ceiling as a multitude of hands grabbed him, knocking him back to the floor and wrestling the pistol from his hands. Across the factory floor, the sounds of chaos replaced the previous silence, and the guard could only wonder how long the slaves had waited for this day before he lost consciousness."

speerflavor.3.d:0 "In the chaos of the Kruppstrasse, one man made his way quickly through the crowd of slaves. Jan still held the wrench that had started the whole affair close to his chest as he pushed through the turmoil, searching for his fellow leaders. It was a difficult task, made more difficult by those who recognized him trying to give their compliments and praise. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of pushing and shoving, he reached the other three. Mykyta, Mikhail, and Rasmus all stood on a metal catwalk above the street, watching as hundreds of slaves either made a break for freedom, grabbed weapons from the now wide-open doors of the factory armories, or barricaded the streets in preparation for the inevitable police response. As Jan joined them, Rasmus's eyes locked onto a chain of guards and executives, all being led into one factory as hostages. They were not the only ones.\n\n"-took longer than we thought to clear out Wing 4, but we got it in the end - look at that, it's the man of the hour." Rasmus turned to Jan, a smile crossing his face. "How'd Wing 2 go, Jan?"\n\n "Perfect. I really nailed the son of a bitch who went after me. If you guys see a guard with a fucked-up mouth, tell him I said hello. How about you fellows?"\n\n"Wing 1 and 3 went smoothly as well" Mikhail chimed in, "though Wing 4 took a little longer than we hoped. The men there didn't realize we had started until the guards began locking the place down. In any case, the whole plan succeeded so far."\n\nThe men looked back down onto the street, watching the turmoil. Jan's eyes latched onto one group of slaves, currently making a break for it out into Frankfurt. They reached the corner where the Kruppstrasse turned onto another street, then froze. Suddenly, each of them dashed back to the barricades, inaudibly shouting. A wave of commotion swept through those who still were inside the barricades.\n\nAs each of the leaders turned towards the frenzy, the source of the chaos became apparent. 3 police cars sped past the corner, sliding to a stop with a screech of tires. They sped off just as quickly when a hail of panicked gunshots rained down the street, bullets pinging off their cars as they got out of the area.The 4 men looked at each other, each realizing what was to come.\n\n"I'll get defenses set up." Mykyta said, turning to the stairs. "Be prepared for anything. And, brothers, if this becomes our last stand, make sure to take as many of them with you as you can."\n\nThe men said nothing. There was work to be done."

speerflavor.4.t:0 "No Everyday Patrol"
speerflavor.4.d:0 "Johann's patrol car was not used to moving so quickly, and screeched its protest to being treated so roughly at every corner. Inside the car, Johann himself listened intently to the police radio- even with his full attention directed onto it, it was a struggle to make out independent facts or statements with the amount of information flowing in. Tales of escaping slaves causing havoc through Frankfurt- Johann swerved to avoid a scattering group of them as he listened- were swiftly cut off by reports of general chaos, multiple gunshots, and an increasingly flustered radio operator trying in vain to restore order on the airwaves. None of this mattered to Johann- he had his orders, and he already knew what he was supposed to do.\n\n2 patrol cars, evidently headed to the same location as he was, fell in behind him as he continued to roar down the main avenues. Cars lay abandoned at the side of the road as the police cars roared past, evidence of the growing chaos that was engulfing the industrial side of town. Finally, Johann and the others pulled up to the perimeter that had been set up, and witnessed a scene of pure chaos.\n\nWhile the street itself was empty- the police presence had been enough to scare any running slaves back to their holes- a full block had been abandoned to the rebellion, with the perimeter having been set up just around the corner from where the rebellious factory was located. Worried, angry, and above all else confused officers chattered to each other, setting up their own police barricade. Curious onlookers watched anxiously from windows and balconies, though they made sure to be out of the way of any potential gunfire. Johann stepped out of his car and made his way to the nearest face he recognized. The sergeant quickly snapped to attention as he saw the captain approach.\n\n"Wachtmeister Schneider. Status report, if you will." Johann said curtly.\n\n"It's like nothing I've ever seen before, Oberstleutnant. They've flipped containers and made them barricades, they've boarded up doors and windows, they've got weapons everywhere- they've built a damn fortress." Schneider panted. Johann kept walking, heading towards the corner that stood between the police and the revolters. He stuck his head around for a moment to confirm what Schneider had said.\n\nEven though Johann had fought in the Civil War, his mouth nearly fell open at the spectacle of a barricade, defended by slaves still in their working clothes, armed to the teeth with rifles, pistols, and shotguns. It, indeed, was like nothing he had ever seen before. His shock was so great that it took Schneider to pull him back around the corner when multiple bullets cracked off the wall.\n\n"Herr Oberstleutnant, you see what I mean, yes?" Schneider asked. Johann stayed silent for a moment, then responded."

speerflavor.5.t:0 "Emergency Meeting"
speerflavor.5.d:0 "Speer wanted to bury his face in his hands. Of course this would happen to him. The only time a slave revolt ever succeeds, and it's under him. Across from him sat the men of the Gang of Four, each looking similarly downtrodden as Speer. Next to them sat Hans Speidel, calm as always, though his uncomfortable fidgeting did betray a hint of worry. Each of these men would occasionally look over to the phone on Speer's desk, which at any second was all but certain to ring with the voice of Ferdinand Schörner. Speer could already imagine the look of glee on Schörner's face as he heard the news, and he shuddered to think of the tongue-lashing that would come.\n\n"So." Speer quietly said,"How many slaves were in the factory?"\n\nHelmut fidgeted uncomfortably. "Around 800, my Führer."\n\n"Christ." Speer sighed. "And how many do we estimate are still fighting?"\n\nA long, uncomfortable silence punctuated the air as each of the men in the office looked at each other. Finally, Speidel spoke up."We estimate between 200 and 300, but there's no way of knowing how many are inside the wings."\n\nSpeer audibly groaned. "I don't see why we don't move in, take the factory back, end this mess.\n\n"With the amount of hostages they've got in there?" Schmidt questioned. "We'll be lucky if we get ten of them out alive if we throw the Wehrmacht in." \n\n"Besides that," Kiesenger interrupted, "We've already received some ground reports that students from nearby universities are aiding escaping slaves hide from police patrols. Their reaction to a full-blown shootout may be. . .ugly."\n\n"Must we speak of the politics of the matter? This is the worst hostage crisis we've faced in our history." Speidel interjected. "Now, if you would allow me, I have a plan-"\n\nThe phone rang, and each of the men tensed. Slowly, Speer picked it up. He listened for a moment, then held the receiver away from his ear to notify the others."
speerflavor.5.a:0 "It's Schörner."

speerflavor.6.t:0 "Schörner's Plan"
speerflavor.6.d:0 ""Herr Schörner, please, calm yourself."\n\n"My Führer, I will calm myself when the situation is no longer so volatile. For now, we are looking at the worst slave revolt in years! How could you expect any good citizen to be calm in such a situation?"\n\nThe 5 other men in the room could barely make out Schörner's voice, tinny and canned as it was. Speer himself could hear all too much of it- the Field Marshal was practically screaming into his ear. He leaned back in his chair, distancing himself from the receiver. If he didn't, the urge to hang up on the man would eventually overpower him.\n\n"So what's your suggestion, Ferdinand? I'm sure I can guess the gist of it." He asked. There was a moment of silence on the other end, and the rest of the room leaned in to hear it better.\n\n"Send in the tanks, the armored cars, the planes, the Wehrmacht. Take them out-" Each of the men in the room reacted in their own special way. Schmidt threw his hands up in the air, Speidel sighed, and the other men of the Gang exchanged looks of displeasure. Speer, however, remained silent."-as fast as you can, casualties be damned. If we give them even an inch, they'll take a mile, and we'll lose control in days."\n\n"We'll consider it." Speer flatly stated, placing the phone face up on his desk. Schörner's continued rant went unnoticed in the commotion that followed.\n\n In a moment, the Gang began to shout over one another in their objections. Cries of "Murderer", "Pig", and "Idiot", which Speer decided to assume were directed at Schörner, rebounded through the room. Speer's face remained unmoved. Finally, Speidel stood, and the rest of the men silenced themselves.\n\n"My Führer, I think you should hear me out before you make any choices on the matter. I believe your council has a suggestion as well, judging by that. . .outburst." Speidel stated. The Gang, led by Schmidt, voiced their agreement."
speerflavor.6.a:0 ""Very well. Speak, Herr Speidel.""

speerflavor.7.t:0 "Speidel's Plan"
speerflavor.7.d:0 "Hans Speidel took a deep breath. Each of the men around him watched his every move, his every twitch. He made sure to minimize any nervous fidgeting before he began.\n\n"My proposal is similar to the Field Marshal's proposal, though I will say it is more refined than the blunt solution my colleague provides. In short, there is no way that this situation can be dealt with in such a. . .heavy handed way, if you wish to keep casualties low. However, if we negotiate, we give in to the slaves and their threats. Every slave in the Reich will see us give in and assume that they can do the same. We'll see revolts across Germany within a month if we give in, mark my words."\n\n"You coward! What you suggest would take far too long to do. The news will be all over Germany by the time your plan is ready, and then-" Schörner shouted to make himself audible through the phone. Speer paused for a moment to listen before motioning for Speidel to continue, placing his hand over the speaker to muffle the noise.\n\n"My suggestion would be to take a slow, cautious, yet tough approach on these slaves. An infiltration, coordinated with our best units, could potentially result in catching the rebels off guard. If we do this right, we could seize control of the factories without too much bloodshed. My top men have already begun drawing out a plan, if you wish for it."\n\n"You idiot. You're ruling out even trying to negotiate because of what you think will happen? You're no better than the butcher on the other end of that telephone." Schmidt loudly objected. The rest of the Gang nodded, though their reaction was much less strong than that of Schmidt.\n\n"I'm not suggesting we go in and kill all of them, Helmut, I'm suggesting we put this down before it spreads!" Speidel wheeled around angrily. A shouting match erupted before Speer, with a hearty slap of his table, brought everyone to order. He sighed before turning to Schmidt."

speerflavor.8.t:0 "Schmidt's Proposal"
speerflavor.8.d:0 "Schmidt stood, the rest of the Gang watching him closely. He cleared his throat before he began, making sure to stand as upright as he could. Speer watched him intently as he began.\n\n "My Führer, while the other proposals that your generals have brought before us could certainly hold some merit, the fact remains that they are simply too harsh to be considered. If we pull off any form of military maneuver against the slaves, the liberals you rely on so heavily will explode. After all, would such an oppressive maneuver not directly contradict your supposed wish to free the slaves? No, if you wish to come out of this with your hide intact, you must come to the table with the slaves. This doesn't mean we have to give in to all their demands, of course, but a negotiation would certainly go down well with your base. Besides, while Herr Speidel seems to think negotiation would encourage revolt, I believe it would have the opposite effect. After all, would the slaves not believe you truly mean what you say if you talk to a revolting group?"\n\nSchörner's voice cut in at a volume loud enough for all to hear. "You traitor! You imbecilic fool! You think the slaves can be negotiated with? You think this WON'T encourage lawlessness? My Führer, I cannot stand with such a ridiculously stupid action!"\n\nSpeidel uncomfortably cut in on Schörner's continued rant. "While it pains me to say it, I have to agree with Schörner on this point. Negotiation, as I said, only breeds further revolt. To give in is to set the precedent that we are willing to give in to violence and chaos. We'll only see unrest if we give in for stability's sake."\n\nSchmidt did not take this rebuttal lightly. "You only think this because you're too wrapped up in discipline to see the human side of things! We're running out of time to make a decision here, my Führer! If we don't negotiate, blood will run through the streets of Frankfurt, and our claim to reformism and slave freedom will be forever damaged!"\n\nSpeer sat in silence for a moment, running through all the possibilities he could think of. The men in the room stood silently, waiting for a reaction that could change Germany forever."

speerflavor.9.t:0 "Do What We Must"
speerflavor.9.d:0 "The room, which only a second ago was nearly bursting, now flipped to uncomfortable silence. Speer became keenly aware of the stares of disbelief, rage, and disappointment that bored into him. The only noise now was the crackling of the telephone. Speer could even imagine Schörner staring into his receiver in shock.\n\n"Of course, my Führer." Was all that Schörner said before the line went dead with a loud click. Immediately, total chaos consumed the room, quickly rerouted into the lightning rod of pure rage that was Helmut Schmidt.\n\n"You goddamned MADMAN! You just killed 200 innocent souls, you heartless bastard! What sort of reformist are you? Free the slaves, huh? I didn't realize you meant freeing them from the fucking mortal coil!"\n\n "You will show respect to my decisions, Herr Schmidt. I am still your Führer!" Speer rose from his own chair in anger. Schmidt refused to sit down, despite the worried taps on his thigh by Kiesenger.\n\n "You shut the hell up, you two-faced rat! What will the people think!? What will the international community think!? Did you put an iota of thought into this before you chose death for hundreds?"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, you shall not insult me, and you certainly shall not tell me to shut up!"\n\n"I couldn't care less what you say-" Kiesenger shoved Schmidt hard, and the man caught himself. Breathing deeply, Schmidt paused for a moment. His voice strained against his restraint as he continued. "I think it would be best if I retired for the night." With that, Schmidt left the room. The rest of the Gang closely followed, stopping only to glare at Speer, undoubtedly holding their tongues.\n\n "Herr Speidel, I made the right call, you must understand. The Heer can't think we're going too far, and the conservatives would shred me if I didn't. . ." Speer trailed off. Speidel said nothing, instead briskly turning and exiting, leaving Speer to reflect on his own decision."

speerflavor.10.t:0 "Do What We Can"
speerflavor.10.d:0 "The room processed Speer's words for a moment. A small grin spread across Speidel's face, a frown crossed Schmidt's, and various looks of acceptance flashed across the Gang's face. Slowly, Speer turned to the phone, which now sat deathly silent on the table. All eyes turned to the receiver, as the men braced for the explosion.\n\n After a moment, Speer grew concerned as to what Schörner was up to. "Herr Schörner, did you catch what I said?"\n\nThere was another moment of long, uncomfortable silence. Finally, the tinned voice of the Field Marshal returned. "Loud and clear, my Führer. Know that I am fully against this half hearted weakness." The line shut off with a menacing click.\n\n"My Führer, thank you for seeing reason. I promise you, we will not disappoint you in our endeavors. We'll have results shortly." Speidel turned and exited the room. Speer could almost envision the gears clicking away in Speidel's head, turning fiercely as he began to work on the problem at hand.\n\n"My Führer, while I can't say I'm in support of this measure, I will say it's a better choice than what you could have done. I hope you'll have mercy the next time one of these situations crop up." Schmidt spoke quickly and curtly. Speer could detect a hint of frustration in the man's voice, but said nothing in return. Finally, Schmidt left the room. Each of the other Gang members shared their own thoughts, none particularly positive, before departing. Speer sat alone in his room now, leaning back as he tapped his fingers on the desk. He turned to the window, the night sky sprawling over the Germania skyline. He exhaled a breath he had barely realized he was holding in. To nobody in particular, he said-"
speerflavor.10.a:0 ""I think I handled that well.""

speerflavor.11.t:0 "Do What We Will"
speerflavor.11.d:0 "The room, which had been almost bursting with sound, went dead silent. Speidel's eyes shot to Speer in disbelief, Schmidt's eyes widened, and the rest of the gang's attention quickly shot directly to the phone. The moment of silence would not last for long.\n\nThe telephone on the desk, which had been almost forgotten about in the chaos, quickly grabbed everyone's attention with a screech of static. Schörner's voice, now almost as loud as if he had been in the room, exploded from the speaker so ferociously that the phone nearly rattled off the table.\n\n "My Führer, you can't be serious! Are you truly suggesting that we not only put down a rebellion, but negotiate with them? They're slaves! If we negotiate, we give into decadent, lesser races! We give in to those we own! Do you honestly think that the other slaves will look at us give in to a slave revolt and not get the idea to do the same?"\n\n "Herr Schörner, I've thought this over, and this is the obvious solution if our agenda is to be followed and believed. Besides, your solution is less of a fix and more of a massacre." Speer flatly replied. The look on his face clearly betrayed his opinion on the Field Marshal to the other men in the room.\n\n "My solution may not be weak enough for you bleeding-hearts, but it will work! I cannot, in any way, support such a foolish, naive choice-"\n\n "Well, Herr Schörner, I'll take your complaints into consideration." Speer spat as blandly as possible, before unceremoniously placing the phone back in the receiver. Almost immediately, he was beset upon by Schmidt, who spent the better part of the next 5 minutes praising Speer's choice before rushing from the room, quickly being followed by the gang. Speidel stuck around a little longer to give his thoughts, mostly cautionary words against excessive looseness to revolters, though Speer could tell he was holding back some of his more choice words.\n\nFinally, when everyone was gone, Speer leaned back in his seat and stared out of his window. He couldn't help but think of the fiery speeches against him that were sure to come from all sectors. It was certainly going to hurt him with the Heer and the conservatives. Indeed, he almost regretted his choice for the amount of problems it would open up. At the end of the day, though, at least he knew it was the moral one."

speerflavor.12.d:0 "It had been almost a day since the siege had begun, and there seemed to be no end to the standoff. Mykyta watched from the factory window as his fighters patrolled the barricades, weapons in hand. It had been a very busy 24 hours, but it was certainly some of the most exciting of his entire life. He noticed Mikhail coming up as well, and sighed at the loss of his peace. Mikhail had been jumpy the entire time, pacing the factory for hours.\n\n "What's up?" Mykyta asked Mikhail. Mikhail said nothing, instead lighting his cigarette. Mykyta waited a moment for a response.\n\n "It's not that something's happening, it's that nothing's happening. No negotiation, no infiltration, they're just waiting for something." Mikhail exhaled. \n\nIt was at that moment when an explosion rocked the barricade in front, sending men flying across the compound. In an instant, all was chaos. Gunfire filled the street as Wehrmacht soldiers, dressed in full battle gear, charged the factory. The slaves put up a fight, and both Mikhail and Mykyta saw their fair share of Wehrmacht soldiers fall, but any hope of the attack being repulsed ended when a Leopard, machine guns spitting lead, rolled over the remains of the barricade. Its gun blasted a high explosive shell directly into wing A, blowing apart the flimsy walls of the factory like a house of cards being hit with a sledgehammer.\n\n "Mykyta, I think this is the end." Mikhail said quietly, as more and more vehicles began to overrun the factory. Mykyta was silent for a minute, watching the end of his dreams. The revolt had ended not as he hoped, but as he expected. Now, all that was left was to go out in as much a blaze of glory as they could."

All of them sat in uncomfortable silence, processing the news they had heard.\n\n "Well. Herr Speidel, you have the numbers, correct?" Schmidt took the liberty of starting the conversation, obviously not wanting to let Speer control what was said. Speidel stirred uncomfortably at being prompted by Schmidt, clearly catching on to Schmidt's plan, but went ahead anyway.\n\n "Numbers are incomplete, but, ah, we currently have about 191 slaves confirmed deceased, with about 100 more in custody with various wounds. Wehrmacht casualties are about 35 confirmed KIA, with one armored car disabled- hit by a Molotov. 62 have reported wounds, mostly minor bruises and scratches."\n\n "And, out of the estimated 70 hostages they were holding, how many did we recover?"\n\nSpeidel paused, hesitating to read the result. Finally, he spoke up. "None."\n\n "So that makes, what, about 300 dead? 300 innocent souls lost. Incredible. If only there was some other way we could have gone about this operation-"\n\nSpeer spoke up firmly. "Helmut, we've gone over this. I am not going to-"\n\nHelmut raised his voice over Speer's. "If only we could have negotiated, or taken any other means of attack that wasn't rolling a fucking tank over them!"\n\n "Herr Schmidt, I'm warning you-" Speer raised his voice in return. Schmidt ignored him, instead raising his voice to a near yell.\n\n "But no, this was clearly the right choice, right? 300 dead, but-"\n\n "Herr Schmidt, you are dismissed from this meeting!"

State media, of course, would not be covering such a stunning thing as a slave revolt in full detail (instead framing it as "minor unrest") so the information was passed through word of mouth. Telephones around Germany rang with the tales of gunshots, tanks, and machine guns rattling off, leading to many in universities across the Reich becoming glued to their phones. In Frankfurt itself, students watched from their windows as tank after tank rolled over university avenues and roads. It soon became apparent what they were here to do.\n\nThe massacre may have been ignored by the press, but it certainly wasn't ignored by the people. The telephone lines from Frankfurt nearly jammed with the sheer volume of calls sent across the Reich. In universities from Cologne to Königsberg, the youth of Germany heard uncensored, unfiltered accounts of chaos and death, directly caused by the government they had supported and trusted. Their reaction to the news was as one would expect.\n\nWithin two hours, spontaneous protests had erupted across any city with a major university in it, grinding the streets to a halt.\n\nWithin three hours, the protests were riots, and the police was backed up by whatever Heer forces were on hand.\n\nWithin five hours, the streets were lit by the flames of burnt-out cars and broken Molotovs, and the air was choked with tear gas and smoke.\n\nWithin eight hours, the streets were empty once more, leaving those who had cleared them to pick up the pieces. One thing was clear, though- the student's faith in Speer had shattered, and it was doubtful he could ever regain it."

As he pulled the rubber band off the roll, he could only thank God that one of his friends had managed to strike a deal with a group of sympathetic students. It had let him and his fellow bunkmates stay informed, a luxury that many fellow workers did not possess.\n\nAs his friends gathered around him, he flipped through the first pages.

Finally, almost 20 minutes after the meeting was supposed to begin, Speidel made his way into the room, carrying multiple folders and dropping them on Speer's desk.\n\n "Sorry for my absence, my Führer, but the action report came in later than I expected. I hope you'll forgive the wait." Speidel breathed heavily, finding a seat as soon as he could.

The operation began in earnest at 12:30, concluding at 13:43, though most of the action was finished by 12:42. In this period, 104 revolters were killed, with 187 captured and placed in custody, including all four of their supposed leaders. Wehrmacht casualties were 11 KIA, 24 wounded. Out of the 83 hostages taken, 74 were rescued. Overall, I think it's clear that this was a success."\n\n "Well, hold on there." Schmidt rose to his feet. "Sure, the operation succeeded in its goal, and I'm sure we're all thankful for that. But over a hundred people were still killed- lives that would have been saved if we had negotiated."\n\n "Herr Schmidt, I understand your concern, but I don't think many are weeping for unruly slaves." Speer replied.\n\nSchmidt stared at Speer, ice in his eyes, before sitting back down. The meeting would conclude shortly after."

speerflavor.18.t:0 "The Student Reaction"
speerflavor.18.d:0 "While much of the Reich had been paying at least passive to attention to the drama unfolding in Frankfurt for the last days, none watched more intently or cared as deeply as the students. For the last three days, students in every major university were glued to their phones, waiting for their friends to relay new news from Frankfurt. From there, they would speak to their friends, who would spread it across their dorms. Through this jury-rigged communication line, the students stayed up to date on every movement, every development, every shot. All watched intently for Speer's response- perhaps this was the turning point for him to finally kick up slave retribution to a new level.\n\nTo say that the reports of Wehrmacht storming the factory disappointed and angered the students greatly would be an incredible understatement.\n\nAs the news spread throughout the cities of Germany, so too did the protests. University dorms emptied onto the streets as thousands of enraged students marched on a scale not seen since the chaotic days of '63. Various protest chants filled the air, each different in sound and lyrics, but they each revolved around one theme- betrayal.\n\nThe streets would eventually empty, of course, but the feeling of resentment lingered. Across the Reich, portraits of Speer were silently taken off walls. Posters espousing Speer's ideals slowly disappeared from college campuses. In every campus, the tone of political discourse shifted from idealistic dreaming to bitter disappointment, as once again a leader had betrayed the youth of Germany.\n\nPerhaps it was not as bad as it could have been- a straight invasion of the complex may have driven the students to a riot- but the damage was clear. Speer had let the students down, and never again would they trust him so blindly."

speerflavor.19.t:0 "The Trial"
speerflavor.19.d:0 "The judge rapped his gavel twice, leaning forward to give his final remarks. The audience, hypnotized by the spectacle of it all, leaned forward with him. Indeed, the only four members of the court that seemed untouched by the spell were the defendants, who stared daggers into the judge's robes.\n\n "I believe this court has heard enough. Through the course of this trial, we have heard tales from witness after witness of these slave's brutality. They rose up against the order of things, took arms from the workers of the factory, made hostages of any who dared resist their takeover, and when the time to restore order to the facility came, they brutally murdered numerous brave sons of our Reich! I'm truly saddened that the worst penalty that I can give to these heartless pigs is DEATH, to be executed immediately by firing squad!"\n\nThe crowd roared its approval, and the boos came fast and heavy as soldiers hoisted the slaves to their feet, beginning to drag them down the hall and out of the courthouse. Suddenly, one wriggled free. He pushed past the guards and, in one loud yell, shouted something that silenced the room. It would not be published in the news reports the next day, nor would it stop the crackle of gunfire that occured in the next minutes, yet it stuck with those who heard it long after the other details of the trial faded from their memory. After all, there was only one thing that it could mean, and if the slave spoke the truth, then what would the next years bring?"

speerflavor.20.d:0 ""What are they doing?"\n\nJan held his binoculars tightly to his face. Next to him, Mykyta watched as well as he could, though the action was currently happening well down the street.\n\n "I have no idea." Jan replied. "There's a man in a suit- he's talking to the army right now- they're setting up speakers?" Jan looked over to Mykyta in near disbelief.\n\n "Are they negotiating? You can't be serious." Mykyta responded, a similar look in his eyes. The Germans, negotiating with slaves? Untermensch? It didn't happen. Besides, why would they? Mykyta and Jan would never say it aloud, but they knew that, if the Germans really wanted to, they could steamroll any resistance the slaves could put up. Why would they negotiate?\n\n "You must be seeing things. Give me the binoculars." Mykyta snatched the binoculars from Jan's hands, pressing them to his own face. True enough, he watched as the man in the suit argued with a flustered officer. After a few moments, the man in the suit grabbed a microphone and began to stride forward. A stately voice blasted from the speakers, engulfing the factory.\n\n "Good afternoon!" the voice boomed. "My name is Helmut Schmidt, minister of foreign affairs and lead diplomat of the Reich! I have come to discuss terms of surrender, so that none may die on this day. With your co-operation, we can come to terms. Without it, the end result of this affair will be more bloody than either you or I want it to be. If you wish to cooperate, send a sign." With that, the man retreated back to the police cordon.\n\nJan and Mykyta looked at each other again. A mix of disbelief, joy, and relief permeated through each of them. Perhaps they could succeed after all."
speerflavor.20.a:0 "Incredible!"

speerflavor.21.t:0 "The Treaty of Frankfurt"
speerflavor.21.d:0 ""I'm telling you, Herr Schmidt, we can't accept that. We want to be free. There is not a compromise between freedom and slavery."\n\nHelmut Schmidt leaned back in his chair, resting the bridge of his nose between his fingers. "And I must tell you that I'm working with limited time and space here. You don't know how hard I needed to work to even get this chance. To release you, after a violent uprising? No, it would never be allowed. I need you to work with me here."\n\n "Then perhaps I will remind you, Herr Schmidt, that we still hold numerous hostages."\n\nThere was silence for a moment, as both parties regarded each other. Though neither side could read the other's mind, both knew that they couldn't afford for the negotiations to fall through. For Schmidt, it could spell the end of his reputation. For the slaves, it could spell the end of their lives. There had to be a compromise somewhere.\n\n A bolt of inspiration struck Schmidt, and he took his chance. "Look. I can't release everyone, but perhaps I can hit a middle ground. My proposal- you and the rest of your leaders surrender, and we try you fairly. The rest of the slaves are freed, along with the hostages. If you take the deal, I promise- none of you will ever see a slave factory from the inside again."\n\nThe slaves looked at each other. Schmidt attempted to hide his distress- were they sharing looks of joy? Agreement? Distaste? He needed a result soon- no doubt that Speer was getting antsy at how long it was taking to strike a deal.\n\nThe two men on the other side of the table looked back to Schmidt. "Herr Schmidt, if what you say is true, we would be happy to accept imprisonment if our comrades go free. I'm sure the other leaders would feel the same."\n\nThe prisoners couldn't see it, but the tension of the last days evaporated from Schmidt's body as he rose to shake their hands."

speerflavor.22.t:0 "The Briefing"
speerflavor.22.d:0 " Schmidt and the Gang entered the room all smiles, Schmidt himself carrying a healthy number of papers. Speidel passively watched as Schmidt carefully set them in front of Speer, who began to look through them. Midway through the first one, he stopped, looking back up to Schmidt. "Herr Schmidt, I'd prefer to not be looking through these all day. Is it possible for you to give a summary?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "Of course, my Führer. I flew to Frankfurt and engaged in a dialogue with the slave leaders. Over the course of the next days, we spoke to one another at the negotiating table, concluding in an agreement where, in exchange for the freedom of the hostages and the surrender of all arms, the leaders, and the factory, we would let the slaves go free-"\n\n "Hold on." Speer interrupted. "You let all the slaves go free? As in, all of them?"\n\nSchmidt paused for a moment. "Yes, my Führer. It was the only way to a successful deal."\n\nSpeer sighed. "Jesus Christ, the Heer is going to fucking shred me, Schmidt. Do you understand? The conservatives, the militarists, the buisnesses- they're going to fucking shred me."\n\n "My Führer, it was the only way." Schmidt replied, his tone of voice hardening slightly. He attempted to continue, but was again interrupted, this time by Speidel.\n\n "May I interrupt, my Führer?" Speidel questioned. He continued before he got an answer. "While the intentions of Herr Schmidt are certainly in the right place, I fear that we may see a wave of revolt among the slave populace when they learn of our softness on this issue. We need to stay on guard, perhaps raise security on major factories."\n\nNow Schmidt was the one interrupting. "For God's sake, Speidel, are you still going on about this? Your solution would have killed a hundred people, probably more. Sure, there could be some unrest. Does it truly matter if we've saved lives?"\n\n "I'm not saying it was the worst choice- there were certainly worse solutions proposed. All I'm saying is that we need to be on guard."\n\n Schmidt threw his hands up in the air. "My Führer, all of the details are in the folders. I'm sure you can find them for yourself." With that, Schmidt departed, with both the Gang and Speidel following shortly. All that remained in the room were Speer, his thoughts, and the mountain of papers on his desk."

speerflavor.23.d:0 "To our great Führer, Albert Speer\n\nMy Führer, we of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Club for Albert Speer in specific, and the United University Clubs for Albert Speer in general, cannot commend your actions regarding the slave rebellion in Frankfurt higher. Indeed, there was some concern that you would go back on your word regarding the freedom of all slaves when the news was first passed to us. When the news came through that not only had you sent Helmut Schmidt to negotiate with the slaves, but had succeeded in your goals, I can only describe the mood as ecstatic. Indeed, we can certify that in Germania, we held an impromptu rally in your favor that was attended by at least a thousand fellow students. Such rallies were also reported to us by our other chains across Germany. We are so thankful to have a leader who truly is backing up his promises, and we are certain that this chain of action will continue. Know that, no matter what forces try and stop you, we will always be behind your rule.\n\nSincerely, Rudolf Wagner, Head of the United University Clubs for Albert Speer.\n\nTo the Führer, Albert Speer\n\nOne cannot help but look at your recent choice to negotiate with slaves, the bottom tier of German society, with disdain and fear. We in the Heer worry greatly over this recent course of action- is it not true that we Aryans are superior to our slaves? If we treat our slaves like Aryans, then what will the meaning and the power of the word even become? Suffice it to say that many of us in the Heer are more than a little displeased with this recent change in actions. Such foolish measures as negotiating with slaves will only lead to trouble and western corruption in the future, and the notion that this western corruption may be infiltrating even the highest levels of our government is very worrisome for those who love our Reich and what we have built upon it. I can only implore you to change course immediately, before the nation which we all love falls to bolshevism and decadence.\n\nSincerely, Oberst Hans Meyer, Commander of the 2nd Regiment, 36th Division."

speerflavor.24.t:0 "Aftershocks"
speerflavor.24.d:0 ""I told you it would happen, my Führer, and it has. Read the reports for yourself." Speidel dropped a folder, filled with paper, directly onto Speer's desk. Speer took one look at it and, already knowing the contents, sighed deeply. Schmidt watched on, repressing his own anger at Speidel's continued resistance.\n\n "Hamburg- Two guards dead, six slaves dead, a dozen wounded. Danzig- Four guards dead, six slaves dead, another dozen wounded. Munich- 14 guards dead, 25 slaves dead, dozens wounded. The list goes on and on, my Führer." Speidel spoke with the certainty of a man who had memorized these reports. Speer placed his head in his hands as Speidel continued. "It seems clear to me, and many others, that this was a poor course of action to take, and now we are seeing the results."\n\nSchmidt cut in. "Herr Speidel, when will you stop going on about the damn decision? I think it was a net positive."\n\n "Of course you do, you came up with it." Speidel spat. He turned to face Schmidt, who seemed to grow angrier by the second.\n\n "And you say it isn't because we turned your proposal down!" Schmidt pointed at Speidel, who remained unmoved. "We avoided a disaster by negotiating- can you imagine the international response to us gunning down slaves? What about the students and reformists- you think they'd agree with running people over with tanks and cars?"\n\nNow it was Speidel's turn to get angry. "Herr Schmidt, it is your choice, not mine, that has led us into this mess! We would never see slave unrest to this scale if we had not enticed them to do so!"\n\n "ENOUGH!" shouted Speer, his head snapping back up. "What's done is done! There's no use arguing the damn point! If I hear one more argument about what we should or could have done, I'm throwing both of you out of my office!"\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Both Speidel and Schmidt were caught off guard by Speer's outburst, when he usually was the only one to remain calm in these scenarios. Finally, both men exited the office, leaving Speer alone to ponder what could have been, and what his actions would mean for Germany."

#Antonin flavor

speerflavor.25.t:0 "Fresh Blood"
speerflavor.25.d:0 "Antonin Grzywacz was not fit for this kind of work. Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, assembling car part after car part, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip and a pained yell that would always accompany it shortly afterwards. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle that would signify the beginning of their shift was absent. In its stead was a deafening gritty voice that came over the entire factory. In his time of servitude, Antonin had learned German and was practically fluent in it, which made understanding what was being said easy enough. It seemed to be an announcement of some kind, and as he listened in, the fingers grasping the assembly line tightened.\n\n"Workers of the Reich!" The voice exploded. "Listen carefully! On orders of the Führer, today we will begin introducing two things. The first will be an overhaul of the factory. It will chiefly concern an increase in safety protocols," he said, and Antonin cracked a discreet smile. Since when did they care? "While some of you will be receiving advanced training regarding new equipment being brought in. Next! You will be working with a few Germans--" ... What? The- "Who have been designated as being highly disciplined, efficient, and with a strong work ethic." As if the monstrous Aryan knew anything other than bloodshed, Antonin thought, a sudden fit of anger overtaking him. "It will be in your best interest to cooperate with them, else the punishments for acting out on your beastly instincts will be extreme!"\n\n"That is all. Continue working." As the crackle of the voice faded and the whistle signalled the beginning of the day, Antonin saw several men walk into the building. Unmarked. He scowled to himself, but he was no fool. The Germans settled themselves in, but the rest of the day passed with a silence that barely contained the intense murderous aura that surrounded many of the Polish slaves working there. Even Antonin. But he wouldn't succumb. Even in this scum-sucking bottom-of-the-barrel life, opportunity would come. For what, he didn't know, but he knew he couldn't work himself to death in here. Not yet."

speerflavor.26.t:0 "Fraternizing With the Enemy"
speerflavor.26.d:0 "That day, he felt particularly tired. Rubbing his eyes as he passed the checkpoint into the factory, Antonin floated a thought in his head about calling off from work. But, no - this wasn't Poland; they'd only accept a delimbing as an excuse, and even then. With a hiss laced together by a sigh, he noticed that a slight adjustment in workers was made. This happened every few months, of course, but this time luck proved unfavorable towards Antonin. Walking into the factory, he should've expected it sooner or later. But actually seeing the man - not particularly outstanding in any way, not even possessing the desired traits of an Aryan like blonde hair, was a thought running through his mind long enough for him to hear a shout behind him. It was the harsh voice of a factory overseer that grazed his back which called him back to him senses, and with an awkward neck rub, Antonin went to his designated position.\n\nHe was no fan of the Aryan, that much he could say for certain. His dislike of the man next to him plagued his mind. What an insult for a German citizen and a Polish slave to be working side-to-side like this! Antonin's mind drowned out the noise from the outside world as he thought, filling him with frustration about this awful fact. It was only when something akin to a voice came through did his haze stop up and lift. Then he heard it again, more clearly this time. "Hey, ah..." The other man began. Antonin tilted his head to the left slightly, enough to denote that he was hearing, but also continue to stare at his work. "You're Antonin, right? That's how your name was listed." No response. It took several seconds before the German continued. "I'm Gottfried. I've just been thinking... if I'm going to be working here for a while, I might as well-" That's when Antonin decided to turn all the way, giving him a cold glare. "No talking on the job." He said, almost spitting venom. "What sort of 'discipline' do you have to be doing this?"\n\n "I..." The other man began, seemingly wanting to say something. Then he turned back to the assembly line, muttering, "Nevermind, then." The German backing down from a conversation struck Antonin as strange. Why did he even bother to engage in conversation in the first place?! Did he not know who they were, and who he was? He didn't bother to think about it any further. By the time the whistle rattled through his head, all Antonin wanted to do was sleep. Sleep for as long and as heartily as he could."

speerflavor.27.t:0 "This Land is Your Land"
speerflavor.27.d:0 "He was 49 years old now, and things have changed significantly ever since that announcement two years ago. This transitionary period was marked with relative calm - the incidents where non-Germans would assault Germans was rare, and it only got rarer when rumors spread of what would happen to those that tempted fate towards their overlords. Having spent most of his waking days here, he knew it all inside-out. That's how he also saw, bit by bit, how his fellow Polish workers were being phased out. At the very least he knew this time around where they were going.\n\nGottfried wasn't one of those 'highly disciplined' Germans, he had come to learn, instead being a volunteer for the Reich's program of encouraging them to move into less populated, more diverse cities nearing the edge of the border, rather than staying inside overcrowded metropolises. If only he could visit one of them. But discussing these things with Gottfried served as the second best thing. "So, Antonin," the German began, barely paying attention to the assembly line as he worked. "Have you heard?", "No, Gottfried, I have not." Antonin responded, prompting the man to follow up with: "Führer Speer has decreed Polish slaves-" Antonin winced lightly before glaring at him, whose eyes widened in slight surprise as he nodded. "Ah, um, I'm sorry-- workers will be allowed to, uh, in due time, leave their assigned job and return to the city that they were born in. Or, if they were born in a village, in the city closest to that village."\n\nAntonin almost couldn't believe the words he was saying, causing him to fumble with the car part in his hands for a moment, threatening the gaze of a nearby overseer, before he readjusted and continued. "I'm sorry, Gottfried, but I don't believe your government is so kind to do that. There's always something in it for them." He said, bitterness pouring in near the end. "Well, I suppose that is... true... " The German said, very warily, very hesitantly. "But think about it. What does that mean for the future? Perhaps more liberties would be afforded to you at home?" The thought of such a thing made Antonin chuckle. "Sure, Gottfried. When they eventually kick me, a man nearing fifty, out of the factory, what will they make of me when I return to a city I don't belong in, as a man well past the point of usefulness?" He asked. Gottfried began to open his mouth, but relented. There was nothing more to speak about this topic for today."

speerflavor.28.t:0 "Embers of the Past"
speerflavor.28.d:0 "Antonin's fiftieth birthday was today. These days were no different from any other. Only a reminder that his body would continue to break down and become less useful, and that his mind would dull with the passage of time. For that morning he brought a slightly worn-out coat to work, and passing by the checkpoint, noticed an aura distinctly different to how it usually felt. When he entered the factory, Antonin noticed that all the workers were congregated into a half-circle around a podium in the middle of the room. Fitting into the crowd of half Germans and half Poles, Antonin stared at the collection of what looked like military officers, one standing in front the rest. Subconsciously gritting his teeth at the sight of a proper Nazi, Antonin listened in as the man gave a stiff salute. And then...\n\n"Workers of the Reich! In this case, I am more importantly addressing our Polish slaves." Antonin rolled his eyes. Of course. "The Führer has announced that the Litzmannstadt automobile factory, property of Daimler-Benz, is letting go of all Polish workers who have not been born in Litzmannstadt!" Immediately, the murmuring in the crowd was heavy, but a slamming of rifles against the ground by nearby soldiers shut them - and Anton - up quickly. "Effective today, those in question will be given three days' worth of rations, their documents, including a passport, and one month's work of pay. You will be guided to trains that will head either to German territory, or to the Polish government." Feeling a need to say no more, he gave another stiff salute. "Dismissed!"\n\nAntonin's mind had entered a flurry. Was what Gottfried said that year ago really going to ring true? Was he going to go home? Why now, of all times, and so suddenly?! There was a tightness in his chest as he approached the man he had now known for two years, and for a moment, he had looked at Gottfried as if he was just another German, but it passed just as quickly as it appeared. "Y-you were right..." Antonin began, and his fellow worker nodded silently. "Now I must board a train and head to a city, all in one day. This all has happened so quickly, so suddenly, and..." He trailed off. Gottfried shook his head. "I don't know much, Antonin, but I know that I'll miss talking to you." Antonin looked at the German carefully, swallowing a lump in his throat."

speerflavor.29.d:0 "The wooden flooring made his behind sore, but it's not like he could complain. The train car's door in front of him was open, exposing the endless green that swirled past him. He didn't know what to think. What was there to think? Nothing at all. Indeed, that was what Antonin was going through. He thought of nothing, but his mind hurt as if he had a migraine. Perhaps he was not allowing his mind to think? Yet deep in that hole of nothingness and despair, a thought was extracted. He could notice his breathing becoming more hitched, the scratching of his fingertips against the floor as his hand tightened up.\n\n"I have been here before," the sentence wandered in his mind. Numb and cold, but it held an ingrained sense of impossibly comprehensive fury. "I have been here before," it repeated, begging to be completed. "The rumbling of this engine and the mixing of the colours in front of me. I recognize this all. It's familiar to me, in a way I cannot ever forget." And how could he? If he did, he would lose the last thing that made him a person. Otherwise, he would simply be a shell, hollow and tumbling in the void, waiting to be consumed by reality's cruel whims. "I have been here before. When I was, I never expected to be anywhere else. But I did. Now I have returned."\n\nAntonin was not thinking. How could he think? If he did, it would only open up long-lost memories that he would not dare to look at. Here, in this train, he was alone. Utterly alone. In this car there was nobody else but him-- he had all reason to think, and all the time. But he would prefer to have his mind remain closed. Banishing the flame that threatened to engulf him in his mind, he only stared mindlessly into the fields, all of which blended into the same field, green and endless.\n\nYet even in a lack of thought he hated the chugging of the engine - the bumps in the rail making him stop up his breath as if the ride had ended. Silence dominated his surroundings, but all he could hear was noise that was almost thirty years overdue. He did not feel the pain in his fingertips, nor the fact that everything in his vision blended into shapeless blobs and whirlwinds of color, and the grinding in his mind that lasted for hours, and hours, and hours..."

A symbol of oppression removed - but it meant nothing to him. In fact, it only served to further frustrate him. Every day after he would come home from work, into a small apartment that can barely house one person, Antonin wonders what really would happen now.  Clearly, this was not the end goal that the Germans had intended for him, as Gottfried had implied. But what then? What else was in store for him and his people?.\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle woke him from a daydream and alerted him to work. He was dreaming so often nowadays - was that age, or simply a want to escape reality? Either way, work was monotonous as before, only with somewhat less oversight from the guards, who seemed willing to pounce on any opportunity to harass them. If life had to carry on like this, perhaps it wouldn't be so awful. He had a place to live, and a steady supply of people to talk to, as well as walking around a city freely... even if it was tamed by the Aryan, and moulded in its image.\n\nAt least, those illusions of which lasted until a fellow worker spoke to him. Surprised to hear a voice, he observed who spoke to him - it was a woman, who seemed to be in her 40s. "You," she began, with Antonin listening in only passively. "I can tell that something is off with you. Like a pacified animal, you shamble about and wait to be put down. Is that right?" That caught his attention immediately, and he hissed out: "Are you ridiculous? What are you saying?", "What I am saying is this: I can sense that you are empty, my friend. That you have wanted something which has been kept from you for a long time.", "And what would that be?" He silently struck back, frustration already appearing on his face. "An opportunity," she said, and a small smile graced her lips.\n\n"An... opportunity?" Antonin repeated, the word echoing in his head. Was that not what he was looking for? In all his years of labor, he never once struck a German in fear that he would miss out on an opportunity. And now... ? "To take back what we've deserved for so long. You know as well as I do, don't you?" She asked, as if she was speaking of some long lost artifact. "Say it. That alien word that has been stolen from us for decades."

speerflavor.31.t:0 "A Thirty Year Fury"
speerflavor.31.d:0 "Grigory had always carried the hate passed down from his father. There was a spirit in him-- unconquered, unbroken, unwilling to bend to the will of the Aryan scum. But he had nothing to show for it, only working day-by-day to toil himself and serve as a slave to the Germans. If that's all he would be, and remain to be, then it was almost better to simply cease to exist. The thought to grab the nearest metal object and rush a guard crossed his mind, but never in the years he was working there did he carry out that glorious fantasy. Perhaps he was a coward for doing so, and would always remain a coward.\n\nUntil one day, a shrill voice stood tall over him and the rest of the non-Germans present in the factory. He didn't understand much of their language, choosing to almost actively work against learning it, but he had still learnt fragments of it. Enough to learn and piece together one crucial fact: that the first German worker would come work here, beginning that shift.\n\nEven though the silence afterwards spoke for itself, the guards didn't motion for any increased vigilance. Instead, they seemed to show relief that their fellow brethren would work here. Grigory, however, had other ideas. Only minutes afterwards did the first workers began trickling in, and once they did, the light in his eyes had shone in a way previously unknown. He could tell what the sinking yet exciting feeling in his gut was. This was the time, and he could get no other time.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that the guards were lax from the German workers, perhaps the other Russians and Poles and Ukrainians decided to ignore the fact that Grigory seemed to tense up as if he'd seen the murder, and perhaps the German that was approaching him mistook his feelings as fear rather than fury. What was for certain, however, was the chaos that ensued when Grigory grabbed the nearest metal object, screamed in a voice coarse and unused, rage overfilling every inch of his body as he swung harder than he'd ever swung before.\n\nThe sickening crack that echoed through the factory was quickly drowned out by shouts and bootsteps, with the German falling to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut as Grigory unrelentingly continued. It took no less than six men to tear the murderous machine away from the man bleeding profusely on the floor, and only minutes later did silence come over the factory once again.\n\nWhen tomorrow arrived, there was one less slave working in the factory."

The silent corridors and empty offices were an almost eerie sight, long shadows cast by the moonlight and pitch-black corners, but a single light dispelled the ominous atmosphere: Helmut Schmidt was still in his office, working on the latest diplomatic documents, when he realized he had long since past the closing hour. He was very tired, and perhaps just a bit tipsy from the liquor he drank to keep himself awake. With a yawn, he turned off the light and looked from the window at the sleeping Germania: how different it was from Hamburg, so big, so strange!\n\nStill thinking about his home, he made to leave the office, but perhaps by chance, he looked at the mirror near the room's entrance, and wished he had never done it. His figure was dark, but a single moonray illuminated the very thing that he didn't want to see: the red band with the swastika, symbol of all members of the NSDAP, including him. Disgust crept from his feet at that cursed thing and at himself for wearing it every. Single. Day. He immediately went to remove it, as if it burned, but stopped when he heard a voice.\n\n"Why are you trying to remove it?" his own reflection told him, sneering in the dark mirror, "You can't lie to yourself, you like it, admit it!"\nAfter a moment of complete befuddlement, he replied, anger flowing from his voice: "I don't! I'm doing it for everyone! To build a better tomorrow! I'm- oh, no... no, no, no!"\n"Liar" the shadows replied as they took shape behind him, a severe visage so similar to him.\n"Fa-father?"\n"Look at what you have done, Helmut" Gustav Ludwig Schmidt said, disappointment heavy in his aged features, "You live among them, smile at them, shake their hands! You betrayed us! You are no son of mine!"\n"I- I'm doing it for-"\n"Liar!" screamed his father, "Liar!" laughed his reflection, "Liar! Liar! Liar!" cried a thousand shadows swirling around him.\n\nWith a loud crash, the mirror went into pieces when Schmidt threw his briefcase at it, and suddenly the spell broke. Trembling, crying, the diplomat looked around himself in fear, but only silence met his gaze. He fell to his knees, hugging himself, repeating the same phrase as if it could shield him from everything."

Those Slavic scum across the border of Militärbezirk Russland were unifying, preparing themselves for an invasion of Germany and the destruction of the Aryan race. Until that time came, the Feldmarschall would have to contend with grimy Russian partisans in the cities and the wilderness.\n\nThat was why he was there, after all. Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner and his brave allies were conveniently carted off to this snowy shithole by the blessing of the magnanimous Führer, where they would serve the Reich by protecting the Eastern Front from whatever insane faction managed to unite Russia. Schörner plucked the cigarette out of his mouth and spat onto the snow. He didn't know whether to be furious or flattered at being granted such an exile.\n\nThe nest of vipers that was Germania could never have prepared him for the disgusting Militärbezirk, where the German and Slav practically skipped through Moskowien hand-in-hand. What was the point in hunting down terrorists, training troops and securing the eastern border if such degeneracy was allowed in the cities? The Feldmarschall shook his head and took another puff. It was only a matter of time before miscegenation was legalized in this territory. Militärbezirk Russland deserved new leadership. Someone with the strength and courage of Schörner, with the loyalty and obedience of Remer, and with the determination displayed by their militarist clique. As for the leadership of the Reich...\n\n Schörner smirked bitterly to himself and threw his cigarette into the snow, where it hissed back at him. He stomped on it with his jackboot and set off towards his men."

speerflavor.34.d:0 "He was hardly expecting this day to come. Since when did the Reich take this direction... ? Under the new Führer, Abel figured. Fighting outwards from the Rhine and towards Germania during the tumultuous civil war taught him a thing or two of how things could so quickly change, and how the New Order can be just as volatile and prone to collapse as any other country. Though... those things did not concern him tonight, as he waited until the clock would turn to a new day, and then he would begin the preparations.\n\nA hundred men was, perhaps, overkill, but it guaranteed the approach he was going for; a swarm of trained soldiers surrounding the facility would let them know that it was pointless to put up a fight. It was... funny, really, he thought - these same methods he despised were now the methods he was actively using to make sure no blood could be spilled, though unlike his superiors, he made sure to consider the fact that the slaves also deserved this protection. With a sigh, he brought up the megaphone near his mouth as he nearly arrived to his destination. It'd been an hour since the operation began, so he was sure everything was in place. Thinking otherwise would make him needlessly worried.\n\nIn front of the large building dominated by lights and action, an armored vehicle bearing the flag of the Reich came driving casually towards the checkpoint. Seeing something like this happen at such a late hour roused suspicion, though the guards made no moves as the vehicle stopped up in front of the facility, and a man stepped out, dressed in the colours of the Heer and bearing a megaphone in one hand. With a click of the device, it came to life, and Abel took a deep breath.\n\n"This is Hauptmann Richard Abel of the Heer speaking. To all personnel guarding this factory, and to all the slaves working in it, this is a declaration of the Reich." The guards seemed confused. "As of tonight, this facility, belonging to IG Farben, has been seized by direct orders of the Führer, and will be transferred over to ownership of the government. Any attempt to fire upon the soldiers we have stationed nearby will be seen as an attack upon government troops, and will be treated with extreme contempt. The security personnel present and off-duty will be relieved of their work here, and are to be escorted out of the building effective immediately." He gave a short pause to see how they would react, and upon seeing the guards freeze up and understand the message, Abel continued. "That is all." The light crackling static of the megaphone abruptly ended when he shut it off. His job here was done."

Before, he couldn't bring himself to do it, but now, after having gone through the same song and dance three times in a row with Abs' mercenaries, he was to confront his actions, and the actions of who he was serving. He'd been in that cold, cold place for so long now that the dawn of a new day began to trickle in, sunlight piercing windows and beaming on barely-worked assembly lines and hollow slaves. He should have left an hour ago, he thought.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nThere was no armband, he could tell. Well, one that didn't bear the six-pointed star. They were all gone now, and Hauptmann Richard Abel's stomach sunk. The deeds of twenty years ago finally caught up to Europe, and where was he during that long, long time ago? When the world was on fire and he was a match waiting to be lit and thrown in, he got his opportunity to strike the flame when he, and only he, encountered something that would make or break a soldier under the banner of Aryan superiority. Abel could still remember it, clear as stars in a pitch black sky, his focus on the real world fading as his mind began to wander.\n\nIt was a family of three, a woman and her two children, though he could hardly remember what any of them looked like. They lived under the house of a Ukrainian man, right on the Donbass river. He didn't speak Ukrainian and nor did the man speak German, but something about his desperation when Abel hit the butt of his rifle against the wooden floor caught him off-guard. The begging and pleading that still stuck in his mind made him relent. There, in that house, were no comrades of his back then to just shoot the degenerate Slav. Instead, he was given a choice. Would he do his duty to the Reich? Then he would be congratulated as a Jew-hunter. And what if he left them be? Then he would surely hang as a traitor to the Aryan people. It felt like an eternity before something happened - but eventually, Abel knew the path that he would take.\n\nNow he stood here, surrounded by cigarette smoke, a veteran fighter of Germany, serving for almost twenty years. Things have changed oh-so-much. He wouldn't call his country reborn, no, but the winds of change blew another direction. Yet..."

Before he was out of the apartment, however, Erich heard him say, "And please, live a little."\n\nIt was another dull day at work. Nothing but the management of files, sorting it by the alphabet, and the long hours spent by a typewriter. From the windows near his cubicle, Erich caught a distant glimpse at the figure of Germania. Its paved roads, its Roman-style boulevards, and its almost grotesque dedication to maintaining a faint link towards a fake, imaginary past. The memories of the slave camp haunted him, not just in mind, but in his body.\n\nHalting the clacking motion of his hands, he stared at his fingers. Slender and thin, bony and almost dry, like teeth gnawing on the typewriter's buttons. He was still fragile. On a whim, he crossed his fingers together and cracked them. The words came back to him.\n\n"Please, live a little." Wessel said. No doubt, he had seen the state of Erich's apartment. Dusty, messy, dirty, and dingy.

He spun it in his hand, letting its long and slender body insert itself to the various gaps between his fingers. His eyes stared off into the distance, and he paid no attention to the briefing. Erich was the single agent there. The room was plain and dull, but that was understandable. Rows and rows of white, artless, and stark metal desks and chairs - with only one attendant present. A whiteboard with a map of Monowitz was before him.\n\n"Hey, Herr Fischer," the briefing instructor said, annoyed by Fischer's antics, "are you paying any attention?" He was the same as the receptionist in his hotel. Greying, boring bureaucrats in an endless waiting line for something to do. The Reich's Aryan hierarchy seemed to be an environment where men like these could live, thrive even. As opposed to the blond, eternally youthful, and blue-eyed models seen in countless propaganda posters - Erich had seen his share of those. He would tell you that none of it was accurate.\n\n"I've been there," Erich said, "done that. Why don't we make a deal, Herr Instructor." He leaned forward on one hand, putting his pencil down. "You tell me what to do, straight to the point. That way, we can get our jobs done without much more contact with one another."\n\nThat seemed to get some rise out of the man. "Deal, but one condition," he held his index finger up as if to emphasize the point he was making, "I don't hold any responsibilit-"\n\n"I got into the job knowing the risks, sir. I would not be a field agent otherwise."\n\nIgnoring Erich, the man proceeded, "You are to infiltrate the Monowitz slave camps and gather intelligence, as before. With one twist," the man pointed on the map, with pointless irony, "once you're in there, you will be contacted by an RND element within the camps. He will give you the equipment to proceed to your second task. Sabotage the camps and provide suitable conditions for the RND to trigger a slave revolt there."\n\n"Sounds easy enough."\n\n"I appreciate your sarcastic wit.

 speerflavor.39.desc:0 "Once again, Erich found himself riding the train that would carry him to the depths of hell. He had never seen a carriage packed so full to the brim before. Well - he had. Once upon a time, a few months ago. The scent of sweat had formed a layer of briny smell, sickly sweet, and saltily bitter. Erich had once passed an eternity in here, but thankfully, he had a place to sit this time. Others were not so lucky. Some collapsed under the heat of a hundred bodies pressed together like sardines. Erich knew that some had died.\n\nInside the cramped, damp, and dark atmosphere of the carriage, he drew a picture of Monowitz from memory. There were the pens, the guard barracks, and finally the chemical plant. An eternity would pass, but he held onto the picture like a man clinging to driftwood amid a shipwreck. Soon. Soon.\n\nThe carriage halted, its tires screeching as it entered its port. Its doors slid open with full force, and early morning light poured into the gloom. Those who had survived the journey filed out, carrying whatever their fate had spared them to have. Erich's possessions were not much. Papers and some clothes - just enough to get a skilled laborer permit into the more humane portions of the camp. Not that that was much to speak of.\n\nThe camp's guards assembled them into two groups: one for men, one for women. Then they lined them up, and an officer sorted both ends into skilled and manual labor. Ahead, in Erich's queue, a man dressed in the most opulent uniform possible in this place flicked his fingers. Left. Left. Left. Right. Erich had heard the stories of where the left side had led to. He shuddered. He hoped his papers were enough.\n\nWhen Erich's turn came, the man's fingers flicked. Right. Erich had never breathed a greater sigh of relief. Next were the showers: a comparatively more relaxing place to go to.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Erich's old life had vanished, and only darkness awaited ahead."

 speerflavor.40.t:0 "On the Path to Liberty"
 speerflavor.40.desc:0 "The guards of Monowitz treated skilled slaves with a little more respect than manual ones. For example, Erich did not have to huddle and sleep in pens containing hundreds - thousands even - of slaves. He had a cell of his own. He was supposed to bunk up with nine or more slaves, but his companions never arrived. It was either fate or the RND's intervention. It could be both, really.\n\nFor the first weeks, Erich worked under the alias of one Herr Hermann Dach, a supposed specialist on the operations of the chemical tools they used here. Of course, Erich knew jack about the details of his work. Then again, he would never have been a field agent if not for his expertise in the arts of mimicry.\n\nIG Farben did not go easy on its slaves. Returning to his cell, he threw his body onto the thin slice of mattress they call beds and slept. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he found, served on a platter, an enormous piece of bread. Erich's mouth watered, but its purpose was probably as both a meal and a signal to commence the operation. He tore into it, piece by piece, not wasting anything, not even the crumbs.\n\nAt last, he found a key and a map. Stopping his surfeit of ravenous appetite, he put the rusty iron key to the platter and unfolded the map. It was small, barely the size of Erich's two hands put next to each other. It was enough. Drawing Monowitz's floorplan from memory, he correlated the X on the map with a secluded corner of the yard. He turned the browning, barely consistent piece of paper over to see if he had some more information to work on.\n\n"You have 45 minutes."\n\n ~P\n\nErich made for the prison cell door as quickly as he could."

The X mark glowed like a single speck of starlight in the map of Monowitz within his mind. When he reached it, he dug with his hands. The dirt seemed surprisingly loose, crumbling readily to his grasp.\n\nIn a minute, he found a black backpack buried under all those refuse. The RND had not abandoned him. He was relieved. The last time they sent him deep undercover, they did not give him anything. Erich had to perform on-site procurement for practically everything that he had needed. He was in no hurry to extend his stay at Hermann Abs' personal slave labor camp. Unzipping the bag expectantly, he peered to see what treasures lay within.\n\nErich found a tidily folded uniform, closely matching those worn by the demons of this man-made hell. A pistol with a silencer accompanied a belt stacked with a few clips. A bolt cutter was in there as well. In a few seconds, the bag had transformed him from the fortunate but ill Hermann Dach to the most dangerous agent of the RND. A handwritten note at the bottom of the bag said:\n\n"240 minutes."\n\nIt would have to do. Donning the uniform, gun, and equipment, Erich Fischer set out, the best agent the RND has ever had.

Erich had to be quick about it: in a camp as large as Monowitz, there was bound to be a lot of slave pens. Sabotaging one might be easy, but dozens of them would prove to be quite the task.\n\nRows upon rows of identical, brown barracks stretched out in front him. Erich had reached his quarry. Before him were shabby figures shambling in the shadows, laden by exhaustion and fatigue. Their silhouettes made pity rise in Erich's heart. After all, he had been here before. His ribs poked out from his uniform - an eternal reminder of what he had undergone in the name of the Reich. \n\nUnpacking his equipment near one of these brown buildings, he set to work. Taking out his bolt cutter, he set out to do his task. Erich looked at his watch. With a little luck and elbow grease, as the Americans say, he'd be all right."

Perhaps whoever behind the notes had once been an intelligence officer themselves. Their work certainly showed prowess and a penchant for executing dangerous gambits with verve and panache.\n\nHis lungs craved the puff of a cigarette. It had been too long. A week? A month, perhaps? Erich's mind had lost any semblance of time that had gone within the camp. From dawn till dusk was work, work, work. These places were not used for labor alone, but also for extermination. \n\nHe did not believe in the racial theories spat out by the Reich's bureaucrats and politicians. If they had spoken the truth, there would be no need for institutions such as these. There was no nobility in slavery. If the Fuhrer had not been paying Erich's paycheck, he, too, can fuck off.\n\nThe time had come for a decision. The briefing had outlined the goals that Erich needed to pursue in his time working within the camp. He could follow that directive, but he could make a run for it - and no one would blame him. With the guards gone, slipping away did not seem hard. Erich looked at his watch. Time was ticking away. It was now or never."

Whoever solitary guard he encountered dressed well, their evil permeating through the clean fabric and cloth they wore. Erich felt out that this place did not belong here: a spot of order and sanitation within the bowels of the most inhumane organ of the Reich.\n\nWhile he stood there, awestruck by the first signs of civilization after months (or was it weeks?) of captivity, a greeting came, from somewhere ahead. "Good evening," someone said, an innocuous phrase that shot tendrils of surprise and shock through Erich's spine. At least he did not look out of place, and his disguise worked. Returning the greeting, he strode out of view as quickly as he could. Erich was not there to test his luck. His next ordeal would require every ounce of subterfuge that he possessed in his bones, and he was not about to waste it to the indiscretion of these people.\n\nThe ammo storage was his objective. P's help with the patrols would not avail him here. He was alone, and the uniform was the thin line that separated him from discovery and danger. His clammy skin clung to it desperately, holding on for dear life. The time had come to test the value of the RND's investment into its equipment."

Here, there was no languor, no lapse in attention on the part of the guards. There was no lack of firearms on the site. The solitary guards that Erich encountered before had handguns, but here, they sported rifles and submachineguns. Above, a sniper perched on a tower beaming with a spotlight, ready to pick off anyone that came near. Erich may have a handgun, some clips, and a steady hand, but frontal assault can only lead to a single end. Death.\n\nStaying out of sources of light, he reconnoitered the ammunition storage. Perhaps more information would help. The guards here would be more discerning than the ones he had passed by on his way here. It would be awkward with the two guards at the front if he saw through his disguise. There was no telling if they would let him go or shoot at him. Erich would need to trust in the RND's preparations to pass undetected. He did not want to trust them, owing to the incident a few months ago, but he would have to, to make it out of there alive.\n\nA third path was open to him, however. He could, instead of following the RND's directives, leave. No one would blame him for his sense of self-preservation; he had completed one of his objectives anyway. So his choices towered over him, as the spotlight came close to highlighting his position. To advance, or withdraw?"

His uniform did not pass muster, and he hoped to the Lord that his gun's firing mechanism would not jam on him. The ammo cache shrunk, as the feasibility of reaching it grew smaller and smaller.\n\nHis first instinct was the make a run for it. A stupid notion. The rifle and submachine gun can nail him at this distance without much effort. He had only one way, one path to survival. Like in the American Westerns he loved so much, his hands must be nimble and his fingers ready on the trigger. He drew his gun and fired.\n\nThe first shot caught the rifle guard on his eye, sending him spasming to the ground, lifeless. The second round found the submachine gunner's heart, halting him on his tracks, as he slowly collapsed to the ground, drowning in a pool of his own blood. Before Erich could revel at the work of his reflexes and skill, however, a gunshot rang out from the tower. A bullet whizzed past his head, kicking up dust and dirt behind him.\n\nFiring whatever ammunition he had left in his pistol at the sniper, Erich broke into a run.

If he falsified his reports, no one would know. He would walk free, a man who had attempted his best to accomplish his mission for the Reich and its Fuhrer. He would be a hero.\n\nHe walked towards the entrance of the camp, through the gates where the head guard selected which slave was a skilled worker and which wasn't. If Erich strode out of there, he would never face selection again. Avoiding any source of lights, he dodged patrols and slaves walking and hobbling in the shade. It was miles from here to an RND headquarters, but the walk was worth it. He had done his work. It was time for him to find a life that existed beyond the dangers of his job. Maybe he'll start a family, and finally settle down.\n\nHe smirked, and then laughed, voicelessly, silently. He was free.

Whenever he wanted to, he could bite into it, and let the poison work its way into his system.\n\nHe decided that it'd be too easy. Erich gritted his teeth. His fingers traced the contents of the pouch slung on his hip, feeling for boxy magazines that contained bullets for his submachine gun. There was one and only one. His laughter mixed with the oncoming shouts of alarm and the blaring of sirens. Somewhere, someone screams, and eddies of sobbing made his way to this barracks, Erich's bubble of quietness. For the first five minutes, it was tranquil, almost peaceful. Erich did not believe in God; his Catholicism was mostly for show. Yet, he felt an urge to pray, to repent, at the very last second. He shrugged it off.\n\nAs if on a rote habit, Erich unlatched the empty magazine from his MP5K, and loaded a fresh, new one. His hands cocked the firing mechanism, priming the gun. He trained his sights on the door and waited."

A few weeks ago, he had traversed his way inside, not knowing whether or not he would emerge on the other side alive and well. Yet, he did. The weeks passed by in his mind: befriending his fellow skilled slave laborers, and whiling away the hours spent in pain and exhaustion with nothing but a spirit that refused to die here. Erich's memories seized him, and he stopped in his tracks, trying to push it all away.\n\nMonowitz was something personal. Erich had not wanted to go there, not at all. However, he was sure that the RND would not protect him from his enemies or even try to assassinate him. Erich was sure of it. He had accomplished whatever he was sent here to do: to facilitate a slave uprising in the Monowitz camp as best as he could.\n\nYet, he stared at the looming, bulbous chemical plant that threatened to swallow the whole eastern side of the camp. What he had done - sabotaging the locks, and rigging the arms cache to blow - was in the name of necessity. This one was personal. If only he could make it in, Erich's one remaining explosive would ensure that whatever volatile chemicals inside it would burn the plant down.\n\nHe only needed to decide whether or not to do so. It was risky, but perhaps it was worth a try."

 speerflavor.82.desc:0 "It was a success. The guards let him in the chemical plant with no problem, and all that's left for Erich to do was to "inspect" the equipment. Once he was left alone, he planted the bomb and set the time - something he was running out of. Any minute now, the charges Erich had placed within the arms cache would explode, and that would be an awkward position. He walked outside with alacrity and panic bounding within his gait. Any minute now, any minute now.\n\nHe said farewell to the guards that kept watch over that place, saying that the equipment was kept to satisfactory standards. One of them chuckled and said that he would beat the slaves senseless if they hadn't. He turned his back on them, and his walk turned into a trot, before accelerating into a gallop at the quickest pace to the nearest forest. It was a very close-run thing, and Erich did not turn even after the camp exploded and burnt behind him\n\nReaching the edges of the woods, Erich looked back and saw the fires rising high to the night sky, almost like a second sun. He withdrew a cigarette from his coat pockets and smoked it. A job well done."

His vision became blurry, and he had to steady himself from collapsing before he got here. Blood trailed his footsteps, dripping like eaves after a summer storm. Erich slipped and fell face-first into the linoleum floor, the lights in the ceiling closer to his eyes than if he had stood. He dragged himself by the steeples of his fingers, his arms fighting on where his legs had failed.\n\nErich was going to die here. There was no question as to his survival. He was sure that one of his organs had malfunctioned, and his pain-addled mind was struggling against an inevitable shutdown. Propping himself up on the side of a desk, he felt his bag for traces of the bomb. Taking it out, he examined the square package. No bullet had managed to destroy it, and he marveled at the miracle. He pulled the safeties out, and set the timer to the quickest. He won't be able to run. Erich smiled, through his blood-stained teeth, but he will wait. \n\nWhen the charges set the factory alight, Erich's body had crumpled to the ground, lifeless."

 #IG Farben HQ infiltration
 speerflavor.48.t:0 "Briefing"
 speerflavor.48.desc:0 "Erich set his pencil down and looked around him. Rows upon rows of stark, artless, and utilitarian white metal chairs and desks - yet there was only one attendant. The room was as plain as its contents. A single, rectangular lamp at the center, and a blackboard with the map of the IG Farben's Headquarters before him. He felt a compulsion to review his notes, something new to him. Rifling through the yellow-tinged, neatly-lined pages of his notebook, he read it with a kind of indolent alacrity.\n\n"Any questions," the briefing instructor said, "Herr Fischer?" The man giving him the lay-down was the very picture of Aryan vitality. That is to say, the types that the Reich's racial hierarchy helped survived and flourish. Bureaucrats with nothing to do but to endlessly recount past data and extrapolate into the future, all to no avail. Like lines washed away by the waves. If Erich were to be honest, he hated them.\n\nOn this occasion, however, he found their fastidious, annoying attention to detail useful.  Even idiots with no sense of initiative and foresight could find work in the RND. "Say," he said to the instructor, keeping the tone as level and cool as his head, "can you summarize, briefly, what I am to do here? We both know we need to get back to work quickly, so the sooner the better, sir."\n\n"In brief, what you are sent there to do is to intelligence gathering," the instructor said, pointing pointlessly at the map, "but the risk is incredibly high. If IG Farben were to discover you, the RND has never had you as its employee."\n\n"What kind of intelligence?"\n\n"Account books, implications of customer abuse, violations of the labor laws, that sort of thing."\n\n"Sounds like a dull assignment."\n\n"Oh," the man seemed struck with Erich's cockiness, "I assure you, nothing about this assignment is dull. Now, Herr Wessel has granted you a lot of leeways to choose your moment. When will it be?""

 speerflavor.49.t:0 "Convening the Council"
 speerflavor.49.desc:0 "The headquarters of IG Farben was a truly massive building, and Erich had a vague idea of how much Hermann Josef Abs wanted to drive the point home that he was a powerful businessman. It was barely illuminated under the pale moonlight, but the front of the building was fixed with a bright light, showing three guards, all armed with fully-automatic rifles, patrolling and standing guard. It was not as heavy security as Erich expected it to be, but then again, it was merely the entrance. The inside, he was certain, would be far less forgiving.\n\nHe was already fond of nature before, but he was even more fond of it when it allowed him to sneak from the side and crouch towards the front, thanking his training that allowed him to move quietly across the grass. When he got near the entrance, Erich sunk back into the shadows as a guard passed him by, and prayed to whatever deity was watching as he moved out towards were momentarily unoccupied as all three guards were to busy patrolling the street in front to pay attention to the man rapidly walking up the stairs and towards the set of glass doors.\n\nAlready his brow furrowed with sweat as the doors swung open and closed behind him with a silent, but still painful creak. Then his eyes flicked upwards and spotted the outline of a camera on the other side of the room, beginning to turn to where he was. With quick reactions, Erich leaped to the nearest pillar and dragged himself down it before sitting on his behind, letting out a sigh of relief. Already, he risked failure. But then again, he had no room to complain."
 speerflavor.49.a:0 "He was one of the RND's best, after all."

 speerflavor.50.t:0 "An Unreliable Lackey"
 speerflavor.50.desc:0 "There was not only one camera there, but two. Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, Erich managed to slip past both of them as he went up the stairs and climbed to the second floor of the building. The first, he knew, would not provide anything to him. The second, however, had the possibility of giving incriminating evidence. At least, that's what he was told. Opening a door, Erich listened in before moving into an empty office cubicle, getting down under the desk as his ears perked up. He wasn't alone in this place. There were more guards here. Two more, judging by the footsteps of one farther ahead and the talking of one closer to him. He let a minute pass before he moved out.\n\nErich knew that he wouldn't find anything in these cubicles, so he had to search for an office. When he crossed the short hallway separating one set of cubicles from another, he felt his chest tighten as one of the guards rounded the corner to the hallway he had left moments before. Had Erich been a second slower, he would've been caught. Circling around the large room, he spotted a few more rooms to the side, but one caught his interest.\n\nWaiting until the footsteps turned stiff and then turned silent off in the distance, Erich pushed open the glass door and read the nameplate that was on the desk.\n\n'RHINELAND REGIONAL OVERSEER'."
 speerflavor.50.a:0 "Bingo."

 speerflavor.51.desc:0 "The good news was that he had all the time in the world to discover what was inside the office. The bad news was that he had to look through the office, while also not drawing attention to himself. Erich knew the overseer's office had a camera in the corner, and every time it passed by him, he was tempted to bite his lip. The RND promised him that some cameras in the building would've been sabotaged - rolling the same footage throughout the night, as an example, which would give him infinite breathing room. They had even been so kind as to mark out which cameras were sabotaged, and which were not. All Erich hoped for was the Reich was wise enough to not underfund the agency's equipment. Oh, how he hoped.\n\nThe things he discovered during his tenur in the overseer's office was... quite interesting, to say the least. For everything related to the Rhineland, practically the industrial metropolis of the Reich, the numbers purported in several of the documents that Erich looked over... did not align with what IG Farben reported. In essence, what were lucrative trade deals and massive investments coupled with generous loans and promises of high quality products were all much less than expected. Such ideas would dig heavily into IG Farben's budget, but promising them would mean an injection of funds from the government, and an increase in business dealings.\n\nNot bad, Erich thought. They were effectively ripping off millions, and these papers could potentially mean at least a partial incrimination of IG Farben's staff. The question, however, remained.\n\nWas this enough?"

Even though he put his life on the line, at least the result would be dismantling an empire built on slavery. It wasn't Hitler's empire, but... the flicker of good came in steps at a time.\n\nThe moment Erich stepped out of the office, however, he heard something that nearly shot his heart from his chest. A loud, piercing noise that went from ear to ear, and then a shout. The RND failed to do what they were meant to do.\n\n"ALARM!"\n\nErich had to act fast. Any moment of hesitation and he would've been dead. Drawing his silenced pistol, he rushed towards the exit of the room and narrowly avoided one of the guards passing him by. They didn't hear his own footsteps while the alarm blared, it seemed. When Erich looked down the half-spiral staircase down to the lobby, however, he spotted bad news.\n\nTwo guards from the outside made their ways in, and both split paths up either set of stairs. Quickly, Erich huddled himself into the corner, pressing his body against himself as tightly as he could, and waited for the booted footsteps of a man with killing intent to pass by him and into the room he had just left.\n\nBrimming with sweat, he practically flew out of the exit, spotting a guard on the outside that was approaching the building. With a quiet shot that rang out in the night, the man yelled and fell over, bleeding from a leg as Erich made a mad dash into the trees that surrounded the building."

Erich had to move up further, and things wouldn't get easier from there. When he sneaked out of the overseer's office, he made his way to the nearest stairway, and spotted a guard standing like a stone statue near it. He was stuck from moving forward, and he had to act quickly, because the guard on the other side would be making his rounds to here, too - then he would be pincered.\n\nTravelling to a nearby cubicle, Erich spotted a book that hung off of the edge of the desk. It was a thick book, and Erich took a deep breath as he pressed down and heard it slam to the floor with a loud thud. Quicker than the footsteps he heard approaching, Erich returned and hid under the nearby desk, covered in darkness as he saw a pair of legs move past him.\n\nWith a deep breath, he moved his way out and practically rushed to the stairway, silently climbing up the steps and into the third floor. Here there were four guards, he could tell, and once again it was his job to find what he needed on this floor. Then, as he made his way to the right, he spotted it. A crown jewel."

 speerflavor.54.desc:0 "Erich Fischer did not consider himself a lucky man. But this made him crack a grin. Now he was getting closer to the heart of IG Farben. Much, much closer. Wasting no time, he hurried his way over to the office before any of the guards had a say in his actions, and made sure to neatly close the door behind him as he saw yet another camera flick back and forth. He put a lot of trust into the RND. Perhaps too much. With a sigh, he began to flip between pages, records, drawers, and the many other things in this office.\n\nEntire minutes passed. He was slowed down heavily by the constant footsteps outside, as he refused to risk entry by means of them hearing the noise inside. Eventually, however, Erich found out a strong curiosity that overshadowed what he had found a floor lower. Records that spoke about Abs' transactions; he was a rich man, perhaps the richest man on the globe, and Erich had a feeling that not all of his wealth was legitimate. Where Abs was supposed to pay the government hefty sums in taxes, he had found loopholes and falsified statements about his income, effectively slashing the money he had to pay to niceties.\n\nErich greedily took the documents with him, adding them to the collection of what he had already gathered previous. With these, he could make for a strong case against IG Farben, and for all intents and purposes, he had done more than enough. He had all the reason in the world to leave, but one piece of information still eluded him. The personal office of Hermann Josef Abs. Would he take the risk, bringing him into almost certain death, or would he remain content with what he had taken, and to return to the RND as capable and clever? As Erich opened the door, he made his decision."

He was wide awake, and his senses on the ready. As he passed cubicle by cubicle, the sound of footsteps drew closer and closer, and Erich knew that more time spent waiting was more time for gaps of error to show. He had to act decisively, and he took a risk by looking out towards the hallway nearby to see if anyone was walking down, and there was. Moving back, he was thankful the guards were tired, as it seemed like that guard didn't notice him poking his head out. When he passed, Erich moved.\n\nThere was another door that he slipped by, and then a set of stairs. Dim, blue light and colorless concrete stairs were his only ally as he made his way up, passing by the fifth floor and then the sixth. Before he reached the seventh, however, there was a sudden conundrum. He heard more footsteps - this time coming from above him. Erich's mind was thrown into a panic for a moment, but he readjusted himself. He was expecting another person, but the guard was not. And so he got up the steps, standing right at the edge, when the guard rounded the corner. Right into Erich's grasp.\n\nWith a lunge, he wrapped his arms around the guard's neck and threw him to the guard, keeping him restrained with what the agency taught him, and using every muscle in his body that the RND forced him to develop. It wasn't difficult to overpower the man, and, after almost ten seconds, he felt him lose consciousness. Dragging his body to a corner, Erich continued moving upwards, knowing he was on a time limit that would kill him if it ran out. When he finally looked through the door into the large expanse, he saw it, and something more."

As Erich stepped out, however, he was greeted by something he well and truly dreaded in the back of his mind. The shrill noise of an alarm blared throughout the floor, and voices reverberated from the cubicles and hallways to him. "ALARM!" Was what Erich heard, and he felt a hint of betrayal. The damn RND said that the camera in the accountant's office was sabotaged, and he knew he hadn't been spotted by any of the guards. The ticking timer now turned into a bomb fuse, and Erich had only one way out.\n\nSlamming open the door with his elbow, he quickly made his way down the staircase, but encountered unpleasant resistance along the way. Fortunately, Erich shot first, and the guard only managed to fire one off-balanced shot that pained his ears as he fell on the ground. That would've attracted everyone else, he thought, and it did nothing to ease his worries.\n\nErich began to continue moving down the staircase - he would go to the first floor and pass through the doors in the lobby to the outside, he thought. Then he heard the door of the second floor creak behind him as he was halfway down, and Erich knew he only had moments to respond.

Maximum security was to be employed, and maximum response, too. Instead, he listened in and observed. From here, he could see Abs' office clearly, and the inside was lavish. Paintings hung from the wall he could see, and while he was no art collector, Erich had a feeling they were quite valuable. Elsewhere, Hermann Josef Abs himself was present, talking kindly to two other figures. The first was Friedrich Flick, and the other was Edmund Geileberg.\n\nWith a puff of his cigar, Abs grinned. "Not to worry, dear friends. Speer and his pitiful Gang may think of us enemies, but we have influence abound. So long as we remain cooperative, things will go our way. As they had under the previous Führer." Geilenberg took in his words and spoke nothing, while Flick merely raised an eyebrow. "So certain of that?" He asked, and Abs shrugged. "I wouldn't trust these resources that we have pooled as of right now. I have some... connections that I can pull. Most importantly, extremely efficient and highly drilled troops that could do a variety of tasks. Defending, attacking..."\n\n"You mean to tell me you've hired a mercenary company?" Abs cut in, blowing smoke as he kept his smile. Flick looked puzzled for a second. "Well, they're not exactly a mercenary company-" Abs merely patted him on his shoulder, speaking with a cigar between his teeth. "We won't need any of those 'mercenaries' of yours, Herr Flick. We have our own, but thank you for the offer."\n\nIt was time for Erich to choose. In just a few seconds, he had to formulate a plan of action. To get in, get out, and get the hell out of the building. They were blocking the way, so he had to find some measure to dispose of them. And not only that, but the many guards patrolling the area would make it almost impossible to sneak in. Let alone the cameras. Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

Even after the war's end, there's no rest: the reconstruction is proving more difficult than predicted, and the party bureaucracy is already starting to resist the changes suggested by the Gang of Four. Like the proverbial clay pot, Speer feels powerless to act, a small raft engulfed by the stormy sea. Taken by the sudden need to escape, he stands from his chair and goes to the window: perhaps it will do him some good to gaze at the great Germania he himself designed?\n\nLooking outside, a wave of memories surges from Speer's mind, snippets of a life that was a mere decade ago, and yet feels as if it was another geological era: showing Hitler the progress made as the two friends laugh heartily, visiting construction sites, directing the workforce, and finally the Volkshalle's inauguration, the crowning moment of his life as an architect. It was a different age, one where the future looked glorious, not this... maddening quagmire.\n\nThe more he looks at what he built, however, the more a feeling of dread creeps over him: why is that building over there still unfinished? Why is that apartment block so bare, the slots for the decorations are all empty! More than anything, who is that incompetent who used low-quality stone for the walkways?! They are already full of cracks! As he finds more and more critiques, he also feels something else, a need he had not felt in years: he wants to correct those mistakes, to make them right, but even more, he wants something... new. His hands itch with the need to design, to give tangible form to the things in his mind! How wonderful it would feel to be once more, even if just for a moment, Speer the architect!

He has awaited this moment for the entire day, and as he looks at the large, empty sheet, he feels like a painter staring at a blank canvas, ready to fill it with his art: all kinds of ideas swim through his mind, from tall, bold skyscrapers to simple houses and small villas. With a trembling hand, he takes up ruler and pencil, and draws the first line.\n\nThe first sheet goes straight to the dustbin, followed by the second and the third. Trembling lines and small blunders irk the perfectionist inside Speer, but more than five years of inaction require some time to catch up. The fourth sheet, however, survives the initial scrutiny: in the end, he has settled on a public office, a classic of his old practise. As the jumbling mess of lines seemingly drawn randomly acquires purpose, and forms itself into the skeleton of a building, a smile creeps itself on Speer's lips: he is finally free from the stress, from the obligations, from the quagmire, doing what he loves!\n\nAfter a while, the architect stretches his arms and looks at his work. The essential frame, the easiest part, is done, now it's time to start the real work! He looks at his watch, and jumps: it's already past midnight! Best going to sleep, or tomorrow work will be a pain... As he goes home, however, he can't help but wonder: will his newest design ever become reality, or will it remain a small closet dream, one to be put in a museum after his death?"

 speerflavor.67.t:0 "An Artist's Dilemma"
 speerflavor.67.desc:0 "The architect looks with satisfaction at his work. The foundations and the main frame of the building he has been painstakingly designing are done and ready to be built: from the quality of the concrete to the exact amount of steel bars needed to sustain the edifice, everything is specified with pinpoint precision in several side notes written in regular wandwriting. Now, all it remains is the façade, and this is where the true challenge begins.\n\nWith a sigh, Speer realizes that he never bothered resuming his theoretical studies after he became entangled in the Rechtspolitik - trying to survive in a world where most of your "colleagues" want to kill you is, after all, quite the demanding task - and now he curses himself for not having updated his knowledge. How is he supposed to finish his new masterwork? What will be the final stroke on the canvas?\n\nLooking outside for inspiration, he sees once more his greatest success... with all its flaws and mistakes. Would it be best to follow in his own footsteps, and use the style that forged Germania into what it is now? To act as if nothing changed in the last ten years? For a moment, he thinks of the new, grand structures built in the United States, with their new lines and glass walls: is the future the way forward? To fully let go of the past and find a new beginning?\n\nWith a last look to the Volkshalle, a final thought enters his mind: what if a third way is indeed possible? A fusion of old and new, of past knowledge and future design, a melting pot where both ideals would have to make a small sacrifice for the sake of art... As the Führer-Architekt takes pencil and ruler once more, he has made his decision."

 speerflavor.68.t:0 "The Old Lion Still Roars!"
 speerflavor.68.desc:0 "Yes! All his art has always been for the glory of the Vaterland, and his new design will follow the same rules! With passion, he starts designing the grand façade: it will be a tall, large entrance way with stone walls and columns reminiscing of the Roman temples he so highly admired in his youth, with a staircase leading to the door. Who needs steel and glass, the strength and raw solidity of stone are enough to impress the viewer, just as it did ever since mankind learnt how to sculpt it into the shapes it desired!\n\nOf course, a public building required to always remind those who entered it of its function. The central pediment will sport a single, giant swastika overlooking the entrance, and atop the pediment a tall eagle will spread its wings over the German people, just as the Vaterland spread across the globe in the wake of its victories. Eagle's heads would regularly jut out of the walls, holding banners or other symbols of national socialism, praising the strength of the German nation and its many virtues.\n\nWith the finishing touches done, the architect looks at his masterpiece with satisfaction. He hasn't yet lost his touch after all! Finally standing and stretching his arms, he takes a last look to the great Germania, and finally, he sees it for what it is, his greatest success, perfect as it is! There is no conflict between architect and Führer, for both shall bring the Reich to new heights of power and prominence, as it was before, and as it ever shall be!"

 speerflavor.69.t:0 "Out With the Old, In With the New"
 speerflavor.69.desc:0 "Looking one final time at the city he had designed from top to bottom, Speer finally realizes one thing. His ideals, his beliefs, his convictions are still there, they aren't gone, but he can see with his eyes how the first attempt at their implementation has gone: just like Germania, the Reich is a rotting corpse, and it will take a shock therapy to bring it back to life. One day, Germany will be once more at the forefront - no, it will be at the top - but only after sweeping changes have been accomplished. How can a small architect like himself change the tide with a pencil and a ruler?\n\nSlowly, his design starts to reflect his state of mind: the façade is clean, sharply cut, large glass window framed by black steel architraves, everything in stark contrast to the stone walls and colonnades of his own Reichskanzlei. As his building takes a shape so different from everything he has ever done, he feels a slight insecurity, like a child leaving his mother's embrace to swim on his own for the first time: he's leaving behind his old work, to create something he never thought to create, in a shape he never thought to give, so different from his initial plans; and yet, he knows this is what needs to be done.\n\nAs another evening turns into night, the architect finishes his work. With a last look to his old creations outside the window, and to his newest addition on his desk, Speer understands with painful clarity that he can no longer return to his old art: so much has changed in so little time, so much to learn, so much that he has forgotten. In his sadness, however, there's the seedling to a new relief: he's not done yet, there's one last thing he needs to do before putting his tools to rest.\n\nThe Reich will be born anew, a shining beacon of modernity! Perhaps it won't be the same Germany he had dreamt about in his youth, perhaps such a dream was never supposed to turn into reality, but he'll fight for his nation nonetheless, as he has always done."
 speerflavor.69.a:0 "The future is now, I guess..."

 speerflavor.70.t:0 "Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis!"
 speerflavor.70.desc:0 "As Speer reflects upon his choice, suddenly the truth dawns upon him. Didn't the Romans take the arch from the Etruscans? The columns from the Greeks? Didn't they study the Egyptians and their stylized forms? Yes. Did this make them any less Romans? No! On the contrary, they grew with everything they learnt, every new notion, concept, technique they absorbed! They didn't accept passively the foreign influences, but neither did they remain closed in their own little world: they assimilated all following their own criteria, everything put into the perfect place for it to shine brightest!\n\nThe solution, the breakthrough Speer needed is there! The architect resumes his work, his mind a melting pot. Slim, graceful stone columns hiding the steel inside them, just like his new Germany. Beautiful and proud, a steel gauntlet inside a velvet glove. The glass would take new forms, curved and elegant, fitting into the façade's fronton and reflecting the light into a majestic eagle holding the laurel of victory. A rainbow of colors, mitigated by the pure white of the stone, would marvel the visitors without scaring them, a comforting feeling of brightness and warmth.\n\nAs the first rays of morning relieve his tired eyes, the architect-turned-Führer can't help feeling satisfied. This time, perhaps the first in his entire life, he has created something entirely new: a new style, a new fashion! Perhaps it will never take foot, but it doesn't matter: an artist works for himself first and foremost, and he finally understands that he is, indeed, still an artist. Now, a new work awaits him, his masterwork, the coronation of his craft: to rebuild the Reich! To rebuild it into what it was always meant to be, a nation fully capable of embracing future without forgetting the past! As the cleaning staff opens the door and jumps seeing the Führer still inside, Speer greets them with a wide grin: this is a great day for Germany, the first of many to come! A new dawn, a wonderful dawn!"

 speerflavor.71.desc:0 "Benno Ohnesorg was dead. That news was already bad enough. What made it ten times worse was the news Speer got immediately following the murder, and he felt both disgust and anger rise in him when he found out.\n\nThe student movement grew a spine and the slaves grew consciousness. They had cast their die and crossed their Rubicon. Now they were not merely protesting, but also clashing with the police. In the streets of Germany, cameras rolled by state-controlled and underground journalists showing the mass panic that rippled through the cities, and the brutality exchanged between police and the rioters-turned-revolutionaries, stoked the growing fear across the nation. It was not received well by the public at large, but Speer received it worse. The slaves - and everyone else associated with them - needed to know their place.\n\nHe did not consult the Gang to make his decision. He had no need to - the next time he held his speech in the cold, dim Volkshalle, he made it clear. The streets would be filled with officers armed with guns. Live ammunition or otherwise. Silence dominated with the occasional approval from those who listened to him, and he met the Gang with cold silence - especially Schmidt, the brazen rat he had no patience dealing with. He knew what he'd say, and he didn't want to hear it.\n\nFor as many concessions as he gave to the pitiful reformist elements that backed him up for so long, he knew he could not disappoint his mentor by giving in to their every demand. It would only bring ruin to Speer's vision. After all, this was the Führer's crisis to solve."

Clearly, the military police he had sent in did nothing to alleviate the anger the rioters felt. The rambunctious fools. The idealistic, short-sighted, animalistic fools. All they knew was chaos and panic, and here they were, burning down one of his most prized constructions. There were so, so many memories in that place. Glory echoed its field, but now it was empty; and did anything good come of it?\n\nPerhaps one thing. Speer's realization that these fools could not be dealt with in peace. He had given them a chance to take the olive branch, and they merely spit on his hand. Now he was in his office - and here stood a member of the Gang. "Minister of War, Henning von Tresckow." Speer coldly called, and Tresckow stood tall, unflinching, gazing at the Führer with an emotionless stare. "The Minister of the Interior is busy, so I'll pass this responsibility onto you. This revolt has gone too far. These madmen must learn what martial law is like."\n\nTresckow shifted uncomfortably. "Herr Speer, I-" Not a second more did he continue when Speer cut in, quickly and harshly. "That was an order, Henning von Tresckow, and you WILL listen to it. The time for playing games with your liberal demands is over. Germany burns, and I will destroy this alliance before I let this horde burn the rest down like the barbarians pillaged Rome. So I advise you to listen." He couldn't see it, but Tresckow's hands behind his back were clutching against each other tightly, and his finely-cut nails scraped against his skin in anxiety. "Alright, then." He said, giving a short nod. "Is there anything else you want me to do?"\n\nWas Speer looking at him or through him? He couldn't tell. "No, Herr Tresckow. I want you to focus all of your attention on this. They will learn the values of violence and discipline. The whip will crack, and..." Speer's fists trembled. "They will learn. As a Prussian, I'm certain you agree." Tresckow's face said anything but. "Now go. You are dismissed.""

He didn't have to read them, of course, he knew exactly what direction this revolt would go. They would push and push, and the Wehrmacht would push back, until finally, the Aryan heel would stomp down and annihilate the petty resistance the revolt gave to submitting to the New Order. The thought soothed his mind a little, but he was still bitter with anger, and a certain someone kept trying to push him down another road.\n\n"My Führer-" Schmidt began, and Speer took no chances, slamming a fist against the desk and glaring at him with rageful, tired eyes.\n\n"This nonsense AGAIN?!" He said, stirring himself into anger. "Helmut Schmidt, know your place. I've spent the past two decades trying to move past web after web, and now you're constantly biting at my ankles, here and there. Who do you think I am, Schmidt? Some sort of peace-loving liberal scum? Perhaps you are, but I am far from such a thing."\n\nSchmidt ground his teeth together, feeling his breathing become heavier. "I've advised you, time and time again, that clashing with the slaves would ruin our international image!"\n\n"To hell with our international image! You..." Speer's eyes narrowed towards Schmidt. "You... lying in bed with the Reichsbanner, aren't you?" Schmidt felt his stomach churn, and he stepped away. "I should have seen this earlier. I should've realized a decade ago. You are more than just some pathetic liberal. I know who you are now, Schmidt - you are a rat! A RAT!" Speer kicked back his chair and stood up, almost frothing at the mouth. "Get out of my office! Get out, you Judeo-Bolshevik bastard! Get out before I have you hanged as an enemy of the state!" Schmidt felt sweat drip down his back as he began walking out, while Speer didn't relent."

 speerflavor.74.desc:0 "One bullet in the chamber and none in the magazine. That's all that he needed. All that he wanted. Speer calmly slid the gun under the desk and swallowed back pent-up saliva. Then the tremors returned, and Speer raised his head to look up at the maps on his desk. Here was Germany, powerful and strong, a population of more than a hundred million, built on success after success, and with his guiding hand would steer it into the future. In the east, it was all stripes and circles. The slaves. The whelps. The untermenschen. They had taken so much territory now, and again and again his Aryan people failed him. He would not allow it. No, no, no, no, no. The Führer was no longer Adolf Hitler - it was Albert Speer. He held the power now. He called the shots. All he had to do was make the call. Make the call... make the call...\n\nMake the call.\n\nPapers and office equipment clattered to the floor, and Speer slammed open a drawer, pulling a pen out. The map of Europe remained, and he began scribbling it. Just like when he was back with Hitler, when strategies would be described. He punctured holes into the map to signify where the tanks would blitz. He scribbled across whole areas that would be carpet bombed. Oh, they would learn their place. By gun, bullet, fire, tank. He didn't care what the rest of the world thought. Germany was the master of the world, and everyone else would bend the knee. "And him..." He muttered, voice grazing against his throat with hoarse pain. His eyes flicked to Germany.\n\nSpeer let out a short, raw chuckle. "Helmut Schmidt. You, you Jew. You Zionist little puppet. How I'll see you hang.. m-maybe I'll..." He reached in a hand and barely wrapped his fingers around the grip as he pulled the pistol out, and it clattered weakly on the table. "Yes... yes, that's what I'll do. I don't need to sign papers. I'll just do it myself!" He laughed harder this time, and he furiously drew on the map, a line here, a circle there.

Ever since Speer fantasized about returning to his roots as the dictator of Germany, he was scared. What if it went wrong? What if he was stopped? So he anxiously waited for something - and that something came.\n\nWhen Albert Speer received the news that Willy Brandt was now in support of the slave revolt, his mind went into a white haze of rage. Without thinking, he tore the classified document in half, and reached for his gun. He knew where Helmut Schmidt was, and within minutes he knew the Jew would be dead. If only Speer had the patience to give him something worse.\n\nStorming out of his office, he began walking directly to Schmidt's office with only one thing on his mind, but something stopped him. In the dim shadows of the Reichskanzlei he could hear footsteps behind him. Before he could turn around, pain shot through his arms as hands grabbed on tightly, and in front of him walked Reinhard Gehlen. "What the hell are you doing, Gehlen?!" He screamed. "No... you know, you know! What do you know?!"\n\nGehlen gave a small smile as he recovered a thick document and a lighter in each hand. "My Führer." There was no weight to that word. "I have an...interest in keeping things as is. Here," he said, wiggling the document mockingly in his hand, "is a list of all the terrible things you did during your tenure as Minister of Armaments and War Production. Here," he continued, flicking the lighter open near the paper, "is your freedom. Choose wisely, Herr Speer. One will end you. The other will free you."\n\nSpeer could barely see anything past unfocused shapes, but he could hear crisply what the man said. His strength failed him as he attempted to break free. "He set you up, didn't you?" He asked, and Gehlen raised an eyebrow. "Schmidt - he did it, he brought you here, he knew what'd happen, didn't he? Didn't he?!" Fury filled his cracking voice, and all he could think about was how Schmidt would look with a bullet in his brain. "Schmidt!" His lungs pained him. "Schmidt!"

Sometimes that woman who talked to him in the factory visited here and there, and they talked. They would talk about current things happening, and she was like a source of information. He learned things outside of his simple life - how the world was in turmoil, how Germany was making this sweeping change and passing this outstanding law.\n\nHow they were still treacherous bastards, and how things would never remain the same, and how day-by-day, things only grew tenser.\n\nAntonin knew it would happen. In fact, he was waiting for it. When he received a pair of knocks on his door, he closed the book in his hands that was about the great Slavic migration into eastern Europe, and unbolted the chain, letting it open slightly so that he could look outside. "Yes?" His old, unused voice asked, and he could see it.\n\nTwo men in uniforms-- and the sign of the Polish Home Army. "Greetings, Antonin Grzywacz. We're here on behalf of the Free Europe army." In his hands he held a rifle that harkened back to old times. "Will you fight, sir?" The man's face was hard, but sympathetic. "There will be no work for you tomorrow." Antonin knew that well. "But I can understand it if you wish to remain here."\n\nSlowly, Antonin unbolted the door complete, and let it open wide. He was old, perhaps even frail, but... Antonin shook his head. "No, son," he began, holding his hands out. The soldier nodded, and handed him the rifle. "I can still fight. Er..." He looked down, then back up. "Before we go, can I ask you a question?"

He was a young boy in Poland... oh, how lovely the fields were all up until the point where they weren't. He grew from a boy into a teenager and from a teenager into a man, and he had settled down with a beautiful girl he knew from across his home - and they had raised three children, one who was just a bit slow but it didn't matter to him nor to her and it never bothered the child's siblings. They had all been beautiful.\n\nHad been beautiful. Then, for the past twenty years, Antonin was a hollow man. The Nazis had taken everything from him, grinding his family into dust and ashes and only spitting him out, untainted yet broken. How he longed for death and for the relentless pain in his mind that followed him day after day. Then things had begun changing. Finally, perhaps, the German was showing mercy. Something else that wasn't sheer cruelty, monstrosity, bloodshed. He had met a man who sparked the flame known as friendship with him, and he was a German. What was his name... he couldn't remember.\n\nThen, one day, they had finally given him his freedom. And at home he met another woman. Her name was Anna, and she was fierce, perhaps a bit younger than him but he had been working up the courage to ask her to go on a date with him. Now he laughed about it, and then drew in a sharp breath. The bullet lodged in his stomach made his body numb and his sight fuzzy, and God how he had hoped that some Nazi would have walked in and put him out of his misery or that some tank rolled over him, or an artillery shell blowing his body into pieces.\n\nNo such thing. No such thing - and no help would ever come. He was abandoned by the frontline, and it had long since moved past him. Long into the night, when his consciousness began fading, Antonin cried. For as much as he wished for death, he was truly afraid of it. He didn't want to let go, even if the pain was overbearing, but reality caught up to him. By the time the sun rose, Antonin was dead."

Many thoughts coursed through his head, but as he glanced between him and Anna, he swallowed back the anxiety. The messenger, meanwhile, glowed with positivity. "Good news! Everyone, listen closely. Th-the Reichsbanner managed to haggle with the Germans - we get to go home!"\n\n"What?!" Shouted Antonin, and the messenger seemed ecstatic. "We get to go HOME!" Instantly, cheers from Antonin's squad erupted, and infected the partisans that were in the nearby buildings. His confused expression quickly shifted into a joyous grin, and he went to hug Anna, who gladly accepted it. "We get to go home, Anna," he muttered. "W-we can finally rest. Oh my God, I've been waiting so long for this..."\n\n"And I've still yet to see you fire your gun," Anna replied, giving a short, happy chuckle, and they hugged each-other tighter before letting go.

I'm... a widower, to put it bluntly, and I..." Anna's eyes widened. "I have no ring, but I'm sure I can buy one eventually.

 speerflavor.79.t:0 "Die Deutsche-Physik"
 speerflavor.79.desc:0 "As any good German should know, Mein Kampf teaches that the tendrils of Judaism are deeply rooted in the entire world: fearing open confrontation with the master Aryan race, the despicable lot tries to gain the upper hand through cunning and guile. Jewish personalities are embedded in all sectors of society: from banks to industry to science, the amount of people openly or covertly swearing their allegiance to the six-pointed star of David and Judas is staggering.\n\nAs such, it's only natural that the relatively new field of Physics would immediately be infected by such a plague. From Albert Einstein to Enrico Fermi, the false doctrine of Jüdische Physik has tried to subvert science from the inside, spreading false beliefs on how the very fabric of the world was structured. It was only a matter of time before the true Aryans would try to cleanse universities and scientific institutes from this filth, and replace it with the true science, the Aryan science!\n\nFrom this cauldron of national pride and racial superiority was Deutsche-Physik born, a titanic effort aimed at replacing the decadent and corrupt Jüdische Physik with a doctrine that truly answered the great questions of our time. However, National Socialism wasn't alone in his quest for truth, and many had already tried, even on their own, to refute such false beliefs on the ground of Aryan rationality. From Hanns Hörbiger's Glazial-Kosmogonie in 1912, many other enlightened intellectuals, such as Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark understood the need to compile and organize a pure scientific community along the party-approved line of Gleichschaltung, a hierarchical coordination based on adherence to the official doctrine of national socialism."

While the overwhelming majority of all academic institutions believed such theory with the same fervour a policeman believes the excuses of someone caught pickpocketing, they were forced to keep their criticism for themselves as the Deutsche-Physik had been officially embraced by the NSDAP, and counted personalities such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler themselves among its staunchest supporters: to denounce its falsehood meant being branded as a "Juden-freunde" and subsequently purged. As such, an uneasy peace had been struck between the universities and the party leadership: the former would abstain from openly refuting the theory, while the latter would abstain from sending the most esteemed professors to the concentration camps as enemies of the state, especially since their minds were needed for the war effort more than their arms would be in any slave factory.\n\nAfter Himmler's exile and Hitler's death, and with the new Führer set on a more moderate approach to science and politics, the scientific community is once more in upheaval, and many feel that the day of reckoning has finally come. A scientific council has been convened in Germania, where the most prominent academics from the entire Reich will be present to discuss the future of science in this new era for Germany and the world. Even more importantly, the opening event will be a strong, official rebuttal of the entire doctrine of Deutsche-Physik, to be branded as a 'delirium inspired by racial hate and intellectual deficiency'. In its place, the council will ask for the scientific community to be regulated by merit and experience, rather than boot-licking and party allegiance."

Already letters are piling on the Führer's desk, asking him to officially support one side or the other, and the amount is getting close to the alarm threshold: should Speer refuse to take action, it will be interpreted as a sign of weakness, and he can't afford such a thing!\n\nForced to take action, the Führer stops to reflect. Preventing the council from happening is absolutely out of the question, as it will enrage the universities that were his first and largest support base during the Bürgerkrieg, and now are the fundamental pillar upon which to build a new Reich, filling the technological gap separating the country from the other world powers.\n\nAs it stands, there are only two possible choices: the first is to cave in to the conservatives without angering the scientists, which would mean completely ignoring the council and act as if it never happened, a safe choice in difficult times; the second is to openly support the reformists, and attending the council in person, thus sending a clear message to everyone about the new course the Reich is being set on.

At the given signal, everyone stands as the Führer arrives from the Halle's main entrance, the crowd parting for him like the Red Sea before Moses, until he takes his place: with the brightest mind of the Reich before him, and the Reichstag behind him, he addresses the entirety of the German people.\n\n"Citizens of Germania, today marks a new dawn! After long years of exile inflicted upon them by fools and charlatans, we welcome science, rationality and enlightenment back into our fold, never to let it go a second time!"\nA round of applause, then he resumes: "I wanted to be present to this historical day, to let our esteemed researchers and academics know that their plight has been noted by our government: their bright minds, unparalleled skill and selfless dedication to the cause of science shall pave the way for our country to resume its place among the great nations of Earth!"\n"Let science be one with national socialism as it was meant to be, free from the shackles imposed by envious men who believed they could decide whether innovation was pure or not! Long live science! Long live progress! Long live the Reich!""

As predicted, the doctrine of Deutsche-Physik has been officially refuted by the entire scientific community of the Reich, and the academic institutions will ban anyone who dares to claim its veracity. However, the council got almost no media coverage, and its results were publicated only by scientific journals and publications, with the result that, for all intents and purposes, the larger public never knew of its existence, which was exactly what the Führer wanted.\n\nIn the end, he managed to keep the party united by adopting the line of 'less resistance' and, while some reformists were disappointed by his move, and some conservatives were still angry over the fact that the gathering was allowed to happen, no one could truly complain much: the scientists had secured their grand congress, and the conservatives had ensured it would amount to nothing in the political sphere, a perfect result for everyone!"

speer_natsoc.1.t:0 "The Return of Autarky"
speer_natsoc.1.d:0 "Another folder was unceremoniously dumped onto Albert's desk. Another death warrant to sign, another treaty to withdraw from, another thing he was expected not to read and simply apply his rubber stamp. He decided to exercise a little rebellion for once, and put on his reading glasses.\n\nA quick skim revealed precisely why his party comrades would prefer he never see the document. "In the interests of national security", all ports would be closed to ships from outside the Reich indefinitely. It seemed the party disagreed with his rejection of Autarky, that dirty word they had begun using more as a propaganda piece than anything.\n\nHe looked at his desk. A cup of coffee - that would soon become much more expensive, if it could even be found in a legitimate market. His desk itself had been a gift from a Japanese dignitary, carved from a single piece of ebony grown in the jungles of Indonesia. No more fancy tropical woods. He looked about at the room he sat in, his office in the Volkshalle, his greatest creation. Every block of stone, every light fixture, every scrap of wire in the walls and piece of pipe in the floors had been mined here in his Reich.\n\nHe had no idea how many slaves were buried in its foundations."

The camera flashed again, and his grip tightened on the rail.\n\nNow the only goods that would pass through this port were those of the Reich.

Perhaps that's what they would call him. The get-by Führer. The camera flashed again, and his grip tightened on the rail.\n\nAnother one of Hitler's vainglorious dreams gone wrong, and he was stuck dealing with the aftermath as usual. The photographer moved closer, so close he could practically smell the bastard. A niggling feeling in the back of his head reminded him of all those days spent at the  Berghof enraptured by Hitler's ideas. He had done his best to temper the man , hadn't he? Or had he spent his time climbing the ranks?\n\nThe camera flashed and Speer's temper broke. With a wordless snarl he slapped it out of the man's hands to the cobbles below. There was some fuss to be dealt with by his staff, they'd probably buy him a new camera to shut him up. He ignored the commotion he had caused, and stared out to sea."

speer_natsoc.3.d:0 "The staffers filed in, most of them as useless as they were decorated. OKW meetings were more likely to kill any of them out of boredom than any enemy action was, and most of them were glad of it. They Speer could see more than a few buttons close to bursting on their immaculate shirts, festooned with medals. One would think that the Göring look would have gone out of fashion by now. He allowed himself a chuckle, and turned to relay his joke to Generalfeldmarshall von Stauffenberg to his right.\n\nThe old Prussian was sweating. Albert had never seen that before - the Volkshalle was famously freezing, a subject even he was not too proud to joke about. There was an odd look on his face. Speer ignored the gentle nudge from Oberlander, who sat to his left, and continued studying von Tresckow. Oberlander in turn ignored Speer as he was so wont to do these days, and called the meeting to order himself. There was a briefcase in the Generalfeldmarshall's lap. He kept toying with the handle as though he was afraid it would leap from his grasp. Henning's eyes, which previously had been vacantly staring at his feet, rose to meet his Führer's.\n\nOberlander continued his vacuous speech but Speer felt deaf. He stood, and the room followed his example in confusion. Henning too rose, holding the briefcase to his chest like his life depended on it. Protests arose until eventually all fell silent.\n\n"I have stood by for some time now." Henning began. "I had hoped things would change. I had hoped you would change. Now that everyone else is gone," His eyes remained locked on Albert's. "I see that I was a fool."\n\nOne of those staffers Speer had joked to himself about seemed to have an inkling of what was occurring. He slowly sidled towards von Tresckow,  staying behind him. Speer opened his mouth to say something - what, he would never know - but the staffer had struck at Henning, grabbing at the briefcase. The generals yelled and leapt behind the desk, but Albert was paralysed. The pair were tussling like animals, the staffer tearing at Henning's face-\n\nAnd then Generalfeldmarshall von Tresckow exploded."

speer_natsoc.4.t:0 "Ghosts Never Leave"
speer_natsoc.4.d:0 "When Albert awoke, he was assaulted by bright lights, burning pain and loud voices. He was later told he had been unconscious over a day, while they removed the fragments of wood and metal that had become the atmosphere in that brief second. The room he now rested in was empty and without windows. A pair of guards waited outside his door, and the rest of the hospital was presumably filled to bursting with them. The staffer who had saved his life had mercifully perished in the initial moments of the explosion. Several of his generals were not so lucky. He would have to give out some posthumous medals later, he supposed. He couldn't remember the name of the staffer - nobody had ever told him. \n\nGeneralfeldmarschall von Tresckow had been obliterated. Much of the debris flying through the room had in fact been him. Albert reached to his collarbone where a small wound lay. They had sent him through the X-Ray to identify anything they'd missed, and identified the tiny fragment of bone that lay underneath, too small to dig out without risking more damage. They were unable to identify to which man it had belonged. \n\nhere would be a purge, naturally. He had thought they had moved past those times, but heads would roll regardless of what he thought. From what he'd been told Tresckow had made few allies in his plan - the last gasp of a foolish traitor, they called it. Most likely they wouldn't let him attend an OKW meeting again, and no doubt Oberlander would snap up the opportunity to "represent" him. Another empty hour to fill his day. Another hour to think about what was. \n\nThere was nobody about who cared about his feelings anymore. He could order someone to listen, but all his guards, his assistants, his staff were more loyal to the party than to their Führer, and eventually every word he spoke would be transcribed and studied by those who claimed to obey him. \n\nThere didn't seem to be much for a Führer to do. So Speer cried."

speer_natsoc.5.d:0 ""And then, a meeting with the Gauleiters of Ostmark. Finally, there will be medals given to the Staatspolizei officers who dealt so well with that riot in Bremen." Reichsminister Oberländer set down the paper and looked up. The Führer was looking at him like something he had found on the underside of his shoe. "Riot? They had chained themselves to a gate." \n\n"You of all people should know how dangerous these students can be, Albert. The officers showed remarkable restraint - I'm told one of the rioters will recover," he insisted, pushing the pen and paper towards Speer. "Medals are only appropriate." \n\nSpeer snorted a humourless laugh. This time he did not even look at Oberländer - he seemed to be staring a thousand yards ahead, deeply unnerving the minister across the table. "No, I don't think they are. Tell them I'm tired. Tell them they're murderers. Tell them to fuck off, for all I care." He slumped back in his seat. \n\nOberländer took in Speer - a shell of a man. Great bags rested under his eyes, contrasting the pale skin that almost seemed to hang from his bones. His suit clearly hadn't been ironed, and he seemed to almost have shrunk into it. He had lost weight - always slim, he now seemed closer to a skeleton. He had hoped the man would be able to maintain a shred of dignity, but apparently he had to do everything around here. He gestured to the guards at the door.\n\n"You heard, the Führer is tired. Escort him to his chambers until he is well rested enough to perform his duties. The medal ceremony can be postponed until then." The guards moved to help Speer from his chair, but before they could reach him he flung up his hands and stood, giving Oberlander a withering look. Like the moment before a lightning strike, hairs on the back of necks stood throughout the room. The corner of their Führer's mouth twitched, but Oberländer did not shift his eyes, locked with Speer's. He could see there was nothing left within."
speer_natsoc.5.a:0 "It had better be a damn fast ceremony."

speer_natsoc.6.t:0 "Rubber-Stamp Führer"
speer_natsoc.6.d:0 "Albert wasn't there. He was handing medals out, certainly, but that was not where he was. This was an action that required no mental effort, no decision, and indeed he was not granted any decision. This was no different to stamping papers on his desk - pin medal on chest, thank you for your service to the Reich, shake hand, step left, repeat. The monotone voice was unnerving them, he could tell. He did not care. He didn't seem to care about much anymore. \n\nHe hadn't eaten in a day or two, he reflected. Perhaps that was why he felt so detached. His menu was the last thing they would allow him control over. Was he refusing to order from it out of spite? Guilt and masochism? He wasn't quite sure. \n\nThat worm Oberländer, treating him like a child having a tantrum. He could have had him shot on a whim, didn't he know? Could have. Everything was a could have or a was these days. He briefly entertained himself with the image of Oberländer lying in a ditch with a hole in his skull. He had seen enough men like that in the past few years. This time, he allowed himself a brief smile as he shook hands, vanishing just as quickly as it appeared. It seemed to worry the officer even more. \n\nHe stepped once again, extended his hand to pin a medal on another man who wasn't there before realising he had reached the end of the line. He turned about face without hesitation and began walking towards his waiting car.\n\nReichsminister Oberländer observed Speer from his own car. He turned to Otto, who seemed just as worried as he did about the Führer's state - though perhaps for different reasons. As Speer's guard Otto's concern was admirable, though his empathy was of little concern to Theodor. "Make sure he eats. Force feed him porridge if you have to, I don't give a damn."

speer_natsoc.7.t:0 "Inside the Third Reich"
speer_natsoc.7.d:0 "He was in the Führerbunker today. His ministers had evidently decided it was too dangerous for him to remain above, either for him or for them. The latest in a long line of peaceful protesters had apparently become tired of being beaten within an inch of their life, or an inch beyond. They demanded to know why their  Führer had lied to them. Why his government stripped away the freedoms of the same ambitious youths who had fought so hard for him. Why those same men they had fought against now occupied such privileged positions. To be honest Albert didn't blame his ministers for keeping him out of hearing range of these students - he wasn't quite sure what had happened either. \n\nA return to form, he supposed. Students had never been fond of him before, of anyone in the party save Hitler in his heyday. The benefit of being surrounded by men in black is your own shade of grey appears sparkling white. Students hate military men, propagandists, and politicians. So he had played the architect, the sensible one, the only sane man. It hadn't been hard. Yet now the men with guns were his, the posters all bore his face, and it was his speeches that the Reichstag clapped at for countless minutes; still, everyone was knee deep in shit. But perhaps he had remembered too late - when did he join, when was he first captivated by Hitler's magnetism? When he was a student. \n\nWhat had changed since he actually seemed to be in charge? He seemed to spend every day wondering how he had arrived in this situation, yet every day he went to bed none the wiser. For so long he had believed it was he that knew how things worked, not that vile arschlock Bormann, or that arrogant opportunistic bastard Göring. He had Hitler's ear, did that not mean something? Yet every year he realised more and more just how little that made him. \n\nHe couldn't hear any of the violence above being perpetrated in his name. So he pretended it wasn't happening."

speer_natsoc.8.d:0 "My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no-one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.\n\nI am inside my head again. I turn to the minister reading his notes, not that I can remember his name. He was saying something about death warrants. I'll probably have to sign them later. No doubt it would be someone I knew of someone, with too many good ideas making too much noise. I've attended meetings like this in Hitler's day, and I didn't care for them then. I don't care now, though not for the same reason. Back then I was too busy daydreaming of plans of buildings unbuilt. \n\nI know I am daydreaming now, but again for a different reason. People believed in me, but who am I? An architect? A warlord? A dictator? All these and more. I have made excuses every day, pretended to myself he did not see, I did not know, but I had known what was going on and had not cared. Rise higher, throw more people beneath your boots, then perhaps you can make a change.  Then my ego had taken over - why am I surrounded by killers, by liars, by men of such arrogance? Surely I can do better in these trying times than these lunatics? Now I am Hitler, and I seem to be the only one who knows. \n\nI recall the first time he had witnessed a speech from that paradoxical man. I had expected swastikas, brown shirts, roaring and demagoguery. He had been met by the opposite - a man in an inexpensive suit sharing his worries about his country he loved. He had mentioned the Jews of course, but only in passing, a menace of bankers rather than blood. Goebbels had been different, a frothing mess, a roaring croud, a repulsive spectacle. Yet still I joined. I was not choosing the NSDAP but becoming a follower of Hitler, I told myself. He had taken hold of me before I grasped what was happening, I believed for many years. Now I realise that being in a position to know and nevertheless shunning knowledge creates direct responsibility for the consequences."

speer_natsoc.9.d:0 "Unfortunately, Hermann Josef Abs still preferred to deal with Speer personally. Still, it was an opportunity to get out of the Volkshalle where the walls had eyes, and Abs had enough pull to ensure true privacy. Albert sipped his coffee, and picked at the selection of meats on the table before him. \n\n"This will be a much appreciated return to normalcy. Frankly, I had my doubts about that coterie of yours from the beginning, but naturally it was not my business." \n\nAlbert snorted. Everything was Abs' business. "Well, they seemed better than the alternative. I seem to recall you had plenty to say about them when they were infringing on your... business. Far be it from me to tell me how to run your operations, however." \n\nSpeer had remarkably become a more interesting conversationalist since his gang had up and fled. Abs supposed he needed a chance to vent, and he admitted he enjoyed their verbal sparring on some level. While Albert might no longer wield the influence he once did, he was an excellent messenger. "Far be it. Nonetheless, we are expanding our operations in Bayern this month. New factories, accommodation, you know the sort. There are a few documents required to expedite the process. Of course, if they ended up at the top of the pile, the benefits could be passed along." He raised his eyebrows pointedly. "

speer_natsoc.10.d:0 "Since Speer's ascension, the number of involuntary workers in the Reich had stagnated. Too much pushback to get rid of the institution, too much incompetence and corruption to keep it. Now that those subversive reformist elements had been eliminated, Speer's government could refocus itself on efficient slave management. \n\nIn Wartheland, Poles who did not officially exist are being dragged from their beds. In Ukraine, members of a once-proud Cossack host are surprised at their clandestine meeting by a squad of drunken Wehrmacht soldiers and beaten to unconsciousness before being sold for under-the table-cash. In Russia, sixth children of famine-starved villages are exchanged for an underfed pig or a crate of chickens. The first major slave expansion in twenty years is taking place."

They had clearly not grasped that the exchange of information was not a zero-sum game; a concept itself Speer had lifted from the works of a German enjoying the freedoms of America. A little trading is essential, be it resources or knowledge. Still, far be it from him to tell other people what to do. \n\nAlbert glumly signed the papers on his desk once more. He'd spoken with those few contacts in the intelligence community he still believed trustworthy - they too had done their best to express their doubts. Hardliners would be hardliners though. No information other than official state communications would be allowed to escape the Reich, and in turn no foreign communications could be permitted in. Sedition and treason were everywhere these days - or so he heard. \n\nHe turned his radio up - some American band he would likely never hear again. Receiving foreign radio was a crime now, don't you know. If he wanted a record he'd have to barter with one of the staff for it, like some Breton smuggler. Still, it was better than the alternative of only listening to proud Aryan music. God but he was fed up of Wagner."

The guard had been tripled, the building locked down and the courtyards prepared for the parade of six-wheeled Mercedes that never seemed to go out of fashion, despite taking more maintenance than a Tiger. Still, Albert reflected as he looked upon his new Reichsmarshall, perhaps he was just projecting onto the car the faults of its owner. \n\nSpeer had done his best to keep Schörner away from the high echelons of Germania, but the decision was now out of his hands. The Monster In Uniform had another feather in his cap, and his clique were following in earnest. The worst thing was the look in his eyes when he was shaking the bastard's hand. Pure, unfettered pride. Now they would all be forced to deal with his unique management style. \n\nAlbert examined the agenda. Expansion of Wehrmacht funding. Increased recruitment efforts. Military research and development budget tripled. Preferential contracts to IG Farben, Daimler-Benz, Reichswerke, the old guard. Unrepentant reaction to his recent reforms. He sighed, leaned back in his chair, and prepared for a long opening speech."

speer_natsoc.13.d:0 "Albert certainly appreciated the aesthetic of excess - that much could be gleaned from studying any of his buildings. Still, all things must have a function, and he was hard pressed to find the function of this place. The Reich had invested a great deal into nuclear power, but this plant produced practically none. Still the reactor thrummed away, atoms crashing and splitting with one end product - Plutonium. They had accumulated Uranium aplenty from their conquests in Russia and Africa, but that volatile and vital component in nuclear weapons was always needed now more than ever or so he was told. \n\nFissile material production had ramped up in response to the Reich's recent demand that their weapons stockpile be doubled in size, to appropriately operate as a deterrent. Speer did not see the difference - one city killing bomb will kill as many as a hundred if there are no more cities to be found. To his new ministers it seemed an economic stimulus, allowing for great expansion within those old, proud companies that dominated heavy industry and big science. To Schörner it was another opportunity to swing his weight and make room for himself. To him, it was a waste There would be no economic recovery if there were no people to recover it. And if Schörner got his way, there would be all the room in the world."

speer_natsoc.14.d:0 "It had been a long time since Albert had been to Austria. Bormann had rather spoiled the atmosphere in the Berghof with his tasteless redecorating, and Albert had been more focused on his own projects than renovating yet another of Hitler's houses. Still, the state visits never ended, and it wasn't like there was much outside the Reich to visit any more. This was admittedly one of the better views he'd seen on his travels, however. \n\nThe crunch of boots on snow was outlining the figures the officer offered him. How the hell they hauled this many tanks up here he'd never know. The normally stark white slopes of the alps seemed carpeted in Feldgrau, tents beyond number. On the higher slopes he noted mortar positions, subtle dots of sniper nests, flak guns ready to repel any plane that dared to stray too close to the gun-toting obelisk they inhabited. Unfortunately for Albert it had been a bumpy ride in a truck with some stern-faced Fallschirmjagers followed by a hike that had left his knees weak - no helicopter could reach this rarefied level of air. \n\nHe waved his hand at his binocular-toting secretary, and raised the pair to his eyes. The Italians too occupied a spot in the clouds, scant kilometres away, across tank traps, minefields, Czech hedgehogs and enough barbed wire to enclose Ost-Paris. He'd seen the reports, things were escalating here. More equipment, more men, bigger plans, the OKW had demanded it all and got it. He just prayed there would be no spark to light the fuse."

The gang of reformists that he had gathered around himself, so often attempting to assert their own will in place of his own, ceasing their bleating for one blessed moment? He had welcomed it. He wasn't quite sure what the final straw had been, there seemed to have been so much debate between them all in the smoky halls of the Volkshalle. All he knew was that when their respective secretaries made their morning calls, Messers Kiesinger, Erhard and Schmidt, and their families were not there. They had searched, naturally, and found themselves at the end of a trail that had could have been years in the planning, one last ratline in the event they didn't get their way.\n\nHe had raged, at first. It was a rare time he let his temper get the better of him, but that night was the first in a month of furious tantrums; against that Gang of Three with their conspiracies; against the Reich he had worked so hard to fix crumbling before his eyes; at himself. Most of all, however, he was afraid. He could feel the sharks circling. There were other, less enlightened members of the party that believed themselves more suitable for the task than he - and he was too dangerous to be left alive. \n\nHe was wrong. Oberlander had neutered him, shoved his hand up his arse and was now controlling him like a ventriloquist's dummy. No more allies meant no more Speer. Of that band of like-minded reformists, only von Tresckow remained, too loyal to his Prussian ideals to ever contemplate mutiny. Albert envied him that simplicity. Now his erstwhile allies were likely sunning themselves in America - all too eager to leave their Reich behind."

Margarete was out somewhere, not that they paid one another much attention these days. It was all too easy to simply spend the evening gazing into the fire, flick a piece of paper and watch it wither and curl. He had almost forgotten his book.\n\nIt didn't do to have traitors in the former ranks of such esteemed men as his current cabinet, so they had been removed. Every piece of paper they had signed was redacted. Every law they signed could be repealed, for it was a sabotage. Even their homes had been demolished, and mention of their names had been forbidden from any form of news. It didn't bear saying what had happened to their housekeeping staff. \n\nIn America no doubt they would be telling tales of the daring snub to the Reich, but here no news of their escape would ever run. People might ask what had happened to the ministers, but they would never get an answer - and eventually they would reach their own conclusions.  He returned to his book. \n\n"

It was only natural someone else take the reins, if only as a guiding hand. It seems denying culpability only gets you so far.

As such, all the awful, treasonous ideas of that clique of traitors would be collectively agreed to be eliminated - only this time, the shoe was on the other foot. It was his own ministers so eagerly dictating the removal of their predecessors' ideas. While Albert agreed with a few of these in principal, he most certainly disagreed with the gusto with which "his" ministers went about their business without consulting him. \n\nSpeer had always done his best to portray himself as the benevolent type of dictator, but that was becoming all the more difficult when his ministers' approach had shifted from velvet glove to iron gauntlet. The people had liked his new breed of more civil ministers, especially the students who had put him in this building in the first place. But god, if he didn't miss their bickering.

The open murder of former government officials claiming asylum was too brazen by half. They were instead watched from a distance, and Albert received reports on their activities every single day. \n\nHe recalled the mornings he had spent with Kiesinger, a cup of coffee and a sharp debate. Kurt had always been the easiest of them to deal with, the most realistic. Those talks had been spirited, but had never exasperated him nearly as much as that windbag Erhard. He had always seemed to have the right words to get what he wanted, and Speer would observe him running circles about him just as often as the other two. \n\nAlbert sipped his coffee and flicked through the report. Kiesinger had been talking to the Americans of course, who knew how long for. Every day he met with CIA agents, who were presumably digging for every scrap of information about Speer and his new government. Kurt would have them hanging on his every word for as long as he desired."

speer_natsoc.20.t:0 "Smoking with Schmidt"
speer_natsoc.20.d:0 "Schmidt was confusing. He had been deferential, polite, capable. At first, his only flaw had been the smoking. They'd actually had to increase the cleaning budget to deal with the buildup on the ceilings. But as time went on, something beneath was revealed. Schmidt did not like many of the people he worked with. He did not like many of the policies his government had. He seemed to dislike the Reich as an institution. \n\nNow of course, Speer knew that was exactly the case. Schmidt was a subversive, probably in league with Reichsbanner before he was forced to make his escape. While Erhard maintained himself by mooching off the economists of his host nation and Kiesinger was feeding the government information on a slow drip, Schmidt was openly denouncing his birth country, writing his tell all memoirs. The informants in his household had managed to acquire a photograph of a page for his perusal. "Inside the Third Reich" was a uniquely unflattering picture of Speer and his management, and alluded to many things Albert would have rather kept under wraps."

speer_natsoc.21.t:0 "Economics with Erhard"
speer_natsoc.21.d:0 "Erhard had been the most annoying of them all. Filled a seat like Göring, talked like he was Bismarck and smoked like a camp chimney. Certainly, Speer's management of the economy had not been miraculous, but the way Erhard had talked he wanted to tear it up by the roots made his blood boil. Now he was extolling the virtues of his own miraculous economic system, which would have saved the Reich from every damning flaw it had, real or imagined. \n\nThe Americans were eating it up by the sounds of it. His insights were being hailed as one of the best looks into the German system in decades, and he had apparently acquired his own coterie of "Continental Style" economists. Let them have the interminable naysayer. At least he could finally get a meeting done without having to open a window."

 usagertrade.15.desc:0 "The greatest nations of the world have founded themselves on trade. Rome defined itself by the mediterranean, their 'Mare Nostrum', while China, Portugal and Holland capitalised on spice flows to a greedy West. Humanity's first nations followed a similar origin point. Along the Indus, Yellow and Nile rivers, civilizations rose on the backs of boats carrying the boons of the agricultural revolution upstream and downstream. Preceding the building of any man's home is the greasing of palms, or a suitable means to begin doing so. \n\nModern nations follow the same principles. That's why, before the gun, a wise statesman has always picked the embargo; more discrete and far more vicious than it's lethal counterpart. Smith's prediction of a globalised economy has only assisted this balance further. One can defeat a breadless enemy before a single shot is fired. \n\nAll war must end, however, and today the economic war that the Reich and the United States have fought for decades is closing. The embargo has been lifted, and the lungs of the dormant commercial titan of the Hanseatic can breathe once more. Industrial works in the Ruhr bellow with a rejuvenated spirit, and the Germania Stock Exchange is entering what the American's call a 'bull market'. Both the Führer and the President have given optimistic speeches, celebratory words delivered from the Volkshalle and the White House, while their foreign ministries conclude business and return home in a better world. \n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise on an Atlantic at rest, with once bitter enemies shaking hands. In war, there are no winners, and in this peace history would seem to have produced two."

"You're saying there's a rebellion on?"\n\n"I'm not saying there's a rebellion, there IS a rebellion! They're all over the place!" The diplomat's voice crackled over the radio, the rattle of rifle fire occasionally making its way into the receiver. The fire was rapid, fast, and seemingly close. Helmut shifted as a mental picture began to form in his head.\n\n "So it's another slave rebellion. Well, shit, do what we did with the last one." He muttered into the phone, a hint of confusion mixing into his normal stately tone.\n\n "No, Helmut, you don't understand. This isn't some slave revolt. The whole fucking city is up in arms! They've got Reichsbanner flags, they're chanting-"\n\n"Reichsbanner?" A shot of excitement fired up Schmidt's spine, quickly followed by fear. This was simultaneously very good and very bad. "Shit, are you sure?"\n\n"We can't put this down! They've got guns, they've got ammo, I think they've stolen a few tanks- oh, shit!" The screeching of metal faintly pulsed through the receiver, quickly accompanied by the roaring of an angry crowd. "Fuck, ok, I've got to go. We're evacuating. Warschau is lost, repeat, Warschau is lost!" The line went dead with a slam.\n\nHelmut stood in disbelief, still glued to the phone.

Speidel, Schmidt, Kiesinger, Erhard, Tresckow- he could tell that each of them had rushed here on short notice. Their reactions were similarly varied- Speidel's calm exterior was betrayed by his deeply furrowed brow, Erhard and Tresckow both seemed worried, Kiesinger showed only mild interest, and Schmidt seemed to be almost excited at the thought. Speer regarded him with an extra stare before beginning. "So, give me a rundown."\n\n "Well, my Fuhrer-" Speidel began, but was quickly cut off by Schmidt's quick talking. "My Fuhrer, the Poles of Warschau have risen up, aided by the Reichsbanner. Apparently, this "Spartakus" has made his presence known there, and they're setting up for a potential counterattack. The Polish government is in disarray- they're trying to set up a new government, but they're not having a good time of it. The rebels have gone about freeing the slaves, lifting the Nuremberg laws, repealing restrictions-"\n\n "Why are you so excited about this, Helmut? They're fucking it all up! I've done so damn much for them and this is how they repay me? I don't know why I ever listened to any of you if all you do is give me problems!" Speer shouted, slamming his fist into the table. Schmidt recoiled, as did the rest of the gang- this was new.\n\nThe sudden silence was broken by the entrance of the secretary, delivering a new report to the Fuhrer.

Perhaps he should have expected this- Speer's revolt to the slave siege some time ago hadn't exactly been a reasoned one. "In any case, my Fuhrer, we can't truly have an effective response until we know how far this is going to spread. It'll do us no good to try and put out these fires while more are picking up."\n\n "Why don't you look yourself, Kiesinger? Here we are, with our plans unravelling before us, with everything the conservatives said would happen coming true, and you're all standing around here preaching the merits of the Reichsbanner? Hell, Schmidt's been basically on their side since he got here!" Speer snapped.\n\n "I never said I was in support of the slaves." Schmidt responded. Speer turned to him with an incredulous look.\n\n "Bullshit. You think I'm dumb, Helmut? I can see it on your face. You've been waiting for this for years." Schmidt opened his mouth to respond, but Kiesinger waved him off.\n\n "In any case, my Fuhrer, we must wait until the cards fall. This is certain to get worse before it gets better."

Every report that came in angered Speer even more, and only hardened his resolve against the other four men in this room.\n\nWhat a fool he was to trust them! Every step of the way, they had subverted his requests and gone against his orders. They had forced him, over and over, to agree with them and avoid collapse. Ever since he had brought them on, they had made his job harder than it ever had to be. And now, at the hour of Germany's greatest danger since World War II, here they were to subvert him again, poisoning his ideals and dragging Germany away from what made it such a power to start with.\n\nHe wouldn't take any more of it, he decided. From here on in, he would call the shots, not some petty idealists or fat capitalist or some old military man. As the report of the next city to fall- Minsk- came in, he made up his mind.

Speer reviewed them and pieced them together, a master architect building his latest work- not one of stone or steel, but one of statitistics. The cities that had revolted so far all fit the same few categories. Kiew, Warschau, Minsk, Krakow- all were poor, eastern cities. None had been successfully Germanized. Each still had significant amounts of slaves, whether personal or company owned. Finally, the major kicker- each had abnomally high levels of Reichsbanner activity. Perhaps it was the relatively young demographics of each city, or perhaps it was the universities, but the pattern was clear. A plan formed in Speer's head- this was still controllable. With the right analysis and the right plan, he could stop this rebellion in its tracks.\n\nAnd then a revolt seized Riga, and the statistics crumbled away.\n\nRiga shared none of these tells with the other cities, besides a high slave population. It held a significant German minority. It was rich, even after the chaos that had engulfed Ostland years ago. It had not even had a major Reichsbanner presence. Yet, here it was, another angry red mark of revolt splintering the Reich. Speer put the paper down on his desk to join the pile, sighed, and tore the rest of his analysis off the corkboard. Perhaps there was no pattern to this. Perhaps there was no stopping it."

As long as the revolt stayed inside the urban jungle, the Reich still stood.\n\nOf course, it didn't.\n\nSomehow, someway, the news spread to the slave plantations that still toiled in the countryside. One by one, the slaves found their spines, taking up arms against their masters and burning their fields to the ground. Mobs met each other and became armies, tearing through the countryside and burning any slaveowning home they found. Soon enough, the Wehrmacht found itself flanked, and- humiliatingly- was forced to retreat as the country slaves jubilously met with the students and rebels of the cities.\n\nAs the mood out east turned joyous, the mood in the Fuhrer's office darkened. Speer slammed his fist into his table, barely suppressing a angry yell. This was all that rat bastard gang's fault. They had played with fire, and now the whole Reich would burn."

While indentured servants in the former Russian lands are far less than across the rest of the Reich, they still make up a considerable number, and it seems that the general chaos gripping the entire German colonial empire has emboldened them.\n\nAll across the Reichskommissariat, tens of thousands of slaves break their chains and assault the German garrisons overseeing their suffering, taking their weapons and establishing pockets of resistance in the Russian plains. They ask for freedom, and most of them are ready to fight to the death rather than kneel once more. If they are to die - this is the message relayed to the Reichskommissar - they will die as free men.\n\nEven though their numbers swell with every passing day, and local authorities struggle to protect the cities from the increasing wave of dissent, it seems that - unlike the metropolitan Reich - reaction is mounting. Reports tell of German regular forces regrouping under the leadership of Feldmarschall Schörner, and preparing for a counter-offensive: the general has sworn to return order to the Russian Reichskommissariat, "no matter the cost"

When the gang reached the top, an armed officer saw them approach and thrust his hand into the air.\n\n"Heil Schörner!"\n\nFerdinand Schörner saluted in response. The traces of a smile were tugging at his lips, threatening to ruin his forcefully stern expression as he marched his men towards the cabinet room. At last, Moskau was his. Moskowien was his. The coup has been an absolute success, although naturally he had not been there to witness it.\n\nAnyone who dared resist the militarist infiltration of Moskau's government buildings – from the lowliest secretaries and guards to the highest politicians and generals – were shot on site. The rest were in the process of being deported to KZ like the traitors they were.\n\nThe men entered the cabinet room. Blood was splattered across the framed portraits that hung on the walls. Remer took a seat at the far end of the table and began speaking in a mockingly reedy voice, replicating Alexis von Roenne's mannerisms perfectly. The militarists cackled with laughter.  A gunshot rang out somewhere on the floor below them.\n\nThe Reich cried out for a savior as the waves of treason threatened to drown it forever, and Schörner answered the call. A thin smile finally spread across his face. How long until his men were storming Germania and dragging the liberal rats out of the Reichstag by their ties?"

However, this one was clearly more important than any other- the Fuhrer had even cleared out a space on his desk for it, an island of paper on a sea of hardwood. He looked up at the gang and placed a finger squarely on the text. "You want to know what this says?"\n\nSilence. Ashamed, total silence. No gang member even dared to stare into Speer's flaming eyes.\n\n "'Feldmarschall Schörner has, after his coup in Moskowien, seized control of revolting areas through swift, forceful action. From the little information we are currently receiving, Reichsbanner rebels have either retreated into hiding or fled." Speer read, matter of factly. He looked up again when he finished. Still, none of the others dared to respond. "You know what this means? It means that Ferdinand fucking Schörner is the Reich's face of stability and action, and we're standing around with our pants down!"\n\n "Well, my Fuhrer, Schörner has the luxury to just run over protestors with tanks-" Schmidt started. Speer cut him off with a furious wave of his hand.\n\n "And why can't we do the same? They're the rebels. If the American students started shooting at their soldiers, they wouldn't pussyfoot around with their response, would they?"\n\nSilence- a stunned, disbelieving silence- entered the room. Slowly, the gang filed out, and Speer sat back down. That was certainly too far, but was it not a justified outburst?

Bands of slaves roam the countryside and the cities, but without a unified leadership they act as they please: some merely try to return home, while others sack houses and stores, attacking all German settlers in sight."

Under the current circumstances, the first choice was preferred, though it is unknown whether the decision was motivated by humanity or lack of means.\n\nWith the German garrison gone, and the central government still reeling from the magnitude of what's happening, very few believe that the Reich will try to reclaim Galicia soon.

The central government has started to debate the best solution to fight the uprising, but unless drastic measures are taken immediately, the situation will most likely continue, and infect even more regions."

Soldiers on both sides dug in, from the forests of Lithuania to the fields of Ukraine. The Reichsbanner's rebellion had torn the Reich in half, literally- one half dominated by Schorner and his militarists, undoubtedly plotting for the final blow against Speer and his reformism. The other half digging in, trying to find some way to end the crisis before the winds of revolution spread further.

speer_slaverevolt.25.desc:0 "Amidst the chaos of the slave revolt, Kaukasien was almost completely overrun by the rebels, with only Baku resisting the onslaught thanks to massive influx of mercenaries from Moskowien and the metropolitan Reich. While most had thought these men were only paid by the corporations to protect the vital oil fields in the region, their presence had soon taken a more sinister meaning: day after day, the mercenaries and their enigmatic leader, a former SS-turned-mercenary named Otto Weidinger, took more and more power within the crumbling administration, taking advantage of the growing chaos to present themselves as the only ones with the means to protect Germany's interests.\n\nToday, in a shocking development, Weidinger's men stormed the main administrative compound and, after a brief firefight with the guards, took military control of the city. Baku's Gauleiter is currently being detained "for incompetence and corruption" until a "proper trial" can be held. The government in Germania immediately branded Weidinger's men as traitors and ordered their arrest, but even the Führer knows these are but empty words: with no way to transport troops to Baku due to the slave revolt, and the not-so-subtle threat of sabotaging the oil drills hanging in the air, the central government can only wait.\n\nSuspicions are arising, however, over a massive air lift paradropping weapons and supplies from Moskowien, paid for by corporations deeply tied to Abs, Flick and their clique of industrialists. While nothing is certain in these troubled times, few think this is a coincidence: questions will have answers in due time, and answers will prompt a response, the scope of which remains shrouded in the deepest darkness."

speer_slaverevolt.28.desc:0 ""Friends!"\n\nWilly Brandt's powerful voice reverberated across the packed crowds of Warsaw, the slaves, the free men, the reporters, the partisans; all were here, all were welcome. "We are all here because of the destructive monster that is known as the German Reich. The innumerable evils it has committed have shocked the world into silence - but no more! No longer shall Adolf Hitler's vile ideology spread any further, kill any more people!" A sort of frenzy of cheering was met in response, for but a moment drowning out the hopelessness and desperation. "I wish for you all to listen. I know of your hatred. All of it is deserved, all of it! To wish for my people to be thrown out of Europe for their crimes, but please- listen, listen to what I have to say! We must end this cycle of hatred here and now!" The cheering voices remained powerful, but quieter than before.\n\n"I know of a Germany - the true Germany, which the Nazis have attempted to eradicate," Brandt took in a deeper breath. "But it shall never die! The light of a democratic Germany can never be extinguished! There is a better future for Europe! We must not stand as slave and master, as Aryan and non-Aryan. We must stand as brother to brother, sister to sister, equal to equal! So please, on behalf of all of Europe, I beg you. Forgive us, for those who have been murdered by this regime never had the chance to!" His hands tightened into fists. His teeth grit harder. The people judged him with their silence. "Forgive us, oh, people of Europe, even if we do not deserve a shred of sympathy, those who know better will continue to fight for freedom." His voice trailed in strength and began showing cracks, and the air became stiff.\n\nWilly Brandt slowly landed on his knees, and bowed his head deeply. As the seconds passed, and nobody said anything, they could notice his frame shaking. And from the shaking, two tears dropped to the wooden platform. He expected the people to suffocate him with their silence, but as one man began to clap, so did ten, so did a hundred, so did a thousand. And as he looked up at those who dared to fight for their freedom, he let a wobbly smile come to his face."

He already knew where it would go, though. The man's words were weak, his case even weaker, his will perhaps the weakest. When the judge asked him to bow, he kneeled.\n\n"The court hereby declares Willy Brandt to be a traitor to the Reich. The sentence is death."\n\nHe had been in a few trials during his life, but none were as short and as decisive as this. When two men approached him, he struggled against the handcuffs that forced him to his bench, and even spat out a curse to one of the men - it meant nothing, however. The bag was stuffy and hard to breathe in, and it was almost impossible to see out of it. He felt bitter when he figured out where they were going. Just like the family of the Tsar in Russia, they would take him to a basement and murder him in cold blood. No martyrization. No publicization.\n\nWhen Brandt's head slammed against the concrete wall, his vision swam, and he could feel warm blood seep through his hair. Weakly, his limbs struggled against each other, in a vain attempt to get on his feet, as all the joy and idealism in the world faded from him. This was a Willy Brandt whose light in the world had faded, and though he believed in a Germany free and happy, his efforts had been torn down to nothing. Countless smouldered in death and ruin for his vision. When he heard the overpowering yell that signalled the end, Willy Brandt's hope died before he did."

Kiesinger cut the silence.\n\n"Speidel, you're saying we remain quiet?" The general nodded. "Right... and the hope in doing so is that the slaves will eventually reach out to us, seeing as how we will not plan any moves of our own."\n\n"If I may," Erhard cut in. "Shouldn't we move our troops away from the border, just to let them know that we don't mean any harm?" The moment he was done, his eyes flicked to the Führer, who began speaking as soon as Erhard bit the cigar between his teeth.\n\n"And let the bandits move in and pillage our German settlers?!" He shouted. The rest stared in silence. "Ridiculous, t-this is sheer insanity- they can't even control themselves to act peacefully, let alone we decide to give them so much trust that they do not deserve!"\n\nNobody spoke for the next few seconds, and Speer's eyes settled from one person to another, and then back again, and then back again, and his trembling hands scratched the table idly. "What are you looking at me for? Come on, speak! Pretend I'm not here! Bolsheviks, the lot of you, I..."\n\nSpeidel decided to return his look to Kiesinger and speak on his own behalf.

I am at the helm of Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, naturally, but I come to you with an offer. Your government has been deathly silent as of recent, and it is slowly beginning to unnerve the army of Free Europe. Some say that you are preparing for an attack, but I know better. Come, Helmut Schmidt. You have been the representative of Germany's more humane face, have you not? I ask you to present this letter to Herr Speer freely. I suppose, in the end, it is his letter to read. Now, here is what I have to say.\n\nWe shall hold a meeting in Warsaw, in the St. Alexander's Church. I pick it because it is a holy place, and no holy place should be a battlefield for violence. I will also ask you another, perhaps more important thing. As a show of peace, I ask of you to come with only you and your diplomats. There is no need for guns to march between priests and crosses. I am uncertain if you shall follow through with this, but if you do, I will remain ever grateful for the move.\n\nAnd my final statement will be this. To Herr Speer, to you, Helmut Schmidt, to Ludwig Erhard, to Kurt Georg Kiesinger, to Henning von Tresckow. I should congratulate you all for taking Germany so far. It was as dark as shadows before, and for a while I had feared for its existence. But my hope has strengthened, and I am joyous that the free, humane, and democratic Germany still lives. Thank you for your cooperation, and if all goes well, I shall be seeing you soon.\n\n - Willy Brandt."\n\nThere was no time to ponder. Helmut Schmidt had to choose."

It was as if Schmidt was thrown into a different universe altogether. Where none of this madness was forced to happen.\n\nThere were only four faces he saw. The only one he recognized by face was Willy Brandt, but he could recognize the others by association. One was Karol Józef Wojtyła, a Catholic priest who Schmidt could immediately recognize in his clothing. Another was Viacheslav Chornovil, though he did not know much of him, and the last was Nadezhda Troyan, former NKVD agent and assassin of Wilhelm Kube. He did not like her beliefs, though respected her guts to do such a thing. All of them, however, remained silent, as Brandt approached him.\n\n"Well, if it isn't the famous Helmut Schmidt." With a wide smile, he brought his hand out and the two gave each other a strong handshake. "I take it that you are a bit more sympathetic to our cause than that friend of yours you call Herr Speer?"\n\nSchmidt, at first, bit his tongue. He didn't want to risk saying the wrong thing - but then he realized just where exactly he was. "Friend..." He huffed a laugh through his nose. "Is not exactly what I would call him, but that's neither here nor there. It will be a pleasure to negotiate these dealings with you, Herr Brandt. I have much reason to support your cause."\n\nBrandt gave Schmidt a sharp look and a sly smile. "To support implies that you have done nothing yet to aid the cause of the Reichsbanner." When he said that, Schmidt was filled with the need to take a step back out of anxiety, but instead let out an amused yet nervous chuckle."

"I could not guarantee their safety, though there would be hell to pay if anyone decided to commit violence to them." Brandt let out a short laugh. "Good, good. Now, the final demand." He cleared his throat.\n\n"On the matter of repatriation. I demand that Germany begin immediate and extensive reparations to all slaves and their families.

Gunther had been there for an interrogation, and the bruises had taken almost a month to go away, but this time it was different: he and his companions reached the reception, where an officer very similar - perhaps a bit too much - to the one who had broken two of Magdalene's ribs with a kick during the last year's rally sat.\n\n"Motivations of your presence?" he spat recognising Hans, who had broken his nose with a brick last September.\n\n"We are here to request a permission according to Section 2, Paragraph 1 of the Law on Manifestation of Political, Social and Economical Thought" was Gunther's uncertain answer. When the officer's hand disappeared under the desk, the small group trembled, but when it reappeared it held a small handbook with practical indications for the police: with a grimace, he read aloud.\n\n"Extract from the Law on Manifestation of Political, Social and Economical Thought, as approved by the Reichstag and published in the Reichsgesetzblatt [GetDateText].\nSection 1, Paragraph 1: "manifestation of political, social and economical thought is free in accordance of the provisions contained within this law"\nParagraph 2: "the conducts described in the above Paragraph are subject to authorization by the Ordnungspolizei"\nParagraph 3: "the conducts described in Paragraph 1, if lacking the authorization mentioned in Paragraph 2, are punishable according to administrative and criminal law"\nSection 2, Paragraph 1: "The authorization mentioned in Section 1, Paragraph 2 is to be requested to the local office of the Verwaltungspolizei within the Ordnungspolizeidivision district"\nParagraph 2: "the request must, under penalty of rejection, contain: A) exact itinerary of the manifestation; B) names of the promoters; C) insurance that the manifestation will not result in C1) violence; C2) illicit conducts; C3) delegitimation of the Reich and its organs"\n\nWith each word, the officer's frown deepened, but he knew his duty. When Gunther gave him the request, he examined it, and when at the third look he couldn't find anything illegal, he stamped it and put it in his desk. The small group cheered, but went silent when the man in uniform gave them a withering look, and a stern warning."

Our greatest reward!"\nHe took a small paper and read aloud: "Law on Freedom of Manifestation, as approved by the Reichstag and published in the Reichsgesetzblatt [GetDateText], to be entered into force the day of its publication.\nParagraph 1 (and only), Section 1 (and only): "Manifestation of human thought is free"\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers, chanting and hugging each other, then Magdalene took the megaphone: "For years we have longed for justice, for freedom! Today we fulfill our dream, today is the day that Germany finds its path towards a new future! A future of justice and equality, of freedom and friendship! More than anything, today we begin our road to redemption!"\n\nThe crowd could no longer be contained in the square, and the roads were filled with cheering people, men and women, young and old. The police managed to keep the people from reaching the ORPO station, causing several wounded, but this didn't change the results: they had been defeated. Perhaps it would take time , but their black uniforms would become a mere reminder of what had been, and would soon fade into the past.\n\nThe final moment of the rally was when the promoters read the names of those who had been killed during the past manifestation: "martyrs of freedom" whose names and deeds would "never be forgotten". As the sun started disappearing under the line of the horizon, the people intoned the last chant."

The Minister of Foreign Affairs had his reservations, and, while her words didn't necessarily help him, it pushed him along. With a sigh, he spoke.\n\n"I agree on the part that the Reich can use more parties besides the NSDAP.

Four decades of political oppression and single-party system finished the job, and now most Germans had become used to living in a country where political freedom simply didn't exist. It was with surprise, therefore, that the people of Germania saw a new newspaper sold by the kiosks: its name was "Die Kurierdienst" and the news that occupied the entire first page was a bomb.\n\n"POLITICAL FREEDOM RETURNS TO THE REICH"\n"After the last round of negotiations between the government and the protesters, an agreement was reached.

He pointed to and circled around Ukraine with his finger. "M-Mister Schmidt," he began, tapping on the capital of Kiew, which was scribbled over and the word 'Kyiv' written on it. "All this talk about slavery and laws and such is great, but there's something I've wanted to bring up. My dear home of Ukraine, you see, I've always felt like it's had so much potential." Schmidt raised an eyebrow. He was certainly talkative. "I could imagine it, the democratic principle; the Reich, however, well, they've chosen not to allow any of it. Even after massacring my people, they haven't given us any gift. Not even a token one."\n\nSchmidt's stomach sunk. Generalplan Ost was a specter that would haunt Europe forever, wouldn't it? "Am I to assume this is talking about allowing democratization of members of the Einheitspakt?"\n\nViacheslav nodded enthusiastically. "You're quick on your feet, Mister Schmidt! That's exactly what it's about! A healthy nation holds elections and elects people who know what they're doing, where they're doing it, and how! I want that - the liberalization, I mean - to be applied in full force across Europe in the countries that Germany keeps putting under its heel. What about it, Mister Schmidt? Is that a deal?"\n\n"Well..." Schmidt rubbed the back of his neck. "This action would cause uproar back home. As tense as the situation is right now, I'm uncertain if we can afford it. The political capital needed to be expended in order to allow free elections in the Einheitspakt, notwithstanding the conditions in Germany itself..."\n\nViacheslav waved his hand dismissively.

"You sound like a machine," he said, and Marzena looked a bit annoyed, but still undeterred.\n\n"Apparently, they're going to allow elections in Poland now. There's just a bit of a problem, however."

"Men and women, I've just been told by someone that Brandt convinced that German bastard to allow elections in Lithuania! Not only that, but everywhere else, too! We can finally get the damn Nazi boot off our necks- i-it's not much, but it's a step forward!"\n\nThere was an aura of silence that suddenly overcame the room.

It was silly enough to make Aušra smile in contempt- but when she heard one man clap and another man whistle, and a woman start cheering and another start laughing, she instinctively reached to clap her hands together herself, smile turning from contempt and mockery to a genuine sense of relief.

It caught Schmidt off-guard, as he himself was deep within the confines of his own thoughts, so as he stirred himself to attention and turned to face the man, he was already continuing.\n\n"I suppose I should let you know. Not that it is wise of me to do so, but... well, I've already started, haven't I?" Schmidt leaned against the tinted window, waiting. Brandt looked to have traces of nervousness rise in his throat - and both men were surprised, Schmidt more so. "I'm... going to flee to the U.S. I thought I should let you know. I cannot assist you in Germania or elsewhere. All that would net me would be a hanging. A shame, but... at least Reichsbanner has done its duty."\n\nSchmidt gave a slow, understanding nod.

Something tells me... if I come home, to Berlin, I will see that Speer has gone mad, and that it will all end there. Then it will truly be the last days of Europe. Maybe it's my growing paranoia."\n\nBrandt stayed silent for the next few seconds, contemplating his words. Then he spoke. "Herr Schmidt... think it over again. Are you so certain that everything you have done is for naught?" Schmidt felt the anxiety creep up his mind. "Tell me," Brandt began, his eyes turning to gaze into the other man's own, and he looked at Schmidt with an utmost sense of clarity. "I want your answer to be the most honest it can be.

So bad that he was starting to feel sick, but now was no time to take a vacation. Schmidt had to push through to the end. Even if it meant pushing through the meeting that Speer had called him to.\n\nLight-headed and feeling weak, Schmidt stepped into Speer's office. He was already sitting there, palms clasped against each other, fingers interlocked neatly as if he had been there for hours, waiting for just the right person to arrive - and, by the look on Speer's face, he had just received his visitor. "Herr Schmidt. I'm glad you've arrived. I won't ask you to take a seat, simply that I've been wanting to tell you something. Ever since you forced my hand to abolish the Nuremberg laws-" Why did he go? Why didn't he call in sick?

There is nothing wrong."\n\nSpeer gave a nod. "That's very good. In that case, I figure that you already know what I'm going to ask of you, but, it's been long, long overdue.

But Schmidt couldn't worry himself forever - he had to continue.\n\nSo when Schmidt entered the Reichskanzlei and stepped into the long, glossy hallway, the lights from the patterned glass above shone down into the room and illuminated none other than Albert Speer. Next to him were what he immediately recognized as members of the Ordnungspolizei. Schmidt almost mistook the skip of his heartbeat as a heart attack.\n\n"Herr Schmidt." His tone was a casual one, but Schmidt couldn't mistake the intention. It was as if Speer was the one in control here. "I'm ordering your immediate arrest. I suggest you do not flee." He was pressed into going on the backfoot. To turn and run - no, things were different now. It was no longer the Führer who had his strings attached everywhere he went. The situation had changed.\n\nHelmut Schmidt shook his heads, and the Ordnungspolizei stopped moving towards him, standing halfway between Speer and Schmidt. "I'm afraid not, my Führer." He could already see the hatred begin to burn brighter in his eyes, and how his hands began trembling. "There will be no arrest. You should be aware that there is absolutely no reason why this order should be carried out. Do you have a reason, my Führer? You do not need one to arrest me, but you and I both know that doing so would cause your support to turn on you."

Such a noble organization - in his mind, at least - stomped into the ground by the NSDAP, and then fading into irrelevance; and then, like a flash, it ruptured from its grave and returned as a major power, going head to head with Germany itself to negotiate the terms of freedom. Yet Schmidt had disappointed Brandt.\n\n"What is it, Brandt?"\n\nThey discussed the matters of protesting, too. Both men were in agreement about how important it was to showcase that the nation did allow itself to display that the people were free, that they had a voice. But what Schmidt differed from Brandt was how to go about it. Brandt scrutinized Schmidt for a while after they came to terms, to determine if he truly believed that the time for protesting was a transformation, a process that had to be carefully managed, or was it something else?\n\n"Are you a coward?"\n\nSchmidt felt the question was like a dagger pressed to his heart. He knew that Brandt had wanted to press him, but this... being so blunt and so direct contrasted the previous, friendly nature that the man had shown him. Doubt coursed through his mind, and as Brandt stared at him with that same look he gave after Schmidt offered his suggestion of a compromise, words failed him momentarily.

And while so many looked sad, bitter, depressed, even - so many more were happy, overjoyed, clinking glasses with one another and sitting around and sharing stories, tales, poems, confessions.\n\n"Schmidt..." The slurred voice of Willy Brandt alerted Schmidt to his presence, and he turned his head to see the revolutionary smile tiredly towards him. "I'm... glad you listened." The shot glass in his hand was unsteady as he dangled it over the edge of the church's top floor. Then Brandt turned from looking at Schmidt to looking at the city. "I was w-worried, frankly, that- well, no need to bring your spirits down. You want a drink, Schmidt?" A distinct lack of 'Herr', but neither man seemed to mind.\n\nHesitance painted his words. "... Sorry, Herr Brandt. Not much of a drinker. I'm also a diplomat, and diplomats should probably lay off the alcohol," he said, pointedly giving a half-serious glare towards Brandt, who looked at him with a smile that cracked into grin after a few seconds. Schmidt himself eventually gave a smirk.\n\n"Quit staring at me like that, Schmidt, it's-" He gave out a short laugh. "Stop!" Schmidt could feel his own lips quivering, and, perhaps to save face or just to listen to Brandt's demands, he turned away before he succumbed to Brandt finding it funny. "You know, Schmidt... you might still be a Nazi in the eyes of the people, but to me, you're... you're a better man than anyone in Germania's high castle."\n\nSchmidt suddenly felt a pang of embarrassment. A strong fear and source of doubt kept pulling at his consciousness - that he would be cast down into the annals of history as a traitor and a Nazi.

 speerphase3.1.desc:0 "The heat beat down on his body and his muscles ached and everything about this was things he hated - he felt like he wanted to vomit, an alarm blaring him awake after only 4 hours of sleep that was forced by two hours of strenuous exercise and having to listen to lectures about this and that. The things Erik had to do to join this newly-formed anti-terrorist group made him regret coming, but how could he back out now?\n\nWith the swastika emblazoned on his urban camouflage clothing, a variety of utilitarian tools at his side and a rifle that slung over his back, he and a couple of other RSG-9 members had hastily exited their barracks and made their way to an abandoned two-story house that was repurposed as a building to practice hostage rescue scenarios. It was deep into the night when they pulled up and prepared themselves, reciting through the countless hours of forced listening they had to go through.\n\nThat brought him here. When Erik kicked in the door, he felt his head go light, but procedures had to be followed, and through the pain that pulsed across his body, the headache that made his mind feel raw and vulnerable, and the resulting gunshots that rung his ears as he screamed out methodical orders to both would-be terrorists and his own two men, he wondered to himself; wandering through with gun and flashlight, nerves frayed yet still on edge - what would his skills be pressed for? The former slaves? The students? ANTIFA? None seemed particularly dangerous, yet Erik was put through hell for a reason only the higher-ups would know. He could only theorize one answer."

 speerphase3.2.desc:0 "Cold water splashed Ludwig Erhard's face, and he breathed heavily for a moment. Wrongly applied it, too much - was he in some stupor, in some panic? Of course he wasn't, but why did he feel so nervous? Erhard looked at himself in the mirror. Things had developed far since the devastation of the civil war. With his genius, Germany pulled itself out of the rubble and soared once again. Then came all of his reforms, as dangerous as they were, as utterly maddening it was to many, it worked. Too well, in fact.\n\nNothing good can last forever. Germany's economy was strong, but built on glass links. It was a powerhouse, yet when the oil crisis had come to strike Germany, it bled like a stuffed pig, too weak to fend itself as it relied on its shared feed. Not only that, people were waking up to the fact that not all was well. They would demand change, and if there was anything Erhard hated, it was his efforts being undone.\n\nWith a sigh, Erhard shut the lights to the bathroom and prepared to go to sleep; his mind was overfilled with thoughts, though he knew that there was always more work to be done. He could have time to think on it tomorrow, about something new for Germany. A plan that could revitalize it once and for all and scrub the new issues that plague it."

 speerphase3.3.desc:0 "Microphones were such useful things.\n\nThe grandiosity of the Volkshalle was truly resplendent. If he had tried to carry his voice with his body alone, his vocal cords would have shredded long before it arrived on the other side. As the elderly man carefully adjusted it so that it wouldn't shower his fellow members of the Reich with noise, he felt a smile creep up on his face. Everything had gotten so much easier ever since Speer had managed to make his moves. The almost endless stress was beginning to fade, and for once, the speech he would give was not doused in boundless irritation and anger. Instead, it would be a pleasant one. Much smoother than the ones given while slaves overran Europe.\n\n"My people," he began, and already the energy coursed through him. "Who have managed to show the world their power. Their industrial prowess, their technological ingenuity, their architectural genius. My people - our people-" Speer took a deep breath. It was good to be back. "The sons and daughters of the Greater German Reich-"\n\n"WE-"\n\n"SOAR-"\n\n"AGAIN!""

 speerphase3.4.t:0 "As To Prometheus A Flame"
 speerphase3.4.desc:0 "Henning von Tresckow eyed the contents of the letter carefully. His thumb softly pressed against the signature. It was Albert Speer's - unmistakeable, and difficult to forge. What it had contained... made him just the slight bit anxious. He would no longer be the only Generalfeldmarschall in the Reich. For the sake of 'stability' and 'diversifying the strengths of National Socialism'. Vague nothingness like that. He felt the slightest bit of irritation, but, what could he do? Though he had his fair share of connections, nothing could stand up to Speer's decision.\n\nLudwig Erhard groaned when he had read the letter that arrived at his table. Speer's antics had cropped up once more. Now he was to be the co-Minister of Economics and Labor. What nonsense was this? Did Speer think so little of his efforts to brighten the future of Germany's economy - and succeeding heartily, at that - only to be forced to share space with what was likely some faceless bureaucrat? He would have marched into Speer's office then and there upon receiving the news, but... his friends within the Reich dwindled, and he knew what Speer was doing, and Speer knew what he was doing.\n\nHelmut Schmidt felt his teeth grind together when he was approached by a messenger. His position as Minister of Foreign Affairs would now have to be effectively separated in two, listening and consulting with another Minister who would effectively serve as an equal co-partner. When he heard the name, Schmidt knew nothing of whoever this person was, and that's when it had hit him. With this one, simple move, Schmidt's power within the cabinet was cut in half. Not only that, but the doors had closed around him. There was nowhere to turn to. Nowhere to discuss and raise protests with."

 speerphase3.5.t:0 "A German Rose Blooms"
 speerphase3.5.desc:0 "The massive map that stared Speer in the face was quite a lovely sight to behold. It was an incredibly detailed map of Europe, stretching from one end to the other, and the details were all lovingly crafted and placed with great detail. He felt particularly pleased when he observed the Einheitspakt. Germany's territorial expansion bloomed - so much territory, so densely packed, so rich with people, industry and resources, it filled him with a sense of joy, that the Reich truly was the dominator of Europe.\n\nBut the Gang of Four had forced his hand into doing something that he was never truly satisfied with. The Reichskommissariats were an inefficient thing, a product of a past era - riddled with corruption and slavery. He could understand the concerns of some with the concept of the Reichsländer, but to Speer, the idea was such that he couldn't possibly pass it by. Direct subjects of the Reich, with a vague semblance of freedom; while they would never officially undergo the process of Germanization, seeing that it was well and truly too expensive and risky of a process, they would still be influenced by German civilization.\n\nThat night Speer had decided. The collaborationists had to go. The natives wouldn't be pleased with it, and he would have to make it a slow process, but he knew, in his heart, that this would be better for all. For the Reich to receive its just rewards of victory, and for the men and women of the East to be taught their place. They needn't become Aryans, no, though in time they would come to appreciate the finely crafted machine that was German culture. No, they needed to do only one thing."

 speerphase3.6.t:0 "End of a New Beginning"
 speerphase3.6.desc:0 "Here he was again. Albert Speer did not visit the city of Linz too often. He found it beautiful, yes, but there were so many other things that had occupied his time that he could not spare a visit to it. Now, however, he felt at ease. When Adolf Hitler had died, his body had been transported to Germania and been given a proper burial and a memorial service even as the civil war had raged on - but Speer, with his personal funds, and over the course of the decade, had asked, petitioned, and convinced for the body of Hitler to be moved to Linz. His love of the city was strong, and in turn, so was Speer's.\n\nNot only that, however. His body did not deserve to be in a mere grave to rot. Instead, Speer had built a mausoleum for his predecessor, and he had meticulously planned every inch of it. As he stood in front of the tomb that housed his paternal figure, he smiled. Everything about it was right. All the details, the vaguely religious yet still National Socialist elements that covered the inside. Perhaps, in a way, this was his greatest work yet - barring Germania, of course.\n\nBut he hadn't come merely to admire his own architectural genius. No, there was something more. There was a man he had respected for as long as he had lived, and now he had passed. Yet Speer never truly gave him the proper respect he deserved. For without him, there would be no Reich to begin with - but without Speer, the Reich would not have survived. As he kneeled in front of the tomb, he uttered no prayer, he made no motion of bowing to a deity. Instead, his was a silent admiration of the highest degree.\n\nEverything Albert Speer had learned from his father was now passed on to him, yet reshaped, moulded to serve the rapidly-changing future. Would he have understood it? Speer wouldn't know; but he would have respected him. For now there was no need to play nice with the enemies of the Reich. Power was his, and no other's. He was the NSDAP, and the NSDAP was his. A sort of tingling pride was felt in him, a sensation that he was, as treacherous as it would have been to say, an even better leader than he who had guided him all those years. As Speer stood up, having finally paid his dues, his mind was steeled, and his goal was simple. The only path was forward. The only solution was one."

 speerphase3.7.t:0 "Sixteen Eyes And One Opportunity"
 speerphase3.7.desc:0 ""You know,"\n\nIt was Erhard's second shot glass of the night. The entire Gang had gathered themselves in a fine restaurant in Germania that was bereft of any Nazi ensignia, just to celebrate the night. "Schmidt." He said, pointedly staring at the minister who was eating some meat. "Have you ever thought that you would get this far?"\n\n"Oh, the musings of a drunk economics minister," Tresckow cut in, giving a light smile. "No need to ask him such pointless questions about the past." Erhard found that ironic, considering who Tresckow was, but the small grin didn't betray such an emotion to the Prussian, it seemed. "Like the tracks of a tank, they are meant to push forwards, not backwards!" As Schmidt finished up and wiped his mouth with a napkin, he gave a short cough.\n\n"Gentlemen." He began, giving a short nod. "I didn't expect to get this far, no, but we are here now. While Speer is now practically our puppet legislator-" He seemed particularly pleased at being able to say those words with genuinity. "Much of Germany is still against us, the NSDAP particularly. If we want to keep our gains, we'll have to strike hard and fast."\n\nKiesinger spoke up for the first time since they began dining. He was particularly quiet, it seemed, and the rest were a bit surprised when they heard him talk. "I concur. Tomorrow, the memories of this dinner will fade, and we must all continue working earnestly. However, we did call this meeting specifically so that we could take some time off. After all, we discuss with each other enough about our plans, don't we? I believe this night is one of a deserved break. Wouldn't you all agree?"\n\nSchmidt didn't seem fully pleased with Kiesinger wanting to cut it short, but, eventually he had to give in. Perhaps his mind needed some rest - perhaps he didn't have to think about everything at once for a few hours."

 speerphase3.8.t:0 "Better The Devil You Know"
 speerphase3.8.desc:0 "In Weimar there was a conference, all meeting in secret. They were the Gang of Four, and men who represented the fledgeling democratic movement in Germany; of the numerous there, three stood out. Richard von Weizsäcker, Günter Grass and Axel Springer. Though their political differences ranged from mild to severe, they all shared a unified goal. A free Germany, rid of Nazi ideology - and what would have been a long, in-depth conversation in secrecy had its bearings shattered and torn out when a certain someone made an unexpected visit.\n\n"I have seen your efforts, dear friends of mine," Hermann Josef Abs spoke, standing in the doorway as seven faces stared at him, a mix of fear, worry, and shock. Abs locked eyes with Erhard, who seemed positively disgusted, and he gave a sharp smile. "If you are concerned that I am here because of the destruction of IG Farben, have no worry. My interests are much more than a mere slavedriver company in Germany. I have something far more valuable that remains, and shall remain, fully untouched. It is, however, something I can offer you all."\n\nErhard's hand shook, and he was tempted to slam it on the table, to demand that he get out. Yet Schmidt's voice cut through the air, and his tone was much more neutral, if not even interested. "Herr Erhard has made me aware that your main shareholder is Deutsche Bank. Is that your 'something' you are referring to?"\n\nAbs nodded, taking a step into the room. "National Socialism is dying. The NSDAP doesn't understand that, but you all do. The writing on the wall is obvious, my friends. With power in your hands, I expect you all to begin the push for a Germany that sheds its old, egregiously brutal skin for something new and more humane." Erhard resigned himself into angered yet horrified silence. "And you know what, Herr Schmidt?""

It sounds like you're in a phone booth. Actually, no, don't answer that question, I can tell you're in a phone booth, as your office in the Reichskanzlei doesn't sound like it's crammed with vehicles buzzing their horns all the time. Anyways- I've had a realization today."\n\nSchmidt furrowed his eyebrows. "Really now? A realization? Ludwig, you said that this was important-"\n\n"Because it is!" He cut in, giving a sigh. "You remember Kurt's plan with the Reichsländers? A stupid thing. Just to appease Speer. Well, now that doesn't matter anymore. We don't need to mock the natives by installing Germans or Nazi collaborators as well as barely lifting the restrictions they had during the time of the Reichskommissariats. Things must change, Helmut. We need to get rid of this relic of the past - give it something new."\n\n"... then..." Schmidt bit his lip for a moment. He was right - they couldn't stick to the policies that were there just to bend the knee to the hardliners of the NSDAP. All it would do was prolong the inevitable. "... call the other members of the Gang. We'll have to discuss this in detail, preferably today. I agree to your proposal, Ludwig. I just need to gather my thoughts. We'll meet again soon."\n\nThe message to Erhard was clear. With an invisible nod, Erhard spoke. "Alright. I will see you soon, Helmut.""

 speerphase3.10.t:0 "End of a New Beginning"
 speerphase3.10.desc:0 "Here he was again. Helmut Schmidt had been to so many places, yet he had rarely ever visited his own city of Hamburg. His birthplace, his sacred home. Perhaps he was afraid of coming back to it and to be swallowed in its memories, as then and even now, there was no time to afford for traces of weakness. But things had changed. Things were different now. As Schmidt walked through the rich morning of the city, where his eyes would have focused on vain, oversized Nazi banners were residents in apartments living out their daily lives; where he would see soldiers patrolling the streets, there were men and women fighting for a better Germany. Raising the banner of freedom, to voice their anger in protests that shook the city's peace.\n\nThe city was no longer familiar to Schmidt, but nostalgia still pulled him inwards. Hitler and his regime had built it up in such a way that even when he had visited Barmbek, the old village where he spent his childhood days, there was barely anything that resembled what he had known for two decades, and he had walked through it like he would have any other district. There was one place, however, that would remain unchanged - and it was just next to Barmbek.\n\nThe Außenalster always remained the same. He knew the Nazis couldn't have tainted its water. Somewhere along the coast, Schmidt had stood at the edge of the water and stared as all the sailing boats passed. He remembered being on one with his father as a child, demanding to go back in and loop around when they were done. Now there were so many others. People, sometimes alone and sometimes together, and sometimes with their children, enjoying themselves in a way that was now alien to him. Yet the air was so much lighter now. Ten years since Schmidt had entered into the dark tunnel, the light had begun to pour in. So much fear, so much anxiety, contrasted by the serenity of the peace that he felt while in Hamburg.\n\nSchmidt looked down at his arm. That bright, burning reminder that seared his flesh and assaulted his mind whenever he looked at it. The armband he wore that was a constant reminder that he deserved to be afraid, deserved to die. But no more would he force himself to follow the orders of a mad man. He had done what many could never do. He did not feel prideful for it, as a man who dodges a death sentence would feel proud about avoiding the inevitable. Instead, as his fingers tugged under the fabric, and it slid across his arm, he felt relief. Sheer, unmitigated relief.\n\nWhen the armband slipped from his wrist and slid against and out from the grasp of his fingers and landed in the water with a silent thump, Schmidt breathed. Everything felt so much clearer than it did before. He could finally live. His judge, jury, and executioner would never pursue him again. But there was work to do, and so Schmidt turned around and began walking. He knew what he had to do."

Instead it has unlatched itself from its old ways and now floats aimlessly in this new world, attempting to cling on to both the past as a giant who conquered Europe and beat back the imperialist world powers, and the present, as a dove wishing to extend the olive branch, either out of a sense of good will, or sheer pragmatism.\n\nOur new order cannot shift and ebb and be so fluid as it was before. If it is to become the rock that will bear the coming storm, Germany cannot be everchanging. It must steady itself - it must not rock the boat, and it must find its way forwards.

Yet now, decades later, we see that there is something new brewing.\n\nThe Oil Crisis has struck the world as a knife to exposed flesh. It has exploited the weakness found in all of the blocs that encompass the world, every superpower attempting to take it on by themselves, only to find that such a course of action is not only inefficient, but actively detrimental.\n\nAlong with it, the revolt of the slaves has shown Germany that it cannot stand alone. We have made token efforts to appease the other two superpowers, true, but it is finally time for the Reich to stand together in full earnest with the rest.

An insight into Japanese politics tells us that there is heavy friction about the idea that China could ever possibly be anything more than a puppet to the Sphere, and thus their internal stability is beginning to fall.\n\nIt's advised to pursue stronger diplomatic and trade relations with the Organization of Free Nations - particularly the U.S. The state of their internal politics is much stronger than that of Japan, and they have a massive and still growing economy that we could expand our interests into, as well as having a large surplus of raw and refined goods.

One that would have the intent of safeguarding peace across the planet, as war only serves to further destroy the economies of the nations affected. It would also serve as a way to bring all of our nations closer - think of it as global cooperation. The name of it is simple; the Koalition der Nationen.

And with the Gang of Four out of his way, and the NSDAP following his will and his voice, he would make the finishing touches to his precious Reich - his final test, that came not in the form of a revolt, or dealing with dissent. It came as a goal to secure the future of the Thousand Year Reich.\n\nThe Koalition der Nationen transcended all of his previous architectural goals. Germania would be merely a backdrop in comparison as to what will come. Albert Speer's will was powerful, and after having dealt with the brunt of the Reich's issues all at once, he pulled out victorious. This time, however, he would have to cement his legacy forever.

speerescalation.4.t:0 "Garmr Has Broken Free"
speerescalation.4.desc:0 "Germany's forefathers, the norse Aryans of the North, believed that one day Götterdämmerung, or Ragnarök, would envelop the world. The first sign of this end of days would be when a great Wolf, Garmr, broke free from his chains and was set loose. Following this, countryman would turn on countryman. Brother on brother. Earth would be torn asunder. \n\nHe had left it too late. He had not put Garmr back in chains. No, he had been a fool. An idiot, all things considered. That devil in the east, Schörner, was a rabid dog in every sense of the word. Foul, vicious and savage. Speer knew that when an animal goes feral, there is only one humane choice, for it and for all around it: putting the dog down. Yet he hadn't. Out of some fear, or stupid sympathy, or pure idiocy, Speer had led the dog roam free. Now, he had to endure the reports as they came in, live through that newfangled television of his. \n\nMurder. Massacre. Wholesale slaughter of slaves in the East. Was this Speer in the mirror? Was Schörner just a reflection of the great architect? When he looked at the white marble of Germania, would Speer see anything in his own artistry but the bloodied tapestry of sinews that the Generalfeldmarschall had constructed across the Reichskommissariats? And it was a tapestry. Slavic bodies flung carelessly around. Mass graves dug. Who knows how many thousands more will be killed in the coming weeks? Schörner had what he wanted. The dog was putting his master down. \n\nHe had lost. Now, he would be a Führer only in name. With the students nearing rebellion, the slaves openly revolting, and Speer's underlings turning against him, he felt his dreams disappear. He stood up from his desk, and stood in front of one of the many bookshelves of the Kanzler's office. The Poetic Edda stood out to him. He smiled, with a hint of melancholy. How fitting. He turned to stanza forty-five, and read aloud, alone in the room. \n\n"Brothers shall fight and fell each other, \nand sister's sons shall kinship stain. \nHard is it on earth, with mighty whoredom. \nAxe-time, sword-time, shields are sundered, \nWind-time, wolf-time, 'ere the world falls.""

speerescalation.7.t:0 "Looking Forwards"
speerescalation.7.desc:0 "As a man endures his sixties, he begins to ponder his life. In Germany, most men retire during this twilight decade, putting down the hammers and quills and moving into a life of family and comfort. The free men do, anyway.\n\nKurt's father had been a free man. For him, sixty was only the two-thirds checkpoint in his life, and he lived a happy final third with the wealth of a bank clerk. A shining example of the protestant work ethic, and a reaper of its rewards. He'd only died recently, Kurt remembered. Was it just last year? Time seemed a blur nowadays.\n\nKurt wasn't a man built for retirement. If time was a blur, his duty was not. With the Führer occupied in Moskowien, the student protests continued to cripple the heart of the Reich, and the old Silver Tongue was not about to let the opportunity for a reformed Germany descend into chaos and violence so quickly. Fingers drum on the table as the Deputy Führer stares coldly into middle distance, listening. The sound of a phone being picked up, and Kiesinger begins.\n\n"These lines are not secure, so I shall keep it brief. You know the location already. Where the griffin flies and the seas are sweet with trade. Next Thursday, be at the pier. Let us keep this brief." \n\nAnd like that, Kiesinger hung up the phone. His suitcase for an overnight stay had already been prepared in his room. A plane for Rostock had been organised, and if the Führer couldn't quell the Devil, then his Deputy would have to make a pact himself."
speerescalation.7.a:0 "A truce to terror."

speerescalation.9.t:0 "House of Cards"
speerescalation.9.desc:0 "To Erhard, it appeared as if the house of cards was finally collapsing. Was Speer more tolerable than the Nazi scum before him? Of course. Was his demise in any way an upset to the Minister for the Economy? Not in the slightest. As the Führer's crisis continued to worsen, the man behind the facade of kindness and polite diplomacy had shrunk away, and the demon that Erhard had always seen behind those glassy eyes and forced smiles had reared its ugly head. Unfortunately for Ludwig, the time was not yet right for him and his allies to wrestle a true liberal democracy out of the ruins of the Reich.\n\nIn this sense, the student protests had seemed a tragedy to him. Slavery, tyranny, state control; all valid causes to rally against, and ideals he sympathised with. This particular outburst at the obvious violence of the regime Erhard was forced to collaborate with and the slave uprisings shook the economic minister to his core. Behind his crassness, he had a heart. In front of his crassness, Erhard cringed at the economic stupidity of this Nazi institution and the untold prosperity it had denied Germany.\n\nFor now, Erhard did need to calm the students. Their violent responses, although understandable, were ultimately a hindrance to the obtaining of genuine reform in the Reich. His political invulnerability would be his weapon.\n\nCalls were made, and meetings arranged. Erhard had sent his sympathies out through the protests, spreading rumours that he, and others within the government, were allied with them in the struggle for reform. By dispelling this information secretly, Erhard was gambling on the news not being traced back to him, and that if it was, his importance to the Reich might guarantee immunity from punishment. In time, however, this regime and all it stood for would be erased."

speerescalation.11.t:0 "A New Deal"
speerescalation.11.desc:0 "Germania was called the Welthauptstadt for a reason. If Tokyo, sprawling metropolis of the isles to the East, was the capital of an Empire, then Germania in its size and magnificence was the capital of the world. The massive projects and renovations of old Berlin, and especially the expansion into a surrounding urban sprawl, gave the city plenty of hiding spots, however. The larger a house is, the harder it is to clean, and the dirty corners of the Reichs basement saw little light throughout the decades.\n\nHelmut entered an alley in a local downtown area of Germania's surrounding suburbs. He was dressed quite carefully in a black leather coat over a dark brown jumper. A fedora adorned his head and he wore dark eye glasses, not tinted enough to suggest sunglasses at midnight but not light enough to see his eyes. The outfit was a precautionary measure against the foreign minister being identified in the outer suburbs of his home city. \n\nTwo other men and a woman were already in the alley. They were young, and even in the cover of night, their clothes told their age. Effortful. Jazzy. American. Even as a liberal, Helmut grimaced at the sight.\n\n"Finally. What have you got for us, old man," the woman began. \n\n"Naught but a promise, I'm afraid," Helmut responded. "I cannot get you what you want now, but I can guarantee it comes in due time." \n\n"What kind of a deal is that?" The men tensed, an effort to threaten the aging statesman. \n\n"A deal you'll have to take, my dear, if you want anything done in this wretched country." Schmidt revealed a note from his pocket. "This is the address of a cache of weapons I redirected from some friends in the Heer. They're not for use in some violent rebellion; I want you to know I am on your side and will defend you from this police state I have found myself in. There's more where they come from, when the time comes, but for now I need you to lower tensions and engage in talks with the state. It is the only choice."\n\nThe woman grimaced, but nodded. "Thank you, Herr Schmidt.""
speerescalation.11.a:0 "All in due time."

speerescalation.13.t:0 "Wisdom"
speerescalation.13.desc:0 "Hegel, as a young man, described Napoleon entering the city of Jena as the 'world's soul on horseback'. The man was a hero, despite his crimes, and burned with the energy and charisma that galvanised his country behind him. It seemed to Hegel as if history itself had volunteered for his army. If the philosopher had been a young man today, a student on the sidelines of Frankfurt's protests, perhaps he would have had some similar esteem for the world soul arriving in an armoured car instead. \n\nVon Tresckow arrived in the city with the Orpo. He wore his military uniform that day, iron cross and all, with a furred coat over the top. An imperial elegance held to the Old Prussian. He had not come to fight, he had come to talk. \n\nOver the past few years, Von Tresckow had used his time to reform the police. Primarily, this involved reallocating resources away from weaponry, reducing their numbers, revising tactics and educational programs. Perceptions of Germany's Prussian tradition often confuse traditionalism and patriotism with militarism and dogmatism. Von Tresckow knew that the military and nation were central to a German identity, but they were a restrained force of honour and valor meant to protect freedom, not crush it. \n\nHe was to be an ambassador. Schmidt might have dealt well in foreign embassies, but Von Tresckow had always felt a bond with all common people. These protestors were no different. \n\nAs the Orpo began to form a wall around the students, they screamed in the officers face. This was an expected activity, and the police stood firm, but calm, as they had been trained to do. When Von Tresckow was spotted amongst their ranks, the face of Germany's security ministry became the target of even more verbal abuse. He understood their anger, and despite the protests of some of his own men, he stepped beyond the police barrier into the crowd. \n\n"Germans, gather round. I come not to make war, I come not to preach the Nazi ideal. I came to make peace, I came to listen to the people. So, brothers and sisters, speak." \n\nAnd so they did, until the final of the sun's rays died on the horizon."
