 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_ERICH_KOCH_DESC:0 "Once Gauleiter of the Nazi Party in Prussia, Erich Koch was assigned as Reichskommissar of Ukraine shortly after the occupation and quickly became renowned for his brutality, even by the standards of the Nazi regime. Koch has famously been quoted as saying, "If I meet a Ukrainian worthy of being seated at my table, I must have him shot." Under his leadership, Germanization continued well into the fifties until it was interrupted by the beginning of the West Russian War and the collapse of the Reichsmark.\n\nAfter the end of the War, affairs in Ukraine were marked by Koch turning upon his erstwhile sponsor Martin Bormann, who had previously supported him over Alfred Rosenberg to be appointed Reichskommissar during initial colonization efforts in the forties. The extremely public confrontation in the Reichstag led to Koch moving towards the militarist lobby that has rallied around Hermann Göring. The Reichskommissariat Ukraine teeters on a precipice: the native Ukrainians are beginning to sharpen their knives in preparation for the day when they can rise up against the Germans, the German settlers are growing unhappy with Ukraine's backwardness, and the situation abroad continues to grimly march towards utter calamity. Even Koch's iron fist may not be enough to suppress the chaos of the coming days..."
 POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_KUBIYOVYCH_DESC:0 "An age of oppression, barbarism, and bloodshed has crushed the will of many men and women to take a stand against foreign imperialism, and even fewer ordinary people would dare openly call for independence. However, Volodymyr Kubiyovych is not most people, as a lifetime as a soldier, a geographer, and a politician has shown. However, the many lifestyles of and bureaucracy surrounding Kubiyovych will not stand in the way of the one, true goal which has always persisted in the mind of the Polish-raised Ukranian, with the image of cheering Ukranians in a free state of their own.\n\nA life of study and teaching would not prepare the intellectual for the Nazi invasion of the Polish land he had lived in for most of his life, spurned by diaspora and, now, another invader of his home. Thus, Kubiyovych delved into the fire of his scorn to establish one of the few social programs on the face of Europe, helping thousands of Ukranian men, women, and children affected by the war. Meanwhile, the former cartographer chose to stand against the infamous Hans Frank in his desired slaughter of Ukranian peasants, allowing just a bit more success for his homeless people. However, as the Nazi victory came, all Kubiyovych could do was encourage the growth of the Galician Waffen-SS to use as a foundation for a pseudo-army to protect against further Nazi persecution.\n\nHowever, in the age of darkness Ukraine has found itself in, a light dawns on the horizon for Kubiyovych and his companions. Men may stand against him, clawing at him to strike down his attempts for independence. But such botherations and sins against the Ukranian people shall not stand against Kubiyovych's work with the Reich. Nothing will."
 POLITICS_PIETER_SCHELTE_HEEREMA_DESC:0 "Every decent family knows that you keep an extra bottle of your wine for when the situation absolutely demands it. For the German authority in Ukraine, Pieter Schelte Heerema is that extra bottle.\n\nA Dutchman from Amsterdam, Heerema was quick to collaborate with the Germans, joining the Waffen-SS in 1940. During his tenure, he helped establish and lead the Nederlandsche Oost Compagnie, which organized the Dutch settlement of the Reich's eastner territories during the war. It is through this channel that Heerema found himself in RK Ukraine by the war's end, helping in the administrative efforts of the colony.\n\nAfter the failure of the West Russian War, and the attempted SS coup in Germania, Heerema began to distance himself more and more from Himmler and the organization, while still officially retaining his SS title. Through his colonial and SS connections, he was able to ascend the ladder of the RK, all while managing to profit off of the 'rightful Germanization of the land'.\n\nNow that Ukraine, along with the rest of the Reich really, has gone into disrepair, the Reichstag has found a suitable safety candidate in Heerema. If he cannot improve conditions in the RK, he can at least keep them steady."

 UKR_breadbasket_of_the_reich:0 "라이히의 곡창지대"
 UKR_breadbasket_of_the_reich_desc:0 "독일이 동부전선에서 대승리를 거뒀을 때부터 우크라이나는 라이히와 팍트 동맹국들의 식량창고가 되었습니다. 농산물 수출이 정부 예산의 상당 부분을 차지하면서 우크라이나가 경제적으로 자급자족할수 있게 되었지만, 한편으로는 무역이 우리 산업의 발전을 방해해왔습니다.\n\n다른 경제분야의 다양성은 거의 없는 마당에 우크라이나는 식량수출에 극단적으로 의존하고 있으며, 농업 시장의 붕괴는 곧 국가판무관부의 붕괴로 이어질것입니다."
 UKR_partyzanschyna:0 "유격전"
 UKR_partyzanschyna_desc:0 "Even before the end of the Second World War, partisan groups of every ideology have run amuck throughout the countryside or lay hidden throughout our urban centers. The onset of the WRW has only emboldened local dissidents; guerilla warfare has since become an accepted way of life in rural regions.\n\nTo compound the issue, locals have taken action themselves. A broad alliance of local Ukrainians, including Horlis's Republicans and the left United Front, have banded together to exert limited political influence all throughout the colony. It has gotten to the point where Ukrainians hold the ancient title of 'Ataman' in some of the more fringe regions with little oversight. If order is not restored, the situation could deteriorate even further."
 UKR_shroud_of_generalplan_ost:0 "동방총계획의 장막"
 UKR_shroud_of_generalplan_ost_desc:0 "아무리 좋게 말한들, 동방총계획은 우크라이나에서 실패했습니다. 최초의 독일 정착민들 중에는 열성적인 퇴역군인들과 가족들을 포함하여 부와 땅을 찾아 풍요로운 평원으로 몰려든 네덜란드계와 북유럽계 기회주의자들도 있었습니다.\n\n당연하게도 무작정 독일인들을 이주시킨것은 우크라이나의 독일화가 실패한 결과를 낳았습니다. Our administrators were not ready to parcial out our new conquests, and next to no thought was given to the displaced natives or where they would be relocated to. Many wandered to the cities, which were not ready to deal with an influx of newcomers. The results have been catastrophic; natives live in what can only be described as squalid conditions, and the German settlers don't fare much better. With no capital to afford the trip back to Germany, the various settlers are stuck in Ukraine right alongside the natives. Only the urban-elite; the rich factory and land owners enjoy any luxuries, which further exacerbates tensions."
 UKR_land_of_contrasts:0 "대조되는 이들의 땅"
 UKR_land_of_contrasts_desc:0 "우크라이나 국가판무관부 정부는 깊이 분열되고 파벌화 되어 있습니다. 가장 영향력있는 파벌들인 독일 지배층, 우크라이나인 협력자, 그리고 독일 주둔군과 산업가들이 정부에서 지배권을 두고 경쟁하고 있습니다. 그리고 저 파벌들은 코흐의 통치에 대한 불만에 대해 뭔가를 공유하고 있습니다.\n\n지금은 분열되어있지만, 내부상황이 급격히 바뀐다면, 걱정해야할건 원주민뿐만이 아닐지도 모릅니다."
