 POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "The blood of Genghis Khan's Borjigin clan flows through Prince Demchugdongrub's veins, though one would not guess it from looking at him. Despite being a vocal Mongol nationalist, the prince has spent the majority of his life in service of foreign empires occupying Mongolian soil. His father was one of the twelve governing nobles of Inner Mongolia, a title that Demchugdongrub inherited as a child only from the generosity of his Qing overlords. When the Empire fell and the Republic rose, Demchugdongrub still answered to Beijing, just to Presidents instead of Emperors. The Republic of China proved disinterested in pan-Mongolian nationalism, so Demchugdongrub and his supporters reached out to the enemy of their enemy: Japan.\n\nAfter years of struggle, Demchugdongrub was able to unite Inner and Outer Mongolia under native rule once more. But it was a cruel mockery of his dreams, as he was a de jure vassal of the figurehead Emperor Puyi, thus making him a puppet of a puppet. He is despised by his people as a sellout and a traitor, and scorned by his puppetmasters as an upstart vassal with delusions of grandeur. This left him a wholly broken man, but Demchugdongrub has recently rediscovered a sense of purpose in putting down the anti-imperialist rebellion that took over Ulaanbaatar. Though that very well may be because he fears what will happen if the rebels capture him, or even worse, if he fails and the Japanese get him first."

 men.1.t:0 "Mengjiang Victorious!"
 men.1.d:0 "Prince De of Mengjiang has sent the Emperor his personal thanks for our aid in the recent disturbance, and assures us that order has been restored to the mongolian steppes.  It seems that despite the bandits early gains they did not have the discipline or momentum to overcome the prince and the remains of the rebellion is being rounded up as we speak.  Those Japanese which had fled Mengjiang are already starting to return, and Japanese business has begun to develop the nation once again as the last of the traitors and thieves are run out of Mengjiang and into the russian wilderness."
 men.1.a:0 "As it should be."

 men.2.t:0 "Mengjiang Defeated!"
 men.2.d:0 "Our military has predicted the final fall of Prince De for weeks now, and it seems that their predictions have finally come to pass.  A small entourage and bodyguard have accompanied De into Manchuria, the only remnants of what was once Mengjiang.  Once again the responsibility falls to Japan to lead Asia, as we must now decide how to respond to these usurpers.  Many elements in our government are calling for the reconquest of Mengjiang, claiming that it would be irresponsible of us to not return order to the stepps, and that standing down now would be little more than an admission of weakness.  Some however have become disgusted with the whole affair and desire to wash our hands of mongolia and of the failed Prince De in particular."
 men.2.a:0 "Order in Asia shall not fall."
 men.2.b:0 "We have no need for horses and grass."

 men.3.t:0 "The Fate of Mongolia"
 men.3.d:0 "After a decisive campaign our forces have triumphed once again in the steppes, and order has been restored to the Mongols once more.  As our spearheads withdraw and leave the garrison troops to their duty a question which has been brewing since the beginning of the conflict has finally come to the fore: what should be done with what was once Mengjiang?  Prince De has expressed shock and outrage at the very thought that his authority would not be restored in Mengjiang and many people had simply assumed that the old status quo would be reinforced.  However there are those who have lost faith in the Prince and claim that for De to return would merely mean repeating this war in ten years time. In the future, we might be forced to revist the "Mengjiang Situation" with an alternate appraoch."
 men.3.a:0 "The prince of the Mongols returns to his throne."
 
 men.4.t:0 "The Prince Triumphs!"
 men.4.d:0 "Today we have victory! The rebellion is at an end, and Mongolia is saved. Final mop up operations are ongoing and all extra Japanese aid withdrawing as order reasserts itself. Though in a land such as Mongolia the fighting never truly stops it remains clear that peace has returned at last: the sky's no longer thunder with the sound of bombs, the ground no longer shakes under the stamping of hooves. The Prince breaths easy and freely once more, and the Mongol people ride with him."
 men.4.a:0 "All is as it should be."
 
 men.5.t:0 "Our Rightful Domain"
 men.5.d:0 "Prince Demchugdongrub, in his great wisdom, has from the start envisioned a better, stronger, and united Mongolia. For this grand goal he has fought for decades, and the Mongol people stood by his side out of shared loyalty and just force. The lone exception and last remaining estranged Mongols are those living under the communist reds. In the west of Mongolia they lay, in defiance of their rightful ruler and spreading their filth. Even in our most recent battle our enemies were lead by a communist general. Now that we have finally united in true faith we can at last liberate the remaining Mongolians of the People's Revolutionary Council and complete the unification of our people."
 men.5.a:0 "This should have happened long ago."
 
 men.6.t:0 "The Ulaanbataar Rebellion"
 men.6.d:0 "The history of the Mongol Steppe has been one of constant conflict, and it provides to its people one simple lesson: Divided we are weak, united we are strong. From the earliest days of the Xiongnu confederation to the great Mongol empire of 1206, when the Mongolian clans are united they are unstoppable. But time and again we fall apart into petty infighting, and deliver ourselves as slaves to the Chinese. In the great war, aided by the great Japanese Empire Prince Demchugdongrub set out to unite his beloved people once again. In the footsteps of Modun Shanyu and Chinggis Khan he united his people under his name for the first time in centuries, earning his place in the great line of Mongol rulers. But not all have yet submitted.\n\nOur fair Mongolia greets this day a divided and bleeding people. In the previous weeks a treasonous coalition of bandits and communists swept through the Mongol steppes, catching our own armed forces off guard and once more dividing our people. With a combination of luck and trickery these vagrents have taken the momentum, even capturing our capital Urga, known to the reds as "Ulaanbataar". This shall not stand. The Mongol will never again fight his brother while being stabbed in the back by a Chinese dagger. Already our great Prince Demchugdongrub has called on every true Mongol to defend their nation and sovereign with the zeal of a thousand warriors. We will overcome these bandits and deliver Urga from their grasp, and the fools shall know the price of treason."
 men.6.a:0 "Rally to the Prince, crush the rebels!"
 
 men.7.t:0 "Japanese Bombs!"
 men.7.d:0 "Death and destruction in Ulaanbataar! The cowardly Japanese, knowing we lack proper anti-aircraft defenses, have begun a bombing campaign against our army and our people. Without opposition and devoid of honor Japanese have taken to terrorizing innocents and cowardly attacking warriors with no means to defend themselves. Knowing their own invulnerability Japanese jets swoop low over Ulaanbataar, dropping bombs and missiles upon our roads and buildings. Terrifying as they are to the common man much more has been accomplished by the massacring of our troops by bomb and bullet from the sky, cutting down horses and men with nowhere to hide or run on the vast Mongolian steppe. This is not war, not battle. This is shameful murder."
 men.7.a:0 "Cowards!"
 
 men.8.t:0 "A Quick War"
 men.8.d:0 "Our correspondence with Prince Demchugdongrub and reports from our own deployed pilots paint a rosy picture of the ongoing rebellion in Mongolia. Between modern air power, Mongol loyalists and our own material support the fate of the Mongol rebels is assured. Soon it seems we will once more be secure in the Mongol steppe, and peace restored in Asia."
 men.8.a:0 "As it should be."
 
 men.9.t:0 "The War Drags On"
 men.9.d:0 "Apparently, the situation in Mongolia has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage. The Prince has squandered our generous aid by failing to take back the initiative or pacifying the bandit rebels. As the war continues without any good end in sight our generals are starting to lose their patience with our Mongol allies. In any case it has become clear that our current policy must change, either ending the uprising ourselves or washing our hands of the matter."
 men.9.a:0 "We must take matters into our own hands."
 men.9.b:0 "Enough. We will not waste any more resources supporting these buffoons."
 
 men.10.t:0 "Training the Mongolian Army"
 men.10.d:0 ""Hey, Toyoda-kun, fuckin' hot day out isn't it?" said the young Mongol as he enters the Sergeant's tent.\n\n"Don't be stupid, Altan. And don't you fucking dare call me '-kun', I'm still your superior for fuck's sake!"\n\n"Alright, Toyoda-san" said Altan in his stilted, but clear enough Japanese.\n\nSergeant Major Hajime Toyoda had been reassigned as an advisor to the Mongol platoon two months ago, part of the first "observation regiments" that were deployed to Mengjiang. His job was simple - train the Mongols in accordance to the doctrines and traditions of the Imperial Japanese Army. Seems easy, he initially thought - until he actually had to train the soldiers.\n\nThe Mengjiang army was a hodgepodge of auxiliaries, former bandits and professional troops. Hardly any grunt was able to understand Japanese, let alone converse in it. The language barrier, as well as the extreme prejudice and contempt that the Japanese advisors held towards the Mongols made unit integration near-impossible, and Toyoda's unit was no different.\n\n"Look, Altan, don't get me wrong: I still think you're a useless little shit, but you're slightly a cut above the rest, and 'slightly above' is good enough for me."\n\n"So what's the point of you calling me?"\n\n"Well, I'm putting you in for squad leader - I've seen you fight against those rebels, and trust me - I know a good soldier when I see one. Not afraid to take on a machine-gun nest, not afraid to not take any prisoners."\n\nSergeant Toyoda walks out for a cigarette, and pats Altan on his shoulder on his way out. In solitude, Altan wonders if fighting fellow Mongols like himself was worth it - but to him, as myopic as it might be, joining the Japanese is his ticket up in life."
 men.10.a:0 "The rising sun still lords above all"
 
 men.11.t:0 "New Auxiliary Forces"
 men.11.d:0 "Our friends in the Imperial Japanese Army have released the first batch of Mongol trainees for service. Though they come back to us fewer in number they are far greater in fighting spirit, clearly not the same men as they were before. They boast of the harsh trials they endured and spare not even a thought for those who proved themselves weak. Standing at attention, disciplined to the last button on their uniform the Japanese have taken soft clay and fired it into the sword of the Emperor, and the Prince."

 men.12.t:0 "Mengjiang Requests Support"
 men.12.d:0 "Status Report 57A - North China Area Army (TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY)\n\nFOREWORD: Prince Demchugdongrub's forces of the Mongol United Autonomous Government  has been battling the forces of Yumyaagin Tsendebal's rebel government in the far steppes of Mongolia. Mongolia, while a backwater compared to the riches of Manchuria and China, is still a vital communications and logistics hub for transport through Beijing. As such, Prince Demchugdongrub's forces should be aided by the forces of the North China Area Army as much as possible. Colonel Kodohara, representing our Chief of Staff had come up with three proposals:\n\n(a.) The provision of air support from the 17th and 33rd Fighter Groups, as well as the bomber group of the Genzan Kokutai. The lowest possible commitment we can make, this would still mean significantly to the Prince's forces - intelligence reports have stated that the air capacities of Tsendebal's rebels are lacking.\n\n(b.) Same as option (a.), but with the additional provision of the 33rd Reserve Battalion - as an advisor group for the Prince's forces on the ground. This would increase the land capabilities of the Mengjiang Army - but might be seen as a waste of resources if the Prince loses the war in the steppe.\n\n(c.) Same as option (a.), but with the added provision of the 2nd Armoured Brigade. The heaviest commitment we are able to make, this would increase the Prince's chances of victory exponentially - at the cost of massively lost political capital if the Prince were to be defeated.\n\nSigned: Lieutenant General Ishihara Tadachi, GHQ Outer Mongolia Observatory Group."

 men.12.b:0 "Officers and equipment will be sent to train Mongol units, alongside our air support."
 men.12.c:0 "Provide training, air support, and an armored brigade."
 
 men.13.t:0 "Japan Sends Aid!"
 men.13.d:0 "Our pleas to the Japanese have not gone unheard, and today our Prince has received word that Japan will send us pilots, aircraft and other aerial support to aid us in our fight against the rebels. Doubtless this will be a great help to our forces as the enemy has no viable air defences, and the moral of our enemy must suffer in the face of airborne annihilation!"
 men.13.a:0 "We are grateful."
 
 men.14.t:0 "Japan Sends Aid!"
 men.14.d:0 "Our pleas to the Japanese emperor have not gone unheard, and today our Prince has received word that Japan will aid us with air support along with officers to train and equip our troops for battle. The twin fists of Japanese aerial bombardment and the famous fighting spirit of the Imperial Army will doubtless give our men the upperhand in battle."
 men.14.a:0 "We are grateful."
 
 men.15.t:0 "Japan Sends Aid!"
 men.15.d:0 "Our pleas to the Japanese have not gone unheard, and today our Prince received word that the Japanese were indeed generous to us. We can shortly expect not only Japanese air support and military advisors but even a full IJA armored brigade. The generals are practically giddy with the thought of not one but two Japanese forces which the enemy has no good response to joining the battle. This conflict must now surely turn in our favor."
 men.15.a:0 "We are most grateful."
 
 men.16.t:0 "The Ulaanbataar Rebellion"
 men.16.d:0 "Beyond the Home Islands and our more prized possessions in Asia, unrest has reared its head once more in the Mongol steppes. Our ally Prince Demchugdongrub had already failed once to keep the Mongols in line in the 1950's, and now he seems to have failed again. While we have not yet been compelled to become involved the conflict it seems likely we will once again need to support the Prince as Japanese citizens flee what was friendly territory only weeks ago."
 men.16.a:0 "Yet another uprising."
 men.16.a.t:0 "We will have to keep a close eye on this."
 
 men.17.t:0 "Air Raids Successful"
 men.17.d:0 "Lieutenant Asano swelters in the heat of the steppe, wiping his brow with his officer's cap. Mongolia was the last place he wanted to be assigned to: little prospect of career advancement, and a perennial war against an enemy that fades into the sand dunes of the desert. Today however, was a little different - his battalion was holding siege to a small town, stubbornly held by Tsendebaal's forces.\n\n"Hey Toru, when the hell's that air support coming in, huh? I'm fucking dying out here - Tsendebaal could fucking shoot me himself if he wan-."\n\nToru's stern stare shut the novice lieutenant up. While the ranks may not show it, Sergeant Toru Asajiro had been fighting in Mongolia for several months now, and has seen it all - from the flayed prisoners left by the notorious 42nd Kwantung Battalion, to Japanese and Mongols alike practically mummified in the desert, huddled around a small bucket of water.\n\n"Not gonna say anything huh!" says the Lieutenant as he picks up his rifle and ties his bandana around his forehead.\n\n"Asano-san, shut the fuck up."\n\nThe young officer doesn't heed the veteran's warnings and climbs out of the trench. The pangs of the desert heat have gotten into his head. The Mongol auxiliaries try to get Asano to retreat to safety, but to no avail.\n\nAt least, until the fighter-bombers swooped in low and knocked the delirious lieutenant flat on the sand. The last thing he saw before he passed out was a beautiful plume of orange, followed by an oppressively black cloud. As the lieutenant drifted off, he could barely hear the faint screamings of Mongolian soldiers burning in the distance."

 men.18.d:0 ""Suzume-1-A to Suzume-1-C, check your altitude, we're going down low"\n\n"Roger that Suzume-1-A, priming arms for attack run."\n\nThe bright, gleaming sun glances off the helicopter's cockpit and into the eyes of Captain Ito. For him, today's bombing run is merely another mission - whoever the targets may be. Civilian or military, the Outer Mongolia Area Army cannot take any chances - any potential resupply base for Tsendebaal's forces is a threat to the success of the campaign.\n\n"No resistance, eh Cap? They'd usually swarm us with ack-ack by now!" shouts Ito's (perhaps, overly) enthusiastic, door gunner.\n\n"Shut the fuck up, Takayama, just focus on hitting your targets."\n\nTakayama cocks back his light machine gun's bolt, and loads up high-explosive rounds. He's been on enough missions to know which missions involve "soft" targets and which involve "hard" targets. Today's mission is "soft" - so far. At least until several airburst rounds scattered around the helicopter - maybe this target isn't as "soft" as Suzume-1-A thought.\n\n"Bakayama, take out that fucking AA gun on the right! Everyone hang on, we're going in hot!" shouted Ito.\n\n"Suzume-1-A, Suzume-1-A! We took a hit! Going do-", as the helicopter next to Ito explodes in a beautiful orange plume.\n\n"Suzume-1-A to all Suzume-1 units, finish your runs, we're off for today. Good job Bakayama, scratch ten to your name when we get back!"\n\nIn their jubilance and adrenaline, the pilots of Suzume-1 barely just miss the column of bloodied and wounded refugees pouring out of the complex, shrouded by the black plumes of an ammunition dump's explosion."

While pursuing what they thought was a fleeing enemy a pair of what we can only assume were armored tanks hit them from the side. While many were killed in the initial blast the true mauling came when the foolhardy commander ordered a screaming charge on the new foe. Our horsemen were mowed down in scores and the shattered remnants fled for their lives, some of the more isolated among them not even knowing what kind of beast had attacked them. It seems a new foe has appeared, one to which we have few good responses."

 men.21.desc:0 "Despite our vast numerical superiority over the Mongolian rebels, we have been pushed back on all fronts, resulting in the collapse of our primary access to the Asian mainland and the sphere's industrial heart, Manchukuo.\n\nWhile their victory has cost the Mongols greatly, this massive blunder will go down in history as the most embarassing moment of the Imperial Japanese Army."
 men.21.a:0 "How the hell did this happen?"

 men.22.t:0 "The Steppe Situation"
 men.22.desc:0 "The Mongolian situation has become untenable, with the front ebbing back and forth in places and remaining static in others. While Prince Demchugdongrub has repeatedly assured our commanders that the Mengjiang Army will suffice for the operations in the steppe, and that "victory is within our grasp", his claims get less and less convincing with each passing day.\n\nThis presents us with a bubbling, but still manageable crisis, especially among the notoriously insubordinate Kwantung Army. Some of the more jingoistic and independent-minded officers want to directly drag Tokyo into the Mongolian rebellion, but this could lead to a dangerous precedence of wasting men, resources and materiel into small-scale conflicts that our proxies should be able to solve by themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the idea of direct intervention isn't that bad, as it gives us an opportunity to experiment with airborne and helicopter tactics in coordination with armoured and motorised thrusts - a doctrinal boost in an ever-modernising battlefield. In addition, it also gives some of our newly-graduated airmen a proving ground - the skies of Mongolia are vast, and there's little opposition to shoot them down.\n\nLastly, it will remind Prince Demchugdongrub to not get cocky in his internal affairs, and hopefully this would be the end of our massive investments in the Mongolian conflict."

The wise prince Demchugdongrub wills it and the Shо̄wa will grant his wishes.\n\nThats the official version of the story at least.

While morale and individual capability is another story altogether, we could tangibly aid them through the provision of (relatively) modern equipment in their battle against Tsendebaal's rebels in the plains.\n\nDue to postwar budget restrictions and balances, most wartime-era weapons have been kept in the IJA and IJN's stocks - mostly used as training, ceremonial and emergency stockpiles. Even then however, units on the mainland have more weapons than they need. Hence, our attache to the Mengjiang National Army has proposed the jettisoning of wartime-era Type 99 rifles, artillery pieces and the like to properly equip the Mengjiang National Army.\n\nFrom the sales, we could benefit from both increased funds for our state coffers as well as building the Mengjiang National Army into a proper fighting force instead of the untrained rabble they are now. While the equipment we will send may be outdated, setting up a baseline for its training into a proper counter-insurgency, anti-bandit force."

While this odd mix of competence and incompetence was sufficient for peacetime operations such as anti-bandit raids as well as basic garrisoning, this shall not suffice for an actual war, or a large-scale rebellion.\n\nWith the escalation of Tsendebaal's rebellion, it would be wise for us to pour in more trained and effective assets into the North China Area Army. Specifically, deploying motorised and airborne assets would be useful for us to intervene readily in the Mongolian steppes in case Prince De's government falls to Tsendebaal's forces. In any case, we should ready forward cadres of these units and send them to Mengjiang as soon as possible - to act as forward operating units, as well as advisors for the Mengjiang National Army.\n\nHopefully, with this deployment we can increase the fighting capabilities of the Prince's army - with luck, we can extend our influence far to the Northwest against the Russians."

As seen multiple times in the Great War and the Greater East Asian War, cavalry has faltered to the advent of artillery and machine guns......except in specific circumstances.\n\nIn the far-flung deserts of Mongolia and Western China, the horse has still kept its usefulness and importance in the harsh environment. Tsendebaal's horse cavalry and mounted infantry have proven to be scarily effective in wearing down the Mengjiang National Army, be it through hit-and-run raids or reconnaissance missions which lay traps for the Prince's army. Through our experience in Manchukuo and Gansu, elements of the North China Area Army have also proven themselves adept in cavalry tactics.\n\nIt would be wise for us to loan cavalry vedettes to the Prince's army, especially if they would be augmented by our superior airpower and electronics capabilities.

While previously deemed to be a necessary sacrifice in favour of concentrating our efforts in the Pacific and China proper, it has come to haunt us in the wake of Tsendebaal's rebellion.\n\nWhile an extra diversion of cavalry and horse transport units has made it easier for us to supply Prince De's forces in the field, we should focus on gaining an advantage over Tsendebaal's forces through our superior technological capabilities. Namely, extending the Kalgan rail network would do wonders to supplying Mengjiang's cities and towns, even beyond Kalgan itself. However, construction might be costly - considering the harshness of the terrain.\n\nWe can only hope that the Kalgan rail network's expansion would be a welcome addition to our ever-increasing investment in the Northeast, and would aid us in defeating Tsendebaal's rebellion even quicker - there are more pressing needs for our construction companies and resources."

 men.31.d:0 "Prince De's administration stands on a platform of Mongolian nationalism guided by the benevolent Japanese hand, but anyone who looks at Mengjiang for more than five seconds knows that the concept is built upon a throne of lies. While this approach would have worked in the 1930s, when our influence over Asia was still in flux, it has been nearly 30 years since the establishment of Mengjiang - and the Mongol populace has not remained idle.\n\nIt would be wise for us to realign our dealings with Prince De to unite the mixed loyalties of the princelings under his purview - as an anti-Bolshevik front upholding the noble traditions of the Mongol nation, though ostensibly still under the firm, guiding hand of the Japanese. With this in mind, the North China Area Army has proposed that an All-Mongolian Conference of Unity is to be held in Beijing - neutral, safe ground away from the front lines, with the idea of forming a pan-Mongolian, anti Bolshevik front against Tsendebaal's forces.\n\nThose in attendance would be the high-ranking commanders of the Kwantung Army and the North China Area Army, as well as the Minister of Finance, Kanemaru Shin. With luck, we would be able to unite the disparate Mongol princes of the northwest, and make a concrete effort to ensure Tsendebaal's rebellion does not threaten our supremacy in the steppes."

 men.32.d:0 "In the far northwest of our Empire, what was once a relatively quiet backwater has erupted into open rebellion. The Tsagaan Mongol Ulus, led by former Bolshevik Yumjagiin Tsendebaal, has seized control of the far west from Prince Demchugdongrub's Mengjiang National Army. While a minor rebellion at present, losing Mongolia would mean losing our reaches into the far north and Central Asia, as well as threatening supply lines and our positions in Northern China. Should the war not go in our favour however, the hawks in the Imperial Japanese Army would have a sufficient warchest to knock down the standing of our administration. \n\nThe Japanese have sent sorties of Kenpeitai Agents across the border to keep a watchful eye over the recently recovered lands of our Empire. They arrived in great trails of heavy-duty military vehicles chugging across the Mongolian frontiers, secluding themselves from the National Army's high command. They were here to 'handle' communist guerrillas behind the frontline whilst we focused on the enemy, we were told by Tokyo, but their sinister appearance signaled as if they were here for much more than partisans. Unloading truckloads of equipment and arms, the uniformed agents drew particular attention from our own men who were apprehensive of such an unsettling presence. \n\nTheir silence was foreboding, as it seemed they refused to speak to anyone other than who they were permitted to. We thank them and shake their hands for their service now, but with whispers and suspicion of ulterior motives, must remain aware of their praetorian position within our borders."

A people who were once lead by great Khans riding over the whole earth and making fools of the Chinese had become wretched vassals.
