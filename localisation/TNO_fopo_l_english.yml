The Americans will no doubt back the opposition, who has risen up in armed conflict to try to oust Machel and install their own dictator in its place, so it falls to us to protect the Machel regime and our interests in not only Mozambique, but all of Africa as well by extension, blunting the tip of the Yankee sphere in Africa in the process.\n\nDevastation is : [?ZZZ.gazaland_devastation]\n\nMin is : [?ZZZ.gazaland_devastation_exponential_min]\n\nMax is : [?ZZZ.gazaland_devastation_exponential_max]\nEvery 3 weeks devestation will increase by a number between the min and the max.

To the south: the great Atlantic, from which the OFN will arrive to defend its brothers-in-arms.\n\nThere is considerable domestic resistance to involving the USA in such a chaotic war, especially with the added complexity of a third side which is clearly not backed by our global enemies.

################### Madagascar
USA_madagascar_conflict:0 "When Emil Maurice, longtime Reichskommissar of German Madagascar approached us with an offer to defect, it was a chance we could not pass up. Admiral Moorer of the Indian Ocean Command quickly spearheaded the initiative to extract Maurice from his own crumbling fiefdom while laying the groundwork for the OFN presence to come on the island.\n\nOf course there was bound to be resistance. A faction of the garrison led by Field Marshal Erhard Milch, a known confidant of Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, has been ignoring Maurice's orders for some time now from their positions in the west of the island. Further complicating things is the group of natives led by Gabriel Ramanantsoa who have taken the opportunity to rebel in the north. While we had hoped to avoid violent confrontation with them, peaceful coexistence has proven impossible as they have refused to deal with us given our admittance of several members of the former administration into our United Coalition Government. We must therefore struggle against the German hardliners and native rebels both if we wish to establish a free Malagasy."
GER_madagascar_conflict:0 "All Hell has broken loose in Reichskommissariat Madagaskar with the traitor Emil Maurice fled and the natives in open revolt. Now only Milch and those loyal to him and the Reich remain to fend off the encroaching degeneracy. The Americans and Japanese have already begun to meddle in the affair, propping up the challenges to our control.\n\nThe OFN have established a proxy administration full of their own men and remnants of Maurice's administration. It seems the rot coming from the head infected the whole body. Meanwhile in the north of the island our onetime ally Japan is sponsoring natives led by the former collaborator Gabriel Ramanantsoa against both our garrison and the self-proclaimed OFN administration. We cannot allow Madagaskar to be the weak link that spoils our whole chain; we must rally our resources and restore order to the island!"
JAP_madagascar_conflict:0 "The collapse of the German Reich's only Indian Ocean holding came as a complete surprise - the planned defection of Reichskommissar Emil Maurice to the OFN had not even been known to us until our agents in the Kenpeitai discovered that he had already vanished. Surprise or no though, this is an opportunity we can ill afford to waste. The Indian Ocean is our rightful domain and the Germans have overstayed their welcome. The Americans too are over stepping in their blatant attempt to claim the island for their own hegemony.\n\nIt falls on us to sweep the island clear of unwanted foreign influences. Luckily a group of natives under Gabriel Ramanantsao have risen up in the north of the island to combat both the remaining garrison and the OFN puppets. While they wish to maintain their independence, we can appeal to them as friends of imperialized peoples of the world. We may not be able to project direct control in this fashion but we can gain an ally in close proximity to Africa while denying our rivals the eastward launching pad that they might use against us."

For the Pearl of the Orient secures not just our sea lanes to Indonesia but also our grand bulwark against the American leviathan. A loss now will leave our lands and seas exposed once more to Western intrusion; Heavens know what will happen from there.\n\nThankless and bloody our job may be, but it is necessary. Let's get to it."

Nevertheless, Japan's parting shot is as direct as it is profuse with irony: that the Empire would so easily surrender is laughable at best, and a lethal jape at worst. The real test begins soon, at the rare moment in a man's life where history repeats and legends are retold.\n\nSo rally the men, raise the palisades, man the guns - but above all, never lose hope.

  JAP_PHI_reconstruction_desc:0 "The failure of the Balintawak Blitz has brought us ever further into solidifying our position as the sole master of all of Asia. Though their rebellions have collapsed, the damage that they inflicted is here to stay, and is costing the Filipino government a fortune to clean up, which if they're not careful, could spell economic and societal disaster within the country.\n\nThus, we have elected that we will bring aid for our Filipino brothers in many shapes and forms, be it money, medical equipment, construction, or even weapons to clean up any remaining resistance fighters.\n\nHowever, we have been warned that the tension in the islands are very palpable, and that a failed reconstruction campaign may warrant §Runforeseen consequences§!. We must be weary."
  
  USA_USFIP_Fertig_reconstruction_desc:0 "Although the parties have died down and the beer taps have finally run dry, the Filipino people must still contend with the pains of a nation exhausted both in land and spirit. American aid in easing this process goes without saying.\n\nOur analysts estimate that we have no more than six months of leeway to fix the war's worst damages before public sentiment compels a withdrawal. By then authority should be restored to an elected civilian government, whether it is of Carlos P. Romulo's Commonwealth exiles or Carlos P. Garcia's "new Filipinos."\n\nNote that Mr. Romulo has staked his legitimacy on us delivering not merely reconstruction, but a timely, well-managed one at that. Should we exceed the six-month deadline, Mr. Garcia will likely succeed the late Sergio Osmeña, Sr. as President and establish a government less open to our suggestions than the "Filipino Franklin's.""
  USA_UPH_OFN_Mandate_reconstruction_desc:0 "With the general breakdown of civilian government in the Philippine Islands, Congress has authorized the Philippine Department to enforce martial law within the former Commonwealth's jurisdiction until order is fully restored and the bare minimum of economic activities may resume. General Beach pledged that martial law will last for no more than six months, after which the Mandate authorities will assume all government functions.\n\nFor the country today, insofar as it may still be one, is a hollow shell of what it was before the Blitz. Villages lay empty, the hollow wrecks of cities wail, and what few parcels of farmland that haven't been bombed, burned, or defoiled have been plucked of all they're worth by the bandits that rule the interior. Hope has fled for fairer climes; much as it pains us to say, the Filipino people will have to do without it for quite some time."
  USA_SPH_Coalition_reconstruction_desc:0 "In response to the 14th Army invasion, the USFIP and the Communist insurgency brokered an agreement which elevated their non-agression pact during the Blitz into a full-fledged alliance. Among its stipulations was a binding pledge to organize a post-war government composed of appointees from the Communist Party of the Philippines, the military and civilian halves of the USFIP, and miscellaneous groups opposed to the former KALIBAPI. Thus, the so-termed United Filipino Front evolved into the Coalition Government following the Evacuation.\n\nActing President Lorenzo Tañada's popularity can only preserve its precarious balance for so long before either Ramon Magsaysay's militarists or Luis Taruc's Communists grow too dissatisfied with their current arrangement. What happens in either case is anyone's guess, but it certainly won't be good for the country - or for us, after all we'd sunk into prying it off Japan."

From the tin mines of Malaya to the rubber plantations of North Borneo, our grip on the Sphere will be reforged, and our political hegemony in the region will be secured."

### Mengjiang Conflict 

JAP_mengjiang_conflict_desc:0 "Long after its destruction in the World War, the ghosts of the Soviet Union still haunt us.\n\nIn the far northwestern reach of our sphere of influence, a war yet rages. A faithful ally of Japan, Prince Demchugdongrub of Mengjiang, finds himself embroiled in a bitter conflict with a rebellion on his northern frontier. The so-called "Mongolian People's Front" is a puppet organization controlled by an exiled Red Army clique, and if they are allowed to succeed in their aims, it could start a chain destabilization of the entire Sphere. For obvious reasons, this cannot be allowed.\n\nHowever, we have faith in the Prince and his soldiers to be able to handle the situation, and for all the better. It is best that local troops handle what is ultimately a local crisis, but that does not mean we cannot send some aid and support their way in the form of guns, advice, and other equipment. With low-grade support like this, we can hopefully prevent the situation from spiralling so badly that it'd require a direct intervention.\n\nAll the same, we will do what we must."

### Iranian Civil War

JAP_ircw_category_desc:0 "Once one of the few allies belonging to Germany in the Middle East, Iran has recently imploded into civil war following the death of its Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a largely unpopular figure following his overthrowing of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and establishment of his pro-German regime. As the instability of the region has been threatening to boil over since the beginning of the Oil Crisis, it seems only natural that with the death of its leader, the partisans of Iran have made their move for power.\n\nAmong these rebels moving against the government of Iran are the Democratic Republic of Iran, led by Karim Sanjabi, the Socialist Federation of Iran under Iraj Eskanderi, and the Baluchi Liberation Front, an independence movement in the south of the nation led by Sher Mohammed Marri, among others. Of course, there is also the remnants of the pro-German government holed out of the north of the nation.\n\nAs fresh arms flow into the region, and the anti-German alliance already shows cracks, it would seem as though it's in the best interest of the world powers to send aid the way of their preferred candidates."

### SAF War - Aftermath

TNO_SAF_Aftermath_desc_USA:0 "We have won a great victory for democracy in South Africa, but our work is far from finished. While the German army is defeated, remnants of their forces still fight on. In addition, many local warlords have established their own forces, and would like nothing better than expel us from their lands. Victory in Africa means nothing if we cannot stabilize the continent.\n\nSome of our officers have suggested continuing our strategy of attrition, using overwhelming firepower and superior tactics to eliminate as many rebels that we can while minimizing our own losses. However, diplomatic officials have suggested using a softer touch to win over the natives, which they claim will stabilize the continent better in the long term. Whichever approach we take, the public demands that our young men return home soon, and leave a stable continent behind. If we fail to satisfy the public, we will surely suffer at the polls."

# Mano Campaign
USA_manu_campaign_desc: "West Africa has gone from crisis to outright disaster! It was bad enough to see the colors of the PALF, masking those of the Rising Sun, flying over the ruins of democratic nations we failed to defend. Now Japan's bloodthirsty stooges have taken advantage of the Oil Crisis to continue their 'liberation' efforts, striking at Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\nThese two nations, imperfect as they may be, are the OFN's only friends left in the region. The alternative to victory in this war is absolute Japanese dominance of West Africa and its vast resources. America will not stand by while slavery is reimposed upon Africans - defeat is not an option!"
JAP_manu_campaign_desc: "Our cohorts in anti-imperialism, the Pan-African Liberation Front, has excelled thus far in West Africa; their defeat of the 'Free' French, even backed by the OFN, proved the righteousness of our cause. Western avarice is no match for the armed wrath of the oppressed. Now, with the Oil Crisis raging, and the PALF relatively unaffected, they have seized the opportunity and struck at the last bastions of imperialism: Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\nBoth ourselves and the OFN are impacted by the Oil Crisis, but the Americans have still thrown what they can spare into the conflict. If the PALF fais now, West Africa will continue to be threatened by the colonialist boot - we cannot permit that. One last effort to dislodge the imperialists, and the region will be freed at last... and firmly within our sphere."
