## Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_HE_YINGQIN_DESC:0 "It is unfortunate that every day, He Yingqin's control of Guizhou seems to be coming closer to it's end. The military is already practically controlled by Yunnan and the economy is hanging on by a thread.\n\nMost had expected He Yingqin, as one of Chiang Kai-Shek's right hand mans, to take an important role in the governance of China, and his shrewdness only supported this. Of course, few expected the Sino-Japanese War, in all of its furious terror, to render the old KMT dead and Wang Jingwei ascendant, least of all Yingqin. After defecting in the last few days of the war, He Yingqins political reputation survived by the slimmest margin, and he lies on a razor's edge. \n\nNow the Chinese appointed governor of Guizhou, balancing minority and Han relations and attempting to steadily liberalize the country, He Yingqin has one worry that keep him up at night. Yunnan. "

GUZ_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As with so many other provinces in the new China, Guizhou had been overrun by the Japanese forces and handed over to Chinese administration. He Yingqin soon found that his only 'army' was little more than an extension of Yunnan's clique of officers. During the 1950's He chose to focus on domestic development and building up the people's confidence in government once again. At every turn however he confronted with monopolists, Yunnan officers and the peoples own memory of the KMT's many failures. By 1960 it seemed He had turned reclusive, seemingly overcome by the many failures both of himself and the KMT he had loved. However, in meetings behind closed doors and in He Yingqin's personal audience a bold reform plan has been developed. Perhaps there is still hope for democracy in China after all..."
