 BGR_Baldur_von_Schirach_hog:0 "발두어 폰 시라흐"
 GER_Baldur_von_Schirach_desc:0 "------------\n§L그의 동료 당원 동지들 대다수가 잔혹한 강도와 무미건조한 관료라는 평판을 유지한 것과는 달리 발두어 폰 시라흐는 그의 귀족적 유산을 숨기고 다닌 적이 없습니다. 그의 동지들의 연설은 자주 거칠고 박력있게 소리가 나지만 새 당수부장은 언제나 시적인 세련됨을 담아 그의 메시지를 전파합니다. 열정적인 예술의 후원자이자 열렬한 작가인 미국인 혼혈 폰시라흐는 유대인, 볼셰비키, 혹은 정치적 적들과 같은 이들이 유럽의 문화를 와해시키지 못하도록 보존하는 것이 라이히의 의무라고 생각합니다.\n\n18세의 건장한 청년으로 당에 가입한 폰시라흐는 히틀러 청년단의 지도자로 아리아인의 다음 세대의 마음과 몸을 형성하는 책임을 부여받는 위치까지 승진했습니다. 전쟁 동안 그는 히틀러의 총애에서 벗어났지만 빈의 대관구장과 청년교육위원으로 그의 영향력을 유지할 수는 있었습니다. 마르틴 보어만과 국가사회주의 독일 노동자당 보수파와 손잡는 정치적 모험-중상모략자들은 이를 순전히 기회주의라고 폄하하지만-으로 폰시라흐는 이제 라이히에서 두번째로 강한 사람이 되었습니다.§!"

 BGR_Wilhelm_Burgdorf_sec:0 "빌헬름 부르크도르프"
 GER_Wilhelm_Burgdorf_desc:0 "------------\n§L두 차례의 세계 대전과 서러시아 전쟁을 겪은 반백의 베테랑 빌헬름 부르크도르프 야전원수는 1915년 프로이센 군의 12척탄병 연대로 군 생활을 시작했습니다. 1930년대에는 히틀러의 수석 전속 부관이 되어 육군 계급이 상승하고 히틀러의 측근 자리까지 올랐습니다.\n\n어떤 장교들은 그들의 개인적인 생각을 숨기고 다니지만 부르크도르프는 자신의 사상을 감추지 않는 것으로 악명 높습니다. 그는 유대인, 가톨릭, 개혁파와 군국주의자들을 경멸하는 만큼이나 격렬하게 마르틴 보어만 총통과 국가 사회주의 국가를 지지합니다. 그러나 그가 그 무엇보다도 증오하는 것이 있으니 바로 패배주의입니다.§!"

 BGR_Walther_Hewel_for:0 "발터 헤벨"
 GER_Walther_Hewel_desc:0 "------------\n§실제와 가상의 적으로 둘러싸인 이 세계에서 라이히는 세계 무대에서 자신의 힘을 주장할 수 있는 정치인이 필요합니다. 무능한 요아힘 폰 리벤트로프의 몰락 이후 아돌프 히틀러는 그의 가까운 친구인 당당한 성격의 발터 헤벨을 신임 외무장관으로 임명했습니다. 전직 커피 판매원이었던 헤벨은 외무부에서의 고된 과정을 딛고 올라섰고 아인하이츠팍트에서 가장 중요한 외교관이 되었습니다.\n\n그의 떠들썩한 전임자와 달리 소심하고 온화한 성격의 헤벨은 국가사회주의 독일 노동자당의 확고하고 견실한 보수파로서 관료적인 경향에 빠져들었습니다. 그는 위대한 제국장관이 되는 데에 필수적인 활력있는 지성이나 독립성 따위는 부족하지만 총통 각하에 대한 충성만은 비할 자가 없습니다.§!"

 BGR_Kurt_Lange_eco:0 "쿠르트 랑게"
 GER_Kurt_Lange_desc:0 "------------\n§L쿠르트 랑게는 세 종류의 국가사회주의자가 있다고 생각합니다. 필요하면 거리에 피를 뿌릴 수도 있는 굵은 목의 폭력배, 울리는 목소리에 사람을 끌어당기는 성격의 카리스마있는 정치인, 그리고 쿠르트 랑게입니다.\n\n국가사회주의 독일 노동자당의 평범한 관료들은 적들을 토막내지도 못하고 극에 달한 연설 기술로 대중을 선동하지도 못하지만 그들의 존재 역시도 다른 이들 만큼이나 중요합니다. 쿠르트 랑게는 경제부 제4 과 과장이 되었을 때 새로운 은행 체계를 유지하기 위해 업무에 전념했습니다. 이제 그는 경제부장관이 되었고 국가사회주의 경제를 조용히 감시합니다. 동료인 다른 내각 각료들과는 달리 그에게 야망이란 먼 나라 이야기일 뿐입니다. 그는 그것보다는 총통, 국가사회주의 독일 노동자당 보수파, 그리고 그의 업무에 충성을 다할 뿐입니다.§!"

 GER_Gerhard_Klopfer_hog:0 "게르하르트 클로퍼"
 GER_Gerhard_Klopfer_desc:0 "------------\n§L게르하르트 클로퍼는 국가사회주의 독일 노동자당 내에서 장황한 직위를 가지고 있습니다. 당의 발령지도자, 당수부 차관, 마르틴 보어만의 개인 비서, 국가수상부장. 그리고 마침내 폰 시라흐의 음모가 몰락하자 클로퍼는 새로운 당수부장이자 총통의 2인자로 내정되었습니다.\n\n법률과 경제에 대한 전문지식을 활용해 국가사회주의 독일 노동자당에서 권력을 얻을 길을 세운 아첨가 클로퍼는 국가사회주의 관료의 화신과 같은 인물입니다. 교활하기는 하지만 야망에는 제한을 두고 있습니다. 강자 앞에서는 비굴해지지만 부하들에게의 명령은 단호합니다. 그는 온건하고 통제적인 분위기를 유지하지만 광적인 이데올로그이기도 합니다. 속임수와 기만의 때에 게르하르트 클로퍼는 보어만이 진정으로 신뢰할 수 있는 유일한 인물일 것입니다.§!"

 GER_Heinrich_Mueller_sec:0 "하인리히 뮐러"
 GER_Heinrich_Mueller_desc:0 "------------\n§L질서경찰의 수장 하인리히 뮐러는 언제나 정치적 불개입이라는 의문스러운 분위기를 두르고 있습니다. 제3 제국의 초창기 7년 동안 이 차갑고 계산적인 공무원은 뮌헨 정치경찰국장에서 게슈타포의 수장이 되었고 라이히의 비밀경찰들을 무자비와 효율로 지배해왔습니다.\n\n뮐러는 오랫동안 친위대 소속이었음에도 불구하고 빠르게 보어만과 국가사회주의 독일 노동자당 보수파의 편으로 갈아탔습니다.  그가 내심 정통적인 국가사회주의 경향을 지지하고 있었는지, 아니면 단순히 보어만이 가장 높은 안정을 제공해 줄 수 있을 것이라고 생각해서 그랬는지는 논쟁거리가 될 것입니다. 그러나 보어만에게는 이는 중요치 않습니다. 질서경찰의 수장이 뼛속까지 공무원이며 계속해서 독일국에 종사하고 있는 한 총통은 그가 그의 의무를 다하도록 신뢰할 것입니다.§!"

 #Foreign diplo
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_category:0 "Reclaiming the Pakt"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_category_desc:0 "With the Bügerkrieg finally fading away, Bormann's view is returning to the Einheitspakt and the Reichskommissariats - or what is left of them. Either way, once the word to begin is given, we will be able to assess and plan our response to what has been going on around us."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Bohemia:0 "Past the Sudeten"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Bohemia_desc:0 "Historically the first major foreign conquest of the Großgermanisches Reich, the region past the Sudeten was reformed into the Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren. Given the region's status as primarily 'Germanized', at least according to pre-Bürgerkrieg documents, its final integration into the Reich will surely be a quick & simple affair."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Netherlands:0 "Our Eyes in the North West"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Netherlands_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Niederlande has been under a state of Germanization under Arthur Seyss-Inquart for the last two decades. With the Reichskommissar's passing, the political situation has changed drastically. We must decide how to deal with our Dutch brethren."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Denmark:0 "The Northern Tip of Jutland"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Denmark_desc:0 "To the north of Germany rests the protectorate of Denmark, sleepy and content. With its generously bestowed - albeit limited - political autonomy, this nation has remained sensible and stable even in times of crisis, never straying away from its obligation of loyalty to the Reich. The Danish are a Germanic people, a fact evident if one were to visit its snowy lands and survey the men and women with their golden hair and azure eyes. The full integration of Denmark into the Reich, though inevitable, is likely years away... but when these efforts are fulfilled, it shall be a joyful day for all Aryan kind."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Crimea:0 "The Lion of Crimea"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Crimea_desc:0 "At the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg Großadmiral Dönitz, a genuine National Socialist and enthusiastic supporter of Führer Bormann, took the Kriegsmarine to Crimea so that it may be safeguarded from the monstrous claws of the Großgermanisches Reich's most loathsome traitors. With the Bürgerkrieg now over, we must give Dönitz a deserving hero's welcome back to the Fatherland."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ostland:0 "The Model Colony"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ostland_desc:0 "Once the 'Model Colony' of the Großgermanisches Reich, the traitors of the Ostfront shattered the Reichskommissariat at the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, with that dreadful conflict over, the Reich must once more assert itself over its rightful Lebensraum. Whomever now governs the region will either dutifully swear allegiance to the Führer or find themselves utterly annihilated, Ostland is rightfully the Reich's!"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Slovakia:0 "The Issue of Slovakia"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Slovakia_desc:0 "Having annexed the territory of Böhmen und Mähren, the Reich turns its monolithic gaze to the territory of Slovakia. Surrounded, with no friendly nations to back them up, and being simple to return back into the fold of the Pakt, we will issue them a concise ultimatum. They will either join, or we will smash open their pitiful army and march straight into Bratislava."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Poland:0 "Tensions in the Weichsel"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Poland_desc:0 "The Generalgouvernement, once thought to be a genuine success with regard to the process of Germanization, fell into chaos soon after the commencement of the Bürgerkrieg... a quite embarrassing example of our incomprehensible bureaucracy. The reformation of Poland poses a considerable threat to the Großgermanisches Reich, we cannot allow for their existence as an independent state to continue..."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Norway:0 "Fjords of the North"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Norway_desc:0 "The Danes & Norwegians (a perfect example of pure Germanic Aryanism) broke free of Germania's control at the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg. Given their strategic importance to the Reich, the Großgermanisches Reich has no choice but to attempt to reclaim these lost territories... this shouldn't be an issue though, the Nordics are pushovers!"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Sweden:0 "The Eagle and the Lion"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Sweden_desc:0 "The Swedish nation stands neutral in a continent dominated by the Reich's influence. Yet, this does not mean that the Reich and Sweden are upon poor terms. The Swedes understand the necessity of cooperation with the Reich, and in return the Reich is willing to bring them to the negotiation table.\n\nShould we bring the Swedes to the table, we may be able to extract from them far more value than our partnership currently provides. All we must do is reach out and let the talks begin."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Finland:0 "A Look to the Land of Lakes"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Finland_desc:0 "In the north our old and possibly former ally Finland has grown increasingly distant as our influence collapsed in the Civil War. Let's take a look at our old diplomatic relations and maybe more."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ukraine:0 "The Ukrainian Problem"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ukraine_desc:0 "Unfortunately the breadbasket of the Reich has not been spared the chaos of the civil war. We need to assess the situation in Reichskommissariat Ukraine and deal with whatever and whoever is in charge there."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Moskowien:0 "The Eastern Bulwark"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Moskowien_desc:0 "Though we had to make many choices and compromises, Moskowien was always our bulwark against the asiatic steppe. Now that bulwark doesn't seem so stable anymore. Action must be taken immediately!"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Kaukasien:0 "The Land of Fog"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Kaukasien_desc:0 "Kaukasien is... odd. Even before the late Hitler's unfortunate demise, little news but lots of oil came from there. Now with Bormann's firm hand, it is time to change this. Let's see what is actually happening in the Caucasus."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Italy_Fucked_Up:0 "A Minor Faux Pas"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Italy_Fucked_Up_desc:0 "It seems that our diplomatic attempts have not ended favorably for us. Many inside the Reich demand that the Führer take action, and the pressure is steadily increasing. Should we fail to address this issue in a meaningful way, powerful players inside the government may force our hand in order to get what they ask for..."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Mauritius_and_Reunion:0 "Die Eroberung des Paradieses"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Mauritius_and_Reunion_desc:0 "After the collapse of the continental German Afrika and loss of Madagaskar, we lost our only outposts in the Indian Ocean, letting the Japanese reign unopposed among the southern waters. However, the chaotic situation in Africa provides us with an opportunity to regain our presence in the region. The Kriegsmarine has been preparing to launch a swift attack against the hostile forces that occupy the islands of Mauritius and Réunion near Madagaskar.\n\nShould they succeed, we will be able to reestablish a base to withstand the Japanese aggression in the Indian Ocean."

The French State has requested that this rogue nation be dealt with and brought back into the fold. In the interest of maintaining the viability of the French state and the strength of the Einheitspakt, we ought to accept.\n\nA joint force of German and French troops will storm the small state, where we expect the Bretons will be swiftly overwhelmed and subdued.

Soon after Bormann decreed that the integration of the Danish must continue as before, a notion of ingenuity was raised by his Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs.

Many of such movies won't be very popular among numerous officials who are unhappy with the very idea of concessions to Japan, but it is up to our decision whether we can afford temporal setbacks for the sake of our long-term diplomatic interests."

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_open_to_zaibatsus_desc:0 "Opening our country to Zaibatsu has not been entirely harmful to the German businesses. Facing competition from the Oriental merchant families, the German companies have been encouraged to use their assets more effectively, improving our whole economy with their strenuous efforts.\n\nThe representatives of the German corporations, however, were less than impressed with the Japanese performance on the German markets. Having been maintaining their natural monopolies for years since the end of the Second World War, they are yearning for driving the Japanese out of their field of competition."

Our relationships with dependencies in Europe have been based on the idea of autarky and self-sufficiency, and excessive international trade can obstruct such order..."

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_invest_in_extraction_desc:0 "The diverse and stretching lands of Southeast Asia are abundant with natural resources that rarely could be seen in such quantity anywhere else in the world. Why not use it for our own avail if the Japanese themselves are willing to provide it on their conditions?\n\nBy investing in their mining sector and providing their workforce with necessary tools, we can extract raw resources of Asia for our own use while sharing part of our product with the Japanese companies."

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_open_to_zaibatsus_mission_desc:0 "As we have been expanding in the economic space of Asia, the Japanese expressed their discontent about one-sidedness of our recent agreements. To ratify the emerging inequalities, as they call it, the Japanese delegation sent us a request to grant permission for their Zaibatsu to act within the German territory. Representatives of each Japanese conglomerate agreed to operate within the limits of our trade restrictions as long as they are free to conduct business in Germany.\n\nSuch demand predictably caused discontent among the political and business elite alike, but at the same time, the hasty refusal can end our trade cooperation prematurely."

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_encourage_trade_mission_desc:0 "Not being merely satisfied with their presence in the German marketplaces, the Japanese delegation requested to lift some of trade restrictions towards the Japanese companies and provide moderate privileges for Zaibatsu on the German land.\n\nWhile we may not want to undermine our trade sovereignty within our own country in favor of Zaibatsu, we may want to consider this demand thoroughly if we want to keep good terms with the Japanese businesses for a time being."
 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_stop_spying_mission:0 "§RDemand:§! Reign in the HVA"
 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_stop_spying_mission_desc:0 "Though barbarian as they may be, the Japanese are not fools when it comes to internal security, as they took notice of our increased espionage efforts and utilized the Kempeitai forces to suppress our pursuits in the region.\n\nWith that in mind, the Japanese delegation asked to reduce the activities of the HVA in their dependent territories. There can be no question of surrendering our agency in Asia - but the straightforward refusal to the Japanese pleas can jeopardize our relationship even further."

Supremely loyal to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring and Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner's militarist clique, Drechsler's loud promulgation of jingoist rhetoric may further destabilize what little remains of the Reich's eastern territories as he makes true his various promises.

It's quite evident that we cannot hope to negotiate with Drechsler, given his stubbornness and clear mental deficiencies, therefore we should hope to match his insanity on the battlefield. Thus, we shall mobilize our armies and wait..."

We cannot and mustn't take that risk. Thus, through the enactment of 'loyalty checks', we shall prevent radicals from joining in on the campaign... much to the chagrin of many hawks."

Führer Bormann has decreed we mustn't hesitate on this matter, the Reich must act quickly to ensure the peace & security of the Ostfront.

Either, they shall subjugate themselves to Germania, or we may be forced to permanently dispose of the jingoist cabal governing Ostland.

However, now that there's a clear victor the task will be much harder. Any other victor in that damned war would have been better to deal with.

However, domestically, the many groups of the Reich have been up in arms. The Heer is asking to be mobilized immediately, as the slave plantations have begun to petition us to invade immediately.

It is with the idealists and dreamers that the trouble always starts. Andreas Meyer-Landrut is foremost among these men, believing that the dream of the entire Aryan nation is inferior to the pluralistic liberal nightmare he wishes to craft.\n\nThe Führer must make it clear what happens to those who hold their own personal vanity projects above the Reich's glory and continued survival. Now that he is in our custody, Meyer-Landrut will serve as a prime example. The only reward for uplifting the Untermenschen is the degradation of the Aryan race.

Many within the Heer still remember the Bürgerkrieg and remember our fight against Speer and his posse of liberal scum. Meyer-Landrut and his students are no different than that tratitorus architect!

Although (let us face it) those captured are Germans, they have technically acted in opposition to Hitler's Political Will & Testament, and therefore we can treat them as we desire.

Some good has come out of this at least; many of our citizens are blaming the reformist faction in our administration for this disaster, which does weaken their influence in our administration.

Operation Weserübung, while not the most successful of our campaigns that year, was still an unquestioned success, as the decadent Allies were quickly forced out, and the resources of Norway became ours. Not only that, but the Nordic people of Norway became the first of the Scandinavians to be incorporated into our Reich. Finally, the fjords and harbors of Norway gave the Reich the opportunity to gain naval superiority over the North Sea, a benefit which would become all too useful in the invasion of Britain. With all of these advantages, it was no wonder that the decision was made to remain in Norway when the war ended. Norway has remained one of our most important Reichskommissariats, watching over the north and protecting the Fatherland.\n\nAs of late, however, our grip over Norway has collapsed completely. Terboven, seeing the impossibility of his situation, left Norway with his men to fight in the Burgerkrieg- an honorable decision, but one that destroyed our authority in the region. Such a choice leaves our north open to western imperialism, as even now the Americans circle the waters of the North Sea, looking for an opportunity to expand their hold.\n\nLuckily, the Reich has once again found its footing under Führer Bormann, and we find ourselves with the opportunity to recover the fortress we have lost. Though this is unlikely to be an easy feat, nothing is too hard for the Reich. Soon, Norwegen will be ours again."

Much of Norway, as infuriating as it is, is against the return of the Reichskommissariat, making our deal harder. However, when the first ambassadors sailed across the Danish Straits, they landed to something decidedly unexpected- a band, Jonas Lie himself, and swastikas waving in the wind next to their Norwegian counterparts. Things only got better from there.\n\nAs it turned out, when Terboven left Norway, the NS- a collaborationist party that controlled much of Norwegian politics- immediately devolved into multiple cliques of politicians, each fighting for control. After a hard-fought struggle, Lie and his brand of radicals seized power and took the government. Incredibly enough, Lie is more in favor of Germany than the moderates of the NS ever were. We did not even need to ask about a Norwegian re-entry to the Pakt- they suggested it themselves!\n\nOf course, such a positive development is being spread heavily among official papers back home. Already, crowds read fluff stories about the Norwegian's loyalty and belief in the Aryan dream- a loyalty and belief so great that they remained true to the Fatherland, even in our moment of greatest weakness. Such a tale has gone over quite well in the Reich, and it seems that Norway's re-entry to the Pakt is only a matter of paperwork now. Who knew it would be this easy?"

In fact, it's becoming an opinion of many in the government that the Norwegians were more loyal to National Socialism than much of Germany itself.\n\nOf course, such blind faith in our system deserves some reward for their effort. It has become a topic of some discussion in Bormann's inner circle that Lie and his clique deserve, at the very least, a commendation of their bravery and loyalty.

While this certainly raises questions about the work ethic of our own government, these are unrelated to the current topic at hand- the forced agrarianism of Norwegen.\n\nDuring the occupation years, a policy of forced agrarianism was forced upon Norwegen, forcing them to dismantle their factories and ship them off to Germany. They would then replace them with farmland and other agricultural products. These policies, while giving Germany proper a boost in industrial output, severely weakened the already unstable economy of the Reichskommissariat. The reasoning behind this, as Hitler stated back in the day, was to limit what the Norwegians could do in case they ever had ideas of rebellion.\n\nOf course, Lie's victory has entirely disproven this fear, and now the need for a policy that kneecaps our most loyal subject seems entirely useless.

As much as we'd like to prevent this, of course, German assets are limited in these times. We only have a small amount of forces that we can spare to help keep order- not nearly enough to maintain our rule across the Baltic.\n\nOnce again, however, the ingenuity of Lie and his followers comes through as an easy solution. Lie and his government have bent the party's paramilitary- the Hirden- to their will, and they now serve as a loyal force, united behind the radicals. By reinforcing these men with both guns and advisors, we can bolster our presence across the waves without diverting a full division or two. It's another genius solution to what could have been a fatal problem- indeed, some in Germania now wonder why we didn't have Lie running the RK earlier, with how loyal he has proven to be."

Traditional holidays were replaced with German ones, celebrations of Germanic culture became commonplace, and the Lebensborn project was thrown into full force. Slowly but surely, the old traditions of Norway were replaced by the true, Germanic celebrations of Aryan supremacy.\n\nUnfortunately, Terboven's departure brought an abrupt end to these changes. Unbelievably, statues were torn down, swastikas ripped to shreds, and the traditions of the wayward Norwegian culture reared its head once more. While this disobedience undoubtedly deserves punishment, it has been decided that we shall simply restore those policies that have been lost. Once again, our loyal men in Oslo have proven to be a lifesaver- while they could not stop the reversal entirely, they certainly managed to contain the damage.

A power struggle ensued between the NS, the civilian party we had entrusted to run the nation for so long, as the wings of the party split from each other in an attempt to take control of Norway for themselves.\n\nIn the end, the Mainstream wing of the NS, led by Gulbrand Lunde, has maintained their control over the nation. While this may not be our best case scenario, it is certainly not the worst that could have happened- we have worked with Lunde before, and our goals line up in most areas.

However, Lunde crossed a line by asking for more autonomy from the Fatherland. To accept such a request, so soon after we saw the near calamity that almost engulfed Norway only months ago, is something we could not accept.\n\nOf course, not many in Norwegen agree with this decision.

In its place rises a new, collaborationist regime, one that manages itself but takes orders all the same.

Such an inefficient system will only lead to future troubles, and action must be taken to pre-empt these issues.\n\nAn attache will be sent to Oslo, in order to minimize the effort it takes for communication to commence between Germania and Oslo.

It is time to change that.\n\nWith a fresh new propaganda campaign, we shall emphasize how the Nordic people are as Aryan as the Germanic folk. "Separate, we are weak, but together, we are unstoppable!", as they say. Even now, design after design is rolling off the printing press, ready to be sent over the Baltic straight to Oslo. Perhaps we can never fully recover from the damage of Germanization, but we can certainly plaster the wound over with heaps upon heaps of posters and photographs.

They have been a constant annoyance, but were assumed to be on the decline as the years went by, until they made a sudden grab for power in the wake of Terboven's departure. Though our fellow Aryans in Norway repulsed this spasm, Milorg has seen a swell in both activity and numbers ever since. This cannot be allowed any longer.\n\nUsing joint German-Norwegian operations, we shall embark on the greatest anti-resistance campaign Norway has ever seen. Thousands of Wehrmacht soldiers will march through the countryside, rooting out decadence wherever they find it. No mountain will be left unchecked, no city untouched.

In Norway, Terboven recognized the hopelessness of his situation and decided to pre-empt the inevitable uprising by sending his men home, abandoning the northern fortress to the native inhabitants. A power struggle ensued between the NS, the civilian party we had entrusted to run the nation for so long, as the wings of the party split from each other in an attempt to take control of Norway for themselves\n\nFinally, the moderates of the NS, led by a Per Borten, managed to dethrone their more conservative counterparts, hold off a Milorg offensive, and seize power for themselves. Unfortunately for us, the Moderates are perhaps the least friendly faction in all of the NS to our return, wishing for both increased independence, liberalization of their society, and numerous other "reforms" that fly directly in the face of National Socialist ideology.\n\nHowever, this does not mean there is no hope for compromise.

They seem heavily displeased with the actions we have taken to drag them, kicking and screaming, into a modern-day Aryan paradise. Perhaps they just don't understand. In any case, however, a good amount of pressure and a healthy reminder of the European power dynamic would certainly be enough to at least bring them back into the Pakt, though negotiations would certainly need to be continued.

BOR_a_norwegian_force_desc:0 "One major sticking point that has cropped up in talks between Bormann and Borten is the status of the Norwegian Army. Before our untimely exit from the Northern Fortress, peacekeeping was almost entirely relegated to the German Garrison. This both gave us the ability to directly oversee operations against resistance groups and allowed us to keep a tight grip on the Norwegian people. However, in the wake of Terboven's exit, the Moderates have pulled a native defense force out of the people, which has been keeping things in check for the last months. After much debate, Bormann has directed that the Norwegians may keep their army, as well as allowing the average Norwegian to arm themselves in defense. After all, the NS clearly has control over the North, and the transfer to natives running the army allows us to consolidate resources that would otherwise need to be stretched all over the countryside. Besides, Norwegians are Nordic people, genetically close to the Aryan race. Why should we be running them as closely as we do with the Slavs and Africans? The solution is clear."

At least, that is what the general opinion of the Führer's office is, after a recent message from Oslo details a request for Norwegians to not only run their own defense, but have Norwegians arm themselves in defense against resistance forces! Such a proposal is laughable at best and downright insulting at worst- does he seriously believe that we would allow average citizens to bear arms? How many of these citizens would buy weapons to "defend themselves", only to turn around and sell them to Milorg or other decadent groups?\n\nOn the topic of native defense, it is yet another idea we cannot allow. Borten has proven to be a sometimes unwilling candidate, and he has caused trouble for us numerous times. Can such a man truly be trusted with his own army? It is of the opinion of Germania that a close eye must be kept on him, lest he try to break away from us in full. Were the Norwegians not wary of re-entering the Pakt? Surely we cannot be foolish enough to give them the means to escape us. No, we shall keep the leash tight on Norway until they learn that National Socialism is the way forward."

While this plan goes against much of what National Socialist ideology preaches, one cannot deny that it has some clear benefits- Norway's GDP is bound to improve, and the increased Norwegian production will be a boon to all of the Reich.\n\nFor these reasons, Führer Bormann has decided to accept such a proposal, despite the complaints of many of his counterparts. Besides the obvious economic improvements, allowing Norway some extra autonomy is bound to sweeten their opinion of us further, as we slowly shift the perspective of Germany in Norway from that of a conquering empire to that of a Aryan brother and protector, leading all of Europe into a glorious future. If some rules of National Socialism must be bent for this ideal to be furthered, so be it."

Such policy flies directly in the face of National Socialist doctrine at best and is downright treasonous at worst, but the kicker is the motive we suspect to be behind this action- Borten pretends that this is only for the good of Norway, but it's clear that this motion is meant to distance Norway from us economically, allowing them to slip away while we aren't looking!\n\nIf Borten truly believes that he can slide such treachery past us without us noticing, he'll be proven wrong. We shall twist Borten's attempt to break from us to our own ends, using his own desire to see his reforms through to tie Norway even closer to Germania. Trade with the Americans will be redirected to Germany, while industrial parts will be sourced from Siemens rather than the Steel Belt.

In the chaos, the worst case scenario happened- the Milorg, long thought to be on their last legs, found a final surge of enthusiasm and seized power. The northern fortress, long thought to be impregnable, has been captured by decadent capitalists who now aim a dagger directly at the heart of National Socialism.\n\nThough many in the highest positions of Germany have advocated for immediate military action, Führer Bormann has decided against such an immediate action. Instead, we shall hold a conference with the Norwegian government. After all, we are more than warmongering brutes- the Aryan is not just a warrior, but a scholar and a statesman as well. We shall come to the table and find peace for the Norwegian situation, as unlikely as a diplomatic solution may be.\n\nBesides, in the case that talks fall through, we shall certainly have bought time for any backup plans we may wish to have in place."

How can they actually convince the Norwegians, already high on the opiate of Western decadency, that partnership with the Germans is better? Worst of all, does Bormann truly even want this to succeed? The Führer is not well known for his love of capitalist nations, and his rather lackluster support of the conference seems to indicate a rather shaky interest in a peaceful solution. Is this whole conference just a ruse for whatever the Führer is planning?\n\nIn any case, the Norwegians are coming, and they're bringing briefcases and innumerable files.

Though the success of the conference is a surprise, it is certainly a welcome one for many- an invasion of Norway would certainly be a costly, long, and bloody affair.\n\nNone seem to be as surprised by the success of the conference as the Führer, who seems to have been fully expecting talks to fall apart. Forces on high alert have been stood down, pilots that had been readied for deployment now suddenly see the fuel take from their planes, and the Kriegsmarine's crews are dismissed from their ships after days of waiting. Most interestingly, numerous special agents have suddenly been recalled, their unknown mission suddenly cancelled. All of this demobilization seems to have deflated the militarists, who were similar to the Führer in their full expectation of a glorious new campaign for the Heer.\n\nThough the success of these talks may have been unexpected, both nations can cheer for a new era of relations between the Aryans of Germany and the Nordic people of Scandinavia, now ready to move forward in an era of unity."

The new dynamic between former master and subject has sent shockwaves through Europe, and the people of both nations now enjoy the cuisine, music, and culture that the other provides. A new era of European cooperation seems to be dawning, and the partnership between Germany and Norway seems to be the first step on the path to a unified, proud Europe.\n\nOf course, the differences between the two are still massive. Norway's western, democratic outlook sharply clashes with the National Socialist doctrine that pervades through the Reich. Their capitalistic, free-market approach to economics drives a similar wedge in between the two nations. Some among the higher echelons of the Reich's political machine question why we ever negotiated with a rebellious subject. Bormann has his reasons, of course. Publically, it's because the Aryan is an inherently diplomatic race- one that can compromise and treat with anyone. Privately, it's because the cost of invasion would be much higher than necessary. After all, why would you need to force an ideology on a nation when you can simply nudge their politics that way from within?"

Reasonable discussion turned into shouting, shouting turned to insults, and insults led to the Norwegian delegation leaving the conference with no treaty.\n\nOf course, this was entirely expected in the Reich. Plans drawn up in the case of a negotiation breakdown are already finding themselves activated, as soldiers mobilize across the Reich for what could be the first major naval invasion the Reich has done since Sea Lion. However, the military may not be necessary if all goes well. Our agents have been hard at work in the cities of the northern fortress, and perhaps we will see a favorable outcome without needing to get our hands dirty.\n\nIn any case, it seems that the odds of blood remaining unspilt are diminishing by the hour.

These men are the hardliners of the old regime, who were by far the most receptive to our rule. They were never able to hold the reins of the NS back in the Reichskommissariat days, but perhaps that can be changed.\n\nGuns, artillery, training, advisors- all are on their way to outfit our loyal fighters with the equipment necessary to overthrow the Norwegian government.

In any case, we have a major issue on our hands, and it falls upon the Führer to find a way out of this mess.\n\nMany have called for an escalation of the conflict- a polite way of calling for a full invasion- but we must consider what we really get out of this. Norway has proven that they will never submit to Aryan rule, even if it would benefit them immensely. They put up staunch resistance to our rule for 22 years.

The advancements that we struggled to place have been torn out in months, and Norway is once again a hive of Judeo-Bolshevism and degeneracy.

GER_BOR_OFN_Lifting_The_Curtain_desc:0 "When a good German citizen thinks of the American people, they think of a degenerate liberal population, enslaved as much by their own delusions of greatness as they are by their love of Jews and Bolsheviks. However, despite their innumerable shortcomings in almost every aspect, we share two things with the Americans: A desire not to let nuclear war ravage the planet, and a hatred for the racially inferior Empire of Japan.\n\nIt is because of these common causes that our wise Führer has decided to lessen the divide between the Reich and America. Foolish men may see this as a sign of weakness, but we know it instead as proof of National Socialism's inherent superiority. The Americans, seeing the strength that we hold, will take their place below us of their own volition. They only need a few little pushes in order to do so."
GER_BOR_OFN_Smile_For_The_Cameras_desc:0 "The American media is not kind to our Führer. After all, if they were to show a truthful portrayal of the Great German Reich, the dull American citizenry would be clambouring to immigrate to it! As such, the Americans portray Bormann as a monster, as they did Hitler before him. Before the Americans will accept any sort of deal with our nation, we need to show them that the Führer is not the inhumane murderer they have been brainwashed into believing he is.\n\nWe have arranged an interview between the Führer and an American journalist. We have, of course, set a few limits for what can and cannot be asked in this interview. This is not a means of deception, however, but a means of making sure that the American people get a true and thorough view of the Führer's character."
GER_BOR_OFN_Shift_The_Window_desc:0 "There are no boundaries to American hypocrisy. Proclaiming the ideals of freedom and democracy around the world, America has done everything to withhold the will of free nations of Europe to determine their own fate in the interests of the Aryan race. Crying crocodile tears over the oppressed Slavic nations, they do everything to submit countries in their own backyard. Their crimes against the Fatherland have not been left unnoticed, either. Where are the "freedom fighters" in Eastern Europe who did not fight with American weaponry and vehicles? Did the Arch-Traitor Speer not take his silver coins from the American departments?\n\nOne thing results from those facts: America is a dishonest political entity which speaks in lies and trickery and it is only fair that we act in retaliation against their perfidious machinations. To this end, we will assemble our secret services to conduct espionage work within the American territory. We will not instigate riots or anything of that sort - rather, we will use various forms of covert action to make America more interested in our partnership."
GER_BOR_OFN_Offer_Token_Concessions_desc:0 "Although our initial negotiations have started well and the American public in general was receptive to the beginning of the rapprochement, our efforts have not been enough to shift their attitude towards our geopolitical goals. The American diplomats insist on our concessions before they can start considering our demands.\n\nTo reassure the United States, can give them a small but significant gesture. Of course, we can't just give up our sovereignty and influence for every piece in Europe that is regarded as "occupied" or "disputed" by the American observers, but we can make small steps to show that we are as committed to world peace as they are. To show our interest in a mutually beneficial relationship, we can recognize Iceland as an independent state and revoke the Danish territorial dispute over the country. The Danes may not agree with this move, but their weight in the international relations is irrelevant to our bidding. Ceding the claims for a territory that was left out of our reach for more than two decades is more than a reasonable price for a more approachable behavior from our enemies."

Although his position demands a strong heart and indomitable will, even he can feel pity for the misguided race that has been dishonored by the Oriental barbarians. Surely, it was Führer Adolf Hitler who brought them victory at Pearl Harbor, but the Japanese atrocities in the Pacific were solely on their hands.\n\nIf there is something certain about the American society, it is that they loathe the Japanese more than us. We can manipulate their sentiments to get their public opinion of them on our side. Lamenting their national loss, we can remind them that they are not alone in their grief and that we, the Germans, know as no one else what it means to lose our national pride that was taken from us during after the Treaty of Versailles.

Perhaps one day they will call the Führer Martin the Peacemaker."

They may have hoped that the traitor Speer would come out on top, but now the dust has settled they will have to learn to deal with us - and we will have to deal with them.\n\nWe will send an invitation to a joint US-German conference, that we might establish cordial relations with our old enemy and show the world that we are not some monolithic state of monsters. Once this is accomplished, we can reorient our policy towards our true enemy in the East."
GER_BOR_OFN_Vanguard_Of_The_West_desc:0 "America and Germany will never be true allies - conflict with their bastard race, corrupted by Judeo-Bolshevism and the blood of Afrika is inevitable.

We cannot assert our own control, but we cannot risk perfidious Albion becoming an unsinkable aircraft carrier or an American barracks once more. We can at least extract promises from the Americans that they won't use the island like they did Iceland, as a Sword of Damocles hanging over Europe ready to annihilate us with the push of a button."
GER_BOR_OFN_The_Oriental_Concern_desc:0 "The Japanese Empire was an erstwhile ally of the Reich during the Second World War, and assisted our nation in the successful defeat and conquest of both liberal plutocracy and Bolshevik communism. Yet, our dalliance with the Japanese was always a marriage of convenience. They had their own reasons to come at odds with our mutual enemies, and there are enormous differences between both the government systems and ideological underpinnings of the German and Japanese states-not to mention our obvious racial superiority. As tensions with Tokyo over dominance of the Old World heighten, it is incumbent upon the Führer to find a new ally-of-the-day for the Reich.\n\nAs luck would have it, our old foes are in a fantastic position to provide such a role. The Americans hate the Japanese even more than they hate us, and the two have already nearly come to blows with the Hawaiian Missile Crisis. It would be wise for both of our governments to come to recognize Japan as a mutual enemy, and to coordinate our economic and military strategies to contain their power. As a side effect, bonding over shared abhorrence for all things Japanese might soften American perceptions of Germany more generally."
GER_BOR_OFN_Get_Orpo_To_Work_desc:0 "The American regime and its allies abroad are infamous for their widespread use of underhanded and deceptive tactics against their enemies. The CIA have no doubt stolen countless secrets and performed numerous acts of sabotage and disruption against the Reich. It is only fair that we return the favour.\n\nThe Opro will be deployed to the United States of America in great numbers, to infiltrate and sabotage American industry and political functioning en masse. Schematics will be stolen from American businesses, spies will be implanted in American intelligence networks, and our agents will turn over every stone they can find to discover information relating to American espionage efforts in the Reich. We will turn these Judeo-Plutocrats' conniving games against them, and let them witness for themselves the cleverness and slight of hand of the Aryan mind."
GER_BOR_OFN_Not_Quite_Loyal_desc:0 "Francis Parker Yockey is an intriguing figure. The darling of American fascists, Yockey represents the furthest right politician of any relevance in the United States, and though his perspective on race differs markedly from National Socialist orthodoxy, his heart is at least in the right place. A firebrand on foreign policy, Yockey is notably soft in his rhetoric against us, and would have all of the rage and hatred of the American patriot turned to the west, against the Japanese Empire and their occupation of American territory, rather than against the Reich in Europe. In lieu of an incumbent government willing to 'play ball' with Germania, as the Americans say, supporting the one man that we know surely would be friendly to the Reich seems a rational second option. Our friends in America will pay Yockey a visit, to make sure his sympathy for the Reich is sufficient to warrant our bankrolling of his career, and to discuss how our prospective assistance to America's favourite fascist might come about."
GER_BOR_OFN_Their_Part_of_The_Deal_desc:0 "Rapprochement with the Americans cannot and will not be a one-way street. Just as we are willing to make concessions for the benefit of our future relationship, so must the Yankees. The Reich has proven itself willing to respect American acquisitions in the North Atlantic and British Isles, and so must America respect Germany's acquisitions in mainland Europe. From the commencement of war in the 30's and to the present day, partisans across the Reich's European colonies have consistently had their acts of terrorism against the German order funded and equipped by American dollars and American weapons. If there is to be a detente between the President and the Führer, this abhorrent state of affairs must come to an end. Washington will claw back its insipid campaign for 'freedom' in Europe to diplomatic and symbolic gestures only-no more Slavic partisans with American guns."
GER_BOR_OFN_Support_Their_Claims_desc:0 "Any fondness that once existed between the German and Japanese people is dead and buried, but even our great antipathy for Japan is nothing compared to the frothing rage of the Americans. Permanent Japanese occupation of the so-called 'Treaty Ports' is a disgusting embarrassment for the United States, and their return is easily the highest priority foreign policy objective for any American president. Owing to this, the White House will surely be most grateful for the number one global superpower to come to their aid and offer its sincerest support to rectify this terrible crime.\n\nHenceforth, the Greater German Reich shall officially recognize American sovereignty over the ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles. These great American cities have had their access to the Pacific carved away from them by untermenschen Asian aggressors for far too long, and the world ought to know that Germany stands behind their rightful return to American civilian and military control, 100%."
GER_BOR_OFN_In_Their_Backyard_desc:0 "America is not enough. Though it is the economic, military and political lynchpin of the OFN, containing the Orpo's overseas activities to American soil limits their effectiveness at inducing outcomes positive to the Reich and the German people. Are not the greedy industrialists of Canada and the corrupt security apparatuses of Mexico equally as susceptible to our espionage as any American businessman or politician might be? So why limit ourselves? We can even use the American's allies against them, implanting agents and forging documents from less secure jurisdictions, that we can then use to gather American intelligence under the guise of information sharing with allied partners. Let us make America's backyard a minefield of subterfuge, that they might find no friends with which to safely share their secrets."
GER_BOR_OFN_But_The_Best_Weve_Got_desc:0 "Our agents have returned from their meetings with Yockey, and their reception was mixed. The man seems to have no great love for any nation but his own, and nearly had one of our attaches reported to the police, his reticence no doubt motivated in part by a desire to avoid a headline on tomorrow's paper with 'Yockey' and 'Nazi spy' in the same sentence. A sane concern, obviously, but still a disappointing one for us.\n\nNevertheless, some of Yockey's underlings and financiers contacted our representatives after talks with the man himself failed to pan out. They're willing to take our money, laundered as donations from American businessmen, without Yockey ever having to personally know about the scheme. It seems Yockey is not quite loyal to Germania, but he's still the best chance we've got. For all of his "America First" rhetoric, he would still be far friendlier to the German Reich than any other man in American politics. Every million dollars we funnel him will be a million well spent."
GER_BOR_OFN_Only_Bormann_Can_Go_To_America_desc:0 "Relations with the Americans are improving measurably month by month, and the President has made numerous actions and statements conciliatory to Germany and to the Führer. One great obstacle still remains to the business of calling our relationship with the Americans fully repaired, however: that of an in-person meeting. All of the discussions so far between President and Führer have been through proxies, and Herr Bormann's feet on American soil would forever cement the great strides in cooperation and understanding made between the two titans of the Atlantic. Imagine it: the Führer of Germany, shaking hands and smiling in the Oval Office with the President of the United States. Could any sight be more striking?"
GER_BOR_OFN_The_Curtain_Closed_desc:0 "Rapprochement with the United States of America is impossible. Barring unforeseen unrest and political change in the United States, the Reich cannot and will never be able to make peace with the Land of the Free. Perhaps our two nations' mutual animosity is for the best? A positive relationship with the Americans would surely bolster their incessant cultural corruption of our youth, and further the cause of the 'reform' movement inside the Reich. Maybe, it is best for Germany to keep its curtains closed, lest stranger's eyes peer inside our home and plot their nefarious plans against the German people. We can surely find a positive way to spin it. Führer Bormann making a stand against the American plutocracy, perhaps; our reasonable attempts at diplomacy rebuffed by a prideful old world power in decline; the Jewry of North America predictably sabotaging the proceedings. Whatever explanations we give, the German people at large will accept them, and hail the Führer both for his wise attempt to make friends with the United States, and for his brave refusal to ultimately do so."
