 BGR_Baldur_von_Schirach_hog:0 "Baldur von Schirach"
 GER_Baldur_von_Schirach_desc:0 "------------\nWhile most of his fellow Party comrades maintain the reputation of brutal thugs and bland bureaucrats, Baldur von Schirach has never shied away from his aristocratic heritage. The speeches of his comrades are often guttural and punchy, but the new Chief of the Party Chancellery has always delivered his messages with a poetic flair. A keen patron of the arts and an avid author, the half-American von Schirach believes it is the duty of the Reich to protect European culture from those who would subvert it - be they Jews, Bolsheviks... or political rivals.\n\nJoining the Party as a strapping young lad of eighteen, von Schirach rose through the ranks to become the Leader of the Hitler Youth and the man responsible for shaping the minds and bodies of the next Aryan generation. Though he fell out of favor with Hitler during the War, he maintained his sphere of influence as the Gauleiter of Vienna and the Reichsleiter for Youth Education. Having aligned himself with Martin Bormann and the powerful Conservative faction of the NSDAP - a political maneuver his detractors have dismissed as mere opportunism - von Schirach now finds himself as the second-most powerful man in the Reich."

 BGR_Wilhelm_Burgdorf_sec:0 "Wilhelm Burgdorf"
 GER_Wilhelm_Burgdorf_desc:0 "------------\nA grizzled veteran of both World Wars and the West Russian War, Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Burgdorf has been a military man since he was assigned to the Prussian Army's Grenadier Regiment 12 in 1915. The 1930s saw him leaping up the ranks of the Wehrmacht and into the inner circle of Adolf Hitler, who Burgdorf served as Chief Adjutant.\n\nWhile some military officers keep their private thoughts to themselves, Burgdorf is notorious for wearing his heart on his sleeve. He supports the Führer Martin Bormann and the National Socialist state as virulently as he despises Jews, Catholics, Reformists and Militarists. If there is one thing he hates above all, however, it is defeatism."

 BGR_Walther_Hewel_for:0 "Walther Hewel"
 GER_Walther_Hewel_desc:0 "------------\nIn a world of foes both real and imagined, the Reich needs a politician capable of asserting its strength on the world stage. After the downfall of the incompetent Joachim von Ribbentrop, Adolf Hitler appointed his close friend and confidante Walther Hewel as the new Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs. A former coffee salesman, Hewel has scaled the greasy ladder of the Foreign Ministry to become the most important diplomat in the Einheitspakt.\n\nUnlike his boisterous predecessor, the shy and good-natured Hewel has sunk into the bureaucratic background as a tenacious and steadfast Conservative of the NSDAP. While he lacks the dynamic intelligence and independence necessary for being a great Reichsminister, his loyalty to the Führer is unmatched."

 BGR_Kurt_Lange_eco:0 "Kurt Lange"
 GER_Kurt_Lange_desc:0 "------------\nKurt Lange believes that there are three types of National Socialists: There are the thick-necked thugs who spill blood in the streets when necessary; there are the charismatic politicians with booming voices and magnetic personalities; and finally, there is Kurt Lange.\n\nThough the bland bureaucrats of the NSDAP cannot beat their enemies to a pulp, or manipulate the masses with masterful oratory skills, their presence in the government is just as important. When Kurt Lange was the Head of Department IV in the Reichsministry of Economics, he dutifully stuck to his work in maintaining the new banking system; now as its Reichsminister, he silently oversees the National Socialist economy. Unlike most of his fellow Cabinet members, ambition is foreign to him. Above himself, he is loyal to the Führer, the NSDAP Conservatives - and his work."

 GER_Gerhard_Klopfer_hog:0 "Gerhard Klopfer"
 GER_Gerhard_Klopfer_desc:0 "------------\nGerhard Klopfer has owned a litany of titles within the NSDAP. Befehlsleiter of the Party. State Secretary of the Party Chancellery. Private Secretary to Martin Bormann. Chief of the Reich Chancellery. At long last, after the collapse of von Schirach's conspiracy, Klopfer has been named as the new Chief of the Party Chancellery and second-in-command to the Führer himself.\n\nThe fawning Klopfer, who has utilized his expertise in law and economics to forge a path to power through the NSDAP, is the personification of the National Socialist bureaucrat: Though cunning, his ambition has a sensible limit; though cowardly before superiors, his command of his underlings is absolute; though he maintains an air of moderation and restraint, he is a rabid ideologue. In times of conspiracy and deceit, Gerhard Klopfer may be the only man Bormann can truly trust."

 GER_Heinrich_Mueller_sec:0 "Heinrich Müller"
 GER_Heinrich_Mueller_desc:0 "------------\nThe Chief of the Ordnunspolzei, Heinrich Müller, has always surrounded himself in a mysterious air of apoliticism. Within seven years of the Third Reich's birth, this cold and calculating officer had evolved from Head of the Munich Political Police Department to Chief of the Gestapo, controlling the secret police of the Reich with ruthless efficiency.\n\nDespite being a longtime member of the SS, Müller was quick to side with Bormann and the Conservative wing of the NSDAP. Whether he quietly aligns with the tenets of orthodox National Socialism, or simply considered Bormann to provide the most stability, is a matter of contention. For Bormann, it matters not. As long as the OrPo Chief remains a tenacious functionary and continues to serve the German state, the Führer will trust him to fulfil his duty."

 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Bohemia_desc:0 "Historically the first major foreign conquest of the Großgermanisches Reich, the region past the Sudeten was reformed into the Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren. Given the region's status as primarily 'Germanized', at least according to pre-Bürgerkrieg documents, its final integration into the Reich will surely be a quick & simple affair."

 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Denmark_desc:0 "To the north of Germany rests the protectorate of Denmark, sleepy and content. With its generously bestowed - albeit limited - political autonomy, this nation has remained sensible and stable even in times of crisis, never straying away from its obligation of loyalty to the Reich. The Danish are a Germanic people, a fact evident if one were to visit its snowy lands and survey the men and women with their golden hair and azure eyes.

Many of such movies won't be very popular among numerous officials who are unhappy with the very idea of concessions to Japan, but it is up to our decision whether we can afford temporal setbacks for the sake of our long-term diplomatic interests."

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_open_to_zaibatsus_desc:0 "Opening our country to Zaibatsu has not been entirely harmful to the German businesses. Facing competition from the Oriental merchant families, the German companies have been encouraged to use their assets more effectively, improving our whole economy with their strenuous efforts.\n\nThe representatives of the German corporations, however, were less than impressed with the Japanese performance on the German markets. Having been maintaining their natural monopolies for years since the end of the Second World War, they are yearning for driving the Japanese out of their field of competition."

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_encourage_trade_desc:0 "Between the flow of Japanese goods into the Reich and the exploitation of the frontiers of China and the East Indies by the German businessmen, the promises of furthering the inter-bloc business between the Pakt and the Sphere look very appealing.\n\nHowever, it should be taken into account that expanding trade with Japan and her sphere can weaken our Großraum Kontinentaleuropa program.

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_open_to_zaibatsus_mission_desc:0 "As we have been expanding in the economic space of Asia, the Japanese expressed their discontent about one-sidedness of our recent agreements. To ratify the emerging inequalities, as they call it, the Japanese delegation sent us a request to grant permission for their Zaibatsu to act within the German territory. Representatives of each Japanese conglomerate agreed to operate within the limits of our trade restrictions as long as they are free to conduct business in Germany.\n\nSuch demand predictably caused discontent among the political and business elite alike, but at the same time, the hasty refusal can end our trade cooperation prematurely."

 GER_Bormann_Sphere_Trade_stop_spying_mission_desc:0 "Though barbarian as they may be, the Japanese are not fools when it comes to internal security, as they took notice of our increased espionage efforts and utilized the Kempeitai forces to suppress our pursuits in the region.\n\nWith that in mind, the Japanese delegation asked to reduce the activities of the HVA in their dependent territories. There can be no question of surrendering our agency in Asia - but the straightforward refusal to the Japanese pleas can jeopardize our relationship even further."

 BOR_der_burgerkrieg:0 "Der Bürgerkreig"
 BOR_der_burgerkrieg_desc:0 "It has begun. What many Germans have suspected and been dreading has finally happened; the German Civil War has finally broken out!\n\nThe Reich is beset by traitors and usurpers on all sides. The madness of Heydrich, the decadence of Speer nor the unrefined methods of Göring are not the futures that Germany needs nor deserves. Only Martin Bormann truly represents the values of National Socialism that have brought the Reich to greatness in the first place. We shall show this truth to the people, to Europe and to the world. When Bormann's loyalists have crushed all traitors to the Reich will the security of our people be secured. We will once again create a society that WILL stand the test of time, and it will live for a thousand years forevermore."
 BOR_the_faith_of_the_people:0 "The Faith of the People"
 BOR_the_faith_of_the_people_desc:0 "Despite the Propaganda of our enemies, Bormann's support is genuine and wide. For example, this letter from a Munich housewife here or this one from a farmer near Vienna. Letters, gifts and other signs of support arrive daily at the HQ. Let's cite them in every speech, in every newspaper, in every TV spot: the People have faith in us and us only."
 BOR_the_peoples_champion:0 "The People's Champion"
 BOR_the_peoples_champion_desc:0 "All across the Reich those that see Bormann for what he is: Not the pursuer of narrow militarist self-interest like Göring nor corrupted youth like Speer or even the occultist madness of Heydrich. No, Bormann's support lies across all swathes and classes of Germany from the workers to the bosses, from the rural folk to the city dwellers, from the old aristocracy to the dynamic party leaders and from Austria to the North Sea. Truly a man of the people, isn't he?"
 BOR_rally_the_fatherland:0 "Rally the Fatherland"
 BOR_rally_the_fatherland_desc:0 "There's a sound that echoes from east to west. He who can hear hears;\n\nThe sound that no one can rest from, To whom Germany swears allegiance;\n\n110 million, one Führer. Let those who wish deny it.\n\nIn the harmony of hearts, lies the will and the power.\n\nThe people are immortal, that achieve unity.\n\nGermany for you the day has come, Germany for you the day has come.\n\n110 million, one Führer.\n\n-Bormannite pamphlet"
 BOR_full_political_mobilization:0 "Full Political Mobilization"
 BOR_full_political_mobilization_desc:0 "With the Civil War starting to gather steam in intensity, a mobilization of the people, the industry and administration is happening. But that is not enough if victory is to be ensured. For Bormann to reclaim his position as Hitler's true successor there has to be a political mobilization as well. From every level of government, to celebrities, propaganda departments, associations and many many more, a full political mobilization will take place. Everyone shall know that Bormann has support far larger and broader than his adversaries."
 BOR_promise_the_calm:0 "Promise the Calm"
 BOR_promise_the_calm_desc:0 "The German people may be a strong, skilled and warlike people; but they are also a people that value Law and Order. With a Civil War going on we are obviously as far away from that as possible. However, the promise to return to the stability needed can be a powerful one indeed, and Bormann shall make that promise in every speech and pamphlet: calm has a name and it is Bormann."
 BOR_fight_for_the_calm:0 "Fight for the Calm"
 BOR_fight_for_the_calm_desc:0 "There can be no doubt that if law and order is ever to return it has to be through Führer Bormann. He is our first and last hope from Speerian degeneracy, SS madness and Goeringite corruption, this has to be made clear to everyone in the Reich. With the parts of the propaganda ministry still under control, posters with Bormann's portrait shall line the streets, radio spots and TV shows will praise him daily and all throughout society. But that is not enough, for the common soldier has to be instilled that he is fighting for the calm that Bormann will bring."
 BOR_fight_for_the_peace:0 "Fight for the Peace"
 BOR_fight_for_the_peace_desc:0 "Though permanent peace makes weak and decadent according to National Socialist thought, peace among those who make up the foundations of the Reich is a necessity. The faster this conflict ends, the faster the Reich can be brought back to a peace that will rebuild the damages already done. This has to be made clear to all units who fight: The harder they fight the earlier they can go home and serve the Reich and Führer Bormann in another way."
 BOR_great_friends_in_high_places:0 "Great Friends in High Places"
 BOR_great_friends_in_high_places_desc:0 "Wittelsbach, Hohenzollern, Welfe and even Habsburg. The old Aristocracy's influence may have faded, but it is still there and so is their old money, their holdings and their titles. Bormann has the means and the influence to draw upon these connections. A few dinners here, some clandestine meetings there. Promises, bribes, threats if necessary and the leaders of old will help ahead the Führer of new."
 BOR_keep_your_friends_close:0 "Keep Your Friends Close..."
 BOR_keep_your_friends_close_desc:0 "The support network that has been built by Bormann over the years is vast. And that is proving itself a handy tool during the days of Civil War. Yet that size also brings with it some problems: Among the number of our supporters are also those found wavering, lazy incompetent or even worse: hidden traitors. Loyalty and trust are good and well, but we shall keep an eye on our various "friends", just in case. And an eye on the watchmen too. The Führer's orders are clear, to take no chances."
 BOR_and_their_friends_closer:0 "...And Their Friends Closer"
 BOR_and_their_friends_closer_desc:0 "One would think that among four warring contenders and the so called guardians of Germania, every person of noticeable influence in the Reich has already picked sides. However this isn't so even among the area controlled by our forces. Bormann of course can't just ignore these potential resources at best and potential traitors at worst. Through his manifold personal connections he will begin to pull some strings and bring these individuals to his side. ...With some precautions of course."
 BOR_the_faith_of_our_leaders:0 "The Faith of our Leaders"
 BOR_the_faith_of_our_leaders_desc:0 "From the old Aristocrats and Junkers with their grand old estates, to the generals and officers of the second Weltkrieg as well as the old fighters from before our rise to power, they all have one thing in common: their Faith in Bormann is strong and this Faith will be the foundation upon which Germany will be made great again. By mobilizing their support whenever necessary, we can get the edge in the civil War we need. We will reward their faith once this is situation is all won and done."
 BOR_friends_in_the_banks:0 "Friends in the Banks"
 BOR_friends_in_the_banks_desc:0 "From Deutsche Bank to Commerzbank and from Dresdner Bank to the Reichsbank itself, Bormann's influence reaches far and wide. Just as aryan entrepreneurs lent a hand to the late Hitler's rise decades ago, so will they help in letting Bormann claim his rightful position. But even beyond voluntary donations, we can use a few tricks to secure loans with favourable conditions. By promising privatizations, lucrative rebuilding deals and tax cuts after the end of the civil war we should get even more help for our cause."
 BOR_we_have_the_money:0 "We Have The Money"
 BOR_we_have_the_money_desc:0 "It seems like all the groundwork Bormann laid before the the civil war, building connections with bankers, functionaries and aristocrats alike is finally paying off. A steady stream of donations and subsidies is securing our war effort, at least for the time being. We should use that advantage while we still can and buy up as much weaponry as we can."
 BOR_the_reichstags_champion:0 "The Reichstag's Champion"
 BOR_the_reichstags_champion_desc:0 "While some may say that the deputies of the Reichstag have scattered all over the various factions of the civil war, the largest plurality supports Bormann. A declaration by these men in favour of the legitimate successor will undoubtedly cement Bormann's reputation as the Reichstag's Champion. And who knows, we might even be able to convince a few wavering or undecided deputies from all over the Reich to join us for our cause."
 BOR_rally_the_bureaucrats:0 "Rally the Bureaucrats"
 BOR_rally_the_bureaucrats_desc:0 "It's not enough that simply the high level managers, administrators and leaders rally to our cause. The secretaries, low-level staff and workers are just as important. War is after all in many ways an administrative problem. By rallying the masses of the Reich's administration to our cause, we gain valuable and experienced body of labour that might just give Führer Bormann the edge he needs to succeed over the traitors."
 BOR_fight_for_your_money:0 "Fight For Your Money"
 BOR_fight_for_your_money_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a Soldier can not fight from faith in the Führer and the Fatherland alone. Mundane things such as food, rest & recovery or even access to fulfill other base desires cost money and even the staunchest Landser gets second thoughts when his pay is miniscule. With our deep financial reserves it is time for a general pay rise for all our forces across the front. With that surely morale will rise and desertion rates will go down. And maybe it will even convince some of the more flimsy supporters among our rivals to switch over to our cause."
 BOR_we_need_the_men:0 "We Need the Men"
 BOR_we_need_the_men_desc:0 "With the civil war still ongoing, our manpower is not what it used to be. Understrength units are starting to struggle to control the frontlines. We need more men, even if we have to compromise on the quality. From those unfit to serve, to deserters and even a few undesirables, those men who have so far fallen through the cracks of our recruitment and shirked their responsibility will be convinced to join our cause for good. Führer Bormann needs every man to do his duty after all."
 BOR_ALL_the_men:0 "ALL the Men"
 BOR_ALL_the_men_desc:0 "We need more men. We need them all and we need them now, but that is only possible by increasing the draft length and lowering the training requirements. Doing that is not going to be popular, but victory cannot be achieved without sacrifice. And with the situation across the Reich rapidly starting to go downhill and the civil war still ongoing, a lot of sacrifice still awaits the German people."
 BOR_we_need_the_cash:0 "We Need the Cash"
 BOR_we_need_the_cash_desc:0 "With no end to this blasted civil war in sight one truth is becoming evident: Most men cannot fight on faith in the Reich alone. Guns, Food and ammunitions require wealth, even now. Bormann's contacts all across Society can get us much of the cash, but to sustain a steady flow we should squeeze and pressure the Banks, confiscate property that belonged to traitorous individuals and loot those possessions we come into during the fighting."
 BOR_ALL_the_cash:0 "ALL the Cash"
 BOR_ALL_the_cash_desc:0 "The situation is deteriorating. Now even our formerly so deep pockets are increasingly scraping the barrel to fund the war effort. We have no choice but to go even further beyond in our schemes. That means loans from the banks at cutthroat conditions, requisitioning even from loyalist families and pressing even those of our supporters who can't give much for a Reichsmark or two.

 BOR_we_need_the_calm_desc:0 "Some of our people are getting rather nervous. The civil war is dragging on and on. Will it really end soon? Of course it will! This is Führer Bormann after all. And he will bring law and order back to the german lands. For that he needs calm, discipline and duty. The calm is what keeps us above the anarchy of the students or the madness of the SS. So all of you, keep calm and fight for Bormann, just a while longer. Please."
 BOR_ALL_the_calm:0 "ALL the Calm"
 BOR_ALL_the_calm_desc:0 "The situation across the Reich is, well, not ideal anymore. The length of the civil war is increasingly leaving permanent scars upon both the landscape and the people. Some weak minded fools have even started to whisper, that maybe Bormann isn't the man capable of bringing law and order back to the Reich. They will be proven wrong of course, but with things as they are maybe we need to take some action to make SURE they are convinced."

 ##Bormann Opening Tree
 
 BOR_der_wilde_ritt:0 "Der Wilde Ritt"
 BOR_der_wilde_ritt_desc:0 "The Bürgerkrieg has been won, and Führer Martin Bormann has come out victorious. For the moment our enemies have been crushed. However, Bormann's struggle to control the Großgermanisches Reich is far from over, for the Fatherland lies in ruin and if we do not act fast to rectify our poor situation it may embolden our enemies. To prevent any challenge to our rule, we must begin to mold Germany to Bormann's desires."
 BOR_first_things_first:0 "First things First"
 BOR_first_things_first_desc:0 "That being said, before we restore our glory, the Großgermanisches Reich must first reclaim the basics of living from the fires and horrors of the Bürgerkrieg. Now, what are these 'basics' we must reclaim? Well, Führer Bormann supposes that - rather evidently - food for the citizenry and the reconstruction of our once glorious infrastructure are precisely those 'basics'. Therefore, we will ensure that the people are fed and the roads paved!"
 BOR_slaves_to_farmers:0 "Slaves to Farmers"
 BOR_slaves_to_farmers_desc:0 "Regrettably the Führer cannot snap his fingers and cause a nation-wide banquet to materialize - while the Führer wields absolute power over our state, he is no god. There is a serious shortage of food that could result in the commencement of a famine and cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands if we do not act. However, we need not worry, as Führer Bormann has an ingenious plan to solve the impending crisis! We will simply put the slaves to work in Germany's agricultural industry en masse, so that we may produce the food required to feed the nation."
 BOR_soldiers_to_builders:0 "Soldiers to Builders"
 BOR_soldiers_to_builders_desc:0 "Sadly our Fatherland's once world renowned infrastructure lies in ruin, our cowardly enemies having deliberately destroyed the Großgermanisches Reich through their own greed and lust for power. Of course, one cannot be a Superpower if one's nation is a depressing smoking hole in the ground. Therefore, to restore the Großgermanisches Reich's most crucial infrastructure, soldiers with engineering experience are to be put to work, for they will help reconstruct our shattered Fatherland."
 BOR_notstandsrecht:0 "Notstandsrecht"
 BOR_notstandsrecht_desc:0 "In 1933, Führer Adolf Hitler passed the Ermächtigungsgesetz under the guise of a state of emergency. In a similar vein to his predecessor, Martin Bormann shall once again institute a Notstandsrecht in order to reaffirm his supreme role over the Großgermanisches Reich as its Führer. Once enacted, Bormann will have the ability to pass laws and dictate Germany's fate without the interference of anybody else."
 BOR_urban_reconstruction:0 "Urban Reconstruction"
 BOR_urban_reconstruction_desc:0 "The cities of the Großgermanisches Reich have suffered tremendous amounts of destruction and pain as a direct result of heavy house to house fighting during the Bürgerkrieg. Führer Bormann shall not allow for the Reich's population to live in miserable squaller anymore! We must enact a policy of rapid urban reconstruction. The Reich shall bloom with prosperity and happiness once more as we rebuild and revitalize our once beautiful cities."
 BOR_the_elephant_in_the_room:0 "The Elephant in the Room"
 BOR_the_elephant_in_the_room_desc:0 "That being said, there is an elephant in the room, one problem that we have yet to and must tackle immediately if our new Reich is to bloom like the old. The problem being, where do we store all the slaves? Of course, the original Slave Camps have unfortunately been largely destroyed in the flames of the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, we cannot allow these inferior undesirables to walk among us as free men! We must come to a quick decision on the matter or risk the Reich itself. "
 BOR_from_old_make_new:0 "From Old Make New"
 BOR_from_old_make_new_desc:0 "The sheer destructive force of the Bürgerkieg has left ruins littered throughout the Reich, shattered monuments to our violence. A weak man would mourn such loss, and watch silently on as the ghosts of our architectural triumphs haunt the cities forevermore.\n\nThe Führer is not such a man. In an act of genius, he has ordered these ruins to be recycled and utilized in the Great Reconstruction. From the broken, we shall rebuild. From the small, we shall make grand. From the old, we shall make new."
 BOR_academic_investment:0 "Academic Investment"
 BOR_academic_investment_desc:0 "The rise of the Reich dragged German academia from the depravity of liberalism to the glorious truth of National Socialism, and now the horrors of the Bürgerkieg have torn it down once more. Glory can only be sustained by the next generation of academics and scholars, and so we must invest heavily in the Reich's academic institutions."
 BOR_honor_the_war:0 "Honor the War"
 BOR_honor_the_war_desc:0 "Despite the destruction that it brought, the Bürgerkieg must never slip from our collective consciousness. We will pump state finances into the building of monuments and statues dedicated to the Führer's triumph, so that those loyal National Socialist comrades who sacrificed their lives for the German Reich may be immortalized forever in marble and stone."
 BOR_industrial_revitalization:0 "Industrial Revitalization"
 BOR_industrial_revitalization_desc:0 "The Großgermanisches Reich's industry suffered greatly during the Bürgerkrieg, with heavy fighting having damaged or destroyed significant portions of our industry. Rebuilding everything will take a considerable amount of time to accomplish, but to begin with we must at least help one of Germany's three industrial centers - Rheinische, Central, or Süddeutsche industries - which will not only assist in our return to economic normalcy, but is bound to earn the Führer favors he can use later down the line..."
 BOR_rheinische_kohle:0 "Rheinische Kohle"
 BOR_rheinische_kohle_desc:0 "In his wisdom, Führer Bormann has chosen to support the Rhenic industry. Notably reformist in its beliefs, the majority of Rhenic industries sided with Albert Speer's faction during the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, this does not and will not dissuade Führer Bormann! Speer's reformist clique are no longer an issue, and why would a bunch of boring workers revolt without the traitors working in their midst? Furthermore, it will serve the Reich well if we support their industry, known especially for their vast coal production."
 BOR_ruhrkohle_consolidation:0 "Ruhrkohle Consolidation"
 BOR_ruhrkohle_consolidation_desc:0 "Our efforts at restoration have proven successful. As a result of our timely intervention, the Rhenic coal industry has grown into a large, economically powerful and strong German industry!... So, it's time to consolidate our influence over it, as we don't want such profitable corporate entities to slip from our greasy paws, now do we? To do as such, Führer Bormann has sponsored the creation of 'Ruhrkohle AG', a new conglomerate corporation that shall administer Großgermanisches Reich's coal production."
 BOR_markischer_stahl:0 "Märkischer Stahl"
 BOR_markischer_stahl_desc:0 "In his wisdom, Führer Bormann has chosen to support the central German industries. Notably militaristic in its beliefs, the majority of the central German industries sided with Hermann Göring during the Bürgerkrieg. Just as the New Aryan Man is undaunted at every turn, this does not and will not dissuade Führer Bormann! The Reichsmarschall is gone and his clique corralled, making them irrelevant as an issue. Furthermore, it will serve the Reich well if we support their industry, known especially for its steel production."
 BOR_all_unto_reichswerke:0 "All unto Reichswerke"
 BOR_all_unto_reichswerke_desc:0 "The Reichswerke Hermann Göring had been a tool used with the direct purpose of assimilating state control over Germany's steel industries since before the commencement of the Second World War. Yet, with Göring's treachery and fall during the Bürgerkrieg, the Reichswerke lies dormant. However, they haven't lost their purpose yet and may still be useful to our cause. Dropping the treacherous Reichsmarschall's name, the new 'Reichswerke' shall absorb and administer the Großgermanisches Reich's new steel mills."
 BOR_bayrische_technik:0 "Bayrische Technik"
 BOR_bayrische_technik_desc:0 "In his wisdom, Führer Bormann has chosen to support the south German industry. Notably conservative in its beliefs, the vast majority of these south German industries sided with Martin Bormann during the Bürgerkrieg. With there being little political threat from these industries, there is nothing to dissuade our investment. Furthermore, these specific industries are known for their technological innovation, which may benefit the Reich in the long run."
 BOR_siemenswelt:0 "Siemenswelt"
 BOR_siemenswelt_desc:0 "Siemens AG, one of the Großgermanisches Reich's foremost technological giants, has now grown to the point with which it dominates the Reich's technology markets with ease. This is, of course, a direct result of Führer Bormann's meddling in the German economy and industry, which is good for us as their dominance will likely secure the Reich's lead in technology for decades to come."
 BOR_let_the_money_flow:0 "Let the Money Flow"
 BOR_let_the_money_flow_desc:0 "With the Großgermanisches Reich's industry now starting to get back on its feet, it's evident to the Reich's most experienced and well-versed economists that the state shall now begin to earn significant profit once more. With this in mind, all Führer Bormann has to say is: "let the money flow", covering the nation in the printed green of the Reichsmark."
 BOR_military_redeployment:0 "Military Redeployment"
 BOR_military_redeployment_desc:0 "The Führer's total victory in the Bürgerkieg heralds great change for the German people, but he cannot keep the flame of National Socialism alight without obedience to his new regime. The Reich is not yet fully pacified, and dissent still runs rampant through major cities and small towns alike. Student militias continue to train in their basements while radical militarists scheme in abandoned warehouses, and acts of terrorism are being committed every single day. We must redeploy the military and fully pacify our splintered nation."
 BOR_reintegration_efforts:0 "Reintegration Efforts"
 BOR_reintegration_efforts_desc:0 "The chasms between the different factions of the Wehrmacht must be sealed if we are to unify the Reich and rebuild its military. Those who sided with Speidel in Germania, those who joined forces with Göring, those who fought for Speer – all will be reintegrated into the Wehrmacht. A unified military force is essential to our survival, and while such efforts will inevitably see varying degrees of success, it is a price we are willing to pay."
 BOR_were_all_german:0 "We're All German"
 BOR_were_all_german_desc:0 "Despite the Reich's fractured political scene, and the horrors that unfolded during the Bürgerkieg as brother slaid brother, we cannot ignore the German blood that courses through our veins. Everyone who fought in the civil war are members of the Aryan race, bonded by blood and soil, and as such should be respected. After all, is it not German nature to take action through violence and conquest? To heal the nation we will promote unity, not division."
 BOR_smoke_them_out:0 "Smoke them Out"
 BOR_smoke_them_out_desc:0 "Is any trait more befitting of weak men than forgiveness? To oppose the rightful Führer Martin Bormann was to oppose the Reich itself, which many of our enemies sought to accomplish by rallying behind perverse denominations of National Socialism. Those in the Wehrmacht who betrayed their own blood in favor of degeneracy deserve to be punished however the Führer sees fit."
 BOR_some_are_more_german_than_others:0 "Some Are More German than Others"
 BOR_some_are_more_german_than_others_desc:0 "We all share German blood, but the manifestation of one's Aryan nature arises differently depending on the strength of this blood. Those who fought for Bormann and therefore National Socialism proved their absolute purity, while those who opposed him displayed a suspiciously subhuman mindset. Traitors should not, therefore, be considered wholly German."
 BOR_frieden_im_reich:0 "Frieden im Reich"
 BOR_frieden_im_reich_desc:0 "The deployment of our great military, and our actions taken towards its disloyal elements, have proven to be successful. Now that it has outlived its temporary role as a provisional police force, the Wehrmacht will once more serve as the army of the Reich, stronger than ever before. With the revival of our army comes the revival of the Reich itself and our reputation across the entire world."
 BOR_the_ride_goes_on:0 "The Ride Goes On"
 BOR_the_ride_goes_on_desc:0 "Through revitalization, reconstruction and redeployment, Bormann has made significant progress in forcefully shoving the fractures of the Reich together into a unified whole, and strengthening his grasp on power in the process. The ride, however, is far from over.\n\nThe Führer is setting his sights on one of the most crucial issues plaguing the nation: The influence of Speidel and Schörner on the future direction of the Wehrmacht's political alignment."
 BOR_realpolitik:0 "Realpolitik"
 BOR_realpolitik_desc:0 "While the Großgermanisches Reich survived the initial post-Bürgerkrieg woes by the skin of its teeth, our transition out of critical danger must not kill our desire to reconstruct the Fatherland. Indeed, Führer Bormann has spoken at length to the NSDAP elite about his desired intent to move toward consolidation regarding the conservative/reformist political debate. The time for balancing between two stools is over, and quite frankly it was a silly move to begin with. Therefore, we must formally decide which faction we shall support and which pieces of legislation our government shall enact."
 BOR_when_in_germania:0 "When in Germania..."
 BOR_when_in_germania_desc:0 "Martin Bormann is a political genius. The Führer's intuitive embrace of Machiavellian political and moral philosophy has allowed him to become the greatest political mind of his generation (at least, that is what the newspapers we produce say). Indeed, being the political luminary he is, Bormann has set his sights on tackling the current most dangerous conflict in Germany. For the Großgermanisches Reich to achieve Superpower status once more, the Wehrmacht's ideological divide must be solved and the opposing faction made to quieten down and actually follow our orders for a change.\n\nWe face a choice: Speidel's reformism or Schörner's militarism, both with significant levels of support in the senior Wehrmacht. To solve this, we shall arrange a meeting and decide once and for all, based on the immortal Führerprinzip - what the Führer decides shall be carried out, and that will be the end of the matter. As they say: 'When in Germania, do as the Führer do'."
 BOR_meeting_in_the_reichskanzlei:0 "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei"
 BOR_meeting_in_the_reichskanzlei_desc:0 "To settle the issue of political stability in the Reich with our eyes on mere grandstanding would be a deeply foolish measure. Too many lies hide behind these meaningless displays, too little can be ascertained from the shows of force and plays at relevance. To truly ascertain the value and truth of a man you need only pit him in a battle for his very existence. The Reformists and Militarists, Speidel and Schoerner- devils each, but which will prove most capable, which will prove most valuable to the Führer? Let us receive them both at the Reichskanzlei and through this forum see for ourselves which shall come out on top."
 BOR_retter_des_reichs:0 "Retter des Reichs"
 BOR_retter_des_reichs_desc:0 "Hans Speidel's performance during his meeting with Bormann have cemented him as the obvious choice for Chief of the OKW, and his intelligent arguments prove that the future of the Wehrmacht is in safe hands. With the Führer's blessing, Speidel may begin his reformations without restraint."
 BOR_review_the_wehrmacht:0 "Review the Wehrmacht"
 BOR_review_the_wehrmacht_desc:0 "To initiate his thorough reformation of the Reich's military forces, Hans Speidel has ordered an official review of the Wehrmacht, from its funding and organization to its chain of command and political leanings. Once he has obtained a completed picture, the Feldmarschall will push on with his radical changes."
 BOR_deutschland_uber_alles:0 "Deutschland über Alles"
 BOR_deutschland_uber_alles_desc:0 "Speidel's command of the OKW is not driven by a lust for personal glory and the consolidation of power, but a desire to strengthen the Wehrmacht as a powerful apolitical force within the Reich. Such a force, he claims, will ensure the preservation of the nation and the safety of its people. Deutschland über Alles!"
 BOR_ungeheuer_in_uniform:0 "Ungeheuer in Uniform"
 BOR_ungeheuer_in_uniform_desc:0 "With his radical proclamations for change enrapturing the Führer, Ferdinand Schörner has officially been appointed as Chief of the OKW, and orchestrator of the Wehrmacht's future. The Monster in Uniform, Bloody Ferdinand - all these names denote the Feldmarschall's brutal nature, but brutality may just be the key to revitalizing our army."
 BOR_little_black_book:0 "Little Black Book"
 BOR_little_black_book_desc:0 "In his mission to restore the Wehrmacht to its former glory and beyond, Schörner has forged an extensive list of his rivals in the armed forces. This 'Little Black Book' reveals the personal, political and military histories of these named officers, as well as the manner in which they should be dealt with. According to Schörner, some should be fired immediately, while others are to be forced into a more... permanent retirement."
 BOR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer:0 "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer"
 BOR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Feldmarschall Schörner is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve, and has been swift to stress how his ambitions openly align with that of the Führer and the Reich. Some may question his sudden change in attitude towards Bormann following his appointment as Chief of the OKW, and it is true that Schörner enjoys his newfound power... but he has risen the Wehrmacht to glory... A glorious Wehrmacht means a grateful people, a powerful nation, and a beloved leader!"
 BOR_waffenstillstand:0 "Waffenstillstand"
 BOR_waffenstillstand_desc:0 "The achieved consensus with regard to the Wehrmacht's alignment has seemingly secured the Großgermanisches Reich a stable future. With the public pleased and the government united, there is nothing standing between the Reich and the glories of the future. Führer Bormann's achievement of consensus has seemingly reinforced his political omnipotence over the state, and many accuse the Führer of acting in self-interest rather than with the selflessness due a man of his position. Quite frankly, these people are character assassins and do not understand that the interests of the state are the interests of the Führer. For their insolence we shall sweep them aside, and as we dismiss them from the halls of power we shall brand them with the name of their childish generation: 'Very well, Soixante-Quatards.'"
 BOR_a_thousand_year_reich_forevermore:0 "A Thousand Year Reich, Forevermore"
 BOR_a_thousand_year_reich_forevermore_desc:0 "We have succeeded in surviving the aftermath of the Bürgerkrieg, the Großgermanisches Reich has achieved relative political stability for the first time in decades. As a result, a powerful wave of optimism has swept across the Reich, the German people, hopeful of a good future, believe this is the commencement of a new glorious era for National-Socialism, a new golden age under Führer Martin Bormann is perhaps on the horizon. Yet, only time will tell. But given recent events, it's safe to assume the Thousand Year Reich will remain forevermore."

 ##South Africa
 BOR_the_reichs_war_down_in_africa:0 "The Reich's War Down in Afrika"
 BOR_the_reichs_war_down_in_africa_desc:0 "The rightful successor has finally triumphed and reunited Germany proper under his rule, but the Reich's wars are far from over. In darkest Afrika, our Reichskomissariats fight a brave war in protection of the Boers of the Union of South Africa. The Boers have long proved a civilising element to the barbarians of the dark continent, and their fight against the American-aligned Union must be supported to maintain the influence of the German Reich outside Europe.\n\nThe people of the Reich are battle-hardened but weary, for fighting fellow Aryans is not good for the soul. It will be good to give them a just war to reinvigorate them - to prove that Germany is not yet through."

 BOR_assess_the_situation:0 "Assess the Situation"
 BOR_assess_the_situation_desc:0 "It is not for nothing that Afrika is called the dark continent. It's vast lands have long remained undeveloped, and little information escapes our colonies outside official channels. The Bürgerkrieg severed these channels of communication, with our agents in the continent experiencing confusion at the simple task of to whom to send their reports. With the command structure effectively decapitated, our Reichskommisarriats banded together into Afrika Schild. The Schild's war against South Africa has further complicated issues, so it is vital we gain accurate reports of the situation on the ground and re-establish communications."

 BOR_huttig_has_to_suffice:0 "Hüttig Has to Suffice"
 BOR_huttig_has_to_suffice_desc:0 "Hans Hüttig, Reichskommissar of Ostafrika, is a deeply unpleasant man. The former concentration camp commander has taken those lessons to heart, and Ostafrika is ruled like a country sized version of Buchenwald. His cruelty is known from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, his racially pure SS troops enforce a strict caste system over their African subjects - and that hair. Still, he is an effective tool against the South Africans and must be aided - even if he does keep insisting his Reichskommisar peers are traitors."

 BOR_schwarze_adler:0 "Schwarze Adler"
 BOR_schwarze_adler_desc:0 "The deserts of Südwestafrika aren't good for much other than droving cattle. They spread out for miles, no settlement in sight and scarcely any civilisation at all, barring the German settlements on the coast of Windhoek and Walvis Bay. The one thing it is truly suited for is reaching the air.\n\nThe Air Fleet envisioned and developed by Reichskommissar Schenck is the beating heart of Südwestafrika, carrying goods where no road goes, maintaining communications across vast swathes of barren veldt and deep jungle, and delivering justice to any unruly natives who get the wrong ideas. Maintaining the support of this fleet will be vital if we are to make progress in Afrika."

 BOR_honorary_boers_honorary_aryans:0 "Honorary Boers, Honorary Aryans"
 BOR_honorary_boers_honorary_aryans_desc:0 "The Boers are long removed from their Dutch ancestors after two centuries of British rule, but they have maintained their Aryan blood nonetheless. They found their Lebensraum on the veldt just as we did in the east, and have done an admirable job spreading Aryan hegemony on their Great Trek. The German people should be reminded of this - the Boers will be officially confirmed as an Aryan race."

 BOR_help_the_hunter:0 "Help the Hunter"
 BOR_help_the_hunter_desc:0 "Although a significant distance from the frontlines, Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller's enthusiasm for hunting & warrior-like behaviors may prove useful to our campaign... yet, his penchant for warfare isn't particularly important, no, it is Zentralafrika's strategic location & natural resources that give Müller his true value. Thereby, it's best we choose not to disfavor the Reichskommissariat in favour of its continental contemporaries."

 BOR_alle_waffen_gegen_suedafrika:0 "Alle Waffen Gegen Südafrika"
 BOR_alle_waffen_gegen_suedafrika_desc:0 "Like a bloody, clinging vine, the South African war continues to hamper our efforts on the Dark Continent. It is critical that this conflict be brought to a swift and decisive conclusion: South African victory (which looks more certain by the day) will deny our forces access to strategic resources from the Congo Basin and the airfields of the southwest. It will also be a propaganda coup for the American jackals, which is arguably worse and certainly more damaging to the national pride. South Africa must be brought to heel by any means necessary!"

 BOR_bring_the_stahlhelme:0 "Bring the Stahlhelme"
 BOR_bring_the_stahlhelme_desc:0 "Whilst the native residents & security forces of our Reichskommissariats have successfully held the line against the South Africans, it's quite evident to Führer Martin Bormann that present operational strength is insufficient to bring about the overwhelming superiority necessary for victory on our terms. The Heer shall be brought to the South African conflict - and we anticipate no problems with their ability to continue combat in harsh and unforgiving terrain! German arms are, after all, the finest in the world."

 BOR_no_restraints:0 "No Restraints"
 BOR_no_restraints_desc:0 "To truly defeat & demoralize an enemy is not a test of steel or lead, but of resolve: we must break our enemies' will to fight by demonstrating our resolve. Regrettably, our adherence to trivialities like the "conventions of war" and "human rights" has only hampered our efforts in this war. It falls to the Führer Bormann to make the unthinkable choice: to sever all existing agreements between our side and theirs, including those on treatment on prisoners of war (or, as the General Staff calls them, dead weight). The night grows savage - let us howl with the wolves, and grow fangs to match."

 BOR_abwehrabteilung_afrika:0 "Abwehrabteilung Afrika"
 BOR_abwehrabteilung_afrika_desc:0 "The Abwehr, the military intelligence service for the Wehrmacht, may prove invaluable in ensuring our victory in what is becoming an increasingly complex tactical situation. The ability to predict enemy action will assist us in outmaneuvering functionally superior forces on the field, and give us the advantage of speed outside conventional combat areas. Our generals are already crafting a doctrine they refer to as Schock-Methode - "shock and awe" - to make use of these capabilities. An increase in funding to the Abwehr will accelerate the rollout of this doctrine and help save precious Aryan lives. The choice, quite frankly, makes itself."

 BOR_the_best_gear:0 "The Best Gear"
 BOR_the_best_gear_desc:0 "Regrettably, the armaments employed by our Afrikan Reichskommissariat-Defense Forces are rather outdated when compared to their regional contemporaries. The generals in Germania have blamed technological inferiority for the... compromised state of the war effort, and believe an infusion of technology, training and cash will increase the killing power of our forces - especially when faced with an enemy which disappears at every contact in the endless fields. We will funnel the most up to date & advanced weaponry the Reich poses into the conflict with the hope that our new weapons shall break the South African resolve."

 BOR_the_dissidents_war:0 "The Dissidents War"
 BOR_the_dissidents_war_desc:0 "As the Chinese say, with every crisis comes opportunity: the ongoing conflict in South Africa has granted the Großgermanisches Reich a heaven-sent opportunity to dispose of 'anti-social' individuals who continue to cause the government issues. The Reich trembles still with the sounds of rebuilding, and part of the process of healing is excision of all the negative elements that were left behind as the dust settled. It is clear that it would be a strategic advantage if these rogue elements were to take an extended holiday - preferably one they are unlikely to come back from in one piece."

 BOR_send_waffenss_remnants:0 "Send Waffen-SS remnants"
 BOR_send_waffenss_remnants_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS, once the most elite force in the Reich, is a shadow of its former self. The brainchild of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, these military units once took pride in being both Army and SS-associated, answering above all to Hitler while maintaining military discipline within its ranks. That all came crashing down when the majority of the Waffen-SS made the decision to fight against Führer Bormann. Yet, although their past ideological volition is concerning, these divisions can still fight for Bormann's Reich... send them to the front!"

 BOR_veterans_of_the_civil_war_desc:0 "While not technically trained as members of the armed forces proper, there are plenty of men who are willing to heed the bloody call once again. Given the abundance of Bürgerkrieg veterans of varying ideological affiliations in the Reich, a blind eye and a helpful nudge in the direction of the front may help us successfully hold it against the South Africans. We will begin large-scale deployment of these "volunteers" - many of whom are already on government assistance for disabilities - selling it as one last chance to prove their loyalty to the Reich. Let us hope they see sense and seize it."

Operation Weserübung, while not the most successful of our campaigns that year, was still an unquestioned success, as the decadent Allies were quickly forced out, and the resources of Norway became ours. Not only that, but the Nordic people of Norway became the first of the Scandinavians to be incorporated into our Reich. Finally, the fjords and harbors of Norway gave the Reich the opportunity to gain naval superiority over the North Sea, a benefit which would become all too useful in the invasion of Britain. With all of these advantages, it was no wonder that the decision was made to remain in Norway when the war ended. Norway has remained one of our most important Reichskommissariats, watching over the north and protecting the Fatherland.\n\nAs of late, however, our grip over Norway has collapsed completely. Terboven, seeing the impossibility of his situation, left Norway with his men to fight in the Burgerkrieg- an honorable decision, but one that destroyed our authority in the region. Such a choice leaves our north open to western imperialism, as even now the Americans circle the waters of the North Sea, looking for an opportunity to expand their hold.\n\nLuckily, the Reich has once again found its footing under Führer Bormann, and we find ourselves with the opportunity to recover the fortress we have lost.

Much of Norway, as infuriating as it is, is against the return of the Reichskommissariat, making our deal harder. However, when the first ambassadors sailed across the Danish Straits, they landed to something decidedly unexpected- a band, Jonas Lie himself, and swastikas waving in the wind next to their Norwegian counterparts. Things only got better from there.\n\nAs it turned out, when Terboven left Norway, the NS- a collaborationist party that controlled much of Norwegian politics- immediately devolved into multiple cliques of politicians, each fighting for control. After a hard-fought struggle, Lie and his brand of radicals seized power and took the government. Incredibly enough, Lie is more in favor of Germany than the moderates of the NS ever were. We did not even need to ask about a Norwegian re-entry to the Pakt- they suggested it themselves!\n\nOf course, such a positive development is being spread heavily among official papers back home. Already, crowds read fluff stories about the Norwegian's loyalty and belief in the Aryan dream- a loyalty and belief so great that they remained true to the Fatherland, even in our moment of greatest weakness. Such a tale has gone over quite well in the Reich, and it seems that Norway's re-entry to the Pakt is only a matter of paperwork now. Who knew it would be this easy?"

In fact, it's becoming an opinion of many in the government that the Norwegians were more loyal to National Socialism than much of Germany itself.\n\nOf course, such blind faith in our system deserves some reward for their effort. It has become a topic of some discussion in Bormann's inner circle that Lie and his clique deserve, at the very least, a commendation of their bravery and loyalty. Such an award would undoubtedly please the NS, and would set an example to other, less scrupulous Reichskommissariats that loyalty to the Reich will be rewarded."

Quite simply, it seems that some of the officials over the Baltic are more devoted to the National-Socialist dream than those at home. While this certainly raises questions about the work ethic of our own government, these are unrelated to the current topic at hand- the forced agrarianism of Norwegen.\n\nDuring the occupation years, a policy of forced agrarianism was forced upon Norwegen, forcing them to dismantle their factories and ship them off to Germany. They would then replace them with farmland and other agricultural products. These policies, while giving Germany proper a boost in industrial output, severely weakened the already unstable economy of the Reichskommissariat. The reasoning behind this, as Hitler stated back in the day, was to limit what the Norwegians could do in case they ever had ideas of rebellion.\n\nOf course, Lie's victory has entirely disproven this fear, and now the need for a policy that kneecaps our most loyal subject seems entirely useless.

As much as we'd like to prevent this, of course, German assets are limited in these times. We only have a small amount of forces that we can spare to help keep order- not nearly enough to maintain our rule across the Baltic.\n\nOnce again, however, the ingenuity of Lie and his followers comes through as an easy solution. Lie and his government have bent the party's paramilitary- the Hirden- to their will, and they now serve as a loyal force, united behind the radicals. By reinforcing these men with both guns and advisors, we can bolster our presence across the waves without diverting a full division or two.

Traditional holidays were replaced with German ones, celebrations of Germanic culture became commonplace, and the Lebensborn project was thrown into full force. Slowly but surely, the old traditions of Norway were replaced by the true, Germanic celebrations of Aryan supremacy.\n\nUnfortunately, Terboven's departure brought an abrupt end to these changes. Unbelievably, statues were torn down, swastikas ripped to shreds, and the traditions of the wayward Norwegian culture reared its head once more. While this disobedience undoubtedly deserves punishment, it has been decided that we shall simply restore those policies that have been lost. Once again, our loyal men in Oslo have proven to be a lifesaver- while they could not stop the reversal entirely, they certainly managed to contain the damage.

While this may not be our best case scenario, it is certainly not the worst that could have happened- we have worked with Lunde before, and our goals line up in most areas.

However, Lunde crossed a line by asking for more autonomy from the Fatherland. To accept such a request, so soon after we saw the near calamity that almost engulfed Norway only months ago, is something we could not accept.\n\nOf course, not many in Norwegen agree with this decision. We have already begun to receive reports of increased unrest in our northern fortress, and our relations with Lunde have cooled significantly.

The reasoning behind this, as Hitler stated back in the day, was to limit what the Norwegians could do in case they ever had ideas of rebellion.\n\nOf course, Lunde's victory has disproven this fear, and now the need for a policy that kneecaps our loyal subject seems entirely useless.

They seem heavily displeased with the actions we have taken to drag them, kicking and screaming, into a modern-day Aryan paradise. Perhaps they just don't understand.

However, in the wake of Terboven's exit, the Moderates have pulled a native defense force out of the people, which has been keeping things in check for the last months. After much debate, Bormann has directed that the Norwegians may keep their army, as well as allowing the average Norwegian to arm themselves in defense. After all, the NS clearly has control over the North, and the transfer to natives running the army allows us to consolidate resources that would otherwise need to be stretched all over the countryside. Besides, Norwegians are Nordic people, genetically close to the Aryan race. Why should we be running them as closely as we do with the Slavs and Africans? The solution is clear."

Such a proposal is laughable at best and downright insulting at worst- does he seriously believe that we would allow average citizens to bear arms? How many of these citizens would buy weapons to "defend themselves", only to turn around and sell them to Milorg or other decadent groups?\n\nOn the topic of native defense, it is yet another idea we cannot allow. Borten has proven to be a sometimes unwilling candidate, and he has caused trouble for us numerous times. Can such a man truly be trusted with his own army? It is of the opinion of Germania that a close eye must be kept on him, lest he try to break away from us in full. Were the Norwegians not wary of re-entering the Pakt?

While this plan goes against much of what National Socialist ideology preaches, one cannot deny that it has some clear benefits- Norway's GDP is bound to improve, and the increased Norwegian production will be a boon to all of the Reich.\n\nFor these reasons, Führer Bormann has decided to accept such a proposal, despite the complaints of many of his counterparts. Besides the obvious economic improvements, allowing Norway some extra autonomy is bound to sweeten their opinion of us further, as we slowly shift the perspective of Germany in Norway from that of a conquering empire to that of a Aryan brother and protector, leading all of Europe into a glorious future.

Such policy flies directly in the face of National Socialist doctrine at best and is downright treasonous at worst, but the kicker is the motive we suspect to be behind this action- Borten pretends that this is only for the good of Norway, but it's clear that this motion is meant to distance Norway from us economically, allowing them to slip away while we aren't looking!\n\nIf Borten truly believes that he can slide such treachery past us without us noticing, he'll be proven wrong. We shall twist Borten's attempt to break from us to our own ends, using his own desire to see his reforms through to tie Norway even closer to Germania.

In the chaos, the worst case scenario happened- the Milorg, long thought to be on their last legs, found a final surge of enthusiasm and seized power. The northern fortress, long thought to be impregnable, has been captured by decadent capitalists who now aim a dagger directly at the heart of National Socialism.\n\nThough many in the highest positions of Germany have advocated for immediate military action, Führer Bormann has decided against such an immediate action. Instead, we shall hold a conference with the Norwegian government. After all, we are more than warmongering brutes- the Aryan is not just a warrior, but a scholar and a statesman as well.

How can they actually convince the Norwegians, already high on the opiate of Western decadency, that partnership with the Germans is better? Worst of all, does Bormann truly even want this to succeed? The Führer is not well known for his love of capitalist nations, and his rather lackluster support of the conference seems to indicate a rather shaky interest in a peaceful solution.

Forces on high alert have been stood down, pilots that had been readied for deployment now suddenly see the fuel take from their planes, and the Kriegsmarine's crews are dismissed from their ships after days of waiting. Most interestingly, numerous special agents have suddenly been recalled, their unknown mission suddenly cancelled. All of this demobilization seems to have deflated the militarists, who were similar to the Führer in their full expectation of a glorious new campaign for the Heer.\n\nThough the success of these talks may have been unexpected, both nations can cheer for a new era of relations between the Aryans of Germany and the Nordic people of Scandinavia, now ready to move forward in an era of unity."

A new era of European cooperation seems to be dawning, and the partnership between Germany and Norway seems to be the first step on the path to a unified, proud Europe.\n\nOf course, the differences between the two are still massive. Norway's western, democratic outlook sharply clashes with the National Socialist doctrine that pervades through the Reich. Their capitalistic, free-market approach to economics drives a similar wedge in between the two nations. Some among the higher echelons of the Reich's political machine question why we ever negotiated with a rebellious subject. Bormann has his reasons, of course. Publically, it's because the Aryan is an inherently diplomatic race- one that can compromise and treat with anyone. Privately, it's because the cost of invasion would be much higher than necessary.

Reasonable discussion turned into shouting, shouting turned to insults, and insults led to the Norwegian delegation leaving the conference with no treaty.\n\nOf course, this was entirely expected in the Reich. Plans drawn up in the case of a negotiation breakdown are already finding themselves activated, as soldiers mobilize across the Reich for what could be the first major naval invasion the Reich has done since Sea Lion. However, the military may not be necessary if all goes well. Our agents have been hard at work in the cities of the northern fortress, and perhaps we will see a favorable outcome without needing to get our hands dirty.\n\nIn any case, it seems that the odds of blood remaining unspilt are diminishing by the hour.

Traditional holidays were replaced with German ones, celebrations of Germanic culture became commonplace, and the Lebensborn project was thrown into full force. Slowly but surely, the old traditions of Norway were replaced by the true, Germanic celebrations of Aryan supremacy.\n\nUnfortunately, Terboven's departure brought an abrupt end to these changes. Unbelievably, statues were torn down, swastikas ripped to shreds, and the traditions of the wayward Norwegian culture reared its head once more. While this disobedience undoubtedly deserves punishment, it has been decided that we shall simply restore those policies that have been lost."

By refurbishing it and modernizing its fortifications and infrastructure, we have an effective, nigh-impenetrable wall against any attempted SS rebellion or raid of our vulnerable Saar-Rheinland region.

From the Reich proper, their only significant trading partner is the oil company Wintershall. This firm must be banned from conducting trade with them, promptly, and an example set for the others. Secondly, we must up naval patrols in the British Channel to intercept Burgundian smugglers. Finally, we must try to pressure the Bretons into cutting off the Ordenstaat from their trade networks.

Now that we have endeavored to deepen our ties with them, we can exploit the fact that Himmler recently shattered and broke the back of the majority of the French State, humiliating them far deeper than even the Reich did in the forties. Hungry for revenge and eager to reclaim their people, we can easily pull them into a defensive pact against the Burgundians in return for promising them most of their lands back. We have all the land we could ever need in the East; trading the promises of some Western lands filled with Frenchmen and Himmlerites for a solid alliance against the evils of the SS is definitely working. They only need to hold the line until the armed might of the Reich can be brought to bear. They can do that, right?"

However, despite their innumerable shortcomings in almost every aspect, we share two things with the Americans: A desire not to let nuclear war ravage the planet, and a hatred for the racially inferior Empire of Japan.\n\nIt is because of these common causes that our wise Führer has decided to lessen the divide between the Reich and America. Foolish men may see this as a sign of weakness, but we know it instead as proof of National Socialism's inherent superiority. The Americans, seeing the strength that we hold, will take their place below us of their own volition. They only need a few little pushes in order to do so."
GER_BOR_OFN_Smile_For_The_Cameras_desc:0 "The American media is not kind to our Führer. After all, if they were to show a truthful portrayal of the Great German Reich, the dull American citizenry would be clambouring to immigrate to it! As such, the Americans portray Bormann as a monster, as they did Hitler before him. Before the Americans will accept any sort of deal with our nation, we need to show them that the Führer is not the inhumane murderer they have been brainwashed into believing he is.\n\nWe have arranged an interview between the Führer and an American journalist. We have, of course, set a few limits for what can and cannot be asked in this interview. This is not a means of deception, however, but a means of making sure that the American people get a true and thorough view of the Führer's character."
GER_BOR_OFN_Shift_The_Window_desc:0 "There are no boundaries to American hypocrisy. Proclaiming the ideals of freedom and democracy around the world, America has done everything to withhold the will of free nations of Europe to determine their own fate in the interests of the Aryan race. Crying crocodile tears over the oppressed Slavic nations, they do everything to submit countries in their own backyard. Their crimes against the Fatherland have not been left unnoticed, either. Where are the "freedom fighters" in Eastern Europe who did not fight with American weaponry and vehicles? Did the Arch-Traitor Speer not take his silver coins from the American departments?\n\nOne thing results from those facts: America is a dishonest political entity which speaks in lies and trickery and it is only fair that we act in retaliation against their perfidious machinations. To this end, we will assemble our secret services to conduct espionage work within the American territory. We will not instigate riots or anything of that sort - rather, we will use various forms of covert action to make America more interested in our partnership."
GER_BOR_OFN_Offer_Token_Concessions_desc:0 "Although our initial negotiations have started well and the American public in general was receptive to the beginning of the rapprochement, our efforts have not been enough to shift their attitude towards our geopolitical goals. The American diplomats insist on our concessions before they can start considering our demands.\n\nTo reassure the United States, can give them a small but significant gesture. Of course, we can't just give up our sovereignty and influence for every piece in Europe that is regarded as "occupied" or "disputed" by the American observers, but we can make small steps to show that we are as committed to world peace as they are. To show our interest in a mutually beneficial relationship, we can recognize Iceland as an independent state and revoke the Danish territorial dispute over the country. The Danes may not agree with this move, but their weight in the international relations is irrelevant to our bidding.

Surely, it was Führer Adolf Hitler who brought them victory at Pearl Harbor, but the Japanese atrocities in the Pacific were solely on their hands.\n\nIf there is something certain about the American society, it is that they loathe the Japanese more than us. We can manipulate their sentiments to get their public opinion of them on our side. Lamenting their national loss, we can remind them that they are not alone in their grief and that we, the Germans, know as no one else what it means to lose our national pride that was taken from us during after the Treaty of Versailles.

GER_BOR_OFN_The_Oriental_Concern_desc:0 "The Japanese Empire was an erstwhile ally of the Reich during the Second World War, and assisted our nation in the successful defeat and conquest of both liberal plutocracy and Bolshevik communism. Yet, our dalliance with the Japanese was always a marriage of convenience. They had their own reasons to come at odds with our mutual enemies, and there are enormous differences between both the government systems and ideological underpinnings of the German and Japanese states-not to mention our obvious racial superiority. As tensions with Tokyo over dominance of the Old World heighten, it is incumbent upon the Führer to find a new ally-of-the-day for the Reich.\n\nAs luck would have it, our old foes are in a fantastic position to provide such a role. The Americans hate the Japanese even more than they hate us, and the two have already nearly come to blows with the Hawaiian Missile Crisis. It would be wise for both of our governments to come to recognize Japan as a mutual enemy, and to coordinate our economic and military strategies to contain their power. As a side effect, bonding over shared abhorrence for all things Japanese might soften American perceptions of Germany more generally."

The CIA have no doubt stolen countless secrets and performed numerous acts of sabotage and disruption against the Reich. It is only fair that we return the favour.\n\nThe Opro will be deployed to the United States of America in great numbers, to infiltrate and sabotage American industry and political functioning en masse. Schematics will be stolen from American businesses, spies will be implanted in American intelligence networks, and our agents will turn over every stone they can find to discover information relating to American espionage efforts in the Reich.

A firebrand on foreign policy, Yockey is notably soft in his rhetoric against us, and would have all of the rage and hatred of the American patriot turned to the west, against the Japanese Empire and their occupation of American territory, rather than against the Reich in Europe. In lieu of an incumbent government willing to 'play ball' with Germania, as the Americans say, supporting the one man that we know surely would be friendly to the Reich seems a rational second option. Our friends in America will pay Yockey a visit, to make sure his sympathy for the Reich is sufficient to warrant our bankrolling of his career, and to discuss how our prospective assistance to America's favourite fascist might come about."
GER_BOR_OFN_Their_Part_of_The_Deal_desc:0 "Rapprochement with the Americans cannot and will not be a one-way street. Just as we are willing to make concessions for the benefit of our future relationship, so must the Yankees. The Reich has proven itself willing to respect American acquisitions in the North Atlantic and British Isles, and so must America respect Germany's acquisitions in mainland Europe. From the commencement of war in the 30's and to the present day, partisans across the Reich's European colonies have consistently had their acts of terrorism against the German order funded and equipped by American dollars and American weapons. If there is to be a detente between the President and the Führer, this abhorrent state of affairs must come to an end.

GER_BOR_OFN_Support_Their_Claims_desc:0 "Any fondness that once existed between the German and Japanese people is dead and buried, but even our great antipathy for Japan is nothing compared to the frothing rage of the Americans. Permanent Japanese occupation of the so-called 'Treaty Ports' is a disgusting embarrassment for the United States, and their return is easily the highest priority foreign policy objective for any American president. Owing to this, the White House will surely be most grateful for the number one global superpower to come to their aid and offer its sincerest support to rectify this terrible crime.\n\nHenceforth, the Greater German Reich shall officially recognize American sovereignty over the ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles. These great American cities have had their access to the Pacific carved away from them by untermenschen Asian aggressors for far too long, and the world ought to know that Germany stands behind their rightful return to American civilian and military control, 100%."
GER_BOR_OFN_In_Their_Backyard_desc:0 "America is not enough. Though it is the economic, military and political lynchpin of the OFN, containing the Orpo's overseas activities to American soil limits their effectiveness at inducing outcomes positive to the Reich and the German people. Are not the greedy industrialists of Canada and the corrupt security apparatuses of Mexico equally as susceptible to our espionage as any American businessman or politician might be? So why limit ourselves? We can even use the American's allies against them, implanting agents and forging documents from less secure jurisdictions, that we can then use to gather American intelligence under the guise of information sharing with allied partners. Let us make America's backyard a minefield of subterfuge, that they might find no friends with which to safely share their secrets."
GER_BOR_OFN_But_The_Best_Weve_Got_desc:0 "Our agents have returned from their meetings with Yockey, and their reception was mixed. The man seems to have no great love for any nation but his own, and nearly had one of our attaches reported to the police, his reticence no doubt motivated in part by a desire to avoid a headline on tomorrow's paper with 'Yockey' and 'Nazi spy' in the same sentence. A sane concern, obviously, but still a disappointing one for us.\n\nNevertheless, some of Yockey's underlings and financiers contacted our representatives after talks with the man himself failed to pan out. They're willing to take our money, laundered as donations from American businessmen, without Yockey ever having to personally know about the scheme. It seems Yockey is not quite loyal to Germania, but he's still the best chance we've got. For all of his "America First" rhetoric, he would still be far friendlier to the German Reich than any other man in American politics. Every million dollars we funnel him will be a million well spent."
GER_BOR_OFN_Only_Bormann_Can_Go_To_America_desc:0 "Relations with the Americans are improving measurably month by month, and the President has made numerous actions and statements conciliatory to Germany and to the Führer. One great obstacle still remains to the business of calling our relationship with the Americans fully repaired, however: that of an in-person meeting. All of the discussions so far between President and Führer have been through proxies, and Herr Bormann's feet on American soil would forever cement the great strides in cooperation and understanding made between the two titans of the Atlantic. Imagine it: the Führer of Germany, shaking hands and smiling in the Oval Office with the President of the United States. Could any sight be more striking?"
GER_BOR_OFN_The_Curtain_Closed_desc:0 "Rapprochement with the United States of America is impossible.

Perhaps our two nations' mutual animosity is for the best? A positive relationship with the Americans would surely bolster their incessant cultural corruption of our youth, and further the cause of the 'reform' movement inside the Reich. Maybe, it is best for Germany to keep its curtains closed, lest stranger's eyes peer inside our home and plot their nefarious plans against the German people. We can surely find a positive way to spin it. Führer Bormann making a stand against the American plutocracy, perhaps; our reasonable attempts at diplomacy rebuffed by a prideful old world power in decline; the Jewry of North America predictably sabotaging the proceedings. Whatever explanations we give, the German people at large will accept them, and hail the Führer both for his wise attempt to make friends with the United States, and for his brave refusal to ultimately do so."
