 #Leader Descriptions
 
 POLITICS_OLIER_MORDREL_DESC:0 "To say Brittany's relationship with the Pakt is... complicated, is perhaps one of the greatest understatements one can possibly make about the Reich's little entente. Originally named an autonomous zone of France, Mordrel found himself continuously annoyed by the fact that years on from the war the Bretons were still forced under French yoke.\n\nWhen the Reich forcefully tore what is now Burgundy away from France, Mordrel saw his chance. Proposing that a free Brittany, loyal to the Reich in all ways, would be far more useful to the Reich than the now decrepit French state. Within weeks of the formation of Burgundy, Brittany was declared independent as well in a conference attended by thirty nations. None of which were France.\n\nWhen the Reich tumbled into destitution in the 50s however, Mordrel reluctantly decided to begin importing food from abroad despite the embargo between the United States and Germany. Illegally smuggling in goods to keep Brittany afloat, the Bretons soon realized the value of selling the food to the starving and needy of the Reich. This situation only expanded, for as the Black Market expanded, Germany became more and more powerless to stop it and more and more reliant on its goods.\n\nNow, a decade later, Brittany stands as the staple port for illegal goods crossing into the Reich with Mordrel as its kingpin. While he has never professed any love for the Reich, they have so far kept the black legions of Himmler out of his affairs, and the pipeline of food, media, and much more illicit goods have certainly made Brittany as strong as he had once dreamed, even if the methods were a tad unexpected..."
 POLITICS_RAYMOND_DELAPORTE_DESC:0 "While Mordrel, Delaporte and Lainé were once brothers in arms and founders of the Breton National Committee, time has a way of causing all things to crumble. Time brought the Reich low, time ended the old order of Europe, and time too ended a partnership that saw Brittany rise from a forgotten footnote in history to the first European state to achieve its independence since the Second World War.\n\nThe true destruction of the friendship arose from the increasing differences in ideology, even while Brittany prospered and expanded. Mordrel became increasingly obsessed with his illegal trading, believing it to be the only way to a strong Brittany, and had become convinced that he could somehow play the various powers of the world against one another for the Breton good. Lainé had become disgusted with what he saw as Brittany growing weaker by the day and his two companions were increasingly worried by his growing hardline stances and the rapid militarization of the Bezen Perrot.\n\nDelaporte, however, saw his path in the opposite direction. An intellectual, he believed that democratic values and a denouncement of extremist sentiments would be the only possibility for a lasting Breton state. The abomination that is the Black Market had to be killed, and responsibility had to be taken for the horrors Brittany sold to the world, and the Bezen Perrot had to be shut down as the final step towards true freedom. Delaporte's denouncement of the Perrot was seen as a shock to the others, and his increasing declarations that liberty would need to spread to Brittany finished the deal.\n\nDelaporte cares little about whether these virtues will improve the world, but they will improve Brittany. Can any true patriot wish for anything else?"
 POLITICS_CELESTIN_LAINE_DESC:0 "Boots marching across Europe, tanks rolling over the ancient regimes and a single strong leader ruling over it all. The Reich showed the world true strength when it trampled upon its enemies and it inspired in Lainé the true strength that a strong and spirited military and a stronger leader could provide.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war and even more rapidly after independence was achieved, Lainé militarized the Bezen Perrot into his own personal force of stormtroopers, in every way modelled after the German SS. Seeing strong ties to the Reich and especially Burgundy as a necessity to maintain Breton strength, Lainé has numerous times called for Brittany to select the customers of the Black Market more carefully, and even declare itself a 'brother state' of Burgundy.\n\nAs he has increasingly radicalized over the years and his group of militants have increasingly turned into a private army, Lainé and his two former companions-Delaporte and Mordrel-have fallen increasingly apart. Whether it is Mordrel and his constant degenerate actions that actively harm Brittany's greatest allies or Delaporte's treasonous assinuations that Brittany should abandon the very ideals that gave it life, his two former friend's downfall was long foretold.\n\nWith his old companionships broken, Lainé let his tears be shed in private before marching out and preparing his men for the final step in Brittany's greatness. So what if friends will betray a man and old comrades leave him in the dust? Hitler himself was once nothing besides a struggling pauper. Lainé too will show the world what he is capable of, he will show his former 'friends' the insanity of their beliefs, and he will show Brittany that only he can keep her safe."
 POLITICS_GOULVEN_PENNAOD_DESC:0 "Born in 1928 and originally known by his French name Georges Pinault, Brittany has always been close to Goulven Pennaod's heart. A Breton nationalist from a young age, for a long time Pennaod's life revolved around the cause for Breton independence. Being too young to take part in the war efforts during the Second World War, he instead joined one of the many youth movements connected to Breton nationalist groups, and served with distinction.\n\nPennaod's claim to fame arose after the war, as he joined the armed forces of the newly established Breton state. With practiced skills he became the bane of French partisans seeking refuge and hideouts in Brittany, ensuring the continued stability of Brittany. In 1960, his efforts were recognized as he became the youngest general in the equally young Breton army.\n\nDespite the large influence Bezen Perrot held in the army, Pennaod never felt compelled to join the group, seeing his first and only duty being towards Brittany herself. In time, and especially after his promotion to general, this stubborness created friction between him (And his fellow non-BP officers) and the officers loyal to Lainé.\n\nAs the foremost officer still loyal to Brittany, it fell unto Pennaod to secure the state after Delaporte's revolution. But despite his good intentions, Delaporte bit more than he could chew, and risked the wrath of the Burgundians by flirting with the leftists. Pennaod and the Military Clique had to step in, to save Brittany from herself.\n\nNow in charge of the young democracy, it remains to be seen if Pennaod will succeed where Delaporte failed."
 POLITICS_YANN_FOUERE_DESC:0 "Jean Adolphe Fouéré was born in Aignan, southern France, on the 26th of July, 1910. From a young age, he would come to know firsthand the oppression of the Bretons under French rule, as Breton culture was suppressed in public life around him. In time, Yann Fouéré came to despise the situation, and effectively turned to Breton nationalism.\n\nHaving served a distinguished career in various Breton newspapers, Fouéré was also active in Breton politics. While a Breton at heart, he became a supporter of federalism as laid out by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and has been advocating for it in his numerous newspaper articles. For a long time, there were merely his own musings, as necessity demanded an alliance of all democrats in Brittany, and for all to look past their differences in order to guarantee the success of the revolution. Now, things have changed.\n\nAfter taking control of the so-called Moderate Wing of the SAV, Fouéré was free to spread his federalist ideas to his comrades. And as evidenced by his election of the president of Brittany, his ideas had struck a chord.\n\nWith the way clear, Fouéré is free to chase his dreams. While not yet announced, he has been crafting a theory of a federalist Europe, where Europe is redrawn according to regional borders, forming ethnically homogenous states. These states would then from a pan-European federation of nations, an Europe of a 100 flags.\n\nIt remains to be seen if such radical ideas will strike the same chord among his supporters as his previous ideas."

As 1962 begins, that's about to change. With plans of global Black Market hegemony, Olier Mordrel has set out to grow the Black Market's reach all around the world. This is where you come in.\n\nAs the player, your objective is to create a Black Market that could raise Brittany into a world power. To do this, you will need to think strategically, stay on top of world events, and avoid investing on the losing side (Unless prolonging the conflict is your goal, in which case, good thinking.).

Two, the target country must have ten or more military factories. And three, the target country must have the technology relevant to what you are buying (If they have not researched attack helicopters, you can't buy attack helicopters from them either).\n\nFor a detailed list of what you will exactly receive upon purchase, examine the descriptions/tooltips found by hovering over the relevant decision. To simplify, higher presence means more equipment and smaller costs.\n\nThe type of equipment you receive depends on the technological level of the target country.\n\nLuxury goods work a little differently. For every nation with a Luxury Trading operation in it, you have a monthly chance of gaining goods. With Light presence, the chance is 25%, with Moderate, 35%, and with Substantial, 45%. These goods will then be stockpiled ready for sale, you can see your current stockpile in the luxury trading category."

Unlike military equipment sales, these sales are completed among the less reputable citizens of the target country, and as such will have a chance of failing. The risk of a shipment being caught increases with larger shipments, however larger shipments are also more profitable. Consider the risk-benefit ratio before committing. On that note, when increasing Luxury Trading operations, consider the fact that every increase of Luxury Trading operations necessitates the increasing of luxury good shipments; You can't sell small shipments to a nation with Substantial Luxury Trading operations, for instance."

 BRT.32.t:0 "With Friends Like These..."
 BRT.32.desc:0 "Out of the original founding of the Breton National Committee, three friends would emerge as the central figures of Breton politics. Olier Mordrel, Raymond Delaporte and Célestin Lainé would form a powerful trio orchestrating the eventual independence of Brittany. However, as time went on, the three came to have different understandings of what was best for Brittany.\n\nMordrel has been in control of Brittany ever since its formal independence, and the infamous black market was largely spearheaded by him and his supporters. Meanwhile, Lainé has been making sure the Bezen Perrot keeps growing stronger by the day, and in his position as the paramilitary's leader he has kept Brittany secure. Lastly, Delaporte has been responsible for keeping the Breton National Committee in line, making sure that pandemonium does not break out and laws are smoothly passed.\n\nThe ideological differences between the three have finally reached a boiling point; The first one to take action is likely to emerge victorious, and have the chance to guide Brittany towards a future they see fit."
 BRT.32.a:0 "...Who needs enemies?"
 BRT.33.t:0 "The Champion of Democracy"
 BRT.33.desc:0 "Little did Mordrel know, but the forces of democracy form a silent majority among the Breton people. Delaporte on the other hand knows this very well. As Mordrel continues down the path of nepotism and corruption, and Lainé shows no signs of seeing sense, it's high time to take action.\n\nThe plan is simple; First, the head of the snake that is fascism, Mordrel, can be taken out of the picture by the simple act of bribery; Our man in the government, Yann Fouéré, should be able to take care of this. Secondly, with the support of those not under Lainé's boot, the Bezen Perrot can be sidelined completely by eliminating their chain of command. Namely, the promising young general, Goulven Pennaod, will be instrumental in this.\n\nIt's sure to be a risky campaign, but no price is too high to achieve democracy. And Delaporte is not alone in thinking this."
 BRT.33.a:0 "The Breton people stand with Raymond."
 BRT.34.t:0 "The Right Price"
 BRT.34.desc:0 "As the cabinet was dismissed after a typically short meeting of fifteen minutes, Fouéré remained seated as the rest left the room. Mordrel, still busy with signing some paperwork of dubious value, soon realized he was not alone. As they met each others eyes, Fouéré rose from his seat.\n\nAs he walked over to Mordrel, he produced a sealed letter from his jacket. Without exchanging a single word, he slammed the letter with slightly more force than intended onto Mordrel's desk. A few tense seconds of staring at each other passed, until Fouéré finally excused himself and left.\n\nSlightly puzzled by the theatrics, Mordrel nevertheless wasted no time in opening the letter. As he poured the contents on the desk, the fluttering of paper was accompanied by the clang of metal. A key. And more importantly, the note, which congratulated Mordrel on his immediate retirement, and informed him that the key would open a safe in a secure location, containing 50.000.000 dollars."

 BRT.35.t:0 "Lainé's Downfall"
 BRT.35.desc:0 "Goulven Pennaod, escorted by a number of his men, practically crashed inside Delaporte's headquarters. In addition to grime and bruises, something of a smile covered all their faces. Soon, Delaporte and friends were smiling as well.\n\nEarlier that day, at the crack of dawn, Pennaod and soldiers loyal to him all around Brittany had assaulted key locations of the Bezen Perrot. The operations had gone smoothly, as the paramilitaries were not prepared for such an aggressive move, though both sides took a few casualties as the more fanatic elements realized what was going on.\n\nRegardless, all major players of the Bezen Perrot are now in custody, including Lainé himself, who was captured en route to a barracks in Brest. It remains to be seen whether the now leaderless Bezen Perrot will manage to mount a defense when we launch our final operation to take over the government proper."

 BRT.36.t:0 "Dawn of the Revolution"
 BRT.36.desc:0 "Lainé has always been a man of action. This trait is what places him above the likes of Mordrel and Delaporte. While those two have been scheming in the shadows, Lainé has been preparing for the eventuality of internal conflict for years. And now, it's finally time to put the preparations to use.\n\nIn order to secure the state from forces aiming for its ruin, the ruling government must be neutralized. Most of all, Mordrel himself must be eliminated for good. Additionally, Delaporte and his fellow fools must be prevented from taking advantage of the chaos that will inevitably erupt.\n\nFor a long time, members of the Bezen Perrot have been waiting for the day when Brittany calls upon them to defend herself. The clock is ticking."
 BRT.36.a:0 "It's almost midnight."
 BRT.37.t:0 "The Conference"
 BRT.37.desc:0 "As Lainé sat down, the rest of the general staff followed suit. While Yann Goulet and Alan Heusaff, loyal members of the Bezen Perrot, seemed calm, they were well aware that this meeting might end in blood. Louis Feutren and Goulven Pennaod, the youngest members of the general staff and known only for their loyalty towards Brittany, similarily had some notion as to the purpose of the meeting.\n\nAs Lainé proceeded to bring everyone up to date on the plans of the Bezen Perrot, Feutren and Pennaod remained silent. Their stern faces betrayed no signs of worry or panic. As Lainé finished his speech, explaining how and when Mordrel was to die, a silence fell over the room.\n\nWith all eyes of the room on the two young generals, Lainé stood up. The soon-to-be-free nation of Brittany..."
 BRT.37.a:0 "...Will need these young, talented generals."
 BRT.37.b:0 "...Will not miss these two men."
 BRT.38.t:0 "Budget Cuts"
 BRT.38.desc:0 "A little known fact is that the Bezen Perrot depends on government grants to function at the size it does. Both Mordrel and Lainé are of course very well aware of this. Calling the dismantling of the Bezen Perrot a \"purge\" is merely dramatic flavour, as the organization began crumbling as soon as funding was cut.\n\nIt wouldn't take long for membership to fall down to appropriate levels, but Lainé's position as the Security Minister was a whole other problem. As there was seemingly no reason to fire him, a deal was struck in order to have him step down peacefully. In exchange for not outlawing the Bezen Perrot completely, Lainé would let his fellow officer of the general staff, Goulven Pennaod, a man of known loyalty to Brittany, to take his place.\n\nIn the end, the era of the Bezen Perrot dominating military affairs within the nation was all but over, and their downfall was mirrored in the popularities of the Burgundian Position and Traditionalist Wing withing the SBB."
 BRT.38.a:0 "Just as planned."
 BRT.39.t:0 "No Mercy for Traitors"
 BRT.39.desc:0 "At dawn, the Bezen Perrot moved out in force. Members of the government opposing Lainé were hunted down en masse, imprisoned if practical, executed if possible. The three main players of the government were the main objectives of the operation.\n\nFrançois Debeauvais, the Head of Government, was located within his home in Brest. The unit made assaulted the building, catching Debeauvais still in bed. Unfortunately, an error in judgement resulted in the death of his family along with him.\n\nYann Fouéré, the Delaporte plant within the government, was ambushed while on his way to work. The car he was in was filled with lead while stuck in traffic, resulting in the deaths of him and his driver.\n\nYann Bricler, Mordrel's cousin and no stranger to attempts on his life, was found in a small Brest café. Not going out without a fight, he managed to wound two members of the Bezen Perrot, before being taken out. The firefight sadly resulted in a number of civilian casualties.\n\nAs chaos and panic began spreading through Brest, only the head of the snake remained standing."

 BRT.40.t:0 "Risky Business"
 BRT.40.desc:0 "While Delaporte and Lainé scheme behind the scenes, thinking that Mordrel is not fully aware of their little plans for revolution, Mordrel has been preparing a scheme of his own. For too long the extremists have been allowed to run freely. It's high time to put an end to it.\n\nThe democrats claim a majority of their legitimacy from the fact that Yann Fouéré, one of theirs, occupies a seat in the government. While Fouéré is their greatest strength, he is also their weakest link. Dealing with him should neutralize the SAV.\n\nAs for the Lainé clique within the SBB, the Bezen Perrot is their base of power. By either containing or purging to paramilitary organization we can cut Lainé's influence down to its appropriate size.\n\nHowever we choose to deal with the dissidents, in the end, the house always wins."

When questioned later, the officers mentioned how Fouéré had seemed to be in a hurry, even. Understandable, considering the stunt he pulled.\n\nWe presume the mass of letters, with his signature in each one, had been sent the night before he left the country. Practically all representatives of the Committee who had ever so much as said a good word about democracy had received this short manifesto. The contents of this essay are not important, but surely enough, this successful, if petty, revenge has made us look bad.\n\nAs for Fouéré, he has already reached Ireland, and is out of our reach. It seems he is now organizing a society for other exiled Bretons, though only time will tell if it remains a simple literature club, or if it evolves into something more dangerous."

The Bezen Perrot guards who had showed up for work chose not to open fire on the thousands of Bretons marching their way. The building was captured, and Raymond Delaporte, who had been marching right beside the people, emerged from the masses to deliver his first speech as the first president of Brittany."

Luckily for us, as soon as the two realized they're working together, discussion simmered down to an appropriate minimum.\n\nRegardless, it will take some time and effort to return things to working order within the National Committee."

Thousands of local members in marching formations forced their way through democratic protests in Brest, and as one might imagine, a violent clash began. Both sides were more than eager to rise to the challenge, and for hours, central Brest turned into a scene of medieval pandemonium. Miraculously enough, neither side fired the first shot, and the clashes did not claim any lives.\n\nAlready Lainé and his cohorts have announced further parades to be held, not only in Brest, but all around Brittany."

A number of protest leaders and other undesirables were collected from their holding cells around Brittany, and are now being interrogated to root out their co-conspirators.\n\nAs expected, it does not take many extremities to get the traitors to talk, and the Bezen Perrot has been quite busy rounding up those who survived the protests."

A nation lead not by a single man or elected representatives, but by a board of directors, chosen on merit, not popularity. A corporation in all but name.\n\nAs he rose from his creaking leather chair, he could feel the years of leadership trying to press him down again. More than two decades in charge of a nation will do that for you, ask any dictator, he thought to himself. As he rolled the combination lock on his personal safe, his mind wandered to faraway lands. After his upcoming retirement, where would the vast wealth he had gathered along the years lead him? Somewhere tropical? Or perhaps temperate? The sight inside the opening safe have the answer: Wherever he damn well pleased.\n\nBut one thing was certain.

This sight was the breath he had been looking for.\n\nAs his mind wandered, so did his eyes, as he caught sight of an old photograph on his desk. The three of them looked so young back then. More than twenty years younger, to be specific. And much happier. Poor, misguided Célestin, so full of life back then. And Olier, well, Olier looked as tired as he always had. But back then, as much of an ideologue as Raymond.\n\nHe had sacrificed as much as any other democrat in Brittany, he thought to himself. But there was no price too high for liberty, as the slogans said. The sight from his window seemed to reinforce this thought. As he took in the air of freedom one more time, he closed the window, and headed back to the celebrations."

Though he had never had any interest in the position, his colleagues had convinced him that the dangers of too much freedom could place all Bretons in danger. And to a degree, he agreed; There was no way Burgundy would look from the sidelines should, God forbid, a left-wing government rise to power in Brittany.\n\nAmong the general staff, Pennaod was chosen as the representative of the so-called Military Clique. Again an honor he had not asked for, but after his election, he began to wonder if fate did not care for what he wished for. If things kept going like this, he'd eventually find himself Führer of the Reich. The silly thought made him smile, and as he looked up, he saw the rest of his friends smiling as well. Perhaps things would turn for the better after all.\n\nAs for the fate of Brittany, Pennaod had a clear plan; The democratic processes would be reformed under the guidance of the Military Clique, and only when everything was perfectly ready, new elections could be held. This was Delaportes mistake after all; Too much, too fast. Should everything go as planned, Pennaods Military Clique would become the guardians of democracy.

With Delaporte, having taken the brunt of any backlash from the revolution, out of the way, he could focus on his grander project; Reinforcing democracy throughout Europe. In his vision, Brittany would become the very definition of a democratic nation, a shining beacon for all of Europe to follow. And in time, like Brittany, Europe would be free as well.\n\nHowever, his more grandiose plans would still have to wait; Delaporte still posed a threat, and the upstart Pennaod could prove equally dangerous.

For years, they had been monitoring Breton Black Market activities on a global scale, disrupting business whenever they could. Ever since Lainé had diversified the Market, the organization had grown nearly fanatical in their anti-Breton propaganda.\n\nHe tossed the folder in the trash. They could whine as much as they wanted, but there was nothing they could do to stop him. The Black Market had gathered many powerful allies during its existance, from criminal organizations to government agencies, all willing to lend a hand in exchange for a favor or two. And most importantly, Lainé could trust that Brittany stood behind him.\n\nAn age of unprecedented wealth had convinced Bretons that their way of life was right. And Lainé agreed, wholeheartedly."

But with that thought, something darker came to mind.\n\nDespite his best efforts, there were still elements in the Breton society opposed to his new order. As he walked the streets, the signs were everywhere; A graffiti there, a foreign language overheard here, minds too relaxed everywhere. There was still much work to do if he wanted Brittany to be the great society he imagined, knew, it could be.\n\nAs he walked past an arrest in progress, the strikes of batons on degenerates reminded him; Almost there.

With Germany victorious, the Bezen Perrot had played a crucial role in achieving what countless Bretons in the past had only dreamed of: Liberating Brittany.\n\nToday, the Bezen Perrot has grown from its Waffenverband days into a considerable force, having considerable influence over the armed forces and the defense of Brittany. However, the Bezen Perrot is still considered to be the armed wing of the Strollad Broadel Breizh (Having ousted the Bagadoù Stourm from its position as the SBB's paramilitary force), and therefore has much say in the politics of Brittany.\n\nThis fact has not eluded the leader of the Bezen Perrot, Célestin Lainé, and with the recent friction between Lainé and Mordrel, the Bezen Perrot may be aiming to gain a majority within the SBB."

 BRT_general_election_first_desc:0 "The first free elections to choose the president of Brittany are commencing. Months of planning and hard work have went into making this happen, and three candidates have risen as possible future leaders of the Bretons.\n\nEveryone knows Delaporte, the man behind our democracy. As the elections were first planned, his past successes made him the clear favorite to win the election, but as the political arena widened, his support has shrunk accordingly.\n\nNamely, the more moderate elements of the SAV have decided to lay their hopes on Yann Fouéré, the new leader of the Moderate Wing of the SAV. Clearly the most liberal of the presidential candidates, Fouéré may be able to unite the somewhat chaotic BNC behind a common cause.\n\nLast, but certainly not the least, stands the leader of the Military Clique, Goulven Pennaod. His candidacy, born out of a black swan event caused by the general staff's worries about the increasing left-wing influence in the government, is considered a mere protest move by some, but Pennaod's popularity within Brittany as the leader of loyalist army forces and the protector of the republic could very well translate into electoral success.\n\nThe ballots are open, and so is Brittany's future."
