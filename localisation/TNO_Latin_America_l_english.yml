LATAM.10_lott_title: "An Offer from the Andean Pact"
LATAM.10_lott_desc: "Henrique Teixera Lott had not left much to chance during his term in office. He sometimes liked to think that fate had rewarded his diligent work. More often, however, the president had no time for idle speculation. All that mattered were efforts, and results.\n\nOn this late afternoon, late into his presidential term, Walter Salles and Tancredo Neves had both taken the time to visit the president. The matter was of great import; something once merely overheard in whispered rumors had now come to pass. Chile and Peru had gone ahead and united their strength into a new economic union. The Andean Pact, as it was named, would seek to do what had not been accomplished in hundreds of years of European presence in South America: a unified regional economic market. Hence the presence of the two essential ministers\n\n"Then, gentlemen, your thoughts?" Asked Lott. Neves spoke first, his eyes gleaming.\n\n"The possibilities, Mr. Lott! A regional common market, where we are free to progress on our own, not beholden to Washington D.C. or Tokyo."\n\n"I agree with Mr. Neves." Said the foreign minister Salles. "The benefits from joining in are likely to be great, both from increased trade as well as better ties with our neighbors."\n\n"With all of our neighbors but Argentina." Said the president.\n\nSalles nodded. "Mr. Denys is lukewarm on the idea of a pact." The foreign minister said. "He argues that those who don't join in the pact risk being irritated and set up rival tariffs and alliances. Better to coast on neutrality and good relations with all."\n\n"An interesting case." Lott sighed. A final matter of his presidency. A decision would need to be made, eventually. But which? The president asked himself, sitting opposite his two ministers."
LATAM.10.lott_a: "Call Santiago, this opportunity is too good to pass up."
LATAM.10.lott_b: "We cannot join now. Brazil must weigh its options carefully."

LATAM.10_quadros_desc: "Rest from the day's work. Da Silva poured the president another drink. Arinos played with his lighter, awaiting the next round of toasts.\n\nThe three men were in a good mood. Alcohol thinned the edge of excitement. Words chosen carefully, lest the avalanche of thoughts turn into a cascade of words and ideas.\n\n"A regional economic alliance the likes of which South America has never seen! Just think of the possibility!" One of the three men said. Another pointed out the risks. "Tokyo will no doubt try to get in."\n\n"Or America will sabotage it."\n\n"You two worry too much."\n\nQuadros drained his glass. Refused another one. Serious events were a foot, serious conversations were held. He and his foreign policy partners in crime were amazed by the news coming out of Santiago. The Chileans and Peruvians were planning a new trade bloc, the Andean Pact. For a president determined to steer Brazil free of foreign imperialism, this was one of the major upsets of the decade. Of the century, perhaps!\n\nThe conversation rolled on and on, occasionally dimming to embers, oftentimes roaring back by blazing passion. Should Brazil join in? Try to take a leading position, or work in concert with other factions. What of Argentina, and others that refused to join in? Should Brazil sit on the sidelines, and observe how events unfolded?\n\nOn and on the discussion went, until something of a consensus emerged."

LATAM.10.quadros_b: "Sadly it is not in Brazil's interests at this time."

LATAM.10_jk_title: "A Proposal from the Andean Pact"
LATAM.10_jk_desc: "Neatly arrayed maps on the walls of the Palácio do Planalto meeting room. Precise reports on various infrastructure projects, chief of which was the Trans-Amazonian Highway. Columns after columns of methodically arranged numbers. President Kubitschek's check up on the health of his various initiatives were often gently mocked by various staffers as the patterns of a country doctor making sure the village's children were growing up strong and healthy.\n\nThe day's topics, however, reflected foreign affairs. Minister of Foreign Affairs Negrão de Lima had come in with the incredible news from Santiago. The Chilean and Peruvians were announcing a new trading partnership, open to all nations of South America.\n\n"A phenomenal opportunity!" Said Roberto Campos. "With our booming industry and with the integration of all our provinces through the Trans-Amazonian highway, lowering tariffs with our neighbor would be pure profit. We can carve out an economic niche away from the overbearing influence of the Americans, without selling out to the Japanese."\n\n"A great opportunity indeed. If we are to be winners, are there going to be any losers from this Andean pact?" Asked Kubitschek.\n\n"It's supposed to be a win win for everyone. Word on the street, however, is that Argentina has declined joining it." Said the foreign minister.\n\n"If that's the case, Brazil would be by far the biggest member of the bloc."\n\n"A good point." the president looked to the array of maps. "Regional balance will be severely affected. Argentina will never buy our policy of friendly neutrality if our partners surround them."\n\n"It need not be such a big deal, I think." Negrão de Lima said. "If we stand as the first among equals within the Andean Pact, we can lead it and use it as a tool toward greater peace and development throughout the region."\n\nCampos and Kubitschek nodded. The discussion went on towards a few more topics. Eventually, the president made up his mind, weighing both options up."

"Chile and Peru have reached out to us through informal channels to sound out how we feel about their proposed trade union."\n\n"A danger to regional balance. Perhaps also an opportunity?" Asked Lacerda. Leitão da Cunha thought a few moments, before replying.\n\n"A good opportunity, sir. If we play our cards right. Argentina will certainly not join."\n\n"Any news from Washington?"\n\n"They've kept mum so far. Official line is that they celebrate every relationship between free nations."\n\n"We'd probably have heard about it if this really irritated them." Said the president. "They are probably waiting to see how it shakes out, like us. Hmm..." Carlos Lacerda did not find himself often at a loss for words. "Were we to join, the Argentinians would be blindsided. This could be a great opportunity to promote OFN interests across the region."\n\n"The facts are as they are, sir." The Foreign Minister said cautiously. "The decision about what to do is yours.""

The president indulged occasionally in the excellent meals provided by his chef. His ministerial cabinet was more often than not included in the bounty, as was the case on that evening.\n\nThe most recent news had encouraged Adhemar to invite Foreign Minister Leitão da Cunha and Economy Minister Barreto to partake in the rich food. News that Chile and Peru had jointly declared the creation of a new trade bloc, the Andean Pact. Adhemar and his associates discussed this business opportunity over several courses. "Gentlemen, what are your thoughts on this recent development?" Asked the president.\n\nThe conversation that ensued flowed from topic to topic. Encouraged by the president, Barretto discussed the potential benefits to the Brazilian economy, jobs at risk from free trade, potential electoral gains from the resulting economic boom, as well as factions within the business community and their likely opinion on the new trade zone. Over dessert it was Leitão da Cunha's turn to discuss foreign policy implications of the trade deals; generally positive for Brazil, with the possible exception of frosty relationships with Argentina, a country unlikely to join the pact.\n\nAt the end of the delicious meal a bottle of Port wine was passed around. The two ministers looked at their president quizzically. "Your thoughts, sir?" asked Leitão da Cunha. "We've done most of the talking"\n\nAdhemar smiled, and spoke..."

LATAM.10_goulart_desc: "He was back. Brasilia was still a new and uncertain thing to Vargas - when he had retired, all the back-stabbing and backroom deals all happened in the shadow of Cristo Redentor. It felt too modern, all too sleek and streamlined as a machine had designed it. Rio was overcrowded and underdesigned, but it was unmistakably Brazilian. What that meant, Vargas really couldn't pin down. Times were rapidly changing for Brazil, and if this quiet conversation went the way he hoped - then the entire continent would follow suit.\n\n"Ah, our man of the hour!" a man with thick-rimmed glasses came to shake his hand. "We were just waiting for your arrival. My name is Hermes Lima, Goulart and Neves and the rest of the cabinet is just in the other room." Vargas followed the eager man into the conference room. It was small, and there were no windows. It was a shabby room - like a relic from his Presidency - but he gave a thin, knowing smile to himself. It was in places like these where history was made.\n\n"Getúlio! I'm glad you could make it here." Goulart got out of his seat and shook his hand firmly. "My apologies for the haste, but we must press forwards." Vargas nodded in acknowledgement and took his seat. It was hard not to notice the eyes of the entire room on him. "Okay, people. Now that we're all here. Let's get on. I propose that a defensive alliance between the nations of South America should be made, to protect ourselves from foreign influence. I know that most of us are for that, but does anyone have suggestions?"\n\n"This is ridiculous!" one cabinet member shot out. "Getting ourselves involved would imbalance Latin power imbalances and throw our nation into chaos! This alliance would have us pouring gasoline all over the continent to put out an ember!" the entire room dissolved into a tense quiet.\n\n"It is not enough." Vargas broke the silence. "It is not enough to have an alliance and hope for the best. This alliance, or pact, must be strong enough to bend but not break. What good would it have us if Ecuador and Colombian squabbles disrupted our unity? We must take the reins and lead the continent - not as Emperor - but as a guiding force!" Some in the room nodded and murmured in approval - especially Goulart and Lima."

LATAM.10_castelo_desc: "President Castelo Branco found out rapidly that whether in civilian or military life, leaders were expected to process an endless stream of unexpected events. Thankfully, that day's set of news had been a more fortuitous one than usual, for Chile and Peru had gone ahead and declared the birth of a new trade bloc, the Andean Pact. This new voluntary group of nations was intended as an area of lower tariffs and an avenue for better friendship between the region's countries. So thought the president, discussing the news with his foreign minister in the Palácio da Alvorada\n\n"You speak of improving the economy, and furthering our economy, sir. What do you think is America's likeliest reaction to all of this?"\n\nCastelo Branco sighed. "They are our greatest allies in protecting our institutions."\n\n"It's always hard to figure out their thinking."  Magalhães said. "If we join the Andean Pact it might raise a few alarms in D.C. That said, our economic size would likely help us take a leading role in the bloc, and help steer it toward OFN interests whenever the Americans need it. With a bit of hard work we could really make use of this opportunity to strengthen our regional position and impress our allies. Our, ah, friends in the American business community could help us make our case to the D.C. foreign policy wonks.\n\n"Nothing is ever free." Castelo Branco rubbed his temples. "We'll have to convince our own business community. The upcoming president will also have to be made to see things our way, so that he doesn't derail everything. Still, perhaps it's an opportunity...""

LATAM.11.desc: "João never knew how many diplomats smoked like a chimney. The grand hall was practically choked in ashes and haze, forcing him to keep his breaths shallow and quiet, else he choke on the fumes - and he doubted the tense atmosphere needed some secretary breaking into a hacking fit to help relax the tension.\n\nIt seemed his services would be unnecessary as the Pact representatives organized their papers, their leader standing. "The first order of business today," the man stated, peering through his glasses at his agenda, "is to negotiate proper terms for the borders of the Brazilian nation, in relation to the other members of the Pact. Shall we begin?"A quick glance up to the Brazilian delegation, whose leader merely nodded in response, and the man went back to his paper.\n\n"In the interests of our member nations, we must recognize the current state of border infrastructure as quite unsatisfactory, and would work to repair and improve on that. In relation to trade agreements and border restrictions, we request that the Brazilian delegation agrees to renegotiate its deals with our member nations, and relax its limits on Pact nations. . ."\n\nJoão tuned the man out as he began speaking in legalese, forgoing the details as he considered the offer. New trade deals, less border restrictions? A double edged sword, perhaps - cheaper goods at home, but the potential for Brazilian jobs being lost over the border to her neighbors. He knew, however, that some sort of agreement would need to be negotiated on the issue, regardless of integration into the Pact or not.\n\nWhat would Brasilia want?"
LATAM.11.a: "These terms are more than acceptable."
LATAM.11.b: "The border policy is fine, but these trade terms are too much."

Someone had gotten it in their head to open a window, thank God, João would kiss them if he knew who it was, but even then the haze had hardly abated. The only way to keep him focused was a series of key words that he knew would start fires - words like "political integration". By the reaction of the rest of the delegation, he wasn't alone.\n\n"Cooperation on military matters, economic matters, diplomatic coordination." the man continued. "Generally, our integration would be aimed at keeping the members of the Pact united and powerful through cooperation. Perhaps some multinational training exercises, a few diplomatic meetings - keeping each other on the same page." He looked through his glasses at the Brazilians, waiting for their response.\n\nAs João leaned in towards his superior, his mind whirled through possibilities. It made sense, sure, but he couldn't help but remember that neither Chile or Peru had been too enthusiastic about this prospect either. It gave him leeway, at least. He could already picture nationalists back home yelling about loss of sovereignty if they went too far just as easily as he could see those internationalists who had pushed for the Pact in the first place raging about their reluctance.\n\nSomeone's going to have to be upset."

There were only six men in this cramped room, hidden away from the rest of the complex - the Chilean and Brazilian diplomats and their two best aides. It was no small honor that João was here to witness this.\n\n"The elephant in the room?" his superior started, prompting a tired nod from the Chilean. "Of course. It's always the Argentines."\n\n"Always." The other man said. "They're unstable, aggressive, and strong. You know just as well as we do how dangerous they can be. We want cooperation - shared officers, mutual defense agreements, military cooperation-"\n\n"And you left the Peruvian delegation out of this, I see."\n\n"We did, yes. They don't understand it like we do. To them, Argentina is just another nation. We can't risk a security leak like that over something as important as this."\n\n"Indeed." The Brazilian responded. "This is. . .quite an escalation, you know. Buenos Aires would be furious if they figured it out - maybe provoked enough to fight. I must say, my friend, Brazil does not want a continental war on its hands."\n\n"Of course, but that doesn't mean you can simply ignore the threat."\n\nThe diplomat turned to João, and he felt his stomach jump into his throat.

Too many demands, too many sticking points. Eventually, the other parties had tired of their delegation's so-called "intransigence", and had ended the talks.\n\nHe had taken it harshly. It was a failure, after all, and João had not come with the intention of failing. On a lesser scale, it would certainly not be the bright note on his resume that he had hoped for. On the grand scale, of course, it meant Brazil would not be able to reap the potential rewards of the Andean Pact, or cooperate as effectively with its members. What an opportunity they had blown! It almost made him sick thinking about it.\n\nStill, though, they had demanded too much. He soothed his mind with that line of thought. They had asked for too much, and Brazil had no choice but to defend its sovereignty. The nationalists would welcome the delegation back warmly, at least, even if the government would be displeased. It wasn't a good silver lining, but it was something.\n\nStill, as João looked back at the rapidly receding properties, he couldn't help but feel like a real opportunity had been missed.

LATAM.16.desc: "Over 4,000 miles long. Over 400 miles wide. Nearly 14,000 feet tall. The Andes stretch through the beating heart of the Latin world. Now, for the first time since the enforced solidarity wrought by the Viceroyalties of Spain, an extended hand reaches across the mountains. Among the weathered stones of the Pinkuylluna, near the city of Cusco, a group of men shake hands. No negotiations have taken place here (the old storehouse is no place for modern statesmen), but the symbolism of the old capital of the Inca is too great to pass up.\n\n"Goddamn it's cold up here". The Brazilian representative looks out across the ancient fortress-city of Ollantaytambo. At his core, he is deeply moved by the morning mist that fills the sacred valley before him. He is moved by the historicity of the moment, the change in course of Latin American history. He has a strong sense of hope for the future; he truly believes in the power of the Andean Pact. All the same, he is enslaved to machismo and politics - his hope and his passion have no place in international diplomacy - and so, he comments on the temperature and bundles his hands under his arms as a surrogate for emotional depth.\n\n"There is nothing wrong with cool mountain air! It invigorates the body, mind, and soul." The Chilean representative, one would expect, ought to be tied down with the bonds of masculinity far harder than the Brazilian. For this man in particular, on this day, elation has won out over social mores. South America has been hypothetically free for over a century, since the days of Bolívar, and yet it has always been tied to one of the political poles of Earth-- Madrid, London, Germania. Now though, with the Brazilian entry into the Andean Pact all but assured, these nations might begin to walk proud and tall.\n\nThe Brazilian delegation has agreed to work towards a unified Andes, but such a proposal must first pass the Brazilian Congress and through the jaws of Brasilia. To the quiet Peruvian representative, this is merely the first step on a much longer road. He silently prays they do not stumble."

For the majority, however, the decision not to join the pact was met by a sort of muted disappointment. The president's proud announcement that Brazil would take its place as a leading nation in South America had been followed by a defeat speech where the president meekly admitted that the time had not yet come for such a momentous occasion.

Far away from anything as unseemly as public debate, the national congress passed the president's decision just as routinely as it did any other bill. Voices of dissents were of course permitted. The army was not, after all, doing anything out of the constitutional norm. Yet now that it was purged from radical anti-democratic elements, the country's political class generally spoke in one voice. And that voice followed the requests of the president more often than it did not.\n\nThe real debates took place not within the congress, nor within the public, but in the rarefied air of high level military politics and corporate interests. Those officers who felt that Brazil had to gain from joining the Andean Pact had negotiated, cajoled, threatened, bribed and insisted on those who did not. In the end the president's decision had spread to the ranks as a general consensus. Brazil would join the new trade zone, and become its leader.

Worse yet, the APRA remains a threat in the northern regions of his country. Needless to say, the new President has his work cut out for him."

Implicit in the army's command is the threat of a military intervention, were the civilian leaders to fail in solving the crisis.\n\nThe republic left headless after the resignations of President Lott following a corruption scandal over the Trans Amazonian highway, and the following resignation of Vice President Quadros.

Stretching from Brazil's Atlantic coast all the way to Colombia, the Trans-Amazonian Highway has the potential to revolutionize life in Brazil's vast interior. The Highway is by far the largest infrastructure project in Brazil's history, and a signal achievement for the current government.\n\nHowever, this accomplishment has not been met with celebration in all quarters. Some have raised concerns on the impact the project may have on Brazil's indigenous peoples and that the highway has only opened the door to logging.\n\nBut in Brasília, the mood is a festive one.

LATAM_news.17.d: "Today, all eyes of the world are fixed on Chile, as famous revolutionary Che Guevara was released from Santiago Public Prison today. Responsible for agitation and sedition as according to many, President Jorge Alessandri refused to extradite the revolutionary to his home nation of Argentina.\n\nWhile some believe Alessandri to be concerned for his safety, this move also comes in the midst of him attempting to begin a process of Land Reform, so it is believed that this was an attempt to secure support from the Socialist-led FRAP Coalition. Though this may allow for President Alessandri to come closer to his aims, it has also sparked considerable controversy, both locally and abroad. Only time will tell if this move has secured a future for Chile -potentially at the cost of others- or if this is yet another footnote in the long history of Chile's political instability.\n"

Some attendees are highly wanted criminals, and many parties banned in their respective countries are also known to have sent representatives.\n\nWhat also raises concern is the presence of international revolutionary Ernesto Guevara. Following his release from an Argentine prison not so long ago, 'Che' had disappeared from notice, with only hints of a possible exile into Uruguay, and all wonder what his resurfacing might mean."

The result is a domino effect of exploding tensions as extremist groups, armed syndicates, and local landowners enter open battle, leaving local authorities helpless as the region turns into a frenzy of violence.\n\nBeaten by many tragedies and crises in recent years, the country seems to be hastely approaching an abyss. As the aftershocks rip through Chile, one thing is certain: any hopes that the Alessandri administration had of recovering national stability have been snuffed out for good."

LATAM_news.20.d: "The cascading effect of Alessandri's folly continues, as Hugo Zepeda Barrios is inaugurated as President of Chile. A compromise candidate from the Liberal party after the failed Agrarian Reform, Zepeda was reluctantly backed by both centrist and right-wing parties in order to prevent a victory from Allende and the FRAP.\n\nRarely does a figure like Zepeda step into the seat of president. President of the Senate and of the Liberal Party, Zepeda has shown little interest in the executive branch until last year. Uninterested in sweeping reforms, Zepeda has committed to using international trade and federalism to solve the nation's woes, maintaining that personal liberties must be protected - at any cost."

An independent supported by the FDC and much of the center, Philippi ran a campaign that united the right and center in the face of a unified leftist offensive from the FRAP.\n\nAn independent minister dedicated to his various positions, Philippi became well known during the Alessandri administration, where his intense dedication to his various ministries gave him national attention. Philippi has promised to continue the push against partisan struggles, promising an apolitical, technocratic touch as he begins his slate of policies - most importantly, land reform."

Prat's unified right-wing ticket has propelled himself to the highest seat in Chile.\n\nA champion of women's suffrage and a vocal opponent of the FDC, Prat has always been an unusual conservative. Already he has laid out a slate of reforms for Chile, from land reform to Latin American integration, all tinged with his corporatist ideals. Most importantly, he has committed himself to preventing the overreach of Congress with severe regulations over their authority. Whatever he does next, it is clear that Chile is due to change."

Leader of the progressive faction of the Conservatives and vocal supporter of Christian democracy, Frei easily defeated the opposing leftist FRAP after uniting the right and center on a unified ticket.\n\nFrei's plans may not align with the leftists, but he is still very much a reformer. His detailed outlines call for changes to every sector of government, from a reinvigorated agrarian reform to a massive expansion to social services, all in hopes of uplifting the lives of Chile's poor. Whether Frei can get his reforms through congress, a new day is dawning above Santiago."

While Allende has begun to outline his "Chilean Path to Socialism", promising to liberate the nation from "capitalism, foreign exploitation, and bourgeois democracy", the opposition has already begun organizing against him and his supporters.

As with the last time around, he ran as the candidate of the centre-left PSD-PTB coalition.\n\nCompared to his previous accession in 1955, when he had to rely on the support of the military to drive back a coup attempt, there has been a lack of chaos. Observers consider this a indicator of relative stability, unusual given the tumult that surrounds the Brazilian democratic process.\n\nKubitschek, not one to rest on his laurels, is already getting to work. Rumour has it that he will be instituting more of the massive infrastructure and construction programs that were his trademark during the first Kubitschek presidency.\n"

The vice-president in the previous government of President Henrique Lott, he won election as a prominent leader of the conservative UDN.\n\nQuadros, known for his flamboyant and erratic behavior, is a staunch conservative who plans to promote his concept of "traditionalism" in Brazil. He is also a fanatical opponent of corruption and talks frequently of sweeping Brazil clean of corruption, to the point of being popularly known as the "Broom".\n\nEven more important to him than either of these, however, is his plan to establish an independent Brazilian foreign policy, which international observers believe may complicate the Brazilian-American relationship."

Adhemar won office as the leader and linchpin of the populist PSP, which seems to have no policies aside from what he dictates.\n\nIf one were to ask the common Brazilian to describe de Barros, the first thing many of them would come up with is "corrupt". Yet Adhemar is also known for his competence; he leaves behind a trail of deals that benefit those who need it while at the same time lining his pockets and those of his supporters. This is where his nickname, Senhor Rouba-mas-Faz - Mister Steals-but-Delivers - comes from.\n\nMost observers are of the mind that Brazil is in for a "wild ride"; welfare bills are already being drafted and corruption is certain to grow by leaps and bounds during Adhemar's presidency.\n"

Before these concerns could be addressed, he joined hands with allies to usurp control over the Presidency before Goulart could act. Goulart has fled the country, and Lacerda has now walked into the Palácio do Planalto as the President.\n\nThough Lacerda has seized control of the Presidency through undemocratic means, he has pledged to remain faithful to democratic norms while in office, and to "erase the stain of Varguism from Brazil"."

As the sun sets on Election Day, a surprising victor rises from the muck of fraud allegations by all parties- Manuel Seoane, of the APN.\n\nSeoane, himself a former member of the APRA, headed the leftist APN into their first election. Widely expected to place third or fourth, his victory has sent shockwaves through Peruvian politics- never has Peru had a politician like Seoane in her highest office. Though he promises sweeping reform to improve the lives of all Peruvians, it will be difficult for the APN to pass their agenda, as they face hostility from all other parties. Perhaps most worrisome is the eerie silence of the military- yet, it's a good sign that they've even let Seoane in office at all.\n"

LATAM_news.55.desc: "Peru has always been one for chaotic election seasons, and 1963 has proven no exception. As the sun sets on Election Day, a surprising victor rises from the muck of fraud allegations by all parties- Pedro Beltrán, head editor of La Prensa and ex-economic minister.\n\nBeltrán's victory comes as a surprise to many, namely due to his unpopular welfare cuts during his time as economic minister under Prado. However, with the Peruvian economy still sluggish, it seems that the people have had a change of heart on his ideas. However, Beltrán will not go unchallenged- the left has rushed to declare opposition, and internal conflict within Peru only seems to be on the upswing. With the UNO behind him, Peru watches as Beltrán readies his policies- for they can only hope that he is the answer that has long eluded them.\n"

Instead, he and his supporters have found themselves on top. However, Cornejo's vision of a restored, religious Peru faces problems out the gate- conflicts within and without his own party threaten to end his presidency before it even gets going.

However, with a new Congress and new crises both within and without the nation, questions still swirl over whether Paz has the drive to deal with the many problems that plague the nation.

After Prado's assassination tore into what remained of Peru's stability, the election was blown wide open- and after a brutal, mud-slinging affair, Manuel Seoane of the APN emerged the winner among accusations of voter fraud from all sides.\n\nSeoane, a former APRA member, was immediately met with mass controversy by those who believe APRA remnants were responsible for Prado's death, finally culminating in the military issuing a demand for him to renounce his candidacy. Seoane had no choice but to acquiesce, leaving second place finisher Pedro Beltrán as the winner.\n\nNow faced with nationwide chaos, Beltrán looks to have the impossible task of governing a flaming nation ahead of him.

With Argentine and Chilean sources claiming the other side is solely responsible for the clash, it seemed that it was only an inevitability that conflict would break out between the two nations, as clashes continue along the southern border.\n\nWhile considerable forces have moved into the region, and open warfare has begun to rage across the southern valleys, plains and mountains of the border regions, it has become clear that this conflict will be decided by whoever seizes on the initiative. With the inhospitable terrain already leading to aircraft being unable to operate for extended periods of time given the lack of operable airfields, it seems as though this is a conflict that will be decided by the troops on the ground."

Incredibly, their 85-year old candidate Alfredo Palacios spearheaded the charge and came out victorious over the tumultuous coalition of anti-Peronist forces. His age, his socialist ideology, and his fragile alliance has left the new President in an immediately precarious situation, one that will need to be navigated with grace.\n\nEven if he can win over a people who may have more voted against the legacy of Perón than for him necessarily, and even if his age does not prove to be as great an issue as his detractors claim, the shaky grounds his alliance is built on may not last long now that the immediate threat has passed."

In the multifactional brawl that was the 1963 election, the electoral college has selected its victor in Emilio J. Hardoy. Nearly a quarter of all votes cast in this election were blank, protest votes in support of Perón or Frondizi rather than any of the assorted candidates that were actually present on the ballot.\n\nThe Argentine people have made their displeasure known in scattered protests and demonstrations throughout the country, but none have more displeasure than Argentina's military, who remain incredibly wary of their Pro-Colorado Head of State.

Several days later, the appointment as President of the virtually unknown General Roberto Marcelo Levingston, military attache in the U.S.A, was announced.\n\nLevingston, recognized by a few as an Ultracatholic intelligence officer, raised eyebrows by immediately forcing the appointment of known leftists to his cabinet, including the left-nationalist Aldo Ferrer as Minister of Economics. Indeed, it has become clear from this, and the strong support his government has received from Oscar Alende, that the President is now engaged in an ideologically-inclusive nationalist crusade against the very junta that appointed him.\n"

LATAM_news.91.desc: "The weary and apathetic Argentina population was met with the news today that their country has been subjected to another coup, and the brief interlude of President Roberto Levingston come to an ignominious end. In his place, Alejandro Lanusse, long recognized as the strongman of the Argentine Army, has installed himself as President. The move, made in the context of an increasingly unstable political situation and a spate of terrorist attacks, is certain to further destabilize Argentina.\n\nRecognizing the inevitability of elections, Lanusse has made it clear he intends to call them. It is not yet clear, however. Indeed, he seems determined to be a candidate in them, possibly against Juan Perón himself, whose candidacy has not been preemptively ruled out by the Military."

LATAM_news.93.desc: "A shocking development in the Southern Cone as José Ignacio Rucci, the recently elected vice president of Argentina was shot in Buenos Aires. Rucci, a prominent right-wing trade unionist and close associate of President Juan Domingo Perón, was ambushed while leaving his home and gunned down by submachine gun fire.\n\nWhile no group has claimed responsibility, it is an open secret that the perpetrators were a group of left-wing Perónists, the Montoneros. It appears that Rucci's death is in reaction to Perón continuing to ignore the demands of the Montoneros. While they have Perón's attention, any hope of their demands being met was squashed after the president gave an address to the nation, saying that the assassins "payback will thunder" across all of Argentina."
