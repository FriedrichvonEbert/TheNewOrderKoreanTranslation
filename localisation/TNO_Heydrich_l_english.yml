 POLITICS_REINHARD_HEYDRICH_DESC:0 "하이드리히에게는 여러 이름이 있습니다. 금발의 야수, 프라하의 도살자, 젊고 사악한 사신. 세계 대전 당시 있었던 암살 시도에서 가까스로 살아난 하이드리히는 부하들이 과거 체코슬로바키아였던 땅에서 수천 명을 추적하고 쓸어버리는 일을 개인적으로 도왔습니다. 자신이 이뤄낸 폐허와 잔해 위에 위풍당당하게 선 그의 사진은 전쟁 내내 독일의 선전 자료로 쓰였습니다. 괴벨스마저 (마지못해서 했다지만) 이 일을 가지고 선전 영화를 찍을 정도였죠.\n\n하지만 이제 하이드리히는 훨씬 더 사악한 대의를 위해 일합니다. 인형사에게 조종받는 인형사인 그는 부르군트 SS의 SS국가지도자 하인리히 힘러가 독일과 해외에 대해 가진 의지를 충족하기 위해 암흑의 실에 얽매여 앞뒤로 까딱거립니다.\n\n충직하며 두려움 받는 부르군트의 하인이지만, 많은 이들은 그의 주인이 취하는 멸시에 가까운 태도를 눈치챘습니다. 하이드리히는 아무 상관 없이 따릅니다. 이런 행동은 아첨꾼이자 예스맨이라는 평판을 불러일으켰습니다. 물론 그의 면전에서 이런 말을 할 배짱이 있는 사람은 없습니다."
 POLITICS_REINHARD_HEYDRICH_ROGUE_DESC:0 "얼마 전까지만 해도 모든 것이 간단하게 보였습니다. 라이히는 타락의 바다 속에서 허우적거리며 구원자를 찾고 있었습니다. 히틀러의 사상을 배신한 자들은 각자의 깃발을 세우고 고루한 보수주의, 계집애같은 자유주의, 천박한 군국주의라는 이름으로 전 유럽의 인간말종을 불러들였습니다. 라인하르트 하이드리히만이 진짜 중요한 것을 위해 일어났습니다. 하이드리히와... 그의 부르군트 후원자만이.\n\n하지만 그게 아니었습니다. 하이드리히가 싸웠던 대의는 거짓된 것이었습니다. 핵 홀로코스트로 세계를 정화하려는 힘러의 진짜 목표를 숨기려는 위장에 지나지 않았습니다. 독일이 간절히 원했던, 모든 퇴락과 나약함을 없앨 퓌러의 길고 평화로운 치세는 없습니다. 힘러의 정신 나간 계획 때문에 조국은 다른 모든 이들처럼 불탈겁니다. 이는 독일이 상상할 수 있던 어떤 적들도 이루지 못한 성과입니다.\n\n힘러의 배신은 신질서를 뒤집어 엎었습니다. 이는 하이드리히가 지금까지 믿어온 모든 것을 의심하게 만들었습니다. 그렇지만 총통은 짖지 않습니다. 언제나 그래왔듯 해야 할 일을 할겁니다. 아리아 인종을 위해. 독일을 위해. 전 인류를 위해. 라인하르트 하이드리히는 부르군트를 파괴하고 반역자 국가지도자의 미친 열망을 끝내고야 말겁니다."
 POLITICS_HEYDRICH_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "라인하르트 하이드리히는 독일과의 용맹스런 투쟁 도중 의문의 암살자에게 당하여 서거하셨습니다. 독일 SS 국가지도자의 사망과 함께 SS 도박판 전체가 위험에 빠졌으며 하이드리히의 군대를 지원하러는 부르군트의 관심은 하이드리히의 사망과 함께 사라진 것 같습니다. 지휘 체계가 붕괴하기 시작하면서 각 집단지도자들이 힘싸움을 벌이기 시작하고 필사적인 최후의 저항을 하면서 독일 SS 내부의 중앙집권적 권위는 완전히 무너졌습니다."
 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC_HGR:0 "오스트파리스의 조용한 벙커에서 국가지도자는 분노에 씩씩거립니다. 하지만 계획이 망가지지는 않았습니다. 잠시 연기되었을 뿐입니다. 곧 이 소란이 처리되면 힘러는 진짜 중요한 일로 돌아갈 수 있을겁니다.\n\n정말 실망스러운 일입니다. 힘러는 살아오며 누구를 진심되게 믿어본 적이 없었습니다. 하이드리히는 처음으로 열정을 가지며 그 계획을 실핸한 인물이었습니다. 처음에는 라인하르트 하이드리히처럼 순수한 유전자를 가진 자라면 이 행동이 필요한 일이라는걸 이해했으리라 생각할겁니다. 하지만 전혀 그렇지 않았습니다. 유감스럽게도 하이드리히의 아리아인 성질은 피부 뿐인걸로 보입니다. 그 속에는 슬라브인이나 유대인보다도 나쁜 음모나 꾸미는 겁쟁이 반역자가 있으니까요.\n\n그렇지만 하인리히 힘러는 똑똑한 사람입니다. 그 쥐새끼나 그 공범들보다도 똑똑하죠. 독일 전역에서 국가지도자의 비전을 믿는 진정한 아리아인들이 반역에 맞서 일어났습니다. 이들이 거짓을 위해 싸우는건 중요하지 않습니다. 중요한 것은 이들이 독일을 SS 통치 밑에 놓기 위해 싸운다는거죠. 힘러의 비전이 장대한게 다행일지도 모릅니다. 하이드리히가 내놓는 증거가 헛소리처럼, 심지어는 공상처럼 보이니까요. 사람들이 그걸 믿었다면 하이드리히와 함께 주사위를 던질지도 모르는 일입니다.\n\n아니, 아니. 힘러가 우위입니다. 언제나 갈팡질팡하는 상대들보다 우위였죠. 드레스덴에서는 페겔라인이 힘러 지지 방송을 하며 사람들을 끌어모읍니다. 단치히에서는 바르비가 반역자 놈의 움직임과 계획을 유심히 보며 오스트-파리스에 중요한 정보를 넘겨줍니다. 엘자스에서, 티롤에서, 베스트펠란에서, 동프로이센에서, 로타링기아에서 충직한 이들이 이 반란을 깨부술 준비를 하고 있습니다. 뤼네부르크의 군국주의자 잔당들과 슐레지엔의 경영주들은 충직한 자들을 지원합니다. 부르군트에서 랑게마르크와 샤를마뉴가 질서 회복을 위해 이동하고 있습니다. 곧 힘러의 영광스러운 정복에 합류할겁니다. 힘러는 무슨 수를 쓰더라도 하이드리히와 그 보잘 것 없는 반란을 꽉 쥘겁니다.\n\n이제 해야 할 일은 최선의 패를 내놓는 것 뿐입니다. 마침내 힘러는 자신을 막아서는 중개인을 죽여버릴 수 있습니다. 그리하면 목표가 완수될 것입니다."

One benefit of such status is that any power struggle within the Reich has ripple effects across the globe. When Heydrich rose against the usurper Himmler, the whole of humanity stood to watch the clash of the Spartans. Some of those spectators may be persuaded to support the correct side.\n\nHeydrich is desperately in need of any ally he can get, Aryan or not, German or not. Those allies, acquaintances, and even enemies of Germany who hold Himmler in contempt, may be one of his only chances of success. One day, long in the future, Heydrich and his successors will establish a truly eternal and global Reich. Now, however, true National Socialists must battle to maintain the world they will one day rule."

As the arch-didact of National Socialism, it is he alone who can decide who is and is not Aryan. Purity comes in many forms: sometimes physical, sometimes mental, sometimes spiritual. Though there is obviously still a clear line between 'Aryan' and 'non-Aryan', the matter of 'honorary Aryan' is a different matter entirely. It is a great honor indeed, and the potential to earn it may rest in any man's heart, should he prove willing and noble enough..."

 HGR_a_dark_wave_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS have endured tremendous casualties fighting for the Führer, but this has not weakened them. Quite the contrary; with every one of their number who dies at enemy hands, they find one more reason to continue fighting. They have become inured to pain and hardship, even more so than before the war began. The fact that many are non-Germans and are fighting their so-called 'oppressors' might also be a factor... but such worries are for lesser men. They will always obey in the end."

We simply do not have enough trained recruits to replace their losses without diluting their combat effectiveness. With so many of their best now dead, the SS has transformed from a highly-disciplined modern army to a horde that relies more on weight of numbers than superior training. The Führer has made disparaging comparisons to the Red Army, but they still hold the line, and that is all he would ask of them."

They have little tolerance for the indolence and weakness of civilians, and a culture of brutal elitism has developed following the degradation of their traditions due to casualties. No longer do they wait for reinforcements; instead, their recruits tend to be drawn from the very people they are in the process of liberating. The image of a Waffen-SS squad rounding up the men of a village and forcing them to choose between service or death is a shockingly common one, but this is the Germanic way of war. The people must learn to understand that the Waffen-SS is the true expression of Aryan militarism: harsh, cold and pitiless."

 HGR_the_commissariat_desc:0 "Keeping such a massive, poorly-organized army in line is incredibly challenging. It is small wonder that the Bolsheviks found it so problematic. Ordinary officers, especially Heydrich's own men, are almost completely unable to exert any control over the Waffen divisions, especially the non-Germans. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formation of a Waffen-SS Kommissar corps. Similar to the National Socialist Leadership Officers, these men will be elevated from their own units and given the power of life and death over officers and enlisted men alike. This way, we shall have reliable political officers who are personally loyal to the Führer and face no language barrier when dealing with the men."

We have noticed that there are somewhat fewer arms flowing in from Burgundy, and we have had to wait an unusually long time for reinforcements.

 HGR_the_game_begins_desc:0 "Nothing is the same anymore. The revelation of Himmler's plan has thrown all that we know into doubt. No longer can we be certain of our race's divine destiny, for our quests and trials over the past thirty years have come to this: the apocalyptic vision of a madman.\n\nBut Reinhard Heydrich is not a man given to hesitation. The new Führer is sworn to the defense of Germany and the Aryan race above all else. The deranged Reichsführer will be dealt with in the same manner as all of our foes - with ruthlessness, cunning and strength beyond compare."
 HGR_all_eyes_on_heydrich_desc:0 "As Führer, the Reich now looks to Heydrich to lead it through this unprecedented crisis. It was Hitler's will that his greatest creation endure, and endure it shall. This challenge will be our greatest yet; de-facto, Greater Germany is riven by strife and carved up into petty fiefdoms, with the Führer's authority existing in name only.\n\nHeydrich must begin to assert himself immediately, but only with great care - the political situation is delicate and we cannot be certain of any man's loyalty at this point. There will be sacrifices, for not every interest can be satisfied, but whatever move we make must be for the greater good."
 HGR_friends_close_desc:0 "No longer united as they once were, the SS is now just another assemblage of personalities which the Führer must contend with. Our old comrades-in-arms run the gamut from true-blooded Aryan ideologues to grizzled soldiers who barely pay lip service to the Reich's ideals.\n\nHeydrich may not be their commanding officer anymore, but Himmler is merely Reichsführer of Burgundy. His influence must be confined to his allocated domain until the time is right to strip it from him entirely. We shall see how true the honor of the SS is."
 HGR_degrelle_gambit_desc:0 "If there is any man of the SS whom Heydrich is willing to trust, it is Leon Degrelle. A loyal collaborator for over thirty years, Degrelle's allegiance has always been to the ideals of Belgian nationalism rather than Himmler. Indeed, his loathing of the Reichsführer is established fact.\n\nSwaying Degrelle will not be difficult at all. If he has a price, it will be the restoration of Belgium - insignificant when weighed against the value of his Walloon Legion. The old Rexist has been sharpening a knife to plunge into Himmler's back for decades, and the Führer shall gladly give him the opportunity."
 HGR_loyalty_to_heydrich_desc:0 "Attempting to sway avowed Himmlerites will likely be a futile endeavor. The Reichsführer has spent nearly forty years building up his personal cabal of fanatics. Most are not so discerning as Heydrich and his comrades of the Deutsche-SS. It might be preferable to cut our losses and find alternate solutions for dealing with the Burgundians.\n\nThe position of the non-Burgundians is strong, at least. Fegelein, Dietrich, Skorzeny and Henlein have all carved out statelets for themselves. Representing the last of the SS truly loyal to Hitler's vision, they are our best hope for bolstering our forces."
 HGR_enemies_closer_desc:0 "It was mere months ago that we had to battle the non-SS factions within the Reich to secure Heydrich's rightful rule. Now we find ourselves without friends or allies, and those same enemies who might have once threatened Himmler are dead, broken or scattered throughout Germany.\n\nSome small hope remains, at least. Certain elements of the Wehrmacht and 'moderate' political groups have survived the Bürgerkrieg and seized territory for themselves. No doubt they intend to try and take advantage of the chaos to overthrow Heydrich. However, these men are realists, and once it becomes obvious that Heydrich is not loyal to Himmler, they will have second thoughts about any existing plans."
 HGR_the_true_soldiers_desc:0 "In times when our ideal society is fraying at the edges, perhaps it needs more than ideologues to save it. There are good men in the SS, true, but their allegiances are ever-shifting. The Wehrmacht, on the other hand, know where they stand; their loyalty is to the Reich, and in principle to the Führer.\n\nIt will not be easy to convince the remaining independent Wehrmacht elements of our good intentions, but we must try. They are the only men in the Reich whom we can be certain are not compromised by Himmler."
 HGR_contact_the_guerillas_desc:0 "Aside from the militarists, many Speerites and Bormannites have survived the civil war. With their leaders gone, they have rallied to the banner of Reinhard Gehlen, former head of Fremde Heeres Ost. Though Gehlen is a sly and egotistical usurper, these civilians do lend a certain degree of legitimacy to his supposed authority.\n\nThe civilians can hang for all the Führer cares - they are still traitors, after all. Gehlen, on the other hand, would be an invaluable asset owing to his decades of intelligence work and continent-spanning connections. He might be the sole individual in Europe capable of matching Himmler's operatives.\n\nAdditionally, to our north, the famed 1st Panzergrenadier Division 'Berserker' continues to hold out in Pomerania. They have aggressively fought off both our forces and those of neighboring factions. Hitler's legendary sword and shield might serve Heydrich just as well."
 HGR_the_pretenders_desc:0 "Reinhard Gehlen refers to his little statelet simply as the 'Deutsches Reich', as if the Führer simply did not exist. Quite the grandiose assertion, considering that his 'Reich' is by all accounts a chaotic mess. Mass panic is the order of the day, since Gehlen's meager forces are obviously not sufficient to hold off the surrounding SS fiefs. What the intelligence chief controls is little more than a glorified refugee zone with the SS flags taken down.\n\nStill, Gehlen's claims hold no water, and are therefore not anything to be unduly concerned about. He poses no military threat, so we can deal with him at our leisure - though it should be soon, before his lack of a substantial army makes him a tempting target for Himmler."
 HGR_appeal_to_gehlen_desc:0 "Unusually for an intelligence officer, Gehlen has a reputation as a pompous braggart. Somehow, this has never been a problem for him, as during the past decade he regularly ran rings around Heydrich's SS. Even the Führer admits he is impressed.\n\nGehlen has a deep-seated hatred for the SS, and especially for Himmler - this will be the key to bringing him on board. Doubtless he already knows about the split in the SS, so the main focus must be on showing him the wisdom of an alliance against Himmler, for the sake of Germany. "
 HGR_battle_of_wits_desc:0 "Gehlen is an arrogant fool. He continues to play his egotistical power games, even as Himmler plots the destruction of our nation, our race and the entire world. The Führer has no interest in indulging that snake's vices just to groom his ego. The time has come to end Gehlen's puppet show once and for all.\n\nWe have retained a coterie of loyal and experienced spies, veterans of many decades in the Gestapo and SD. No matter his reputation, Gehlen is not omniscient - he has a weakness, and it will be found."
 HGR_an_offer_he_cant_refuse_desc:0 "Ultimately, despite his many, many, many flaws, Gehlen is a patriot. He has opposed the SS constantly throughout his career, but not once did he act against Hitler or his own country. We can use these admirable qualities to our ends.\n\nHe might not be a man of honor, but he is a man of common sense. He would have happily worked for any of the other claimants to the Führership; we simply need to demonstrate that Heydrich is no less trustworthy than they were. Turning over our liberal and conservative prisoners to him would be a good start."
 HGR_building_our_network_desc:0 "It will not be enough to simply send our spies into the 'Reich' and expect them to succeed; they will need supplies, lines back to Germania, and armed support. Gehlen doesn't have his precious FHO or the Abwehr to play with anymore - he is but one man, and we have many.\n\nOnce our agents inveigle themselves into the 'Reich', we will prepare a coup to remove Gehlen and integrate 'his' lands directly into our own. Soon he shall have nowhere left to run - and then we will squash that damned spider."
 HGR_last_of_the_militarists_desc:0 "With the Reichsmarschall no longer present as a figurehead, the militarist clique within the Wehrmacht disintegrated, as expected. Ultimately, they turned out to be sheep in wolves' clothing, not leaders or strategists. They have been thoroughly routed by the SS, and no longer pose a threat to world peace.\n\nExcept for one, that is: Otto Ernst Remer, a vicious little rat with delusions of grandeur. By far the most radical militarist in the Reich, Remer has always advocated for war as an end in itself. Now he'll have his chance - truly, a war to eclipse all others."
 HGR_the_true_motive_desc:0 "It has been said that Remer loves war. He loves blitzkriegs, skirmishes, bombing campaigns, submarine warfare - everything. However, every man has limits to his passion. Himmler's nuclear war will be the last ever fought on Earth. In the space of mere hours, billions will perish for nothing.\n\nRemer might be bloodthirsty, but he is not insane. If we expose Himmler's plan immediately, we will decisively pull him into our camp."
 HGR_the_unlikeliest_of_dissenters_desc:0 "The split within the militarist camp has driven even its most hardcore followers apart. Our agents report that a manhunt is underway within Remer's territory for Ferdinand Schörner, once their de-facto leader. It appears that the field marshal's failure in the Bürgerkrieg has pulled the rug out from under him.\n\nSchörner may be a wanted man now, but the militarists would follow anyone with the strength to lead them. If we can find him, secure him and remove Remer from power, his supporters would rally again. Furthermore, his hatred of the SS defines him; he will ally with us in a heartbeat if it means bringing Himmler down."
 HGR_backlash_desc:0 "As expected, Remer has finally shown his good sense. Not even he wishes to see his homeland engulfed in atomic fire, even if it would forever destroy the Jewish plutocrats and subhuman barbarians.\n\nNow we shall begin working towards the integration of Remer's territory, along with his substantial forces. The steely discipline and unbridled ferocity of the militarists will be a match even for Burgundy's best."
 HGR_new_face_at_the_head_desc:0 "Our influence in Remer's territory is pervasive now, and his forces are on the back foot. Soon we shall be able to strike a decisive blow, decapitating the militarists and allowing Schörner to resume his leadership.\n\nKnowing the 'monster in uniform', the process will involve a fair few shootings, but who will miss Remer's toadies?"
 HGR_the_three_armies_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS - the strong right arm of the Führer since 1939. When the gods of war called, it was the legions of the Waffen who were first to answer, always at the vanguard of Germany's conquests. Most importantly, they are quite... uninvolved in politics, simply put. They never had time for Himmler's skullduggery. Their mercenary tendencies are concerning, but their value as soldiers remains undiminished.\n\nSwaying the Waffen will hopefully not be difficult at all. Heydrich is well-respected among the officers and enlisted men alike."
 HGR_KSS_Gille_desc:0 "Favorable news: the SS 'Kommandostab' has fallen under the control of the Führer's close ally and head of national security, Herbert Otto Gille. This completely negates the need to fight for the loyalty of the Waffen-SS, as any opposition to Heydrich can simply be expunged by their commander with the state's blessing.\n\nMoreover, Gille is unquestionably loyal to Heydrich, one of the few men of whom that can be said. Once upgunned and properly equipped, his forces will be a valued addition to our collection. Undercutting Himmler by denying him control of the Kommandostab couldn't have been easier!"
 HGR_KSS_Stadler_desc:0 "Sylvester Stadler is somewhat enigmatic in his motives - concerning, as he is now de-facto ruler of the 'Kommandostab'. Though he served Heydrich ably during the Bürgerkrieg and has demonstrated no open disloyalty, he is representative of the politically unreliable nature of the Waffen-SS.\n\nWe must assess Stadler's character and motives carefully before trying to bring him onto our side. He might readily defect to Himmler if the traitor makes a suitable offer. On the other hand, buying his loyalty with a steady supply of arms will be no more difficult for us than for Himmler."
 HGR_KSS_Hausser_desc:0 "The situation in the so-called 'Kommandostab' has not developed to our advantage. Paul Hausser, the Himmler-aligned former commander of the 'Das Reich' division, has taken the reins of power and is leading the Waffen in a distinctly Burgundian direction.\n\nHausser will never join us; he is extremely political, and no doubt sees kowtowing to Himmler as the best way to advance his career, regardless of the Reichsführer's treason. It will be necessary to remove Hausser from his position and replace him with our own man before Himmler can assert control of the Kommandostab."
 HGR_brothers_in_arms_desc:0 "If we can be sure of Stadler's loyalty, we will possess a powerful asset. His service record speaks for itself, so it is not surprising that he came to control the Kommandostab. Notably, he excels in the suppression of partisans and unruly civilian populations, as his men so ably demonstrated to the damnable French.\n\nOf course, Stadler and his men will expect due payment for their services. Proper ideology has somewhat abandoned them in recent years - but they remain excellent soldiers all the same."
 HGR_allies_through_thick_and_thin_desc:0 "As a battalion commander in the 5th SS Panzer Division 'Wiking', Gille proved himself to be one of the Waffen's most able commanders. His multinational unit of Aryan soldiers smashed the Bolsheviks aside with ease, demonstrating the greatness inherent in their blood.\n\nIt is that legacy of triumph which Gille will bring to the fight against Himmler. Where the traitor will have to rely on weak-spirited toadies, Heydrich shall have an iron-backed unit of immortals beside him!"
 HGR_march_to_our_drum_desc:0 "With Hausser deposed, it will be possible to integrate the Kommandostab into our command structure. The Burgundische-SS will have to be purged in the same manner as their commander - unfortunately, this will leave the Waffen somewhat weakened.\n\nA sad turn of events, but at least something of value can be salvaged from the remaining men. Though their numbers may be diminished, their fighting spirit and martial traditions will live on."
 HGR_sons_of_sudeten_desc:0 "As the first conquest of the Third Reich, ownership of the Sudetenland will be integral to our legitimization efforts. The de-facto ruler of the area now is Konrad Henlein, leader of the old Sudetenland NSDAP. He has proclaimed a new movement, the 'Aryan People's Front', and renewed the defunct Lebensborn program to try and outbreed the remaining non-Aryan population in central Europe.\n\nHenlein and Heydrich have had a turbulent past; it was at one point necessary for our Führer to carry out a purge of the former's organization, an incident which he has been stewing over for twenty years now. This perverse little parasite is at least loyal to National Socialist ideals, and should prioritize them over servitude to Himmler. Burgundy's grip on him can easily be loosened, and the resources of the Sudetenland turned to our ends."
 HGR_through_himmlers_eyes_desc:0 "Henlein leans toward Himmler, but that can be remedied. Little does he know that in recent years, Himmler's definition of 'German' has tightened dramatically, and the Sudeten Germans are no longer considered pure under Burgundian standards.\n\nHenlein is a born follower and will defect the moment he knows his chosen leader is unworthy. Such mercurial men have their uses."
 HGR_lebensraum_for_lebensborn_desc:0 "Henlein's initiative in restarting the Lebensborn program is most admirable. The propagation of Aryan seed is always a noble goal. There are, perhaps, some... objections to aspects of his management, but those can be set aside for now. Morals are silent in times of war, as the saying goes.\n\nMore importantly, Henlein has a program; his leadership capabilities have been demonstrated. Bohemia-Moravia is in need of a new Reichsprotektor, and Henlein is just the man for the job. A loyal National Socialist, well-versed in dealing with Czechs: a man after Heydrich's own heart."
 HGR_burying_the_hatchet_desc:0 "Heydrich and Henlein have never quite seen eye to eye. The former, being an excellent judge of character, correctly assessed Henlein's weaknesses and unreliability in the 40s and sought to remove him from his post. Though Hitler rejected that move, Henlein has retained his grudge - stubborn as a Slav, that one.\n\nStill, the past is the past, and the future calls out with dire warnings for the Reich. If Henlein is truly loyal to our shared ideals, he will set aside his personal vendetta and fall in line."
 HGR_into_the_fold_desc:0 "For years, Heydrich ruled Bohemia-Moravia with an iron fist, squeezing blood from the body of the Czech nation until it turned pale and cold. It is thanks to him, our great Führer, that Czech culture is no more, and each generation of the Aryan survivors will grow up more German than their forebears.\n\nWhat was once Czech is now German - now, and forever. It's time to bring our new brothers home, and secure the industry and agriculture of Bohemia-Moravia for the Reich. We shall send forth the Volksfront and assert absolute dominance over what is rightfully ours."
 HGR_an_old_friend_desc:0 "Joachim Peiper - leader of the 'Blowtorch Battalion'. No other man so embodies the ruthless drive of the SS. His bloody, uncompromising command has made him few friends, but plutocrats and Bolsheviks alike have learned to fear him.\n\nWere he an enemy, we would have cause for concern - but Peiper and the Führer are old friends. There could still be some hurdles in the way, but bringing the Kampfgruppe to our side will be no trouble at all."
 HGR_no_time_to_chat_desc:0 "Sad that it must come to this, but Heydrich is not called 'the man with the iron heart' for nothing. His friendship with Peiper is inconsequential if it could get in the way of saving the world from nuclear armageddon.\n\nWere the roles reversed, Peiper would do the exact same thing: swift and uncompromising strong-arm tactics. No matter their reputation, soldiers must learn to follow orders without question. He did it for Himmler once; now, let him do it for his Führer!"
 HGR_seat_at_the_table_desc:0 "How could the Führer have anything but respect for Peiper? He is a man who has proven his absolute loyalty to the Reich by word and deed, time and again. He is the physical manifestation of the SS' martial ethos.\n\nWe shall approach him as a benevolent superior officer, not an aloof dictator. Peiper deserves fair treatment for his decades of service, no matter what disagreements we might find now. Harsh demands will not lure him down from his alpine fortress."
 HGR_sever_the_line_desc:0 "If Peiper suspects that we are making moves against him, he is sure to defect to Himmler without hesitation. Perhaps he should have chosen his position a little more carefully, however - the Alps are lacking in infrastructure, including lines of communication.\n\nIf we shut those down, Himmler will be left with a blind spot in the region. By the time his agents reach out, Peiper will, ideally, have been strong-armed into servitude. A blunt move, but necessary."
 HGR_trip_to_the_nest_desc:0 "Let it be known that Heydrich is not so aloof that he will refuse to meet his subordinates. He is no Bormann, lording over the Reich from the comfort of his office - he is more than willing to descend from the Reich Chancellery to handle affairs with his own two hands.\n\nLet Peiper see our intentions for himself. He is a simple soldier, able to appreciate a leader who takes the initiative. In this, Heydrich is ten times the man Himmler could ever hope to be, and Peiper will know it!"
 HGR_contacts_in_burgundy_desc:0 "At Himmler's back stand the collaborator legions of the SS: Charlemagne and Langemarck. Unlike Degrelle and the Walloons, their loyalty to Himmler is a little more concrete - but they still have their own interests, which the Reichsführer's goals are quite incompatible with.\n\nCoercion, bribery, and promises of independence should be sufficient to get us in the good graces of de la Mazière or Eriksson. Surely they would prefer an... 'equal' relationship to continued servitude?"
 HGR_ss_division_charlemange_desc:0 "Descended from the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and the Tricolor Legion, the Charlemagne division has a reputation for fanatical devotion to National Socialist ideology. This is admirable, but their service record is less so. They performed poorly on the Ostfront, largely being relegated to partisan suppression.\n\nIn that role, they have performed well enough, and their numbers swelled after the formation of Burgundy. Weight of numbers could put considerable pressure on the Ordensstaat's western border - we should court them promptly."
 HGR_ss_division_langemarck_desc:0 "Much more successful in combat than their French comrades, the Flemish of the Langemarck division acquitted themselves well during the siege of Leningrad. They stood in the face of countless Bolshevik attacks, casting aside the misaimed blows of the Red Army with the same skill as the best German units.\n\nLangemarck's commander, Bert Eriksson, is not as impressive as his legion, being young and relatively inexperienced. His fear of Degrelle and de la Mazière is obvious. But we don't ask for him - we ask for his soldiers."
 HGR_no_hope_under_the_black_sun_desc:0 "Ultimately, our greatest asset in the subversion of the SS legions will be the revelation of Himmler's goals. Not the nuclear war - though knowledge of that might help - but the total eradication of national identities within the Ordensstaat. Degrelle, Eriksson and de la Mazière operated under the assumption that they would be part of a pan-European brotherhood, but Himmler betrayed that vision long ago.\n\nThe truth must be disseminated among their ranks. Even if they eventually refuse to fight for us, keeping them out of Himmler's clutches is a victory in itself."
 HGR_morals_mean_nothing_desc:0 "The only thing more despicable than a subhuman is a treasonous subhuman. Against all reason, the slaves of east Prussia have risen up and seized a portion of Germany's sacred land! Jews, Poles, Russians and a dozen other varieties of subhuman now control a key agricultural area along with the proud Aryan city of Königsberg!\n\nAnd yet... we hesitate. These barbarians are the most vicious enemies of the Germanic race imaginable, brutalized by years of enslavement and extermination. Speidel, that deluded fool, thinks they might contemplate entering into an... arrangement with us.\n\nDamn you, Himmler, for what we must do."
 HGR_send_in_speidel_desc:0 "Allying with the slaves was Speidel's idea. Therefore, negotiations will fall to him. The Führer will have no truck with subhumans, no matter their use. Failing that, we'll send someone else - anyone who isn't Heydrich.\n\nThe Führer must retain some dignity, after all."
 HGR_the_talk_desc:0 "So, it's come to this. The leader of the 'Children of Spartakus', as they arrogantly call themselves, this... Piechowski - wishes to meet with Heydrich himself.\n\nInsolent Polish rat. To degrade the honor of the Aryan race like this - we should be meeting as master and slave!\n\nIf it must be done, then we have no choice."
 HGR_approach_the_pilots_desc:0 "Johannes Steinhoff is no friend of the SS, but he is one of the Reich's greatest flying aces and a lauded commander of the Luftwaffe. With most of the surviving Luftwaffe and a sizeable Heer contingent, he has established a base in Regensburg in a desperate attempt to survive.\n\nSteinhoff's people are hemmed in by the SS and crying out for a savior; that savior could be Heydrich. Would it not be right and just for the Führer to protect them from the predations of traitors and madmen alike? Steinhoff would be obliged to display gratitude in such a case..."
 HGR_good_of_the_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The best way to win over Steinhoff is by providing what he needs. He is short on fuel, ammunition, spare parts and manpower - all things that we can give him in exchange for an alliance. As a pragmatic man, he is unlikely to turn us down, especially given his empathy for the people under his care.\n\nThis tactful approach will cost us time and resources, but will pay off in the long run. The more the Führer shows his generous side, the more likely people are to believe it truly exists. That would be most useful."
 HGR_good_of_germany_desc:0 "We have no interest in Steinhoff's pitiable excuses. He knows the stakes, that without us he and everyone under his wing is doomed. If he refuses our help, he has no future. We need to make that fact abundantly clear to him.\n\nWe are not without mercy, however. We shall supply the Luftwaffe with what they need, but only once their loyalty is certain. Just to be sure, our men will have to move into Regensburg to keep watch on them. Steinhoff will not object."
 HGR_refuel_and_rearm_desc:0 "With arms and fuel flowing to them, the Luftwaffe remnants will become a potent force again. Burgundy lacks a substantial amount of air power, so when combined with our own forces the Luftwaffe will constitute a significant advantage in our favor.\n\nThe ability to strike the traitor in his home should not be underestimated. There is little glory in bombing fellow Aryans, but it must be done - just another sacrifice of blood and ash upon the altar of victory."
 HGR_stable_and_secure_desc:0 "Perhaps it would be of more benefit to actively assist the Luftwaffe, but now is not the time for a light touch. Assuming absolute control of Steinhoff's territory is necessary for the good of the Reich. His forces cannot stand against us - he will fold the moment we start putting the pressure on, so we shall no longer need to worry about an opportunistic attack.\n\nIt is good that such heroes exist. They are most pliable."
 HGR_herr_donitz_desc:0 "Grand Admiral Dönitz has made his 'triumphant return' from Crimea now that the dust has settled. Not that he is here to offer loyalty - in fact, we are not certain of what he intends to do. Despite being an avowed Bormannite, it seems he is not here to contest Heydrich's rule.\n\nOur sources claim that he is conducting some kind of rescue operation near the border with Denmark. Indeed, many refugees have been fleeing north, causing no shortage of trouble for us. Stemming the flow might make things easier on us. On the other hand, they are still citizens of the Reich, and deserving of protection. Aiding them might be the key to forging an alliance with Dönitz."
 HGR_the_reich_needs_no_heroes_desc:0 "Heydrich and the SS are the only protectors the Reich needs. Dönitz is a relic of times gone by, a man out of time. Heroes cannot save the Aryan race in these dark days - it takes one monster to slay another. That is the fate Heydrich accepted long ago.\n\nThe refugee columns must be halted and forced to remain in our territory. We need the manpower and resources. Let them hate us for it; we ask not for their love, only their obedience."
 HGR_reclaim_the_fleet_desc:0 "Regardless of our political disagreements, Dönitz is a hero of the Reich. He may not be of the SS, but it was his leadership and tactical genius that allowed the Kriegsmarine to achieve final victory over the fleets of perfidious Albion.\n\nLet us assist the Grand Admiral with his rescue operation. Saving Aryan lives is more important than political games, especially if it earns us the Kriegsmarine's loyalty."
 HGR_back_to_crimea_desc:0 "Begone, Dönitz - we have no need of you here. Take your little fleet, and whatever refugees you have, and flee. Whether you sink in the Atlantic or find sanctuary with our enemies matters not.\n\nIn his wake, we shall be able to reclaim Schleswig-Holstein and the ports of Kiel and Hamburg. Having a strong coastal presence will assist with the movement of men and supplies, and Hamburg possesses a considerable amount of industry as well."
 HGR_rule_the_waves_desc:0 "Once Dönitz swears allegiance to Heydrich, we will be able to make full use of the Kriegsmarine's capabilities to win the war. Notably, they will be able to bring in supplies from anyone outside the Reich who cares to assist us.\n\nMore importantly, Burgundy's navy is no match for ours. Keeping their submarines and convoy raiders at bay will be tremendously helpful, as will the ability to bombard coastal positions from afar."
 HGR_the_work_goes_on_desc:0 "It is good that the natural order of things has survived in Silesia - or a form of it, at least. Karl Hanke and his assortment of capitalist swine are not ideal leaders for National Socialism, but if they continue to run the factories and keep the slaves in their place, they will suffice.\n\nNow, we must assume control of Silesia ourselves, by any means necessary; it is one of the Reich's most important industrial zones. Securing those mines and factories for the Führer might give us the edge we need to match Burgundy's arms production."
 HGR_corporate_power_desc:0 "Though true National Socialism as envisaged by Heydrich would be free from capitalist interference, we must tolerate the industrial cartels for now. We can dismantle them later - right now, we need their managerial expertise to keep the arms factories running.\n\nIG Farben, Reichswerke, Daimler-Benz and Siemens all have a presence in Silesia. We should entreat them to support us against Himmler's efforts; we are natural allies, after all. Their money won't be worth anything if it's incinerated by nuclear fire."
 HGR_ss_roots_desc:0 "If we must pick a poison, it will be Karl Hanke. His self-interested actions are concerning, but he is far more trustworthy than his industrialist allies. He maintains a strong ideological line, even if he has given far too much power to the cartels in Silesia.\n\nWe will move in on Hanke and ingratiate ourselves to him, while at the same time reminding him of his past and duties as a member of the SS. It was through us that he was made, and he can be unmade just as readily."
 HGR_open_for_business_desc:0 "By empowering the corporations and bringing them into the fold, we can sideline Karl Hanke. He may be an SS man, but his refusal to immediately swear fealty to Heydrich makes him untrustworthy. The capitalists might be driven by greed, but that makes them controllable.\n\nWe must hope that the cartels do not get wind of our plans for after Himmler is defeated. They will have no place in the new Germany. Or perhaps they are already aware, and plotting against us; whatever the case, we must keep an eye on them."
 HGR_keep_the_workers_working_desc:0 "If we are to keep the Silesian industries loyal, a guarantee of security is necessary. The collapse of central authority in the Reich has brought with it massive slave unrest, curtailed only by the swift and merciless actions of the SS. In some areas, such as Prussia, that has not been enough, and the subjugated peoples of the Reich have openly revolted.\n\nAssigning SS guards to industrial facilities will free up some of Hanke's resources, allowing him to focus on producing more equipment for us. We just need to ensure none of those guns find their way into servile hands..."
 HGR_dietrichts_little_kingdom_desc:0 "Sepp Dietrich, famed Panzer commander, has apparently gone quite mad. He has seized Upper Bavaria and declared himself its duke! His rationale escapes us utterly, but that is irrelevant. What matters is that he is occupying a sizeable piece of the Reich, including prime agricultural land.\n\nDietrich's realm is extremely unstable, and he does not enjoy the luxury of a massive panzer force as he did 20 years ago. However, every gun, every sack of grain and every soldier counts in this conflict; he must be brought to heel."
 HGR_world_all_his_own_desc:0 "Let Dietrich have his piece of Bavaria. There are worse possible rulers for it, are there not? If he can keep the goods flowing and guarantee his support as a commander for our forces, his reign as 'Duke of Bavaria' is acceptable to us.\n\nWhat mad times we live in. Perhaps Josias will declare himself king next?"
 HGR_loyalty_to_the_fuhrer_desc:0 "It is only due to Dietrich's skill as a commander that he is not already dead and dangling from a tree for betrayal of the Fatherland. To claim a noble title and impose anarchy on the birthplace of National Socialism - the hubris alone should be cause enough to put him down.\n\nBut that would be too rash a solution. Now is the time for caution. We can still salvage the situation in Bavaria and offer Dietrich a chance at redemption in the process. First, though, we need to remove that rabble he calls an army..."
 HGR_return_of_the_ss_desc:0 "Dietrich doesn't have much in the way of an army. His 'ordered anarchy' is directed by a roving band of black-clad thugs called the Volkswache, more a loose collection of pro-Dietrich gangs than a true paramilitary.\n\nThis will not do. The Führer, in his stern love for the people, will restore order by sending in the SS military police. With a few shootings and public hangings, we can return the rule of law to Bavaria's verdant fields and forests."
 HGR_prying_eyes_desc:0 "If Dietrich wishes to repent and serve us, he will do so on a short leash. One more word of treason, and he'll be swinging from the nearest tall object by his neck. The Führer will tolerate nothing short of absolute loyalty, even from eccentric madmen.\n\nThe Gestapo will keep a very close eye on Dietrich from now on. He serves at our pleasure, and his service will end only when we permit it - or when he meets death on the battlefield."
 HGR_eyes_to_osterreich_desc:0 "Otto Skorzeny has chosen a curious path for his homeland, seized against the Führer's will. He has chosen neutrality. Utter farce, of course - there are no neutrals in this conflict. We wage a war for the very existence of our world. He must choose: death, or the Fatherland.\n\nIt is fortunate that Skorzeny is a man of reason - clearly, his whims have got the better of him. It falls to the Führer to bring the arch-commando back to his senses and onto the righteous path. First, though, we should probe his defenses - see what's been happening in fair Austria."
 HGR_man_of_dishonor_desc:0 "No force in Europe stands a chance of successfully infiltrating Skorzeny's lands and outsmarting his commandos. He could only be defeated by brute force, which would take an inordinate amount of time.\n\nWe are left only with diplomacy as a viable route. Not the Führer's specialty by any means, but he has a foreign minister for that - and the legitimacy of his office, of course. Skorzeny is a soldier, and will accept Heydrich's command if it seems worthy."
 HGR_die_spinne_desc:0 "It is said that opposites attract. Skorzeny is a man of action - bold, cunning and first to the fight, even if he fights unconventionally. There are others, some of whom might be lured to our service, who are men of subtlety - cautious, quiet and easily underestimated.\n\nPutting Skorzeny in the same room with such a man could spark a dangerous and explosive reaction... or it might make something beautiful. Brutal cunning and razor-sharp intelligence, operating in perfect synchronization, might upend everything Himmler has worked towards."
 HGR_knowledge_from_the_inside_desc:0 "Skorzeny will be one of our most valued servants if we can persuade him to join us. A master of infiltration and sabotage, he is proven as both a strategist and a field commander. Employed properly, his commandos could defeat a force twenty times their size.\n\nAdditionally, he possesses intimate knowledge of Burgundy's terrain and operations protocols. Having that intelligence available to us will subvert Himmler's greatest advantage: information warfare."
 HGR_man_in_the_high_castle_desc:0 "Poor little Klingenberg, all alone in his pathetic excuse for a fiefdom. Fully half of his forces proclaim loyalty to the Führer, while Himmler ignores his naïve efforts to ingratiate himself. Klingenberg is crying out for recognition... or to be crushed.\n\nEither way suits Heydrich. Klingenberg is unworthy of help, let alone respect, but controls a substantial population and industrial base. Additionally, if we support him or depose him, the entirety of his forces will be at our disposal."
 HGR_answer_the_phone_desc:0 "Wewelsburg calls, and Heydrich answers. Klingenberg's fief is tearing itself apart as his SS falls to infighting, while anti-SS partisans harass him endlessly. If the Führer chooses to intervene on Klingenberg's side, it will be a time-consuming but rewarding venture.\n\nThe fact that Klingenberg is of the Deutsche-SS will make him more receptive to us. He is clearly in over his head, and might appreciate deferring his responsibilities to a higher authority."
 HGR_tear_the_castle_down_desc:0 "Why bother helping a feeble, snot-nosed upstart like Klingenberg? He has no high accolades, nor is his loyalty worth anything to the Führer. He thinks himself unassailable in Wewelsburg Castle, but battlements are no match for high-explosive artillery shells, even if they are draped in the black banners of the SS.\n\nWe may not even need to kill Klingenberg, in fact. Wewelsburg is his entire reason for being there, a wretched attempt to appease a man who cares nothing for him. Bring it down, and Klingenberg's will shall crumble as well."
 HGR_the_weak_link_desc:0 "Klingenberg has promised us Wewelsburg in the event of victory. Normally the Führer would turn his nose up at such an offer, but the old SS citadel might contain secrets yet unearthed - weapons to be used against Himmler. It would also aid our legitimacy somewhat.\n\nFor now, however, Westphalia's industry is more important. We will continue to funnel arms and supplies to Klingenberg, with the expectation that he will serve us faithfully when the time comes for battle with Himmler's loyalists."
 HGR_swift_and_efficient_desc:0 "The destruction of Wewelsburg will leave the SS of Westphalia in even more of a panic than before. Paralyzed by indecision and paranoia, Klingenberg will be unable to stop our forces from moving in and asserting dominance over his troops.\n\nAs for the man himself - who cares? Let him run, let him surrender, let him curl up and die. It makes no difference. He can serve if he likes, but only as a tame weasel at our feet."
 HGR_deaths_hand_desc:0 "Heydrich and Eichmann have a long history together. Working in tandem, it was they who truly laid the groundwork for our great cleansing of Europe. Millions of unwanted souls, removed from the world in the name of the master race, are a testament to their joint efficiency.\n\nBut that was long ago. The glory of those times are... in question. More pertinent to our situation is that Eichmann's loyalty lies with Himmler these days. Perhaps it's not too late for him, however. Though currently engaged in a renewed purge of east Prussia, he is also menaced by the slave revolt to his north. Here lies a chance to win him back over to our side - if he is worth the effort."
 HGR_just_like_old_times_desc:0 "Eichmann is both the Führer's old colleague and a dedicated National Socialist; it would be the height of betrayal and foolishness to abandon him in favor of an alliance with rebellious slaves. Our duty is to assist the master of extermination in his endeavor, and reveal to him the true enemy facing us all.\n\nHis forces are small, but fanatical. They have never shirked their duty in the face of death, or shown pity to grovelling cowards begging for their lives. When Himmler kneels in the dirt before us, their bullets will be welcome indeed."
 HGR_cutting_off_the_hand_desc:0 "Eichmann may have been the Führer's comrade in the past, but times are different now. What once seemed like a shared history of nobility is now increasingly uncomfortable to think about. But now is not the time for thoughts of what might have been - there's a battle to win.\n\nHe has thrown his lot in with Himmler, and must pay the price. Nobody who shares in the Reichsführer's treachery can be permitted to live."
 HGR_the_final_hurdle_desc:0 "In the Rhineland lurks Himmler's crippled guard dog, Wilhelm Mohnke. He is an admirably dedicated and hardy defender of the Ordensstaat, but every fiber of his being is dedicated to the protection of Himmler; there is no hope of turning him against his master.\n\nWe will inevitably have to face the Liebstandarte in battle someday, but not before securing the heimat. He is the last obstacle between Germany and Burgundy - we must be as prepared as possible before moving against him."
 HGR_a_simple_request_desc:0 "Though hostilities are inevitable, some of the Führer's advisors have counselled a cautious request: to ask Mohnke to simply allow Heydrich's loyal troops stranded in the area to depart for our territory.\n\nThe Führer is doubtful of Mohnke's acquiescence, but it is possible that he is not yet alerted to Himmler's plans, being a mere crony. If he agrees, it might bolster our manpower somewhat."
 HGR_a_simple_statement_desc:0 "Mohnke has been a problem for long enough. If he will not heed reason, or kneel to his Führer, then it is clear what must be done.\n\nNo man, no problem."
 HGR_a_simple_response_desc:0 ""
 HGR_the_wannabe_desc:0 "The Führer was once adamant that the world could not take a more absurd turn, yet he has been proven wrong once more, for there is now a second Ordensstaat in the world. Theodor Eicke, a man defined by desperation and spite, has proclaimed his new 'Ordensstaat Lothringen'.\n\nWe could simply find a way to eliminate this deluded pawn of Himmler... or perhaps, despite his bitter loathing for Heydrich, the truth will set him free."
 HGR_supporting_subversive_elements_desc:0 "If Eicke wanted to establish a stable imitation of Burgundy, he could have chosen a better location. Weser-Ems and Münster are hotbeds of Speerite resistance, including some particularly radical groups willing to go further even than the SS in the pursuit of victory.\n\nSuch people would normally be our enemies, but who's to say what's 'normal' anymore? If they could help us attain victory, assisting them is not beyond us."
 HGR_no_longer_a_pawn_desc:0 "Eicke might be interested in what the Führer knows of Himmler's plan. For a man so bitter and jaded as Eicke, desperate to prove himself to an uncaring master, to learn that all of it was for nothing - a familiar story to Heydrich.\n\nIt's past time that someone else shared this feeling. Feel it, and learn from it. Have a taste of what true betrayal feels like, you pathetic rat."
 HGR_meinhof_time_desc:0 "Speerite groups in Eicke's territory are not uniformly radical. Less radicals is usually a good thing, but that would not be to our advantage at this time. We need men - and women too, frankly - willing to spill both their blood and Eicke's without hesitation.\n\nWith some propaganda and targeted assassinations, we may be able to drive more civilians into the arms of radical groups and intensify Eicke's problems. Perhaps they'll even dispose of him for us."
 HGR_standing_by_our_side_desc:0 "If Eicke bothers to open his eyes and see the truth right in front of him, we can certainly count on his motivation, if nothing else. Betrayal tends to breed either apathy or fury, and men of the SS are not the apathetic type.\n\nTurning the false Ordensstaat against Himmler will be a cutting blow to his confidence. Eicke is unlikely to know anything of value, but he does possess a decent force, which will in turn be motivated by his desire for revenge against Himmler."
 HGR_eyes_and_ears_desc:0 "The 'Butcher of Lyon', Klaus Barbie, has made his new home in Danzig, where our glorious crusade against the world's degeneracy began in earnest. With his grasp of intelligence and security, he would be a valuable asset - assuming we can pry him from Himmler's grasp.\n\nThe threat Barbie represents is more political than anything else. He will continue to feed information to Himmler so long as the Reichsführer supports him; this leak must be plugged."
 HGR_eyes_closed_desc:0 "Barbie is reliant on the Reich's communications network to remain in contact with Burgundy. Due to his location, most of Barbie's transmissions must pass through Germania's lines - our lines.\n\nAll we need to hamper Barbie's efforts is a pair of wire-clippers and some well-placed jammers. There will be no cry for help to Ost-Paris on our watch."
 HGR_all_bark_and_no_bite_desc:0 "Barbie is a glorified security guard, not a leader of men. His forces are only ever at home mowing down unarmed civilians. When faced with a real challenge, they will scatter like rats before flame, no matter how loudly they bark.\n\nWith the forces we have amassed, Barbie's SS can be crushed at a moment's notice. We will lose a potential ally, but if the benefit is Barbie's removal from the world, that scarcely seems so terrible."
 HGR_ears_shut_desc:0 "Once Barbie's communications are down, Himmler will likely assume that the Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers-SS is lost to him. Subsequently, we expect him to lose all interest in assisting Barbie further. Short attention spans can be such trouble.\n\nIf Barbie is isolated, he will surely recognize the futility of his situation and cede power to the Führer. We can be certain that he has many fascinating things to share with us on the topic of Burgundian operations."
 HGR_city_of_iron_desc:0 "Ernst Kaltenbrunner - now there is a name worthy of respect. He bears the marks of a true Aryan in his scars, and the strength of a true Aryan in his form. With ice in his veins and iron for a spine, there are few allies more desirable in all of the Reich.\n\nIt is unfortunate, then, that he is such an ardent Himmlerite. With a heavy heart, but resolute in our duty, we must snuff out this light of the Aryan spirit so that our race can survive."
 HGR_breaking_the_city_free_desc:0 "The outskirts of Nuremberg have been transformed into a giant concentration camp by Kaltenbrunner. Quite admirable from a technical perspective, but his imprisonment of loyal German citizens is unacceptable, given that it is on the orders of a usurper. The shell of iron encasing the city is strong, but brittle - and we have found a crack.\n\nThere exist thousands of citizens and prisoners of war within the camps surrounding Nuremberg, agitating for freedom, and Kaltenbrunner does not have the numbers to hold them all. Regardless of whether they were allies or enemies during the Bürgerkrieg, their Führer needs them. Let us open weapon smuggling routes, and see what kind of men they are."
 HGR_pressure_from_all_sides_desc:0 "Kaltenbrunner's central position is not sustainable in the event of an attack. Nuremberg was never a militarized city, and the land around it is ill-suited to withstand a siege. If we can surround it and begin applying pressure in the form of blockades and bombardments, Kaltenbrunner can be forced into submission.\n\nWe can only hope that this does not become another Leningrad..."
 HGR_but_it_must_free_itself_desc:0 "When the time comes for the Nuremberg Uprising, the bulk of the fighting will be done by the prisoners rather than our troops. While there may be SS and other loyalist personnel among them, it would be beneficial to weed out the weaklings before accepting them into our army.\n\nOur forces will move in once Kaltenbrunner's SS are fully committed to the battle. Caught in a vice grip, it will be their turn to be imprisoned - in death."
 HGR_a_firm_grip_desc:0 "The noose is set around Kaltenbrunner's neck - time to draw it tight. His supply lines are cut and his men reduced to starvation, so they will be in no condition to fight when our forces blitz Nuremberg and reclaim the spiritual heart of the Reich.\n\nIn an ideal world, Kaltenbrunner might still find the sense to surrender - but this is a clash of iron hearts. Men who understand one another recognize the futility of mercy."
 HGR_enemies_side_by_side_desc:0 "Felix Steiner is an interesting fellow. Devoutly loyal to Hitler and the chain of command, he is a rare example of an SS general respected by the Wehrmacht. As such, he commands both SS and regular forces in his personal domain. His troops are loyal, well-motivated and disciplined - ideal soldiers for the true Führer. If the problem of their infighting can be solved, they could become one of the most potent forces in the Reich.\n\nCrucially, Steiner has rejected Himmler thus far. He is not loyal to Heydrich yet, but we expect him to be very receptive once negotiations open."
 HGR_march_together_desc:0 "Neither the SS nor the Wehrmacht should enjoy primacy under Steiner's command. The Führer wishes for the two branches of our armed forces to cooperate fully without the need for constant disciplinary actions. How many campaigns were sabotaged by the SS refusing to accept the Wehrmacht's position, and vice versa?\n\nThis will be a difficult route, and Steiner will need help to keep his units organized, but only racial unity will lead us to victory."
 HGR_appeal_to_wehrmacht_desc:0 "Recent events have shown us that the SS are never above suspicion. Any one of them could be compromised - the Führer must always keep a close watch on them from now on. Therefore, it would be best if Steiner were to focus on utilizing the Wehrmacht forces at his command.\n\nOur fellow SS are unlikely to be pleased by this decision, but Steiner's men are an unknown quantity. Until the Führer personally vouches for them, their role will be secondary."
 HGR_empower_the_ss_desc:0 "The SS are the Spartans of Germany - it would be the height of folly to misjudge Steiner's SS based on the failings of the Burgundians. The Wehrmacht are useful, but they lack the will and fighting spirit that marks out born soldiers.\n\nThe SS will hold primacy in Steiner's forces. They will be the ones at the vanguard, with the best equipment. So decrees the Führer."
 HGR_unified_unit_desc:0 "Our efforts are beginning to bear fruit; the SS and Wehrmacht are working together well for once. Credit is due to Steiner, though he was not happy about the extra work that the Führer had him put in.\n\nWhen battle is joined against the Burgundians, Himmler will come to fear the might of a joint Aryan military, working together for the common good of race and nation against his insane machinations."
 HGR_soldiers_are_soldiers_desc:0 "It is true that the SS is generally of higher quality than the Wehrmacht, but what really sets them apart is politicization. The Wehrmacht is by and large composed of 'citizen soldiers' who treat their job as no different from any other. While this means a lower level of morale and training, it is far easier to find qualified men for their ranks.\n\nAccordingly, Steiner is to boost the number of soldiers in his Wehrmacht units immediately, with the SS taking the cream of the crop instead."
 HGR_fill_out_the_ranks_desc:0 "Steiner's SS are diminished due to recent fighting with other units. It will be difficult to find new recruits amidst the post-Bürgerkrieg chaos, but we must try. The purest blood always makes itself known in harsh times.\n\nLet the trials begin. Strain the blood, find the great, and make them warriors. Then, find the good, and arm them too."
 HGR_fegelein_fegelein_fegelein_desc:0 "The loathsome parasite named Hermann Fegelein is a disgrace to his race, his nation and the SS. His advancement is owed solely to his politically-motivated marriage to Eva Braun's sister. He has no talents, no grand accolades, nothing to recommend him as an Aryan. He is a waste of skin.\n\nBut even scum have their uses. Fegelein is popular with civilians for some incomprehensible reason, and possesses substantial wealth that might be used for our benefit. Let's see if we can wring some use out of the little shit."
 HGR_an_appeal_to_degeneracy_desc:0 "Fegelein's popularity is supposedly due to his 'fine taste' and 'refinement'. Since when does an officer of the SS care for such things? Those manifestations of degenerate culture are exactly what the great Hitler wished to excise from the German racial consciousness!\n\nBut, if it will help... perhaps there is something we can offer him. Some small concessions, without any strings attached - none at all..."
 HGR_matter_of_the_truth_desc:0 "Fegelein is a rat, and a cunning one at that. His image as a dashing cavalryman may be invented - he's killed nobody able to fight back, after all - but that doesn't matter. Truth is subjective in this era of mass media - something he has proven with the torrent of slanderous propaganda being spewed at the Führer from his offices. That will need to be dealt with if he is to serve us.\n\nMistakenly, Fegelein believes that the Führer's popularity is so diminished that intelligent Germans might actually believe his Himmlerite lies. Let us show him what real manipulation via media looks like."
 HGR_dealing_with_degeneracy_desc:0 "Once Fegelein is ours, we must have a plan for dealing with him and his assets appropriately. There will need to be some redistribution of funds, acquired with his personal assistance, and an investigation into his many contacts to see what can be done with them.\n\nFegelein will surely prove himself a loyal servant. Once he does, we shall see to dispensing his just reward."
 HGR_propaganda_machine_desc:0 "With Fegelein's propaganda outlets in our hands, we can finally clarify some important points to the good people of Germany. Chief among them is that Fegelein was another Judeo-Bolshevik deceiver sent by the elders of Zion and their puppet, Heinrich Himmler, to undermine the unity of the Reich.\n\nAfter the Führer's image has been cleansed of the stain left upon it by Fegelein's deceptions, we shall turn its ire upon the shadow state. Let all know the depths of Burgundy's wretchedness and depravity."
 HGR_careful_balance_of_trust_desc:0 "As the Führer's coalition grows, it will become more difficult to hold together. Lesser men are not gifted with the clarity of purpose that a life in service to the Reich bestows. These people - these bickering people - all have their own interests, many conflicting, which may undermine the greater cause if not kept in check.\n\nThreats; bribes; coercion; nothing is off the table. We fight not only for the salvation of our race, but for this entire miserable world, degenerates and all. Failure is not an option; anything we must do is permissible."
 HGR_keep_the_military_sated_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht's short-term demands generally trend towards the practical. Their distrust can be alleviated to a considerable degree by showing that we will not empower the SS at their expense; to this end, we should make sure that their material needs are met and avoid the appearance of SS favoritism.\n\nMaintaining the militarists' loyalty in this way will require a substantial industrial investment to meet their demands. However, it will more than pay off if they are able to bring those guns to bear on Burgundy."
 HGR_glory_days_desc:0 "Aside from their hatred of the SS, what keeps the militarists on our side is the promise that we can fulfil the vision preached by Göring: the restoration of the Reich's previous glory and grandeur. Needless to say, that will not be possible at this time, but they don't need to know that.\n\nThe Wehrmacht has always been easily led. Mere promises of glory are generally enough to sate their discontent, but if those prove insufficient, there are alternate solutions - usually involving pomp, ceremony and massive recruitment drives."
 HGR_only_brass_tacks_left_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the militarists remain as short-sighted and recalcitrant as ever. Every slight, every insult and every grudge influences their conduct towards the SS. Given that the Führer himself is of the SS, this selfish factionalism is unacceptable.\n\nIf the situation turns against us, there will be no more glorious conquest or indulgent parades. Himmler will kill us all, then burn the world to ash. If any men of the Wehrmacht survive, it will be as withered, starving animals eking out a miserable existence among the torched ruins of our cities. This reality must be made exceedingly clear to our stubborn allies."
 HGR_nuclear_option_desc:0 "If all else fails - if the coalition is at risk, and petty rivalries and old grudges threaten to tear us apart - then we only have one option. Should it become necessary, the option remains to unreservedly distribute evidence of Himmler's ultimate plan, thereby sealing the cohesion of our forces.\n\nIt would be drastic, perhaps even unthinkable to some, but we must always remember what it is we are fighting for. No price - NO PRICE - is too high for this victory"
 HGR_keep_the_moderates_assuaged_desc:0 "If we bring Speerites and Bormannites into our coalition, they are unlikely to cause too much trouble. Nevertheless, they might influence each other in unduly problematic ways, like a flock of chickens panicking at the first sign of danger. The chains binding us must be strengthened to address this weak link.\n\nPredictably, the foremost concern of moderates is the civilian population. They fail to see the critical importance of military matters or the political struggle facing us. Still, if it must be done to calm their soft hearts, then we can make some small concessions."
 HGR_promise_not_to_kill_them_desc:0 "The moderates appear to believe that the Führer is planning to do away with them once Himmler is defeated. This belief is correct, but it does not serve us for them to continue holding it. We must ply their strings with a gentle hand so that they come to perceive only benevolence and an endorsement of 'normality' in the Führer's actions and words.\n\nObviously, it won't be true, but who will question our narrative when we can claim to have saved the entire world from destruction?"
 HGR_actually_promise_not_to_kill_them_desc:0 "It will not do to have any inconvenient - if legitimate - fears growing amongst the moderates. We need them to have full confidence in our regime. That cannot be accomplished solely through empty promises or by disappearing anyone who becomes a problem for us.\n\nOffering formal amnesties to prominent moderates will show our good intentions to the public. That way, they might be convinced that their opinion matters, and provide further support to the regime. Those who are too dedicated to the moderate cause can also be marked out for after our victory, when we shall finally deal with them appropriately."
 HGR_keep_the_untermensch_quiet_desc:0 "Non-Aryans should rightfully have no place in our coalition, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Where many Aryans have failed to heed our righteous call to arms, the lesser peoples of Europe have taken their place. Concerning, but any reservations we have are secondary to defeating Himmler.\n\nKeeping these degenerates satisfied is unlikely to be difficult. The needs of the subhuman are simple, befitting his brutish nature. We doubt they have any surprises for us."
 HGR_transfer_out_slaves_desc:0 "Our Führer once said: "Germany has grown soft and fat on the backs of its slaves. We must once again learn to stand, strong and proud, on our own two feet." This remains true even now; despite our desperate need for labor, the slaves continue to cause us trouble. The SS only has so many bullets, and ideally those should be reserved for the Burgundians.\n\nOur... lesser allies have expressed an interest in the repatriation of our slaves. We are loathe to surrender them to anyone rather than just dispose of them entirely, but it would be a most expedient solution to our problem."
 HGR_keep_our_ss_strong_desc:0 "The core of Heydrich's support base will always be the Deutsche-SS, not the Burgundians. While the latter must be constantly appeased, the former have always looked up to our new Führer as the paragon of National Socialism.\n\nRetaining the faithful sons of Germany in our coalition will not be complicated. They are typically content to receive the same rewards as they always have - albeit in ever-greater quantities. Unfortunately, the Spartanist attitude has not been correctly inculcated in the Deutsche-SS yet..."
 HGR_rewards_for_loyalists_desc:0 "Men of the Burgundian SS live a thankless existence. Utterly brainwashed into servility by Himmler, they care nothing for riches. While an austere life is the Aryan way, the circumstances of our time have depreciated that lifestyle in Germany proper.\n\nThe failings of the Deutsche-SS will be remedied in time, but for now they must see that service is worthwhile. Whether they demand arms, supplies, loot or cold, hard Reichsmarks, the price must be paid for the sake of our strength."
 HGR_expanding_the_inner_circle_desc:0 "The 'Inner Circle' generally refers to those aware of Himmler's plan for atomic annihilation. While it would not be inaccurate to state that violence is inherent to the National Socialist order - with good reason, of course - the Reichsführer's vision is too far for most.\n\nIf we fear complacency, it may do us some good to allow more of our allies to become aware of the nuclear plan. Most simply believe we are fighting a war against a usurper. If the true nature of this conflict is revealed, it might permanently galvanize them against Himmler."
 HGR_keep_the_himmlerites_loyal_desc:0 "Keeping Himmler's favorites on our side will require endless dedication. Their loyalty to Heydrich is predicated on viewing his vision as more valid than that of the Reichsführer's. If they have reason enough to doubt us, or are adequately tempted by Himmler's promise of a place in the bunkers, they will surely abandon us without hesitation.\n\nThankfully, Himmlerites lack the cold, reptilian mind of their namesake. They are creatures of emotion, defined by the ebb and flow of racial pride and hatred for the enemy. That makes them pliable, if nothing else."
 HGR_expose_himmlers_treachery_desc:0 "Himmlerites are accustomed to following orders, not acting autonomously. When the source of their guidance is cast into doubt, confusion and uncertainty reigns in their world. By this means, we can permanently sever their ties to Burgundy.\n\nWe possess much knowledge that Himmler would prefer to keep secret, along with a steady stream of new information from defectors. With that, and a few well-placed lies, we can string along the Himmlerites like fish chasing bait."
 HGR_allies_abroad_desc:0 "The insane treachery of Himmler runs deep in the SS, and has proliferated throughout the Fatherland. Against all reason, it seems we cannot even trust our own countrymen. Perhaps, if nationhood means nothing in these times, there might still be some value in shared Aryan heritage, however tenuous those ties of blood might be.\n\nWe shall look to distant shores and the blasted lands of the east. Whatever strength and virtue is to be found there must and shall be ours."
 HGR_dog_in_the_west_desc:0 "Henk Feldmeijer is a model collaborator. An early disciple of the volkisch brand of Dutch National Socialism, he always recognized the greater destiny of the united Germanic race, as opposed to the feeble and half-hearted separatism of Mussert and van Geelkerken. Though his record is not nearly as impressive as that of Degrelle and Eriksson, his loyalty is proven.\n\nNow our loyal hound finds himself pinned between the Reich, Burgundy and the sea. His panicked state makes him pliable, but also prone to rash decisions and vulnerable to invasion. The Dutchman's allegiance must be secured, or his lands seized and incorporated into the Reich, before Himmler turns his gaze north."
 HGR_place_in_the_reich_desc:0 "Despite his weaknesses, Feldmeijer is still a man of the SS with substantial forces at his command. Given the disunited state of the Reich, we might struggle to force his capitulation before Himmler does. Given those facts, and his record of loyalty, the Führer has decided to offer an open hand before trying the closed fist.\n\nFeldmeijer should be easy to sway. Himmler's disregard for collaborators is obvious to all at this point, so it should be a simple matter of providing him with guarantees of safety. His beliefs will do the rest."
 HGR_trip_to_der_hague_desc:0 "The Netherlands are not the naval power they used to be. Germany has nothing to fear from their motley assemblance of fishing boats and patrol vessels. Nor, for that matter, is Feldmeijer worth the time it will take to sway him. Indecisiveness and Germanic sectarianism will only cause us trouble. For that reason, a military solution has been decided upon.\n\nGrand Admiral Dönitz has suggested a swift naval landing as the best option to secure the Netherlands. Himmler's agents will be watching the border for our approach, but he will not expect anything from old Dönitz and the politically disfavored Kriegsmarine."
 HGR_by_our_side_desc:0 "As expected, Feldmeijer understands his position well. He poses no threat to us and is quite receptive to the Führer's overtures. There is no indication that he plans to side with Himmler.\n\nOnce it is certain that order has been restored in the Netherlands, our forces will move in to reinforce the borders and keep Himmler's forces at bay, under cover of the formal integration of the Netherlands into the Reich proper."
 HGR_under_new_management_desc:0 "Old Dönitz remains keen as ever; the Netherlands have been placed under occupation by seaborne invasion without too much trouble. Feldmeijer is in custody, and his men have surrendered to the Führer's authority.\n\nNow we need only determine what is the best course of action for managing the reclaimed Reichskommissariat. Direct integration into the Reich would be most welcome, but given the disposition of the Dutch it might be prudent to instead re-establish the RK administration temporarily."
 HGR_snake_in_the_east_desc:0 "Michal Vituska - a traitor both to his rightful masters and his own pernicious race. Of all who collaborated to bring about the demise of Judeo-Bolshevism, he was among the most eager. However, we should not mistake his past groveling for servility; his seizure of Ostland has demonstrated that he holds no regard for the correct order of things.\n\nThough we can never trust him, even the smallest of vipers can bear deadly venom. Better to have our hands around his serpentine neck than Himmler's - or, worse, no hands at all."
 HGR_lighter_touch_desc:0 "Vituska differs from most eastern brutes in that he possesses a vicious cunning, presumably to compensate for his lack of a backbone. He cares nothing for pride, only survival and advancement. Despicable traits, unworthy of the Reich's good graces - but they make him malleable.\n\nVituska knows that ultimately, he cannot stave off German control forever. The Führer will extend the hand of grace to his pretender kingdom and offer him promises of... loosened reins, perhaps. A favorable balance of power. He knows what's good for him, doesn't he?"
 HGR_stronger_arm_desc:0 "Vituska is a scheming reptile unworthy of respect or equal treatment. His 'loyalty' to the Reich was always imagined on our part, a mere farce contrived by himself and the Ostland government to appease Hitler in his old age. Heydrich sees through the subhuman's parlor tricks and sleight of hand, and will not approach him as anything but his rightful master.\n\nStrong words, backed by steel, will curb his ambition. Doubly so once we tighten the noose around Ostland and leave him starved of supplies from the Reich. The snake will serve, or he and his people will starve."
 HGR_the_man_in_ostland_desc:0 "Predictably, Vituska dances around the idea of an alliance, turning aside direct overtures with false flattery while making a mockery of our diplomats. Still, he knows what's good for him, and that his 'free peoples' cannot match our strength.\n\nThough 'cooperative' is too strong a word to describe his attitude, he does have a vested interest in preventing Himmler's victory. He is unlikely to offer any direct military support, but may offer 'assistance' if it will help to secure his personal rule of Ostland. At the very least, he won't be helping Himmler."
 HGR_tighten_our_grip_desc:0 "The pretender of Ostland holds firm against our 'diplomatic' pressure. Direct intervention might solve this little problem, but would also be an unwelcome distraction for our forces.\n\nA more surgical solution is required - preferably a nice, sharp one to open up the bastard's jugular. The 'Central European Council' is little more than an illusion created to fool the natives of Ostland into following Vituska; once he is disposed of, his movement will disintegrate like snow in the sun."
 HGR_bring_the_garrison_home_desc:0 "The Cornwall Garrison is a rightly vaunted element of the Wehrmacht. They have been watchful eyes and stalwart guardians alike, doing their duty to keep the British Isles secure. Their commander, Franz Halder, is not an SS man but would certainly trust Heydrich over Himmler any day.\n\nWe must ascertain the garrison's situation and bring them home if possible. Their high standard of training and discipline will match even the best of Himmler's minions."
 HGR_talk_with_halder_desc:0 "As expected, Halder has retained his position over the upstart English. Proof, if more was ever needed, of the value in securing his allegiance. Preliminary assessments inform us that he is almost certainly open to negotiation with the Führer.\n\nHalder's price will likely be assured amnesty and assistance for his men. The Cornwall Garrison has become a tight-knit group, indeed. However, he remains at a considerable distance from the Reich proper. We shall need the assistance of the Kriegsmarine or Luftwaffe to bring the Wehrmacht's finest home."
 HGR_picking_up_the_remnants_desc:0 "In a disappointing turn of events, Halder and his forces have been overthrown by the English. Not unexpected, considering their isolation - but a poor showing indeed. Still, soldiers are soldiers, and the situation cannot be blamed solely on Halder's... inconsistency.\n\nThe English are a moralistic people despite their perfidy. Most of the garrison is likely still alive, confined to POW camps. With England in a precarious state, they would not object to losing a few thousand hungry mouths."
 HGR_reverse_sealion_desc:0 "In a better world, perfidious Albion would forever remain under the German yoke. Sadly, this is not such a world. This is a world where all we know has been turned upside-down and brought into question by Himmler's treachery.\n\nThe sea lion has sunned itself on Cornish shores for long enough. Now the Fatherland calls, and the last vestige of German power in the Isles must return home. The English will no doubt be pleased to see the Kriegsmarine's transports departing for the horizon after twenty years. Let them have their fleeting joy - without Halder's men, it might be the last they ever experience."
 HGR_the_evac_desc:0 "The English have some decency left, it seems - they have agreed to return our men captured during the Anglo stab-in-the-back. The rebellious swine deserve nothing resembling gratitude or respect, but the situation demands it. We shall... graciously... accept the return of our honorable soldiers.\n\nHalder's men suffered considerable losses in battle with the English, but enough of them remain to add some real meat to our forces. Hopefully, the day will come when they shall return to England's green and pleasant land - next time, to stay."
 HGR_money_talks_desc:0 "The Bretons, in all their bastardry and greed, remain as useful as ever. In times of treachery such as these, perhaps unscrupulous men are just what we need - especially if they come bearing arms aplenty.\n\nKnowing Brittany, they will also be selling to Himmler and anyone else in the Reich willing to pay. They will pay for their double-dealing later, but for now we must play the game and indulge their avarice."
 HGR_true_sons_of_brittany_desc:0 "The order in Brittany has changed - whether for better or worse, it is hard to say. On the one hand, the Breton SS could be a useful ally. On the other, many of them are known Himmlerites who live under the delusion that an alliance with the Reichsführer would be in their country's best interest.\n\nIf we are to utilize the Bretons to our advantage, steps must be taken to keep the Himmlerites from power and maintain loyal National Socialists as the reigning authority. The possibility of Himmler gaining exclusive control of the black market is too terrible to permit."
 HGR_the_market_is_open_desc:0 "Perhaps it is for the best that the Breton SS has not seized the apparatus of state. To lose access to the black market would be highly detrimental to our cause. The flow of arms will continue for the time being so long as Himmler does not bring his forces to bear on the mercantile state.\n\nIn fact, the threat of such might be exactly what we need to force the Bretons to pick a side. Neutrality only works so long as it is respected by everyone else... and neither the Führer nor Himmler do so."
 HGR_convince_them_of_himmlers_treachery_desc:0 "A useful circumstance has arisen as a result of swaying certain Himmlerites to the Führer's side. Burgundian invasion plans are now in our possession, specifically ones pertaining to a certain peninsular state on the western border.\n\nThe regime in Brittany would doubtless be most intrigued by these verifiably genuine documents... not to mention utterly infuriated, considering the Himmlerite leanings of their SS. It would be very unfortunate for Himmler if someone were to pass the invasion plans along and thereby drive the Bretons into the Führer's camp..."
 HGR_der_untermensch_desc:0 "There is no race in Europe so perfidious, barbaric and belligerent as the Polish. Time and again, they have risen against the Germanic empires, bringing wrack and ruin to rightfully German lands. They have been a thorn in the side of every great power to ever rule their benighted country, and will never learn their place no matter how many times we bring down the boot on their scrawny necks.\n\nStubborn as mules, cunning as foxes and brutish as apes - qualities that might, in some repulsive twist of fate, actually be useful to us."
 HGR_reassert_our_influence_desc:0 "The Poles have their backs to the wall. Their nation is doomed and they know it. The moment any significant force is brought to bear on their resurgent state, they will crumple like sheet metal under a panzer's treads.\n\nIf there are any wise men among the seething millions of Polish in the former Generalgouvernment, they will advocate for immediate surrender and subservience to the Führer. The Poles will bend, or they will break. No alternative is possible."
 HGR_unfortunate_realities_desc:0 "It is wrong - wrong beyond all measure. The Poles represent everything loathsome in the subhuman soul... but so many of our own race have turned out worse. The world seems inverted, all deformed and demented. General Speidel - Speidel, the savior of the Reich - now advocates for an alliance of pragmatism with one of our greatest enemies.\n\nIf this shame will prevent one incalculably greater, then so be it."
 HGR_lost_again_desc:0 "More than twenty years have passed since we last crushed the Poles underfoot, but little has changed. The Pole is, as ever, a stubborn but feeble enemy. Without the moralizing of certain Heer generals, there was no need to show such restraint this time around. The Home Army is scattered or dead, allowing us to bring our full manpower to bear against more worthy foes.\n\nThe the Generalgouvernment can now be restored under the auspices of Heydrich's chosen man, rather than some buffoon from the NSDAP. Never again will the mules of the east rise against the master race."
 HGR_deal_with_the_devil_desc:0 "As this obscene venture was General Speidel's idea, the hope was that he would act as a middleman between the Führer and the rebellious Poles. No luck there, it seems - the bastards will only negotiate directly with Heydrich himself.\n\nWe should punish such insolence with invasion, but we have few enough allies already. Perhaps... perhaps this, too, is the price that must be paid for salvation. One more compromise, one more betrayal of Germany and National Socialism. If Hitler could see us now..."
 HGR_the_forgotten_realm_desc:0 "Josias zu Waldeck-Pyrmont - a troubled man, to say the least. Once a devoted Himmlerite, he was recently spurned by the Reichsführer and abandoned that cause. Furthermore, in the chaos of the Bürgerkrieg, Reichskommissariat Kaukasien has become de-facto independent.\n\nIf he is no friend of Himmler, but still a German, then he is a friend of ours. Josias' long reign is well-deserved, and his resources will be critical to defeating the arch-traitor."
 HGR_promises_of_wealth_desc:0 "Kaukasia is chronically underfunded. Little wonder that partisans and bandits plague the countryside when Germania only ever cared for the oil it could squeeze from Josias' domain. Perhaps the Führer can help.\n\nThere is a veritable laundry list of the things Josias needs: weapons, vehicles, consumer goods, and cash. All that and more could be at his disposal if he aligns himself with our cause."
 HGR_promises_of_power_desc:0 "Reichskommissar of Kaukasia is a fine posting, but is that truly where Josias would like to end his career? There are many more rungs he has yet to reach on the ladder of power. Head of the Orpo, or maybe the SD? Perhaps even a place in the Führer's cabinet?\n\nSurely he would like to go further. Every office will need filling someday..."
 HGR_more_than_you_could_dream_of_desc:0 "Josias is from a most noble house. Often, the old nobility of Germany have been trouble for the Reich, but Josias has earned his status beyond all doubt. Still, his qualities and deeds have gone unrecognized by the NSDAP; the Führer now wishes to make amends for this historically unfair treatment.\n\nLike all nobles, Josias is a man of taste. Not for him is the simple allure of Reichsmarks. To ingratiate ourselves to him, we could offer his choice of more refined and elegant rewards. Göring had quite the treasure trove - perhaps the esteemed prince would like first pick?"
 HGR_his_own_little_kingdom_desc:0 "Kaukasia is the true success story in the history of National Socialist colonialism. Thanks to Josias' constant vigil and tireless administrative efforts, it has become the oil-field and ore mine of the entire Reich. Without Kaukasia - without Josias - some might even say the Reich would not be what it is today!\n\nIt is only fitting, therefore, that regardless of future career advancements, Josias should be permitted to retain command of Kaukasia. A little kingdom of sorts, all to his own - not that we would ever suspect him of royal ambitions!"

 HGR_successor.1.t:0 "Open Fire"
 HGR_successor.1.desc:0 "The day began quietly. At dawn, a group of students gathered around the Central SS Office in Bonn. Using typical student chants and yelling about democracy and vaguely protesting the newfound influence of the Schutzstaffel on the government, the crowd seemed to grow throughout the day. It had to be one of the greatest marches in weeks, at least since Heydrich had been declared successor. It was not surprising, ultimately.\n\nYes, the students protested all authoritarian rule, but the common German family would simply live if their way of live did not seem to be threatened. Heydrich threatened that. The prospect of truly living a Burgundian life, becoming a Spartan, dying en masse for the state. No. That was for Jews and Slavs, not an upstanding, reformist Aryan. So for the first time in what seemed like forever, middle class families began protesting. Timidly, and at first in small number, but they grew and grew. By midday, there must have been a thousand people. They went on, and on, chanting and chanting, and it finally died down a bit. A few departed.\n\nAs soon as they did, three shots rang out from the SS building. Snipers. Three men began screaming. One went silent. The other quieted to a whimper. Three more shots, two more brief screams. Somewhere, a rapid fire gun went off. There was a stampede. A secondary school student was trampled trying to run. Dozens wailed. This was not the plan. This was not the plan. They had never opened fire on a crowd, not like this.\n\nThe square was silent, besides the remaining few whimpers. Everybody had either fled or been shot."
 HGR_successor.1.a:0 "We live in a brave new world."
 
 HGR_successor.2.t:0 "Smile Beside Hitler"
 HGR_successor.2.desc:0 "Hitler, Führer of the Reich, stood up to the podium and had a coughing fit. When he was done, he looked up at the crowd, peered at them for a second, and then looked down at a script placed on the podium beforehand.\n\n"I reaffirm the capability of my appointed successor..."\n\nHitler looked dazed, and asked the bodyguard next to him what that name was.\n\n"Heydrich, mein Führer."\n\nHe said it as if he had to say that frequently, without the usual fear when addressing the Führer.\n\n"-the capability of my appointed successor, Heydrich, as a Führer in what will be my last and most unfortunate absence. The man has served me loyally and will continue to serve the Reich. The man is not only a vanguard of the Aryan race, but a true enemy of Jews the world over. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Where - I... Thank you."\n\nHitler stumbled off the stage, to the confusion of the crowd."
 HGR_successor.2.a:0 "Well, at least we got that second endorsement."
 
 HGR_successor.3.t:0 "Dark Eyes"
 HGR_successor.3.desc:0 "Fear lives in Germany. Invited, welcomed, it cradles the heart of every person and locks their minds in silver, austere cages.\n\nFear lives in the children, who stop their games of street football as soldiers, clad in black and adorned with mortality, march in sharp columns. They whisper to each other, dreading what they do not know yet still, with horrifying accuracy, understand.\n\nFear lives in the soldiers, who eye each other with suspicion and murder. They see the battles and bombs turned inwards on themselves. They see their own mangled bodies trampled underfoot by the children who will fight the war they could not.\n\nFear lives in Heydrich. Nestled close to his heart, it beats in tandem composing a vile rhythm. All Heydrich knows is fear. He fears the children. He fears the soldiers. He fears his own fear. His preparations cannot alleviate his terror. They embolden it."
 HGR_successor.3.a:0 "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear."
 
 HGR_successor.4.t:0 "Rubicon"
 HGR_successor.4.desc:0 "The orders were curt, simple, and precise. They came in a flurry through official and unofficial channels, flooding the Reichstag with an contradictory sense of liberation and fear. Bureaucrats and politicians milled around like a dying haze. There was little else to do.\n\nThe new Führer had not bothered to give a pompous speech or issue a formal announcement. A new Germany was in the making and he couldn't afford to be distracted by the egos of irrelevant relics from a decadent era. They served no benefit towards the creation of a true Aryan state and so they did not matter.\n\nThis new truth took slightly longer to reach the collective indignation of the Reichstag. The bloated corpse of a dead republic clung so desperately to its existence, as though it hadn't already ceased to exist three decades ago. Inexorably, however, reality fell to the floor for all to see."

 HGR_successor.5.desc:0 "The men moved quickly, but not hastily. They were prepared, experienced. Every action was taken with cold, surgical precision. Thousands of them, constructed like clockwork, made their simultaneous moves.\n\nThe SS had a knack for destruction. They sliced up wires, immolated documents, and brutalized trusted messengers. Every effort was made to blind the prying eyes, amputate the groping hands, and deafen the eavesdropping ears of Heydrich's opposition. By the end of the day, orders and communiques descended into confusion and convulsion.\n\nHeydrich's own methods of communication stood intact, of course. Information passed smoothly between his commanders and men. They were united in purpose and thought. The traitorous rabble, distinguishable only by their specific brand of degeneracy, could not help but feel awe at their own isolation."
 HGR_successor.5.a:0 "An entire nation deaf."
 
 HGR_successor.6.t:0 "Burgundian Reinforcements"
 HGR_successor.6.desc:0 "Free trade was often seen as a sign of opening up to the world around a nation, expanding economic and cultural horizons.\n\nThis was anything but. Every night, a caravan of trucks approached the German border from Burgundy. The drivers could hardly be seen through the tinted windows, but a keen-sighted observer would universally see men wearing dark sunglasses wearing heavy coats. They transported unknown cargo. Nuclear weaponry? Poison for the masses? Toiletries? No one knew, especially because the usually quite thorough border guards waved anybody in the particular Burgundian truck without a second thought. And the trucks just kept on coming. For the first time in forever, Burgundy was opening up. They were sending their terrible cargo into Germany.\n\nWorse still, when the trucks finally entered the Reich proper, they always ended up at Schutzstaffel offices and the cities with the most support for the newly appointed successor. Soon enough, there were reports of extravagant SS celebrations, with specially made Burgundian champagne and some of whatever cargo was in those trucks. Cities supporting Heydrich saw an ever-so-slight uptick in economic performance, just at the moment those trucks began to drive in. Someone west of the border was playing favorites."

 HGR_successor.7.t:0 "The Plot to Capture Speer"
 HGR_successor.7.desc:0 "With Adolf Hitler, the Führer, having chosen Reinhard Heydrich as his successor, it is clear that we must take out any and all enemies who seek to destabilize the German Reich. That includes Albert Speer, who has acquired a reputation as being a leading democratic figure within the ever changing and factional Reich.\n\nHeydrich has already begun the search for Speer, sending out loyal SS divisions to hunt down the man and ordering all available Gestapo units nationwide to keep an eye out in case Speer is spotted or if he manages to mysteriously emerge.\n\nIt is clear, however, that this hunt will not be easy and that Speer has taken many precautions to hide himself in the case of an event such as this. In addition, the already raucous students have taken to supporting Speer and are already resisting us at every turn. No matter, for we shall successfully deal with any and all traitors within the Reich, bringing about a golden age."
 HGR_successor.7.a:0 "For stability and unity within the Reich!"
 
 HGR_successor.8.t:0 "The Beginning of the End"
 HGR_successor.8.desc:0 "For Heydrich it was another day, him counting down the seconds until the clock struck half past nine.\n\nFor Germany, it was the beginning of a nightmare.\n\nThe Führer would have announced his decision around twenty minutes ago, if the old man had managed to get out of bed that day. The news would have covered it ten minutes after, if the censors rushed it through as they would for one of his more lucid speeches. Five minutes after that it'd be in New York and Tokyo, ten minutes after it'd be firing across Russia and through Africa.\n\nBut none of that mattered, instead Heydrich sat and stared at the clock ticking dutifully towards the moment, his eyes briefly flickering towards the telephone segregated neatly from the rest at the back left quadrant of his desk, next to six pens of three different colors and a black marker in a perfect row alongside it. The Burgundian telephone they called it. Himmler's line to Germany. To Heydrich, it was the mouth of the last true man in Germany, through which he spoke to Heydrich and to the world.\n\nThe clock ticked past its mark, and within the second the phone rang, two seconds later and Heydrich pressed it to his ear, where the greatest patron of Germany's future relayed his words."
 HGR_successor.8.a:0 "Congratulations, mein Schüler, it is time."
 
 HGR_successor.9.t:0 "Sacrifices to be Made..."
 HGR_successor.9.desc:0 "Oberscharführer Blösche was three minutes late as Heydrich's watch told him, something simply unacceptable for an officer of his SS. His men were to be early, fifteen minutes at the least, an hour at the usual, but to be late? The man was only lucky that Heydrich had summoned him for duties deemed important by Herr Himmler, he was unlucky enough that those duties would get him killed.\n\n"Sieg Heil!" the man snapped out with a salute that, to anyone else, would have been perfect. But the hand sag at the last moment was enough to show laziness - or exhaustion - it made no matter.\n\n"You have orders, Oberscharführer," Heydrich answered after several long moments, letting his icy stare seep into the man like cold water. "One given to us by our benefactor to the west."\n\n"Give me the order, Herr Heydrich..." the man paused at the continued silence before swallowing and continuing. "I... I apologize for my tardiness. I was kept by my duties. One of my men was-"\n\n"Enough," Heydrich answered, unmoving. He let exactly fifteen seconds pass before continuing. "I smell the stench of cigarettes, unbecoming of a National-Socialist male, and especially of a member of the SS. It does not matter, however, you will make up for it soon."\n\nHe raised one hand, and the guard by the door shot Oberscharführer Blösche in the back of the head."
 HGR_successor.9.a:0 "Your sacrifice for the greater good will be all the redemption you need."
 
 HGR_successor.10.t:0 "...And Moves to be Made in Silence"
 HGR_successor.10.desc:0 "Oberscharführer Blösche had been a suitable sacrifice. A dedicated and loyal man of the SS, but one with too many faults to ignore. His time in Poland had softened him, for while he did everything he had been asked to do, he had come to loathe it. The man had started smoking soon after, and drinking, though both in moderation. 'To calm the nerves', he and many other soldiers would say. Heydrich knew this just meant a heart of cowardice, and sympathy for the untermensch.\n\nStill, he had been loyal, and his men had seen him as a model leader, always on their side, always looking out for them above all. Another sign of weakness, but at least one that almost embodied the Aryan ideal. That made it almost a shame that, approximately sixteen minutes ago if the staff car had met an empty road that night, his body was to be dumped near Koblenz, shot through the head by a Wehrmacht issued pistol, in an alley on a street known to be frequented by military men on their nights off.\n\nHeydrich didn't smile, but he took grim satisfaction in the plan, the fruition of his master's orders, at least implicitly. Tomorrow, there would be blood on the streets, and on the Wehrmacht's hands."
 HGR_successor.10.a:0 "When possessed with the worm, it is almost pathetically trivial to bait a fish."
 
 HGR_successor.11.t:0 "The Hook Sinks"
 HGR_successor.11.desc:0 "Six hours, fourteen minutes and forty three seconds ago a body had been found in an alley, his men told him. Twenty seven minutes after it was successfully identified by the Orpo, with assistance from the SD, that the man had been a member of the SS. Forty after and word had leaked that he had been murdered by a young Wehrmacht man named Hans Friestig, who found himself promptly beaten within an inch of his life and then, four hours and ten minutes ago, was shot by SS Sturmmann Ludwig Menz, a boy who saw the deceased SS member as a father figure.\n\nThree hours ago, on the dot when the second passed ten, the Wehrmacht responded by assaulting an SS barracks for the boy.\n\nOne hour and eleven minutes ago, Koblenz burned. And as the clock passed midday, Heydrich knew that so too would Germany."
 HGR_successor.11.a:0 "And when they are possessed of the mind and spirit of an animal, it is only too easy to make them act as prey."
 
 HGR_successor.12.t:0 "Like Ants, They Swarm"
 HGR_successor.12.desc:0 "Three thousand rifles, forty seven tanks, nine helicopters, and two thousand men. So far as dawn ticked forward, that is what had been reported missing from barracks and motorpools across the Reich.\n\nAcross highways and backroads, armored cars proudly emblazoned with the twin lightning bolts of the SS rolled towards destinations unknown. Others were unmarked, moving silently through open towns and past the roadblocks of the army.\n\nIn Koblenz, and Nuremberg, and Munich and Jena and Chemnitz and Waren, the world burned. SS men exacted bloody revenge, Wehrmacht men did in kind, and the people were just caught in the middle.\n\nThe black dots of SS vehicles moved towards battle, and many more moved elsewhere. With the chaos of a scorched earth, none could notice the swarm. They moved into their nests, and crawled into their hives, and there they waited. Soon, a king would fall.\n\nSoon, as days were crossed off and hours and minutes dutifully lurched forward, the world would change."
 HGR_successor.12.a:0 "They crawl into the dark, from which a new dawn will rise."
 
 HGR_successor.13.t:0 "An Epoch"
 HGR_successor.13.desc:0 "Heydrich sat in his office and stared ahead, letting the familiar ticking guide his thoughts. The office was bare, as was befitting to a man of the SS, and only his own mind could rightfully take his attention. The click clacking of boots down the hall let him know that, within ten or fifteen steps and four seconds, Reichsleiter Bouhler would arrive to tell him the news. Operation Ludwig would be, for there was no alternative, a success.\n\nHis mind raced for a moment, a pathetic, insidious loss of control that he quickly quelled. He remembered the old man, he remembered the coup, he remembered his only crisis of faith. The laugh he had given when Heydrich informed him he was to be under 'SS protection'. The moment he realized that such an order was impossible. The moment he understood the level of his failure to Herr Himmler, and the moment he would redeem himself for.\n\nA knock at the door, a greeting and a salute. No Heil Hitler, not anymore. Bouhler gave him a nod as he finished the report, that the Führer was to be rushed to the hospital, that the causes could only be natural.\n\nHeydrich stood, carefully folding his arms behind his back. It was time to leave."
 HGR_successor.13.a:0 "Herr Bouhler, there is work to be done."
 
 HGR_successor.14.t:0 "Dawn of the Black Sun"
 HGR_successor.14.desc:0 "In the dormant Reichstag building, twelve former representatives found themselves drinking cyanide, rubbing hands on arsenic, or finding themselves strangled by thin wires in dark corners.\n\nIn the nearby Bendlerblock, a truck smashed through the gates and into the front lobby. The bomb blast, approximately 1.2 Mt in size, tore half of the building's center to the ground and killed four different senior Wehrmacht officers along with their staff.\n\nAnd across Germany, the SS stepped out of the dark. They took over post offices and roadblocks and barracks, they scattered the Wehrmacht to the countryside and began their grim work. As the so called pretenders to his throne reeled from confusion, they sliced away like a trained butcher. Before them, the fat of Germany was minced away.\n\nHeydrich's car hit the third bump in the long road to his new headquarters, and he then knew even without looking out the window that he had arrived. The war was beginning, but to Heydrich, it was just yet another plan to be inevitably finished to only the exacting standard of the Aryan ideal."
 HGR_successor.14.a:0 "Let them know fear, as we bring forth a new day."
 
 ### GCW Events

 HGR.1.t:0 "Heydrich's Germany"
 HGR.1.desc:0 "The Wehrmacht was confused at the start of the civil war. With dozens of different orders coming from different commands ordering them to open fire on other army units, the military largely fell into anarchy, matching their home nation. The SS, however, largely avoided this chaos. Already having orders to prepare for battle, and having armed themselves in preparation for this battle for the fate of Germania, the SS was prepared for the struggle, and almost unanimously fell under command of Reinhard Heydrich. Many Wehrmacht garrisons suspected to harbor sympathies against Heydrich were gunned down before they realized that 'Bestellung 88' had arrived, an order authorizing the SS to annihilate any possible rebels before they even come to arms.\n\nSS units have largely centralized around their bases in Danzig or in Elsaß-Lothringen, close to Burgundy, where arms and supplies have already begun flowing in to assist them with their struggle. And although Burgundy has officially claimed neutrality in the struggle so far, all know that Heydrich has Himmler's backing."
 HGR.1.a:0 "The strongest shall survive!"
 
 HGR.2.t:0 "Burgundian Aid"
 HGR.2.desc:0 "Supplies found themselves from Burgundy into the hands of the SS even before the civil war broke out, and after they only intensified in number. With Heydrich being known as little more than Himmler's puppet, it was little surprise that he received massive amounts of aid from Himmler's personal nation in Burgundy. Volunteers were plentiful as well, and multiple SS units from Burgundy also found themselves in Germany, fighting on behalf of Heydrich. The other pretenders have all protested the move, claiming Burgundy is, in practice, invading Germany, but their whining won't matter much when they're dead."
 HGR.2.a:0 "The strongest shall survive!"
 
 HGR.3.t:0 "Karl Dönitz Launches Coup in Crimea!"
 HGR.3.desc:0 "With the Reich tumbling headlong into chaos, the silence from Crimea has grown increasingly deafening. The home of Germany's Black Sea fleet and with enough naval infrastructure to construct a small steel island, the bustling port has seen a huge amount of attention, with rumors of daily arrivals of 'gifts' flooding the Governors stately home on Greuthungistraße. However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways.\n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."
 HGR.3.a:0 "That blasted traitor!"
 
 HGR.5.t:0 "Himmler's Dissatisfaction"
 HGR.5.desc:0 "According to Himmler, due to our lack of accomplishment in terms of defeating the enemy factions within the civil war, he has seen it fit to take matters into his own hands. With our failure at further expansion beyond the borders of what loyal areas had flocked to us, alongside low morale and high anarchy within our nation, Himmler has effectively, and permanently, relieved Heydrich of his duties by having him killed through the use of an assassination. What was once Heydrich's Germany shall now join Ordensstaat Burgund, it seems..."
 HGR.5.a:0 "You have failed me for the last time, Heydrich."
 
 HGR.6.t:0 "Speidel's Germania"
 HGR.6.desc:0 "The guardians of the Reich, the SS, have retaken Germany from the degenerate pretenders that claimed to love the people of the Reich. They have been sent running or left dead in the wake of this bloody strife, and our Gestapo will find the ones who remain. Victory has been achieved in the name of the Fatherland, with gracious help from Burgundy and Himmler, yet there is one final obstacle to our quest of retaking Germany, and reshaping the Aryan spirit with it. That would be Speidel, and his former commander Rommel. At the beginning of our march to return Germany to the correct ideals, he launched a coup to 'protect Germania from the worst'. Now that we have completed our victory, however, his little game will come to an end. Speidel has been ordered to surrender his weapons and re-integrate into Germany properly. Even though it is clear that his decadent ideals have corrupted himself enough to refuse this, perhaps some more... rational thought from his generals may clear things up very quickly. But if he does not stand down to the rightful Führer, then we will take action, and punish the degenerate Germanians with their decadent ideals. Quickly."

Although the Welthauptstadt has been corrupted by greed, degeneracy, and chaos, the rightful Führer, Heydrich, will quickly ensure that these practices come to an end.\n\nThe end of the long and brutal German Civil War would normally be a joyous time for Germany, but the streets of Germania are empty. Citizens have locked themselves in their homes in fear, with some of the more daft Germanians even attempting Communist-like partisan attacks. These attackers, however, were made short work of, and the partisans we captured have been executed publicly to set an example. The new rules the German public must follow to ensure the Aryan ideals thrive shall be met, finally, and the rightful Führer now stands with a united Reich we have been fighting for."

 HGR.8.t:0 "Speidel Refuses Surrender!"
 HGR.8.desc:0 "From the beginning, we have been prepared to fight for our Welthauptstadt. After all, degenerates will fight the hardest to retain their ideology of sin. To this end, we have been proven correct: Speidel has predictably declared that Germania will never fall to the forces of Himmler and his puppet, and has called all Germanians to fight against us. Even if our people have raised us concerns on the future state of Germania, whether it will survive the fighting, we are confident enough in our SS to purge the pure capital belonging to the Aryan citizen of any degenerates while ensuring unity and peace remains. The important news, most of all, is that Speidel does not wish to end his little charade.\n\nThe Führer will fix that."

Millions are dead, and the major cities of Germany have been absolutely wiped out, none free from some form of devastation or another. As more and more of the little remaining infrastructure becomes victim to various war efforts, food and supplies no longer move around, and the famine only gets worse, disease quickly following along with it.\n\nThis is the true beginning of what people are calling the German Anarchy, and the worst has yet to come."

Field Marshal Speidel has reportedly been arrested and is now awaiting trial, which must now wait until after the war is concluded.\n\nShockwaves off the capture of Germania have already affected the morale of our opposition, with the fact that even the combined forces of Bormann, Göring, and Speer not being enough to halt the dark prince's advance causing great unease internationally. Whilst an eerie silence has taken over the city as the population wait to see what lays in store for them now, we know that it will not be long until all of Germany is subdued under the black boot of the SS."

How much ammo they had, how much ammo they needed, how much ammo they expected to be lost if the enemy dedicated themselves to sabotage, how much ammo was to be lost in the more likely scenario that the enemy dedicated themselves to bombarding them, how much food they had, how long the food would last in siege, how long rations would last if civilians were put on a single meal a day, how much food would be saved if militia forces were also put on a single meal, how much food would be saved if they all just ate a single meal a day, which parts of the city were the most well barricaded, which parts were the least, where the enemy would most likely attack, where they wouldn't attack (which means they very might do so in an attempt to surprise them), most likely composition of enemy forces, amount of armored support they had, how much aircraft they could field, the number of vehicles that had been left abandoned outside of the city they had likely reclaimed.\n\nHe read a thousand records and dockets and the damn dossiers and he did it while giving orders and ensuring the situation did not fall into chaos, and he did it without skipping a beat until a junior aide ran in to inform him that the Butcher had demanded their surrender."

Germania was to fall soon. It needed to if he was to establish himself properly and to keep his master happy, but a day or so to keep the enemy on their toes wouldn't hurt. He had the advantage of time, Speidel did not. Nobody was coming to save him, and this time there was no Führer to save him from the might of the SS.\n\n"Mein Führer!" he heard from behind, and he lowered the binoculars to give the city one last good stare before turning. "We've received a response, directly from Feldmarschall Speidel!"\n\n"And it is?"

Smoke from where the armor had finally been punctured and from a fire raging across the east wing had left the general's damp skin as black as ash.\n\n"Lost your capsule? Couldn't quite bite through?" Heydrich asked, looking past the general to where several of his men stumbled from the smoke to be shot by a waiting firing squad.\n\n"I won't die a cowards death, Hangman. When the sons and daughters of Germany come for you, I doubt you'll say the same."\n\n"The sons and daughters of Germany..." Heydrich said wistfully, looking down at the line of corpses next to the building, the remains of defenders-both civilian and professional soldiers-and SS men both. One of Speidel's dead traitors could have been no older than thirteen.\n\nHeydrich shrugged before turning around and walking away. "Capture anyone still in there alive, and put them all away.""

 HGR.25.desc:0 ""Where is Martin Bormann?" Heydrich asked calmly. The degenerate seated before him groaned in response. He sighed, clenched his fists, and swung another silent punch. Three teeth clattered to the floor.\n\nHeydrich had successfully penetrated the malodorous boil on the face of the Reich and crushed the forces of Martin Bormann. The blood of cowards and traitors stained Heydrich's conquered land as the vanquished blasted bullets into their own skulls. The stagnant pustule had finally burst, releasing an explosion of bureaucrats and soldiers pathetically scrambling from the wrath of the SS.\n\nYet there was one man's blood that Heydrich craved above all else. The SS had stretched their wings and swooped down, glaring into every alleyway and under every floorboard. They had discovered the Generals Wilhelm Burgdorf and Walther Wenck lying side-by-side in an abandoned barracks, their shattered wine bottles and bleeding heads leaking crimson across the floor. Walther Hewel and the rest of Bormann's cabinet were found in an underground bunker, eyes staring towards the ceiling, their open maws caked with dried foam.\n\n"I don't know!" the naked man screamed. The pitch irritated Heydrich. Of the many scurrying rats captured in the aftermath of the collapse, Baldur von Schirach had proven the most useful. As Bormann's second-in-command, his proclamation of surrender over the radio had doubtless seeped the final vestiges of energy from the last Bormannite holdouts.\n\nVon Schirach was not lying. He had suffered far worse at the hands of the SS torturers before Heydrich had even entered the building. What would a few more punches achieve? Heydrich took out his pistol and shot the wriggling worm in the head. Had Bormann fled the country? Was he hiding in an underground bunker, or lying dead under heaps of debris? He would never stop hunting for that grotesque dwarf."

 HGR.26.desc:0 "The bitter westward wind blasted over the huddled mass of civilians, chilling them to the bone. SS troops prowled through the crowd with predatory eyes, searching for a hint of suspicious activity. Reinhard Heydrich wriggled his hand into a tight black glove and silently nodded towards the gallows. Piano wire nooses were placed onto the swinging meat hooks with care.\n\nMany reformist traitors had cracked under interrogation. They told the tale of Albert Speer, who fled Germany a week before the remnants of his degenerate acolytes officially declared surrender. The liberal weasel who had sought to betray the Aryan race, the man of avarice and ego who had aligned himself with secret Capitalists and crypto-Bolsheviks, had abandoned his own movement. The black tendrils of the SS had wrapped around the torch of liberty and snuffed it out for all eternity.\n\nHeydrich watched with cold satisfaction as four men were led onto the gallows. Like Speer, these rats had also attempted to scurry away to America, the largest hive of corruption and miscegenation on the planet. Unlike Speer, they had left too late. The four men stood trembling on the platform, their loose ties and open jackets fluttering violently. Despite their bruised and bloodied faces, Heydrich could just about recognize them.\n\nKiesinger was glancing across the crowd with unfocused eyes. Erhard's blanched face and wobbling chins incited much amusement among the patrolling SS troops. Tresckow was staring at Heydrich in defiance, though his quivering legs betrayed him. Where Schmidt's eyes had once been were two swollen lumps of purple flesh. The rat was whispering under his breath.\n\nHeydrich raised his hand. In the reflection of his unblinking blue eyes, eight legs jerked violently. He counted the minutes. Eight for Tresckow. Eleven for Kiesinger. Fifteen for Schmidt. Nineteen for Erhard."

 HGR.27.desc:0 "Göring's corpse swayed gently in the breeze, the dried blood staining its clothing a dark crimson. Heydrich's eyes drifted upwards towards the blackening skies. He anticipated rainfall within approximately five minutes.\n\nHis father had once mused that life could come from death. On one hand, he concurred. For instance, the rotting carcass of 'Orthodox National Socialism' had provided a grotesque incubator for reformist and militarist maggots to wriggle out of. On the other hand... once something had been annihilated as brutally as Göring and Schörner's armies, the concept of resurrection remained a fantastical Christian fantasy.\n\nThe collapse of the militarists before the onslaught of the SS had been devastating. Many of the incompetent, screeching generals who had sought to alleviate the gradual death of National Socialism through mindless plunder and warfare had been quick to shoot themselves before capture. The less fortunate had been left at Heydrich's mercy.\n\nHermann Göring, a man who valued status and wealth above blood and soil, was captured alongside his family attempting to flee to Zentralafrika. He had expected fair treatment, a fancy new uniform, and a quick salute before facing a firing squad. A week in SS custody had proven the folly of his beliefs.\n\nThe thought of the Reichsmarschall swinging from a meat hook, gasping for breath as the piano wire slowly sliced into his fat neck, filled Heydrich with pleasure. Yet it was not meant to be. The corpulent slug had crunched on cyanide in his cell rather than face the jeering crowds. No matter. Heydrich looked back at the slender corpse before him. The execution of young Edda Göring had sent the appropriate message."

The unit has made extensive use of its infiltration training, mostly avoiding detection. Aerial reconnaissance has been deployed to no avail - PGD1 is clearly avoiding the open countryside.\n\nForward panzer elements are believed to have made contact and engaged in combat with a PGD1 rearguard unit south-west of Germania. The precise nature of this engagement is yet to be confirmed, owing to the complete destruction of the units involved. Initial assessments indicate that our men were struck while resting, most likely by a force composed solely of leg infantry to facilitate a stealthy approach. All man-portable supplies were stripped from our troops, and their vehicles sabotaged.\n\nPGD1 remains under the command of Oberst Ulrich Wegener. Following the capture of Germania, it must be assumed that he is acting autonomously, without directives from any officer of higher rank. Contrary to our hopes, we believe that this may make PGD1 a more potent force in the field; the absence of constraints on the unit's conduct, combined with their extreme degree of training and absolute opposition to the Führer, means that we can expect PGD1 to violently hamper our efforts at every opportunity.\n\nFurther assessment to be made, pending successful gathering of intelligence at the Führer's direction.\n\nHEIL HEYDRICH"

Our forces in Gau Pommern face constant harassment, ambushes and raids. Supply convoys consistently fail to reach their destinations, patrols fail to report in and our reconnaissance elements frequently go missing themselves.\n\nOn the few occasions when our forces have brought PGD1 to open battle, the outcome has proven no better. Despite being cut off from major sources of supply, they have supplemented their reserves by pillaging our own supplies and being as conservative as possible. The result of open battles tends to be that our units suffer heavy casualties on initial contact, then hold position to await reinforcements. While doing so, PGD1's forces slip away, making gains at our expense alone.\n\nThe situation in Pommern has deteriorated to the point where we cannot be certain of the feasibility of continued operations there. Civilian opposition to our authority remains high, in part due to positive public perceptions of PGD1. Crackdowns did not work as anticipated - the populace believes that they are protected from us by PGD1, which may not be an incorrect sentiment. Our position in Pommern is therefore extremely precarious. PGD1 has free reign over the entire gau and will doubtless make full use of that advantage.\n\nHEIL HEYDRICH"

The DPSG had no oath of their own, so the German members of the network had defaulted to using the Polish one as their code word before meetings.\n\nKazimierz nodded, satisfied with his recitation. "Speak freely, friend." The German was a younger man, and Kazimierz silently reflected on the bravery of his parents, to raise such a young rebel. It was one thing to risk your life for a people that were not your own, but to raise a child willing to do so in the midst of so much Nazi hatred in his schools and streets was remarkable.\n\nThe young German, clearly somewhat frazzled, began to speak. "Herr, with the victory of Heydrich, many things have changed in Germany. The German Civil War has robbed the SS of the ability to maintain control over the overstretched Reich, including Danzig. I think that, with proper preparations, we could make a move. Sir." He spoke nervously, as if he was a bit frightened he would be reprimanded.\n\nKazimierz's mind immediately began to race. He had friends in the Polish Resistance, people he had known from his youth and a few he had seen in the camps. He could contact them for aid. They had risen up while Germany was distracted. Was it so wild, he thought, so implausible for his own networks to do the same?\n\nAs Kazimierz began to plot and plan his next move, the young German gave the scout salute. Kazimierz, already hardening his heart for the trials ahead, returned it with a smile. "You have done well. When all of Europe is free, I will see a medal on you, friend."

Soon after, Heinrich Himmler began his speech, declaring German-Burgundian relations 'restored with an alliance to destroy degeneracy where it stands' among other things.\n\nWhile German-Burgundian relations have soared, the rest of the world has reacted in sharp condemnation, looking on in horror.

When the Burgundians send recommendations for the reformation of the state into her natural Aryan structure, we must begin radically restructuring immediately for the good of the Aryan race. Of course, when true orders come in we must do more than immediately follow them. We must become discipline.

Already they had sectioned off half of the plaza-space enough for exactly four helicopters to safely land if need be-to themselves and their single vehicle. In front of it stood Werner Grothmann, still as a statue in a perfect SS uniform. Heydrich could smell toad as he approached, but said nothing. Grothmann was close to Himmler, and worthy of respect for that, if nothing else.\n\n"Heil Himmler! Heil mein Führer!" Grothmann shouted above the helicopter with a proud salute, which Heydrich returned in kind. He could tell immediately that Grothmann was searching for a reaction to the order of names, but if he wanted one then he'd have been disappointed. Heydrich was above the petty politics and ambitions of junior officers.\n\nGrothmann folded his hands behind his back and looked to the Reichstag.

Instead the man just sat and stared at Heydrich's face, blinking exactly seven times every minute-besides one where he only blinked six - in order to see if the puppet Führer reacted with horror or awe.\n\nInstead he got nothing, most likely as he expected.

If the German people were to learn of this betrayal of Spartanism, they would surely doubt the convictions of their Führer. If Himmler knew, he would know that Heydrich's heart was already set against him, and any hope of stopping his demented schemes would be dashed.\n\nAnd yet, Himmler remained away in Ost-Paris, furthering his own directives in pursuit of his grand plan. How long until he would notice Heydrich's loyalty had begun to wane? How long could the facade be kept up? A year, perhaps, before Himmler's expectations did not match reality. Heydrich thought. He glanced disgustedly at the bottle of wine, which was almost empty. Perhaps two years, if he kept his base impulses in check. Nevertheless, he refilled his glass.\n\nWho could he trust to aid him? That was a difficult question indeed. Himmler's plans were insane, yes, but Himmler's men were loyal to a fault. They had been chosen not for skill, but because they believed in Himmler's vision. Heydrich had believed in that vision once as well, until Grothmann had shown him the horror of it all. Now, he was not certain.\n\nHe would tell a member of his inner circle first, to be certain that these thoughts were not unique to him. It would have to be Bouhler, D'Alquen, Frank, or Gille. He did not trust that the others would not run to Himmler. But which of the four would be most likely to see the truth, and the need to act upon it?\n\nHe thought at once of Bouhler. A committed National Socialist, as devoted to the new world order as any man Heydrich had ever known. But Heydrich knew that Bouhler had served on the Commission of National Socialist Literature for a long time. Furthermore, he knew it brought Bouhler joy to collect all sorts of books, pursuing knowledge wherever he could find it. With all the undiscovered writings scattered across the world, Heydrich could not see the man ever consenting to see it all destroyed. Not even if it secured the Reich one thousand more years."

If Bouhler betrayed him, or if Bouhler proved unable to do what was required of him, he would need to be disposed of immediately.\n\nAlready, he was beginning to see what he thought might be signs of distress on Bouhler's face. If he gave even a hint of a reaction, then it was a mistake to have trusted him. Heydrich's thoughts again returned to the pistol. Anyone could ruin it all with a single word or glance out of place. Stopping the plan had to come first, and if Bouhler proved to be a hindrance... Heydrich had brought the weapon for a reason.\n\nSeemingly finished reading, Bouhler looked up at Heydrich, his eyes wide and his brow creased in worry and confusion. "My Führer... What is this document?" He looked at Heydrich, as if desperate to be assured it was all a lie or a joke.\n\nHeydrich was on his feet in an instant. "Shut your mouth." He hissed, leaning over the bespectacled man with a look of utter loathing in his eyes. "If Himmler catches even a hint of this, we will both be dead men, with no chance at stopping this. That is, if I do not have you shot first for such incompetence. This changes nothing for you. You will act, speak, and think as you normally do, until such time as your Führer gives you orders to do so. Is that clear?"\n\nBouhler took a moment to compose himself, before nodding. "Yes, my Führer." Heydrich could see in his eyes that he was still in a state of panic, but at the very least he was exercising some amount of self-restraint.\n\n"You are dismissed.

This is a matter that requires the utmost secrecy from each of you. The survival of the Reich will depend on it."\n\nHeydrich folded his hands atop the desk. "You should all be aware of what needs to be done, if we want to uphold the truth of National Socialism." With a nod from his Führer, Bouhler began to hand each of his fellows an envelope.

Almost all were fat, and one had been so bold as to offer Heydrich a cigarette.\n\nGille and Bouhler were doing most of the talking, something that the Führer was thankful for. They spoke at length about how Himmler planned to bring ruin to the Reich, and how Heydrich needed their help to save National Socialism. They did not mention anything about Himmler's true plan, at Heydrich's request. These men did not seem to require that knowledge to be convinced.\n\nThey were trying to work with traitors. These were not men who had seen the madness hiding behind Himmler's veneer of brilliance, but men who seemed to be willing to reject that brilliance at face value. These men did not care for anything that was right in the world, but for what benefited themselves. How could he justify working with them, even for the survival of the world?\n\nHeydrich was lost deep in thought about this, having lost track of the long-winded conversation. His head elsewhere, he absentmindedly set his hand against his leg. A sharp pain burned into him, and the Führer winced. Bouhler looked back, frantic. "My Führer, are you alright?" Heydrich dismissed him with a wave and an annoyed glare. That had only served to draw attention to it.\n\nAs Gille and Bouhler resumed their pleas, Heydrich stared at the now crushed cigarette in his hand. Its mark still throbbed against his leg. He had accepted it without a thought, when a year ago he would have instantly thrown it to the ground and ordered these officers shot. Who was Heydrich to doubt the integrity of others, when he had been rejecting the Spartan way for weeks?"

While most of the SS had initially hoped them dead or combat ineffective, scattered reports from northern Germany have for weeks signaled the opposite. Highly coordinated and precise strikes against SS forces, missing or destroyed supplies, bridges and highways being found in ruins left and right.\n\nFor weeks, SS anti-partisan forces across the whole of Pomerania have suffered setback after setback, and following weeks of humiliating defeat, SS forces have begun to retreat as if running from the devil himself. Already much of the northern coast has been turned over to the insurgents, and it will doubtlessly be a bloody struggle to attempt to dislodge them."

The world had taken so much of a toll on him that he had long since forgotten true joy like this, even if desperation and dread muddied its foundations. The spent shell casing lying next to his feet and the trail of blood on the wall behind him that accompanied the slumped body of a dead German soldier was as clear a sign as any that a rebellion had begun- and not only begun, but grown and thrived. The cheer of thousands awaited him beyond the set of shot-out double-doors in front of him that led out onto a stone balcony.\n\nWith a heave, Piechowski raised himself from the chair and triumphantly opened out to a light wind of Königsberg hitting against his body, and the frenzied cry of liberation ringing through his ears as he looked across the countless there to listen to him speak. The smallest of smiles, an ill-afforded luxury, came across Piechowski's face.\n\n"Remember my friends, my brothers and sisters!" He began, putting one free hand on the grainy stone surface in front of him while the other held a death grip on his weapon. "Today is the day we mark as the first victory for a free people! Free from the maniacal grip of the Reich! Free of the monstrous SS! Free from our oppressors! Here, destiny's chains have been broken, and it falls into our hands to guide it towards the flickering light that may give us salvation!" The next breath he took felt ragged, and liquid pooled at the corners of his eyes. It had been a long time since he felt so happy and so afraid at the same time.\n\nAs a thousand and more voices screamed in agony, in terrified fright, in hope, in the most doubtless hint of optimism that finally began to bloom, Piechowski raised his rifle high in the air, and a hundred guns followed.

Heydrich, now Führer of the Reich, was not... amiable, as he used to be. The distance between them had widened to become a largely professional relationship a decade prior, but even by that measure Heydrich was unusually distant.\n\nHimmler tapped an idle finger against the diary resting in his lap, unopened and blank for the first time in years. Perhaps it was mere humanity weighing Heydrich down? The duty of great men was always burdensome - doubly so when it violated all moral norms. Setting those obstacles aside was the sacrifice they had both chosen to make in order to solve the Jewish question, that no future generations of Aryans would be oppressed or have vengeance visited upon them. The new plan, the final solution for all the world's evils, was no different.\n\nSo where was Heydrich's iron resolve? Where was the quiet zeal that had guided him at Wannsee? Victory had been achieved over decadent National Socialism - the new Führer's failings were forgiven, and now they could fulfil the divine destiny of their race. Once the bunkers were complete and a large enough nuclear arsenal assembled, the future would be assured forever! No more Jews, no more Slavs, no more sadness, anger or envy!\n\nWas Heydrich stalling for something? He couldn't possibly-\n\nHimmler's tapping finger froze. The thought was unbidden, absurd. Even with the Führer's previous recalcitrance... was it possible?\n\nThe master of Burgundy reached for his black telephone with a hand turned cold and clammy.

Names were scrawled on the paper in bright red: "Arische Volksfront", "SS-Ordensstaat Lothringen", "Leibstandarte Heinrich Himmler". Messy scrawling marked where the map had been updated in a hurry as the situation deteriorated.\n\nFor a capital, he possessed the charred carcass of a half-finished city and a patch of land short on industry and agriculture alike. The rest of his rightful territory was split and scattered - an industrial zone here, some garrisons, a few gaus still linked up - but it was gradually falling away. SS, Wehrmacht remnants, dissident groups, even slaves - all had staked their claims before he could even blink. Even the SS, by law his army alone, was engaged in mass mutiny and separatism.\n\nMonths spent fighting a horrendously destructive war against degeneracy. Millions dead. The heimat in ruins.

Civilians, forced to instead begin their daily commute on foot, were then instructed into their homes at roadblocks along the Prachtallee, where many would have caught glimpses of armored vehicles speeding down the parade grounds toward the Reichstag.\n\nFor the soldiers at the capital building - the hand selected men of Heydrich who had been expecting the attack - this was nothing but an inevitably, and they were more than ready.\n\nWatching from the windows, witnesses would have been able to see the first vehicle in the convoy explode as a COBRA rocket launched from the upper windows of the Reichstag met its mark. A second one soon impacted the last vehicle in the convoy, and as the soldiers in the back attempted to evacuate their vehicles they were immediately met with heavy, overlapping machine gun fire.\n\nAs SS units outside of the Reichstag began firing at SS units inside of it, the noise of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city much like it had only a few months prior.\n\nTo those loyal to Heinrich Himmler in the city, it soon became clear this was not an average day, and that this was not a successful coup.

Those loyal to Heydrich had already moved their armbands to the opposite arm to differentiate themselves, but in the hectic environment of the battlefield that was often lost. Friendly fire was as common as enemy fire, and both sides often seemed confused over what exactly they were fighting over. One thing was for sure though, one side had been ordered to eliminate Heydrich, and the other would not allow it.\n\nIn the midst of battle, two separate detachments of Burgundians broke off and began rapid movement to two separate locations. One of them was an armory filled to the brim with weaponry recovered from the battle with Speidel's forces, which would be indispensable to Heydrich's forces. The other detachment moved with all haste to Spandau, where Hans Speidel and his general staff had been imprisoned, with orders to immediately liquidate anyone inside.\n\nNearby both units, one Hauptsturmführer Victor Sommer began demanding orders of which location to save.

In the ensuing battle in the prison, Sommer made the decision to arm Hans Speidel and his imprisoned staff, and with the extra numbers they managed to repulse the Burgundians and annihilate the remains of the attack force.\n\nWhile Sommer and his men initially celebrated, they were soon interrupted by the sounds of the explosions rippling across the city from several blocks away-shattering windows for miles.\n\nThe armory was gone."

The Burgundians, over the course of an hour, leveraged their superior numbers to overwhelm the bridge's defenders and managed to quite nearly cross it when Sommer ordered his men to detonate the demolition charges they had planted and drop the bridge-with him on it.\n\nThe Burgundians were forced to retreat, and Sommer's surviving men managed to unite with nearby friendly forces to reinforce the defenses at the armory.

Grothmann shouted as he was dragged out from the basement of a small store, where several of his men had been cornered and killed minutes ago, their blood still warm around Heydrich's boot soles. "He's going to have you killed, Heydrich, you madman. Once you're dead he'll have me killed too for not seeing this sooner.

Arranged haphazardly on his desk was a mountain of documents and photographs collected from the SS archives, comprising every piece of information accessible to him. Still, he knew it wasn't comprehensive enough. He stubbed out his eighteenth cigarette of the night and immediately lit another, struggling for a moment with the lighter and almost dropping it from trembling fingers.\n\nHeydrich had the names: Mohnke, de la Mazière, Degrelle, Eicke, Fegelein and many more besides. Traitors in many ways, he supposed. Hitler certainly wouldn't have approved of this factionalism - would he? He'd always played his subordinates against one another, but Himmler had maintained the line that the SS was an independent and undivided entity. How long had that been a lie for? Since the formation of Burgundy, or longer?\n\nEven then, the splits weren't against the leadership. These small, petty men, vying for power - they were just doing what the NSDAP had always done under Hitler. Power grabs wherever they could be made, two-faced diplomacy and paranoia, all for the sake of career advancement. Darwinism in the political sphere. Despite that, any of them could still be in Himmler's pocket. The Reichsführer had been playing a long game for years, and Heydrich had just months to catch up at most. Every move had to be decisive in order to rip his possible allies cleanly from Burgundy's grasp.\n\nHeydrich dropped the stub of his cigarette, not noticing that the ashtray was overflowing again."

"So long as you stand against Himmler, I will be with you, but I can't speak for anyone else unless they're under my command."\n\nHeydrich resisted the urge to grind his teeth in frustration. "Yes, yes." He set down the last file his secretary had passed him and took up the phone in a free hand again. "This is going to be hell, Speidel. You're asking that I try to undo thirty years of the Heer's damned sectarianism in the space of a few conversations."\n\nA tense moment followed, and Heydrich regretted the choice of words for the briefest fraction of a second. "Distrust runs both ways, Heydrich," Speidel replied without a hint of insincerity. "It can be undone in the same fashion. If you can't trust them, trust my judgement, at least. They all serve Germany in the end. Use that to unite them, not your office."\n\nHeydrich grunted as a farewell and dropped the receiver into its hook. Trust? Trust hadn't existed in his lexicon until recently. Distrust was part and parcel of intelligence work, for nobody save one's superior was ever above suspicion. Where would Hitler have ended up if he continued to trust that pig Röhm? Not as the ruler of Europe, surely. Trust was for the unimaginative, for... family, he supposed. He trusted Lina, mostly. His progeny, definitely. His subordinates, more or less.\n\nBut these names? He picked up the folder that had given him pause a few minutes prior and almost made him hang up on Speidel for the implication: Piechowski, Kazimierz. A Pole and a slave, leader of a rebellion in Prussia. The others - Gehlen, Steinhoff, Wegener - those were German names, at least, but this?\n\nIf this was the fruit of trust, it was bitter indeed.

I have a full report prepared, as you have requested."\n\nHeydrich pinched his nose and tried not to sigh as a headache began to throb behind his eyes. "Thank you, Degrelle. In brief, please." He lit up a morning cigarette to brace himself for bad news.\n\n"The Walloon Legion stands at one hundred percent strength. We face no equipment shortages currently, and our armored contingent is in full working order. Morale is high. Domestic opposition within Belgian territory has been minimal, and the traitors have yet to infringe on our lands. However, I require assistance to raise more men, as we lack adequate arms production here."\n\n"Good," remarked Heydrich, pleased to hear of at least one positive development. "Has there been any dissent in the Legion?"\n\nHe heard Degrelle spit. "Only a pair of Himmlerite swine, unfit to serve. They have been dealt with. The rest of the men are with me, and therefore with you, my Führer."\n\nWorryingly positive, Heydrich thought. Nothing that good happened without strings attached, surely? Perhaps Hitler's judgement of Degrelle still held up after all. "Your loyalty is commendable, Standartenführer. It's... heartening to know that the Walloons are true as ever. Still, I must ask, Degrelle: is this so clear-cut for you? We face a second civil war. Are you prepared for that? Prepared to face what might be the end of your nation and all others?"\n\nThere was no moment of silence on the other end of the line.

 HGR.208.d:0 "Heydrich's face was impassive, but internally he was more than a little disappointed with his little list as he re-read it. Skorzeny, Dietrich, Fegelein, Henlein and whoever was in charge of the Waffen-SS nowadays. Not an impressive collection of possible loyalists, by any means.\n\nSkorzeny and Dietrich wouldn't be hard to sway. They were true military men with no patience for politics. The latter was behaving very erratically in recent months, but Skorzeny was as professional as they came. Though a devoted National Socialist, he'd probably even work for the damned Jews if their terms were good enough.\n\nFegelein was a rat, plain and simple - a sniveling, arrogant little rodent who only held his position by virtue of marriage into power and sickening servility. He hid from Himmler behind propaganda, and from society's judgement behind his wife's skirts. Pathetic, but the propaganda machine he was operating out of Dresden could be useful.\n\nHenlein wasn't likeable in the slightest. Heydrich recalled their very unpleasant disputes back in the 40s, when he'd purged the Sudetenland NSDAP and Gauleiter Henlein's staff. Now he was operating some kind of renewed Lebensborn program. Reports were flooding in from Bouhler's office of both German and Bohemian women being abducted or conscripted at gunpoint into 'reproductive facilities'. A bit much, even in the name of the Aryan race.\n\nFinally, there was the Waffen-SS. Still mercenary in many ways, there had allegedly been some kind of power struggle recently. Gille had asserted that he would have no difficulty reining them in, but had yet to confirm his success. That was more than a little concerning - to have such a substantial portion of the Waffen in Himmler's camp would be nothing short of disastrous.\n\nThe Führer sighed and set the list down, leaning onto his desk to rest his weary head.

"What is the status of non-SS elements in the Reich?"\n\nSpeidel's face remained calm as he walked over to the desk, despite the twinge of distaste that accompanied every word from Heydrich's mouth. "Status is excellent. Better than the SS, at least." No reaction from the Führer on that - curious. "Wegener's division holds firm in Pomerania, with strong support from the local population." He tapped on their location upon the map of Germany, which had been highlighted in black. "Here," he continued, shifting his finger south, "Steinhoff and the remainders of the Luftwaffe have coalesced around air bases in Lower Bavaria. They're experiencing supply shortages, but still control most of the air fleet and some aircraft factories. Then there's-"\n\n"Enough," Heydrich interrupted with a wave of his hand. "I'll read your report later. What I need to know right now is how we bring these old friends of yours into our camp." He looked up again, eyes hollow, as they had been for weeks. "We are short on time, Speidel. Tell me so I can get it done before they get any ideas of their own."\n\nSpeidel thought for a moment, then shrugged. "Tell them you stand against Himmler.

The Führer stirred from slumber and raised his head, squinting against the golden rays shining in.\n\nHe stood and strode over to draw the curtains, blinking sleep from his eyes. It wouldn't do to fall behind on such a basic physical need, but the work - so much work. Organizing the extermination of millions had been simple compared to the task before him now. Back then, everything had been simpler; the Führerprinzip and his trust in Himmler guided his hand, raising him ever higher in Hitler's estimation. Then came the coup - the pointless fucking coup - that had thrown everything into doubt for the first time in his life. The Wehrmacht wouldn't work with him, Himmler thought him a failure, and the Führer himself... well, his trust remained, but that wasn't worth much given his growing senility.\n\nAs he sat and flicked the lamp on, his eyes caught on the silver skull of his SS cap perched on the corner of his desk. He picked it up and regarded it idly, running a thumb over the polished metal warmed by sunlight. Once, that symbol had struck fear into the hearts of everyone from Dublin to Moscow. It had stood for ruthlessness, cold-hearted efficiency and the absolute mastery of the Aryan race. Then, it had become associated solely with Himmler's treason, and finally Heydrich's own.\n\nEven if he succeeded in casting down Burgundy, what would it mean in the future? Would it speak of the great treachery of the Führer himself, who allied with insurgents and traitors to destroy National Socialism and the Reich? Perhaps, if all went well, it would come to mean unity and the triumph of Germany.\n\nBut in that moment, feeling treason's weight upon his shoulders, Heydrich couldn't imagine anything so agreeable."

For a moment, Heydrich entertained himself with an image of the Führer in his prime. "Germany, motherland of us all, beset by treason!" he would have bellowed. "Yet our flame remains undiminished! The fire of the great Germanic race, those inheritors of Alexander, Caesar and Charlemagne - it cannot be extinguished by the encroaching darkness, no matter how many brave souls perish in its defense!"\n\nThe image faded, however, as reality crept back in. Hitler was long dead - that incarnation of him, even more so. Germany's paragon had aged so rapidly after the attempted SS coup that it shocked even Heydrich. Physically, he had never been impressive - nor even Aryan-looking - but he had sparked the fire of National Socialism and led his people to greatness. How could he have been anything but Aryan? Yet, Heydrich had to admit it was a disquieting thought; was that how he would end his days too? Withered and fragile, without even the strength to raise his own arm in salute?\n\nHe thought of another Hitler then: one who had never come to be, but certainly could have. A Hitler screaming in undignified frustration, castigating his generals for their failure as the British, French and Bolsheviks closed on Berlin. Heydrich thought of the old man's fury turning upon him, demanding to know why he, the perfect Aryan, had failed, while the servants of Jewry and Bolshevism waxed strong over Germany's ruins.\n\nHeydrich pushed the thought from his mind, but knew it would return time and again."

He felt as though he had entered a ridiculous spy movie. The pages kept turning and the man's rictus grin faded away into a look of deep concentration. He returned the document, shook his head, and melted back into the shadows."

 HGR.216.d:0 "Rats, as the saying goes, often flee the sinking ship. Very rarely do they crawl out from their vile little hiding holes to take control of the wheel.\n\nHeydrich flicked through the intelligence report with his slender fingers, shaking his head in disbelief. Like the Pied Piper of legend, Reinhard Gehlen had enticed Bormannite and Speerite vermin to follow his lead through an underground network of resistance. Now, with the aid of his loyal Abwehr operatives, the man had seized the city of Ravenburg for himself.\n\nIn all his modesty, Gehlen had declared the antiquated city as the 'Deutsches Reich' and the final bastion of true National Socialism. In other circumstances, Heydrich would have snorted in derision and tossed the report into the bin. After all, he was a man of cold logic and calculation. Yet as he continued to read, the urge to tear the document into shreds burned within him. How could degenerate liberals and stagnant conservatives claim to represent the Aryan race?\n\nMuch of the report included speculation. There were claims that Gerhard Klopfer was leading the Bormannite bureaucrats, while the Speerite fascists had rallied behind Theodore Oberländer. Wehrmacht veterans and radical students were allegedly rallying together, preaching orthodoxy and reform in turn. How much could Heydrich believe?\n\nHeydrich took a deep breath. Emotions were a sign of weakness. A sign of devolution. An emotional man would order the entire city razed to the ground, to burn out the rot of corruption and decay festering within. An Aryan man would consider all options. Gehlen's Reich was a potential ally. For now, the world was at stake."

You will be accompanied by two of my guards, who have orders to terminate you immediately if you unseal the folder. Do you understand?"\n\nHauptsturmführer Schneider nodded without a hint of fear on his face as he took the red folder in both hands. "I understand, my Führer."\n\n"Good," continued Heydrich. "This may be a one-way journey, if Remer is so inclined. In that instance, I will see that your family receives a higher pension. Good luck, Hauptsturmführer." He saluted. "Sieg heil!"\n\n"Heil Heydrich!" Schneider replied, one arm out straight and the other clutching the folder tightly. He turned and strode from the room, with the chosen two guards at his back with rifles shouldered.\n\n"I can't say I share your faith in Remer, Heydrich," sighed Speidel from his seat by the window. "He was the real driving force behind the militarists, even more than Schörner. He probably hates you more than anyone else apart from Himmler."\n\nHeydrich scoffed. "I have faith in no man, Speidel. That aside, so long as his hate for Himmler eclipses any of his other interests, I believe he'll serve us well. This certainly isn't any more irrational than any of... your proposals."\n\nSpeidel didn't respond. Instead, he just scowled, made his excuses, and thought of that mad glint which had ever been in Remer's eyes."

"Hauptsturmführer, are you absolutely certain of your account? Will it be necessary for me to take the pliers to you myself?"\n\n"No, my Führer!" blurted Schneider in deferential fear unbecoming of his previous attitude. "Please, ask the others - even the pilot heard it! General Remer is with Himmler! I couldn't believe it myself, but it's true!"\n\nHeydrich bit back his desire to castigate the cowering officer and send him to the penal battalion, instead relaxing his posture slightly and leaning back. "Fine, Schneider. I suppose there isn't cause to doubt your story. Guards, confine him for the time being. Protective custody. Bring his family in, too."\n\nAs a glum but somewhat thankful Schneider was escorted from the Reich Chancellery, Heydrich suppressed a scream of frustration and tossed the officer's report into the fire. With Himmler?! Otto Ernst Remer, the maddest of the man among the Heer's rabid dogs, a Burgundian? What for? He loathed them, like he loathed everyone beyond the borders of...\n\nThen it hit him. Hate could do strange things to a man - and, just like his newfound ally, Remer overflowed with it.\n\nMany miles away, in Ost-Paris, Heinrich Himmler picked up his black telephone as he looked over Remer's file. Yes, he would do. "Herr Remer?" he asked as someone picked up on the other end of the line. "Reichsführer Himmler. I understand you wish to discuss a plan for the greater benefit of our race.""

We believe that most of them were neutralized in targeted assassinations, and Schörner might even be the last of the old clique still alive."\n\nHeydrich scratched his unshaven chin, mulling over the possibility of reaching out to Schörner. True, he had been the greatest enemy of the SS after that disgusting weasel Speer, but that enmity was generally directed at Burgundy rather than the Deutsche-SS. "Do you think he would work with us, Speidel?" he asked, carefully watching the man's reaction.\n\nInterestingly, there wasn't even a flicker of distaste on his bespectacled features as he gave his response. "Without a doubt. He might be bloodthirsty, brutal, short-tempered, cruel and borderline insane, but Schörner isn't stupid. He wants to conquer the world, not torch it."\n\n"In that case, do you recommend aiding him?"\n\nAh. There it was. The slight twitch of the eye that marked Speidel's very restrained anger. "Yes, I do. Anyone in the Heer not with me is with him. We need the manpower he can bring to our side."\n\nHeydrich steepled his fingers. "Very good, then. Dismissed. I'll spare you the indignity of handling him."\n\n"Godspeed, Heydrich," Speidel remarked as he turned to leave. "Make sure you don't take half-measures with this one.""

"I take it that you have dealt with Herr Remer in a manner befitting his actions?"\n\n"One moment, Heydrich," came a coarse voice from the other end. "Bring him here." There was a rustling and what sounded like boots being dragged across floorboards. "Do you have something to say to the Führer, you fucking rat? Well?" A fist smacked into flesh, eliciting a muffled yelp. Heydrich, not one for self-indulgent violence, took a seat and waited for Schörner to finish.\n\n"My Führer!" Remer screamed in the background. "Please, I'll-"\n\nThen - a gunshot. Then half a dozen more, followed by the faint sound of a pistol clicking on empty. "There," huffed Schörner. "Dealt with. I'll be in Germania in the morning.

Not to mention the bastard was late as always. Speidel had seen his helicopter land outside some ten minutes prior, but evidently the Field Marshal was taking the scenic route.\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes' wait, the clomping of dirty combat boots on marble tiles began to echo up the hallway, preceding the arrival of the bloodiest tyrant in the Heer. Grizzled, thin-faced and unkempt, Schörner clearly hadn't bothered to clean up before coming - indeed, Speidel could see blood on his right sleeve which probably wasn't his own.\n\n"Schörner." he said curtly.\n\n"Speidel." came the equally unenthusiastic response.\n\nThere was a long moment of tension between the two. The SS guards behind Speidel remained straight-backed and passive, as did the pair of Panzergrenadiers tailing Schörner. Finally, both spoke simultaneously, understanding each other perfectly: "Later."\n\nWith that, the guards were dismissed and Speidel turned to throw the doors open.

"Welcome to my humble gau, my Führer!"\n\nHeydrich returned the salute. "Heil." There were a group of women standing behind Henlein, faces lowered in deference. All wore traditional clothing, and spaced out around them were what looked to be armed militia. "And these good ladies are...?"\n\n"Our finest volunteers of the Lebensborn program, my Führer," explained Henlein with a smile. He patted one of them on the shoulder. "All bearers of fine Aryan children, I assure you." Heydrich noticed that most of them appeared to be in the early stage of pregnancy. As to their Aryan-ness - or their willingness to serve - his agents had shared their doubts. Henlein continued, oblivious to the Führer's quiet glare. "I thought it best for you to see the fruits of our program, started as it was on my own initiative. Of course, it would have been better if our fair volunteers had some lovely sons and daughters to show you already, but nature hurries for no man, does she?"\n\n"Indeed," muttered Heydrich, trying not to think about his daughters standing where the 'volunteers' stood. "Your initiative is admirable, Gauleiter. Perhaps I have... misjudged you in the past."\n\nHenlein's smile widened disconcertingly. "What's done is done, my Führer.

A maternity-obsessed Sudetenlander who'd already dubbed himself first gauleiter, then Reichsprotektor without approval from Germania? He doubted it, but what other choice was there? The protectorate would provide food, guns, tanks, planes and whatever else he needed; its industry would be a massive boon, and yet...\n\nOnce again, he closed his eyes and tried not to think about Henlein's pet program.

 HGR.224.t:0 "The Eagle's Nest"
 HGR.224.d:0 "Heydrich had always used the meeting spot more than the Führer it had been built for. Hitler had never liked heights, and as he ailed, he thought the thin mountain air would serve to send him to an early grave. His hangers-on, meanwhile, preferred to stay in Germania where they could weasel their way into every political dealing or going on that occurred. Heydrich, comfortable that the Führer would not have replaced him because of it, made infrequent visits to the Kehlsteinhaus.\n\nPeiper had already been waiting for him in the foyer. Heydrich wordlessly sat as his old friend poured him a cup of tea. For a moment, Heydrich allowed himself to think that they were back in the olden days, having a leisurely chat about nothing of consequence. That was not the case. "I'm afraid there are some things I must share with you, Jochen. Grave things."\n\nHeydrich gingerly withdrew the folder containing Himmler's grand plan, offering it to Peiper. Pieper shook his head, pushing the folder back towards Heydrich without so much as a glance. "I know. I've known for years, now. Since soon after the war."\n\nHeydrich's soft gaze hardened into a glare, as the words cut deep. Himmler, the bastard, had told Peiper before him. Who else had known? Josias? Von Ribbentrop? Who else had Himmler trusted more than his prized lieutenant? His voice was a growl. "I suppose you've been aiding him then? Working with madmen and lunatics to doom the world?"\n\n"No." For the first time in years, Heydrich saw fear creep into his old friend's eyes, as he pleaded with the Führer. "I wanted the chance to stop him, Reinhard. But I could not on my own. It was impossible."\n\nAs Heydrich looked upon Peiper in this state, someone he had long looked up to, he felt nothing but a rush of disgust. Cowardice was not a good look for a military man, nor a good trait in an ally. Peiper had behaved like a disgrace to the Aryan race and National Socialism, and would have continued to do so had Heydrich not risen against Himmler. For a moment, the Führer considered putting this worm, once his friend, out of his misery."

 HGR.225.d:0 "The Kommandostab was secure in friendly hands. The Deutsche-SS, having gained a significant amount of sway during the Civil War, had quickly thrown their support behind Heydrich when the lines were crossed. Those members of the SS overtly loyal to Himmler had, for the most part, joined him in Burgundian exile. The SS in Germany had proven their loyalty to the true Führer. Gille had already moved to take command of the region and the currently leaderless organization that occupied it.\n\nOut of all the men who could have assumed control over the Waffen-SS in this time of crisis, Heydrich was certainly grateful it was Herbert Otto Gille who had emerged victorious. For as much as Bouhler did in advancing Heydrich's plans, Gille had always been significantly sturdier. The general was also one of the only SS men left that Heydrich truly trusted.\n\nThough of course his aid would be missed in Heydrich's own inner circle, the Führer had decided Gille could do more to stop Himmler's plan by ensuring the Waffen-SS's somewhat questionable loyalty. A stab in the back was the last thing Heydrich needed now. Regardless, how could the Kommandostab keep order in their lands without a commander?\n\nAnd yet, Heydrich almost regretted sending Gille away. For as full of doubts and questions as the Führer was, Gille had been nothing but stalwart and dutiful in obeying him. He had not even questioned Heydrich's departure from Himmler, nor his deviation from those National Socialist ideals. Gille almost seemed, at times, to convince Heydrich of the truth within his own ideas and actions, when he was struck by doubt. Now, Heydrich faced the greater challenge of having to convince himself."

 HGR.226.t:0 "An Adequate Commander"
 HGR.226.d:0 "Though the man had been one of the most decorated lieutenants in the Waffen-SS, Sylvester Stadler had never piqued Heydrich's interest. Despite the somewhat cordial working relationship that they shared, Heydrich had never expected a friendship with the man would prove useful, or even enjoyable. Now, with Stadler having seized control of the Waffen-SS, Heydrich found himself wondering if only a few kind words or a bit more recognition would have sparked the loyalty necessary for Stadler to turn his Kommandostab to the Führer's side.\n\nInstead, Stadler seemed to be at an impasse. Heydrich did not know if the man truly could not decide between himself and Himmler, or if he wished to carve out in the Kommandostab's lands a fief of his own. The conscripts in the Waffen-SS were more loyal to those that paid them than any concept of Germany or Burgundy, and Stadler was known to pay his men well.\n\nThe only solace Heydrich found was that Himmler had found Stadler equally dull, if not more so. He did not expect the Kommandostab to go running into the Burgundian embrace any time soon, which allowed Heydrich plenty of time to persuade Stadler to obey his Führer. In time, the Kommandostab would find itself back in the Reich, obeying order from those who ought to give them. If not, Heydrich supposed that they would have to perish alongside the other traitors."

 HGR.227.t:0 "The Madman's Dog"
 HGR.227.d:0 "For years, Bormann, Speer, and the rest of Germany had called Heydrich a spineless puppet, loyal to whatever Himmler wanted. They ought to have counted themselves lucky, as they did not have the displeasure of encountering Paul Hausser. His loyalty to Himmler was only matched by his reluctance to live out the Spartanist dogma that he preached. A toad in every sense of the word, Hausser had never been someone Heydrich trusted. He had wondered for years why Himmler kept him in power, and now he finally knew. Hausser was too utterly brainless and madly sycophantic to protest Himmler's plan.\n\nHausser had taken control of the Waffen-SS, following the chaos that had descended over Germany in the recent months. Heydrich had been foolish, to allow the Burgundians to sink their claws so deep into the organization. Himmler's dogs in the Burgundische-SS had been pulling the strings for months, after Heydrich had handed them the reins during the civil war. Had they been preparing for such a takeover, even before they knew of Heydrich's intentions?\n\nNow, Himmler's most foolish minion sat on a glass throne in the Kommandostab. Heydrich would need to shatter it if he were to ever secure his regime. He did not think it would be too difficult, however. For all the concern that Hausser paid to his image, Heydrich knew he was uniquely unpopular. The hardliners thought him soft, and the reformists thought him far too harsh. It would only require a small push to unseat this rodent, and then a more loyal man could find himself in that position. Heydrich was already beginning to consider his options."

We arrived in Posen late last night. The operation went off without many complications, and the administration across Hausser's Kommandostab has been usurped by loyal members of the Deutsch-SS and Waffen-SS." Bouhler announced, his voice monotonous. "Paul Hausser and his rouge agents in the Burgundische-SS are in captivity, and insurgents are actively being rooted out. We await your order. Heil Heydrich!" Bouhler eyed the bottom of the note. "It is then signed by Herbert Otto Gille, my Führer."Heydrich nodded, as if he had not already known that information. "It seems that the Waffen-SS has returned to the fold. No doubt Himmler is cursing us at the moment." Taking a nearby pen and a piece of paper, Heydrich began to jot down his instructions to Gille and his new army. "Send this to the new Reichsführer Waffen-SS, along with my congratulations." Heydrich handed the note to Bouhler, watching as he walked out the door."

"My Führer, I must inform you that Paul Hausser has been deposed."\n\nHeydrich nodded. A victory then. To what extent, however, still remained to be seen. "And what of the Kommandostab itself?" Heydrich eyed the new leader of the Deutsch-SS, waiting for him to continue. "Has Stadler been able to take control of the administration? Is he loyal?"\n\nGille nodded. "The Waffen-SS is under Stadler's control." He glanced down at his papers. "Unfortunately, it seems that in seizing control from Hausser, there has been significant personnel damage to many legions, and not all soldiers have sworn their allegiance to you yet, my Führer. Stadler may not be as powerful an ally as we'd hoped."\n\n"Ah." Heydrich was disappointed, something clear on his face. "At the very least, we've rid ourselves of a threat, and gained an ally in the process. Make certain Stadler receives his orders, then. This war is not yet over." Gille nodded, standing to leave."

Heydrich, D'Alquen, and Gille listened closely. "The SS-Legion Langemarck is considered to be highly loyal to the Burgundian state, and seem to be held in a favored position compared to the other collaborator SS legions."\n\nGille frowned. "The Flemish will be hard ones to turn, I think. Erikkson is a nutjob, from what I've heard, and I don't have high hopes for his staff turning on him. Poor commanders tend to raise poor subordinates, and Erikkson is one poor commander. He rules by fear just as much as Himmler does, and he's more savage about it."\n\nD'Alquen piped up. "Himmler keeps them on a short leash, though. Erikkson is a man proud of being Flemish, and I don't think he cares nearly as much for being Burgundian. If we were to promise him an independent, or at least autonomous Flanders, I think he might listen to what we have to say, or at least some of his men will."\n\nThe two went back and forth like this for a few minutes, with Gille eventually slumping defeated. Heydrich supposed that it was at least worth a try to reach out to Erikkson. He surely could not be as thick-headed as Gille seemed to think, and a Flemish nation would be a tempting offer. "It is settled, then. We will reach out to SS-Langemarck."\n\nBouhler wasted no time continuing to his next bit of information. "The SS-Legion Charlemagne. Led by Christian de la Mazière. Made up of French collaborators." Bouhler continued to read off information about the rest of Burgundy's legions, and Gille and D'Alquen continued to spar over whether this was a path worth pursuing."

Had they done it to send a message to Heydrich, or did they truly enjoy it? He could not tell.\n\nThey had found a note with the bodies, something Heydrich uncrumpled to read again. "The proud people of Flanders pledge now and forever their undying loyalty to the Ordensstaat, and to the Reichsführer-SS in whose image it was made. Let the false Führer launch his protests against the true masters of the Aryan race, and the Legion Langemarck will be ready to dethrone him."\n\nWas this the sort of person that Himmler trusted? Heydrich had known Erikkson to be a mad brute, but he figured that he would have known to keep him on a leash. The Führer was no stranger to sending harsh messages, but needless mutilation of Aryan corpses was a step too far, even for him. It was cruel, it was disgusting, and most importantly, it achieved utterly nothing.\n\nHe glared at Bouhler, who was, as always, awaiting Heydrich's orders. "Have their bodies burned.

He could very well imagine it, of course, but he preferred not to.\n\nD'Alquen looked appropriately apologetic. After all, this was his idea. "My Führer, if they have not received our messages it is because they are actively trying to avoid them. Numerous of my diplomats have been turned away at the door, with no reason given. SS-Charlemagne has no desire to talk with us."\n\nA familiar grimace spread across Heydrich's face. Of course, the collaborators had no spine. The Untermenschen with any real sense of national pride had already been shot. "I take it that they mean to aid Himmler, then? The French have joined the parade of madmen aiming to bring the world to ruin?"\n\nD'Alquen shook his head. "My Führer, I do not know what the French plan to do. If they had declared for Himmler, you would be the first to know, but they have remained utterly quiet so far. There is only so much that a diplomat can learn, when he is unwanted and unwelcome."\n\nHeydrich sighed. A failure, of course, but not an unexpected one. "You are dismissed, Herr D'Alquen.

Yes, he could see the logic; regardless of whether they were slaves or not, anyone who wasn't a cripple could hold a gun, and soldiers were what he needed. But still - slaves? How many could even be considered worthy of standing in his presence? Could a single drop of Aryan blood be found in their veins, even if each and every one of them was squeezed dry like an orange? They were almost all Slavs or Jews. The very thought was...\n\nBut the Heukaktion had been authorized, hadn't it? There were Aryans in the east, living among the subhumans. That was unusual. How could that have been the case? Their value had been proven, even if that buffoon Rosenberg hadn't given definitive evidence of-\n\nHeydrich shivered, and moved to stand near the heater.

Repetition worked well for forcing change on one's mental processes. This so-called betrayal of his ideals was not incongruent with the necessities that would make the survival of the Reich possible. He'd set aside morality before - nobody who had been there at Wannsee to help set the Final Solution in motion would argue that it was acceptable by the standards of the population. It had always been about pure necessity; about freeing the Reich's citizens from the burden of doing it themselves in the future when the full evil of international Jewry became too obvious to ignore any longer.\n\nThis was no different. It was merely a sacrifice of conventional morality to assure the continued wellbeing of the Germanic race. If he could extract certain terms from the slaves, they could still be of use while being removed from the equation. Just like the Madagascar Plan. They didn't have to die, just... cease to be a problem for Germany. Simple. There was no contradiction therein.\n\nSo Heydrich told himself, over and over and over again.

"Those 'vermin' were better fighters than your SS holding Prussia. If you won't see the basic decency in this, at least try to see the practical benefit."\n\nThe Führer's pen froze on the paper before him, leaving a steadily spreading inkblot. Still, Heydrich did not raise his eyes. For a long, tense moment, there was silence in the office save for the ticking clock, against which Speidel kept his heartbeat measured. His eyes were drawn to the black Luger, polished and probably loaded, on Heydrich's desk.\n\nFinally, Heydrich resumed writing without a word. There was only a hateful silence, but within it was understanding. Speidel turned on his heel and strode from the office, a single bead of sweat trickling down his forehead, and resolved to keep a tighter leash on his conscience."

 HGR.236.d:0 "Once again, Speidel stood before the Führer's desk, wearing a fresh uniform but still obviously sleep-deprived. That was at least one thing they had in common. Right then, their attitudes couldn't have been further apart.\n\n"They want to talk to me?" Heydrich almost growled the question. "That you'd even permit them to make such a request - what about your bodyguards? Did you think to just end it right there? Shoot the stubborn Pole and liberate us from this sorry affair?"\n\n"I deemed our objective to be more important," lied Speidel smoothly. In truth, he had quite happily sent his guards away and disarmed himself before meeting Piechowski. However, he had decided that informing Heydrich of that would not have been conducive to the alliance.\n\n"Your objective, not ours," snapped Heydrich, showing more intemperance than Speidel had ever known him to possess. "Yours. I wanted no part of this disgrace. Furthermore, you've yet to convince me this is a better use of our time than just sending in the SS to wipe those savages out."\n\nSpeidel leaned on the desk, ignoring Heydrich's slight jump at someone so hostile coming too close for comfort. "Because they're willing to talk at all, Heydrich. That's more than you can say for most of the SS. They know that you're the reason many of them were made slaves in the first place, but they're still open to talk. They don't have any interest beyond survival, which you can offer them. For that, they're willing to walk away from justice."\n\n"Justice, Herr Speidel?"\n\n"Revenge. Whatever you care to call it. Now, it's your choice whether to proceed, but you know where we should stand on this. Swallow your pride and go through with it if you've any decency.""

 HGR.237.t:0 "A Miserable Morning"
 HGR.237.d:0 "It was cold, wet and gray when Heydrich's helicopter landed in a desolate field several kilometers from Königsberg. The only feature besides the forests and the distant city was a recently-built church in the Russian Orthodox style. Heydrich sneered at the sight of it as the Fallschirmjäger piled out of the helicopter and fanned out in a patrol formation around him. No doubt it was some Russian slaves who had put it up. Worse than the Poles, in his estimation, especially in how they clung to their overbearing, backwards form of religion.\n\nAs the group strode across the muddy field towards the church, something glinted in the bell tower, and two of the paratroopers threw themselves in front of Heydrich, rifles up. "Out of the way," he growled, pushing between them. In part, he simply refused to show fear - but it might not be entirely objectionable to be shot rather than go through with this insult to Hitler's memory.\n\nHis escort hurried to catch up as he continued towards the church, churned mud and grass squelching beneath his jackboots. Fitting, he thought, that he should disgrace himself in such a squalid environment, rather than in the sunny fields of fairer climes. Upon reaching the church steps, he paused, still not seeing any other sign of the slaves. Not bothering to wipe his boots, he turned back to the Fallschirmjäger sergeant and tossed him his Luger. "Wait here. If anything happens, burn this shit-heap down."\n\nThrowing the doors open before him, the Führer stalked into the gloom."

 HGR.238.t:0 "In Sight of God and Man"
 HGR.238.d:0 "The floorboards creaked ahead of him in the dark. From behind the crude pulpit emerged the man who could only be Kazimierz Piechowski. Piercing blue eyes, blue as Heydrich's own, peered out at him from above a weathered face framed by a mouse-brown beard. His musculature was lean but prominent, tempered by both a hard slave's diet and years of manual labor.\n\n"Reinhard Heydrich. You are unarmed." He spoke in heavily accented but clearly fluent German.\n\nHeydrich remained impassive. "I don't fear slaves or subhumans. That aside, you aren't either. You wouldn't risk it if your proposal was serious."\n\nPiechowski turned and walked around to behind the altar, motioning for Heydrich to join him. The Führer did so, staring down his supposed inferior across the smooth oak surface with its hand-carved decorations. "Neither of us wants this, Nazi. Your general, Speidel, he is... reasonable, but we could not accept his word alone. Though, he did say you might be willing to accept our terms."\n\n"I promised no such thing to Speidel," Heydrich said. "But I'll hear you regardless. Spare me any appeals, Slav. Just present your terms."\n\nPiechowski glared for a moment before seeming to restrain himself. "First: Guarantee our survival. There are SS to our south planning to invade, and we can't stop them without assistance. Second: let us go. We aren't stupid; I know you won't do what we both know you should. But let my people go, at least. Back to Poland or wherever we choose if it's outside Germany once this is over. That's it."\n\nThere was silence between the pair. It didn't seem unreasonable to Heydrich, but... but, could he really just let this happen? Let the Slav hold the whip over the German, even for the briefest moment?"

 HGR.239.t:0 "One More Thing..."
 HGR.239.d:0 ""I accept."\n\nPiechowski didn't betray any hint of emotion, but Heydrich knew that a sudden turmoil had erupted behind the man's eyes. He felt it too, the metal-on-metal screeching of his ideals clashing with his common sense. "I accept," he repeated. "My forces will ensure that you are not troubled. Furthermore, you have my word, as Führer of the Greater German Reich, that..." God, what was he doing? "That your people will be permitted safe passage upon the defeat of Burgundy."\n\n"Is that so?" Piechowski scratched the stubble on his cheek, glancing sideways at Heydrich as he mulled it over in his head. "Good. Good, but..."\n\n"But what?" Heydrich snapped. Was the subhuman playing games with him now?\n\nThe Pole crossed his arms. "I'm thinking your offer is genuine, Heydrich. But there's more, isn't there? This isn't just a clash of armies. You don't need us for that. This is something bigger. Bigger than you. What's happening out west?"\n\nHeydrich's gut clenched into a knot. Who was this man? He'd found nothing in the archives - was this a pre-war intelligence officer? Had Speidel let him on to what was happening? Regardless, he sensed there was only one thing for it.\n\nHeydrich reached into his pocket, drew forth Himmler's briefing and slapped it down on the altar."
 HGR.239.a:0 "Hope he can read German, too..."

 HGR.240.t:0 "A Stern Talking To"
 HGR.240.d:0 ""See here, slave..." Heydrich began. The Pole was delusional. Do battle with Eichmann? Let the slaves, property of the state, scatter to the wind? No, he could-"\n\n"No." Piechowski immediately stepped back, his expression turned from passive to cold and hostile. "No, I will not negotiate or play games with you. You accept the terms, or you do not."\n\nHeydrich tensed, fingers gripping his side of the altar tight. "Your terms are not acceptable. Allow me to-"\n\n"I said no!" barked Piechowski suddenly, his voice loud and clear in the freezing air. "I invited you here in good faith, but even that was not enough for you." He stepped away from the altar, gazing out across the empty, rough-hewn pews for a moment. Turning back to face Heydrich, his face was filled with anger. For a moment, the Führer thought the slave might rush him.\n\n"You come to slaves - slaves! - begging for aid, Nazi! You think I can't see how desperate you are? You need us, but you try to bargain anyway! It's fucking pathetic. If annihilation's not enough for you to put your putrid fucking ideology aside, I've got nothing more to say to you. Come and take us if you want your damned country back, but every one of us will die before kneeling to you again."\n\nWith that, Piechowski strode out a side door, and Heydrich was left alone in the cold, damp air, with only the smell of mould and a profound sense of failure for company."
 HGR.240.a:0 "Stubborn animal."

 HGR.241.t:0 "For All Europe"
 HGR.241.d:0 ""Astounding," murmured Piechowski, as he finished reading and downed the papers. "Incredible. This is true?"\n\nHeydrich nodded curtly. "Yes, and you know I'm being honest. I wouldn't come to you for help otherwise, would I?"\n\n"No, I suppose you wouldn't," Piechowski said, stepping back to lean against the wall. He looked deep in thought for a moment. Heydrich had felt the same - totally overwhelmed, even if the cause for that feeling was quite different. Finally, the slave leader spoke again. "All right, Heydrich. By my estimation, this is worthwhile. If... if you can really guarantee our freedom and keep the SS away from us, then I will not decline."\n\n"You already have my word," replied Heydrich. "That is the best I can do, though it shall be followed with action. I will... permit the fulfilment of our agreement when the time comes."\n\nPiechowski smirked. "Permit it? Very generous of you, Herr Heydrich. Well then, we have an alliance. May God forgive us both, I suppose.""
 HGR.241.a:0 "We all have to dance to His tune."
 
 HGR.242.t:0 "In the Face of Armageddon"
 HGR.242.d:0 "Piechowski read through the briefing in silence, not once glancing up at Heydrich. His face remained stony the whole way through, unreadable as Heydrich at his best. If he believed what he was reading, there was no indication of it.\n\nAfter ten long minutes, during which the Pole scrutinized every page like a hawk, the briefing was finally set down, and Piechowski delivered his answer: "No."\n\n"Elaborate," said Heydrich, not batting an eye. "What do you mean?"\n\n"I mean no, Herr Heydrich. I see the facts, but they will not suffice for this. Now go. We will not oppose you if you leave us be, but will fight you if we must. There's nothing more to say." Then he was gone - vanished out a side door into the rain and fog of that cold Prussian morning. With him went Heydrich's curses, and - curiously - a little bit of his hope."
 HGR.242.a:0 "Perhaps even they possess principles."

 HGR.243.t:0 "A Red Spark"
 HGR.243.d:0 ""Our gamble has paid off." A smirk spread across the imperious face of Gunter d'Alquen. "The Speerite rebels have risen up in SS Lotharingia. I hear it's a fucking bloodbath."\n\n"And what of Eicke?" Heydrich laced his fingers together with immense satisfaction. The powder keg under Theodor Eicke's shiny boots had just needed a little spark, and Heydrich had been more than willing to light it. Weapons and supplies were anonymously smuggled to the degenerate underground resistance, providing them with the opportunity to launch a coup against their brutish overlords.\n\n"Some reports claim he was paraded before the crowd and given a mock trial. Others say he was shoved against the wall with his inner circle and gunned down. Either way, Eicke and his cabinet are hanging by their feet on a makeshift gallows."\n\n"That's not how Speer's vermin treated our men during the Bürgerkrieg," Heydrich replied with an almost imperceptible frown.\n\n"These aren't just fascist bureaucrats and old Prussian veterans, my Führer. Students are leading the uprising. Not just the liberals, but the true radicals. Bolsheviks! Some bitch named 'Ulrike Meinhof' has taken control."\n\nHeydrich kept his surprise behind a glassy exterior. The Speerites were allowing student thugs to seize the reins of power? Was there no one else to rally behind? He ordered d'Alquen to leave and lit up a cigarette. As Adolf Hitler's core tenets were being desecrated by the likes of Martin Bormann and Albert Speer, the old and senile Führer could only watch in anguish. Now, while Speer hid in the underbelly of some disgusting American city, his spineless fascist admirers were marching through the streets of Germany, side-by-side with Bolshevik radicals. Heydrich took a drag of his cigarette, and tasted the bitter sweetness of irony."

 HGR.244.d:0 "There was something tragically beautiful in watching an ancient and powerful structure crumble to the ground. The labor of a thousand generations of men turned to dust in an instant. That was what Hitler had felt, when he watched the Second Reich break, shattering in the wake of the First World War. And then, upon the foundations that remained, he had built something new, something great.\n\nAs Heydrich watched Wewelsburg crumble, fiery spurts bursting through the castle's walls, he wondered what great thing he would build upon its ashes.\n\nBouhler had been reluctant to give the order, a rare bit of defiance from the man, but he had come around with a bit of prodding. Though he had not been happy about it. Heydrich had grown tired of his sulking. As such, he was not in his usual place in Heydrich's office as the Führer watched the castle's destruction on a small gray screen. D'Alquen instead attended the Führer.\n\nThe power to enact change, to tear down the structures of the past to create a new world order. That was the power that Heydrich now possessed, and that realization brought a smile to his face. The conflict with Himmler had distracted him from the truth he had yet to realize: Reinhard Heydrich was the Führer.\n\nAnd yet, a nagging voice in the back of his mind reminded him that everything he had done was to prevent the world from tearing itself down. Heydrich suppressed that voice, pushed it out of his head, down his throat, and deep into the caverns of his consciousness. Deciding to focus on other matters, Heydrich held out his hand, and D'Alquen pressed a phone into it. Heydrich brought it to his ear. "Good morning, Herr Klingenburg.""

Heydrich, for his part, did his best to not show the strain of the past months on his face as he watched Skorzeny, his eyes tracing the distinctive scar that lacerated his cheek. His mask nearly broke when Skorzeny began, catching him off guard in its suddenness.\n\n"There's a reason you're coming to me, and it's not just for a friendly chat, I take it." Skorzeny remarked, Heydrich snapping back into attention.\n\n"No. I need you for a reason, Skorzeny. I need your expertise, your experience, your... knowledge of Himmler's plans." The commando took that in for a moment, idly puffing on his cigarette. Heydrich almost thought he was taking his time on purpose, as some sort of power play- two could play at that, of course, and Heydrich was no slouch when it came to negotiation himself.\n\n"It's a hell of a risk for me, you know, sticking my neck out so far for you. Does that folder next to you have anything to do with this?"\n\nHeydrich wordlessly passed it over, watching as Skorzeny flipped it open. His eyes narrowed as he read on, silently skimming through for a minute before passing it back.\n\n"I take it this isn't everything you know, is it?" Skorzeny questioned.\n\n"The rest will be made obtainable if you cooperate."\n\nHe thought a moment more, glanced back to the folder, and nodded."

They were not prepared for any sort of pitched, all out battle while completing this mission.\n\nReichsführer Gille had ordered them to find a path through to Burgundy, and to take careful note of the fortifications, patrols, or projects they saw along the way. Whether Mohnke could be turned to the Führer's side or not, they needed to know the situation along the border before making any moves.\n\nThe woods were almost eerily quiet, as the flat ground they were standing on gradually sloped into a hill. At the bottom, a barracks of some kind. Trying to get a closer look, the soldiers unknowingly stepped a bit too far into the open. A head perked up, somewhere in the shadows below.\n\nWithout a word, the scouts were greeted with a hail of lead."

"If you let Heydrich, your Führer, march his men through your outposts, you will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams. Defy him, and the punishments will be more than severe."\n\nWilhelm Mohnke seemed neither tempted by the promises, nor unnerved by the threats. He glared at Adolf, his eyes filled with disdain. "But what of the promises your Führer made to mine? Should I forget those? Should I count Heydrich the traitor a trustworthy man once more?" He was so full of hate and bile that, in that moment, Adolf almost expected to be spat upon.\n\nAdolf blinked trying not to let Mohnke get to him. "You could return to Germania, the coup behind you and a forgotten affair. Do you not wish to end your exile?" Adolf offered, half trying to be persuasive and half truly wondering. Mohnke seemed to take offense. With one final look of contempt, he tapped his hand against the table thrice.\n\nIn an instant, the air around Adolf ripped apart, and a hot, sticky red splashed against his face. Mohnke's men. In a wordless panic, Adolf pawed at his chest, trying to find if he had been shot. He had heard the pain could be too great to feel. He found nothing, though Mohnke's soldiers seemed to find it funny as they stepped past him to remove the body's of Adolf's guards.\n\nMohnke, who had not stood once during the whole ordeal, stared ahead with the same cold, dead anger as he possessed when he had ordered Adolf's guards shot. He was mad. Utterly insane. "Tell your Butcher he'll find no blubber on me, boy." A hand closed around Adolf's shoulder, and he was roughly removed from the room."

A great cheer rose up when Heydrich pronounced his sentence: death, to be carried out immediately.\n\n"The least he deserves," came a voice from Schiller's left. Glancing in that direction, he saw a skeletal, ragged man with a thick, frayed beard, clad in the striped pyjamas of a concentration camp inmate. Ragged stitching on his breast showed where a badge had been torn off. What he'd been in for, Schiller couldn't tell. "Watch him, goy. Watch him hang. Learn from it, and maybe it won't be too late for you, as well."\n\nSchiller spun around, but the Jew was gone. He thought for a moment to shout, but then the crowd roared once more.

However, there was little he could do about it now, except trying to discern words from the grainy noise that was coming over the tube.\n\n"Generaloberst? Do you hear me?" Heydrich bit his lip, it was the third time he was shouting the question. With only static coming out of the phone, he grew increasingly enraged. "Halder! I cannot understand what you are saying, would you please speak louder." It was a few moments until the weak voice of the old soldier started to be heard.\n\n"Herr Heydrich, I can understand you with some difficulty." The Führer scoffed at the calculated insolence that was the non mention of his official title. "Herr Heydrich, I have been awaiting news from the Heimat for some time. What is going on?"\n\n"There are some difficulties Halder... regarding the Reichsführer's vision for Germany. It is imperative that your men return to Germany immediately in order to save the Reich." Heydrich hoped the Wehrmacht's dislike of Himmer would sway Halder to join him.\n\n"I'm sorry Herr Heydrich, come again? It did not go through." Slightly unhinged, Heydrich repeated his plea for help, understanding that tolerating what was obviously another insult was necessary to fulfill his task. "That is all well and good, Herr Heydrich. However, my men cannot swim to Hamburg. Without cooperation from the Luftwaffe or the Kriegsmarine, I'm afraid my troops are stuck. Not to mention whether the English will permit this. Oh, and incidentally, one more thing. I believe my continued service to the Reich merits a long overdue promotion."\n\n"Do not worry about that... Generalfeldmarschall.

All around him, he saw the smoldering ruins of buildings, squads of SS and Wehrmacht men running around like headless chickens. Whatever Heydrich's rule did to his fatherland, it wasn't any good.\n\n"Generalfeldmarschall. Heil Heydrich!" The shout from across the aircraft's exit ladder emanated from a pair of SS officers, their arms straightened out. While he never liked the SS, Halder was sure happy to hear his new rank being spoken out loud. The English refused to believe that Heydrich had promoted him over the phone.\n\n"Sieg Heil." Halder performed a lazy roman salute before walking down the ladder.

It was clear to him that Heydrich did not rule Germany - it was also clear that Himmler did not rule, though this was somewhat more exclusive knowledge. This is good, of course, because, come darkness or light, Belarus is the domain of Vituska. He is as eternal as the dirt, the stones, the hills and the trees. How fortunate it is for Vituska that the Reich is divided into squabbling, for he had no such weaknesses.\n\nGuns were being smuggled from anybody willing to sell them. Criminal organizations were bribed within and without the borders of Vituska's domain. A few individuals who posed a threat were neutralized in various ways, their bodies sent to make a message. Industrial magnates were educated on how the lion's share of their production belonged to Vituska. Militias were armed, and existing militias were brought over to his side.

Regardless, Heydrich needed Vituska, and, like anything else the Nazis needed, he would get it through brute force. Thus, it came as no surprise when Vituska came face to face with several armed SS soldiers.\n\n"It is in your best interest, the best interest of Belarus, and the best interest of all Europe to ally with us." Blunt, and to the point. The Nazis were consistent if anything.\n\n"Please explain how it is in my best interest to ally with Reinhard Heydrich." Vituska knew that brute force was the Nazi's tool in this little game. He also knew that the soldiers would not want to physically attack him, figuring that there were a thousand hidden bodyguards ready to gun them down at the slightest flinch. They were correct, of course. This made it quite safe for him to dismiss the intended threat, and go to the matter of debate.\n\n"It is Heydrich or Himmler. We are quite sure that you understand which is better for you." The SS soldiers were just as aware of the unviability of physical force. It was never going to work, but it was better to try.\n\n"I am well aware of who is better for Belarus. It is me. You can take these words to Heydrich."

The soldier's face betrayed no emotion, showed no news of whether this was good or bad news - the way of a Spartan.\n\n"Go on."

However, recognizing a common enemy in Himmler, he has decided to spare some aid for the coalition, to help us in this struggle." This was good news, and a smile almost appeared on Heydrich's face. A common enemy, indeed. Vituska detested Heydrich, and always will, but even the self-made king in Belarus would know he would have nothing if Himmler had his way.

First, his morning coffee would be poisoned. Should he survive that, his car would be bombed by a mine already laid on the road. Should he survive that, there was a gunman placed at both his panic shelter, and the next stop on his route. Finally, after hours of nerve-wracking waiting, a soldier came in with news.\n\n"Report." Heydrich said matter-of-factly.\n\n"The coffee poisoning was a failure, and the poisoner has not been heard from since." Not a good start. "The other three were irrelevant. The schedule was a lie. Vituska went in the exact opposite direction of what the leaks suggested. Both gunmen were found with their throats slit. The bomber is the sole survivor."\n\nHeydrich looked down at his desk. Outmaneuvered by a Slav. Somebody would have to die for this - somebody who hasn't already. He dismissed the reporter, then sat back in the chair. Ostland would not fall under Heydrich's control.

Hell, if he had it his way, he would have ground their skulls into the dust long ago.\n\nEven with his personal distaste for Untermensch, he had to admit a few things about the change had surprised them with how... useful they were. Chief among these surprises was the issue of repatriation of slaves- or, as Heydrich liked to put it, deportation of Slavs and other undesirables back to their country. It startled him how simple the solution was, and how it worked out for everyone involved- the Slavs were placated with the return of their family and friends, and with every Slav that crossed the border east, the Aryan paradise in Germany that Heydrich envisioned grew closer and closer to reality. After all, Germany was for Germans, was it not?\n\nIt may not have been the solution that he truly wanted- deporting the Slavs was simply kicking the issue of racial impurity down the road- but he had to admit it was a quick fix. Perhaps these Poles could be of some use, after all."

Before him, illuminated by a desk lamp, sat yet another stack of dusty comminiques and letters, plucked from deep in the Reich's archives. Himmler's name adorned each and every one, messages from years past, mostly detailing the most mundane operations of life. Heydrich let out a sigh as he pressed onwards, shuffling through the stack, suddenly pausing as he read the title of one particularly yellowed note, dating back to 1943.\n\n"Escape Plan", it read, and Heydrich realized he had struck gold. He skimmed through it, and his greatest hopes were confirmed- at some point in 1943, at the height of the war, Himmler had made a contingency plan to surrender to the Allies had things gone south. A written manifesto of treason. Heydrich set the paper down gingerly, as if scared it would disintegrate if moved too quickly. He let out a breath he barely even realized he was holding- it wouldn't be as late of a night as he feared."

 HGR.1000.desc:0 "The bar, while old, was still usually packed, though there were fewer here today than usual. Fine by Felix, they were supposed to meet with their contact in the city, and the bars in Gehlen's breakaway state were as good a cover as any. Not that Konrad's discomfort was making it any easier. "For God's sake, act like you belong here."\n\n"We're not supposed to hang around in bars. It's a disgrace," Konrad bemoaned.\n\n"We're not supposed to look like we're not supposed to. Remember the mission."\n\n"Eh, fine with me," Gottlieb shrugged as he lit up a cigarette.\n\n"You're even worse than him."\n\n"What? Rumor is the Führer-"\n\n"Say another treasonous word and Gehlen's men will be the least of your worries." Where was the contact, though? A group of partygoers ordered beers and sat directly across from them on the other side of the bar, each occasionally looking at them. Had something gone wrong? That bulge in the man's coat, was that a pistol? "I don't think our contact's coming..." Felix whispered. He made eye contact with the lead partygoer. It felt like an eternity.\n\nThen he drew his pistol. He fired three times, shattering a beer stein and knocking the man back. The others drew their pistols all at the same time as the civilians screamed and fled. The exchange was brief but messy, Felix fired almost randomly amid the breaking glass and screams. Ten seconds later, it was over. He was out of bullets, and smoke filled the air. He checked the other side after reloading. Four bodies, each armed with a pistol. "Looks like Gehlen -"he turned and saw Konrad dead on the ground. "For fuck's sake!" he shouted. "Gottlieb, out the back," he said as he shot the cowering bartender in the head. As they ran outside and down an alleyway, he groaned. "Well shit."\n\n"What, Felix?"\n\n"Not only is our contact probably dead...""

 HGR.1001.desc:0 "The aide passed a folder of profiles with multiple photos to Konrad Henlein, who reviewed each in turn. "Hmm. This one is suitable," he said, setting the first to the right. "This one, this one, this one, all good. Now this one," he said, holding up one profile, "She is unsuitable for breeding. Purge her as soon as possible."\n\n"She looks like a perfect specimen of Aryan beauty, Herr Henlein."\n\n"Pah! Idiot. You don't have the skill for this. Look: her nose is excessively large, her posture too squat. She is certainly a Jewess, and probably a Czech as well. Weed her out." As the aide left and Henlein continued reviewing profiles, his phone rang. "Reichsstatthalter Henlein speaking."\n\n"Herr Henlein," a voice spoke at the other end. "Reichsführer Himmler wished to convey his appreciation for your work. He commends your appreciation for the severity of the situation the Aryan race currently faces, and your understanding of the necessities of reactivating certain measures that subversives left unattended. The Reichsführer also wishes to let you know that, if you are successful, there may be a promotion in store for you. \n\nHenlein stammered. "I will be sure to keep his appreciation in mind! I am honored that he would recognize my work."\n\n"As you should. Heil Himmler!" The phone hung up, and Henlein was overjoyed. His work had been noticed, at last he would be known as one of the saviors of Aryanism! He flipped to one particular profile. A suitable age, a suitable face, such lovely, beautiful, Aryan features... Would that he could help save the Aryan race personally, but alas, he could not. Some strapping young officer would have to take up that duty instead.""

 HGR.1002.t:0 "Older Times"
 HGR.1002.desc:0 "Peiper examined the map again sipping from his cup of coffee. How to do this? There was a pass there that needed to be guarded to keep the border secure, but how best to guard it? He pondered the question as he allowed himself to look through the windows of the Eagle's Nest at the Alps beyond. It was, he had to admit, a beautiful sight. No wonder Hitler had chosen this as his retreat. Simpler times, when they knew what they were fighting for: the German race, the National Socialist vision.\n\nNow Peiper read reports of Germans fighting Germans, SS fighting SS. What the hell had the Reich become? No, no. No time to think such thoughts. Duty called, duty to the Reich, the race. But who was his race's leader? Heydrich, or Himmler? And what the hell was Himmler planning? He heard rumors, but shook them off. Better to concentrate on duty.\n\nHe heard Sigurd enter the room. "I just spoke with Lina on the phone," she said.\n\n"Lina?" He turned to face his wife. "Ah! How is she doing? It's been so long."\n\n"She is doing as well as can be, I suppose. She and Reinhard are alive and well."\n\nPeiper stood up and paced the room. "Reinhard... Oh, Reinhard, whatever shall be done with you, my friend?" He faced his wife again, and embraced her. "Do you remember those times, Sigurd?"\n\nShe chuckled. "Yes, I do. Maybe we can see them soon again?" Peiper could only look into his wife's eyes, remembering old friends, old wars, and old times."

 HGR.1003.t:0 "Darkness Falls"
 HGR.1003.desc:0 "Not even the radios were working. The phones, the radios, nothing. The entire Kampfgruppe was in the dark, and Peiper was stuck here, in the Eagle's Nest, with a revolving series of couriers.\n\n"Take these," he told the first man, "And bring them to Bergmann's battalion. Quickly! You, take these," he handed a stack of notes to the second man. "Ensure that the border posts receive these as soon as possible. And make sure to ask them if they've been having issues with their own radios.\n\nPeiper cursed under his breath. At first he'd been confused when everything shut down, then he took one look at a map. Heydrich's base was closer to the Eagle's Nest than Ost-Paris, and as such couriers were a lot easier to send from Germania than Burgundy. In between the waves of couriers running to and from the Eagle's Nest, he looked at his aide-de-camp. "Still nothing from Ost-Paris?"\n\n"No, sir."\n\nAt that exact moment, two of his guards appeared with another SS officer, who saluted. "Brigadeführer Peiper, this man came here claiming he has a message for you from Germania," the first guard announced. Peiper approached the ostensible emissary, who saluted and handed him an envelope. He recognized the handwriting immediately. Reinhard, you incorrigible man. Peiper couldn't help but smile.\n\nHe turned back to the emissary as he opened the envelope. "Tell the Führer that if he wants to speak to me he doesn't need to go to all this trouble." Despite the smile, Peiper felt somewhat anxious. Friend or not, he knew Heydrich was sending him an ultimatum this way. There was nowhere to run if things went poorly."

 HGR.1004.desc:0 ""And in conclusion, Generalleutnant, at our current rate of fuel loss, we will be unable to continue flying any sorties at all within three months. If we limit our sorties, we can still retain acceptable levels of reconnaissance and extend our fuel limit to seven to nine months. Depending on extenuating circumstances."\n\nSteinhoff nodded and continued to look at the map as the report was delivered. Their reconnaissance was, fortunately, quite good, though it would grow worse over time. "Herr Oberst, how about ammunition? Bombs and rockets in particular."\n\nOberst Gerhard Limberg looked over the papers. "Around the same amount, sir."\n\n"Hmm. The infantry divisions and Fallschrimäger detachments report Burgundian divisions closing around the borders. There have only been minor firefights, but the way things have been going, that won't last long."\n\n"Why haven't they poured into the base yet?"\n\n"Because we can blast them off the face of the earth with our jets and helicopters. But the fuel is running out, as you've so eloquently stated, and any engagements are going to accelerate that. Your fuel timer is how long we have. Once we can't bomb those fanatics back into Hell, we're dead men. Unless you've been practicing your marksmanship and hiding an entire army group from me."\n\n"Would that I were, sir."\n\nSteinhoff rubbed his scarred temples. Himmler was going to come for them soon. And once they were out of fuel, there was nothing they could do. But there was someone fighting Himmler. Steinhoff detested the Blonde Beast, but these are strange times. He had little choice. He just wondered if Heydrich would reach out to him, before Himmler did in quite a different way."

 HGR.1005.desc:0 "The Adler was Dönitz's pride and joy. His last, perhaps. She had been the last great ship commissioned by the Führer, and he remembered the day she had been launched. Watching those four political animals, already plotting to rip Germany to shreds. He should have thrown them overboard then and there. Spared the Reich this catastrophe. The crisis that his men were now discussing with him in his command room.\n\n"Herr Großadmiral, the food shortages have only grown more critical. Granaries are estimated to be empty within the next four months, and we have already begun to implement starvation diets for most of the civilians. The hospitals have also begun to run low on medicine, and combined with the food shortages, it's likely disease will begin to run rampant soon," the civilian representative explained. "Herr Dönitz, we need an alternative solution. This is unsustainable."\n\nOne of the Kriegsmarine captains spoke up. "The good news is that Scotland has graciously allowed some refugees to be transferred to their ports, as have Norway and Sweden. But it will still not be enough before the situation can be stabilized. We need a more consistent flow of food."\n\n"Hmm. Has anyone else agreed to provide temporary supplies?" Dönitz asked. The Council either looked to one another or down at their papers. "That answers that. Well then -"\n\n"Herr Großadmiral," one of the captains said. "There is one possibility. It's... Well, sir, Heydrich." A pause, during which the captain collected himself. "Sir, aid shipments can't feed Hamburg. We need supplies from the rest of the Reich. And since Himmler likely won't help us at all and Heydrich needs all the support he can get, we can negotiate -"\n\n"Negotiate with him?" Dönitz fumed. "That monster? That treacherous butcher? He's the man who destroyed the Reich! No, that brat can go to hell. Him and his puppetmaster."\n\nThe rest of the council looked uncomfortably. "Sir, we might not have a choice. Heydrich can feed the people better than we can. No one wants to accept his help, but we don't have a choice." Dönitz leaned back, watching as the Council nodded in agreement. He waved his hand, conceding defeat."
