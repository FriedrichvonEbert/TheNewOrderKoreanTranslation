 POLITICS_REINHARD_HEYDRICH_DESC:0 "하이드리히에게는 많은 이름이 있습니다. 금발의 짐승. 프라하의 도살자. 젊고 사악한 죽음의 신. 세계 대전 중 암살 시도에서 간신히 살아남은 후, 하이드리히는 그의 부하들이 옛 체코슬로바키아에서 수천 명을 사냥하고 소탕하는 것을 개인적으로 도왔습니다. 그가 뿌린 폐허와 파괴 위에 의기양양하게 서 있는 사진들은 전쟁 내내 독일의 선전용으로 사용되었고, 심지어 괴벨스는(다소 겸손한 어조로) 이에 대한 영화까지 촬영했습니다.\n\n하지만 지금, 하이드리히는 더욱 불길한 일들을 하고 있습니다. 인형사의 인형사로써, 어두운 줄 위에서 그는 부르군트 SS국의 국가지도자 하인리히 힘러의 명령에 따라 이리저리 뛰어다닙니다.\n\n부르군디의 충실하고 공포스러운 하인이지만, 많은 이들은 그의 주인의 사실상 무시하는 태도를 주목합니다. 하이드리히는 그의 뒤를 조용히 따를뿐이며, 이는 그에게 아첨꾼과 회사원이라는 별명을 주었습니다. 물론 그걸 그 앞에서 말할 수 있는 사람은 없을 겁니다."
 POLITICS_HEYDRICH_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "Reinhard Heydrich is dead, struck down by a mysterious assassin during the valiant struggle for Germany. With the Reichsführer der Deutschen SS now dead, throwing the entire SS gamble into jeopardy, Burgundy's interest in supporting Heydrich's forces has seemingly died with him. As the chain of command begins to break down, with Gruppenführers launching power plays and desperate last stands, all centralized authority inside the German SS has collapsed."

 ### Focus Tree ### 
 HGR_burgerkreig:0 "Der Bürgerkrieg"
 HGR_burgerkreig_desc:0 "We saw this in our dreams, long ago: the end of the Reich. An apocalyptic storm of fire and blood, scourging the forests and mountains of our home. In its path stands a single man: Reinhard Heydrich, true heir of Hitler and former Reichsführer-SS of Germany. For the sake of the pure race, for the future of the Reich, for glorious salvation - he must win. Heil Heydrich."
 HGR_burgundische_SS:0 "Burgundische-SS"
 HGR_burgundische_SS_desc:0 "The Burgundian SS are the most loyal and true servants of our cause. They alone possess the tripartite qualities of obedience to the Führer, freedom from temptation and absolute purity of blood. Their counterparts in Germany proper are loyal, but have been unduly influenced by feeble Hitlerism, while the Waffen-SS are little more than glorified mercenaries. Only the purest of the pure race are capable of securing victory."
 HGR_a_helping_hand:0 "A Helping Hand"
 HGR_a_helping_hand_desc:0 "In his greatness, Reichsführer Himmler has vowed to shore up our efforts with all the resources at his disposal. Guns, supplies, armor, aircraft, trucks; all that we need and more besides. More importantly, our Aryan brothers have begun to cross the border in a steady stream - one that shall soon become a ceaseless river. The hills of Alsace-Lorraine will echo once more with the march of jackboots."
 HGR_advisor_staff:0 "Advisor Staff"
 HGR_advisor_staff_desc:0 "As Reichsführer Himmler has correctly assessed, the officers at our disposal are not... adequate for our purposes. There are too many factors that make them inherently unreliable: familial ties, material possessions, self-aggrandizement. Officers sourced directly from Ost-Paris, the heart of Burgundy itself, are the cream of the crop, and Himmler has generously agreed to send a number of them to aid us. They will serve in direct advisory roles, as well as keep an eye on the lesser men of the Deutsch-SS."
 HGR_combined_formations:0 "Combined Formations"
 HGR_combined_formations_desc:0 "Ever since its formation, the SS has dominated the battlefields of Europe and beyond. This is due largely to the manner in which their oaths of loyalty tend to override all obstacles: fear, doubt, and so on. The oath serves as a unifying force, creating a comradeship amongst Aryans that transcends mere technicalities. As divisions between Burgundian and German SS units break down, the two shall be intermingled, combining the original German spirit with new Burgundian ideals. The result shall be the purest, most ferocious warriors the Reich has ever seen!"
 HGR_burgundian_leaders:0 "Burgundian Leaders"
 HGR_burgundian_leaders_desc:0 "Now that Burgundian ideals have proliferated amongst our non-Burgundian units, perhaps they will be more amenable to a change in leadership. Our soldiers have primarily been commanded by officers of the Deutsch-SS, but these men do not understand the modern Aryan way of war as Reichsführer Himmler does. His hand-picked officers are already en route to Germany; they will be most welcome in our chain of command."
 HGR_burgundian_knowledge:0 "Burgundian Knowledge"
 HGR_burgundian_knowledge_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, and Reichsführer Himmler possesses both in astounding quantities. The Führer's old friend has assured him that he will have any intelligence whatsoever he desires, so long as it pertains to furthering the goals of true National Socialism. With the long-buried secrets of our rivals in our possession, we will hold a considerable edge over the traitors. They cannot hope to pierce the veil so long as Herr Himmler is with us."
 HGR_arms_drives:0 "Arms Drives"
 HGR_arms_drives_desc:0 "While our spirit is naturally sufficient to overcome any obstacle that might bar our path, even the mightiest Aryan warrior cannot wage war without his tools of death. Unfortunately, we lack the industrial base to avoid that situation with certainty. Reichsführer Himmler has acknowledged this fact, and promises us a plentiful supply of arms and ammunition. From whence this bounty comes, we do not know, but guns are guns no matter the maker... though Aryan guns might be preferable, of course."
 HGR_arms_pipeline:0 "Arms Pipeline"
 HGR_arms_pipeline_desc:0 "Fortuitous news on this fine day: Reichsführer Himmler has seen fit to greatly increase the size and frequency of Burgundy's weapons shipments, turning the system of regular deliveries into a steady flow. It is a true mark of Aryan solidarity that he knows so well the needs of his Führer. With so many quality arms available, we shall easily match the industrial output of our foes."
 HGR_hiyo_brittany:0 "Hiyo Brittany"
 HGR_hiyo_brittany_desc:0 "The Bretons might qualify as Aryan physically, but in spirit they are more akin to Jews. All they care for is wealth, and it is no secret that our enemies are likely buying Breton arms. Still, they possess a large and open arms industry. They will quite happily sell to us, and could procure some more exotic equipment that we cannot produce ourselves. Dealing with these greedy pigs disgusts the Führer, but he will not turn away aid when the future of the Reich is at stake. We can easily take back our money once the current war is won."
 HGR_anti_partisanship:0 "Anti-Partisanship"
 HGR_anti_partisanship_desc:0 "Though this be a civil war, it is no different from that which we fought twenty years ago. Then as now, we will assuredly be plagued by partisans and guerilla fighters. Once upon a time, the duty of anti-partisan operations would have fallen to the Einsatzgruppen alone, but their numbers are insufficient. Thus, to assist them, the SD shall be armed and trained for the purpose. They already have extensive practice in dealing with civilian and military dissidents; partisans are no different, save for the fact that they usually shoot back at their oppressors..."
 HGR_for_the_true_fuhrer:0 "For The True Führer"
 HGR_for_the_true_fuhrer_desc:0 "Certain men - such as those degenerates on the other side of the battlefield - think the Führer a puppet. They deride him for accepting assistance from the Ordenstaat, citing it as proof of his treason and iniquity. Those scum will receive their just desserts in due course, but their slander echoes worryingly amongst the populace. To reassure the good people of Germany that he is his own man, the Führer has decreed that we are to take 'special care' in the attribution of our successes. They come from him, his loyal soldiers, and nowhere else."
 HGR_rally_on_heydrich:0 "Rally On Heydrich"
 HGR_rally_on_heydrich_desc:0 "The common people of the Reich have so far been a disappointment to the Führer. They fear our soldiers, resent us for our rightful appropriation of their wealth and are barely trustworthy themselves. This will not do; if Heydrich is to rule, he must be empowered with the channelled energies of the Aryan race. To spread the Führer's pure ideals and save the people from themselves, we should begin drafting them as conscripts and encouraging them to work harder. Once they have been reminded of the Aryan way, they will surely embrace our Führer wholeheartedly."
 HGR_only_for_germany:0 "Only For Germany"
 HGR_only_for_germany_desc:0 "It seems that hostile propaganda is not so easily counteracted. Unsurprising, given the righteously prideful nature of the Aryan mind. Still, we cannot allow misunderstandings about the Führer's purpose to propagate any further. He is loyal first and foremost to National Socialism, the Greater German Reich and the Aryan race - nothing more. The same is true of the SS. Even if they are Burgundian, their Reichsführer is just as dedicated to our ideals as Heydrich himself is. Opinions to the contrary will be met appropriately."
 HGR_deutsch_SS:0 "Deutsch-SS"
 HGR_deutsch_SS_desc:0 "The Burgundians are noble allies, exemplars of all that is good and true in the Aryan race. The Waffen-SS are legions without number, disciplined and professional. But neither can win this war for us. This is a German war, fought on German soil. Only the blood of true-born Germans, raised in the heimat, can redeem the Fatherland. This will not be an easy path to walk, but walk it we must."
 HGR_lesser_allies:0 "Lesser Allies"
 HGR_lesser_allies_desc:0 "Most German citizens do not have a positive image of Reichsführer Himmler, despite his good intentions. Unfortunate, but that needn't be a hindrance to us. By sacrificing some of Himmler's goodwill towards us, we have made the Führer more appealing to Germans who are not of the SS. A surprising number of volunteers have come forward to take up arms in his name. No brave soldier shall be turned away in Germany's hour of need; follow us, bold Aryans!"
 HGR_purity:0 "Purity"
 HGR_purity_desc:0 "The association of our Führer with 'treachery' and 'Himmlerite scheming' is patently unfair. Reinhard Heydrich was a dear friend and confidant of the great Adolf Hitler; why would he ever betray Germany? If you would speak of treason, look no further than those self-proclaimed 'Führers' we face! An effeminate liberal, a brown-nosing bureaucrat and a decadent warmonger - are these the true faces of National Socialism? Are they the ones you would throw your weight behind? No! Heydrich, our rightful Führer, is the embodiment of Aryan virtue and the National Socialist ethos. Heed not the words of traitors - believe in Heydrich!"
 HGR_define_german:0 "Define 'German'"
 HGR_define_german_desc:0 "Science makes new discoveries all the time. That fact remains true for racial science. Once, not so long ago, it was said that only Prussians were truly German. Now, as before, our knowledge has expanded. There are more Germans than we previously thought in Europe, even if they have the misfortune of being born in lesser nations such as France or Bohemia. If there are any such individuals within our lands, they must naturally be granted the status of true Germans - and, as is their right, brought into the Deutsche-SS. Aryans of all nations, unite!"
 HGR_volunteer_divisions:0 "Volunteer Divisions"
 HGR_volunteer_divisions_desc:0 "As our Führer's image has become more definitively 'German', more and more of the people are forming up beneath his standard. They long for a Germany that is, above all, strong and secure. As a result, we now have enough manpower to field entire divisions' worth of militia. Though not comparable in quality to the SS or even the Heer, Heydrich's leadership will multiply their strength tenfold."
 HGR_fight_for_whats_right:0 "Fight For What's Right"
 HGR_fight_for_whats_right_desc:0 "Can you not see, fellow Aryans? Do our deeds not satisfy you? The SS is not your enemy! We have always been the stalwart defenders of National Socialism. When conflict exists between us, it is only because some deviant or Jewish puppet wishes it! Is it they who are traitors and renegades, not us. If you would save the Fatherland, if you are a pure-blooded Aryan, then join us! Rebel against your dark masters, or all of you will perish!"
 HGR_for_a_stronger_germany:0 "For A Stronger Germany"
 HGR_for_a_stronger_germany_desc:0 "The factories are not nearly as productive as they should be. Our workers have been far too lax of late. They must be reminded what it is we are fighting for, and the importance of their role in the salvation of the Aryan race. Their artisanship is just as vital to Germany's cause as the soldier's bravery or the pilot's daring. What that means, in simple terms, is: work harder! Harder and faster, not better! You're not Speerites, are you?"
 HGR_for_a_pure_germany:0 "For A Purer Germany"
 HGR_for_a_pure_germany_desc:0 "Armed struggle is our primary concern at this time, but we must not neglect our duty as National Socialists. There are far too many undesirables in Germany, especially within our own holdings. Fifth columnists, clergymen, defeatists... far from an ideal situation. The Führer is deeply troubled and wishes for this situation to be corrected. This is precisely the kind of dirty work that our volunteer divisions would be suited for, given their relative lack of target practice prior to the war."
 HGR_loot_pipeline:0 "Loot Pipeline"
 HGR_loot_pipeline_desc:0 "Those Germans who refuse to join us are no better than their treacherous leaders. In due time, these degenerate swine will receive a harsh and well-deserved punishment, but for now we must settle for appropriating anything of value they possess. The property of traitors is ours by right. They are enemies like any others. The flow of loot will pay for our war effort, and we might even find something immediately useful on occasion."
 HGR_whats_yours_is_ours:0 "What's Yours Is Ours"
 HGR_whats_yours_is_ours_desc:0 "If you have not dedicated your life and possessions to our cause, the Führer simply asks: why? Do you care nothing for the Reich? For your race? It is the duty of all true Aryans to place anything that might be required at the Führer's disposal. Right now, everything is required. You must - you WILL - serve. You will serve and give us what we need, or you will die. Make your choice."
 HGR_Waffen_SS:0 "Waffen-SS"
 HGR_Waffen_SS_desc:0 "Where the Burgundians are unwavering fanatics, and the Deutsche-SS are trueborn sons of Germany, the Waffen are the legions that won us the world. Unscrupulous, merciless, obedient without question - not the perfect soldiers, but the best we can hope for, given the circumstances. With the vast legions of the Waffen-SS under the Führer's command, this senseless war will be put to a quick and decisive end."
 HGR_all_the_sons_of_the_reich:0 "All The Sons Of The Reich"
 HGR_all_the_sons_of_the_reich_desc:0 "An army without scruples is a dangerous thing, but the Führer cannot deny its effectiveness. The lack of racial discrimination in the Waffen-SS is concerning, but true Aryan qualities tend to manifest most readily after battle is joined. Opening up the ranks to anyone within the Reich who wishes to enlist would allow for a certain degree of... unwanted influences, but any impurities will be easily washed away by bloodshed. Doubtless such a show of magnanimity will also endear the Führer to the Reich's more uncertain citizens."
 HGR_recruitment_overdrive:0 "Recruitment Overdrive"
 HGR_recruitment_overdrive_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS has never had difficulties with recruitment. In fact, as a result of recent recruitment drives, they already have several new divisions ready to go. Perhaps this demonstrates a lack of oversight on the part of the previous government, but we shall not turn away highly-trained and well-equipped men. The Führer welcomes all who can prove their Aryan credentials in battle."
 HGR_friends_in_bohemia:0 "Friends In Bohemia"
 HGR_friends_in_bohemia_desc:0 "Our comrades in Bohemia have waited long for this moment. They are among the toughest of the Waffen divisions, hardened by years of battle against partisans and boasting large numbers of thoroughly Germanized Czechs to support us. They are not yet ready to join the battle, but they have begun shipping large quantities of weapons to us, all with Bohemian stamps of quality. This material support is the minimum that the Führer expects, but is most welcome regardless."
 HGR_over_the_mountains_high:0 "Over The Mountains"
 HGR_over_the_mountains_high_desc:0 "Finally! The Bohemian SS have assembled their divisions and are making their way through the mountains of the Sudetenland, ready for battle. The trickle of men is slow, as they have had to sneak through enemy lines disguised as refugees, but even these few men will make a difference in our struggle for the Reich."
 HGR_allies_in_ostland:0 "Allies In Ostland"
 HGR_allies_in_ostland_desc:0 "The leader of the Ostland SS, Friedrich Jeckeln, is little more than a glorified bandit. However, he knows his place and has recognized Heydrich as the rightful Führer, despite their personal animosity. He is currently too preoccupied to actually throw his men into the fight - not that he would if it were possible - but can ship spare weapons to us. A meager offering, but guns are guns."
 HGR_the_porous_border:0 "The Porous Border"
 HGR_the_porous_border_desc:0 "It was not only the SS within Germany itself that were preparing for the clash of Führers. All across the Reich, Waffen divisions spent years planning in secret for the day when Heydrich would face his rivals. Now the horn of war is sounded, and they flow into our realm like converging streams, swelling the ranks of the rightful Führer's army. Soon our numbers will dwarf our enemies!"
 HGR_deutsch_warriors_union:0 "Deutsch Warriors"
 HGR_deutsch_warriors_union_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS are the best of the best, and they know it. They were famously tough and skilled when fighting for money alone; with the added motivation of fighting for the rightful Führer, they are all but unstoppable. Their sheer vigor and ferocity in combat is a sight to behold. No amount of corrupt, backwards Heer divisions can hope to stop our pan-Germanic legions."
 HGR_purity_where_we_can_find_it:0 "Purity Where We Can Find It"
 HGR_purity_where_we_can_find_it_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS almost seems more non-German than not. This might concern lesser men, but not the Führer. As the arch-didact of National Socialism, it is he alone who can decide who is and is not Aryan. Purity comes in many forms: sometimes physical, sometimes mental, sometimes spiritual. Though there is obviously still a clear line between 'Aryan' and 'non-Aryan', the matter of 'honorary Aryan' is a different matter entirely. It is a great honor indeed, and the potential to earn it may rest in any man's heart, should he prove willing and noble enough..."
 HGR_a_dark_wave:0 "A Dark Wave"
 HGR_a_dark_wave_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS have endured tremendous casualties fighting for the Führer, but this has not weakened them. Quite the contrary; with every one of their number who dies at enemy hands, they find one more reason to continue fighting. They have become inured to pain and hardship, even more so than before the war began. The fact that many are non-Germans and are fighting their so-called 'oppressors' might also be a factor... but such worries are for lesser men. They will always obey in the end."
 HGR_the_swarm:0 "The Swarm"
 HGR_the_swarm_desc:0 "As the war drags on, the quality of the available Waffen divisions has plummeted. We simply do not have enough trained recruits to replace their losses without diluting their combat effectiveness. With so many of their best now dead, the SS has transformed from a highly-disciplined modern army to a horde that relies more on weight of numbers than superior training. The Führer has made disparaging comparisons to the Red Army, but they still hold the line, and that is all he would ask of them."
 HGR_pushed_on_knifepoint:0 "Pushed On Knife Point"
 HGR_pushed_on_knifepoint_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS are hard men. They have little tolerance for the indolence and weakness of civilians, and a culture of brutal elitism has developed following the degradation of their traditions due to casualties. No longer do they wait for reinforcements; instead, their recruits tend to be drawn from the very people they are in the process of liberating. The image of a Waffen-SS squad rounding up the men of a village and forcing them to choose between service or death is a shockingly common one, but this is the Germanic way of war. The people must learn to understand that the Waffen-SS is the true expression of Aryan militarism: harsh, cold and pitiless."
 HGR_the_commissariat:0 "The Kommissariat"
 HGR_the_commissariat_desc:0 "Keeping such a massive, poorly-organized army in line is incredibly challenging. It is small wonder that the Bolsheviks found it so problematic. Ordinary officers, especially Heydrich's own men, are almost completely unable to exert any control over the Waffen divisions, especially the non-Germans. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formation of a Waffen-SS Kommissar corps. Similar to the National Socialist Leadership Officers, these men will be elevated from their own units and given the power of life and death over officers and enlisted men alike. This way, we shall have reliable political officers who are personally loyal to the Führer and face no language barrier when dealing with the men."

They lack any kind of subtlety, but their propensity for extreme violence makes them an excellent deterrent against partisans, saboteurs and other troublesome types. They are also rowdy, uncontrollable without a Kommissar and don't have any methods of law enforcement besides summary execution - but what cares the Führer when victory is on the line?"
 HGR_who_watches_the_watchmen:0 "Who Watches the Watchmen?"
 HGR_who_watches_the_watchmen_desc:0 "The Führer has grown wary of the Waffen-SS of late. The structure and discipline they displayed early in the war has totally disappeared, replaced with insensate, barbaric rage, total disregard for Aryan lives, and a criminal degree of recklessness. They are still militarily effective, but perhaps... not as reliable as the Führer once thought. The SD must be deployed to keep a close watch on them. One can only hope they don't find out."

There must always be another, a similarly great man, guiding his hand and illuminating the way. Hitler, for all his greatness, was a man of divided vision. The four-way pull between his would-be successors likely helped to tear his mind apart. Heydrich, however, will not be so... changeable. He will have only one guide, one light, one voice whispering in his ear."

The relationship between himself and Reichsführer Himmler has been somewhat turbulent at times despite the importance of their shared mission. He does not wish for the mistakes of the past to bar the way. We must take steps to demonstrate to Herr Himmler that our goals and methods align perfectly, so as to avoid any misunderstandings. If the Reichsführer is concerned about our dedication to pure National Socialism, let us allay his fears and begin the immediate enforcement of proper Spartanist ideals in Germany."
 HGR_stronger_together:0 "Stronger Together"

While the Reichskommissariats are being torn apart by traitors or fighting for their own interests, the Ordenstaat sends its best men to our aid! Three full divisions of disciplined, highly-trained men of the Burgundische-SS are on their way as we speak, ready for the fight.

We have noticed that there are somewhat fewer arms flowing in from Burgundy, and we have had to wait an unusually long time for reinforcements.

 #### EVENTS ###
 
 heydrich_successor.1.t:0 "Open Fire"
 heydrich_successor.1.desc:0 "The day began quietly. At dawn, a group of students gathered around the Central SS Office in Bonn. Using typical student chants and yelling about democracy and vaguely protesting the newfound influence of the Schutzstaffel on the government, the crowd seemed to grow throughout the day. It had to be one of the greatest marches in weeks, at least since Heydrich had been declared successor. It was not surprising, ultimately. \n\nYes, the students protested all authoritarian rule, but the common German family would simply live if their way of live did not seem to be threatened. Heydrich threatened that. The prospect of truly living a Burgundian life, becoming a Spartan, dying en masse for the state. No. That was for Jews and Slavs, not an upstanding, reformist Aryan. So for the first time in what seemed like forever, middle class families began protesting. Timidly, and at first in small number, but they grew and grew. By midday, there must have been a thousand people. They went on, and on, chanting and chanting, and it finally died down a bit. A few departed.\n\nAs soon as they did, three shots rang out from the SS building. Snipers. Three men began screaming. One went silent. The other quieted to a whimper.

For the first time in forever, Burgundy was opening up. They were sending their terrible cargo into Germany.\n\nWorse still, when the trucks finally entered the Reich proper, they always ended up at Schutzstaffel offices and the cities with the most support for the newly appointed successor. Soon enough, there were reports of extravagant SS celebrations, with specially made Burgundian champaign and some of whatever cargo was in those trucks.

With dozens of different orders coming from different commands ordering them to open fire on other army units, the military largely fell into anarchy, matching their home nation. The SS, however, largely avoided this chaos. Already having orders to prepare for battle, and having armed themselves in preparation for this battle for the fate of Germania, the SS was prepared for the struggle, and almost unanimously fell under command of Reinhard Heydrich. Many Wehrmacht garrisons suspected to harbor sympathies against Heydrich were gunned down before they realized that 'Bestellung 88' had arrived, an order authorizing the SS to annihilate any possible rebels before they even come to arms.\n\nSS units have largely centralized around their bases in Danzig or in Elsaß-Lothringen, close to Burgundy, where arms and supplies have already begun flowing in to assist them with their struggle. And although Burgundy has officially claimed neutrality in the struggle so far, all know that Heydrich has Himmler's backing."

Soon after, Heinrich Himmler began his speech, declaring German-Burgundian relations 'restored with an alliance to destroy degeneracy where it stands' among other things.\n\nWhile German-Burgundian relations have soared, the rest of the world has reacted in sharp condemnation, looking on in horror.

That would be Speidel, and his former commander Rommel. At the beginning of our march to return Germany to the correct ideals, he launched a coup to 'protect Germania from the worst'. Now that we have completed our victory, however, his little game will come to an end. Speidel has been ordered to surrender his weapons and re-integrate into Germany properly. Even though it is clear that his decadent ideals have corrupted himself enough to refuse this, perhaps some more... rational thought from his generals may clear things up very quickly.

Citizens have locked themselves in their homes in fear, with some of the more daft Germanians even attempting Communist-like partisan attacks.

Even if our people have raised us concerns on the future state of Germania, whether it will survive the fighting, we are confident enough in our SS to purge the pure capital belonging to the Aryan citizen of any degenerates while ensuring unity and peace remains.

In front of it stood Werner Grothmann, still as a statue in a perfect SS uniform. Heydrich could smell toad as he approached, but said nothing. Grothmann was close to Himmler, and worthy of respect for that, if nothing else.\n\n"Heil Himmler! Heil mein Führer!"

Instead the man just sat and stared at Heydrich's face, blinking exactly seven times every minute — besides one where he only blinked six — in order to see if the puppet Führer reacted with horror of awe.\n\nInstead he got nothing, most likely as he expected.

As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."
