POLITICS_LU_HAN_DESC_1:0 "Lu Han, the lawbringer. Lu Han, the hero of the south. Lu Han, the keeper of national pride. Every day these words, and many others, reverberate through the government centers, schools, businesses, and shops of Yunnan. For they have been taught to worship their liberator, the man who freed the peasants of the landlords. \n\nOf course, he did nothing of the sort. The peasants are still enslaved, the villages are still poor, the national pride is still in shambles, and the country is still ridden with crime. Under Lu, it doesn't look like it will be changing any time soon."

POLITICS_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "룽윈은 과거의 유령입니다. 한때 운남성의 군벌이었던 그는, 그를 감금하고, 고문하고, 그의 아들을 죽이고, 운남을 일본에 항복시키고 룽윈을 뒤틀린 죄책감과 연민으로 살려둔 그의 사촌 루한에게 배신당했습니다.\n\n이 경험들은 룽윈을 변화시켰습니다. 어찌 그러지 않을 수 있겠습니까? 그의 마음은 망가졌습니다,혹은 그의 인생에서 처음으로 바르게 생각하게 된 것일지도 모르지요. 그는 중국이 어떤지 보았습니다: 부패한, 비겁함과 수치심으로 오염된 잿빛 땅. 그러나 그는 또한 새로운 중국을 보았으며, 과거에서 새로 태어나기 위해 투쟁하고 있습니다.\n\n룽윈은 그가 중국을 검고 빛나는 미래로 이끌 것을 압니다. 그의 지도하에, 부역자들은 유황굴에 던져질것이고, 일본인들은 에덴 동산에서 쫒겨날것이고, 나팔소리에 소환된 기수들은 중국을 새 시대로 안내할 것입니다.\n\n중국은 반드시 자유로워질것 입니다, 비록 세계의 나머지 부분이 불탈지라도."
POLITICS_NPA_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "The Last Stand has failed. Long Yun, the great liberator of China, is dead. With the Mad King of the Southwest now another annal of China's long and troubled history, the remnants of the National Protection Army stand headless. While some still desperately clinging on to the late general's dream of liberation, others have already surrendered or disappeared into the southwestern mountains, now free from Long's reign."

 YUN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In 1946 Yunnan was one of the few places in China not yet conquered by the Japanese. Seeing the inevitability of Japanese victory and ever more put off by Long Yun's vows to "fight to the last", Lu Han seized the state and pledged the province's allegiance to Japan and their Chinese puppet republic before Yunnan was overrun. In the years since Lu Han has kept his hold on power, however narrow his true support. Han has worked to both bring Guizhou into his "protection" and ensure the stability and development of his home state. Yunnan has come to be known as the protector of the southwest and a profitable area to invest in, so long as you know the right people. However, all this stems from the stability of Lu Han's government, while the winds of change blow where they may..."

yun.1.t:0 "우리의 상황"
yun.1.desc:0 "On the southern frontier of what was once China sits a state most people do not know of. A serene little state, picturesque and mountainous, covered in dense forests that buzz with every variety of life you can find this side of paradise.\n\nSee the peasant who tills the fields, who works the mines and carries tremendous weight on their backs for many miles. Lu Han overthrew the foolish nationalistic government in a military coup and has since sought ever closer relations with his two main allies. Within Yunnan are the Yi people, a minority who owns most of the land in Yunnan and of whom Lu Han is their rightful leader. Outside of Yunnan the Yunnan clique answers only to the Imperial throne of Japan. By maintaining this balance between the wealthy privileged elite at home and the wealthy mighty overlords abroad Lu Han ensures his own, and by extension Yunnan's, safety and security.\n\nDespite being what the unkind and foolish may label a "warlord" Lu Han has very little interest in warring. Indeed under his leadership the army has been severely reduced to lower the burden on the budget of the great state of Yunnan, to show the world the peaceful intentions of the splendid realm to the south-west and to ensure no upstart dare do to Lu Han what Lu Han did to gain power in the first place.\n\nOur wealth is in the soil, of that there is no dispute. We extract, we sell. We harvest, we sell. Other's twist the raw material of nature into the wonders of civilization, let us provide the firmament.\n\nBut we must not forget our place. An enemy awaits around every corner, even within our borders the enemy awaits. We must tread carefully but forcefully. On sure feet we march towards a better future.\n\nFor Yunnan. For China. For Lu Han!"
yun.1.a:0 "전진!"

yun.2.t:0 "주석의 새로운 발견!"
yun.2.desc:0 "An archaeological project being undertaken by all three members of the Kunming Antiquarian Society has been attempting to uncover an ancient village that was burned down during the Taiping rebellion. Early efforts have been promising, already enough sherds to fill a wheelbarrow have been uncovered and the foundations of a large stone house have made them very excited. Far more impressively, an agent of ours has relayed that these three antiquarians have accidentally discovered a very promising vein of tin.\n\nA surveyor dispatched from Kunming has written back explaining that not only have they found a single promising vein, but that the whole local area is dotted with veins and outcroppings which suggest that it is the ideal place to begin a whole complex of mines. Tin is one of our biggest exports already and building up our raw material extraction can only bring good things into this great state. Mineral wealth is the wealth of kings, it is the wealth of the gods and it shall be the wealth of Yunnan.\n\nWe were fully prepared to seize it from it's current owners when we were pleasantly surprised to learn that the site already belongs to the government, we must merely decide what to do with it.\n\nBefore we sign off on this decision we need to address a letter we have received from the Kunming Antiquarian Society begging us to give them just a few more days to remove everything of historical significance from the site."
yun.2.a:0 "Permission Denied."

yun.3.t:0 "입찰 시작"
yun.3.desc:0 "News moves slowly in Yunnan. An instruction can be sent to a provincial office and they can spend weeks deliberating their answer before sending it back. It can take months for couriers to carry messages from the sticks to the halls of power. A cousin of the minister for financial affairs insisted she found a village in the south that still thought Yuan Shikai was the emperor. So when twenty communiques are received in one day the office goes into a bit of a panic.\n\nIt seems everyone wants to get their hands on our tin. Tin for bronze. Tin for canned goods. Tin for all the sphere, flowing from Yunnan. We thought we'd make a little bit of money. Well, we're not: We're going to make a tremendous amount of money. Early estimates have already been exceeded.\n\nThe advantage we have right now is that this is a secret auction. None of the interested parties making the bids know how much anyone else is also bidding. This is going to spread like the wildfire we had last year, only we won't have to cover this one up."
yun.3.a:0 "가장 높은 입찰자가 이긴다."

yun.4.t:0 "올바른 방향으로 살짝?"
yun.4.desc:0 "There's a side bet in the office as to who's going to get the contract. The Zaibatsus have the most capital but the least interest. The Reorganized Government wants to build up Chinese industries with Chinese resources, and they may well seek a symbolic victory over our mutual masters. The best odds are on neither of these two, but on the perennial favorite, the locals. A cabal of Yi landowners, keen to maintain their hegemony over Yunnan's land and industry, are scrambling to pool enough resources together to compete with the big boys.\n\nThis auction doesn't need to be left up to chance. We can put a thumb on the scales, after all only we know what the bids are. We could favour our own people, ensuring that the great state of Yunnan will be made ever greater by keeping our hands in our own pockets. We could favor the Republic, drawing Yunnan and China close again once more. Or we could favor the Japanese, opening the door to the ruthless exploitation and advanced mining techniques of the Zaibatsus."

yun.5.t:0 "일본이 입찰에서 이겼다"
yun.5.desc:0 "It would seem that we are some fine alchemists indeed, for we have turned tin into gold.\n\nThe factories of the empire have an endless hunger for our sweet mineral fruit and we are more than content to let them pluck it from out hanging branch. Even as we speak workers and engineers are flocking to Yunnan from across the sphere to start a high tech, modern institution of extraction and exploitation.\n\nNot all is well, however. With great profits comes great suffering. The village we turned out to house the engineers are homeless and destitute. The farmers who are unfortunate to live close to the new mine can only watch as their crops succumb to sickness. The Yi landowners, who see this as the beginning of the end for their hegemony, turn their great wealth against the government. The Reorganized Chinese government and the millions of people in our country who support it protest in the streets. Even the Japanese government is annoyed, seeing us as little more than a sideshow.\n\nStill, just because our neighbors, our superiors, our inferiors and most of our own people are worse off, doesn't necessarily mean that we are. Japan will benefit, we will surely benefit. The auction is over and we had hoped for a little more, but no matter.\n\nThe money we have made from this interaction is the important thing. If we carefully manage this we can bring our countrymen around to the reality of the situation and push Yunnan into the twentieth century with any luck before we reach the twenty first century.\n\nOne can't help but wonder if we might've been better off had our own people or the government of China won the auction, then at least we would've been an important part of a partnership, not just another exploited state. But we can't go back in time, the auction is over."

yun.6.desc:0 "Confucius taught us the importance of filial piety. The Reorganized Government in Nanjing is the elder brother to the strong and stable government we enjoy here in Kunming. We owe our brother's all the support we can give, just as we are owed all the support they can give to us in return. For this reason we have decided to keep it in the family and ensure that Chinese tin stays in Chinese hands.\n\nThey may not have the same resources to offer us as do our overlords in Tokyo, but there comes a time when it is not enough to think of money, but to think of countries, of peoples and the long term goals of all the Chinese peoples. We won't ask what our country can do for us, but rather we shall ask what we can do for our country.\n\nThis decision is not merely high minded, it will have useful practical benefits as well. Not only is it always wise to be friendly with your neighbors, but many of our people still stubbornly identify with China as a whole, refusing to recognize the natural splendor of the great state of Yunnan. A compromise is of course possible.\n\nYunnan must take her rightful place not above China, but at the top of the Chinese nation. We are the glistening, glittering mountain jewel of our people. We are the endless treasure chest of our splendid nation. We are the state of Yunnan, but we are the country of China.\n\nIt will be difficult to 'adjust' the auction so that China wins, but we have ways and means."

A fire rages in the hotel where, coincidentally, agents from both Yunnan and China were meeting to ensure the Republic's victory in the auction.\n\nApparently they weren't as inconspicuous as they believed and were trailed by several Kenpeitai operatives who organized the conflagration.\n\nAlthough officially denying responsibility, Tokyo is screaming at us down the other end concerning documents that they "received" from a "whistleblower". They've raised their bid to ensure they win but now we're under close scrutiny. We'll not be allowed to forget this.\n\nAs for the rest of the sphere, we're in a bit of an embarrassment. Even the Reorganized Government, who should theoretically be on our side in all of this, has stopped giving us the time of day. We've implicated them in our own mistake, without asking them if they even wanted the help. We're the black sheep of the sphere."
yun.7.a:0 "Well, we tried."

yun.8.t:0 "우리 스스로 하기"
yun.8.desc:0 "No man becomes rich by giving things away. As it is for men, so it is for states as great as Yunnan.\n\nThe wealthy hands of Nanjing and Tokyo are grasping at our trousers, but our pockets belong to our own hands, thank you very much! The Yi landowners who are such an important part of our society have expressed an interest in our new tin reserve. They have come together in a bit of a cabal to put forward a serious bid on the site. Their efforts are laudable, as well as most certainly patriotic, but they're not exactly up to scratch.\n\nHowever plucky our local landlords may be they just don't have the resources to compete with the great corporations of Japan or the vested interests of the Reorganized Government. Even putting their slaves on the table they can't meet half the biggest offer we've got from abroad.\n\nBut then again, only we know that.\n\nWe're going to ensure that our own investors get the land. They deserve it, they're the hardworking landowners and slave traders who make this country work. It is our noble obligation as their government to protect them and their interests from foreign interference, even if the interference is legal and purely economic.\n\nFurthermore, while both the Reorganized Government and the Japanese would simply pay us a lump sum then extract as much wealth as they can physically get and stash it in their treasuries. This way the wealth we rip from the Earth will circulate inside Yunnan for much, much longer.\n\nWe are nothing if not a state that works, a worker state, and like all workers we simply want to keep as much of our earnings as we can.\n\nFurthermore if we make it purely a domestic venture we can waive all those pesky regulations and high wages and ensure that the local villagers have something to do all day."
yun.8.a:0 "Profit comes first."
yun.8.a.tt:0 "We will give the §Yi Landowners§! of [YUN.GetFlag]§YYunnan§! an §Gadvantage§! during the bidding process.\n\n"

yun.9.t:0 "떠오르는 태양이 입찰액을 올리다"
yun.9.desc:0 "The stoic mountains of Yunnan are a solid manifestation of serene beauty. An immortal fact of reality that we mortals weave our petty human notions of cities and nations around. Every peak, every valley is a symbol of our pride and our dedication.\n\nYunnan may be made of stone, but our hearts are not. We sincerely wanted to benefit the Yi landowners. We really believed that it was in our economic interest to keep the material wealth of this nation inside this nation, not to carry it over worn out roads to foreign masters thousands of miles away.\n\nFor this lofty goal we were willing to fudge our numbers, to artificially double the bid of the Yi landowners, putting them just in the lead. But then the Japanese raised their bid. Oh my did they raise their bid.\n\nThey didn't double it. They added zeroes. We can't resist that kind of money, we can't match it, even by fiddling the books. We have no choice.\n\nBut on the plus side, we are going to make so much money. A truly ludicrous sum of money.\n\nThe economic benefits of selling out our morals is great, but selling out from selling out pays even better!\n\nIt's vitally important we realise that this of a benefit to Yunnan. It is far more important that the Yi landowners understand that this in their interest too. It isn't but they live in Yunnan, and Yunnan is going to benefit, so really they'll benefit too.\n\nA new age of investment and development awaits us. A new deal, where no peasant will ever be idle, no landowner will ever be poor. Yunnan is great, and it shall be greater still."
yun.9.a:0 "돈은 돈이지."

yun.10.t:0 "우리 주인에게의 양보"
yun.10.desc:0 "Confucius teaches us the virtue of filial piety. A son owed his father a tremendous debt. So too does the subject owe their master fealty, just as the master owes their subject good governance.\n\nThe hand of our own people reaches towards us, begging for scraps they can't afford. But we can't afford to be charitable. The hand of our countrymen reaches towards us, along with words of comradeship and friendship. But we don't need comrades and we certainly don't need friends. The hand of our overlord reaches down to us from on high, reminding us of our duties and promising a better place in the sphere, to be higher than we are beneath his Imperial majesty.\n\nWe will not bite the hand that feeds us, even if first it steals that food from our own hands.\n\nThere is no shame in brown-nosing to the people who hold all of our lives in their hands. We are a dog, so let us pick a rich family to live in. No family in Asia is as rich as the sphere, and Imperial Japan is the father we must impress to earn a place by his side.\n\nIt is a noble thing to serve, but it is also a profitable thing. We will ensure by our extralegal meddling that Japan attains the tin rights. We will ensure that we have a healthy and profitable relationship with the worlds best superpower. We will ensure that Japan always remembers how loyal we are, how profitable we are an investment and how important our rights and interests are in the wider context of China.\n\nIndependence is for tramps. Codependence is for marriages. Supplication is the path to becoming a great nation in this fractured and dangerous world."

He bent over, hands on his knees, and took long, deep breaths until his heart stopped fluttering and the world stopped spinning. He shook his head and stood up straight.\n\n"I'm okay." he thought, lying to himself. "I just need to check through the prisoners one more time and then-"\n\nFar away from him, climbing the prison fence, was an escaping prisoner.\n\n"A prisoner is escaping!" he yelled, his face flushing red from lack of oxygen. "Someone get him!"\n\nThe soldiers patrolling the prison grounds quickly turned to face the prisoner and ran towards him. The escapee dragged himself over the fence and fell to the ground on the other side. He groaned, picked himself up, and began sprinting towards the treeline."

High above in the watchtowers, riflemen began taking potshots, hoping to land a lucky hit. The sound of gunshots and yells filled the air, exciting the recaptured criminals within the prison who rattled their bars and hollered encouragement for their escaped comrade.\n\nThe pursuing soldier, realizing he would be unable to catch the remarkably athletic prisoner, stopped, kneeled, aimed his rifle, and fired once - The bullet whizzed past the target.\n\nTwice - The bullet grazed the prisoner's leg, turning the white cotton red.\n\nThrice - The bullet flew true and ripped through the back of the prisoner's neck.\n\nThe prisoner collapsed forward and slammed into the ground. Blood gushed from his neck in thick spurts, pooling around his head. His killer ran over to him and turned his body over to identify his victim.\n\nThe soldier stared down.\n\nLong Yun stared back.\n\nHe looked beyond the young soldier and gazed at the sky.\n\nHis last thoughts were of the beautiful blue emptiness covering China."

One by one, they broke ranks and gathered around him, in opposition to the sergeant.\n\nThe name "Long Yun" spread through the men like an infectious virus. Soon, Hu Ruoyu's small army had divided in two factions: the growing Yun defectors and the shrinking loyalists.\n\nHu Ruoyu could not believe his eyes. His own men - Traitors!

He slowly examined his audience, his eyes passing over everyone, including Hu Ruoyu, with apparent disinterest.\n\nNo one spoke.\n\n"Have we let ourselves fall so low?" Long Yun spat, breaking the silence. "Do we take orders from this" He pointed at Hu Ruyou. "vermin of a man?"\n\nStill, all were silent.\n\n"Well!?" Long Yun screamed.

He saw the pieces move back and forth as the battle progressed. He saw the red advance and the blue topple over. It was a swirling purple whirlwind that slowly, but inexorably, squeezed closer and closer to the center of the map, to his bunker, until it was a neat pattern of upright red and horizontal blue.\n\n"I don't know." he sighed. "Maybe I thought that everything here," he said, gesturing beyond the bunker, to the province of Xinan. "Was worth protecting. It doesn't really matter if it is now."

These wretched rats did not even have the compassion to wait until the morning. Long Yun glanced out the window, now was probably the appropriate place. Reaching into a green box, he retrieved a singular grenade, pulled the pin and tossed it out into the woods. A colorful display of red and orange brightened the sleepy forests. The blast gave the raiding party a moment of pause, a moment where each soldier was forced to consider their next move, and then came the gunfire. It was not a long battle, most deserted and slipped back into the woods but those who remained faced justice from the Mad King himself."

His thoughts were plagued with questions. Why would he ever accept this? Why would Long Yun ever agree to this? When would his envoy be here? Qiao shifted his weight as his eyes scanned the room, Long Yun isn't stupid and he pledged to be punctual. Something was amiss. The weight of the situation started to set in, the occupants of the warehouse did little to keep him company. Boxes filled to the brim with Yen sat to his back and his rusty pistol hung on his waist. Trying to calm his nerves, he picked up the pistol and began to toss it between his hands. He began to relax and hum a tune as he waited, and waited, and waited. He slouched up against the wall, his eyelids becoming heavy. Before he fully dozed off, the door flung open with a thud. Qiao sprung to life, stammering to explain his poor first impression. His explanation was not responded with reprimand but with bullets. The young man never saw the barrage of fire explode from the doorway nor the squad of men file in afterward to confiscate the hundreds of thousands of Yen.\n\n Long Yun paraded down the city proudly displaying the crates of Yen. The general parked in the city square and dropped the boxes from atop his truck. Standing on the roof, the powerful orator spoke before the growing crowd.\n\n"I was contacted by the Japanese puppets in Nanjing within the last week. We have shaken them to their core to their point where they are trying to buy our subservience with scraps of paper! Money is the one and only vile language of the Sphere. Here is what I say to them!" The soldiers broke from standing at attention, poured gasoline on top of the Yen, struck a match and threw it in. The King of Yunnan's loyal subjects cheered and his soldiers saluted as he continued, "China cannot be bought! We can't be tamed like the rest of the suits in Nanjing. The spirit of China cannot be bought and sold like some Japanese commodity! The puppet master will continue to attempt to sway us or to beat us into accepting the death of China but they will never succeed."

The sticks were well used last night, as the import and home goods warehouse on the corner of Lu Han st. and Five Mountain ave. went up in a column of spitting fire. The fire spread only to the two nearest warehouses before the fire department martialled the workers to bring the other warehouses crashing down. The speed at which this strategic demolition was carried out is a triumph of deregulation. In addition to imports and home goods, a warehouse full of 'genuine' Japanese rice-wine and another full of coal for domestic use continue to burn until now, and show no signs of abating.\n\nThe fire was likely started by an enemy of the state, eager to spread discord and chaos amongst our fine city. The current top suspect is one Zhang Wei, a recently hired worker who previously had been a free peasant in a northern village. Anger at the mining company that threw him from his ancestral land, as well as his descent from comfortable frugality to abject poverty, fostered a sickening anti-authoritarian sentiment in the young man. Under interrogation, the terrorists friends revealed that he also harboured rage at the system itself, being reduced to handling luxury goods that on his wages he could never hope to afford. \n\nAs a precaution we've arrested every member of his village in Kunming, as well as a number of other suspects. All in all, the fire has cost the city tens of thousands of Yuan and a couple dozen workers. The recently imprisoned suspects have been rushed to the scene to help with clean up and repairs.

YUN_in_the_west_desc:0 "Without the aid of the capital and below the notice of the Japanese, the people of the Southwest must fend for themselves. In the mountains and fields we have only ourselves to turn to for justice, order and progress, and it is Lu Han to whom we turn."
YUN_everything_for_my_friends:0 "Everything For My Friends"
YUN_everything_for_my_friends_desc:0 "It is only natural that those who would play such a prominent role in both the stability and advancement of Yunnan would be rewarded in turn. Lu Han would not even think of his good friends and allies having anything less than the first pick of the province. After all, they earned it."
YUN_the_law_for_my_enemies:0 "The Law For My Enemies"
YUN_the_law_for_my_enemies_desc:0 "Slander and lies have no place in Yunnan, at least not when they are in opposition to the government. The law is quite clear about what happens to those found guilty of... whatever the courts find them guilty of. And the courts know their duty well."
YUN_minerals_for_those_who_can_pay:0 "Minerals For Those Who Can Pay"
YUN_minerals_for_those_who_can_pay_desc:0 "Yunnan has been blessed with an abundance of resources lying within the ground, and cursed with a drought of cash with which to access it. A newly discovered deposit may send investors scurrying to Lu Han to gain his favor and slander their opponents, but in the end Lu Han must accept payment from where the capital flows, so long as it does flow."
YUN_one_more_bandit_hunt:0 "One More Bandit Hunt"
YUN_one_more_bandit_hunt_desc:0 "The bandits and communists which once roamed the land with impunity have largely been put in their place, either dead or having fled to Xikang in hopes of "employment". But there is one last thorn in the side of Yunnan, one group which insists on raiding from their mountain hideout. A hideout which has just been found. The call from Lu Han was immediate: Every unit would march to the mountains, including those in Guizhou! One more victory for the army, united under Lu Han!"
YUN_crush_the_rats:0 "Crush The Rats!"
YUN_crush_the_rats_desc:0 "With this victory the last challenge to Lu's authority will be crushed. With this victory the army will be truly united. With this victory the Southwest, long divided, may finally come together in unity. Perhaps even in reality, as well as spirit. So now charge, and crush these parasites to dust!"
YUN_the_two_brothers:0 "The Two Brothers"
YUN_the_two_brothers_desc:0 "Like brothers Yunnan and Guizhou have stood together against anarchy, against secession, and like brothers they have come to love each other and cooperate in everything. One army, one china, one spirit... why not one ruler as well? The unification of our two states is only natural, and as Lu Han puts his sights on this worthy goal there is no one who can stop him."

YUN_evict_he_yingqin_desc:0 "He's recent relaxation of power has proven that the old man is on his last legs, and we can no longer rely on him to ensure order and progress in the southwest. Simply removing He Yingqin from office will be fast and painless, not to mention little more than an official recognition of reality. The army and people are ours, and now the land shall be as well."
YUN_setting_the_trap:0 "Setting The Trap"
YUN_setting_the_trap_desc:0 "He Yingqin has retreated into his study for who knows what purpose, protected only by a tiny personal staff. With only one road in and out it makes for the perfect place to pin down He and ensure that the consolidation goes off without a hitch.

YUN_pick_up_his_friends_desc:0 "He is hardly the only man in Guizhou who demands our attention, indeed the few officers disloyal to Lu Han and the men of means must either be bribed or otherwise neutralized during the merger. Of course, it would not do to be disrespectful to men of such standing, we merely want them to understand that now would be an excellent time to vacation."
YUN_a_mans_home:0 "A Man's Home Is His Castle"
YUN_a_mans_home_desc:0 "The trap is ready! Men wait only for our orders to advance and surround He Yingqin's estate. We can only hope that He himself will be forthcoming in bowing to the inevitable. If he does not, then we shall see how strong his walls truly are. For the southwest! For Lu Han!"
YUN_safe_and_sound:0 "Safe and Sound"
YUN_safe_and_sound_desc:0 "He is too dangerous to let out of our sight, even if he is weak. Thankfully we have a prison in Heqing just for people like him. Alongside the likes of Long Yun and Xue Yue He Yingqin will be kept perfectly impotent for the rest of his days, as China moves on without him."
YUN_out_of_sight_out_of_mind:0 "Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind"
YUN_out_of_sight_out_of_mind_desc:0 "He is too dangerous to keep within our lands, even if he is a fool. We should acquire a comfortable and secure method of removing He from his old powerbase and into the new world of obscurity. A few conversations with the RGOC officials should be more than enough to make the trip quick and easy."
YUN_a_formal_announcement:0 "A Formal Announcement"
YUN_a_formal_announcement_desc:0 "With He Yingqin removed and the two provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou firmly under Lu Han's control all that remains is for the formal announcement of the creation of Asia's newest state: Xīnán. At the head of his closest officers Lu Han made his speech, and soon correspondence with the rest of the sphere shall notify all."
YUN_one_and_indivisible:0 "One And Indivisible"
YUN_one_and_indivisible_desc:0 "On this day, in this place, the lands once known as Yunnan and Guizhou were finally united under the benevolent guidance of Lu Han and took for themselves a new name: Xīnán.

YUN_arranging_a_conference:0 "Arranging A Conference"
YUN_arranging_a_conference_desc:0 "Talking may be a boring and lengthy process, but no one can doubt that it is at least cheaper than war. Arranging a date and location for the "Discussion of the Future of the Southwest Provinces" is of course only the first step, but no doubt it will take time to arrange a venue deserving of this momentous occasion."
YUN_winning_friends:0 "Winning Friends"
YUN_winning_friends_desc:0 "Lu Han has many friends, and he knows just how to keep them: money. It seems that in his recent relaxation He Yingqin has been forgetful of his old friends, a mistake that Lu promises will not be repeated under his supervision. Meeting with industrialists, politicians, landlords and even an artist has consumed Lu Han's time; it would not do to be impersonal at this time."
YUN_opening_the_debate:0 "Opening The Debate"
YUN_opening_the_debate_desc:0 "A city has been chosen, and invitations sent out. Delegates carefully chosen for their enthusiasm for unification shall of course form the body, and despite He's lone resistance the debate shall soon be started with or without him and the few friends he has left. It has been made clear that it would be better to have his voice be present at negotiations, rather than not be present at all."
YUN_two_hands_of_one_body:0 "Two Hands Of One Body"
YUN_two_hands_of_one_body_desc:0 "While Yunnan and Guizhou may be brothers in all but name, their economies have developed in different directions by necessity, with different companies taking different approaches to the exploitation of China's resources. While the idea of economic uniformity may be romantic, for the sake of common prosperity we should make the merger be one of politics only, and let the market continue its own course."
YUN_closed_to_yi_exploitation:0 "Closed To Yi Exploitation"
YUN_closed_to_yi_exploitation_desc:0 "The people of Guizhou are sadly less enthusiastic about the incoming unification than we are, with rumours abounding about plans to enslave and exploit the people, and bloody crackdowns on disent. Simply promising not to alter the laws of the land would go a long way toward calming the people and ensuring the merger is as successful as possible."
YUN_a_place_for_he:0 "A Place For He"
YUN_a_place_for_he_desc:0 "He was and is a great general, a competent administrator, and he knows the province of Guizhou better than any other man in China. While he agrees to step down as a provincial governor, installing He Yingqin as governor or regional advisor would guarantee a swift and seemly transition of power as well as pay respect to He's service to the country and her people."
YUN_united_economy:0 "United Economy"
YUN_united_economy_desc:0 "No split may divide the south west, no artificial barriers may stop unification. While keeping the economies unintegrated may let a few fat cats keep their riches it will also permanently divide the new province. What is the point of going to all this trouble if nothing of substance changes? Not to mention, the unification has gotten up the hopes of many of our own Yi entrepreneurs who would be very disappointed should the unification be only in name."
YUN_uniform_legal_code:0 "Uniform Legal Code"
YUN_uniform_legal_code_desc:0 "Break one law? Just hope over the border and you are scot free! Chaos in trade, in the media, in everyday life is the only reward for being so lazy as to unify without actually unifying! The laws of Yunnan were approved by Lu Han himself, and were virtually identical to Guizhou's until recent years. We would be doing a disservice by accepting anything less than total uniformity."
YUN_he_must_retire:0 "He Must Retire"
YUN_he_must_retire_desc:0 "No one doubts He Yingqin's record in the past and we have much to thank him for. But in recent years he has become reserved, retrieting into his palace and delegating ever more authority to those unworthy of it. Not to mention, should He remain in power all those who would resist this merging of provinces will rally to him, whether he desires it or not. An honorable retirement is in order, but He must go."
YUN_a_handshake:0 "A Handshake"
YUN_a_handshake_desc:0 "With the debate over all that is left is for the vote on integration. Most consider it to be a foregone conclusion, but before the votes are counted all eyes are on He Yingqin and Lu Han, to seal the arrangement with a handshake."
YUN_a_ceremony:0 "A Ceremony"
YUN_a_ceremony_desc:0 "The die is cast, and the map will be redrawn! Let all of asia know: The provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou shall, by mutual agreement, soon be merged into the province of the southwest: Xīnán. The start of this new era has been accompanied by parades, bands, grand dinners and all the other melodrama of state. Let the people rejoice!"
YUN_a_promise:0 "A Promise"
YUN_a_promise_desc:0 "With the announcement over and the deadline drawing near it is only expected that those patriots who bravely aided the creation of Xīnán be rewarded in turn. And they all intend to ensure Lu Han is aware of that fact. Land, gold, currency, positions in the administration and protection from the free market has all been promised. And what kind of man would Lu be if he were not true to his word?"
YUN_united_at_last:0 "United At Last"
YUN_united_at_last_desc:0 "The final disruptions are over, the names have been changed and the world notified. All that is left now is for Lu Han himself to make the trip and officially declare the work of government to begin. Two brothers no more, today the name Xīnán shall be spoken across all of Asia, and let no man separate what has been unified!"

###Post-Unification Minitree###
YUN_on_solid_ground:0 "On Solid Ground"
YUN_on_solid_ground_desc:0 "At long last our hopes have become reality. Yunnan and Guizhou are both under the rule of Lu Han, and the Yunnan clique has come to protect another province. While we faced unrest and protest from some the result was never truly in doubt: one state, one army, one leader. As the maps are redrawn and streets renamed we are finally in a position to advance with order and progress unimpeded."
YUN_bring_in_the_investment:0 "Bring In The Investment"
YUN_bring_in_the_investment_desc:0 "Perhaps unavoidably investment both from outside individuals and our own native entrepreneurs ground to a halt in the recent instability. Now that our state is settled it is time to announce ourselves open to investment from all the sphere. Many local monopolies and leftovers of He's rule have to be removed from the stage, and the time has never been better for the development of the land or the prosperity of all Asia!"
YUN_bring_in_the_talent:0 "Bring In The Talent"
YUN_bring_in_the_talent_desc:0 "Whether from the esteemed ranks of our own notable men or from Japanese-trained company men, the factories cannot function without able technicians and experienced administrators to run them. Let it be known that Xīnán is a land of opportunity and cheap labor for those who would lay hold of it."
YUN_a_united_southwest:0 "A United Xinan"
YUN_a_united_southwest_desc:0 "Just as Yunnan was ordered under Lu Han and his chosen few, so too shall Guizhou be incorporated into the new state. With one vision we have unified the Southwest and none shall come between the people of the Southwest again. It is important that we make sure the people themselves understand that fact."
YUN_biased_land_distribution:0 "Biased Land Distribution"
YUN_biased_land_distribution_desc:0 "He Yingqin himself held not inconsiderable land, and the same can be said of many of his old allies. Their lands now lay open, with their laborers anxious to learn what will become of them. Naturally those close to Lu Han as well as those who have been so instrumental in the creation of Xīnán ought to be given first pick of the unowned land, and a simple vetted auction will quite easily take... some of this land off of Lu's hands. Some shall be acquired by Lu Han himself, naturally."
YUN_two_brothers_still:0 "Two Brothers Still"
YUN_two_brothers_still_desc:0 "While the names have been changed and the borders have been redrawn, the simple fact remains that Yunnan and Guizhou are not the same land and cannot be treated as such. Under the watchful eye of Lu Han only the highest level of administration shall be fully changed, and local life may go on much as it has before the merging of the two. The boss's boss may change and the taxes are paid to a different man, but it is best not to offend unnecessarily."
YUN_rational_infrastructure:0 "Rational Infrastructure"
YUN_rational_infrastructure_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest enemy of wealth in Xīnán is its poor infrastructure. Winding through mountains the roads often lead to nowhere, or to towns long since declined after the war. As the ruler of two provinces it is finally possible to rationalize and connect the infrastructure of both, with all the benefits which accompany such endeavors."
YUN_let_the_work_begin:0 "Let The Work Begin"
YUN_let_the_work_begin_desc:0 "Order has finally been restored to the lands of Xīnán. United and whole the investment of both money and talent has started to accumulate in the cities and in the fields. We have achieved recognition the world over. In this new era of stability economic progress shall continue on without end, and the families closest to Lu Han shall be at the forefront of it. Let the new work begin!"

YUN_playing_to_our_strengths_desc:0 "The great state of Xinan has been undervalued by the establishment in Nanjing and Tokyo. Our fields and forests grow thick with produce. Our mines are deep and well-dug. Our peasants work as hard and for as little pay as any peasant in the whole Sphere.\n\nBut there is room here for improvement. Our fields are great but still too small, too ancient in their design. Our mines could be dug so much deeper, so much more greedily, and our peasants often have enough time in the day to partake in indolence, and they would not suffer much to be a little hungrier.\n\nWe understand that this is not the conventional wisdom. The Re-organized Government seeks to move beyond being a 'mere' breadbasket, This suits us in two ways. First of all the demand for raw materials grows ever stronger as new factories flicker into life, and second of all the stomach of the sphere will grow no less hungry as the cities rise and sprawl from the dirt like the wild mushrooms we export in great, yet inadequate quantities.\n\nWe will seize the mantle as the true 'breadbasket' of the sphere, and Xinan will provide the raw firmament they shall twist into the miracles of a new age."
YUN_survey_the_land:0 "Survey the Land"
YUN_survey_the_land_desc:0 "Many of our mines have been in operation for hundreds of years. This isn't an issue on its own, but it reveals a shocking lack of progress in this, the cornerstone of our economy. Our landscape is draped in mountains and plateaus, the buried bounty of the Earth lies just beyond our grasp. But not for long. We must bring our eyes to bare upon these resources, opening bold new avenues of tin, lead, zinc, iron, silver, gold and coal, as well as a hundred other roads that we shall take to prosperity. \n\nFor this task the few experts we have to hand will be rallied, along with a few experts in geology, geography, metallurgy and the mining industry from as far away as Manchuria. The likely candidates first, near existing mines. After these have been examined we shall move on to new pastures that we shall rip up and exploit. Once we have the facilities in place, all gathered under a new 'Bureau of expansion, efficiency and exploitation', we shall methodically and thoroughly examine the country for likely sites. The land must be numbered, weighed for it's potential and divided into new zones for development.\n\nSome of these developments will be resisted by reactionary elements who fear progress. They will protest that we would destroy their villages, their forests and their fields. But the march of time is inexorable, We have not yet begun the survey, but the writing is on the wall."

If local stocks are inadequate, we have agents in our neighbours seeking emergency ribbon suppliers. A junior member of the bureau of expansion, efficiency and exploitation has suggested we delay the opening ceremonies of certain mines to save on expenses.\n\nAfter firing him we have come slightly closer to a great leap forward, towards full exploitation of our natural resources. This is a tremendous moment for dozens of communities around Xinan who will soon have access to exciting new jobs in our mineshafts. Some villages in the end did have to be relocated, but their employment in making Xinan the master of metals is an opportunity we are sure they would thank us for if we ever ask them.\n\n Having said that, a debate still rages in Kunming over the precise colour and type of ribbon to be used.

YUN_japanese_equipment_desc:0 "It's not our peasants fault that their frail bodies and lazy souls are inadequate for our needs. It is their fault that their home-made tools keep breaking when put under the necessary stresses of a modern mining environment. Even the tools made by our small manufacturing base prove inadequate. No one in Xinan thinks big enough to make the tools we need!\n\nFor this reason we must look further afield for our tools. The mines of the Reorganized Government and Manchuria are both seeking to modernise, meaning that much of their old equipment is going to be for sale. We will be a welcome market for these cast-offs, but more excitingly a number of Japanese manufacturers have took notice of our efforts, and have contacted us offering to sell the latest in drilling, extracting and processing technology. For an extortionate price of course, but what price is too steep when we spend it for our peasants welfare?\n\nObviously the answer is any price but that's the way we'll spin it in the papers. Clearly we need to accommodate our frail workers with the latest in profit-multiplying equipment. This investment will be costly, but if it can finally bring our mines into the 20th century it'll all be worth it. We can save money on the safety equipment though.

Supplies will be gathered, the many miles of ribbon we have used in opening ceremonies will be recycled, we will send our diplomats to secure celebrities and dignitaries from across the sphere to act as guest of honour.\n\nLet the roads throng with our peasants, let their bellies and their pockets be filled! Let every friend of the government give thanks and drink deep. This day will be a celebration for everyone.

Now the fire spreads and rises and roars through forest and valley and mountain. Xinan shall burn with Long Yun's righteous fire. China shall burn. The sphere shall burn. All shall burn.\n\n Xinan was never a great state. It was idle and weak, lazy and degenerate. It bowed before Japan, debasing itself rather than die with dignity. It offered up its riches, the very lifeblood of it's earth, to grasping Zaibatus and Keiretsu, rather than use that wealth to spray the guts of the salaryman to the four winds. It sided with the so-called 'Reorganised Government' of traitors and bootlicking Hanjian scum, rather than to kill the false Chinese and keep China pure! But most wretchedly of all it did not even have the strength to kill Long Yun when it had the chance and by hell or high-water no-one shall ever have that chance again! Until the dying breath of the last true Chinese we will fight, we will kill, we will win. There is no alternative.

From this day forward our slavish obsession with exports ends. The factories of Nanjing and Tokyo shall grow cold in their idleness, fitting mausoleums for dreams that should have long since died. The factories of Kunming shall spin, and roar, and scream out their fury at a Heaven and Earth which turned its back on them. Pillars of smoke shall hold up the sky. Mountains of ash shall keep down the Earth. We shall become the mill which rips the chaff from the wheat of China. Xinan was a land of sweat, slaves and slavers.

Their folly was relying on stone.\n\nStone cannot will, it cannot push itself beyond its limitations, it cannot strive or struggle. It sits, inert and soulless, upon the Earth. Fortification is a fool's errand, an ancient conceit. Modern problems require modern solutions. Flesh and blood will crush the invader. Garrisons, human waves, cities in arms. The defences of China will not rely on fallible stone or earth, but on the unbreakable will and indomitable spirit of her people."

All things considered we showed considerable restraint in our liberation of China from Hanjian rule, and our soldiers come from the poorest and most destitute backgrounds in all the sphere.

China, as a whole, undivided and united behind a strong leader, didn't lose. It has never lost. China needs to be truly one country, not a group of nations or a federation or a nation with regional autonomies, but a singular, solid unitary nation.

Moreover, we could convince Burma to carry a part of the Project's costs, lessening the short-term financial impact of the endeavour. However, Burma is not the richest state inside the Sphere - if we want to convince them of our idea, we must be willing to offer some incentives and investments ourselves."
