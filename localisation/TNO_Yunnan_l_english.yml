#POLITICS_LU_HAN_DESC_1_OLD:0 "루한은 집행관이자 남방의 영웅, 그리고 국민적 자부심의 수호자입니다. 사람들은 지주들로부터 농민을 해방시킨 사람을 숭배하는 법을 배웠기 때문에, 이러한 많은 별명들이 매일 정부 센터, 학교, 기업, 그리고 윈난의 상점들에도 울려 퍼집니다.\n\n물론, 그는 그러한 일들은 결코 한적이 없습니다. 농민들은 여전히 노예이고, 마을은 여전히 가난하며, 국가적 자부심은 여전히 엉망진창이고, 나라는 범죄로 가득 차 있습니다. 루의 통치 아래에선 이런것들이 전혀 바뀔 것 같아 보이지 않습니다."
POLITICS_LU_HAN_DESC_2:0 "윈난의 상황을 조금이라도 이해하는 사람이라면 그 머나먼 지역을 다스리는 루한 장군의 복잡한 유산을 알 수 있을것입니다.\n\n이족인 그는 1895년 자오퉁에서 태어났습니다. 어려서부터 그는 군사학을 공부했고 그의 사촌인 룽윈과 혈연으로 가까운 관계였습니다. 세월이 흘러 일본 제국주의가 침략해오자, 루한은 노련하고 교활하게 그의 고향을 지키기 위해 싸웠습니다. 하지만 그것은 충분하지 않았습니다. 루한에게 매우 슬프고 고통스럽게도 일본인들이 밀고들어왔고, 그들의 진격으로 인해 그의 사랑하는 사촌은 겨우 2인자로 물러나고 윈난 성장의 자리를 루한에게 넘겨줄 수밖에 없었습니다. 그 이후로, 그는 그의 사람들을 보호하기 위해 최선을 다할 수밖에 없었습니다.\n\n동정적인 사람과 반체제 인사들은 중국 남서부 즉 시난을 괴롭히는 다양한 도적과 반란군을 상대하는 그의 방법론을 비난할 수도 있습니다. 루한은 마음속으로 그들이 옳다는 것을 인정하지만, 그에겐 선택권이 없습니다. 아무리 양심이 그를 산 채로 잡아먹겠다고 위협해도 그는 그것을 해야만 합니다.\n\n자신의 안전과 고향의 안전을 위해서, 그리고 고향땅 사람들의 안녕을 위해서라도 그는 자신의 가치관을 되돌려야 합니다. 반제국주의는 이제 아무 의미가 없습니다. 중요한 것은 생존, 논란, 더러운 불명예입니다."
#POLITICS_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "룽윈은 과거의 유령입니다. 한때 운남성의 군벌이었던 그는, 그를 감금하고, 고문하고, 그의 아들을 죽이고, 운남을 일본에 항복시키고 룽윈을 뒤틀린 죄책감과 연민으로 살려둔 그의 사촌 루한에게 배신당했습니다.\n\n이 경험들은 룽윈을 변화시켰습니다. 어찌 그러지 않을 수 있겠습니까? 그의 마음은 망가졌습니다,혹은 그의 인생에서 처음으로 바르게 생각하게 된 것일지도 모르지요. 그는 중국이 어떤지 보았습니다: 부패한, 비겁함과 수치심으로 오염된 잿빛 땅. 그러나 그는 또한 새로운 중국을 보았으며, 과거에서 새로 태어나기 위해 투쟁하고 있습니다.\n\n룽윈은 그가 중국을 검고 빛나는 미래로 이끌 것을 압니다. 그의 지도하에, 부역자들은 유황굴에 던져질것이고, 일본인들은 에덴 동산에서 쫒겨날것이고, 나팔소리에 소환된 기수들은 중국을 새 시대로 안내할 것입니다.\n\n중국은 반드시 자유로워질것 입니다, 비록 세계의 나머지 부분이 불탈지라도."

POLITICS_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "남송의 위대한 악비는 등에 "진충보국" 이라는 문신을 새겼다고 합니다. 그의 이야기는 비극적입니다. 그는 충실히 그의 주군을 지지했지만, 제국은 그에게 죽음으로 보답했습니다. 수 세기 후, 신해혁명의 여파로, 그는 외세 제국주의에 대한 저항사상의 기반이 되었습니다. 혁명의 여파에서 영향받은 많은 젊은이들과 마찬가지로 룽윈은 그를 충성과 경건함, 그리고 무엇보다도 이 시기에 나라를 위해 봉사하기 위해 자신의 존재를 초월한 강대한 침략자에 대한 끊임없는 투쟁의 귀감으로 여겼습니다.\n\n윈난 성장으로 재직하기 전, 악비의 전설은 그를 탕지야오의 군대에 입대하게 만들었습니다. 그는 말단 일병에서 군단장까지 승진했습니다. 그리고 나서, 그는 탕지야오에 대항해 쿠데타를 일으켰고, 부패하고 권력에 굶주린 통치자의 손아귀에서 지방을 되찾았습니다. 일본이 쳐들어오자, 룽윈은 군대를 일으켜 전선으로 향했습니다. 그의 지방을 통해 국민당의 생명줄인 버마 로드가 운영되어 중국을 계속 싸우게 했습니다.\n\n그리하여 그렇게 많은 중국의 젊은이들이 중일전쟁에서 행진하고 싸웠던 것은 바로 이러한 저항 정신이었습니다. 그들이 공산당이든 국민당이든 그것은 별로 중요하지 않았습니다. 흘려진 피는 일본에게 항복하지 않았던 한 나라의 기억, 그들만의 결속력을 형성했습니다. 룽윈은 수천 명의 사람들이 기관총 앞에 목숨을 잃고 포탄에 맞아 쓰러져가는 것을 지켜봤지만, 그렇지만 중국은 항복하지 않았습니다. 장제스는 충칭으로 후퇴했고 그곳에서 최후까지 결사항전했습니다. 그는 도시를 지키다가 전사했고 퇴각하는 과정에서 국부군은 사방으로 흩어졌지만, 중국은 항복하지 않았습니다.\n\n그 주인의 천쪼가리를 걸친 난징 정부는 스스로를 전 중국의 통치자라고 착각하고 있습니다. 그들은 틀렸습니다. 악비의 죽음은 외국의 지배자들에게 예속된 중국의 가장 어두운 날들의 시작을 의미했을지도 모릅니다. 하지만, 룽윈과 국민혁명군은 그 투쟁의 횃불을 들고, 황금빛 새벽을 향해 그 어느때보다 빠르게 달려나갈 것입니다."

POLITICS_ZHOU_LONGXIANG_DESC:0 "저우룽샹은 수십 년 동안 중국 협력정부의 대의를 위해 봉사해 왔습니다. 식민주의와 제국주의로부터 자유로워진 일본의 대동아의 꿈을 꾼 가오쭝우가 그들에게 전향하여 왕징웨이를 도와 국민정부를 구성할 때, 저우룽샹은 그와 함께 일본 제국으로 전향하는 중국인의 첫 핵심 인원이었습니다. 그 자리에서 조국이 예속된 동안 몇 년 동안 국민정부와 국민당을 조직하고 일본 주인의 의지, 정확히는 변덕에 부응하기 위해 할 수 있는 모든 것을 다했습니다.\n\n가오쭝우가 몇 년 전에 깨달았어야 했던 것을 마침내 깨달았을 때, 공영권과 서양의 영향력 제거에 대한 모든 용감한 이야기는 일본 제국주의를 위한 터뤄이 무마 즉 트로이 목마에 불과하다는 것을 깨달았을 때, 저우룽샹은 분노와 실망으로 가오쭝우와 함께 했습니다. 그리고 나서 그는 일본에 대한 이전의 열정을 버리고 대신 중국을 종속시켰던 최근의 불평등 조약과 그것을 시행한 뻔뻔한 신식민주의자들을 약화시켰습니다.\n\n수십 년 동안 그의 총통과 함께 불침번을 서온 저우룽샹은 이제 그로부터 어려운 임무를 맡겨졌습니다. 이제 서부 반란이 진압되었으니, 고대 중국 고전에서 나온 야만적인 폭군에 의해 폐허가 되고, 메시아적 컴플렉스에 사로잡힌 분노에 미친 쓰라린 광인, 광란의 독재자 룽윈이 남긴 피비린내 나는 난장판을 치우고 파괴된 시난 땅에 약간의 평화, 질서, 치유를 가져와야 합니다.\n\n저우룽샹은 그 일이 그에게 적합하다는 것을 꽤 잘 알고 있습니다."

POLITICS_NPA_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "마지막 저항이 실패했습니다. 중국의 위대한 해방가 룽윈이 죽었습니다. 서남왕이 다사다난한 중국 역사의 기록이 되며 호국군 잔당은 머리가 사라진 채로 맞섭니다. 일부는 절망 속에서 세상을 뜬 장군의 해방이라는 꿈에 매달리고 있지만 룽윈의 치세에서 해방된 다른 이들은 이미 항복했거나 남서부 산맥으로 사라졌습니다."

POLITICS_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "중국 도시와 평야 곳곳의 많은 사람들의 가슴 속에는 신해혁명의 기억이 밝게 타오르고, 억압과 자유의 이야기가 전해지며, 이는 국가를 기념하는 승리의 찬가입니다. 이 빛은 아마도 쑨원의 아들인 쑨커에 의해 가장 밝게 전달될 것입니다.\n\n그의 아버지가 추구한 것과 비슷하게, 쑨커는 어린 나이에 책과 책을 찾아헤맸고, 서양과 중국 작가들 모두에 몰두했으며, 미국에서 공부한 뒤 그것들을 가지고 왔습니다. 쑨커가 본토로 돌아오는 배에 탔을때쯤, 중국은 혁명의 칼데라에 휩싸여있었고, 그는 중국내전의 판 위에 놓인 또 다른 장기말, 광저우 시장이 되었습니다. 그는 일본의 맹공이 중국의 언덕과 강을 휩쓸고 지나가는 것을 지켜보며 장제스에 반대했습니다.\n\n마침내 전차가 뒤집혔을 때, 그는 그가 그토록 몸바쳤던 땅을 떠나 젊은 시절 열망에 찬채 도착했던 미국으로 돌아왔습니다.\n\n수십 년이 흐른 후, 쑨커는 일본이 그의 조국을 알아볼 수 없는 조각들로 찢어버리고, 그의 아버지가 오랜 세월 동안 싸워온 무언가임을 가장하는 수치스러운 정부를 세우는 것을 지켜봤습니다. 하지만, 그는 동쪽에서 해가 뜨는 것을 지켜보았고, 호국군이 그의 투쟁의 유산을 되찾아주었기에, 마침내 숨을 내쉴 수 있었고, 다시 한번 중국 땅을 동경할 수 있었습니다. 그의 삶의 이 시점에서, 그는 그의 집무실에서 끝없는 지평선을 바라보며 그 아래 거리의 불협화음을 듣고 싶을 뿐입니다. 그는 자신이 이타심 때문에 돌아온 것이 아니라는 것을 확실히 알고 있지만, 그의 동포들에게 둘러싸여 집으로 돌아올 수 있다면 그것으로 충분할 것입니다."

POLITICS_HE_YINGQIN_JAP_DESC:0 "한때 국민당의 장군이자 장제스의 동맹이었던 허잉친은 이제까지 일본에 저항한 모든 이들이 맞게된 운명을 이미 목격했고, 이제 가능한 한 권력을 유지하고 증대시키기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. 시난 반란의 시작을 몰래 허용하고 심지어 방조한 그의 행동의 교묘함은 아무도 그의 행동의 의도를 깨닫지 못하게 했으며, 때마침 일본과 협력하기로 한 또 다른 협정을 통해 그는 모든 경쟁자들이 몰락하거나 도망친 상태에서 서남부 지역의 궁극적인 권력자로 등극했습니다. 그의 새로운 지위는 그와 모든 중국인들이 장제스 아래 경험했던 영광스러운 날들에 비하면 여전히 희미하지만, 장제스 시대의 너무 많은 타락한 동료들이 증명하는, 많은 것들이 달라졌더라면 그가 맞게되었을지도 모르는 것보다는 훨씬 더 나은 운명입니다. 그럴만한 가치가 있었을까요? 오직 시간만이 말해줄 것입니다."

From the National Revolutionary Army making pushes for the long-dead republicanism of Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, the masses of bandits robbing government assets, the remnants of the Chinese Communist Party along the Vietnamese border, and the NPA fighting under the banner of nationalism, Lu Han has his work cut out for him.\n\nAssuming we have enough resources and enough time, we will find no trouble in eliminating these insurgents. Even still, we have no reason not to make a heavy push against these resistance movements, and to ensure that all of Xinan is integrated into Yunnan as soon as possible."

These operations were initially believed to be low-level crime and robbery, though it is now clear as to just how extensive these insurgents are within Yunnan. After some preliminary reports against the organization, it is clear as to just how powerful the NRA has become, and how much of a threat it stands to become against Lu Han's government.\n\nThanks to their connections within Burma and low-level government officials, not to mention currying the favor of countless landlords, the NRA partisans have become the most influential leaders of the black market, and stand to become strong enough to rise up and cause serious trouble for Lu Han. If we strike now, however, we will be strangling this insurgency in the crib, and we will certainly manage to survive this horrible ordeal. Perhaps the biggest external threat to the regime."

#Long Yun
#Hatred is humanity's finest weapon, a lesson the Axis imposed to the world at large, and one that Long Yun has taken not only to his heart but to his gaze, posture, and words. The collaborators and the traitors stole of him everything of worth, but what he weeps most is not what he lost, but what his beloved nation lost; her pride, her people and her history have been cast into oblivion. An entire generation was raised to bow upon the Rising Sun in fear -- to leech off their home's bounty and sell to foreigners their dignity for mere scraps.nWith the National Protection Army under his umbrella, the lesson Japan carved in his soul will echo like a drum as the army marches on.\n\nAnd upon the Begonia Leaf, Long Yun hopes to carve a second lesson to be seen by the world at large: That China will not bow to the order that Japan and their ilk imposed upon the world, that her sons and daughters will be avenged, and that, by trial, blood, tears and fury, they will be free.

A serene little state, picturesque and mountainous, covered in dense forests that buzz with every variety of life.\n\nWatching over the peasant who tills the fields, who works the mines and carries tremendous weight on their backs, is Lu Han, having inherited Yunnan's position of supreme authority from his cousin Long Yun more than decade ago. Within Yunnan are the Yi people, a minority who owns most of the land in Yunnan and of whom Lu Han is now their undisputed leader; outside of Yunnan the Yunnan clique answers only to the Nanjing Nationalist Government, China's sole legitimate sovereign - with "slight" autonomy granted in return to boot. By maintaining this balance between the wealthy privileged elite at home and his brethren and superiors just across China's mountains and rivers, Lu Han ensures his own, and by extension Yunnan's, safety and security.\n\nDespite being what the unkind and foolish may label a "warlord" Lu Han has very little interest in warring. True, those bandits skirting our borders - NRA elements, communists, those ghosts of the past haunting our serenity - they are a thorn to our side, but they amount to little more than a trifling distraction, for Lu has a mandate to keep, a greater good to contribute to. For at this very moment the Republic's Five Modernizations roar the heavens and inject our motherland with inexhaustible industrial vitality, and to their righteous cause we selflessly devote Yunnan's soil and the wealth within. We extract, we sell. We harvest, we sell. Let us provide the firmament, under which our mighty brethren shall twist the raw material of nature into the wonders of civilization.\n\nWe must not, and we cannot, forget our place.

Tin is one of our biggest exports already and building up our raw material extraction can only bring good things into this great state. Mineral wealth is the wealth of kings, it is the wealth of the gods and it shall be the wealth of Yunnan.\n\nWe were fully prepared to seize it from its current owners when we were pleasantly surprised to learn that the site already belongs to the government, we must merely decide what to do with it.\n\nBefore we sign off on this decision we need to address a letter we have received from the Kunming Antiquarian Society begging us to give them just a few more days to remove everything of historical significance from the site."

Lu Han had spent the morning looking over the small mountain of reports on the growing resistance within Yunnan, and to say that even the sheer amount of reports was concerning would be inadequate, let alone what the reports themselves entailed.\n\n"In short, sir, there are roughly four separate insurgencies within Yunnan as of this moment, namely the bandits of the southwest, who are currently isolating themselves within the mountainous terrain, which have proved a substantial challenge to law enforcement efforts, there are the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army fighting within the Burma Road, which has caused some... trouble with transportation, there are the Chinese Communist Party fighting within the rural regions, and that's all to say nothing of the so-called "호국군" movement within our own armed forces, fomenting their nationalism and revanchism, as you know." Lu Han nodded, and stood up from his desk, walking towards the glorified accountant of Chen.\n\n"Now, Chen, what would you recommend that I do about these insurgents? It seems we have enemies around every corner, in... every facet of our government. We cannot stand with this... subversion, tearing us apart from the inside. Now then, what do you say that I do about it?" Chen stood quiet for a moment, thinking as to what he should say.\n\n"...Root them out, sir?" Lu Han smiled.\n\n"Exactly.

What remains of the NRA had rarely had a moment to breathe since evacuating however it could - it just so happened that Zhao's cell had been hiding within north Burma, right alongside what remained of the Burma Road. Since 1937, Zhao had spent his time fighting for China's freedom, from Wuhan to Chongqing, and finally to where he sat now. In his cot, in the ad-hoc training camp which had been bringing in young men and pumping out soldiers. For that, Zhao could blame few other than himself.\n\n"Zhao, fresh batch coming in, thirty minutes." A face had half-peaked into the tent. Letting out a sigh, Zhao heaved himself off of his bedside and was hit with the overwhelming realization of why he was training, and not the one raiding the Burma Road. Of course, all could do their part for China, one way or another, and Zhao would not stop until China was free, one way or another.\n\nStepping out in front of the disorganized line of confused volunteers, they still seemed to be taking in the camp, until they noticed Zhao and his chest of iron medals, marching towards the chattering collection of young men. By the time Zhao had walked up to the end of the line, the crowd had completely silenced. Thinking to his speech, Zhao began to walk down the aisle.\n\n"Now, it has come to my attention, gentlemen, that you all hope to liberate China. Liberate it of Japanese influence, liberate it of its authoritarianism. You all hope to bring liberation to China, and you have joined us in our war against the collaborators to the rats in Japan.

Every other day, it seemed the very fabric of China shifted,  and today was no different. Today, the decision was made by NRA high-command - which apparently existed - to expand operations across Burma and into Yunnan. To facilitate this, making use of the excessive troops pouring in from Yunnan proved far from enough, and all hands were called on deck. It just so happened that Zhao found himself with a pair of those hands, and enough experience in the '40s to get caught with the rank of officer. It was more or less a ceremonial role, however, as officers had rarely engaged in active combat, and all orders had come in from the generals and high-command which had just come out of mothballs. Why his unit was being assigned to the biggest raid on the Burma Road since 1947, then, came as something of a surprise to him.\n\nLaying in the trees alongside a half dozen of his former trainees, it seemed as though they'd forgotten about spacing. It didn't really bother Zhao - he couldn't be bothered to be bothered, frankly. Besides, so far as Zhao could tell, it wasn't even close. Between the two militias to fight for him, he would prefer his own a thousand to one. That was also an accurate statistic, which was also mildly concerning. A rumbling began to grow over the roads ahead of them, snapping Zhao out of his cloud of thoughts. They could already see it. A small convoy of trucks, two APCs, and a line of what seemed to be heavily armed refugees. Otherwise known as Yunnan's best and brightest.\n\n"Alright. You boys ready?"

Had it not been for the constant reassurances from the guide who hardly spoke a lick of Chinese, Li would have completely fallen to despair, though with every step deeper and deeper into the Vietnamese jungle, Li's faith faded further.\n\nStopping in the middle of a small clearing of brush, the guide whose name had slipped Li's mind had begun tapping away at the ground with his foot. Looking around himself, Li felt like this was it. Lu Han had found a way to get his hands around Vietnam, and Li's life was about to be snuffed out by an ambush in who-knows-where, Vietnam. It was then that the ground had flung open, and a hole had opened up on the jungle floor. At first, Li stood in absolute astonishment, as the rest of his troupe gathered around him, and watched on in horror as their guide squeezed into the ground, waving his hand for the trio to enter the hole, before submerging completely.\n\n"What the fuck?!" The three looked around at one another before Li took a step forward.\n\n"Li, that seems like a fucking horrible idea, no offense."

Walking through the dirt intersection of what could technically be a market, and the beginning of a long path of farms, Li took a moment to appreciate the humid air of the rice paddies. Walking alongside his pair of comrades, Li couldn't really do much else but appreciate the boredom. After all, there was little to do beyond keeping an eye out for Yunnan's soldiers, and it was always nice to see people waving to him when passing by. It wasn't like the CCP was wanting for popularity within the rural regions, of course. The occasional landlords which still dotted the rural regions within the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party were more than enough to keep the necessity of patrols alive and well, not to mention the infrequent checkup patrols from Lu Han's own forces, irredeemably poorly equipped as they were.\n\nThe trio made their way to the end of the dirt road, having long finished their rounds with the farms. Li always enjoyed talking with the people, even if it was born out of necessity and habit. Hearing the stories of the landlords, how different things used to be, it was always interesting to hear of what the world used to look like before he made a difference. Walking down the dirt road, words with the people always made for good food for thought. As the village receded from sight, and the clamor of the woods rose in tune, Li's thoughts returned to that of a good soldier. His attention turned back to the noises around him.

The most recent addition to the ranks of these bandits, however, was a man named Huang.\n\nBy midnight, the moon was up, and the last bites of food had been eaten. All that was left for the rest of the night were the stories. For lack of alternatives, Huang had taken the metaphorical stage.\n\n"Well, Huang, how'd you wind up here?" The smiles were still lingering around the fire, and many were beginning to want to call it a night. The man in question was young, no older than twenty-five, and had the face and posture of a hungry man, but had certainly anything but the body of a starving man.\n\n"Well, I came here from northern Yunnan, actually. There... the landlords, they and Lu Han's thugs, they all did whatever they wanted. My family, you see, they weren't rich folks. Just farmers. One day, my mom got sick, we thought it was typhoid. We worked to keep her healthy, traded with the closest we had to a pharmacist. We traded plenty of what we had for medication. We didn't make rent."\n\nThe circle grew quiet. All that could be heard was the crackling of the flames. "They came for our crops first. There wasn't anything which we had left, we'd already given them everything we had, you know. They still came. They set it all alight. There wasn't much left by then, but they still called it a warning and expected us to pay the next week. Obviously, we all knew we couldn't, and they definitely knew, too.

If there proved no alternative, then it was morally correct. So Huang reminded himself, as he looked over the village ahead of him.\n\nIt was an insulting sight, a dozen or so of Yunnan's army, already greatly concerning. Even more concerning was the army of citizens fortifying the center intersection. If the people had cooperated with the army of Yunnan, then Huang's gang had been raiding far too frequently. Something to note for later. How Huang's gang of similarly trained bandits would beat back government forces consisting of twice their size was a harrowing thought, barely reassured by his allies around him.\n\n"No, it will work out, we have the element of surprise, this'll work." It didn't even sound like the bandit had believed it, let alone convinced the rest of the thieves.\n\n"Anyone got any ideas?" Huang asked the collection of bandits, himself among them. The village was well defended, and it became clear that the citizens may have very well been among the village defenders.\n\n"No, no, the gunfire from that farmhouse there." The bandits had continued to debate the best course of action. From the looks of it, things weren't looking up.\n\n"We could always- no, hold on, nevermind."

Zeng Zesheng and An Enpu were both invaluable assets to Yunnan - the former in the army, and the latter in the civilian government.

A desk position, a nothing job would be more preferable. The only other figure that could then take up the mantle of leader would be his cousin by marriage, Lu Han.\n\nAnd so it happened that Lu Han ascended to the position of leader of Yunnan - not by the people's will, not by clever political machinations, not by force of arms. Simply as the only other option. At first it was difficult: managing reconstruction, fulfilling the Nanjing government and Tokyo's endless hunger for resources and men, exercising his duty while on constant watchout for assassins, malcontents, and the seemingly endless stream of traitors, defectors, and other useless delusionals still unaware that the war had ended and China, however bitter it may be, had lost. But, as with anything, slowly Lu Han grew to fit this new role. He learned of the many ways to get around Yunnan's endless deficiencies and weaknesses - the men lurking in the shadows with armies and treasuries behind them that could be enticed to support the government. The long peace corroded both his inner spirit and his naivete, and produced a statesmen with sharp eyes and sharper ears - the nationalist fervour that once burned so brightly now smoulders away quietly. Perhaps it may never reignite - or perhaps it may..\n\nNevertheless, Lu Han now sits at the top of a precarious corpse of power, held aloft by myriad promises to landlords and the wealthy, continued assurances of fealty to the Nanjing regime in exchange for autonomy, and above all the disorganization of all the groups that could potentially unseat him.

A nothing job, the sole purpose of which is to legitimize an administration that betrays every principle he has ever had - led by his cousin, a man more palatable as the leader of Yunnan to the Japanese forces.\n\nIt was not always like this. There was once a time all the nation was ablaze with righteous fury against the Japanese invader; when he knew who was friend and who was foe, and the peasants knew there was a leader who stood for them. But those days are long past, and now those peasants are ground to dust systematically under the boot of Japan's lapdogs with no voice of complaint allowed to issue from them. The fire and fury of the war have been replaced with dead-eyed resignation, from the shattered villages populated solely by women who still hang pictures on the walls of their missing halves, to the mines and farms that rip the green earth's bounty from the soil to be shipped off to the sea - far, far away from Yunnan - to the cities littered with veterans who lost their limbs fighting against the men who now dictate their very existence a nuisance to 'public order'. Everywhere Long Yun looks, all he can see is the bitter legacy of a lost war.\n\nIt cannot continue like this. Even with the spies and turncoats listening at every corner, whispers travel of men with arms who still believe in the old ways, who still believe in the sanctity of Justice, and who still remember the time he, Long Yun, led them against the despicable invader. A quiet flame still burns in Xinan, and if the traitors in Nanjing and the devils in Tokyo refuse to hear the cries of his people, there always remains the option to light with it the torch of revolt.\n\nOnce upon a time, it was fire that burned away the locusts that threatened to feast on Yunnan's bosom."

The idea of challenging authority itself had become associated with the brutal reprisals that inevitably came after, the intentional deprivations and starving of families that had already only scraped by day after day. Most of those men willing to fight have now vanished into the forests and mountains, having joined some group or other waiting for their opportunity.\n\nThose men now bide their time huddled around fires remembering the days when tyranny was overthrown (even if only for a while) and the dreams of the masses rose as high as the embers that lit their faces. The Taiping Rebellion, the Xinhai Revolution - even if one movement failed, others eventually succeeded, and if one man died, a hundred would take his place. Policemen visiting the villages and towns see only the defeated faces they are presented with, hear only the stories of resignation and surrender. And it is true, there are few left there that would act in defiance themselves.\n\nBut the simmering rage of hundreds of lost sons, thousands of lost kin, and millions of lost countrymen does not easily dissipate even with the decades passed.

This year the relief of a good celebration was needed more sorely than ever, and so the full resources of the state were devoted to a festival more stunning and lavish than any that had ever been held in Yunnan. It was also a good excuse to send to the remotest parts of the country those 'government functionaries' that were really just the Nanjing regime's eyes and ears, and escape to Zhaotong where the loyalty of the local people was guaranteed. This was their homeland and hometown, and no bigwig from any other part of the world would be honored over the local heroes who had earned such distinction in the war. Regardless of what some had done after.\n\nFinally the moment came.

But the words had hit him deep, and in his heart of hearts he could not help but agree. Nothing showed to Long Yun, however, and his hopefulness at getting Lu Han to understand soon began to wither.

When he and his cousin submitted to the sharpened blades of the Japanese, they did so for the good of their people, so how could so many of his countrymen fail to see as such? Why would he forever be plagued with insurgency after insurgency, compromise after compromise, just to keep his domain afloat?\n\nHe took a deep breath, the tea calming his senses. He did not like the current order of affairs, his citizens certainly did not like them, but his options were limited. In order to protect Yunnan, it was either the bayonet or the pen, one of the options was untenable, and so, he could only slave away under the omnipresent gaze of his former enemies.\n\nLu Han carried the wooden tray away from the pavilion, he had more business to contend with."

Another development project was undertaken by President Gao Zongwu of the Republic of China, a nation he is still technically a part of. Ever since his ascension, Lu Han had always had mixed opinions about President Gao, a man who held so much promise and opportunity for China and its populace, championing a term that had been referenced and spoken of uncountable times within the borders of his homeland: modernization.\n\nA concept that has been in the center of Chinese administration since the waning days of the forlorn Qing Dynasty, a notion demanded by the students of May 4th, a dream proclaimed loudly by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, but alas, the rays of hope were eventually eclipsed by the rising sun. Even as China was trampled by the jackboot of the Japanese dogs, modernization still remained as prevalent as ever. Would modernization not be the route to which China could shatter the fetters which bound it, awaken the slumbering giant and brush off the domination of Japan once and for all? He certainly believed so.\n\nPerhaps he would be more amenable to the President, perhaps he was the key to end our sorrows. Sure, his people might have to endure through periods of hardship, but that is not anything unfamiliar or new, the long-term benefits would outweigh any price.\n\nHe stood still, frozen in place as he contemplated this dilemma. A few minutes later, his psyche had been cleared. Perhaps the President would need some resources."

Perhaps, the lack of true leaders. The Yunnanese soldier of today fights for no higher ideals than his next paycheck, and the Yunnanese general does not even fight - he spends his days gleefully savouring the pleasures of this life with no concern for such mundane concepts as 'service' or 'duty'.\n\nIt also certainly does not help that both Tokyo and Nanjing take an extremely dim view of arming the peripheral Chinese states any more than the bare minimum - with next to nothing for a police force or an armed guard, the army must fulfil all these roles with a fraction of the materiel or manpower needed. The average soldier finds himself extorting poor peasants incapable of paying their taxes, shooting at unarmed 'partisans' whose only crime was attempting to survive in a state that made no room for them, and after a long day of such actions, listening to broadcast after broadcast extolling the virtues of Pan-Asian cooperation and the New World Order that China finds herself in.\n\nWith their leader and commander-in-chief in such a pathetic state, it is no wonder the common soldiery feel no loyalty to their cause and no comradeship with their past. Lu Han's army continues to atrophy and rot, and one must wonder - is there any hope for the spirit of the glorious NRA 60th Corps to return?"

Long Yun also knew perfectly well that he was in no position to do anything at all - with no men and no movement Japan's weakness could offer a million opportunities without a single one of them ending up useful. Sitting at his desk alone in the late evening, he considered slowly and carefully all his options.\n\nEven after twenty years of kowtowing and licking the Japanese's boots, the Reorganized Republic still lacked their trust. They were all traitors both to their comrades and their countries, and though the Japanese were the one who installed them in power they knew well the dangers of trusting a band of turncoats. The Reorganized Republic was allowed some fifty thousand men for its own self-preservation, and that was it. Yunnan's army, on its own, numbered nearly enough to trounce them if it was used properly! Lu Han could, at this moment, cement his name in Chinese history as a champion of the people if only he...\n\nBut it was pointless to dwell on if onlys and what ifs. It was possible that his cousin would wake up to his senses and remember his duty - his honor as a Yi. It was also possible - and unfortunately, probable - that he would remain blinded by the idea of serving the Nanjing government, and more... drastic actions would have to be taken. One thing was sure, however.\n\nJapan's New World Order was collapsing around its feet, and sooner or later, someone would have to take the opportunity."

Yingqin has a large and influential band of associates, and taking them out of the picture will isolate and significantly reduce Yingqin's power. To accomplish this, we've laid out three options: we could bribe all of his associates to sway their power away from Yingqin, but this will be quite costly upon our coffers as loyalty costs more for some than others.

He cleared his throat, then spoke, and he did not stop speaking for some time. His focus shifted from the opening of new mines to advancing methods of agricultural production and even to prioritizing the region's lackluster industry. Ultimately he pressed the absolute necessity of economic modernization, nothing could block this and every sacrifice was necessary.\n\nThough he had never fooled himself into believing he was by any means a magnificent orator, Lu Han was nevertheless dismayed by the lack of a reaction.

He could not be seen to be avoiding the countryside. Such was an invitation only to more unrest. More dissent. Besides, his presence also ensured that the bureaucrats dispatched performed their functions to the best of their abilities, rather than to that which was minimum acceptable.\n\nSo Lu Han's bodyguards surrounded him, and he proceeded from camp to camp, town to town, and village to village, making sure the people knew who was in command. It was near the end of the trip, when he thought the threat of violence past, that the assassin made his move.\n\nHe had positioned himself masterfully, exploiting a blind corner to avoid the gaze of security staff. He had crossed the open space in the blink of an eye, and aimed his weapon masterfully, straight at Lu Han's heart. He had pulled the trigger.\n\nThe weapon did not fire.\n\nAn instant later, the assassin had been buried under bodyguards and soldiers, beaten into unconsciousness, and securely tied for transport to prison.

Many had said it could not be done, that the mountainous countryside of Yunnan would always offer scant agricultural bounty, even if the exact opposite was true of its minerals. But new technologies, new techniques, and new efforts had proved them wrong, and the state was seeing its granaries becoming ever more full.\n\nThe only negative he could see in this expansion were the reports of gradually intensifying banditry, claimed by some to be formed by gangs of displaced peasants. Others, however, suggested - more darkly - that the equipment, tactics, discipline, and above all zeal, displayed by these so called bandits hinted at alternative identity. Nationalists or, even worse, Communists.\n\nThe Minister refused these characterizations. A short-term eruption of disorder was understandable, given how radically land usage was being changed. But an insurgency was not. It could not be so. That would invite too many questions, and too much scrutiny.\n\nNo. The reports would be clear. They were bandits."

This is what had motivated his offer, and what had brought these powerful men to his capital.\n\nThe trade proposed was simple, and out of respect for their station, Lu Han did not waste their time with empty platitudes. He focused on their greed, on their motivation for profit. He offered them the confluence of a large workforce, low cost of living, and proximity of raw materials available at very low prices. In return, they would invest into the state, developing its industry and injecting very needed hard currency into the economy.\n\nThe acceptance of this offer by the representatives was equally swift. They knew a deal when they saw it, and in Yunnan they saw a new frontier for rapacious exploitation and tremendous profit. They could not, would not, allow this opportunity to pass by, and so they did not.\n\nShaking Lu Han's hand, one by one, each of them smiled, and to the bureaucrats facilitating the meeting and making records of the pact, it was as if they were so many sharks."

He reported the vast injections of Japanese and Chinese capital which had driven an equally vast increase in the number of operating factories within the state.\n\nMost importantly, he reported on the enormous increase in unrest that had accompanied this increase, as foreign overseers immediately and overwhelmingly exploited their workforce, paying the least possible for the most work possible, with no care for safety. He reported on the fertile ground that had been offered for revolt.\n\nThe man from the CPC, a lifelong revolutionary, agreed.

His bosses - taskmasters carrying clipboards and pencils - have a new order for him every week: something new to assemble, different equipment and parts to produce. Specialization is a luxury such a rural manufactory cannot afford: instead, the workshop simply makes what is in demand from their few buyers - tools for the landlords and businesses to equip their own workers with, firearms and ammunition for the local authorities to fight bandits and thieves with, and machine parts for the cloaked men in false aliases, their use seemingly unknown. No questions are asked: not by Fan, not by any of his coworkers, and not by his overseers and the manager, not while the money keeps flowing.\n\nIt is a simple job, Fan's. He takes the pieces and parts bought from other such workshops or made by his colleagues, and fixes them together to create a finished - or at least more complete - product. Perhaps he should be thankful: he does not run the risk of burns from smithing and smelting, nor does he have to be careful not to have his arm amputated from a machining accident. Yet, he labors all day with no rest save a short lunch of mixian in lukewarm chicken broth, kept on his toes by the threat of replacement should he lapse in productivity. He collects his daily pittance of a wage long after dusk and makes the pilgrimage home - only offered the respite of a never-filling supper of rice and stale, boiled greens - the most he and his wife can afford.

Every day he woke up early in his shack, crammed alongside his wife, his children, and his parents. Every day, before the sun rose, he walked down a soot-choked dirt road past rundown farms and pollution-soaked rice fields and strange, bombed-out ruins. Every day, he found himself in a throng of other men and women marching toward the doors of a factory.\n\nWhat did he make? Was he good at his job? Did his work make life easier for people somewhere? He didn't know. He didn't care. His work had become specialized beyond reason, beyond meaning. Every day was the same day making the same small part, a metal coil, that was passed along a conveyor belt to other men like him wearing the same clothes, in the same conditions, living the same colorless lives. Their existences were endless toil, interrupted only by the occasional breakdown of the conveyor belt or maiming of some nameless, replaceable laborer.\n\nSometimes he would see rats scurrying along the floor, chewing on bits of amputated flesh. He wasn't sure if they were real. If they were, the men carrying clipboards on the catwalks did not notice.\n\nEvery few weeks, one of the men carrying a clipboard would give Ma his paycheck, a thin envelope with a few bills in it, a fraction of a fraction of the value of his labor. He would take it and trudge back from the factory, down the dirty, polluted road to his dilapidated home. He would press the envelope into his wife's hand, mumble an apology about it not being enough, about it never being enough, and then collapse on his bed.\n\nThen, after a night of dreamless sleep, he would wake up and the cycle would start anew."

The call had gone out weeks ago that the Party would be hosting a meeting, that they would be deciding on a plan of action for Yunnan's peasants and laborers to advance its plan of liberation. It fell on Hou Zhu, his sleeves rolled up, to deliver that plan. He stepped onto the stage and looked out onto the bodies.\n\n"Comrades, you have worked hard these last few months. The fruits of your labor are self-evident in every aspect of life. Already, the bosses and landlords are celebrating the increases in agricultural production."\n\nHou fell silent and watched as the union leaders murmured, wiping sweat off their brows. Beneath the pathetic whirring of the fans, he caught scattered complaints. The oppressors had been working them ragged and the ban on unions meant that there was no one to advocate for them. The people were chafing under the strain of the government's new regulations.\n\n"But we must be patient. The committee has decided that it is not yet time to strike. Even as the country grows restless, we must - "\n\nHou did not have the opportunity to finish his speech before the crowd began to roar in frustration.

You can tell us their names, right? Where those people might be right now?"\n\nThere were more tears, trembling. The boy mumbled something incoherent through his ruined, blood-filled mouth.

For the last few days, as part of some bullshit order given by some bullshit bureaucrat, he and hundreds of other prisoners had been deployed across the country to "rebuild China." While other prisoners were repairing bridges or building apartment blocks, he and his crew had been given explosives and told to flatten the valley to make way for some road. At least that was the idea.\n\n"Now, now," said Chao in a sweet, mocking voice. He gestured toward the rubble-strewn hill where several prisoners were again setting up explosives, getting ready to clear it. "We must salute these patriotic sons of China. It is only through their hard work that our countrymen can prosper." He leaned forward. "Because the fewer explosives on the black market, the more we can charge for it."\n\nThe crew erupted into laughter. While the morons across the valley were content on following orders, Chao and his crew saw little reason to help a government of traitors do anything. Better to pursue the far more lucrative business of selling to bandits, of helping them destroy convoys and launch robberies. At least the bandits were straight about their motives."

Worse, none of the guards seemed to care about Chao and his friends' regular trips out of the valley at night nor their regular, barely covert dips into supplies.\n\n"Took you long enough," said Chao as a man rode toward him on a horse.

Chao grabbed and thumbed through the packet, feeling its oil against his skin, before shoving it beneath his prisoner's uniform.\n\n"You'll find the normal supply of explosives and mining tools tucked in the crates alongside some small guns we got off some bandits a few weeks back after they raided a government warehouse," said Chao. "It won't be enough to demolish a government, but probably enough to cause some mayhem. Should I put you down for another shipment?"\n\nThe messenger nodded.

He had no allies save his client, and faced every enemy imaginable - the local authorities, bandits and criminals, at times rivals in the business, and even nature herself, with all her rugged mountains, befuddling woodlands, and treacherous cold nights. He had to travel alone or at best in a pair - numbers would draw attention and interception, and the KMT was strapped for men regardless. But that meant he was helpless against any desperate group of outlaws stalking the one or two roads which were in good enough shape for smuggling purposes. He had his pistol and ten years' experience, but that meant nothing to the raiders with rifles strapped to their backs and two decades of crime on their record.\n\nFortunately for the smuggler, life had gotten a little bit easier with the recent renovation and reopening of the old Burma Road. Where he had once had to drag and push his cargo through muddy paths whilst looking for and deftly avoiding bandit parties hidden behind the foliage on the wayside, he now had the luxury of an open paved road unplagued by ambushes - not to mention the far more direct connection meaning a shorter journey. The only downside, perhaps, was the increased police presence on the road - but they were thankfully too preoccupied hunting the raiders and tracking insurgents to notice the people supplying those insurgents. Besides, the government hadn't been that competent to crack down on corruption, so a good bribe could always solve any sticky situation.\n\nAll in all, the smuggler thought, everyone was made happy. The people were happy with the improved and safer road. The government was happy with the economic growth it brought. He was happy with his job being made a bit less difficult.

The officers held their breath and started saluting the master, so he started speaking.\n\n"Proud boys of our army, I have heard a lot of rumors surrounding us about an insurgency, a resistance going around in our lands, as we believe, they are nothing but lies to create chaos in our army, but still, I assure you to be mindful of any troubles, In a case of something critical, I want you to report them directly to me." Master Lu said, against a crowd staring at him with full focus and distrustful faces.\n\n"Oh, drop your cold approach, one of the reasons I have called each of you here today is to award your deeds to Yunnan," said Lu Han with a smirk, made a move to call his servants to bring a case full of medals and started awarding them to the officers. They had not been expecting this, but were really joyful about the situation.\n\nThe crowd of officers started applauding Master Lu, with the awarding ceremony over, he asked officers to move to a table with a map on it and began to draw lines to give the best officers a piece of land to own, with many other gifts such as giving them an increase on their salaries.

"And I am willing to allocate more funding to your province should you succeed in delivering results."\n\nLu Han thinly smiled to himself. "Ah, thank you. But we also need funding in order to continue development - and the landlords and companies which are overseeing the mineral boom need capital for their ventures, too. To earn money, we must first spend it. Of course, if you were so generous to give Xinan a chance, well, I would be deeply gracious, no?"\n\nGao curtly chuckled.

In attendance were several of his ministers, a gaggle of warlords and landlords from across the province, and even some businessmen - representatives of companies that lay across the border in China. They were all gathered in celebration of Xinan's revival, a miracle in the southwest proving that the province can stand, not as some glorified fiefdom afforded independence by Nanjing, but on its own two feet as a proper part of the Sphere. An event that Lu was sure to commemorate.\n\nWandering away from the bustle of the party with drink in hand to take in the night air for a moment, Lu Han couldn't help but look back on the assembled men and smile self-assuredly. Xinan had become what it was meant to be due to the system of men like them: A powerhouse that was fully realised of it's own worth and capabilities, and one that Japan would learn to rely on. Lu Han was Master of the Southwest, and he wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. Truly, what did he have to fear from his "enemies" nowadays, the ragged remains of the NRA in the hills? Certainly, they will have fallen far too low to be anything more than a pack of roving dogs.  The idea almost made Lu Han laugh.\n\nGazing out into the cover of night, the radiant moon burning against it, it felt as though Xinan was coming to the end of a chapter of violence. Soon, they would be free of the petty conflicts of bandits and continue on a secure path, even if it was one where the stones were paved by Japan. His predecessors would have balked at such an idea. Cai E would surely be spinning in his grave at the idea of it all, and Lu knew all too well of his cousin Long Yun's disapproval of his methods, regrettable though it was.

In came his secretary, bearing a report from the labour statistician regarding the most optimal distribution of wages to keep as much money in the hands of the government - as much money going to the Reorganized Republic as possible. He walked in, dropped the report, and left without another word. The secretary refused to even look at Lu Han.\n\nFor a moment he just stared. Printed simply at the bottom of the report was its findings: the most optimal distribution of wages was simply not to pay them at all. As an addendum, the work hours of the workers had to be increased by another 4 hours - leaving them with barely enough time to sleep. Only with these conditions could Nanjing's ravenous appetite be met.\n\nOutside his window the sun shined brightly. The clouds rolled lazily across the sky. Vivid visions of the kind of depredations Chinese workers suffered daily in his mines and fields flashed under his eyes, but Lu Han banished them with a blink. It was for the good of all China.

He stopped, and watched it for a moment.\n\n"One can never get away from the war, can they? Even here reached the grenades and the bombs."\nThough Lu Han had meant it as just a passing comment, for some reason it seemed to agitate his cousin considerably.

Night was quickly falling, and the thin coats they both wore were not enough to keep out the ever-increasing chill. Just before the sun dipped entirely out of view, Lu Han responded,\n\n"How far away we are from home - in Zhaotong the mountains entirely blocked the sunset."\n\nThe rest of the journey they walked in silence. The bodyguard suggested a different route home than they usually took, as an extra precaution, so Lu Han was left alone to ponder what had been meant by the question. Was it philosophical? Moral?

There was no one on the street that evening as he reached home, bidding his protection farewell - still none the wiser as to what he was supposed to have said.\n\nWhen the bodyguard reached home, his duties had not yet ended. There was a package to deliver for the men hiding in the mountains, and as he braced himself against the weather it suddenly struck him.

Xinan was growing more and more prosperous by the day. The intellectuals over at the NSAU that blathered about "bloody industrialization" and "playing the sycophant to the Yamato scum" were just blind to the real benefits of his work. Gao Zongwu, on the other hand, was not; Lu had just now received a missive from him commending Yunnan and Xinan's contributions to the Five Modernizations.\n\nIt helped, of course, to know that the insurgencies were not enough to stop Xinan's progression into the modern age.\n\nAccordingly, Lu Han, always one for a good celebration, decided to hold a great countryside gathering in commemoration of his successes, and invite many Sphere delegates and dignitaries. The first person he told of this was his trusted second-in-command, his cousin Long Yun.\n\nWhen Long Yun heard the words from his cousin's mouth, his warlord's instincts, honed over years of ruling Yunnan, told him that the time was soon to come.

If they broke, hatred would break them, leaving them a screaming, incomprehensible mad dog, to be put down.\nBut if they accepted it, nurtured it even, hatred would strengthen them. Sharpen their instincts, their mind, their will... even feed the fickle flame that fuels their life, giving them a bit more time to deal with the cause of their righteous fury.\n\nLu Han was out, on a vacation paid by the costs of the people he exploited, and Yun dearly hoped he would feast to his heart's content, as every man should be able to enjoy their last days."

yun_insurgency.1.desc:0 "It had been almost twenty years since Song Xilian had set foot in China, nearly two decades since the foreign invaders desecrated his home and drove him and the NRA south into Burma. The years since have been defined by their difficulty. In order to survive the NRA had been forced to turn towards criminal activities, the very nature of which Song could feel staining his soul. Yet still they persisted, with the hopes of returning to China and freeing future generations from subservience to the Japanese oppressors.\n\nIt was this dream that propelled the NRA forward. The dishonor of these criminal deeds was miniscule compared to the shame that they would face if they did not attempt to drive out the invaders by any means necessary. So they continued their work diligently, using the resources they amassed to resist the Japanese in any way they could. However, an opportunity was presenting itself to the NRA, and Song Xilian was keen to take advantage of it.\n\nSong had gathered his cabinet together to address them on the state of the NRA. "I know that these years have been hard." He began. "The things we have done will blacken our souls for the rest of our lives. But we have only done what we must to combat those foreign invaders that even now occupy our homeland. I will remind you all that our position has been improving considerably in recent times. Every day we welcome more defectors into our ranks, valuable comrades who are too disgusted to continue working with the Japanese. Soon I assure you, these winter years will end, and we will see a free China once again.""

yun_insurgency.2.desc:0 "Li Mi had spent most of the night working in his office. The cabinet meeting called by Song Xilian, while necessary to discuss the plans for the insurgency, had cost Li Mi valuable time in actually planning said insurgency. Li had two responsibilities to the NRA, the first was to manage all guerilla operations against the Japanese. The second was to conduct the Opium smuggling that provided the much needed capital to fund his first responsibility.\n\nLi Mi knew that many within the NRA were opposed to the smuggling of Opium. Even Song Xilian himself wasn't comfortable with it, although at least he understood its necessity. Indeed, if the NRA didn't engage in the smuggling of Opium then it would have run out of resources years ago, unable to pay its own men or fund its own operations. Li reminded himself of this whenever he himself had doubts about his own actions. He knew that the dream of returning to China trumped all.\n\nLi's mind returned to the task at hand, planning the insurgency. After years of exile the NRA were finally preparing their glorious return to China, and it all would start with an uprising in Kunming. Of course it wouldn't be hard for local officials in the city to notice the massive amounts of men and weapons being smuggled in for preparation, so as a countermeasure Li had prepared bribes. Millions of Yuan and Yen, all generated via Opium smuggling and other illicit operations, would be funneled into Kunming to keep these officials from talking to the Japanese."

yun_insurgency.3.desc:0 "A man makes his way down the Burma Road, sent by the NPA to the NRA. His outfit is designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, just a simple cloak and plain clothes. Getting past the border was easy, the customs officials had been bribed to let him and many others like him through. Once upon a time he was a bandit, imprisoned by the Japanese for wreaking havoc on the countryside. Once he reached prison the NPA offered him a new path in life. They'd spring him out of jail if he would go south and train with the NRA in preparation for the liberation of China. Once, this man was a bandit, fighting only for himself. Now, he is on his way to becoming a soldier, and he will fight for the future of China.\n\nEvery man's story is different, their lives are all unique. Yet many follow this same general cadence. Bandits and criminals being sprung from prison and sent down the Burma Road. Their motives vary from person to person. Some fight for their own personal redemption, driven by a passion to prove their own change in nature. Some fight for their country, being propelled forward out of a love for China. Some fight for revenge, seeking to tear down the Japanese for their humiliation of China.\n\nWhatever their reasons may be, they all walk down the same path. The NRA accepts each and every one of them. Forming an underground army of rebels, ready to spring into action and reclaim their homeland. All of this happens under the noses of the Japanese, their eyes and ears in the area blinded by mountains of money. The stage for an insurrection is being set, the pieces are placed with methodical precision, for the ones placing them know one immutable truth. The fate of China rests on their efforts."

A truck full of Japanese weapons and equipment were due to be delivered to the Burmese. Their mission was simply to intercept it, preventing the Japanese from bolstering their own garrisons and supplying the NRA with more weapons to be used in the liberation of China.\n\nAs the sound of the truck came into range, the NRA soldiers prepared themselves. When the optimal time arrived, they sprung into action. The ensuing fight was as bloody as it was swift. In order to prevent any witnesses from reporting what happened to the Japanese, not a single person was spared from the NRA's wrath. When the fighting had finished the soldiers disposed of the bodies by rolling them down the mountainside, the insurgents commandeered the trucks, and delivered the shipment to the NRA.\n\nThis raid is far from unique. Each night, several NRA teams conduct similar operations. Stealing supplies, blowing up railways, assassinating local officials, all with the aim of either disrupting the Japanese, or strengthening the NRA's position. While in isolation each incident would be a relatively small blow to Japanese power in the region, they quickly add up to a considerable disruption of Japanese hegemony.  And every night more operations are carried out than the last."

Many small towns and villages have had their local governments purged of Japanese collaborators and replaced by NRA bureaucrats, and have been garrisoned by NRA soldiers. This marks the beginning of the NRA's long held goal of exercising all Japanese influence from China.\n\nFor now, if the liberation is to succeed then many different factions of dissidents must at the very least tolerate the existence of one another, lest China fall to infighting and once again become Japanese lap dogs. The NRA has already been working together with the NPA for quite some time, with Zhang Chong working to deepen the ties between the two forces in hopes of achieving their shared goals. What many members of the NRA are less than thrilled by is the emergence of the CPC. With many NRA soldiers and officers being staunch anti-communists, an air of distrust has set in between the two factions.  Yet, Song Xilian, head of the NRA, has preached for a policy of toleration between the two. For now their goals are aligned when it comes to the expulsion of Japanese influence from China.\n\nLuckily, the last two decades have taught the NRA to tolerate practices and ideas that they are uncomfortable with. First it was smuggling opium to finance their guerilla activities, now it is fighting alongside communist soldiers. In the end, they all know that one things matters above all else. Saving China."

yun_insurgency.6.desc:0 "The Gate of Friendship that met Guangxi from Vietnam was like a friend after all these years, a welcoming hand that guided him on the next stop in his journey as it had done for so many others like him. It was an unmistakable feeling for Chen, a communist who had made this trek many times going between his infiltration cell in Yunnan and the remains of the part in Vietnam. And he had someone important to meet.\n\nIt took place secluded in Hanoi, as Chen met three expected figures. Two generals, Chinese like him, a pair of familiar faces who greeted him warmly. But the third he knew in a different manner: the taut and sinewy figure of the leader of the Viet Minh, Vietnam's own united front against the Japanese, who was known as the Most Enlightened One - Ho Chi Minh. After a brief drink and exchanging of pleasantries, the general Yang Chengwu turned to Chen as they all sat together. "Tell me, what information do you have from Yunnan?"\n\n"Well, things have definitely changed," Chen began. "Long Yun has taken a lesser role in governing ever since the end of the war. He's had to share power with his cousin, Lu Han, who's now the recognised leader as far as Japan is concerned. Their main problem is bandits, though. The countryside is awash with them, both resistance networks and petty bandits seeking profit. Lu Han is at least attempting to deal with them, though for now they're still a significant thorn in his side."\n\n"An opportunity, perhaps." Ho spoke plainly yet intuitively, his experience practically radiating off of him in waves. "If they cannot control their countryside, there are untold amounts of people they cannot control - If they can be made to lose more control of their people, they will not be able to truly control their land." He was a man full of wisdom, after all. It was no wonder he had forged such a prominent movement here in Vietnam.\n\nChen had to interject, however. "Perhaps, but something else to consider: From what I had been hearing, Lu Han is attempting to follow the model of the Nanjing government and trying to modernise the province, probably with Japan's help. Lots of new initiatives, new workers... It may be a way in." The other three men shared a look and smiled. He'd made a contribution to the cause, and that made Chen smile too."

After asking after each other's families and trading stories about things that had taken place in the time since they had last seen each other, they fell to reminiscing.\n\nThey looked back to the warm, happier past - a past in which Mao Zedong was still alive, a past in which China was still free and able to fight against the Japanese imperialist menace. Then their minds wandered to the present.\n\nHo asked Ye about how the CPC's return to Yunnan was faring. Ye nodded, satisfied: while Lu Han and Xia Wei's traitors had successfully pushed the CPC out of Yunnan and Guangxi, they had recently succeeded in resuming infiltration warfare in the Southwest - "thanks to certain Vietnamese friends of ours, among others," Ye said, smirking at Ho, who matched his grin with one of his own.\n\nYe continued: "Just like your Viet Minh, our Communist Party has certainly not forgotten how to fight the Japanese imperialists and their running dogs.""

The rural localities were filled to the brim with bandits and "bandits", many of whom were parasitizing the increasingly restive peasantry. The peasantry, in turn, was up in arms because the government seemed to have only one priority: the welfare of the landlords and their wealth.\n\nObviously, the information reflected, while this was enough to give the lie to the brave claims of the Traitor KMT about how "peaceful, modern, and stable" Xinan had become under the rule of the collaborationist government, it was not enough for the rebellion that Marshal Ye had envisioned. Before Yunnan was to rise in revolt against the oppression of the Japanese imperialists, the peasants of the countryside had to be armed.\n\nAs the informant reached the place where his cell had arranged to meet, he was already sketching out ways he could smuggle arms to the peasant farmsteads - not merely for self-defense, of course, but as a preparation for the struggle to come."

They're so preoccupied with their precious modernizations that they aren't paying Guangxi any attention whatsoever."\n\nThe NRA officer opposite him nodded shortly.\n"Yes, we know that all too well; it's how we've maintained our freedom of action all this time. But what do you want us to do with that, Mr. Chen?"\n\nChen nodded. "Marshal Ye has sent me to make an offer to you.

So Wei had decided to hold on to the last thing he could salvage, his own life.\n\nThe breathless escape which had followed left his limbs aching, seized by acid. By now the sharpness of the pain could be felt all across his body, it was so excruciating that he laid down on a bed of rocks as if it were an imperial mattress. Wei breathed. Deep in, then sharply out. Slowly the stillness of the air returned, it was something he had not felt in far too long, now that much of the anxiety of his debt had been cut loose he could finally breathe.\n\nSomewhere along the road the shadow of a man shimmered - he was not alone - more followed. Wei clutched the few belongings he had close to his chest. His legs went stiff, eyes watered over, lungs still gasping for air. It was already obvious how impossible it was for him to keep running.\n\nEventually they reached him.

It had become the first sensation to meet him every morning since he had arrived at the camp, that and the dull smell of the earth. Dirt always crept in, no matter how tightly he wrapped the frayed blankets round himself. Everything was unsophisticated here, yet these last few nights he had slept the soundest in his life. He was safe, but he was not quite home.\n\nAcross from him, on the far side of the camp, there was another man who had been dragged here the night before. His roughshod uniform betrayed him as a conscript, once subservient to Lu Han. As such the conscript had not been fortunate enough to be welcomed like Wei had been, there was always a guard with an eye trained on him and a hesitancy throughout the rest of the camp to share with him any of their dwindling supplies. Wei had heard they had only let him live because he pleaded so desperately for his life; for this reason he felt a sympathy toward the man which he could not ignore.\n\nSlowly, he unraveled himself from the mess of blankets, dusted himself down as best he could, then approached him. The conversation did not come easy between them at first, but soon enough it flowed listlessly, meandering gently through hopes and fears, love and heartbreak, life and death. It did not last. As it never could.\n\nIn the middle of a particularly heart wrenching remembrance of the night Wei abandoned everything, the conscript leapt to his feet and began to wail in alarm. He raised his rifle, the shoddiest in the camp, and let off round after round into his enemy. Wei held his ground too, but he knew the conscript was far too exposed to the soldiers and as he went to shout at him to get back a bullet tore through the conscript's chest.\n\nWei rushed over, though it was already too late. He could see blood start to pool on the other side of the hole the lead had carved whilst he held the man. And as his body began to sink, low and lifeless, into his own he soon realised he had not even thought to ask for the poor conscript's name."

It was not something he had tried to be, not something he relished or found solace in, it was a simple unavoidable fact, one that he accepted with disturbing calmness. Every few days, he and the rest of his newfound allies would find some new estate or traveller to prey on. They would brandish weapons and, in rare cases, use violence to force them to surrender their food and valuables. Then, they would disappear deep into the countryside.\n\nIt was in the aftermath of one of these raids that Wei and his band heard the screaming coming from some village, a place that his allies had decided was unworth the effort of attacking. It seemed that the government had come to a different conclusion. The band watched from the hills as tax collectors and their guards marched men and women into the dirt road. There was crying, sobbing. Old men prostrated themselves in the dirt.\n\n"Are we just going to watch this?" said Wei after a few moments of silence. Below them, the tax collectors had begun searching houses.\n\nA few men turned to look at him, their expressions ranging from shock to sadness to bemusement. "This isn't our fight," said one. "If we get involved we'll be-."\n\n"Bandits?" said Wei. A few of the men broke his gaze to look at their feet. "You found me when I was cold and alone. You took me in when you could have killed me. We need to do the same for these people or all we'll ever be are some fucking cowards and government lapdogs, animals that eat whatever scraps the government leaves behind."\n\nHe was shocked at his own moral outrage. Wei waited for the men to laugh or curse at him. He expected them to expel him from the group and leave him to die on the hill.\n\nInstead, a few of the other men began to nod.

Where once they had been nuisances, they were now heroes.\n\nPerhaps the other men felt this too, the joy of this newfound purpose. Perhaps it is why the men allowed Wei to become their informal leader and had allowed him to move them into Northern Burma. Perhaps it is why they did not question it when Wei marched them into Zhang Chong's encampment and took a meeting with the old rebel leader-who seemed more bemused by Wei's exploits than impressed.\n\n"You have spirit, I'll say that, but you're inefficient and disorganized. Stay with me for a few weeks and I'll make you into something stronger. I'll turn you into liberators," said Zhang.\n\nAnd he did. The work was grueling. More than once, Wei woke up expecting to find that his men had left in the middle of the night. Instead, day by day, week by week, his men remained. They learned how to use military equipment and theories of tactics and strategy. They received uniforms to replace their old ragged clothing. Their bodies became fitter, healthier.\n\nAt the end of the ordeal, Wei realized that he was no longer a bandit but a soldier. It was something that he'd tried to be, something that he relished. He was no longer someone who would prey on the weak for their scraps but someone who would fight and die for China and its people.

And now, guard the shipments of valuable, precious minerals as they were sent straight out into the maw of the Reorganized Republic. Who did Lu Han even serve? One thing was for sure - it wasn't the people of Yunnan, nor was it the people of China.\n\nThe decision to do something had been swift to take. But who to help, who to sponsor them - that debate had raged for hours, late into the night, until finally a sombre silence descended on the two. There was really only one man, wasn't there? Only one candidate who could lead both men - and all of Yunnan.\n\nThe next morning, they cleared both their schedules and checked those of Yunnan's highest dignitaries. Finding the man's empty, Zeng Zesheng picked up the phone and said one thing to the operator:"

You should not be surprised: I did not become Marshal of the Southwest and King of Yunnan by sitting around and doing nothing with a stupid smile on my face.\n\nI am aware of the way in which the battle lines have been drawn, and I am fully willing to side with the National Protection Army to free the motherland. What Lu Han or Gao Zongwu might call "revanchist madness" I call a reassertion of our nation's ancient rights unjustly usurped from it.\n\nHowever, I must make one request. Whatever you do, I must insist that you spare a thought for my cousin in his old age. Whereas collaboration is indeed beneath contempt, blood remains thicker than water, and I must not allow my relatives to be slaughtered on my watch no matter what they have done.\n\nIt is my express wish that when we of the NPA take power Lu Han should be imprisoned but not harmed.\n\nI hope that you will be able to meet this request of mine.\n\nSigned,"

It turned out, much to all the officers' surprise, that Lu Han's blind devotion to Gao Zongwu's modernization program had drawn more enemies than any one of the officers had had in his entire lifetime. Expressions such as "You hate him? I hate him too!" were quite common.\n\nIn Zeng's hand was a letter from Long Yun, indicating his willingness to join the NPA. He was about to pass it around when Long himself appeared at the door.\n\nAfter he was ushered in, Long sat down into a chair Zeng had gotten hold of for him and spoke briefly. "You gentlemen are aware that I'm on your side from here on in, with one major condition, correct?"\n\n"Yes, sir," said one of the officers, "but I'm not sure what this condition was. I don't think General Zeng got to it before you joined us, sir."\n\nLong smiled slightly. "Here is my only condition. When you take my cousin prisoner, do not execute him. Imprison him under decent conditions if he does not resist."\n\nThe officers, though at first hesitant, nodded. An spoke for all of them: "We can agree to that, Marshal."\n\nLong's smile widened somewhat. "Very good, gentlemen."

And when the time comes, I will join you, and together we will drive out the pests that infest our motherland together."\n\nA sharp clack echoed through the room as the NPA all clicked their heels together and saluted in unison. They found it difficult to breathe as emotion caught in their throat. Finally, he had returned.\n\nFinally, the King of Yunnan stood before them.\n\n"We will fight to our last breath, and then after that. May the final drop of our blood be shed in the perseverance and protection of our motherland."\n\nLong Yun watched the men as they filed out, their shadows dancing against the wall as the flame in the lantern sputtered and jolted.

They said as much to the man they called Zhizhou, but he was deep in thought with a smile on his face.\n\nThat was because Long Yun was pleasantly surprised. Very much so, in fact. He had not expected that brave resistors - still less the household names like Song Xilian, Li Mi, Zhang Chong - would still be alive and kicking the Japanese imperialists and their running dogs in the teeth.\n\nEven better, it warmed his heart beyond belief to know that neither he nor they were alone. For, Zeng and An had told him, countless were the brave civilians offering aid and succour to the brave resistance forces, even though the Japanese imperialist bastards had won two decades ago.\n\nLeaving his reveille, Long looked at his two fellow resistance fighters and stood up. It was his turn, now, to fight for the freedom of the Chinese people, and the nation he and so many loved so deeply."

Soldiers and civilians - many of them affiliated with the National Protection Army - who were told that the Governor's esteemed cousin was about to make a speech, gathered in front of a stage in Kunming.\n\nThey did not expect General Long Yun to make a powerful speech, saying that Lu Han - the man he had once venerated as a great, honorable warrior for a free China - was dead and the one that remained was a mere running dog of the Japanese imperialists and Wang Jingwei's brainwashed slaves in Nanjing. Nor, for that matter did they expect Long Yun to name himself King of Yunnan again, or pledge to demand justice and fairness for his people.\n\nThe people were pleasantly surprised and began to applaud; the NPA was loud in its approval. Zeng Zesheng and An Enpu were very satisfied with what they saw. They were even happier to witness the army standing to arms, changing its loyalty, and saluting its new leader.\n\nAt the same time, the National Associated Southwest University made its move: mobilizing their connections in the cities under the call of Wang Jiayou, they forced those local officials that had not already defected to surrender under insurmountable pressure. The peasants in rural areas, often inflamed by NSAU-linked agitators, did much the same, putting down those that had exploited them for so long with the help of the incoming partisans from Vietnam. Those members of the police that were not aligned with Long Yun also gave in quickly when they saw that the army was not with them.\n\nWhen the lone messenger, pursued by NPA forces, reached Nanjing to tell Gao Zongwu what had happened, it was too late. By the time Gao had processed the news long enough to put his head in his hands, Long Yun had solidified control over the whole of Xinan, and even Sichuan is under the threat of the NPA now."

Meanwhile, their leadership - not least among these Song Xilian, Li Mi, and Zhang Chong - moved to leave the matters of mobilization to their subordinates and rush to Kunming with a small retinue to prepare for the inevitable.\n\nWhen Long Yun, flanked as he always was by Zeng Zesheng and An Enpu, saw the three generals coming towards them from the southwest, he ran out from the gatehouse without his sandals and embraced them, calling them to eat and drink a little with him before they set to work. The reunion party between the old fellow fighters against foreign imperialism was cheerful but relatively short; after all, there was much work to be done.\n\nNow that the NPA, NRA, and Xinan were united in one purpose, they were free to continue the War of Resistance that had never ended and fight unto death to cleanse the Japanese crimes in the motherland."

However, just then there were two loud wraps on the door to his office. "Come in!" he accidentally shouted before restraining himself. Jiang Zemin walked in through the swinging door, followed by Ye Jianying, Yang Dezhi and Yang Chengwu in single file. Sharply and quickly, they arrived at Long's desk as quickly as he had processed that they had arrived.\n\nThe Governor was unable to hide his shock and amazement at their unexpected arrival, and it took him a few moments to speak. "I... I didn't know any of you were coming, this is most unexpected".\n\nYe shrugged, "Well, even though your forces and the NPA at large haven't been in direct contact with our cells for nearly 20 years, this young man here always got us connected. We came as soon as we heard the news last week." The others nodded in affirmation. Jiang placed a briefcase on Long's desk as Ye Jianying spoke up.\n\n"It's good to see you again Governor... 3 decades have felt like lifetimes, given the circumstances...". Long merely nodded, attempting to remain professional while elated beyond compare inside.\n\nFifteen minutes later, Jiang had pulled out a marked map from 1946 and spread it across the desk. The group, joined by several NPA members huddled around the desk, as Yang Dezhi and Yang Chengwu described the situation and went over a detailed plan should the Collaborationists attack Yunnan. One way or another, they all knew they would all have to fight like hell to free China, and to free their people.

Supporting the Long-aligned guerilla movements in the chaotic state should be our first protocol, especially while Gao Zongwu uses his expanded resource base, á la the Modernizations, to bump up local garrisons and militias.\n\nWe stand both poised and prepared to settle the issue of Sichuan once and for all. With quick and swift action, we can seize the initiative and possibly even the forces of Xikang. Liu Wenhui, the representative of that historic zone, sits undecided between our two forces. Swift action will incline him to join our side, and biding our time will only allow [GetWISichuanSide] a better chance to crack down.\n\nSichuan, by all accounts, will be the final straw.

The muddy roads where the dirt mixed with the melting snow, the budding, short grass, and the shy pink blush of the cherry trees, blooming in the early spring breeze. The old man wore a robe weaved from flax, and below it he wore a cotton shirt and trousers. In his hand was a walking stick, and on his foot was a worn sandal made out of rope. On his shoulders, he carried a burlap sack: provisions for the road ahead. The weather was warm, and although the winds still had the winter's sting, he found the weather refreshing.\n\nHalfway to his destination, while the sun was still high, he sat beside spring trees. The grass was dry now, the dew evaporating in the heat. The old man unslung the burlap sack from his shoulders, and ate the bread that his men had cooked for him. He watched the cherry blossoms flutter in the air. One brushed his cheek. Occasionally, a uniformed man on horseback would pass by him in silence. After finishing his food, he stood up.\n\nWhen he arrived in Kunming, the sun was setting. He stopped by a cart bearing all kinds of baked goods, and bought for himself a bean jam-filled bread. He strolled through the streets, taking in the city's sights, before setting himself down on a wooden bench, its surface coarse due to rain and snow. Long ago, the Buddhist sages would pass through Kunming, whether they were Chinese, Indian, or Tibetan. The spires and pagodas of Kunming, ornate in their mixture of red and gold, gilded in the rose-gold colors of the sky and sunset, cast long shadows on the ground, like hands of a clock.\n\nWhen he came back, he thought, all of this would burn.

Let a single stroke of his pen erect another monstrous instrument of blood and sweat from the ground, and a hundred living, writhing Chinese bodies be sacrificed on the altar and hurled into its howling furnaces, then a hundred more, then yet a hundred more, all in the name of "progress", of a "brighter" future for eons to come! Yet no mountain of hollow rhetoric, no cascade of smelting iron shall wash away who the almighty President truly is: a docile, brainless mutt, drooling at whatever his dogmasters dangle in front of him and happily licking their buttocks. His prized "Modernizations" are but a gilded cage, a venture upon shoddy foundations; and the "freedom" and "prosperity" that is promised to follow, a rotten delusion, a lie.\n\nSecond after fleeting second the thoughts gnawed at the King of the Southwest's mind, and at times he almost darted up from his seat and thrashed his pen to the ground, yet a fragment of reason held him back. Perhaps, he had made a misjudgment. Even Wang Jingwei, the arch-traitor himself, had had a glint of doubt and shame dancing within his eyes, as Long had witnessed within the very confines of Kunming in the waning days of 1938. Perhaps, there was still a slimmer of honor, of reason, of some basic fucking dignity lingering within the man sitting atop the Presidential Palace?\n\nHe closed his eyes as those memories of ages past departed his aging mind, hunched over his wooden desk, and began with the letter.

The villages that clung to the forested foothills were no more than specks of dust to the human eye, wavering in the heatwaves of the southern Chinese summer. Trees bloomed with lush intensity, teeming with verdant leaves that seemed to catch and reflect the sun's brilliance. Far away, in the distance, a column of smoke flickered. A hot and humid wind heaved with heavy sighs as it cut across the foliage, grasslands, and pastures. Slamming, diverting, as it met the high walls of the village houses.\n\nThrough his father's binoculars, Li Yuan observed the world. The son of a partisan, he and his family had first ascended the mountains as the National Revolutionary Army scattered before the Japanese advance. Having spent his boyhood here, hiding in the ravines and caverns of Yunnan's rugged western landscape, he had grown to become a deeply inquisitive young man. From his perch, he could look south and see Burma, or swing east to gaze upon Laos. On a good day, the diaphanous mists that covered his field of view would come unwrapped, revealing a land so strange, yet so familiar, rich in sights and scenes. Yet, none of them could compare to the view of China, to the east and north.\n\nThis, as he recalled his father saying, a callused and weather-beaten hand on his boy's shoulders, is our land. This is your land. Five days ago, the general had issued an order: they would finally come down the mountains. Li's chest pounded like war-drums at the thought.

He saw volunteer forces, belonging to the almost extinguished Chinese Communist Party, hailing from the interior of Vietnam and the neighbouring Indochinese nations, plus the various insurgent groups sprawled all around the south-eastern perifieries of China.\n\nThey kept to their own little respective groups, but the fact that they had gathered at all filled Li's heart with a dull sense of hope. Long Yun's speech had motivated them all into action, and his actions had motivated them into speeches. They spoke loudly about the liberation of their massive home nation, from the "Republican" Chinese collaborator state, to the vast, industrialised cities of Manchuria and all the semi-independent cliques in between. It filled him with a certain pride he hadn't felt in decades.\n\nLi walked himself out of the meeting hall, opening up one of the side doors in the valley that surrounded it. Being only a minor officer in his guerilla group, his presence was appreciated rather than required. He stared out across the valley. It was jam packed with camouflaged camps, bikes, motorcycles, cars and trucks, with little streams of men flowing between it all.\n\nThey would fight for China's honour, and for the ultimate repulsion of the Japanese menace.

Some of the men were far too old to have any business fighting another war, so the Corps set out on a recruitment campaign that eventually reached Li's village. Despite some of the older soldiers retiring, it was rumoured that Long Yun himself would be leading the unit into battle, as their Chief Commander. That excited Li to no end.\n\nIt was only now, on the eve of joining his soon to be comrades, did Li feel afraid. He sat in the back of a flatbed truck with a few other recruits, tailing the end of a convoy. The engine had already given out a couple times, and the rest of the convoy had seen it prudent to continue driving after the second faltering. Now, night had truly descended over the valley the flatbed slowly crawled down.\n\nHe thought his heart would give out when he first heard it. Every kid from Yunnan could recite the song, they had heard it so many times. This time, he heard it from the throats the song was actually about, the 60th Corps. At first he could only hear the rhythm, the words a jumble of incomprehensible jargon, but as the flatbed rounded the bend, Li could both hear the song and the men singing it:\n\n"We are from the great place of Yunnan Uprising, across Kueichou and Hunan, march to the battlefield to repel invaders, brothers dedicate their flesh, strive for nation's emancipation, to protect the glory, that's all that's left for us."

Xinan had taken up arms much like the rest of Long-aligned China; now it meant to use them.\n\nLong recalled the Northern Expedition to his audience. "The ancient honour of battle requires our sweat, our blood, our tears! I take immense pride in all of my sons, as does your homeland! We shall go forth and free every one of China's sons! We shall go forth and banish the Japanese to across the waters from which they came!"\n\nBut, in his mind, he thought differently. This war was to be against a foe far more advanced than the one he faced forty years ago. They had the numbers, the guns, the planes, the supplies, not to mention aid from one of the world's foremost superpowers...\n\nLong Yun shook his head. There was no point pondering "what-ifs" now. There would be no return. China would fight for its freedom, or die a death of a thousand cuts. The Japanese would exploit his homeland until it had no more to give, and then some. "No!"

Fret no more, however, for right here and now I give my word: the entire Xikang shall flock to your aid.\n\nOf course, woe is me for having to wrestle mountains of my own men just to deliver this message. Skeptics both young and old litter our ranks, grumbling of "insurmountable odds" and advocating for sanctuary under the "greater government". Audacious enough to decry supposed suicide and throw threats of desertion at my face, yet too faint-hearted to embrace the truth - how will there be any sanctuary, any safe haven under the Rising Sun, when its rays remain slick with our blood?\n\nThe retort I gave them was simple. Had the entire War Against Japanese Aggression been suicide, by that logic? Had the demises and sacrifices of millions of our warriors and patriots, just so the rest of us in Xikang could live on as free men, been suicide? No. Never was before, and never will be now. To commit suicide is to die for selfishness; to perish on the battlefield in our one last shot at freedom, however, is to die for a cause far more sublime - so that our descendants may live, and be welcomed into this world by a bright, free China. Arduous a task it may be, the rogue officers were eventually made to see reason once more; that, I'm more than grateful for.\n\nNo more overtalk necessary.

Surely it made more sense that, as he'd heard, Long would just let the soldiers do what they wanted. Was this actual sympathy or a necessary show of familial kindness to placate the people? It mattered not, in any case. What mattered was that his cousin, who had fought back-to-back with him for twenty years, had stabbed him in the back.\n\nAll the work Lu Han had put into developing Xinan was being poured out like water for a suicidal crusade to liberate China, bringing all the blood and tears that Lu and Xinan had shed to nothing.

Ever since his War of National Liberation had begun, the opposing Reorganised Government had been flailing - Their army weak just as the King of the Southwest had predicted. Optimism had been flying high for a quick advance - And then these reports had come crawling in as if to smother such hopes.\n\nIt had begun as murmurs, then evolved into scattered reports, and now had matured to be hard communication from his generals. The Reorganised Government had begun fielding... certain elite soldiers. Ones that far outshined any other on the battlefield, friend or foe. Well disciplined, well armed, and with an unyielding fighting spirit, determined to the last to destroy their foe. They were not men from the IJA nor top-of-the-line foreign mercenaries - They were assuredly Chinese. They may well have the will to be a true opponent to the Liberation Front, and the generals all reported that as each day goes by, they only grow in number.\n\nA secret army. And yet the war had been going so well before now - A string of victories against the collaborating scum. Doubts stirred within Long Yun as he rubbed his temples. Has he been deceived?  If so... It was by Gao. Gao Zongwu was the severed head of the dragon that Japan had impaled on a stick and hailed as "China", a coward who willingly sold his nation to the Emperor in Tokyo. He wouldn't rule out a cheap trick, but for what reason? A highly trained secret army practically burrowing from the ground in Nanjing - Had he been planning to fight? If not against him, then... against his overlord?\n\nLong Yun shot to his feet, the sheer adrenaline of such an idea seeming to force him to action. "No." He said out loud, only to himself. Gao Zongwu was a traitor to his country, and far too spineless to consider going against his master. He had sent these elites to fight the Liberation Front, after all. He had no sympathy for his own countrymen fighting for freedom, and that alone would seal his fate. Let his elite force come - They are only the next test in line.

That hellhole had been filled to the brim with a whole lot of Hanjian collaborators even worse than Wang Jingwei and his followers. Whereas Wang's lot tried to make it seem like they were their own country, the bastards of the NCPC didn't even show the slightest hesitation in choosing to betray the nation that bore them.\n\nTo the brutish, imperialist Japanese empire, the NCPC were their loyal subordinates in China. To the true sons of China such as those assembled in Long Yun's command tent, they were the worst traitors of all Chinese history, worse even than Wang and Gao put together. Hence why so many NPA officers snarled at the news.\n\nBut the NPA restrained itself: they had not made it past Chongqing and into È and Xiāng like so many clones of Zhang Fei. For now, it was decided that NPA forces would remain outside of NCPC-held land. To do otherwise, after all, would just lead to full-scale war in the form of a Japanese intervention to protect the de-jure puppet state, which was something that everyone in the NPA knew they couldn't afford.\n\nIt was decided, then, that the NPA would instead follow the footsteps of the former National Revolutionary Army and secure the South first before marching towards the long-lost northern lands. While they found it strange that Gao still did not call for Japan's intervention despite the severity of the situation, they cared not: it suited them perfectly. Whether it was borne out of overconfidence or foolishness did not matter, for Gao would soon be given cause to regret his hostility towards the righteous forces of the NPA."

These shameless, subhuman scum are more shameless than even Wang, Gao and his ilk. They willingly submitted to and cooperated with the Demon Emperor in Tokyo even before Wang did. Old habits clearly died hard; these worms ran to Japan's aid and usurped North China for the Rising Sun before we could liberate it at first.\n\n3. Unfortunately, we cannot deliver justice to those of the NCPC that died of old age, such as Wang Kemin and Wang Yitan. But the remnants shall have no such luck. They will be imprisoned for now and put on public trial after the war ends. Those who suffered under their misrule will be allowed to watch the final fate of their oppressors, and we will make sure they are given the fullest justice we can mete out.\n\nGlory to Free China! Death to the traitors!"

More literate members of our corps of soldiers and officers have reflected on the significance of today's events. After all, Manchuria was the first Chinese region to fall under the control of the Japanese.

All they ever cared about was money and material goods. To them, it did not matter who governed their citadels of opulence, could be British, Japanese, German, who cares?

What nonsense, the real ruthless scourges of China reared their ugly heads when it became apparent they could not buy themselves out of this situation.

When Long Yun declared his intent to hand over the government to a civilian authority when China was liberated, many of the National Protection Army officers looked mutinous. Long Yun ignored them. Having seen what martial law had done for China, he knew quite well that only a civilian government was suited to rule his country. He had to see to that, or else the Japanese would have an easy time coming back.\n\nWhen everything had been discussed and the differences between people had at least been papered over, Long Yun led the assembled United Front leaders to swear a great oath that was broadcast by radio all over China. As it sounded from the few radios that people had available to them, collaborationists ground their teeth or questioned their loyalties, while revolutionaries were on cloud nine.\n\nLong Yun uttered the words of the oath and made his new allies repeat after him.\n"We, of the Third United Front, do solemnly swear to free China from the Japanese oppression, and not to rest until we have reclaimed all of our nation.

If the Chinese government so wishes, ceasefire talks can proceed immediately without delay. However, we are obliged to warn that if the hitherto unrecognized government desires peace, it must oblige Japan's interest in keeping unoccupied sovereign territories of Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Guangdong to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nWe hope that, with the conclusion of this letter, that China and Japan could once again come into accord, as in the days of governments past. The Government of Japan has been generous to the extreme, and the Foreign Ministry hopes that Japan's desire for peace is respected."\n\nLong Yun held the letter in his hands, fuming in anger. They swaddle their insults in cordial diction; they insult China's will to free herself from her enemies.

The State believes that it is in its greatest interest to pursue its territorial claims, which the Empire had violated in the aftermath of 1931 War, and thereafter in 1933 establishment of the illegitimate state of Manchukuo. Additionally, the State declares that it does not recognize the State of Guangdong, nor the agreements that had brought it into existence.\n\n"We recognize, however, that the Japanese government desires peace. In accordance to this wish, the State would offer ceasefire on its own terms. Japanese troops are to vacate the Three Eastern Provinces, and to return Guangdong and its cities back to the State.

We have earned China her long-lost freedom, with our blood and flesh; today, at last, peace beckons to her, and there is no more reason for us to reject it.\n\nYet already, other voices are bubbling within our ranks. The offer made no mention of the Maguan Treaty, nor did it concern the concoctions of other imperialists behind our backs. The Islands of Taiwan and Kuye still lie in Japanese clutches, and claiming victory right now will make them remain so for the foreseeable future. China, yet still, clamors for justice - justice that we, woefully, cannot serve in full. The truth is, our naval force stands practically nonexistent, let alone comparable to the juggernauts of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The people will understand our choice, just as we have understood their hearts.\n\nThere is one more option: cross the Yalu River, march into the Korean Peninsula, and demand from the tyrant everything it has robbed from us.

No other site is more fitting than Weihaiwei, then, as the testament to this reversal of fates - that China has arisen, unbowed, triumphant over her erstwhile overlords.\n\nThe Accords itself largely follows Tokyo's prior proposal along with one additional clause: the Islands of Taiwan and Kuye are hereby nominally restored under Chinese governance, under the condition that formal transfer procedures be "temporarily" postponed "until the establishment of pertinent institutions". As both parties are fully aware, however, this article is nothing more than a concession: for hawkish elements within the NPA, to China's lackluster naval power, and for Japan, to China's restored might and sovereignty.\n\nFor now, however, peace will suffice.

The result was a military junta; most freedoms were suppressed, and people that dissented from the junta's line could be subject to harassment and worse.\n\nMany people did not know what to make of this new development. To their mind, the future fate of China - which had seemed so clear while Long Yun was in charge - was now blurry. Though China had been victorious, and the officers of the victorious junta had in fact led China to that victory, a military junta had never been an ideal or permanent way to rule.\n\nTo people watching the situation play out, it was a repeat of the rule of the martyred Chiang Kai-Shek. But Chiang at least had had the support of many civilian KMT institutions; this new junta, on the other hand, had been forced to trudge along a familiar road without knowing the lay of the land.\n\nDangers lay ahead, and the military government and people of free China had to be prepared to face it.\n\n"

"General Zeng, Marshal Ye, the National Southwestern University, the Grand General" were the sort of names he heard when crates of cooked food or boxes of supplies were unloaded.\n\nNo matter what the workers were doing, their emotions were the same, Huang noticed. Whether they were playing mahjong during a break, eating a rare preparation of freshly-cooked food sent as a special gift from a grateful military official, or working away at sending what guns and bullets they could send to the frontlines, the atmosphere was thick with fear, excitement, patriotism, revanchism, and bloodlust. Huang felt no shame in joining his fellows in that mindset.\n\nAs Huang did his small part to help bring the Japanese bastards down, he realized had never felt more alive in his life."

Of course that didn't mean anything right now, not compared to the dilemma that faced him as he noisily slurped down some passable noodle soup in a radio station in downtown Kunming.\n\nWhat dilemma was this? Simple: Luo Rui just didn't know what on earth to broadcast on the next propaganda broadcast. Repeats of old patriotic songs or of Yue Fei's "River of Blossoms" could only go so far. And General Long had been very explicit that he did not want the propaganda effort to be predicated upon every word that issued forth from his mouth. (Rui quite admired that about the General.)\n\nLooking through a stack of literature that had been sent over from the University, Rui happened upon the works of Qu Yuan, a poet of the late Warring States period. Reading this ancient poet's work more closely, Rui realized that there was an undercurrent of what one might even call patriotism in the old words.\n\n... Perhaps there was something there, Rui thought as he flipped more vigorously through the book. Perhaps... yes!\n\nFrom the next week, recitations of Qu Yuan, now increasingly referred to as the "first patriotic poet of Chinese history", dotted every radio broadcast from that transmitter in Kunming. This was the beginning of a trend that influenced propaganda throughout the NPA territories, and, eventually, the culture of China after the war ended."

For the late General, it had been Yuan Shikai's egomaniacal attempt to declare himself Emperor after all the effort China had wasted throwing the Aisin Gioro scum down. For Long, it was of course a pretentious set of false leaders grinding China into dust in the name of modernizing it, backed by a foreign imperialist power that had occupied it in the name of freeing it from oppression.\n\nJust like in the National Protection War, the battle Long was fighting seemed unlikely to end in victory. But for Cai things changed very quickly: many of Yuan's generals opposed his insane quest to crown himself, and defections took place en masse.\n\nWould there be defections in the NPA's favour, on the other hand?

I demand that all Japanese remove themselves from Chinese soil. I compel all traitors to submit themselves before the legitimate government of China."\n\n"I call on all loyal sons of China: Join me and strike against Gao Zongwu and his foreign masters! Join me and fight for our future! Will you not die for a free China? Will you not give your blood for our homeland? Will you suffer the Japanese to live?"\n\nLiberation is upon us! The hundreds of years of shame that we have endured is finally at an end! All we must do is fight for it! We must fight for our future!"\n\nIt was perfect. This was the way that he convinced the people of China to fight. They had laid in the dirt, showing their bellies akin to tamed pups when the Japanese invaded. The speech before his very eyes would fix this ancient wrong. Revanchism would see Long's cause through to victory, shattering the false illusion of "Pan-Asianism" the Japanese used o-so many times to disguise their exploitation as aid.\n\nThis speech shall be heard by every Chinese man, woman and child in Yunnan.

He had never actually bought anything; He always just told servants what he wanted and they went to the market where, theoretically, they exchanged money, the cost, for the requested item. He hadn't the faintest idea how much money those things costed or what was considered expensive and what was considered cheap. It hurt his head.

While the Road will indeed be completed quickly, it will also cost much more than it potentially needs to.\n\nThe second plan calls for a balance between expenses and time.

The Road will be completed in a reasonable amount of time for an appropriate cost.\n\nThe third plan calls for frugality above all else.

yun.206.desc:0 "After long, hard months of labor, the Burma Road has finally been restored to its former glory. Hundreds of miles of shattered roads and collapsed bridges have been swept away and replaced with modern, robust infrastructure. The gateway to Xinan has been thrown open.\n\nOf course, certain NRA clusters have woefully evaded extermination, clinging on to their pitiful existence and harassing blameless merchant caravans along the pathways still; but that is all those pests dared to do anymore, for our loyal garrisons have taught them a splendid lesson with hails of freshly-supplied lead. The age of relentless banditry is past; all our drivers on the road need to do today is exercise the bare minimum of caution.\n\nAlready, goods and resources have begun flowing once more from Burma to Xinan, and then onwards to the rest of the Republic of China. Trucks, stuffed full of consumer goods from every brand imaginable, quickly speed their precious cargo to newly opened stores all across the region. The people of Xinan, old and young, peasant and worker, Han and Yi, all infatuated with the new clothes, toys, and kitchenware appliances, are only too willing to pay the surprisingly low prices.\n\nThe same good fortune cannot be said of village artisans, weavers, and cottage industrialists. Xinan's isolation had allowed them to persist even as the rest of the world changed. With the reconstruction of the Burma Road, these separate worlds have violently collided and this timelessness is no longer possible.\n\nFar away from both the new aspiring consumers and old fading producers of the Southwest, Lu Han sits, content; his eyes, however, gazes firmly towards the horizon. It isn't just about the prosperity of two provinces; no. The Burma Road, above all else, will make China strong.\n\nHis dream - his sacred mission - is one step closer to realization."

yun_zhengtong.0.t:0 "The National Southwestern Associated University"
yun_zhengtong.0.desc:0 "Since the Japanese were prevented from attacking the territories in the far west of China before peace was signed, the citizens of those regions enjoyed significantly greater freedom than their brethren held in the subjugation of the Nanjing Government. As a result, in the aftermath of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the province of Yunnan became one of the last bastions of free Chinese intellectualism as refugees fled to the southwest from the now-enslaved homeland. The National Southwestern Associated University, called NSAU in short in English, was the prime example of this.\n\nOf course, the Nanjing and Tokyo governments knew this. They constantly sent letters and threats - all of them impotent, there was nothing that either could do at such a distance for something so relatively inconsequential - demanding that the NSAU be subject to restrictions or "brought into closer harmony with the Pan-Asian concept". Both Lu Han and Long Yun took great pride in rubbishing any and all such demands when they came; as a result, the NSAU enjoyed significant academic freedom despite the presence of a large group of Japanophiles. Thanks to the influence of this free university, the Yunnan state education system was one of the best in the RGOC regime in terms of academic quality and learning atmosphere.\n\nHowever, there was a drawback to this. These intellectuals, rather than thanking Lu Han for his magnanimity towards them, became increasingly dissatisfied with Lu Han's collaborationism and more and more sympathetic to the NPA movement. They began to hope against hope that the legacy of the National Protection War would be reborn one day, that the spirit of the May 4th Movement would be inherited and restored to glory.\n\nBut it was not yet to be. There was no Cai E leading them. So all they did for now was resort to limited protests and small gestures of assistance to the insurgencies... for the moment."

yun_zhengtong.1.t:0 "The Zealot"
yun_zhengtong.1.desc:0 "Amidst the intellectuals of the National Southwestern Associated University, one young teacher stood head and shoulders above the rest: Jiang Zemin, the professor of electrical engineering. This man was one of the most talented and passionate academicians the college had ever seen.\n\nBut academic qualities alone did not contribute to Jiang's fame: what made him outshine his peers was his particularly progressive, albeit subtle, political views. Most notable of all were two things: first, his zealous hatred for Japan's colonialism that it passed off as 'Pan-Asianism', and second, his open and hash disgust towards Lu Han's program of collaboration with Nanjing.\n\nIt then came as no surprise that Jiang was known to sympathize openly with the insurgencies, particularly the NPA. In furtherance of that ideology, nowadays he had even started holding some talks and lectures in the humanities. While his influence was growing day by day, Jiang currently was merely treated as someone sympathetic with the Reformists led by Tao Xisheng - an old friend of the President himself. Jiang's proactivity in Nanjing matters only reinforced this view.\n\nThis combined with the relative academic freedom seen in the NSAU and the fact that as far as anyone knew Jiang only spoke and did not act, had protected Jiang from trouble thus far. Of course, if they realized what Jiang was really up to, he would have been arrested and even beheaded as a traitor and reactionary. Fortunately for Jiang, most others knew nothing about him beyond the basics that have been stated above. The complete picture of Jiang and his actions was known only to a few - almost all outsiders, far away from Lu Han's reach.\n\nNonetheless, Jiang was now a rising star in Yunnan as proof of the growing Reformist influence.\n\nIt was not yet known just how much Yunnan would be influenced by this zealous young man."

yun_zhengtong.2.t:0 "The Zealot Flourishes"
yun_zhengtong.2.desc:0 "Just as with many others born in the midst of China's century of humiliation, Jiang Zemin had a strange background. Born in 1926, he was originally an undergraduate in the National Central University of Nanjing. When the war ended and a ceasefire was signed, Jiang graduated with a bachelor's degree. Looking around, he noticed that Lu Han had allowed the continuation of the NSAU, formed by universities that had retreated from the mainland. So Jiang moved to Yunnan to pursue his academic dreams instead of staying under the sight of those Japanese and Hanjian scum he had long despised. His old friend Wang Jiayou, who had given Jiang the idea in the first place, followed him to Kunming.\n\nThe NSAU, appreciating Jiang's competence and talent, jumped at the chance of having him work with them. Eventually, he got a doctorate, which he then used to become a professor of electrical engineering at the university. But as he continued his engineering work, he increasingly advocated for the claims and opinions of the NPA in Yunnan as well as those of the student dissidents in Nanjing.\n\nOne day, after completing his lectures, Jiang was on his way back home. His ruminations were interrupted by some police who 'recognized' Jiang as a political dissident and attempted to stop him. (This was, in fact, just an attempt to extort the well-dressed Jiang to make 'a voluntary contribution' to their poor salaries.) Jiang began to rebuke them in fluent Japanese; the 'responsible' police officers were left with no choice but to apologize, nod stupidly and run away.\n\nThis was a regular part of Jiang's routine; watching the officers run away, he thought that as much as he had hated to pick up Japanese it had served him damn well so far. Returning home, Jiang began his nightly work - writing 'notes and reports' to his 'comrades' and organizing 'names' that needed strong attention. After that, he set about writing a letter about Yunnan's situation and his experience so far to a 'friend' of his in Nanjing."

yun_zhengtong.3.t:0 "The Zealot Makes a Move"
yun_zhengtong.3.desc:0 "While Jiang was personally aligned with the National Protection Army, he formally refused to take more action than words and small speeches. On paper, he was just a university staffer devoid of definite means to support the movement - even though he did secretly fund them bit by bit with a part of his salary.\n\nBut the true reason for his apparent silence was that he did not dare risk exposing his true identity in case Lu Han's occasional crackdowns fell upon him.\n\nHe kept contact with a few officials and officers within Lu Han's cabinet to serve the movements organized by him and his 'comrades'. On the other hand, his attitude towards the bandits is a more complicated one. While he sympathized with their causes and the reasons behind their actions, he didn't think it justified what the groups did to innocent peasants and citizens (though landlords and the wealthy were, of course, fair game).\n\nBut that didn't prevent Jiang from taking action to help the poor - today, he was in his office, doing some of his routine work: the 'secretary' standing beside him gave him a letter. After reading it, Jiang scribbled out some replies to his 'superior' and asked for the next steps to carry out. Nodding and smiling, the man left the room, and Jiang lost himself briefly in his thoughts. After a brief moment, he went out too - to join another strike he had organized in support of the workers and to remonstrate with Lu Han's government.\n\nThe agenda was relatively simple. He gave a speech denouncing Lu Han and Nanjing's rule. Then he taught worker music (usually socialist songs with a twist) to the audience, and invited more people to come for his talks and activities, or even join his 'student society'. Back at the office, Jiang packed up and made for his next destination: a place where a group of bandits was rumored to be hiding."

yun_zhengtong.4.desc:0 "If one were to ask Lu Han what he thought about the National Southwestern Associated University, he would have no choice but to say, "it's complicated."\n\nOn the one hand, he had repeatedly refused Tokyo and Nanjing's requests to shut down dissent in the NSAU or, failing that, the school itself. That was because he wanted to use it for the political balancing act he played all the time as Governor of Yunnan, as well as to help keep social discontent in check. On the other hand, the dissident voices were going from an annoyance to a genuine threat to the stability of the government of Yunnan. Rumor even had it that some of these people in the NSAU faculty were even secretly helping the insurgencies. Recently, he had ordered some nominal crackdowns on the college and even arrested some of the more loudmouthed intellectuals - but he couldn't push further given his reluctance to do such things in the first place.\n\nToday, Lu Han had been informed about a young loudmouth named Jiang Zemin. Looking at Jiang's blustering, Lu could only conclude that this stripling was too young, too simple, and sometimes naive. As an elder, Lu Han had seen much more of the world. After all, he had stood and fought against the Japanese invaders in countless battles - Xuzhou, Wuhan and Changsha not least among them. This Jiang, on the other hand, had nothing better to do with his life but fiddle with circuits and try to make big news by criticizing Lu with Western theories, as well as fabricating and spreading scandals about his regime. \n\nNow Lu starts feeling angry to these incapable kids, "Perhaps," Lu thought, "I should go in and lead the crackdown myself to offend this kids a bit - if they are not too agile to catch up to me." He shook that thought off within a few minutes. "Never mind that. I'm too busy with making a big fortune for Xinan anyway, and being low-key is smarter. Besides, no matter what these pointy-headed scholars say, I'll back Mr. Gao to the hilt. I've no responsibility to teach these little imbeciles my life lessons as an elder - I'm not their grandfather, and I don't pay for their anything. Why should I worry about their capabilities?""

Paying a visit to the platform that sent trains from Kunming to Haiphong, he sent a group of 'volunteers' on board to their destination - Vietnam. According to Jiang's organization, Vietnam had a need for Yunnanese volunteers for the purpose of "furthering the cause of Pan-Asianism". With Jiang's fluent Japanese, the officers have no reason to doubt him, happily giving him the tickets he needed.\n\nBut that was not his only mission. Another train was on its way to Kunming, coming in at a different platform, and he was responsible for taking away the cargo that had been sent to him. Inside the cargo was supplies needed for his 'peers' in the organization he ran. The average observer believed that it was merely Jiang being very generous to the students and staff as always.\n\nEven that wasn't the end of Jiang's work. There was somebody he had to greet. At yet another platform, a passenger came off a train and shook his hand.  Exchanging greetings and letters, they left the station together, going to the NSAU library to 'share thoughts and experience' - obviously, no one would doubt that given Jiang's identity. Wang Jiayou was waiting for them in the library - Jiang and his companion seemed to expect this.\n\nAfter entering a private room owned by a 'student society', Jiang ensured that no one would sneak in. The door was locked and the window was blocked, before Jiang turned to exchanging secret signs and gestures with those already in the room -\n\n- signs and gestures known only to the underground cadres of the Communist Party."

Of course this means war with the puppet regime and the Japanese imperialists."The 'visitor' nodded. "You must be really busy then, Professor Jiang."Jiang let out a breath. "You're right, sir.

We're also planning to contact the resistance in Sichuan and notify them to stay prepared for the inevitable. I've been preparing to send them all the resources we have collected from Vietnam so far."\n\nWang took up the conversation. "We're also secretly conveying to Long Yun and the NPA that the CCP remnants are willing to fight under Long's banner with the same goal of China's liberation. Given the General's sympathy towards them and his familiarity with their higher-ups, this shouldn't take too much effort. Of course, there are always some things that can only be shared with the NPA once the situation is stabilized..."Jiang ended the discussion. "...but for now these will suffice."At that the 'visitor' smiled widely.\n\nSome days later, Jiang's guest was at the station.

In the days that followed, he started mobilizing the dissidents and supporters to be ready for the inevitable takeover once the coup happened. He also sent letters to the Sichuan resistance, advising them to prepare for their own share in the anti-Japanese revolt.\n\nFar in the south, in Viet Minh controlled territory, Ye Jianying is reading Jiang's letter. A wide smile crossed his face, and his hands shook with uncontrolled enthusiasm.\n\nDeciding to leave matters of mobilization to his staff, he and his two aides-de-camp, Yang Dezhi and Yang Chengwu, rushed to Kunming for the early preparations via the Kunming-Haiphong Railway. Not much was required in terms of preparations; Jiang had already prepared the necessary coverups and disguise for them to board the train and head north.\n\nBut Ye had one last thing to do before he left.

While there, he had met a CCP general and been appointed his secretary, and the two became close friends over the years. That man was Marshal Ye Jianying.\n\nAfter some more brief words - reminiscences, advice, so on - and one last drink of rice wine, Ye and Ho walked together to the train station undercover. Ho prevailed upon Ye to let him carry at least one of Ye's bags, as he had done back in the day. Though Ye was reticent at first given Ho's old age, he at last agreed and gave him the lightest bag he could find.\n\nAt last the two embraced and parted, Ho for his home and Ye for his seat in the train.\n\nAs the one got settled in his seat, and the other got back to his house, a single tear left each of their eyes."

Further, the largest backer of the Sichuan resistance - Liu Wenhui of Xikang - is being held back by his cowardly subordinates, who are refusing to join him in assisting the NPA and threatening a mutiny if they do so.\n\nBut it does not matter.

Or flitting from city to city, spreading the word of liberation and equality, preparing resistance networks for that one glorious day where China, slumbering and choked by the chains of the samurai and of collaboration, would free itself? Yes, she was indeed dangerous. But she was also a potential resource, they thought.\n\nWang Jingwei had perverted the image of the Kuomintang to the point of being beyond recognition, but he had still maintained a façade of tracing his government's lineage from her late husband's movement. As the wife to Dr. Sun, the Madame's approval would move mountains to advance the regime's legitimacy. In contrast, killing her would also sever that already-nonexistent link between the Father of the Nation and their rule. And so Wang - and Gao after him - had endeavored time after time to persuade and threaten their way into a statement in support of the government from her. Every time for twenty years, she had all but laughed in their faces. She had not bowed to the tyrant Chiang Kai-Shek, let alone an unabashed traitor to the nation and his imperial puppetmasters.\n\nThey had placed her in house arrest to neutralize her, but they would have been fools to believe she was powerless within the mansion's four thick walls. She still kept contact with the dissidents within and without the state apparatus, who still resisted the collaborators' rule. The pen would be her new saber in the battle for China.

She had stopped picking up the phone altogether; her other correspondence was all via telegram or letter, so it mattered little.\n\nShe squinted at the photos. Many had been captured during his time as Grand Marshal and leader of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou, but a few predated even Xinhai. Those were images of him as his true self: the revolutionary and idealist she had known. They all, though, were decades old, many blurred and distorted due to the primitive technologies of the time and the wearing of age.\n\nTo say Sun Yat-Sen was a great man would be a tremendous understatement. But, his ideas, like the photos, had faded and corrupted over the forty years since his death. The Kuomintang had moved far away from the revolutionary's original ideas and intentions. And though she detested the way they had fallen from grace, neither would she herself seek to stand solely in her husband's shadow. She had her own vision: one of equality and freedom for all under a China for the people and for the workers.

yun_zhengtong.13.desc:0 "The ringing of the telephone had been getting deafening over the past days. Nonetheless, Song Qingling ignored the constant calls while reading the morning paper, fresh off the presses and still warm to the touch. "YUNNAN AND GUIZHOU IN OPEN REVOLT", the front headline said in big, bold letters. She had been alerted of the fact by letter last night - surprising, as news of the events outside her gilded cage typically took a week to reach her.\n\nSong turned her head and glanced outside the broad window which sat behind her armchair. Faintly heard through the narrow crack was the sweet sound of resistance. It put a smile on her face to see the valorant protesters and dissidents who had dared to demonstrate in broad daylight. The crowd - there must have been thousands of people - carried placards and shouted slogans, demanding the government to cease collaboration and to reconcile with the rebels in the Southwest. Song was proud: this was her doing, after all. Though she could not identify the faces in the crowd, she knew many among them belonged to the dissident network she had cultivated from her office through naught but a pen and her aptitude for organization.\n\nAlas, the fleeting saccharine tune could only last so long; the Nanjing Police dispersed the crowd within an hour and a half. But the response had been dampened; resources had clearly been diverted to the war in the Southwest. Perhaps more significantly, it mattered not that the protest was broken up. They would be back, larger in numbers and louder than before. The spirit of defiance waits for no one and obeys neither the baton nor the water cannon. And she would do her part in assisting and organizing them. Song, for the first time in weeks, picked up her phone - she had a good many calls to make."

yun_zhengtong.14.desc:0 "The men arrived at her manor under the warm light of the late afternoon sun. Their uniforms were scrappy and stained, dirtied undoubtedly by the fighting they had to endure. "Madame Sun Yat-Sen, we hereby lift your imprisonment within this house. You are now a free woman." The commanding soldier's southwestern accent was unmistakable: he had marched alongside a ragtag army from Yunnan all this way to the capital. Song smiled and thanked them; then, with a swift salute and farewell, the battalion was gone.\n\nSong strolled for a while through the city she had glimpsed only in grainy pictures and snapshots through glass for decades. She cast her mind to 1937, standing in awe of a city transformed in totality from the wartorn citadel she had last seen in 1929. She felt the same now, looking upon rows of factories booming with the whir of machines, and miles of concrete offices and towers in every direction.\n\nWhile she walked, she thought of what lay ahead. The war was not over; already Japanese soldiers were flooding across the border. And division was already haunting the provisional coalition government: the old grudges between the KMT and CPC were resurfacing as old men's rivalries. But yet, she held out hope: the dissidents were holding it all together, keeping the front from falling apart. They were the key to a free China, she postulated.\n\nSoon, evening descended; Song had stopped at the banks of the Yangtze, where moonlight illuminated a shining, shimmering river. Couples waltzed and walked slowly on the promenade, protected by the watchful gaze of the heavens. The waters lapped and broke gently on the shore as Song looked across the mighty Yangtze to see thousands of specks of light reflected on its surface. But these were neither the stars nor galaxies afar: this was the light of industry, of a city alight and alive, of the electric spark and crackle that now drove the world. This was the light of modernity."

yun_zhengtong.15.desc:0 ""Dear Madam Song,\n\nI regret that you must receive this news, but the National Protection Army has failed. The Reorganized Government has captured Kunming, and what remains of the partisans and soldiers of the National Liberation Front has surrendered or vanished into the country."\n\nThe outcome of the Western Insurrection was disheartening, but Song Qingling had not been surprised by it. It was a long shot, after all, that a ragtag army from Yunnan would be able to march this far west and unseat the collaborators in Nanjing.\n\n"The devastation the war has left is indescribable. Stories have reached my office of infants bleeding out on mud streets, of villages aflame by incendiary shells, of soldiers of both sides dismembered and torn apart to ooze and rot on Guizhou's rolling hills. The photographs from the front have today arrived at my desk; they are not a pretty sight. I must confide in you: the sorrow I feel cannot be translated into the language of ink and characters."\n\nSong had known and seen war before. She was there when Chongqing fell and burned, as the desperate final pleas of a people were silenced by the boom of artillery pieces and blasts of machine gun fire. So why did her lungs choke and stomach plunge? Why did tears still well up in her eyes?\n\n"I must now go; the Southwestern provinces are on the verge of famine and I am needed to fundraise for their reconstruction. I look forward to your correspondence: perhaps it will give me a ray of light to hold onto. \n\nSincerely, Jiang Zemin"\n\nA tear weaved its way down the edges of her face. Song closed the letter and stood, blinking her eyes shut. She could not despair. To do so was to give up, to capitulate to the enemy. She had had her moment of grief. There was still work to be done. Resistance and the dream of liberation would not die with the NPA. It had been set back, it had been bruised, but it had not been extinguished. It must never die, lest China with it. She had to remember that."

yun_zhengtong.16.desc:0 "People of Free China! I'd like to speak today about the impossible challenges we have surmounted so far, and the hurdles ahead which we as a united nation must face. Some may know me as Madame Sun Yat-Sen. Tens of years ago, my husband set out the Three Principles of the People, which sat at the heart of his philosophy. Of these, one has been achieved: nationalism. From the Himalayas to Harbin, China is united, and China is free. Nevermore shall foreign powers and empires oppress us, whether they hail from Tokyo or from Europe. But what of the other two?"\n\n"Yes, our nation is free from the shackles of imperialism. But what does that matter if the people making up that nation are still not yet free - free to choose their leaders, free to participate in the process of democratic governance, free to speak their minds, free from political repression and censorship? What does our freedom matter if we become a repeat of the Chiang regime? And why should a man care about his freedom and liberties at all, if he is still poor and sick, if he is still hungry and wanting? If he sees opulence and modernity around him, but enjoys not the fruit of prosperity and wealth?"\n\n"Yet, even Dr. Sun did not go far enough, and certainly not for the China of today. We need a total reorganization and transformation of the country from the bottom up, a great revolution which will bring about an equitable society which provides for its citizens and a democratic society for the people. Only then can we call China fully free. So I call upon you: fight! Fight as fiercely as you did against the Japanese, not with bombs and bullets but with words and demonstration. Fight for our China, and dare to dream of a China for the people."\n\nThe audience's applause reverberated through the plaza in front of the Forbidden City, whose gates and pillars had been cracked and chipped by gunfire months ago. On the ground were several craters, too, the gifts of artillery shells. In a way, Song Qingling thought, the scene was much like China. The war - and the decades of oppression leading up to it - would leave its scar on the nation, perhaps forever. But as the holes in the palace walls were repaired, China too would heal, and her bleeding wounds close. And the Dissidents, the very movement she helped foster, would be the key, as she had thought. She could not be more proud of them."

But there was no other option: the caravan's jeeps and vehicles were packed with provisions and weapons, and she would hardly accept comfort while her comrades trekked on desolate earth.\n\nSong looked to her left. Just short of obfuscation by the horizon was the shore of the great Lake Qinghai, its cyan-azure waters an oasis in an ocean of tawny soil, sand, and stone disturbed only by the protrusions of hills and mountains and vast valleys where ground had been uprooted by the finger of some higher power. The twilight sun had begun to sink into the lake, casting a red-orange twinge on the calm surface. Night would soon fall, and they would make camp.\n\nShe turned to face the opposite direction. Somewhere far, far beyond that horizon was Nanjing, burning and destroyed once more, in the hands of the Japanese. But here, she could see only a vast sprawl of dunes and mist-shroud mounds. Song would not see the capital and the heartland again in her lifetime. Neither would many who walked the trail alongside her. But she did not despair. As the Workers' and Farmers' Army had done after Chongqing, she would fight on on these rolling hills and plateaus. The Japanese could not live forever, nor would the jackboot asphyxiate China for good. As is the fate of empire, they would stumble and fall. And one day, some of her younger companions - or perhaps their descendants, or their descendants' descendants  - would see Nanjing again."

Even though it was just a business trip, or so they say, he still felt somewhat obliged to "cherish" the rustling of Jingjiang's leaves and the screeching of tires against the asphalt ground after all those years away, to wonder how this bustling hometown of his had even survived the nightmare two decades and more ago. Then again, he supposed "nightmare" was a nice enough euphemism for reality. Nanjing stood, after all, barely two hundred kilometers away.\n\nLiu Yiliang smirked, yet his throat clenched. If the War had been a nightmare, then indeed he'd never woken up, the only difference being that his weapon was now a fountain pen instead of a rifle. Far too often he had cried out in the headings, into the dark, for whoever was out there to wake up and see the absurdity of it all - Japanese marionettes, atop the Presidential Palace - and far too often he'd had to silence himself with the ink from his own bottle. Far too often the boys back in Chongqing had told him, with trembling voices and drenched foreheads, that this was for the good as much of himself as of their journal, and far too often he'd had to stifle a laugh. The New Sichuan Daily used to pride itself on responsibility, on actually having a spine in the face of decadence. Where did it all go?\n\nThe feeling was clinging to his trachea again, the feeling of suffocation. The smothered voices, the hollowness beneath the state-sponsored loudspeakers and the pan-Asian banners, all testaments to one undeniable, unconcealable truth - China was not free, far from it, and it remains a part to play for Liu, and what few like-minded compatriots out there, to make her so. It was why he had relocated to Chongqing, in fact - to reconnect with them, to dedicate his life to anything that wasn't Wang Jingwei's propaganda machine.\n\nLiu's footsteps were picking up pace once more, for his path lay still ahead. There remained ears to talk to, until one day, hopefully, China would finally make herself heard."

It falls upon him to open his own eyes, seek out his own shackles, shatter them upon the monoliths of justice and equity and thus attain liberation for himself and his brethren."\n\nLiu Yiliang froze his hand, placed the fountain pen back into the bottle, and grasped the paper closer to his bespectacled face as he inspected the still-wet paragraph. The opening sentence would have to be more evocative. Maybe add "the only difference is that his shackles now have a way of concealing themselves" somewhere. More crucially, however, the Chinese-in-chains rhetoric was simply too overused at this point. Liu let out an exhausted chuckle. Perfection in the trade of journalism was, indeed, a myth, not an attainable possibility. His pals in the Minmeng might critique this to shreds, for sure, but it'd be more than welcome; he needed every pair of literate eyes on his newest op-ed, as they always did, to see to it that it would set out to do exactly what it was supposed to.\n\nTo reach out to whoever out there that could read and was still reading, and sound the bugle in their hearts. To knock it into them that Tokyo and Nanjing were co-conspirators in tyranny, that all their promises and ramblings about pan-Asian fraternity are but one big, cruel joke.\n\nStifling yet another yawn, he turned towards his left wrist, the tick-tock of his watch punctuating the silent Chongqing midnight. In seventeen minutes, the Xianghe Grocery Store two blocks down the street would be "open for business". In twenty-four, the backdoor in the alleyway would swing open. All Liu had to do then was to step into its shadowy embrace, deposit the envelope, and let the pipeline work its magic. Then, his ammunition, his latest contribution to China's underground free press, shall be delivered to the right hands."

You wouldn't dare if you care even one bit about your own life-"\n\n"I care about what's happening right now, on the ground." Liu felt his own voice booming across the desk, crashing upon his Editor-in-Chief. "The craters. The blown-up roads and pipes. The people left without a home to return to. This is war we're talking about, sir - war, right at our doorsteps, and I just don't see why everyone here is acting like it's nothing."\n\n"Because it is nothing and you are throwing your life away for nothing!" With a slam of the desk Qian darted to his feet. "Literally another month and it'll all be over, Liu Yiliang, and I will not let the whole New Sichuan Daily get in trouble just because some moron wants to kill himself in the meantime!" He grabbed and shook Liu by the collar. "Your dumbass knows full well Long Yun's dying to blow your brains all over the cabin walls before you even take a step off the plane. How the hell are we supposed to explain it to the Nanjing people if they find you lying a ditch-"\n\n"Tell them I chose this fate on my own." The voice poured out of Liu's mouth, unwavering. "Perhaps, though, you'd want to keep the explanation for the men in the NPA - tomorrow Chongqing could switch hands for all I know. I don't know about you, sir, but I refuse to turn a blind eye to the shifting tides of history."\n\nThe grip loosened. For a few seconds silence filled the room, before Qian, with a resigned sigh, capitulated. "Warehouse is always open." He took out his pen. "Go grab the films, that old camera of yours, anything you can take. You brought this upon yourself; don't say I didn't warn you.""

The sun was emerging from the other side now, the spires and clocktowers of the Bund basking in its warmth, and in the sweet embrace of tranquility that had followed Liu and his travel mates into the city barely hours ago.\n\nUnlike what Qian, or anyone else in Chongqing for that matter, would happily claim, the National Protection Army was no hive of dogs. It was a band of true men, like none other than Yao here behind him; a growing, gleaming pyre of valorous souls, burning with only the purest of intentions for the Chinese nation. Liu had witnessed it all, as did the lens of his trusty camera. Every peasant, every bandit they met, every dialect they heard along the way from the Sichuan Basin to the East China Sea swirled and converged into one simple, resounding message: a good fight was being fought. And today, it was won.\n\nGreeting his ears, as he and his companion stood without a word in the early morning bliss, were only the singing of seabirds and the tender crash of waves against the shore, heralding the dawn that had become reality. Gao Zongwu was dead, and so was his government-on-strings and his pawns in the media; with them, any remaining obligation Liu might've had to the New Sichuan Daily. It was among these spires and clocktowers by the Huangpu River, at the beating heart of urban China, that he would erect a new bastion, his new bastion, of untainted press freedom; there, all the films, tapes, and battle plans stuffed away in his suitcase shall melt into letterpress blocks and radio waves, coursing into the veins of every last free Chinese standing on this soil.\n\nFor the War of Resistance is not yet over; and starting today, Liu Yiliang takes his part in the lead."

The shutter of his camera fluttered open and close without care, its clatterings melting into the crackling of flames all around. SNAP. That spire was on fire. SNAP. That pond was in a crimson red. SNAP. Those pavilions were nothing more than rubble. Scene after haunting scene flashed onto his trembling pupils, as they did onto the camera's dust-laden lens. So this was what was left of Kunming, he thought. Of what could have been.\n\nThe nightmare had returned, triumphant, bearing its blood-drenched teeth; in fact, it never left.\n\nHe tried to stand, but his legs gave out, sending him crashing back onto the heaps of rock beneath. The Second Northern Expedition was over. Not in victory, but in disaster. In tragedy. In bombardment after ceaseless bombardment upon the city and the thousands of corpses lining its streets, mangled by shells or charred by fire, and Liu was lucky he wasn't among them. In two days, the vultures from Nanjing would swoop in and dine; in five days, the trucks, the loudspeakers, the all-too-familiar yellow banners spouting peace and reconstruction and all the other bullshit. In thirty days, at most, whatever traces of a free China would be gone, painted over by Wang Jingwei's hideous face once again.\n\nLiu smirked, yet his eyeballs moistened, the familiar grip of suffocation clenching his throat. Was it ever meant to be, the freedom he so craved and China so deserved? Was his career, his reason for existence, chained forever to silence and servitude? The nightmare was grinning, jeering, closing in on him. He screwed his eyelids shut-\n\nThen, he saw the rest of Kunming's men, women, and children, their gaze intertwined with his.\n\nHe saw the spark in their eyes."

Liu Yiliang, the host, gazed through the curtains into the horizon; and as the colorful fireworks blossomed upon the Huangpu River, his heart did, too. Unknowingly, a smile crept onto his lips.\n\nFor what was not to celebrate? He had broken from old acquaintances and made new ones, a few of whom had, in fact, joined him on this very occasion tonight. His day-and-night coverage of war, of people, of the brave and righteous fighters of the NPA had earned him more than enough prestige and respect within the media industry, and the silent yet resolute approval of all who lay down everything for today's new Republic, civilian, soldier, and politician alike. For once, the nightmare was no more, fading into a distant memory. For once, Liu could finally rest, content, and say he'd done enough.\n\nBut was it?\n\nHis companions were coming up the stairs now, giggling, question after question tumbling out of their mouths. So what to do next, Yiliang, they asked. Settle down in Shanghai? Or go on an adventure in the Khingan Range or something?\n\nRun for an office, I think. The words flowed from his lips, unprompted, taking him by surprise. Do my part, even if I know I'm just a journalist. See to it that democracy stays in China. See to it our victory won't be in vain.\n\nHe could already hear the snickering, but it mattered no more. He could no longer ignore the calling in his heart.

The façade woven together by the departing mountains, at least, told him as much.\n\nAlmost as if there was still a China behind.\n\nThe ocean breeze howled against his cheeks, yet he felt nothing. He'd given all his heart away, after all. He'd hoped. He'd dreamed. For China to stand a chance, like the swaddled toddler he was. For victory and freedom, only for Japanese shells and Japanese boots to tear those lofty fantasies into flying shreds. Over and over, until the day the New China Daily people had stuffed a stamped U.S. passport and a wrinkled merchant ship ticket into his hands. Then, he'd woken up, and saw it all. Reality. From now on, no more freedom of press would exist on this side of the Pacific. No more freedom of anything at all, for as long as the Rising Sun still shines.\n\nSomething was welling in Liu's eyelids, but the aching in his heart screwed them shut. The course of action was clear - he would return to work the moment he stepped on American soil. Pick up his pen again. Ring Washington, Ottawa, every last free nation of the world that could and would bring down the Co-Prosperity Sphere for good, and only then would China have the hope, any hope, of being whole again. It didn't matter if it would take ten years, twenty, or thirty. It didn't matter if he wouldn't live to see the day.

On the vines and their adorning leaves he saw the droplets of mildew and condensation mix and combine and split and race down, dropping off, touching the ground with a sound so slight you could only hear it when you stared at it, before the drops arrived on the leaf again, and began the eternal cycle anew. The scratch on the window he had to see nature from seemed part of the world itself by now - perhaps a gentle, integral change in nature's appearance? Perhaps a rift in the world? The house was his world, after all, and his years in it had started to make every imperfection magnified ten thousand fold, until a bend in a needle head would become a crack in his home's foundation.\n\nHe turned to the letters. The home was not a battlefield - his home, at least, was spared from the marks of war - but a general has no need for a battlefield. Even a battle is optional. What he needs is men.

But you do not treat a man as a friend when you deliver bad news, even if he is supposed to pretend it's good news.\n\nWhen Cao handed the letter containing news wordlessly to Zhang, Zhang knew in a single instant the result of the Western Insurrection. Starting his reading of the letter already sad, it made the impact lessened, though not absent. It went as Cao's body language already told him. A total defeat, the rebellion cast apart. It was a disappointing piece of news. Was victory likely? No. But it was in the realm of possibility, the same home that hope lives inside. But Zhang forgot that he was stuck in a different home than hope's.\n\nHe turned and went wordlessly to the study. There would be something to write, he just had to figure out what. Something for the future. Some new plans. Some new opportunities."

yun_zhengtong.30.desc:0 "It was strange to see the Japanese leave Nanjing. There wasn't a soul who could forget the day they came. The blood in the streets, the massacres, and the other crimes wrought upon the people here. It was a black stain in history to begin a kind of new world for the Chinese. But the world ends with a whimper, not with a bang, and the Japanese order departed with somber faces onto crowded boats.\n\nThe streets, and those within, pelted the Japanese with insults, fruit, and less savory things. It could be said that nobody could see a single one of their faces move, their eyes pointed down, protected by the shadow of their caps, hiding their defeat. Now, Zhang Xueliang was never one to go with the whims of the Japanese, and could always make sure that he had his distinctions from them, and that certainly was not going to stop now. With a little bit of wine - but not too much - and a cheer, he made his way to the train station to buy a ticket home.\n\nThe train's swaying was gentle, and though the more luxury liner he had managed to depart on had tried to hide the train's movement for a smooth ride, he did not mind it much. Over the hours and hours of the trip, he saw the landscape change, departing the Yangtze Delta, endless civilization, to the North, where everything changed. Zhang saw grasses disappear and fewer homes and the rest stops had employees colder to him. And it was beautiful, and it was home.\n\nThe Young Marshal had been increasingly misnamed every year. With victory, there was no more point in being a marshal, and with half the name gone, he may as well admit the other half was gone too. He was old, and he was going to live the life that the old dream."

Their clothes were covered in mud, and Zhang's rifle had been split in half by the shrapnel of a near-miss shell. Their bodies were covered in small wounds of which not a single one had a memorable source, the blood blending into one messy retreat.\n\nThe army had been shattered, and they had run to the wilds. Even here, in their homeland, in the places least touched by the human hand, they knew they could not outrun the Japanese. Yang Hucheng knew this.\n\n"We can still choose how we die," Yang said. "Run, friend, and die older than I. I'm a big enough victory of capture to distract them for a while."\n\nZhang looked his friend in the eye. He considered for a moment if he should take up the offer, and make that his last look of a lifelong friend. But he decided that a lifelong friend means a lifelong friend, and this means beginning, and this means end. "No." His answer felt too terse. He had to add more. "We die like any other. We have spare uniforms of the lower ranks." Yang's eyes perked up. Zhang continued, "Some don't even have bullet holes in them. We die as the soldiers we have to be, and no more."\n\nYang looked at the floor of the forest he would have an unceremonious grave in. "Not unarmed you're not," Yang said. He withdrew a pistol from his holster, and handed it to Zhang. He smiled, and grabbed it.\n\nTwo friends stand in the woods. They wonder how many soldiers they can take down with them. For a moment of hope they wonder if they will survive. They dispel the hope, as that makes the battle harder, and more painful. They are here to die, and in dying will live for a final time."

yun_zhengtong.32.desc:0 "The woods were silent, as they always were. That was why Sun Liren always came here to run for exercise, for it was a peaceful sort of silence, entirely unlike the country that supposedly ruled over these woods. Of course, more important than the background of his runs was that he should consistently run- it not only kept the physical body and fighting spirit in order, it most importantly instilled discipline. Discipline was something that no soldier, from the young to the old, could afford to miss out on. That was a lesson Sun had learned many times, too often the hard way.\n\nUnlike many of his fellow generals of the National Revolutionary Army, Sun had not been faced with the choice of joining the collaborating puppet government or being imprisoned. Rather, Nanjing seemed to have contented itself with a sort of internal exile to the province of Guangxi- although their actual control in the province was loose at the best of times. Sun still did what he could to keep his end of the bargain and avoided stirring up unrest against the national government. After all, he didn't have to, when Nanjing did that themselves through their corruption and incompetence. If only he could straighten them out, with the same exacting discipline he had once expected from his soldiers, then perhaps life for the average person wouldn't be so unbearable.\n\nNo matter. The Chinese people would seek justice one day, with or without the support of their government. For that reason, Sun had to stay in shape and continue to learn the latest military theories; should he one day be expected to help once more in China's fight for freedom, he had to do everything he could towards achieving that end."

yun_zhengtong.33.desc:0 "It had been an ordinary day like any other for Sun Liren, with a healthy run through the woods supplemented by much other exercise. This had been his daily life for over a decade, and even if the winds of change had begun to blow in China, Sun had not thought this wind would reach him so soon. Arriving back at his house upon the completion of his exercise, he found a single letter left at his door. That itself was curious enough; when Nanjing wanted something from him, as it rarely did, it always sent someone to meet him in person. Whoever had left this letter did not want to be overheard.\n\nAfter glancing from side to side, Sun picked up the letter and swiftly went into his home, shutting the door firmly behind him. Opening the envelope gingerly, he took the letter out and unfolded it, letting the envelope fall to the ground as he did so. The first thing that came to his attention was impossible to miss, a name that had for decades ranked among those most reviled by the Japanese: Zhang Xueliang. Though Sun had regrettably only ever been an acquaintance of Marshal Zhang, he had heard well enough of his fate after the war: a continuation of the house arrest that Chiang had given him, to be confined without trial until the end of his life. Sun never had known why Zhang seemed to have gotten off relatively lightly; then again, perhaps the Japanese thought the worst punishment the Marshal could suffer would be seeing the ruination they had brought upon China.\n\nEncouraged by the sight of the name of such a respectable man, Sun began to read the letter. In short, the letter was nothing short of an invitation to treason, with a request for Sun's advice on whether or not an open rebellion against a government betraying its own people is wise. Though the Nanjing government is never mentioned by name in the letter, its meaning is clear enough, with many references to the justice faced by famous traitors of Chinese history.\n\nSun would be a lesser man if he did not answer in the affirmative."

For once excusing himself from the performance of his usual exercise routine, Sun had first bathed and then donned the old uniform for the first time in too many years. Though it no longer was as fitting as it once was, Sun supposed even the most strenuous of exercise could not halt the inexorable march of time. After gathering those belongings he could easily carry, Sun mounted his horse and began a long ride to the west, in the direction of Yunnan.\n\nYunnan, always a proud province, and now the center of a great insurrection that aimed to throw out the Japanese and reclaim China, under the leadership of the always clever warlord Long Yun. Old as Sun might be getting, Long Yun is even older, a generation separating the two of them. For a moment, Sun wonders if this might inhibit the man's leadership, but he turns away such thoughts. He is becoming an old man himself, yet neither of them can afford to let that be to the benefit of Japan, even in the slightest. There is simply too much at stake."

yun_zhengtong.35.desc:0 "Having been fortunate enough to have been given command of the victorious parade that now marched through Nanjing, Sun Liren waved to cheering crowds, made up of the long oppressed people of the city come to greet their liberators. However, he cannot help being troubled by the reason for his being given command of the victory parade: Long Yun's advanced age had begun to catch up to him, and he had fallen ill, with Sun appointed as his replacement in the parade. They would not be able to keep the people from noticing the absence of the leader of the so far victorious anti-Japanese insurrection; Sun only hoped this would not diminish the people's enthusiasm much.\n\nThis aside, the parade itself had been a tremendous organizational success, with sections reserved for the NPA, KMT, and even the communists, who had been welcomed by the bulk of the anti-Japanese movement. This even included, to the surprise of many, many KMT leaders, whose longstanding enmity with the Communist Party had not vanished, but had been put aside in favor of the hatred for Japanese injustices that united them all. Sun Liren numbered among these leaders, for while he possessed no love for the communists, he still could recognize that they possessed not the slightest amount less righteous fury against Tokyo than he did. \n\nDespite all this success coming seemingly unendingly, Sun did not dare to let himself forget: they had dealt with the hanjian, but the invaders remained very much ready to strike back against the people they had once exploited. They were ready for war; Sun could not let himself be any less prepared. He would maintain not only his own discipline, but that of all of China's soldiers, as he had always strived to do."

Even if the insurrection in Yunnan had ultimately met with failure, it had proven that the traitors could be beaten and scattered in open battle. During their journey to the west to regroup, the group of KMT soldiers led by Sun had come across soldiers led by a certain man Sun had never thought he'd see again: Jiang Jingguo, son of the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek. Now, as their now united group stopped to rest on their long march, Sun and Jiang Jingguo had tea together to catch up. "It's been too long, hasn't it?" Sun smiled at the younger man, no longer the bright young officer he had known before the war and now a wiser middle aged man. Time had really caught up to them all. "It is unfortunate that we meet again in these circumstances, and not in Nanjing, but we will both be there again one day, I am certain."\n\nWhen Jiang replied, his words were hard yet determined, without the slightest trace of fear in them. "As am I." Jiang agreed. "I only regret that whenever we return, it will not be as soon as it should be."\n\n"Yes, that is one of the greatest burdens upon my heart." Sun said softly, yet with a smile. "Though that day may be closer than you might think." At Jiang's curious expression, Sun continued. "Already there are movements working to take down the traitors from inside their own territory. The most significant of these movements include young dissidents, who work to collapse the Nanjing government through public pressure and unrest, as well as the infiltration and sabotage conducted by the communists." Sun noted that Jiang clicked his tongue at the last word. The man had practically inherited his father's hatred of the communist movement.\n\nConsidering Sun's words, Jiang quietly sipped his tea, clearly intrigued by what he had learned. "I see...""

They sat together on a balcony overlooking Nanjing, as the sun in the sky over the city began to set. The war was won, the invaders were repulsed and forced out, and now there was peace ahead of them. "I suppose there wasn't much point in me sending that letter to you after all, was there? Before Marshal Long rose up, I mean." Zhang remarked, with a hint of wistfulness to his voice. "It seems others had the courage to free China before either of us could."\n\n"No, I wouldn't say that." Sun replied, to a raised eyebrow from Zhang. "Your letter removed any hesitation I had about joining the uprising. In truth, I owe you my deepest gratitude for sending it to me.\n\nThat made Zhang smile, with a genuine quality to it that made him for once less admired hero and more human. "I see... I'm glad, then." After a moment passed, Zhang turned to face Sun, his eyes both gentle and tired. "As soon as possible, I plan to retire and return home to Dongbei, now that I'm able to. Once I've gone, I want you to replace me as commanding officer of the National Revolutionary Army. I think, with you there to keep it disciplined, there can be little worry of it threatening the lawful government. Can you do that for me, General Sun?"\n\nThere was no personal ambition in Sun's heart when hearing Zhang's request, yet even so, there was only one answer. "Yes, of course, Marshal Zhang. I will carry out this last request of yours, despite our disagreements, because I believe you have China's best interests at heart. Have a safe retirement." Zhang thanked Sun, genuine gratitude passing between the two old men who had seen far too much evil in their lives. Then, Zhang left to pack his belongings for his journey, and bid Sun farewell."

It did not matter that the war was lost, that the ruination China now faced was even greater than before. Men had to face death with dignity; otherwise, they could hardly be considered alive.\n\nHe already knew the Japanese soldiers approached his current home in Chaohu, Anhui. It was where he had been born, far removed from Guangxi where he had long resided, yet it was home now nevertheless. It would be where he met the enemy, and gave them the farewell they deserved.\n\nAfter finishing a thorough bath, Sun dressed himself in his cleanest National Revolutionary Army uniform, and gave his finest salute to the mirror. A shame that there was none left in the world to witness it, but there was no helping it. Even so, he liked to imagine the Generalissimo watched on with approval from the heavens. A knock came at his door, along with orders in accented Chinese to open up, and Sun turned with a resigned sigh. His time had come. Grabbing the rifle that had served him well from the day he had joined the insurrection, which had come so close to victory yet had fallen so far, he loaded his rifle as they knocked again and the commands became harsher and more aggressive. Then, Sun threw open his door, and greeted his killers with gunfire."

The Northwestern deserts sprawled before him. dunes jutted out of the ground, sagging under the feather-like motion of the air. Jiang Jingguo unscrewed the cap of his canteen, before taking a deep drink. He squinted, and raised his binoculars to level with his eyes. On a map unfolded before him, he marked areas where ambushes might be possible, areas of shade under the sun, and hiding spots to help troops hide from Japanese patrols.\n\nHui scouts dispatched by the Ma were probably more effective than he would be. As the son of the late generalissimo, he didn't have to do any of this. Ma Jiyuan looked at him incredulously when he first requested scout work.\n\nHowever, a man needs time from himself on occasion. Field work was an excuse: he wanted a quiet place to meditate, to contemplate events of the past and the future. The Mas were friendly enough: loyal Chinese nationalists to the core, whose personal emblem was the white sun on the blue sky. Yet, huddled in the camp amongst the din and noise of soldiers returning, departing, living, and dying, Jiang could not find himself the space needed to sit down and think.\n\nNow, alone with the dunes of sand and the sharp, jagged shadows of rock formations, Jiang took a cigarette out and lit it. Sighing as he sucked in the fumes of the tobacco, he began to think and reminisce. Lost father, lost brother. He was not there for Chongqing, and Weiguo was nowhere to be found. Thoughts of his brother tugged at Jiang's mind. Had Weiguo known? The old generalissimo hid things from the younger of the two siblings, secrets that would surely shatter the brotherhood fostered under the house of Jiang.\n\nHe shook his head. Jiang would tell Weiguo when the time was right. Assuming, of course, that they would live to see each other again."

The flap of the command tent was ajar, letting a single blade of light bleed into the room, casting shadows over the rugged, carpeted interior. Between Ma and Jiang was a small, low table. The cups of tea on it cast faint wisps of steam into the air.\n\nMa Jiyuan grinned. War was the Ma family's natural occupation, and twenty years of conventional and guerilla warfare has honed that love into a professional art. "This is good news!" he said, barely containing the excitement he felt at the news. "The Mas are in full support of this insurrection."\n\nJiang's response, however, was more muted. Though he received the news with the same joy, his heart felt trepidation at the thought of joining the war outright at this stage.. He looked at Ma Jiyuan. "It is indeed good news," he said to the messenger. "And you have done the admirable work of crossing the deserts under full view of the Japanese. I am thankful, however," clasping his hands, he sighed. "I have matters of state to discuss with General Ma. Leave us, if you please." The messenger bowed and turned to leave.\n\n"I know what you are going to say, young Jiang," the Ma general said, regarding Jingguo with utter seriousness. "But the Mas are powerful. If we rally the family we can break through that bastard Tsuji's lines and rendezvous with the insurrection. Give us the order, and we will move heaven and earth to fulfil it."\n\nJiang smirked, resisting the impulse to chuckle. "I command no one in this army, General. You know this better than most." he said, putting his fingers on the low table as if to enunciate his words. "However, I would like us to exercise caution. We have fought the Japanese for twenty years, and to throw away our struggle for an uncertain chance at victory would demean the memory of the generalissimo and those who died before him."\n\nMa Jiyuan fell silent. "Perhaps." He stood up to leave through the flaps of the tent. "I mean no insult to the memory of your father, but I think that it is best that we take action now.""

The moon, round and bright, held itself among the celestial beings, reflecting the sun's dignity on its face. Jiang sat himself on the cold desert sands, and watched the mysteries of the universe unfold before his eyes. A case of cold rice wine was next to him, and from time to time he would take swigs of it.\n\nThe alcohol burned its way through Jiang's chest. Good drink for stargazing. He was doing "field work" again, and this time he went west, deeper into the desert, rather than east. Where the dunes had sagged under the curtain of simmering air, now they stood like mounds: graves to mark where civilization had risen and fallen. Jiang blinked. China had stood for thousands of years. Although it would last for a thousand years more, one day he and the millions that comprised a stolid, respectable people would all turn to dust, with mounds of sand being all that remained: an unmarked grave for a forgotten nation.\n\nHe chuckled. It's too late to become a philosophical drunk, he thought. Jiang turned his mind to more practical matters. In the Southwest, rebellion was in full swing. Caught between advising caution and his own desire to join the insurrection, he nevertheless became adamant in his insistence to wait and see. Ma Jiyuan and the rest of his family were impatient, but the loyalty to the generalissimo and his family triumphed over everything else. The Mas would stay their hand, and wait.\n\nSoon, he would be called to do his duty as a son and a brother. Slightly drunk, he would rather not think of it all. Jiang stood and walked to his tent."

It's not been used very often in the past." He waves them inside, past the foyer and into the main living room. Jiang ordered the servant to prepare tea and snacks for the two generals. The room was well-lit, with lightbulbs mounted on chandeliers providing illumination. There were signs of work all over: the unfinished, torn-down plaster, the faint smell of wet concrete and paint, but it was comfortable enough for the three men.\n\nOnce tea and snacks were served, the conversation that commenced was in classic Chinese fashion: debating the finer points of Confucian doctrine, drawing comparisons between Prince Han Fei's doctrine and that of old Mozi's, flowing out into the broad banks of modern politics. Inevitably, their attention turned to the Communists and the Dissidents.\n\n"I admit," Li said, putting his cup of tea down, "China has changed so much. You have the Communists, and now these Dissidents around town. These people are so different from us, the old guards, that I don't know how to appraise them."\n\n"What do you think of their spirits?" Jiang said. The question was barbed in more ways than one. The old generalissimo was a staunch opponent of communism. The three men fell silent, sipping their tea in the awkward quiet.\n\n"I think that they have their hearts set in the right place," Song said, breaking the ice. "I have never spoken too much to any of them, but I think that they're all right."\n\n"Is that so?" Jiang said, pouring more tea into his cup. He did not touch it, however. Instead, he looked at the two men. "Whatever your opinions are, I require you to cooperate with the new politicians and the communists." Li rose to provide dissent, but a swift gesture of the hand extinguished that fire. "For now. I am not like my father. I know that for liberation to be achieved, China must be united again."

The Western Insurrection, as it was called, had been put down, and these soldiers no longer had a place to go. A man stood out from among the rest, riding a horse towards the encampment. It was Song Xilian, one of the rebel generals that had prosecuted the war. Jiang could not remember the last time he had seen Song. In the meantime, the man had aged. From this distance it seemed that his will to fight had been broken, and his uniform was stained by blood and sweat.\n\nWhen the rebel general arrived at Jiang's tent, he knelt before Jiang. "Forgive this humble servant," he said, "I have failed you and your father. I have wasted thousands of lives in a futile fight. The rebellion had been a failure, and due to my rash judgement, lives were lost. Please," he beseeched Jiang, "find a punishment suitable for this crime."\n\nJiang stared wide-eyed at the rebel general. He rose from his seat and touched Song's shoulders. "You did nothing wrong. Now stand up." Jiang helped Song on his feet. "There." he slapped the general's shoulders. "China owes much for what you have done, and to punish her sons for doing their duty - even if they fail - does not seem just to me." He returned to his seat and gestured for the soldiers to bring in the tea and cakes. "You have failed, that much is true," he said, settling in his chair. "But not even courageous generals can always defeat the odds.\n\n"Sir," Song began, but Jiang stopped it with an exasperated wave of his hand.\n\n"I am not the commanding general of this army."

His cheeks were shrunken, and eyebags dug trenches around his eyes, the scene of long battles against nightmares. He grinned. "Let's go, we'll have some tea."\n\nThey walked through the avenues of Nanjing, admiring the spring blossoms that fell in feather-like swaying motions. The Yangzi thrummed past the rows of houses, and the beating of its heart was China's own. Ferries, riverboat-container vessels, and sampans plied the waters, bringing goods from the inland provinces out into the commercial world. The sight reminds Jingguo of his own house: the torn, incomplete plaster, and the smell of fresh, wet paint, but also the liveliness, the happiness.\n\nSomewhere along the way, Jingguo became aware that his brother had stopped in his tracks, not following him. He turned, gently, towards his brother. "What's the matter?" He said, attempting to be gentle and understanding. The truth whispered in his mind. He shook it off.\n\n"All of this..." Weiguo said, looking at the scenes that surrounded him, "is not for me." He looked at Jingguo, eyes moist as if to let rivers fall. "The world has changed so much since they jailed me. If it's alright with you, brother, I would rather just get on with work."\n\nJingguo nodded, and touched his brother's shoulders. "That's all right."

The moon was absent today, and the sun was silent. In the cold Qinghai desert, the men guided themselves using the stars. Failing that, many kept oil lamps and flashlights,\n\nA shadow crept through the terrain. The men rubbed out their oil lamps and switched off their flashlights. An antelope cantered through the dunes, lost. Although its horns lost their shapes to the gloom, the sight mesmerized the men. Such an animal, so far from its grazing spots on the Tibetan plateaus, seemed to speak for all of them. Jiang thought of his brother, Weiguo, who remained in Nanjing to oversee the defense.\n\n"Go!" his brother had said, his voice rejecting any notion of argumentation, "we will hold this city, and then I will rejoin you."\n\nIt has been a few weeks since then, and there was no news. He wondered where Weiguo was, and whether he was still alive. The winds whispered sharp whistles through the dunes and the antelope groaned, before running away across the dunes.\n\nThey lit their lamps again, continuing their journey.

Chiang was again in that city. The city of his father's last stand. Ahead, screams in Japanese. "Banzai!" Then came the susurrating reply: "Banzai!" It crashed through the narrow streets of Chongqing, bloodied by warfare, like waves frothing against the coast. Up above, columns of smoke upheld the azure sky. He squinted at the sun, and let its rays bore a hole in his eyes, black as an eclipse.\n\nThey took him to the outskirts of the city, past the ruined walls and breached gates caked by drying blood. A shiver went through him. Above the gatehouses the Japanese had hung the bodies of the officers that had resisted to the bitter end. Among them was his father's. Tears streaked his face, and anger raked his heart. No! He wanted to scream. No. Next to him was the alleged body of Mao. The resemblance was there: the receding hairline, and the Hunanese tones of the skin, pale now as death cast its pall over the body. It didn't matter, he supposed. Alive, Mao was a most tenacious adversary. In death, strung up next to his father, he was a hero like none other.\n\nNausea struck him, and he had to sit down. He perched above a rock, panting. A Japanese officer sidled up to him and offered an apologetic smile.\n\n"What an end," the officer said. "Eh?" The Mandarin was laced with an accent. It carried notes of the Banzais of before. He gave the officer a look. Pursing his lips, he thought of words. He thought of responses. In the end, he remained silent. In the distance, a bomb exploded to the cheering of soldiers. Above it all, Above it all, there was a demonic rattling in the sky, in the walls, everywhere...\n\n"General!" A voice thundered in front of him. "General!" The guard rattled his prison cell. "A message for you." He left a sheaf of paper on the floor, and walked away. Jiang Weiguo rose up, and read the letter."

yun_zhengtong.47.desc:0 "One, two, three, four. Since Chongqing, Jiang Weiguo's life had revolved around these numbers, and to count them for himself was a succor to his fading, crumbling self. He laid prone on the concrete floor, sometime after labor hours. The cold alloy of cement rose to meet the heat of his body, and his extremities tingled with an electric expectation. He slid his palms under his figure and began to slowly push up against gravity. One, two, three, four.\n\nIt had been twenty years since Jiang's capture, and he was no longer a young man. As he did his count, the generalissimo's son became acutely aware of his age. His joints and fingers cracked at the first sign of pressure. His back bothered him the most. Despite daily exercise, it rose with an acerbic retort to the pressure exerted by the rest of the body. Soon, Jiang was panting, exhausted despite himself.\n\nHe stood, and looked at the tiny sliver of light at the back of his prison cell. Leveraging himself on the grates, he pulled himself up to look at the coast of Zhejiang. The sun was setting, out west. The waves frothed with foam. The eastern sea lost the reddish blush that overlaid its surface, little by little as the day surrendered to night. The stars began to scatter in the skies above. The smell of brine brought memories of home to Jiang. It was beauty seen through a slit in the door of a stranger's home, glimpsed one frame at a time.\n\nJiang let go of the grates and landed on his feet. He laid prone and began his push-ups again."

yun_zhengtong.48.desc:0 "It was Austria, March 1938.\n\nThe cold winds whispered through the trees, and trees, stripped of their leaves, laid themselves on the sides of the road. He could think of no reason why he was here again, encased in a tank. His hands felt for the cuffs and insignia of his rank. Wehrmacht, Fähnrich - that would be sergeant-candidate. He remembered. Kriegsschule, out of the officer school and straight into Austria. Blinking, he looked at the men around him. "Where are we?" he said, tapping the shoulders of the radio operative. "In Austria, I mean." he added, noticing the weird looks the crew were giving him.\n\n"Not far from the border," the driver said. "Austrian soldiers opened the way a few klicks back."\n\n"No resistance?"\n\n"Nil."\n\n"All right." He rose from his seat. "I am opening the hatch. I am going to take a look." With a rasp, the hatch swung open. The breeze stirred the loose hairs hanging from under his cap, and it blew whispers in his ears. He shivered. Even after spending four years studying in Germany, he could not get used to European colds. The skies were overcast, but no snow had been forthcoming since the morning. He sighed, and a puff of warmth bristled the air before fading away.\n\nThe scene shifted. Humidity ladened the air. The quiet Austrian countryside transformed before him. Bodies padded the ground, lying in pools of their blood. His crew attempted to get him back into the tank, but their voices became lost as the breeze screeched with the screams of men and the bursting of shells. A hurricane formed ahead, shifting the sands of this place. A few grains struck his eyes. Far ahead, an anti-tank gun boomed. Its discharge slammed into his tank, and the world rang, rang, and rang...\n\nJiang Weiguo opened his eyes and sat up. The prison bells were ringing."

yun_zhengtong.49.desc:0 ""Where is the armory?" Jiang said, his voice booming, echoing in the warden's office. "I will not ask again." The room was sparse, and the linoleum yellow wall caught the solitary neon light's glow. Outside, through the window, the cliffs and hills of Zhejiang were sharp silhouettes against the stars. Though it took almost a day, the breakout had been a success. Three out of the dozen prison guards who switched sides during the battle surrounded the two men. They had tied the warden to a chair earlier. Those who did not surrender, Jiang ordered them shot.\n\n"Master Jiang," the warden said, his tone relaxed. Mocking, even. "I told you, this prison has no cache of arms other than," he eyed Jiang's pistol. "What you have acquired for yourself." Jiang smirked, parrying the warden's mirth with his good humor.\n\n"Warden Hu, with all due respect, you are in a precarious situation." The warden stayed silent, his eyes on the pistol. "As a general of the National Revolutionary Army, I can put a good word for you." He flipped the gun in his hand, grasping it by the barrel. Like a mallet. "The Yunnanese Army is not far. If you cooperate," he met Hu's eyes. "You can still be spared."\n\nThe Warden spat in Jiang's face.\n\nAs if by reflex, Jiang struck the warden with his pistol. The warden rose in his seat as if to gasp or to moan in pain. Jiang struck him again, feeling the shock of the blow in his arm. "You insolent dog!" He was shouting now. "Where!" Crack. "Is!" Crack. "The!" Crack. "Armory!" Jiang stepped back, gasping for breath. Blood covered his face. The men pulled him back by the shoulders. A deafening silence filled the room.\n\nA moment later, a knock. Another prison guard pried the door open gingerly. His eyes met with Jiang's. "General," he said, "a messenger, from the National Protection Army." Jiang cupped his face in his hands, and sighed deeply into them."

Jiang Weiguo lifted weights, and pulled himself up the bars several times, trying to drive the crashing waves of his mind out of his ears. A film of sweat lathered his body, and perspiration drenched his jumpsuit. Jiang had never slept well as a rule, but last night was a worse episode than any other. He let go of the pull up bar, and landed with his knees folded under him.\n\n"I told you already," a man said, crouching, to the group surrounding him. Laughter inflamed their bodies. "The National Protection Army lost. A bunch of peasants from Yunnan can't possibly defeat a modern army." Jiang made his way through the shoulders of the men, staring intently at the speaker. He continued chatting, oblivious to Jiang's gaze.\n\n"You a soldier?" Jiang said. Anger bubbled within his heart, and an icelike grip grasped the coiled muscles in his arms.\n\n"What's your problem?" The man stood. He was too young to have served in the war. Jiang's fists flew out from under him, connecting solidly with the bridge of his nose. Before the other inmates could restrain him, he jumped on the fallen man. He landed two blows before the guards reined him in and beat him. Jiang closed his eyes, as truncheon after truncheon fell on his flesh.\n\nThey dragged him back to his cell, beaten, bloody, and bruised. He sat on his bed, and stared at the ceiling for what seemed an eternity."

The weather was temperate, and the blossoms flew in the wind, casting flecks of shadows on the ground. "Let's walk." He beckoned to Weiguo, who obliged.\n\nWeiguo was not entirely sure how the meeting would go. He closed his eyes, muttering softly as the two walked through the promenades of Nanjing. Still getting used to his new uniform, he walked stiffly at his brother's side. They passed through construction crews fitting cobblestones on the roads, repairmen straightening the posture of bombed buildings, laborers cleaning rubble, and though they were doing heavy labor, many were overjoyed. Victory had brought unity. Weiguo stopped in his tracks. His brother walked a few steps forward, before turning to face him.\n\n"What's the matter?" Jingguo approached him.\n\n"All of this..." Jiang Weiguo said, looking at the things around him. The throng of the world alive with the din and noise of daily life; the falling of blossoms on the ground, unperturbed; the dusty haze to the clear spring air; all of this made his heart ache. "This is not for me. The world has changed so much since they jailed me." An automobile thrummed through traffic, its engines roaring. "If it's alright with you, brother, I would rather just get on with work."\n\nThe elder Jiang nodded. He came closer and tapped Weiguo's shoulders. "That's all right." His voice seemed so far away, distant. They said their goodbyes, and parted their ways."

yun_zhengtong.52.desc:0 "Jiang Weiguo saw the burning city of Nanjing, its fires fanning high to the sky, as if to challenge the stars. The moon was out, and its light fell faintly to the carnage below. Fighting raged beneath his feet. Cries of men engaged in combat, whether Japanese or Chinese, the screaming of women and children, all merged with the crackling of fire on wood. His brother had led the retreat from the city, and evacuated as many civilians as humanly possible. Jiang had promised that he would follow.\n\nYet, now here he stood, leading the rearguard action against a hopelessly powerful enemy. He didn't have tanks, nor planes. A few guns and a few battalions was all that he had. He clapped his hands, and turned to his aide. "Captain," he said. "What will you do after the war?"\n\nThe question surprised the officer. It took him two seconds before he finally said, "I don't know, sir." Jiang chuckled mirthlessly at the answer.\n\n"Me neither." He tore his rank insignia and crushed it in his hands. "I don't have anywhere else to go. Give me your rifle and decide for yourself: to follow me and die, or to retreat and live." Jiang smiled, perhaps for the last time. He received the rifle and charged into the inferno.\n\nMoments later, the captain ripped the silver bars off his uniform and ran towards the hellish visage before him."

yun_zhengtong.53.desc:0 "Following the news of Long Yun's death, the Republic has officially begun its first legislative assembly. The late president's generals invited dissidents and partisan leaders from all across China to decide who would take up the mantle of president. If any of them believed it would be a quick decision, then they were not prepared to face reality.\n\nThe bickering had begun before the first session had started. Different factions had formed within the Assembly and each advocated for themselves with little room for compromise. Presidential candidates were proposed and deliberated upon as each faction tried to outmaneuver each other. Backroom deals were made just to be broken an hour later. As the debates carried on throughout the day and long into the night, the representatives became desperate to win something out of the first session and the votes became deadlocked between opposing coalitions. The loud debates of that morning had been replaced by the silence of the night, before a representative from Shandong rose to speak.\n\n"Why don't we elect Sun Fo? Surely the son of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen has far more wisdom and expertise than we do. If we don't elect him, then we're robbing China of its future, "declared the man from Shandong. The speech rejuvenated the Assembly as the representatives became abuzz with excitement. Sun Fo was exiled to America, forced to languish as his beloved Republic was shackled. He would be a symbol of hope and unity! A revival of a dream many gave up on long ago. A vote was quickly organized, and it was decided that Sun Fo would become president of China. All the Assembly could do was hope that he would accept the offer."

As you must have observed, our fight for a free China has come to an end, with the Japanese oppressors and Wangite traitors expelled from our motherland once and for all.\n\nNow, it is time for us to deliver our promise to the people - the promise of a new China loyal to the ideals of your father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. And you, Mr. Sun, are the symbol of unity and promise this land desperately needs.\n\nWe understand your concern about some of the unorthodox methods we resorted to during the War of Liberation, and of course, the very possibility of China once again being under a military government in a repeat of what happened during Chiang's reign. As the true heirs of Dr. Sun's ideals, We assure you that we will make every effort to rebuild the new Republic into a government that truly represents and serves its people.\n\nPerhaps, in this era of chaos, plain words mean nothing but an empty promise. Yet, we still plead humbly for your return to China. Our action shall prove more sound than any word, and all we need is you to take the helm and give the people hope.\n\nYour father has inspired many men like us in the pursuit of freedom. Now the time has come for you, sir, to rekindle the torch.\n\nVery Truly Yours,\nSong Xilian"

Yes, I do not disagree that I am the biological son of my late father, yet today, we are the same. We are all dreamers who dream of a free, just, and strong China. We are all who must live on to defend the legacy of those fallen before us. We are all the sons and the daughters of the Republic.\n\nMany brave men and women gave their lives for the arduous march towards freedom, and extreme measures had to be taken, but those days are over. Today, no longer will our dream be tainted by traitors in Nanjing, nor shall it be suppressed by the demons in Tokyo. No longer will we weep for the loss of our freedom or lick our wounds of humiliation inflicted by the eastern overlords. We rejoice under the banner of a reborn republic-- a republic that shall live up to the Three Principles of the People, a republic that bows to no brute, and a republic that fights for justice for every man in this world.\n\nI would like to end my speech with a final telegram sent before the fall of Chongqing.

My fellow compatriots,\n\nToday, I speak to you, in the flesh and through airwaves, for the first time since my ascension to the office of President of the Republic of China. Today, returns Dr. Sun's - my father's - vision upon this land anew. Today, arises our Republic from the ashes, vigor and youth restored to her bosom. It is among this atmosphere of jubilation, however, that I hence acknowledge: I am not the most fitting person to stand at her helm.\n\nI say this, not because I intend to shirk the responsibilities upon my shoulders, but because I stand here, today, simply as a man as flawed as any other. I was chosen not for extraordinary capability, but for the will of Dr. Sun that I carry in my blood, that which transcends all diverging interests and unites great and capable men under one banner. Yet those same diverging interests are far from gone - and already, before my eyes, cracks are emerging within this infant legislative assembly. Cliques, associations, interest groups - all led by men greater and more capable than I, each harboring their own intentions for China and the future.\n\nI, however, refuse to stand idly by. I refuse to believe, a nation that unshackled itself forever from the talons of imperialism should fall prey to its own divisions. It is thus in the name of this sacred title of President that I hereby proclaim: no more will disunity deny the peoples of China their victory, like it so woefully did in nineteen twenty-seven. No more will discord among our legislative and executive institutions hamper our road to prosperity, to the freedom China deserves. I vow, with my soul and conscience, to henceforth operate within the confines of the Republic's constitution - so that I shall serve the Chinese nation with nothing but my heart, and forge a path ahead for all of us to walk.\n\nTogether."

Everyone was here, indeed.\n\n"I would like to offer my gratitude," the instant the cups returned to the table, Song began. "For your continued, unwavering dedication to the cause for liberation we all share. Otherwise, none of us would be able to stand here amidst a free Nanjing." his gaze tilted, slightly, towards the horizon behind him. "Amidst a free China of our making."\n\n"With pleasure." Was Fu's curt reply.\n\n"Indeed, and for this, the Republic retains its trust in that all of you will tend to our provinces well." The smile was still hanging on the corners of Song's mouth when, without a sound, the temperature in his words began to drop. "Thus, it is to my, and our Republic's, hope that this spirit of cooperation persists well into the future, lest... unneeded disasters befall our young nation."\n\n"With all due respect, General," Xia, as if something had stung him, blurted out. "We know our business well enough. Guangxi is perfectly capable of settling its own affairs, and you will find we are still doing it now."\n\n"Then I do hope," The pause dripped into the air, as Song slowly hunched over the mahogany desk.

As he sat, alone, behind the marble desk that had become his, on and on Sun pondered this weight in his palm, the parting words of Zhang Xueliang still lingering in his ears.\n\nXueliang had been Zhang Chong's initial pick, but alas, the Young Marshal was young no longer, desiring nothing more than a tranquil final chapter. It wasn't him entrusting Sun with the position itself that put the burden on the new Minister of War's shoulder, however - it was the torrent of high hopes. The wish for Sun to subordinate all armed forces to the constitution, to the Republic itself. The wish for him to avert Chiang's worst dictatorial impulses, to maintain his trust in the men under his banner. Sun had nodded along, but even back then, murky currents had swirled in him.\n\nThe Marshal's admonishments were not... wrong, but that was asking the entire NRA to stay uniformly, unwaveringly loyal to the Republic for as long as it still stands - and, if all the regional factions and the "leftist" "rightist" cliques already coming out of the woodwork have anything to say, even that might be too much too ask. The quill was trembling in Sun's hands now. So it was true, then: stability breeds division, complacency, whenever it comes to men with guns. If only, if only people could just behave for one second-\n\nAnd then he felt it. It wasn't deadweight that the quill carried; it was strength. Vigor. The power to set right what has gone wrong or might go wrong. He grabbed a piece of paper from his right, and began. Xueliang had told him to subordinate all armed forces to the Republic itself; this he would do, with nothing but diligence to offer.\n\nIn the name of himself, his country, and everything he stands for."

Countless delegations from countries that wished to establish relations with the new China joined masses of mourning Chinese to celebrate the life of a man who had been at times ruthless, at times mysterious, and always devoted to the welfare of China and its people.\n\nTo distract himself from his grief and guilt, a white-clad Lu Han sat on a vantage point with some of Long's immediate family, overlooking the funeral, and identified as many distinct national delegations as he could. He counted some fifty or so, which made sense: more and more foreigners - even from America, Italy, Germany - were visiting China to learn about the general who had led an effort that broke Japanese hegemony forever.\n\nAt last the ceremonies ended, and people retired for the night as the sun set, bathing the sky in a brilliant red color. Walking towards the part of Zhaotong he and Long Yun had called home, Han admired the high cliffs over which he and his cousin had gallivanted in their youth. Getting home, Lu took a still-working lighter Long had gotten him when they were in their twenties, lit an incense stick, and planted it in an open-topped incense burner he kept in a room that faced the sunset.\n\nAs the sun set, the flames burned the incense and dispersed a fragrant smoke throughout the room. Lu Han grieved silently, praying that future generations would not repeat the mistakes he had made. As he thought that, he muttered under his breath, hoping Long Yun could hear him:"

Many of his countrymen died for freedom, and he would not tarnish their sacrifice with inaction. There were additional reports about the state of the economy, foreign dignitaries from the OFN and Pakt wishing for meetings, and a long list of other issues that continued to arrive on the president's desk. After signing another document, Sun Fo rose from his desk and went to his window.\n\nOutside the president's office, the streets were abuzz with life. Children ran through the streets with sparklers while street vendors peddled their wares. While the parents attempted to contain their children's excitement, men in suits walked through the streets with their heads held high. No matter where Sun Fo looked, no matter who he looked at, he saw the same thing: the smiles of people who felt pride for the first time in a century. The president cracked a grin as he returned to his desk.\n\nAs Sun Fo opened another briefing, he felt the same infectious pride wash over him. The Assembly may be at each other's throats, each piece of legislation may take a titanic struggle to enact, and each day may work him to the bone, but the president didn't care. Despite China's humiliating past, despite China's deadlocked present, and despite China's uncertain future, Sun Fo knew deep down how it would all end."

Today, at least, it was true tranquility accompanying Ye and his fellow cadres - rather than the dreadful silence of years past, tailored solely to the imprisonment of one woman.\n\n"Madame Song has always remained sympathetic to the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, more than can be said for certain other elements in the current government." Recited Yang Dezhi. "It's safer here, compared to the rest of Nanjing."\n\n"Indeed. Even in her absence, we enjoy her hospitality." Ye nodded, his gaze unwavering. Outside, birds were chirping, their playful tunes laden with innocence. "I have reason to believe her efforts have been absolutely vital in the current legislative assembly's ability to maintain even a semblance of peace - which in itself is commendable, admist the calls for another anti-communist purge already bubbling back up as we speak." He sighed. "Today Kuomintang soldiers and Red Army fighters might still greet each other on the streets; tomorrow, there could be another April 12th for all I know. Peace is a fragile thing, as it has always been."\n\n"Which brings us to the purpose of this meeting - " With this, he rose to his feet. "The Communist Party stands at a disadvantage in influence, and it is time we remedied that." He began towards the exit. "I'll be away from Nanjing for a while, five days at most.

YUN_uniform_legal_code_desc:0 "Break one law? Just hope over the border and you are scot free! Chaos in trade, in the media, in everyday life is the only reward for being so lazy as to unify without actually unifying!

YUN_he_must_retire:0 "He Must Retire"
YUN_he_must_retire_desc:0 "No one doubts He Yingqin's record in the past and we have much to thank him for. But in recent years he has become reserved, retrieting into his palace and delegating ever more authority to those unworthy of it.

YUN_biased_land_distribution:0 "Biased Land Distribution"
YUN_biased_land_distribution_desc:0 "He Yingqin himself held not inconsiderable land, and the same can be said of many of his old allies. Their lands now lay open, with their laborers anxious to learn what will become of them. Naturally those close to Lu Han as well as those who have been so instrumental in the creation of Xinan ought to be given first pick of the unowned land, and a simple vetted auction will quite easily take... some of this land off of Lu's hands. Some shall be acquired by Lu Han himself, naturally."
YUN_two_brothers_still:0 "Two Brothers Still"
YUN_two_brothers_still_desc:0 "While the names have been changed and the borders have been redrawn, the simple fact remains that Yunnan and Guizhou are not the same land and cannot be treated as such. Under the watchful eye of Lu Han only the highest level of administration shall be fully changed, and local life may go on much as it has before the merging of the two. The boss's boss may change and the taxes are paid to a different man, but it is best not to offend unnecessarily."
YUN_rational_infrastructure:0 "Rational Infrastructure"
YUN_rational_infrastructure_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest enemy of wealth in Xinan is its poor infrastructure.

Our mines are deep and well-dug. Our peasants work as hard and for as little pay as any peasant in the whole Sphere.\n\nBut there is room here for improvement. Our fields are great but still too small, too ancient in their design. Our mines could be dug so much deeper, so much more greedily, and our peasants often have enough time in the day to partake in indolence, and they would not suffer much to be a little hungrier.\n\nWe understand that this is not the conventional wisdom. The Reorganized Government seeks to move beyond being a 'mere' breadbasket, This suits us in two ways. First of all the demand for raw materials grows ever stronger as new factories flicker into life, and second of all the stomach of the sphere will grow no less hungry as the cities rise and sprawl from the dirt like the wild mushrooms we export in great, yet inadequate quantities.\n\nWe will seize the mantle as the true 'breadbasket' of the Sphere, and Xinan will provide the raw firmament they shall twist into the miracles of a new age."

This isn't an issue on its own, but it reveals a shocking lack of progress in this, the cornerstone of our economy. Our landscape is draped in mountains and plateaus, the buried bounty of the Earth lies just beyond our grasp. But not for long. We must bring our eyes to bare upon these resources, opening bold new avenues of tin, lead, zinc, iron, silver, gold and coal, as well as a hundred other roads that we shall take to prosperity.\n\nFor this task the few experts we have to hand will be rallied, along with a few experts in geology, geography, metallurgy and the mining industry from as far away as Manchuria. The likely candidates first, near existing mines. After these have been examined we shall move on to new pastures that we shall rip up and exploit. Once we have the facilities in place, all gathered under a new 'Bureau of Expansion, Efficiency and Exploitation', we shall methodically and thoroughly examine the country for likely sites. The land must be numbered, weighed for its potential and divided into new zones for development.\n\nSome of these developments will be resisted by reactionary elements who fear progress. They will protest that we would destroy their villages, their forests and their fields. But the march of time is inexorable, We have not yet begun the survey, but the writing is on the wall."

A junior member of the bureau of expansion, efficiency and exploitation has suggested we delay the opening ceremonies of certain mines to save on expenses.\n\nAfter firing him we have come slightly closer to a great leap forward, towards full exploitation of our natural resources. This is a tremendous moment for dozens of communities around Xinan who will soon have access to exciting new jobs in our mineshafts. Some villages in the end did have to be relocated, but their employment in making Xinan the master of metals is an opportunity we are sure they would thank us for if we ever ask them.\n\nHaving said that, a debate still rages in Kunming over the precise colour and type of ribbon to be used.

It is their fault that their home-made tools keep breaking when put under the necessary stresses of a modern mining environment. Even the tools made by our small manufacturing base prove inadequate. No one in Xinan thinks big enough to make the tools we need!\n\nFor this reason we must look further afield for our tools. The mines of the Reorganized Government and Manchuria are both seeking to modernise, meaning that much of their old equipment is going to be for sale. We will be a welcome market for these cast-offs, but more excitingly a number of Japanese manufacturers have took notice of our efforts, and have contacted us offering to sell the latest in drilling, extracting and processing technology. For an extortionate price of course, but what price is too steep when we spend it for our peasants welfare?\n\nObviously the answer is any price but that's the way we'll spin it in the papers. Clearly we need to accommodate our frail workers with the latest in profit-multiplying equipment. This investment will be costly, but if it can finally bring our mines into the 20th century it'll all be worth it. We can save money on the safety equipment though.

We weep for those forgotten by the old regime. Wretched old and new shall both be saved. We shall save them.\n\nThey shall be given barracks to live in. Rations to eat. Uniforms to cover their nakedness. Their children will be taken to well-funded housing. We will look after them. The folks who do refuse to acknowledge our authority and our charity will receive what they wish, nothing. So any aid they are receiving will be cut, including the right to protection by the police and the army.\n\nIf they choose to reject our rule, then so be it."

We, as people, as human beings, naturally gravitate towards compassion and care for our loved ones, for it is both human nature and the way of our ancestors. The concept of family is perhaps tethered to us the closest, the folks you are willing to protect with your life, to fight tooth and nail for.\n\nThese emotions, omnipresent within our population, are the things we should utilize to bolster our forces.

YUN_one_china_against_the_enemy_desc:0 ""Why did China lose?" is a question for historians. When we ponder this question, many of us may jump to practical and seemingly obvious conclusions; logistics, technology, economics. However, beyond the numbers and calculations, there is something far more apparent with the nature of China at the time.\n\nChina didn't lose together, it lost divided, and separated into squabbling pieces. China needs to be truly one country, not a group of nations or a federation or a nation with regional autonomies, but a singular, solid unitary nation. Workmen who do not work together cannot build a house, they must be of one mind, be one animal with many bodies. If we are to achieve victory, we cannot do so with divides and petty altercations, we must be whole."

So as with wolves, we too do not leave the carcass of the Hanjian state and the Japanese overlord to rot, rather we make use of it.\n\nTelegraph. Telephone, railway. Communication and control networks run like bleeding arteries through the broken countryside. Offices that once held corporate slave drivers or stooge politicians now fly the Red and Black sun of sorrow and rage. The Yuan buildings are no longer squabbling houses of empty promises, but a beating heart of a single, united nation.\n\nIt is not hypocrisy for us to use the same methods, or even the same buildings, as the previous regime. Rather, it is a form of sensible recycling."

Truly, only the bright and dynamic leadership style of Long Yun could ensure this ascension. It is an absolute truth that in times of desperation, the cream rises to the top.\n\nFrom unknown backrooms the come, from classrooms and satanic mills. By their dozens, by their hundreds. People with skill, vision, dedication, tenacity, loyalty and a thousand other virtues too esoteric and too essential to name. Some cannot take the strain, and break quickly. Some don't know how to play the game, and disappear. But a select few have what it takes to be great. Old China used examination to enforce meritocracy, we have a more direct understanding of the term. The world is not merely upside down, it is spinning. But we can manage it, or rather, they can."

The school of poverty has many pupils, but few graduates. It teaches the folly of want, of wishing for something better. Not for us is perfection, we make do and mend.\n\nBlackpowder explosives kill just as surely as they did centuries ago and are easier to make than a modern grenade. A scrap metal railway line will not survive a hundred trips, but it will get the train where it needs to go. Bedsheets cut into tunics make a poor uniform, but it keeps the cold out.

Where once we could repair and refit, now the only possibility left is to tear down and rebuild from the ground up.\n\nFor many, the act of creating factories and workshops that could produce an industry was itself an unsurpassable effort. It took us the blood, sweat and tears of hundreds of men to reach where we are, and now those same temples of human resilience lie bombed and blackened, utterly unusable. Some even became symbols for their entire villages or towns - their own contribution to the war effort, a standing sign of their determination to win.

The figure of Long Yun hangs like a shadow over dozens of empty villages.\n\nBut he was never the enemy. It was not Long Yun who massacred the sons of China in their thousands as they bravely fought and perished on the battlefields - it was the Hanjian, the traitors, the servants and lapdogs of a foreign presence who fought not for themselves or their families but for the rich parasites who sat far away in the lap of comfort in Tokyo.

The most dangerous of people have no high-minded goal, they just hold a burning hatred for us and our leader. Our units are being extended and given broad civilian legal powers.
