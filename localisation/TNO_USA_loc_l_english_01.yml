 USA_OFN_South_Africa_desc:0 "자유국가기구는 지구상에 마지막으로 남아 있는 민주 국가들을 돕기 위해 만들어졌으며, 남아프리카의 취약한 민주주의 정권은 우리의 도움이 필요합니다. 독일의 침공이 눈앞에 다가온 상황에서, 우리는 그들이 독일국에게 굴복하지 않도록 국가적인 지원을 보장해야 할 필요가 있습니다. 아프리카의 마지막 민주주의의 등불이 꺼지기까지 시간이 얼마 남지 않았습니다."

 USA_OFN_Canada_desc:0 "캐나다는 정당한 영국의 통치자가 런던을 되찾을 수 있도록 준비를 하고 있지만, OFN에서 가장 헌신적인 국가이기도 합니다. 이처럼 그들은 독일군에 대항하는 아프리카 전쟁에서 우리에게 절실히 필요한 도움을 줘야 할 의무가 있습니다. 캐나다 동맹국을 불러야 하는데, 누가 알겠습니까, 우리가 그들에게 돈을 줄 수도 있겠죠."

 USA_OFN_boer_atrocities_desc:0 "전반적으로 미국 국민들은 여전히 평화주의적 신념이 강해 보입니다. 이 전쟁은 현재 지역 분쟁일 뿐이지만 우리 고향 사람들은 머나먼 이국 땅에서 또 다른 전쟁이 일어나는 것을 그리 달갑게 여기지 않습니다. 우리는 남아프리카에서 독일군이 범죄를 저지르고 있다는 보고를 받고 있는데, 우리가 이 내용을 약간 과장한다면 우리가 필요로 할 수 있는 지원을 받을 수 있을 것입니다. 우리는 모든 미국인들이 우리와 싸우고 있는 바로 그 적들의 적개심을 높이기 위해 독일의 잔인성을 부풀러야 합니다."
 USA_OFN_dominoe_theory:0 "도미노 이론"
 USA_OFN_dominoe_theory_desc:0 "이것은 다른 누군가를 착취하기 위한 전쟁이 아니라 민주주의를 위한 전쟁입니다. 만일 우리가 경기에 나서지 않는다면 나라가 하나하나 나치가 되버릴 것입니다. 우리한테로 넘어오는 도미노 행렬을 막을 유일한 방법은 도미노 첫 조각이 떨어지러 하기 전에 그걸 막는 것 뿐 입니다. 남아프리카는 미국으로까지 이어지는 긴 도미노 행렬의 첫 조각으로 우리는 남아프리카를 쓰러지게 내버려둘 수 없습니다."
 USA_OFN_a_righteous_war:0 "옳은 전쟁"
 USA_OFN_a_righteous_war_desc:0 "이 전역에서 우리의 임무는 고정되고 불변합니다. OFN의 지도국으로써 모든 민주주의 국가가 모든 대륙에서 자유의 종을 울릴 수 있게 싸우는 것입니다. 우리는 남아프리카의 자유를 지키기 위해, 그 이상도 이하의 목표도 가지고 있지 않고 전쟁을 치루는 것입니다. 만일 우리가 이를 확실히 해낼 수 있다면 우리는 아프리카에 확고한 권력기반을 다질 수 있을 것입니다."
 USA_OFN_AS_and_NZ:0 "태평양 규합하기"
 USA_OFN_AS_and_NZ_desc:0 "오스트레일리아는 우리가 전쟁 노력에 필요한 만큼 우리를 필요로 합니다. 우리는 호주인들에게 단지 미국이 태평양 영토들을 감시하고 있는 중이며 우리가 치루는 작은 전쟁에 같이 참여해주기를 원하고 있다고 말해주기만 하면 됩니다. 우리는 호주 수상에 가능한 한 빠르게 전화를 걸어 그를 우리 편으로 끌어들어야 합니다."
 USA_OFN_protect_the_beacon:0 "긴급 지원"
 USA_OFN_protect_the_beacon_desc:0 "우리는 남아프리카에 뻗을 자리를 빠르게 잃고 있으며, 다가오는 OFN 정상회의에서 남아프리카를 볼 수 없다고 예측할 정도로 상황이 악화되고 있습니다. 우리 군을 남아프리카의 전쟁터에 보낼 수 있을 때 까지 그들이 버틸 수 있을 정도로 긴급하게 장비를 보내주는 것이 급선무입니다. 우리는 빠르게 행동해야 합니다. 민주주의가 서 있기 위해 고분고투하고 있습니다."
 USA_OFN_the_economy:0 "그게 경제야, 바보야"
 USA_OFN_the_economy_desc:0 "우리 군은 오랜 세월이 지나며 약해졌고, 시대가 바뀌고 강대국간의 관계가 냉각되면서 이 전쟁을 이용해 다시 한번 우리의 군사 엔진에 시동을 걸어야 합니다. 일부 정치인들은 군산복합체에 대해 경고하고 있지만 그들은 약하고 소심한 것 뿐입니다. 전쟁에서 승리하기 위해서 우리는 강하고 대담해져야 합니다!"
 USA_OFN_a_necessary_war:0 "필요한 전쟁"
 USA_OFN_a_necessary_war_desc:0 "이 전쟁에서 반드시 싸워야 합니다! 우리가 만약 아프리카의 나치놈들에게 전쟁을 주지 않는다면 그들이 결국 자신들에게 유리한 전쟁을 우리에게 가져다 줄 것이며 우리는 그런 일이 일어나도록 묵과할 수 없습니다. 남아프리카의 안녕을 지키고 아시아로 향하는 동양항로를 안전하게 유지하기 위해서는 전쟁이 반드시 필요합니다. 아시아로 가는 안전한 통로가 사라진다면 아시아에서 우리의 영향력을 늘릴 기회가 영영 사라져버리는 지옥같은 미래만 남을 뿐입니다."
 USA_OFN_guards_iceland:0 "아이슬란드 규합하기"
 USA_OFN_guards_iceland_desc: "아이슬란드는 하나의 커다란 군사 기지로써 많은 아이슬란드 젊은이들은 우리 미군과 함께 훈련받아 더러는 지원병으로, 라디오 운영자로, 현장 간호병으로, 기술직 요원으로 훈련을 받았습니다. 아이슬란드는 전쟁에 크게 기여할 방법은 없긴 하지만 그들은 최고의 지원 요원을 파견해 군인들을 보조해줄 수 있습니다."
 USA_OFN_guards_west_indies:0 "주둔군 집결: 서인도 제도"
 USA_OFN_guards_west_indies_desc:0 "서인도 연방을 구성하는 아주 많고 작은 섬들이 있습니다. 그들이 다 뭉치면 적어도 1개 사단 정도는 나와야 할 것입니다. 이건 니네 의무라고, 망할 것들아!"

 USA_OFN_guards_guyana_desc:0 "그들은 기여할 것이 별로 없을 것 같아 보이긴 하지만 그들이 도와야 할 것을 최대한 도와주는 것이 그들의 의무라는 것은 확실합니다. 아프리카로 가라고, 느려 터진 가이아나인들아."
 USA_OFN_South_Africa_summit:0 "OFN 정상 회의: 남아프리카"
 USA_OFN_South_Africa_summit_desc:0 "우리 군대는 비상 정상회담을 시작하기 직전까지 적을 저지할 수 있었습니다. 다행히도 여기에 남아프리카 대표도 참석할 것입니다. 이번 정상회담에서 우리 지도자들은 이번 전쟁의 진로를 계획하고 향후 남아프리카의 참여에 대해 논의할 예정입니다. 일단 우리가 끝마치면 남아프리카의 모든 적들에게 대혼란을 줄 것입니다. 그들의 자유는 지켜질 것입니다."

"대통령 각하, 그들은 카드로 만든 집입니다. 영국은 외국의 점령자 밑에서 분노하고 있으며, 브르타뉴는 비밀리에 우리와 접촉하고 있고 노르웨이도 수십년간의 점령에 지속적으로 저항하고 있습니다. 또한 그들의 아프리카 식민지들은 지원 없이는 덩쿨 위에서 시들어버릴 겁니다."\n\n"어떻게 시작됐는지 잊지 않고 문장을 완성할 수 없는 한 남자가 모든 것을 함께 붙잡고 있으니까," 닉슨은 언급했습니다.\n\n"히틀러가 사라질 때, 그의 후계자들은 알렉산더 대왕의 장군들이 고대에 그랬던 것처럼 스스로 전리품을 나누기 위해 쓰러질 거라네." 레어드는 CIA 서류함에서 문서 뭉치를 건네줬습니다.

OFN은 아프리카의 마지막 민주주의를 지켜야 했습니다. 하지만, 둘 모두 OFN 가입이 불러올 수 있는 독일의 개입은 원하지 않았습니다. 그래서 남아프리카 탱고는 끝없이 이어졌습니다.\n\n"오늘은 어떻게 도와드릴까요, 대사님?" 로저스는 지루함을 숨기기 위해 무미건조한 어조로 말했습니다. 무슨 대답이 돌아올지는 거의 완벽하게 예측할 수 있었습니다.

"독일은 내부에서 썩어가고 있습니다. 우리가 슈페어를 집권시킨다면, 독일은 여러 집단이 그에게 필사적으로 맞서면서 혼란에 빠질 것입니다. 우리는 독일을 끝내기 위해 이러는 것이지, 어쩔 수 없습니다!"\n\n긴 침묵 후에 베넷이 말했습니다.

"슈페어는 히틀러의 뒤를 이어 우리와 대화를 나누고 싶어하는 유일한 후보입니다. 우리는 그를 취임시키고, 금수조치 해제 약속과 함께 독일을 묶어둘 수 있습니다. 그렇게 된다면 우리는 일본에 집중할 수 있습니다. 슈페어는 문제를 일으키는 학생 급진주의자들 때문에 매우 바쁘게 될겁니다. 이는 위협이 아니라 기회입니다."\n\n또다른 걱정으로 침묵했습니다.

Now, however, ballistic missiles fly far higher and faster than even the fastest jets, and as a result, can no longer be countered conventionally.\n\nAs a solution, the Department of Defense has envisioned the Sentinel Program. In it, a series of low-range, anti-ballistic missile sites will be placed around the continental United States. If enemy missiles come nearby, these sites will fire guided missiles in response to intercept and destroy them.

Among these innovations are helicopter-focused infantry, highly mobile ground units to outflank and surround enemy positions, and advanced naval detection technology and protocols. America has seen the future of warfare, and the future is American."

Now we need to clean up the mess Bennett left behind."

While this allowed huge profits to be gathered by the owners and stockholders in the short term, the effects in the long term will lead to consequences that we cannot even begin to predict. A suite of executive orders will lasso these companies back to a more equal and fair playing field. The horse may have escaped the stable, but we can bring it back."

While economic progress was seen at the start, soon it was clear that the rich were only getting richer, the middle class saw a tiny bump, and the poor saw next to no progress, and even a regression as government budgets were stretched.

 USA_BFW_68_Tone_Back_Trade:0 "Tone Back Trade"
 USA_BFW_68_Tone_Back_Trade_desc:0 "President Wallace Bennett sought to increase prosperity by increasing trade. However, Bennett's idea of trade was to move high paying manufacturing jobs from America's great cities to areas of the world that had weak unions, little protections and no need to pay their workers much above subsistence levels, and then selling what was made back to America. While this made the big companies that still owned the factories and the distribution methods rich, and helped those countries bolster their economies, it put thousands out of work here at home, and rippled through the American economy. We should rectify this balance, encourage the companies to return home and employ our citizens, even if it does make our friends and allies angry."

However, as we look into the clauses and appendices, we now realize that dismantling the deals will be incredibly difficult: not just from a diplomatic standpoint, but with some of the most wealthy and influential power brokers in New York and Washington, not to mention the impact on the budget from the big companies headquartered in the US. It may be a better idea to make incremental changes and minor alterations for now, and see if we can get a better deal later."

America elevated itself to become the number one economy in the world by our own hard work and prudence, without any foreign help. Our allies should do the same, whether they like it or not."

Of course, our supporters and average citizens are not so attuned to the machinations inside the Beltway, so they are angry and disappointed at another politician lying to them. Of course, we can't tell them that we are only working with them for now so we can destroy them later, and get a bit of money in the meantime."

 USA_BFW_68_Slap_on_the_Tarrifs_desc:0 "The biggest problem with free trade, besides the lost jobs and obscene profits made by the rich, is the huge hole it punched into our federal budget. By eliminating those tariffs, we had basically cut off our legs to help the American people and the schools, roads and infrastructure that truly helps. Therefore, we are going to put some of the customs duties back on. Our trade partners might through a conniption, but it's a small price to pay to make our country better."

The new President, however, has directed the State Department to start drawing up plans to alter the deals to benefit the citizens of the US more. This will help the American worker get back to work, the taxpayer pay less taxes, and perhaps get us some more voters as well.\n\nThey better pray that we don't alter it any further."

Agriculture is one area that we can leverage: the United States is the breadbasket of the world, and many of our OFN allies don't have the access to the good farmland that we do, and the bountiful harvests that we produce annually. If we can negotiate to give our farmers a leg up, to make foreign markets more open to sell their grain and cattle, then we can show that we are taking the threat of the deals seriously, and maybe get a few more votes in the Midwest for the next election."

 USA_BFW_68_Crank_Up_Exports_desc:0 "While there are a lot of issues with the now retired President Bennett's trade deals, one thing that we are in favor of is the fact that other nations reduced their tariffs to American goods. This will, of course, make superior goods, especially those Made in the USA, that much more profitable and enticing to foreign markets. So even though we had to deal with a flood of cheap knockoffs, we can at the very least sell our own, much higher quality products overseas. The consumer goods must flow!"

 USA_BFW_68_Free_at_Last_desc:0 "No more will we sacrifice the average American, the working and middle classes, on the altar of the Almighty Dollar. There are more important things to life than the pursuit of gold and riches. While our Allies may not like it, and the big companies are angry and in panic, it is time that what we make in America should be sold and consumed by Americans first to increase our standard of living, and not be forced to buy inferior goods made from overseas that we were forced to bring in from the deals. Now, we are free as a nation to buy the best, and the best is American."

 USA_BFW_68_the_Profits_Roll_in_desc:0 "Politics is a messy business, and one where changing your mind is either prized as "realism and prudence," or vilified as "flip-flopping and corruption." Most times, it results in both. Our backtracking on changing the free trade deals has resulted in both extremes. However, our tweaks and slight changes of the nuts and bolts of the deals has resulted in an increased income into the Treasury Department, which we can now use as we see fit."

Every man that has held the office has impacted it in some way or another, and even though we did our best to mitigate the worst effects of our predecessor, there will still be elements and traces of his administration for generations to come.\n\nTherefore, we must now work toward creating the legacy of President [USA.GetLeader], to bring our nation forward, and to make the USA better than ever before.

There are, after all, countless rebel groups in the Philippines, more than one of which has already claimed responsibility through graffiti, leaflets, and pirate radio.\n\nAccompanying the update on the bombing was a new request for security and economic aid to the Aquino government. More guns, more bullets, some surplus vehicles for their security forces, and money to hire new police thugs. Filipino industries can make cheap goods for Sphere markets, but their defense sector is practically nonexistent. Besides, it would hardly even qualify as a line item in our ministry budgets."

"그래요, 밥. 실행하세요."\n\n맥나마라의 보좌관 중 한 명이 말려져 있는 지도를 들고 걸어옵니다. 이것엔 동남아시아 국가의 상세한 지도가 그려져 있습니다. "가장 큰 잠재 목표 중 두 가지는 인도네시아와 필리핀입니다. 인도네시아는 일본의 자원 수탈과, 군사 정권, 그리고 원주민 협력자들에 의해 생겨난 문자 그대로의 정치적 군도입니다. 한편, 필리핀은 우리가 잘 알고 있듯이 반항적인 국가이고, 이 사람들은 점령자들에게 매우 분개하고 있다고 여겨집니다. 두 나라 모두 활발한 반역 세력을 가지고 있어, 이를 도쿄에게 대항하는 대리국으로 삼을 수 있습니다."\n\n닉슨은 생각에 잠긴 모습으로 두 손을 마주 대고 지도에 점점이 찍힌 검붉은 표지를 응시합니다. "좋습니다, 밥. 이 대리전을 어떤 형태로 끌고 갈겁니까?"\n\n맥나마라의 보좌관들은 더 많은 지도, 더 많은 목록, 더 많은 설명을 꺼내왔습니다. 그리고 아침 내내, 일본 제국에 새로운 칼을 들이밀기 위한 피비린내 나는 전략이 성립됩니다."

Such a contrast to when he held fiery speeches in front of thousands, and spearheaded negotiations that led to the eventual peace that descended upon the Einheitspakt. Even with his boundless optimism, he was worried.\n\nBrandt knew that he could never step foot into Germany again. He was a man in exile; forever destined to be cast out for his actions, punished when justice was a degraded and humiliated concept. Yet he did not feel shame, or guilt, or anger. Brandt's only concern remained with the future at large.\n\nWould Germany relent, shedding its bloodied history of the past few decades and embrace what had made it so strong, or would it falter, and remain prey to the forces that wished to doom everyone to the darkness of fascism?"

CBS 뉴스의 한 기자는 대통령 보좌관의 말을 인용해, "미래에 마다가스카르를 자유롭게 만들 수 있다는 사실에 흥분한다"며 "세계적인 파시스트 테러리즘의 종말의 시작"이라고 묘사했습니다.\n\n아직도 마다가스카르가 무엇인지 아는 미국인은 거의 없습니다. 지금 이 순간을 초래한 문제의 복잡성에 대한 이해도는 훨씬 더 적습니다."

USA_running_on_fumes_desc:0 "To say that the recent Oil Crisis has thrown a wrench into our economy is a vast understatement. Much like a well functioning machine, the US economy is heavily reliant on a steady supply of petroleum to work efficiently. While oil reserves exist in states like California and Texas, it is simply not enough to provide for the ever-growing needs of our population. The recent economic malaise of the past few decades is still fresh in the minds of America, and as such, preventing another, potentially worse crisis is paramount to our survival. A Presidential Task Force will be formed to secure new sources of oil, calm down internal strife, and apply a handful of administrative measures to resolve this issue. We can survive anything the world throws at us!"
USA_set_the_prices_desc:0 "Opportunistic businessmen have already implemented outrageous prices on the cost of gasoline and oil related products. This cannot stand! Effective immediately, the Federal Government will implement wide-reaching price controls and permit an efficient system of enforcement to ensure that no ludicrous pricing slips through the cracks. While the... less ethical viewpoint of this crisis would be to sustain profit, we must ensure affordability for the common consumer. Price controls will also help us slow down our soon-to-increase inflation rate, and provide some more stability in local markets. Those who are looking to personally profit off such a disastrous crisis must be restricted and taught the error of their ways, for the good of the nation."
USA_the_Federal_Energy_Office_desc:0 "Our current and past Administrations have not had any dedicated resources to meet the energy requirements of the country. With the current crisis in full swing, this can no longer stand. Through an Executive Order and hopefully action from the Legislative Branch, we can create an Agency which is responsible for managing as well as allocating our supply of electricity, collect information on the power needs of America, coordinate foreign policy measures to keep our trade of natural resources which can produce energy, and can regulate prices. While the Office will of course increase efficiency and scope with time, and perhaps even become a fully fledged cabinet-level department one day, their efforts now will help manage this crisis to a point where it does not strain an unprepared bureaucracy."
USA_Bigger_in_Texas_desc:0 "Texas is one of the largest producers of crude oil in the world. Despite this fact, it is not enough to keep up with the needs of Domestic oil use. Although there are already plenty of corporations drilling for oil in the area, it is not enough. We need to encourage existing drillers to expand, new drillers to set up rigs, and subsidise their businesses so they don't immediately go under from the weight of their expenses. Hopefully with all of this initiative going forward, Texan oil will heat homes during winters in New Jersey, power trucks on interstate highways in Utah, and keep industries running in Florida long enough for us to sort all of this out."
USA_Odd_Even_Rationing_desc:0 "Despite creating efficiency bottlenecks, enforcing strict price controls, and increasing our immediate as well as future supply of oil, it is simply not enough. This is a full-blown national emergency, and as such we will have to enforce rationing on our markets. Our system can't work as well as it is able to if our supply of oil isn't evenly spread. Businesses, private citizens, or agencies hoarding supplies of gasoline or crude oil supplies is simply unacceptable. We have a responsibility to ensure an even supply spread; perhaps even implementing ration cards and expanding the powers of the Federal Energy Office to punish those who do not comply. A thinly-spread supply of oil is better than no oil for some, as it goes."
USA_Synthetic_Alternatives_desc:0 "Recent advances in technology and scientific research has offered potential breakthroughs in alternative supplies of fuel. Although existing technology has already existed and was implemented by the Germans during the Second World War, it is now at a point where it is efficient and advanced enough to contribute to civilian supplies of fuel. Experts and cabinet advisors are skeptical about the short-term application of subsidizing such an experimental process, given that the scale it will be implemented on is mild at best. However, with time and enough funds thrown their way, we're sure that a stable supply of synthetics will at the very least reduce the negative impacts of future energy crises. Let's send a stimulus package to these scientists and industrialists as well as officially support their efforts, so that perhaps we have alternatives to rely upon a few years from now."
USA_Disaster_Averted_desc:0 "Through all of our efforts, we are starting to see miniscule signs of recovery. Despite there still being long lines at gas stations, a lack of supply in some areas, and a general slowdown of the entire economy, things are beginning to return to normal. Many policy experts and key figures in our administration are confident that the worst is over. Despite the Crisis still being in full swing, it is at least starting to slow down on the home front, with our economy showing signs of life again. We can now return to approaching our domestic agenda without fear of the entire country imploding in on itself from a lack of fuel. As we remember the impacts of this crisis and the consequences of past losses on the American consciousness, we can now steadily move forward to a safe and secure future, one where the public is protected from emergencies and the American Dream can still survive against overwhelming odds."
USA_reach_out_to_Riyadh_desc:0 "Saudi Arabia holds more cheap oil than any other nation on Earth. Miles of oil wells have stuck out of its dunes for decades, pumping millions of barrels of liquid gold a day. Italian colonialism expanded these lucrative fields to new plays underneath both the desert sands and the Persian Gulf. In a twist of irony, the Arabian Desert is now an oasis for a planet famished for oil.\n\nThe President's advisors unanimously believe King Faisal is America's ticket out of the Oil Crisis. However, its ideal method of approach is still subject to debate. Some believe Arabia needs firm reassurances from the Free World, up to and especially a tour de force. Conversely, others warn of the risks involved in repeating the South African and Indonesian debacles, instead advocating for diplomacy and more... clandestine, means to support the monarch."
USA_Securing_Our_Interests_desc:0 "America runs a race against an oil market on the brink of freefall; if it fails, then so too will its economy. In these precarious circumstances, mistakes made of haste are more easily forgiven if they ultimately preserve the country's fortunes.\n\nWashington is sure to make plenty of mistakes by intervening overtly in the Arabian peninsula, to say nothing of the political capital it needs to convince Congress and the people in favor of another foreign adventure. Rest easy knowing that the sacrifices we make now will pay off for millions of Americans' lives decades into the future. Prosperity, after all, makes forgiveness an easy choice."
USA_Gifts_For_The_King_desc:0 "King Faisal holds sway over a nation-state's embryo. He may have government, culture, recognition and rule of law - but without the guns to back its monopoly on violence, his dynasty may as well be one more tribe among the Arabian peninsula's lawless bedouins. More specifically, Bedouins vulnerable to the nationalistic overtures of a united Arab identity.\n\nHere America can leverage its economic largesse to buttress the young nation's precarious position. A shipment of guns both outdated and state-of-the-art will assure the King of his state's lastingness in the face of a subcontinent's worth of foes."
USA_King_Faisal_Im_CIA_desc:0 "The fruits of human intelligence compound with every year they operate within a country's borders. In turn, a well-established intelligence apparatus both forewarns and precludes enemy action, sometimes without their knowledge.\n\nWhich is why the CIA is so eager to expand their operations in the Middle East as of late. Our stiletto in the dark needs ample preparation time to conduct their covert deeds - we can satisfy their demands by sending them into the region before our armed forces. The Company will wreak their infamous havoc where we need it most soon enough."
USA_Operation_Sandstorm_desc:0 "As of late, the Joint Chiefs of Staff busied themselves with preparing America's most comprehensive expeditionary force since Indonesia. Drawing from the lessons learned in the past decade's two largest wars, the country's finest generals and admirals drew minute, extensive plans for a lightning war involving all four branches of the US Armed Forces. They described the immense firepower America's tanks, guns, ships and planes combined will demonstrate as a "shock and awe campaign" spanning the Middle East, routinely inspected for any flaws that may lead to another quagmire.\n\nAll told, the Pentagon assured America that Sandstorm will promise just that: a storm. Woe betide the fools who bar its path."
USA_Step_Up_Our_Shipments_desc:0 "Our army lives and dies by supply routes thousands of miles astride the East Coast and the Persian Gulf. As their principal supplier, said supply routes likewise dictate the Royal Saudi Land Forces' shape, tempo and effectiveness. Heavier combat necessitates several thousands more tons of shipment sent per day; should our logistics fail to meet the armies' demands, we will likely see both their ammunition and morale plummet deep enough to hit a reservoir of oil.\n\nThe simple solution is to increase the pace of convoys running extant routes. We can always rely on our capable merchant marine to implement this directive to their abilities' best."
USA_Black_Gold_Rush_desc:0 "One immeasurable benefit of direct cooperation with Saudi Arabia is direct access to their pipelines bursting full with oil. Their generosity has thus far ably stemmed the bleeding on America's economy since the Oil Crisis began. With war on their doorstep, and the US Army their most stalwart shield against it, the Saudis believe dedicating some of their valuable pumps solely for our army's consumption - after their extracts leave the refineries, of course - will service both themselves and us in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nReally, who are we to disagree?"
USA_Pick_Your_Targets_desc:0 "The CIA's contacts have proven their worth by providing every last iota of intelligence they can gather about our adversaries' leaders. Blueprints, photographs, sensitive documents, and even hearsay all blended into coherent narratives and routines involving the Middle East's most famous and infamous. The lax environments their abodes exhibit would scream danger to our agents - were they tasked with protecting them. Instead, the CIA saw only chances gaping wide open.\n\nWith the leaders' lives laid bare before the Company's omnipresent eyes, certain personages believe now is the most opportune time to plunge our stiletto in the dark behind their backs."
USA_Finding_Their_Leaders_desc:0 "Pan-Arabism is a mass movement, with its corresponding strengths, weaknesses, and weaknesses disguised as strengths. In particular, the ideology has mobilized millions throughout the Middle East around several charismatic ideologues like Arafat and al Sadat. If the presence of such men inflamed the people's passions, then would not their sudden, abrupt absence snuff these passions out?\n\nThe United States government has always been a staunch advocate of evidence based policy. As its foremost experts in unconventional policymaking, Langley has been tasked to make conclusive results out of Pan-Arabism's greatest progeny."
USA_In_For_The_Kill_desc:0 "What America needs the least in the middle of its greatest economic crisis since the Depression is a protracted conflict sucking its money and attention. South Africa and Indonesia had played merry hell on both - and that was with a healthy economy. From White House to janitor, America's government has wholeheartedly resolved to prevent Saudi Arabia from spiraling into a worse repeat of the last two wars that had wasted its energies and fortunes.\n\nTo this end, the President has requested that the Pentagon draw a time table for military operations in the Middle East, immediately followed by withdrawal plans upon the war's conclusion. If Washington has its way, then American soldiers will not spend any more time in the sandbox than they absolutely must."

USA.oilcrisis.1.t:0 "The Earth Bleeds"
USA.oilcrisis.1.desc:0 "The horrible fighting has begun again.\n\nBeneath the shifting sands of the Middle East oil pumps like blood through the veins of some slumbering primordial deity. Proboscoid derricks pierce the sediment in their hundreds, gluttonously sucking up the earth's bounty to feed the world's limitless thirst for petroleum. It is strange, absurd even, to think that the most valuable commodity in the world, and, indeed, the grease that spins society's cogs is little more than the corpses of prehistoric flora. And yet, every day, America burns through uncountable tons of this ancient biomass, without which our nation would grind to a screeching halt.\n\nPerhaps the only thing in the Middle East older than the land itself is the people. They wandered the sands for a thousand generations before the first city, and will surely do so again after the fall of the last. Entrenched in their ancient ways, they fought and married each other for millennia in the neverending dance of civilization, and every so often, as the years ground by, the cradle of humanity exploded into sudden and ferocious violence.\n\nOnce more, blood is spilled on the sand. Under the Italian boot for decades, the Arabs have risen up to form the nascent United Arab Republic, intent on expelling the foreigners from their homeland and taking claim of their own destiny. As the Italians desperately try to stop the spread of rebellion, the Saudi king watches from Riyadh, perhaps seeing his opportunity to grip the region in an iron fist.\n\nOur diplomatic staff, terrified of the distant explosions and gunfire they can hear from their offices, have been sending in frantic reports on the escalating crisis. Reading between the lines, the central message is clear: our oil supply is threatened. The situation appears bleak. America may soon find itself deprived of oil unless we act, soon and decisively. As the Middle East embroils itself in bloodshed, the policy-makers in Washington debate about what action to take, and our men in the Middle East are airlifted to safety, one thing is certain: it is happening again."
USA.oilcrisis.1.a:0 "The wheel of ages turns once more."

USA.oilcrisis.2.t:0 "Capital Is Commodities"
USA.oilcrisis.2.desc:0 "Wall Street is the heart of the American economy, and today it's beating harder than ever. Turmoil erupted on the trading floor after our plan to set prices on oil became public, and what can only be described as mass hysteria ensued as traders followed the trail of current events to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, realizing the way the wind was blowing.\n\nThankfully it proved to be a minor hiccup, and the chaos on the trading floor quickly died down. Despite the initial hullabaloo, setting prices on oil has allowed us to maintain control of Wall Street and keep the markets relatively stable, averting the economic disaster many of our advisors were certain was imminent.\n\nOf course, we've made a lot of people angry. Commodities traders in particular are unsurprisingly furious, but the anger of a gang of hair-gelled smooth-talking champagne-drinkers is a small price to pay to avoid economic meltdown."
USA.oilcrisis.2.a:0 "Sell, sell, sell!"

USA.oilcrisis.3.t:0 "A Momentary Embolism"
USA.oilcrisis.3.desc:0 "Looming disaster has been avoided, for now, and oil flows again freely through America's veins thanks to our oil rationing and price-setting and the expansion of our domestic petroleum industry. Now our citizens can once again drive to their dead-end jobs and heat up their TV dinners without fear of impediment!\n\nAnd thank goodness for that, because without oil America would come apart like a house of cards in a tropical typhoon. Nevertheless, we can't let ourselves become complacent. The turmoil in the Middle East doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon, and although the brunt of the crisis has been averted for the time being, if the violence escalates we can expect a similarly chaotic impact on America's markets. Our oil supplies are already stretched pretty far, and the worse it gets the more draconian our response will have to be just to keep the wheels spinning.\n\nFrankly, the reports coming in from our men in the Middle East are getting bleaker by the day. Oil distribution is still far from secure, and it appears as if none of the players have the power to end this conflict quickly. Most worryingly, we've just received a report from the CIA about several UAR nations joining into a single political entity, but who's to say if it's accurate? All kinds of rumours are pouring in, and it's getting more and more difficult to separate the truth from the baseless gossip.\n\nRight now there's no way to tell which way the wind is blowing, and that kind of uncertainty isn't good for anyone. We'll have to wait and see, but at least it seems the worst has been avoided.\n\nFor now."

USA.oilcrisis.4.t:0 "Our Man in Riyadh"
USA.oilcrisis.4.desc:0 "As the airplane's doors opened, the heat hit Bruce in the face like a nuclear blast. To a Minnesota boy used to freezing winters and mild summers, it was like stepping into a kiln. Christ, he knew it was going to be hot but this was something else. Lucifer himself would sweat in this.\n\nBruce gathered his resolve and started down the airstair to the scorching tarmac of the runway. He could already feel his shirt moistening and, after only a few seconds in Riyadh, he understood instantly why the Arabs wore those billowing robes.\n\nParked ostentatiously in the middle of the airstrip was a Rolls Royce, dark green as far as he could tell through the light reflecting blindingly off the chassis. The chauffeur opened the rear door. Bruce gave him a nod and ducked inside.\n\nGod is merciful: it was air-conditioned. Hell's bells, thought Bruce, an air-conditioned car is a luxury even back in the States and here's one in the middle of the damn desert. Sitting opposite him, and flanked by two extremely large bodyguards, was Crown Prince Khalid, swathed in enough white cloth to sew a sail for a Spanish treasure galleon. He shook Khalid's hand as the Crown Prince scrutinised him through his aviator sunglasses and responded to his pleasantries in impeccable English. "A pleasure, Mr. Laingen," he said, although his face betrayed little.\n\nAs they were driven to the Palace, Bruce and the Crown Prince stiltedly discussed the region's ongoing conflict, Bruce assuring the Prince of America's unwavering commitment to Saudi Arabia in the face of the crisis. Nevertheless, as the two discussed the merits of this or that policy, Bruce couldn't get the Rolls Royce out of his head. This man is driven in a Rolls, he thought, when his grandfather rode a camel. Would his grandson also drive a Rolls, or would the House of Saud once again ride camels over Arabia's shifting sands?"
USA.oilcrisis.4.a:0 "How long can they conjure money from the desert?"

USA.oilcrisis.5.t:0 "Smoke on the Wind"
USA.oilcrisis.5.desc:0 "Bruce Laingen sat resting his head on his palm, reading and re-reading the communique from Washington. He'd been ensconced in the American embassy for days, drafting policy plans in the searing heat, ceiling fans going full bore. They often revolved so fast he was half-afraid they'd spin off their axes and decapitate him. Frankly, now he'd received his orders, he was almost starting to hope for it.\n\nWith a sigh, he called in Agent Hunt, one of the latest concrete cowboys Langley had sent him. Like most Agency men in the field, Hunt was a red-blooded American with a taste for beer, football and shooting foreigners. Bruce had an almost instantaneous dislike for the man, but if they were going to be forced to work together, they may as well try and be civil. After all, personality conflicts aside, they were striving for the same goal. Bruce lit a cigarette, and offered one to Hunt. He tossed the communique over to Hunt's side of the desk.\n\n"The President's decided to put boots on the ground," he said laconically, in a carefully neutral tone of voice. He had become paranoid lately that his office might be bugged, by either the Saudis or the Agency, and did not want to give them any indication that he was doubting the efficacy of the slowly escalating policy of interventionism in the Middle East.\n\nHunt glanced over the document, then flicked his eyes to Bruce's. "We'd better get ready then, is what you're saying," he said, a barely perceptible grin on his face.\n\nBruce nodded. "Get everyone organized, the first of them are gonna be here pretty damn soon and we're nowhere near ready to receive them. And for god's sake, get Frank to keep the Saudis off my damn back!"\n\nHunt stood, and flashed Bruce a pearly white smile as he made for the door. "Hot damn, it's gonna be just like another South Africa!""

He found it darkly amusing to see the normally so uptight Saudis sitting around smoking, drinking and groping dancing girls, all the vices they spent so much hypocritical breath decrying.\n\nThe King himself had apparently been handsome in his youth, but Bruce couldn't see any evidence of it now. Surrounded by giggling wives and concubines a third of his age, the King was bloated, droopy and covered in liver spots. He reminded Bruce of a scoop of rum and raisin ice cream that had been left sitting in the sun.\n\nAnd yet, despite all outward appearances, King Faisal was one of the shrewdest political operators he'd ever met. The man was wily as a fox.\n\nBruce noticed suddenly that the King was looking in his direction. He beckoned for Bruce to come to him at the other end of the table, and Bruce went without hesitation. When the King beckons, you come.\n\nThe King liked to project an urbane aura when speaking to Westerners, but Bruce could detect the hint of menace lurking beneath the King's friendly facade. "My dear Mr. Laingen! I did not know you were here. A pleasure to see you once again in the Palace! I trust things are progressing at the Embassy?"\n\nSneaky bastard, thought Bruce. He knows full well I was on the guest list. His reply, however, was far more deferential. "Yes, your majesty. Our defence and intelligence network has been thoroughly established. Our agents are at your disposal to root out the traitors to your rule."\n\nThe King smiled, but his eyes were as cold and immovable as a glacier. "My dear Bruce, I must commend you!

German diplomats have made their nation's displeasure clear, calling us hypocrites for running operations in the no-fly zone. Germany's opposition, of course, does not come from a love of peace but from a desire to protect their sometime-allies in the pan-Arabist movement, presumably afraid that an unfriendly faction taking control of the region could throttle their oil supply.\n\nUltimately, what do we care what they think? Germany is unlikely to put boots on the ground in the Middle East in order to avoid a confrontation, and, after all, we're in desperate need of the oil too. Better we pump it into America rather than allow it to grease the gears of the cruellest superpower in history."

USA.oilcrisis.9.desc:0 "You'd have to be a damn fool to trust the Saudis, but they're the only native group in the region even slightly friendly to the US. Nobody could say that they were reliable, but having the Saudis on our side gives us a valuable beachhead into the Middle East to protect exports of precious, precious oil.\n\nNevertheless, the values of Saudi Arabia are distasteful even to the most hardline reactionaries back home, and it's getting increasingly difficult to justify our alignment with a nation so diametrically opposed to the virtues of freedom and liberty that Americans hold dear. It's hard to see the Saudis as the lesser of two evils when they deny women even the most basic rights and behead political and religious prisoners like some kind of medieval warlord. Some commentators back home are even comparing the pan-Arabists to the American revolutionaries of the 18th century, which, presumably, would cast us in the role of King George.\n\nIf we're going to back the Saudis, it's our responsibility to try and nudge them away from hardline conservative Salafism. The idea of a republican or, Allah forgive me for uttering this word, secular Arabia is a pipe dream, but if we carefully influence Saudi thought leaders we can perhaps engender positive social change in Arabia and avoid the mistakes of the old apartheid regime in Guyana.\n\nThe CIA's current plan is a covert operation to influence the hearts and minds of Saudi Arabians who might be sympathetic to our ideals, mainly non-Salafist intellectuals and the petit bourgeois. The Saudi upper crust would balk at sudden change, but perhaps over the next few decades of our association with them we can nudge the oil kingdom in a brighter direction."

Every war creates refugees, but the sudden brutality of the conflict in the Middle East is annihilating ancient ways of life and sending people fleeing from the land their ancestors have occupied for centuries in a way never seen before, and they're all flocking to what appears to be the last remaining beacon of stability in the region: the Saudi Kingdom.\n\nMost of them aren't exactly friendly to Saudi or Western interests, but more than that, they fear and hate the men who expelled them from their homes. As the pan-Arabists spread their tentacles over more and more of the Middle East, that hate could be a powerful weapon against an increasingly dangerous enemy.\n\nOur man in Riyadh, veteran diplomat Bruce Laingen, has presented us with a plan drawn up by two CIA operatives under his command, Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt. It suggests training and arming the refugees and sending them back into the fray as a totally deniable army to fight the pan-Arabists without smearing red, white and blue across the Middle East. If it seems like we're uninvolved, the local response will likely be far more amenable to a native army whose interests just happen to coincide with our own. This could be a way for us to exert our influence in the region without having to send our boys to die in the desert."

The towering date palms let very little light into the courtyard, and in the twilight it was filled with a dim purple glow. By a shimmering pool sat King Faisal, sipping coffee from a silver goblet.\n\nThe King motioned for Bruce to sit. At some unspoken signal the garden was suddenly empty. The King set his coffee down and gazed into the pool. At last he began to speak, not looking up.\n\n"America is a young country, is it not? Forged in the fires of revolution some two centuries past. Indeed, the very ideals that drive your nation are scarcely older than America itself."\n\nHe glanced up to meet Bruce's eyes, and Bruce shuddered in the coldness of his gaze. "We are an old culture. The legacy of the Arab people goes back far further than your own, our way of life is founded on values and ideals millennia older than yours. Our faith in God is the driving force behind our society, tradition its cornerstone. You must come to understand this or someday the desert will consume you as it has so many others."\n\nThe garden darkened as the sun slipped below the horizon. "I love to sit here after the rain," confided the King, leaning back in his chair and folding his hands over his belly. "The coolness after a storm is a rare pleasure in Riyadh. Imagine the hubris to construct a garden such as this! This palace and its garden will be here long after America has crumbled into the sands of time, and the ways of our people will exist as unchanged in the years to come as they have for so many centuries." He glanced over at Bruce. "I hope you understand."\n\nBruce heard the message loud and clear: the King wanted an end to the CIA's program of liberalization. Heart in his throat, he felt a sudden burst of fury at the veiled threats of this decrepit old wreck. "Your people once built great gardens in Cordoba, your majesty, before the forces of Christendom burned them to the ground. You should consider the fate of the Moors before you make threats."\n\nWith that he rose, and left the King to sit alone in the twilit darkness of his garden."

They've even held several secret meetings with the ones most sympathetic to their degenerate views.\n\nFaith and tradition are the cornerstones of our society, without them we are nothing. We're perfectly happy to accept American money and American guns, but they can keep their corrupt values. It's time we identify those they've influenced and make sure they're silenced. The Americans can hardly just pull their aid, not when they're as oil-starved as they are, and that might be all we need to put an end to the toxic ideas spewing forth from the American embassy.\n\nOur ways have survived the long ages and a parade of conquerors, whose bones lie forgotten under the sands while we carry on.

Our new planes are set to soon arrive at Port Dammam, and our boys in Riyadh have already drawn up plans for ambitious missions against the pan-Arabist menace.\n\nWe don't plan to let the Middle East and its oil escape our grasp just 'cause the limp-wrists back home balk at the idea of dropping a few million tons of bombs on people who are fighting, as we once did, for their freedom, liberty and right to self-determination.

Our supply of oil is not ensured, while our enemies in the region are starved of their main source of funding.\n\nNow that we've got a good, tight stranglehold over outgoing trade, we can throttle the enemy until they're crying uncle.

USA.oilcrisis.15.desc:0 "Bruce sipped at his drink of choice, a Long Island iced tea, as Agent Hunt sat across from him in his sweltering office, telling him in furiously animated detail of how the Saudi police have begun to harass American operatives, irrespective of whether or not they're involved in the liberalization program. The icy cold drink and the frantically rotating ceiling fans did little to cool him down.\n\nAfter Hunt left in a huff, swearing that something had to be done about "those damn slimy Arabs", Bruce sat back, wondering what was to be done. He got up and walked to the window, flicking open the Venetian blinds. Past the low, white buildings of Riyadh he could see the endless desert expanse, stretching all the way out into the scorching nothingness of the Empty Quarter. The view reminded him often of what Minnesota might look like if it was covered in sand. Like Arabia, the only round things in Minnesota were the fruit on the trees and some of the people.\n\nAnd yet, despite the similarity of the land they inhabited, the people of Minnesota and Arabia couldn't have been more different. He often found himself unable to understand why the locals did anything they did, why they held onto these bizarre, archaic beliefs. It was like living in a kingdom from the Dark Ages that had been dumped into the twentieth century.\n\nBruce closed the blinds and went to sit back behind his desk, slumping into the chair, still moist with his sweat. The authoritarian Saudi police would have to be dealt with if Americans were to operate unrestricted through the country. The Saudis would hate it, of course, and he had little doubt that the King and the Crown Prince would try every possible tactic to keep the status quo, but if they didn't stop harassing American operatives they'd feel the wrath of Uncle Sam.\n\nHe took a page and began to draft up some ideas to handle the situation, narrowing it down to two main contenders: play nice with the Saudis, maybe throw them a bone or two, or serve them a veiled threat by reminding them that America could pull out and cut off their lifeline if they didn't get back over the line."

Bruce had spent the morning in a series of meetings with a rotating gang of Saudi officials, ministers of one sort or another, all of whom looked exactly the same: portly, bearded men wearing aviator sunglasses and enough white cloth to make a hot air balloon. Bruce was forced to repeat himself with each one of them: reform their authoritarian and overzealous police force, or suffer a reduction in American funding.\n\nTheir reaction was invariably the same. It consisted of a brief explanation of the importance in the kingdom of Sharia law, tradition, faith, yadda yadda. All stuff he'd heard before, and like before he found it impossible to believe after seeing what the Saudi upper crust were like behind closed doors. When he had requested to meet with the King, or the Crown Prince, he was told blankly that they were not receiving visitors. Frankly, he wasn't surprised he was on the King's shit-list after their little confrontation in the garden, but now he couldn't even talk to him?\n\nSo the Saudis wanted to play hardball did they? Well, two could play at that game. Back in his stifling office, Bruce wondered how to deal with them. God knew he wanted to turn the screws on the bastards, but the angel on his shoulder was being very insistent in telling him to take the high road and back off. Even so, he couldn't shake off his anger at their condescension, brushing him off like he wasn't threatening to throttle their aid. He narrowed his eyes. Surely they had to be bluffing...?"

He swung to his terrified secretary, a cringing suburbanite from Long Island. "Get the hell out!" he spat. She vanished from the room faster than Bruce's hopes for a quiet day without trouble from the Saudis.\n\nBruce slumped into his chair, the leather instantly sticking his shirt to his back. It was the Chinese, he recalled, who cursed people by wishing them to live in interesting times. The Saudis were making his life extremely interesting indeed. His attempt to intimidate the Saudis by threatening to pull out had been a complete and utter failure. He could almost feel Faisal and Khalid and the rest of the aviator-wearing bastards laughing at him in the Palace.\n\nBruce laid his head in his hands. The Saudis knew America needed them, and they knew America was desperate for oil. He was supposed to be working them, and yet somehow they'd maneuvered him into a corner. Faisal was calling the shots now, and he had sent a letter filled with extremely thinly veiled threats, in essence a demand for the CIA's social liberalization program to be discontinued and for American interference in Saudi internal politics to be immediately halted. There was the suggestion that further interference could result in a butterfly effect leading to a halt in oil shipments to the United States. It didn't take a genius to read between the lines there.\n\nWell, Bruce thought, they've sure got us over a barrel here. He sighed. After all, what did he care about democracy in the Middle East? As long as the oil kingdom kept up the shipments, Washington would be happy."

The usual suspects, in other words.\n\nBruce plastered a smile on his face, hoping he didn't look too ingenuous. After their tiff in the garden, he was surprised but glad the King had agreed to meet with him. He may have grown to hate the slippery, corpulent warlord, but god knows America needed a stable oil-exporting ally in the region, and the Saudis were just about the only option.\n\nAfter the stilted pleasantries, the real discussion began, both sides trying to get as much as possible from their opponent while giving up as little as possible, the endless dance of diplomacy, negotiating and bargaining. Bruce was in his element. Determined to control himself, he gave the Saudis several minor concessions they wanted. It seemed to make them happy, but with the Saudis it was difficult to tell.\n\nFinally, after over an hour of dancing around it, the central point came up at last. Bruce's attempts to play nice with the Saudis had at least gotten his foot in the door, and now it was time to wedge the door open or forever give it up. As much as they pretended at supreme military dominance, Bruce knew the Saudi military was far from the juggernaut the King wished he had at his disposal. He could, of course, just play it cool, restore friendly relations and avoid further embarrassment... or, he considered, he could offer them the weapons agreement he knew they wanted. If a bunch of new toys couldn't mollify Faisal and get him to cooperate, Bruce reflected grimly, it was probable nothing would."

Next would be the tanks, and the helicopters, and the cargo loads of guns, explosives, yadda yadda.\n\nHe drew the blinds and sat down. The King was signing the laws to put a leash on his overzealous police force and to allow a few token liberalizations in a closed ceremony in the Palace. It hadn't even made the news, which Bruce was sure wasn't an accident. Along with the seemingly endless materiel, the Saudis were getting millions more in aid and development funds siphoned by the Agency's oh-so-clever accountants in Washington.\n\nAs he listened to the trucks rumble past, Bruce blackly sipped his coffee. When he thought about it, the Saudis had gotten a hell of a lot more out of his agreement than he'd managed to get for America. He felt like a customer in a bazaar who thought he'd gotten a great bargain out of a haggle but had actually gotten swindled. He'd been warned Faisal was an infamous political operator, and yet somehow along the way Bruce had let him get the better of him. He supposed he'd had a chance to get the upper hand at some point, but he must have missed it. He almost had to admire them for it. Almost.\n\nFaisal and Khalid and the rest of them must be having a good laugh up at the Palace at having got one over on that degenerate heathen American. And yet, what could he possibly have done? America needed the Saudis on their side, for better or for worse. Anything as long as it kept the oil flowing.\n\nFinishing his coffee, Bruce sighed, and hoped it wouldn't be long until he could go home to the snowy plains of Minnesota, and never have to step foot in the desert again."

After a minute, he realized they weren't coming back.\n\nAs he was driven back to the embassy, Bruce sat in the back seat in the depths of a fell mood, his every muscle tensed. When he had offered a new weapons agreement to the King in exchange for token liberalizations and further cooperation from his government, the King had sneered, calling the United States weak and decadent. His ministers and the Crown Prince rising with him, King Faisal had declared that he would never compromise the deeply held beliefs and values of the Arabian people to appease America, especially not for what he deemed a "bribe". The King left sneering, cursing Americans as servants of Mammon.\n\nBruce was fuming. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was somehow personal, the King's retaliation for the harsh words they had exchanged in the garden. Could the man really be so vain that he would sacrifice such a one-sided deal for something so petty? Perhaps he had underestimated Faisal and his coterie.\n\nOf course, this didn't mark the end of America's association with the Saudis. They had become entangled into a frankly dangerous symbiotic relationship, the Saudis relying on America's military power and influence, and the Americans on Saudi oil. And here he was, Bruce Laingen of Butterfield, Minnesota, somehow caught up in the middle of it.\n\nGoddamn it all, he thought. All he could do now was try to satisfy Washington without rocking the boat too much. It was clear now that there would never be democracy in the Middle East if they were unwilling to give up their medieval practices. As long as the oil kept flowing Stateside, it would be enough.\n\nBruce leaned back into the richly upholstered leather, and dreamed of returning to the snowy fields of Minnesota."

Whether from rigs off the Louisiana coast or the bountiful wells in the Arabian Peninsula, cheap oil is the linchpin keeping the world's strongest economy strong from the bottom up.\n\nThen one sunny day in the turn of the decade, oil prices quadruple to $12 a barrel. And like an engine with neither lubricant nor fuel, the world's strongest economy sputters into a sudden stop. Pandemonium strikes Wall Street's floors as indexes dovetail past their troughs with no signs of slowing down, let alone stopping. Main Street fares little better: look only at the miles-long lines of cars outside gas stations across the country, both awaiting shipments of fuel that will never come. As conflagrations spark abroad, the crisis they have brought to America's shores have skyrocketed the prices of goods while simultaneously keeping people from earning money for them - in other words, a cataclysm poised to stunt, even reverse, a decade of growth.\n\nAmerica turns desperately to Capitol Hill for an answer to the world's first ever oil shock.

Their inability to contain, or at least moderate, the Arab people's unrest has caused wave after wave of disruptions to the world's largest supplier of cheap sweet crude oil. With Congress near-unanimous in their apathy for the ailing and aloof empire's miserable fortunes, Washington has decided that supporting the movements to break the peninsula free from Rome's talons will most help in stabilizing the region and, in turn, its oil wells.\n\nStill, even proponents of pro-Arab intervention are divided over both its extents and its recipient. Vigorous debate has sprung over whether America should lend its hand to Yasser Arafat's Baathists in the United Arab Republic, or to the influential House of Saud and its patriarch King Faisal. If ambiguous over said hand's size, shape and delivery, then President [Root.GetName] has at least settled the prior argument by deciding in favor of..."

His agents have noticed a steady increase in anti-war rhetoric: newspapers, radio broadcasts and several opposition politicians are criticizing the choice to send "our boys" to "die in the jungles and quagmires of a god-forsaken hell" and, while the tones are still kept civil, small non-violent protests and marches are breaking up in counties where the draft has been felt more extensively.\n\nWhile the effects of such propaganda are still limited, the report considers "very likely" that a prosecution of the hostilities with the Afrika-Schild will only worsen the current state of affairs, and urges "immediate gains" to quell the discontent, or we'll risk facing a severely worse situation in the next months."

USA.saf.effects.4.desc:0 "The village had no name. On the US maps of the area, it was called Hamlet 773. Like so many others, It was a squalid collection of huts whose inhabitants made their meagre living by grazing cattle. It would forever have avoided the pages of history, if it wasn't for one ill-fated patrol.\n\nAnd so, in the baking heat of the afternoon, they came. A group of American soldiers strode into Hamlet 773, guns out. It had been months since any Americans had come their way, and they all came out to see them. Their leader was a boy with pimples on his face. He indicated the oldest man present, the village elder, and began to shout at him, his voice cracking, his pale face growing red.\n\nThe elder, unable to speak English, tried to figure out what he wanted, but the boy soon lost patience. He shouted at his troops, and they moved into the huts, ransacking them. As the elder approached the American to ask him to stop, the boy struck him to the ground. Lights swam behind the elder's eyes as he wiped the blood from his face. He could hear shouting, in Tswana and English. Looking through clouded eyes, he saw a group of women approach the boy, pointing at him and yelling. The elder tried to entreat them to calm, but the words died in his throat.\n\nEverything after that happened so suddenly. A girl ran from the group. She didn't get five paces before a shot rang through the air and she dropped like a ragdoll. The elder tried to rise, fell. Shots tore through the air above him. Silence. Then the wailing began.\n\nIt hadn't taken more than ten seconds. Gathering what little remained of his strength, the elder rose to his knees. Twisted bodies lay everywhere. Women, children. The American boy was shouting, his voice cracking. The elder looked back to his people, the few still upright keening, wide-eyed with horror. He began to crawl, but felt his spirit fading, like a cloud passing into the distance. Fainter, fainter..."

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal craft came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and flames rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from them. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any conqueror of antiquity. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. The helicopters left back through the smoke, leaving the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten."

Backed by the bleak vastness of the sky, the weary Americans passed through the kraal.\n\nIt was barely a village, a collection of shacks made of rubbish and dry wood, a handful of emaciated goats and sheep who gazed forlornly on the men as they made their way into the centre of the feeble settlement. Their leader, a boy with patchy fuzz on his upper lip, looked around him into the houses, and saw in the gaps between planks the sullen red faces sneering at him with the hateful eyes of the conquered.\n\nEvacuate, he called, once, twice. They only glared and snarled in their pig-speech, and the boy felt his anger stoked at their contempt. Forward, he motioned, and the masked men approached with their strange machines, and the villagers watched them in confusion.\n\nWithout further warning, fire poured forth and the shacks went up in flames. Screaming, they began to flee, clutching babies and valuables, crashing to the ground as shots ripped through the air, tearing into their sunburned skin in fountains of blood.\n\nWithin minutes, the all-consuming fire had cleansed the village from the face of the earth. All that remained was the ash, and the bodies, and the boy-commander gazing upon the destruction he had wrought with faraway eyes. Sifting through the remains, the Americans found no evidence of the hidden Boer cache they had come so far to find. As dry thunder boomed over the highveld, they turned and returned the way they had come, between the jagged rocks, back down the sandy road."

The mud was littered with corpses- children, women, old men. There didn't seem to be any of draft-age, or any with weapons.\n\nThompson ordered the helicopter to land in the centre of the village, where he could see a few Americans milling about. He disembarked and, as he approached the nearest private, he was startled by an African woman stumbling from a nearby hut, naked, groaning, blood running down her legs. A shot rang out. Her head blew apart in a fountain of brain matter and skull fragments. The woman's body slammed to the dirt in a pool of gore.\n\nA man came out from the hut, stepping over the corpse, one hand holding his pistol and the other doing up his zipper. "Who's in charge here?" demanded Thompson.\n\n"That'd be me", said the soldier, unaffected. "Name's Calley. You our relief?" Thompson stared at him in horror as an enfilade of shots rang out behind him, at the other end of the village. He got into Calley's unshaken face. "Just what in the hell is going on here, Lieutenant?"\n\n"Just following orders," replied Calley, "giving these niggers a taste of American firepower."\n\n"But- these are unarmed civilians, human beings, sir!" More shots. Thompson winced. Calley lit a cigarette. "Look buddy, this is my show. I'm in charge here. If you ain't interested in doing your damn job why don't you fuck off back to your chopper and mind your own business?"\n\nThompson carefully glanced around. Calley's men were staring at him, slowly moving towards him from the sides, surrounding him. "You ain't heard the last of this!", he snarled impotently as he stepped back into the helicopter. Raising over the village, he saw a group of soldiers push a handful of girls and old men into a ditch and open fire.\n\nThompson desperately tried to raise the Colonel on the radio, receiving only static.

Blonde hair, blue eyes, the German pedigree. The rags of his uniform identified him as an officer of the SS. A shot to the spine had left him paralyzed below the waist, and he had laid there since the battle in a pool of his own filth, drinking tainted rainwater from the mud and praying for a clean death. He would not get it.\n\nThe German fumbled for his gun as he saw the Americans approach, but they got to him first. It was all the excuse they needed. The men of Tiger Force tied cables around his legs and attached them to the back of the APC, then took him on a spin through the grime of the battlefield, dragging him over the ruined bodies of his comrades, through the congealed gore. First he shouted, then he screamed, then he begged and cried and called for his Mutti, and finally he was silent.\n\nAt a sharp turn, his head was dashed against a rock, shattering his skull, his brain matter splattering across the mud.

He braced himself for what he knew was coming.\n\nNow that he had awoken, the torture began anew. One of the men punched him full force in the stomach and the chest, over and over again as the other watched, asking questions he didn't know the answers to. After a time, the torturer went to wash his hands clean while the Boer spat blood onto the concrete floor. It glistened in the harsh yellow glare of the sodium lights.\n\nNext came the pliers. He was determined not to scream, but his resolve broke immediately as the frowning torturer ripped out his thumbnail. The questioner continued in his monotonous drone, speaking the Afrikaans of one who had not been born to it. Where were they, how many were there, where were the supplies coming from. All the Boer could say was that he did not know, but they were not satisfied. After his remaining fingernails were lying on the floor in pools of blood, the torturer went to work on his teeth.\n\nAfter a time, the Boer awoke. He wondered how much time had passed in the dank, stinking cellar. The torturer wheeled a car battery forward and attached jumper cables to it, then clipped the clamps to his nipples. The Boer felt electricity light his brain up like a Christmas tree. For a moment the shock was so strong he didn't even feel the pain, but it came. Oh, it came. When he proved once again unable to answer their questions, the torturer swapped the clamps to his testicles.\n\nEventually, morning came. In an alley in Cape Town, down by the docks, a nondescript door opened. A young man with slicked-back red hair walked outside into the dim sunlight, rolling his shoulders and stretching his neck. Behind him, he awkwardly dragged a garbage bag, the contents sloshing around with every step. He heaved it into an already overflowing dumpster, and, shielding his eyes from morning's bright light, made his way back inside.\n\nSoon, they would be bringing in the next prisoner."

Tanks, helicopters and all kinds of weapons and explosives were littered across the continent in abandoned camps. Among this bounty, claimed by the Americans, was the Germans' invisible killer: poison gas.\n\nAs the men of Tiger Force advanced across the savannah, they ransacked many such camps, eventually coming into possession of a sizable stock of gas grenades, which they carried around with them, itching to find some krauts to use them on.\n\nIt was a regular patrol, to yet another of the half-empty hamlets that dotted the savannah. Their radio was on the fritz again, so as they milled around waiting for new orders, they decided to play a game: see how far away they could chuck a gas grenade into the village's well.\n\nA ruddy-faced corporal eventually managed it at ten paces. As the grenade clattered down into the well, they heard the pin get ripped out and the hiss of the gas filling the well as the grenade sunk into the water.\n\nAn old African approached them, yelling, repeating "Poison, poison!" over and over again. With a sneer the corporal shoved him to the dirt, his buddies laughing. Their laughter was cut short as more villagers came out of their huts, first curious to see what all the fuss was about, then furious. The elder stood, his nose bloodied, and began to shout at them. The other villagers were shouting too, closing in.\n\nWhen they stood before the panel at their disciplinary hearing, every man of Tiger Force said they didn't know who had fired the first shot, or who had thrown the poison grenade into the village's only source of water. Nevertheless, when the smoke had cleared, the ground was littered with shattered corpses. The few survivors were evacuated from their ancestral lands and, as the days went by, the plants and animals withered and died as the poison spread through the soil.

Acknowledging, he set the wheels of destruction in motion. If he had given it any thought he would have assumed they were carrying weapons or enemy troops, but he didn't think, or, more likely, simply didn't care. It is easy to deal death from a distance, never having to look into the enemy's eyes, hear them cry and scream and beg for mercy.\n\nThe bombs screamed downward, whistling through the air, but the pilot didn't hear them. Before their impact, there was a moment of peace that seemed to stretch for an eternity, where everything was locked where it was. Then the explosions blasted across the savannah, blowing apart the trucks in an eruption of twisted metal.\n\nSatisfied with a job well done, the pilot turned back to base. He would never see the villagers running to the shattered remains of the convoy, horrified to see their shipment of vital supplies obliterated, not a scrap remaining, and the road torn apart, their only lifeline to the outside world.\n\nHe would never see the children starving, the people dying of curable disease, the death and agony of their eventual migration away from their ancestral lands, desperate to survive. That flash of metal in the sky, sighted above the village for a split second, had forever decided their destinies, destroying lives, wiping a whole community from the map, but the man who had pushed the button would know none of this.

Some held photos of husbands, children, brothers whose bodies - lost in the jungle or mangled beyond recognition - they couldn't even hold for a last goodbye, others posters decrying the "useless sacrifice" of human lives and accusing the "bloodthirsty capitalists" who "feed on death" to be the true force behind the government's decision to increase the draft.\n\nThe guards outside were visibly in difficulty: they surrounded the small crowd, but didn't try to dislodge them as they were unarmed and quiet. They didn't scream or try to force the block: they all waited there, and looked at a certain window, where a certain person was looking back.

It was a long, brutal and bloody war, costing the lives of many of our best and brightest who served their country, and with a bill that will make the budget bleed for a generation or more. While it wasn't a full on defeat, it's hard to claim a victory, as much as President [USA.GetLeader] and his supporters try to spin it. Sure, South Africa still exists and can hold free and fair-elections, but the three Reichskommisariats have strengthened their position in Africa, and have established an allied-Boer Republic, reducing our ally to a rump state.\n\nThe result has seen the American people bitterly divided: all the sacrifice that had been made to keep South Africa free and defeat the Nazi's was apparently wasted, as South Africa is now smaller and weaker, and the RK's are stronger than ever. If just another division had been sent earlier, or more bombing runs had been launched, or just a bit more effort had been made, then the war would have gone differently, and we wouldn't be left with this unsatisfying, and unstable victory. Others say we should have cut and run sooner, so the casualties and news reports of dead soldiers and brunt villages didn't cause the public morale collapse, or resulted in the deaths of many young men. The what-ifs and could-have-beens, however, will have to be left to the historians and the President's political opponents to fight over in the future.\n\nWhile the fighting is over for now, it's clear that South Africa will need our assistance and help to survive, and to maintain a toehold in Africa."

At the same time, the OFN was unable to erase the stain of Fascism from Africa, so the status quo remains.\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] maintains that the goal of the intervention in Africa was just this: protecting our allies and "containing" Nazism to it's current borders and preventing it from spreading like a disease around the world. However, many politicians and generals stated their desire to drive the fascists back, and liberate all of sub-saharan Africa from our ideological opponents. While these words were more hopeful than concrete policy goals, a decent chunk of the general public that had heard time and time again that America was fighting for democracy and freedom are not content with what some are calling a "half-finished war." While no one is exactly saying that they want to go right back to war and utterly destroy the RK's as the troops are arriving home, except maybe a few warhawks on the fringes of Congress, there is a listlessness and dissatisfaction that pervades the population over the stalemate.\n\nNevertheless, with South Africa intact and free, and the dominos stopped before they fall, we can be satisfied, if not enthusiastic, about the outcome."

However, President [USA.GetLeader], in comments made at the White House Press Briefing, stated that "...the US and OFN have accomplished all their goals in the fight in South Africa. The Reichskommisariats have had their capabilities dismantled, our ally is secure, and we've liberated many of the subject peoples of Nazi tyranny." However the President and his supporters will have to answer for why they let the Nazis get away, and let them rule over much reduced territories.

The central compound of the colonial government was the last sector of the city to fall, as almost two hundred soldiers, supported by a battalion of the native SS, had bunkered in the heavily-fortified building, forcing the American troops to clear the underground corridors and booby-trapped halls with flamethrowers and military engineers.\n\nThe last weeks had seen the combined Allied troops inflicting defeat after defeat against the Reichskommissariat, steadily gaining ground against a weakened and demoralized opponent, but this might be the turning point for the war: with the fall of Windhoek, the Schild has lost its largest air fields, and large supplies fuel and airplane parts have been seized by the attackers before the Germans could retreat.\n\nReikscommissar Schenck has managed to flee the city on his personal fighter, and in his first statement he has sworn "to bring back the German flag to Windhoek ", but with the western front in disarray and Schild troops still retreating, many doubt whether he'll be able to keep faith to his word."

Troops from the entire coalition attacked with fierceness bordering desperation, and despite heavy losses managed to push the frontline until the South Africans and their American allies had to fall back to the outskirts of the city.\n\nIt was immediately evident how ill-prepared had been the defenders, as they never thought the Germans would actually be able to react to the last defeat. Bombing runs from Südwestafrikaner pilots, eager to get revenge for the humiliation, quickly neutralized the scattered anti-aircraft batteries and proceeded to hammer the garrison with all kinds of payloads. Rather than suffering heavy losses, the commander preferred to retreat from the city, and convoys filled with soldiers and supplies quickly left the cities the night before the attack.\n\nThe following day, the German troops entered the liberated Windhoek in triumph, though the locals seemed less than happy to welcome their saviors. Reichskommissar Schenck returned to the city hailed by his soldiers, and resumed his post in the administrative compound, now under heavy repairs. The victory has been broadcasted all the way to Germania, and reinvigorated the morale of the Afrika-Schild.

Despite the valiant efforts of the Boer soldiers, they couldn't resist the impetus, and were forced back to the city center. There, they found many defensive positions sabotaged by ANC partisans, which eventually forced the commander to surrender.\n\nWith the fall of Johanasburg, the Boers have lost not only their largest settlement, but also their only developed industrial sector, effectively crippling their war production: this will make much more difficult for them to keep fighting effectively, and many agree that this might be the beginning of the end for this ill-fated uprising."

While most of the soldiers managed to retreat in order, there weren't enough transports to take in the ANC partisans, who accused the Americans of having betrayed them. As they had nowhere to run, they decided to fight to the last man rather than surrendering: they fell one by one waging a fierce guerrilla against the advancing Boers, sabotaging several industrial facilities and dealing much heavier losses than they took, until they were completely vanquished.\n\nWith the liberation of Johanasburg, the Republic has regained control of its industrial core, and reparations are already underway to bring the military production plants to full efficiency.

As the port itself was lightly defended, and most of the garrison had been sent to the front, there was little the remaining guards could do as hundreds of marines attacked in unison, and heavy naval batteries pounded what little defenses surrounded the docks.\n\nAlready, military engineers have started turning the city into a fortress with whatever they can find at hand, and the port facilities are being repaired for unknown purposes. As Zentralafrika hurries to defend its vulnerable belly, the American-led coalition has already achieved an important victory: by opening a second front directly in the heart of Deutsch-Afrika, they have managed to force their opponent to divert a significant contingent from the main front to the South, severely weakening their frontline.

Before the Americans could reinforce the disembarked naval garrison with proper ground troops, the full might of the German war machine was unleashed upon Libreville.\n\nSuddenly, he night was set ablaze by the simultaneous fire from dozens of explosions, and the few who were still asleep were forcibly torn from their dreams by the sounds of explosions and airplanes filling the sky. The marines held their ground and fought fiercely, supported by the constant barrage from the ships anchored at the docks, but they found themselves under attack by an enemy they couldn't hope to defeat: pioneers cleared the minefields and tank traps, while panzers rammed hastily-erected barricades and infantry quickly moved in to seize key points of the defensive line.\n\nThe defenders retreated in order to the port and quickly boarded their ships as they took the sea, thanks to the fact that the Germans carefully avoided bombing the port facilities; still not everyone could find place inside, and many fell in German hands.

Perhaps this was what spurred the German soldiers to fight even more fiercely than usual, or perhaps it was desperation, but in the end the result didn't change.\n\nThe American garrison fought in the jungles surrounding the city in a desperate attempt to hold back the enemy advance, but they were forced to retreat when the vegetation was set aflame by napalm bombings, and Zentralafrikaner helicopters hunted the scattered bands till the outskirts, where they were forced to retreat by the anti-aircraft batteries hurriedly mounted on the former central compound of the colonial administration. The symbolic value of the building didn't stop the Schild from heavily bombing it, further weakening the defenses before the final push. In the end, most of the garrison managed to leave the city before it fell by seizing several civilian boats and retreating through the lake towards their still-fighting comrades. Müller was reportedly "heartbroken" when he saw his most prized trophies used as "bedside tables and practice targets", and has sworn bitter revenge against those who perpetrated such a sacrilege.\n\nPerhaps this newfound rage will lead Zentralafrika towards a renewed impetus, but the situation remains extremely difficult for the German coalition: with large swathes of the Reichskommissariat still occupied, many doubt that the victory will do anything more than delaying the inevitable, especially with the western front still open like a festering wound.

This distraction gave the attackers the perfect opportunity to strike and, despite taking heavy losses, they managed to dislodge the garrison from the outer bastions and enter the urban areas. The last sector to fall was the fortress-complex of the central administration compound, which had been riddled with boody-traps and death zones: over six hundreds soldiers died to take the building from the few dozens of fanatical German SS barricaded there, before military engineers and flamethrower teams were sent in.\n\nQuelimane was a vital hub for the colony, and hosted several industries fundamental to the war effort: the victorious occupants were reportedly "shocked" by what they saw in the countless mining concentration camps and slave factories, where tens of thousands of desperate men, women and children lived in abject poverty and starvation: many were moved to tears as some of the weakest ones died before their very eyes, crying of happiness for being free at last.

Silently, like snakes stalking their prey with the cover of night, SS snipers surgically removed all sentinels and took position around the barracks, waiting for the signal: as soon as it arrived - a single artillery shot - the poisonous jaws closed, and slaughter began.\n\nThe defenders couldn't even take up arms as they were riddled with bullets in their beds, while the units secretly assembled in the forests surrounding the city moved in. No surrender terms were offered to the American commander: he and the few survivors were dragged from the central compound they had bunkered in, tortured for information, and summarily executed, the photos of their mangled corpses sent to the American command to show that Reichskommissar Hüttig always, ALWAYS keeps his promises.

Still, this wasn't enough to hold off the attackers, as the joint German-Boer task forces used napalm and heavy artillery to clear the outer defenses, creating a breach large enough for the close quarters specialists to reach their intended targets.

The ruse was discovered only the next day, when the Americans attacked and found almost no resistance.\n\nEven though the victory was less of a triumph than hoped for, this still comes as a success for the OFN coalition after a long time without any meaningful success. While it is clear in Washington that the war will still drag on, at least total defeat is no longer a likely outcome, which is already a result."

USA.saf.war.missions.17.desc:0 "Today, a devastating blow has been struck against South Africa as Cape Town, the Federation's capital and largest city, fell to a joint task force of Boer and Südwestafrikaner soldiers. The last weeks had seen the American-led coalition suffer defeat after defeat, losing several key settlements to the Afrika-Schild, until the front reached the very heart of the country. Now, that heart has stopped beating.\n\nThe hills surrounding the "City Bowl" were turned into fortresses linked by trench lines, fully enclosing the Cape in a ring of heavy fortifications. The city itself had extensively prepared for the coming attack, with barricades and key locations garrisoned by volunteer units, and American artillery and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the roads and squares. However, even such preparations weren't enough to resist as the entirety of the German war machine was thrown at the defenders. Boer artillery, supplied by their German allies, surgically removed a large part of the air defenses, and then Südwestafrikaner bombers unleashed hell upon the city in the form of incendiary bombings and bunker-busting payloads. Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles were riddled with craters, while Signal Hill was captured and turned into an advanced artillery position to fire directly into the inner urban areas. In the end, the pressure became too much, and the joint High Command ordered a full retreat from the city by sea.\n\nWith the fall of its capital, South Africa loses also its largest industrial center and recruitment pool, severely crippling the war effort. In Washington, the American government is currently under attack by several newspapers and prominent opposition politicians, who decry the "useless sacrifice of American lives" and ask for total disengagement from this "humiliating disaster". Meanwhile, as the ashes cool down, the new Boer military administration, helped by German personnel, has already started implementing apartheid. The South African government, evacuated from the city before the attack, has promised to retake the city, but is this still possible?"

USA.saf.war.missions.18.desc:0 "Perhaps the war isn't over yet, and there's still some fighting spirit in the South African Federation. In what came as a sudden change to the one-sided course of the war, the last reserves of the Federal army, heavily supported by elements of the American Navy and driven by determination bordering on desperation, launched a full-scale offensive against their capital.\n\nThe new occupants of the city hadn't had the time to repair the fortifications surrounding the city, and were forced to fight in ruined bunkers and half-buried trenches. At the same time, a general uprising from the population, who hadn't been taking well the newly imposed apartheid, forced the Boer command to divert several units from key locations around the ring of forts, further weakening the already too strained defenses and finally forcing a geneal retreat from the hills. With the defenders surrounded from all sides, the officer in command finally surrendered in the morning: the coalition troops entered a wounded, but jubilant city, while their enemies hurried to reach their captors before they could be lynched by the enraged mob.\n\nThis victory comes as an utterly unexpected development in a war that already defies all known parameters: the German war machine has suffered a strong blow, and the industries of Cape Town will be a boon for the South African army as soon as they are repaired, returning a modicum of autonomy to an army which now completely depends on American supplies. At this point, no one knows whether this will be the proverbial swansong before ultimate defeat, or the beginning of the comeback for the Federation."

USA.saf.war.missions.19.t:0 "Rage Against the Administration"
USA.saf.war.missions.19.desc:0 "With the war in South Africa escalating, the President has issued a new draft directed towards young able-bodied men. Tens of thousands will be requested to join the army and, after their training is over, will depart for the frontline. Everyone knows many of them won't return, and this has caused widespread protests as many fear their loved ones will be among the victims: spontaneous marches and picket lines can be already seen in large cities, but the harshest backlash has come from the drafted themselves.\n\nRather than showing what [USA.GetLeader] has called "proud American spirit", thousands of college students and other young men have filled the streets, openly burning their draft cards and loudly protesting against an administration that, in their opinion, has "destroyed their dreams and replaced them with war". Of course, the opposition has immediately offered support to the protesters, promising their potential voters that their first concern will be the end of this "illiberal and useless measure", which they claim "receives the backing of profiteers and kleptocrats".\n\nSlowly, painfully, the police is restoring control, and the draft has resumed when it became clear that all those who refused to present themselves to the barracks will spend enough time in prison to completely forget about college. Still, it has appeared clear that the escalation of the war is seen with hostility and dissatisfaction by the general population of America, something which should drive the President towards a quick and victorious conclusion of this bloody conflict."

USA.oilcrisis.21.t:0 "Sending off Schwarzkopf"
USA.oilcrisis.21.desc:0 "Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf is one of the best minds we have when it comes to modern warfare. He's studied the examples of our allies and enemies alike, across four continents, and he's published a number of impressive internal memos about the present situation in the Middle East. Someone like him would be invaluable on the ground during the present crisis, especially to help train and guide the freedom fighters of the Arab world. However, we're in a bit of a bind. There are a number of high-priority conflicts currently raging in the Middle East, and only one Colonel Schwarzkopf. Some in the Pentagon have proposed that he lead a small mission to the Baathist fighters in Egypt, to aid in their struggle against the Saudi-backed theocrats and Italian Empire alike. Having a friend near the Suez Canal wouldn't be a bad idea. At the same time, his efforts could also bear fruit in Syria's current independence struggle, especially with the country's oil fields and strategic location. So, where should we send Colonel Schwarzkopf?"
USA.oilcrisis.21.a:0 "Let's send some soldiers to Syria."

USA.oilcrisis.22.desc:0 "An unmarked Learjet aircraft, flown by Air Force pilots in civilian clothes. Its itinerary: Hanscom Air Force Base to Keflavik. Keflavik to Stockholm. And after a long, seatrest-gripping flight over warzones and the anti-aircraft guns of a dozen factions, Stockholm to Hama.\n\nHama was a beautiful, ancient city, tightly clustered along the Orontes River. Minarets and clock towers pierced the skyline, gardens bloomed among its marble ruins, and giant metal water wheels still turned with the river's flow. But Hama was also at war. Flying in low over the Ghab Plain, the pilots could see all the signs. Gun emplacements, burned farms, bombed-out villages who'd had the rotten luck to meet the Turkish Army on a bad day. Or maybe it had been the Baathists who'd done that. "Doesn't matter either way," thought the copilot. He'd seen the same stuff in Namibia.\n\nFinally, the plane touched down at Hama Airbase. The airstrip was little more than packed dirt, and one of the three steel hangars had been demolished by artillery. Out on the "tarmac", the general was waiting. Mohammed Ziad al-Hariri was stout, with a receding hairline and an easy smile. He deployed it as Colonel Schwarzkopf stepped out of the plane. Their respective translators sidled up.\n\n"They call you the New Lafayette, Colonel."\n\n"Technically, I suppose that I would be the New von Steuben."\n\n"Regardless, a free nation thanks you. Welcome to Syria, Colonel Schwarzkopf.""
USA.oilcrisis.22.a:0 ""Liberty will never more be without an asylum.""
USA.oilcrisis.23.t:0 "An Arrival in Beni Suef"
USA.oilcrisis.23.desc:0 "Few people outside of Egypt had ever heard of Beni Suef. The vast streams of capital that had been flooding into Cairo and the Canal, propelled by foreign investment and railroad development, had left it behind. There had been a small Italian garrison-currently smeared across a back alley, courtesy of Baathist bullets-and a train station that most trains never bothered to stop at. It wasn't a true backwater, and to villagers throughout the governorate, it was still "el-madina", but most residents could feel the malaise in the air.\n\nNobody aboard the unmarked Learjet, cutting through the chilly night, knew about this. As it touched down on the makeshift airstrip, set up on the other side of the Nile from Beni Suef, a cadre of Baathist officers stood at attention. A small group of American soldiers hustled down the airstair, followed by the man of the hour. Deep-set eyes, a vast American chin, and a colonel's eagle on his uniform. Norman Schwarzkopf looked back at the plane that had brought him to Egypt, and then to the Egyptian officers.\n\n"Salaam aleikum.""

USA_a_new_republic_desc:0 "The Middle East has found itself plunged into crisis and disorder. On the one hand, Saudi Arabia is attempting to push its influence with guns and cash for radical Islamists. On the other hand, the Italian Empire seeks to hold onto its power in the region, for its imperial prestige and ENI profits. But, at the same time, both have found themselves struggling against the nascent forces of Arab republicanism. From Yemen to Syria to Egypt, army officers and ideologues alike are taking up arms in defense of national sovereignty, and against the despots of the past. We should throw our support behind these brave souls, and ensure that the Middle East is independent and free for all.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, victory will bring with it access to the world's greatest reserves of oil."
USA_There_Will_Be_Blood_desc:0 "Collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might present itself as a lucrative option, but it is one with the potential for unknown blowback and unforeseen consequences. Instead, we should exercise our own influence in the Middle East, disrupting the Italians and standing against the Saudis. To do this, we should support the rebels that, across the Arab world, have taken up arms in the name of freedom. It is vital that we support them against the tide of Saudi and Italian bullets. Yes, the outcome may be violent, but the established hegemons in the Middle East will be beaten by our proxies and cowed by our resolve. Such an effort would be well worth it."
USA_Make_Ready_For_War_desc:0 "Diplomatic communiques alone won't help our allies in the Middle East. If we're going to help liberate the nations of the Arab world, we'll have to send some firepower their way. We can send out new, discreet contracts to our top arms suppliers-Colt, Lockheed, Remington-and let them know that there will be more work on the way. These new arms shipments won't be anything fancy, but they will demonstrate our commitment to our Arab allies, while also giving American manufacturing a needed boost. Everybody wins!"
USA_A_New_Lafayette_desc:0 "The conflicts of the past several decades have produced a new crop of skilled officers and theoreticians. One of the most well-known of these, especially among the ranks of the Army, is Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. Colonel Schwarzkopf is a student of guerrilla tactics and resistance movements, and is well-positioned to help the nascent rebellions that have sprung up across the Middle East. He's one of our top men, and sending him into the field would undoubtedly boost our allies' efforts significantly. Nearly two centuries ago, a young Frenchman named Gilbert du Motier sailed to America, to help liberate our young nation. Colonel Schwarzkopf, one might say, is our answer to his legacy."
USA_Assess_Their_Politics_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second. Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open. Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations. For the most part, this is acceptable. There is a war to be won, after all, and not all niceties can be preserved. At the same time, though, we are the Organization of FREE Nations. Moreover, our arms shipments and diplomatic cover are in large part responsible for the survival of these forces. We can certainly stand to assess the internal politics of our allies, and try and push them towards a more pluralistic form of government. Why else are we here, if not to push freedom's power ever further?"
USA_Just_Like_Nambia_desc:0 "The South African War was fought on many fronts, from the marshes of the Limpopo to the mountains of the Manica, but one of the most infamous was certainly the deserts of southerwestern Africa. Amid the sands of the Namib, the Moçâmedes, and the Kalahari, American officers learned many lessons about desert warfare. Now, with our new intervention in the Middle East, we have the opportunity to put those lessons to good use. New "advisor" units, veterans of South Africa all, can integrate near-seamlessly into the forces of our Middle Eastern allies. With the knowledge of battles past, we can reap new victories in the fights to come."
USA_Spread_The_Cash_desc:0 "Money is a very effective tool. It can garner influence, fame, and resources, almost without limit. And, fortunately, the United States has plenty of money to move around. Our extensive discretionary cash reserves can be used to purchase loyalties across the Middle East, along with the services of armed contractors from further afield. In the grand scheme of things, it's fairly cheap, with the potential for major benefits. The efforts of these soldiers of fortune could go a long way towards achieving victory for our allies."
USA_Merchants_of_Death_desc:0 "Diplomatic support is a welcome boost for our allies. Money, advisors, and even foreign mercenaries are even more welcome. But at the end of the day, wars are won with firepower, and while our hands are officially tied by the bonds of congressional oversight, the CIA has a wealth of experience with ensuring that guns get where they're needed. Embargo, emshmargo. Our allies will get all the weaponry and ammunition they need, and both the Arabs and our own geopolitical position will benefit. And if some of those guns help to secure oil fields, well, so much the better."
USA_Across_The_Burning_Sands_desc:0 "America's presence in the Middle East has certainly ramped up over the past several months, but by comparison to the Italians and Saudis, it's still fairly paltry. That must change. We must send new, large-scale contingents of "military advisors" to support our allies in their fights against fascism and Islamism. On the ground, our firepower, tactics, and good old-fashioned American tenacity will surely demolish the enemy proxies. Our intervention will be felt from Riyadh to Rome, and beyond. There is a strong will for democracy in the Arab world, and America will ensure its security, by any means necessary."
USA_Smother_the_Flames_desc:0 "Collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might present itself as a lucrative option, but it is one with the potential for unknown blowback and unforeseen consequences. Instead, we should exercise our own influence in the Middle East, disrupting the Italians and standing against the Saudis. To do this, we should work on winning hearts, minds, and wallets across the region. Independence movements will be supported, victimized populations will be assisted, and new, strong, and free nations will be supported in the Arab world. Their prosperity, and their stability, will be our gain."
USA_Stabilize_the_Situation_desc:0 "Our allies in the Arab world need all the help that we can provide. That much is certain. However, the niceties of congressional oversight and the proclivities of public opinion make any offer of direct military aid all but impossible. That doesn't mean that we can't assist them, though. Shipments of non-lethal equipment such as binoculars, camouflage, vehicles, and body armor should be one of our top priorities. In addition, food and medical supplies can benefit both our allies' forces on the ground AND the civilians who have been put in harm's way by the fighting. Such efforts will communicate our commitments in the Middle East, while also earning some positive news coverage. After all, we're sending them butter, not guns. Who could have a problem with that?"
USA_Operation_Desert_Shield_desc:0 "Throughout the bloody wars that have torn the Middle East apart, one constant has been the use of air power by outside powers, seeking to bolster their proxies in the Arab world. Such air power has given them an advantage, but it's also had disastrous consequences for civilians on the ground. No longer. Using aircraft carriers stationed in the Indian Ocean, we can declare a series of no-fly zones over conflict areas. It will certainly be a slap in the face to powers like Italy, who have enjoyed years of uninterrupted hegemony in Arab skies, but countless lives will be saved, and American prestige will surely be bolstered."
USA_Help_The_Refugees_desc:0 "From Syria to Yemen to Egypt, and beyond, tens of thousands of civilians have been forced from their homes. Whether it's from the countryside to cities, from province to province, or from country to country, there are massive populations of displaced innocents who are in desperate need of assistance. The United States is in an excellent position to provide that assistance. Our freighters and transport planes can be tasked to send civilian medical teams, food aid, and even creature comforts to the refugee camps that are springing up across the region. It's the right thing to do, and more importantly, it will produce a tsunami of positive PR for our involvement in the Middle East."
USA_Guns_For_Democracy_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second. Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open. Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations. We can do better. Our unique position, as their primary source of supplies and diplomatic backing, gives us a great deal of leverage. We can hold the carrot of renewed aid, in return for liberalization of governance and accountability for abuses by military forces. It wouldn't need to be substantial, as long as it was public. If not, there's always the threat of being left out in the cold. That would be the stick."
USA_The_Desert_Scouts_desc:0 "The violence that the people of the Arab world have been facing as of late is intolerable. While our air interdiction efforts and humanitarian aid have certainly born fruit, we need to work further to stabilize the Middle East. One new proposal is to use American helicopters as a way to patrol far inland, when regular airpower would be imprecise or insufficient. Helicopters are generally much more versatile, and can be used to transport everything from medicine to information to tactical units. Such a "desert scout" program would initially consist mainly of American "blue suits", but with a bit of time, we can train our allies to fly as well. These patrols would undoubtedly yield excellent results on the ground."
USA_The_Hand_of_Kindness_desc:0 "War is hell, and war is destructive. While many states in the Middle East had already been struggling with developing modern infrastructure commensurate to their roles in the global economy, these recent wars have only made the issue worse. This is an issue that we can address. American investment, materiel, and engineering expertise can pave new highways, build new bridges, and upgrade rail lines in territories controlled by our allies. This will improve our ties, but in a region gripped by war, such programs would also provide a measure of stability."
USA_Sending_Them_Experts_desc:0 "Another one of war's casualties, too often, is knowledge. The Middle East has experienced a continual brain drain over the past several decades, as fascist colonialism and destabilizing wars have ruined the academic talent pools of the Arab world. By offering new scholarships to students from allied nations, and investing in research institutions, we can help ensure that the lands which gave us the House of Wisdom retain their intellectual strength. To secure the future, we must teach the present."
USA_A_More_Direct_Approach_desc:0 "At the end of the day, America is involved in the Middle East. Our officers help train forces in Egypt, our cargo planes supply refugees in Syria, and our cruise missiles protect the cities and towns of Yemen. We cannot ignore it, and as these wars against fascism and Wahabism continue to exact a bloody toll on the Arab world, it is clear that placing some boots on the ground is necessary. It will likely result in some protest at home, in the papers and in the streets of Washington, but America's regional interests are on the line, and American prestige must be preserved.\n\nJust so long as we can devise an exit strategy."

The American people have elected President [Root.GetLeader] in large part to bring them home posthaste.\n\nCongress has split into two sides over when to pull our boys out of the Veld. The "Interventionists", led by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, argue that bringing more of them for large-scale offensives will finally break the Schild's back and end the war soon. Chairman of House Foreign Relations Donald Rumsfeld and his "Technocrats" advocate leaving only our best behind with better leadership, doctrines, weapons systems and intelligence instead of risking a gruesome war of attrition.\n\nWhoseever advise the President listens to shall become America's strategy going forward.

Thus, the Pentagon has proposed the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support Program, aka CORDS. By assigning training personnel and funding to local communities, we can build up local security forces. This will give us additional cachet on the ground, and additional manpower to help combat a variety of insurgents. Civilians that feel secure and in control of their local environments will be better allies, and CORDS can help to make that happen."

Their weapons of trade can be put to better use paralyzing the Nazis' industries and supply lines instead of bogging ours to near-uselessness.

If it had a name, the report had an exact number and unit on mention.\n\nMcNamara didn't just put numbers into Nixon's war; he had turned death into variables a man can add and subtract, multiply and divide. As expected of Ford's brightest Whiz Kid, in hindsight. Perhaps he viewed the conflict as a car plant with faults to solve, and the men involved no different from spare parts on a manager's requisition list. That would at least explain the data charts taking up near-half this mammoth of a document. But did the President himself?\n\nFrowning, he turned towards the Secretary.

It is manned by a crew of six, can travel 6,400 nautical miles without refueling, and has a flight ceiling of 45,000 feet - several thousands higher than than the Me 262. Recent modifications to its bomb bay have allowed for a maximum payload of either four Mark 39 thermonuclear bombs or 60,000 lbs of conventional bombs such as the Mk-82 and -84.\n\n"At current, Eighth Air Force has around 170 units split between three air wings based in Minot and Barksdale AFB.

We sent the advisors, we sent our troops, we fought the Boers directly. However, the time has come for us to pull our troops from the continent and let the South Africans lead instead. The problem is, the South African military is in dire need of improvement, and in its current state, it will be wiped out by the advancing Germans. We will have to invest a lot of resources in giving the troops proper training, but at least our folks back home will be happy to see our involvement come to an end."

 USA_npp_saf_train_their_men_desc:0 "Right now, the South African military on its own would certainly get crushed by the elite German soldiers heading their way.

 USA_npp_saf_defending_the_cities_desc:0 "South Africa has been plagued by SS Werewolves and German-backed partisans since war broke out, but their influence has yet to reach the cities. It's realistically the only safe place while the countryside is burning. It is imperative that we fortify South African cities before the swift Sudwest bombers and rugged Ostafrikan infantry can inflict damage. If they demolish these cities to rubble, the weak Republic will have nothing left to stand on."

They won't be able to get the job done in their current state. That's why we need to let some of our toughest commanders show them how it's done, how to win against the Hun. We need to whip these commanders into shape so that they can lead their boys effectively into battle, so that they have a chance at stopping the Germans."

 USA_npp_saf_party_way_desc:0 "General Curtis LeMay is one of the most beloved military thinkers on the Far Right of the NPP, and with good reason. His attitude is that victory in South Africa can only be achieved by giving the military the authority to "bomb the Nazis back to the Stone Age". Going all-out would be enormously destructive for places that we are ostensibly supposed to save, but if it ends the war, it will be worth it in the end."

The Nazis have had more of a home field advantage, due to their close location, while all of our troops and supplies have to be sailed or flown in. One of our new initiatives in the South African War should be to expand existing port infrastructure in-country, and to create new facilities.

 USA_npp_saf_more_men_desc:0 "The most difficult truth of the South African War is that we need more boots on the ground. Air power is devastating, but the war will only be truly won when we can take and hold territory, and you can't do that with B-52s. We need to authorize a troop surge and flood South Africa with new forces. It won't be popular, and nobody truly wants to do this, but it's necessary.

Most of the rural hinterlands of Africa are dominated by jungles, swamps, and vast plains, and have become nightmares for our commanders on the ground. With our new airpower, though, we can use defoliants and napalm to eliminate all of these potential guerrilla hiding places. It will also have the convenient effect of forcing rural peasants into strategic hamlets and urban areas, denying the enemy a civilian population to hide within. Africa will rise stronger from this war, but first, the Nazis must become ash under our feet.."

There's yelling, a rush to the helicopter, the screams of the wounded.\n\nOn CBS, yet another campus building is occupied by protesters. Draft cards flicker like votive candles in the early evening light, as the nation's rebellious youth struggle under the pressures of the present age.\n\nOn NBC, a roundtable of intellectuals and politicians argue over what this war means for America, and for the world. They do this night after night, appealing to expertise when all else seems to be slipping away.\n\nIn Washington, watching the death and pain and anger from the relative comfort of his office's chair, the President puts his head in his hands.

Tens of thousands of Americans risked their lives every day in a war that seemed unwinnable on the ground, and pointless at home."\n\nHe knew that every eye was on him, and that every paper would carry his words.

It is a struggle which must end, not in ignominy, but in a victory for liberty and freedom for all.\n\n"At the same time, it is a struggle that we must recommit to. This is not an easy decision for me, and it is not an easy task for the country. But as a nation, we have always fought for freedom.

At a hospital, he pinned Purple Hearts on the wounded and paid tribute to the dead. Bearing witness to the results of this vast charnel house of a conflict.\n\nAs the sun set over Cape Town, he stood in front of a crowd of thousands of uniformed men and women. The speech was meant to pump them up. Restore confidence that their nation was behind them.

While Japan seems to be controlled by level-headed men, we must still be careful to toe the fine line between isolationism and being mavericks.\n\nWe will place a call to the Japanese on the red telephone. We will assure them that we have no interest in sending Japanese boys home with American bullets in them. Yet, our commitment to democratic movements around the world brings upon us a moral obligation to support those who fight for freedom in Indonesia. Reminding them of Indonesia's technical independence and sovereignty, we will caution them against launching an intervention into the East Indies and remind them that threatening the freedom of a sovereign people may have dire consequences."
 USA_RD_pick_up_red_phone_effect:0 "§OBy taking this focus, America will begin its involvement in Indonesia, and will face consequences depending on how this conflict will end§!\n"
 USA_RD_work_the_backchannels_desc:0 "Open armament of Free Indonesia may be a bridge too far for the moment. Nonetheless, equipment has often found its way into the stockpiles of rebel movements throughout the world. If American equipment were to find itself in Hatta's hands, well, that would surely be just a coincidence...\n\nWe shall open back-channels of communication and transport between Hatta and the United States. We shall ensure Hatta gets his hands on some premium American equipment. Hopefully, this will help turn the tide in the Indonesian war."
 USA_RD_secure_supply_lines_desc:0 "Every army travels on its stomach, and Hatta's is no different. His men need food, his trucks need fuel, and his guns need cartridges. America will gladly provide all of these.\n\nWe will use our positions in the Pacific, particularly Australia, to secure supply lines to the liberated zones of Indonesia. With our help, Hatta's men will want for nothing. We can only hope Japan is less generous to Sukarno than we are to Hatta."
 USA_RD_south_africa_lessons_desc:0 "The conflict in South Africa taught us much about asymmetrical warfare in the late 20th century. Our troops are battle-hardened, and our attaches may have useful insights to offer Hatta's freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send US Army Rangers to teach the Free Indonesians entrenchment tactics to improve their defensive capabilities against Sukarno. We will also teach them logistical techniques that will improve their mobility and ability to stay organized while on the march."
 USA_RD_send_advisers_desc:0 "The war has dragged on longer than we hoped, and we have no choice now but to escalate. Where once, we merely assisted Hatta's army, now it's time to fight alongside them.\n\nWe will send a full division of US troops to Indonesia in an "advisory" role. While these will merely be volunteers, they will be fighting in the thick of it defending the Indonesians on their left and right. This move will allow us to take a more direct role in the Indonesian war effort."
 USA_RD_hidden_hand_desc:0 "Our "advisors" have been making excellent progress in the Indonesian war effort, yet Sukarno's henchmen have proven rather intractable. Perhaps it is time to use our new forward base and naval routes to enlarge our commitment in Indonesia.\n\nAnother division of "advisors" will be deployed to aid Hatta. This will still be done under the guise of volunteer assistance of the Free Indonesian administration, that our "hidden hand" in the conflict may continue to be obscured."
 USA_RD_war_of_words_desc:0 "As the Indonesian conflict unfolds, it is critical that we control the conversation surrounding it. While the American everyman might not have much of a reason to care about Indonesia, by framing the situation as a struggle against our Japanese enemy, we might win their hearts and minds.\n\nWe will hit the airwaves and ensure that the world and our own people both know the righteousness of Hatta's cause. This will induce our people at home to sympathize with the Indonesian struggle for freedom, as well as assure the Free Indonesians that we have their back."
 USA_RD_united_we_stand_desc:0 "The Indonesian War is not a vanity project for the US alone, but a cause the whole OFN can get behind. We can't shoulder the burden of aiding Hatta alone, it's time for the OFN to contribute to the liberation of Indonesia.\n\nWe will call in support from the OFN. Not volunteers, that's a bridge too far, but we will secure substantial equipment donations from our member states. Hatta's men will be armed with weapons from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. This will hopefully greatly aid their independence struggle."
 USA_RD_expand_the_fleet_desc:0 "In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay and forced the Japanese to end centuries of isolation from the world. He accomplished this by having a massive armada of the finest warships sailing behind him. Naval intimidation of the Japanese worked once, we pray it shall work again.\n\nWe will start insisting on double shifts at our dockyards. Fleet production will ramp up considerably so that our ships may be commissioned more quickly. Hopefully, we'll be able to spook the Japanese with our resurgent Navy."
 USA_RD_force_their_hand_desc:0 "The Japanese control the Indonesian skies. Sukarno's men fly above and rain hell on Hatta's men below. The Sphere's aerial dominance is unquestioned.\n\nPerhaps it's time to question it.\n\nWe will send fighter jets and CAS equipment to Hatta. He will now be able to boast a powerful air squadron to challenge Japanese air superiority. Of course, this may tip Japan over the edge..."
 USA_RD_arms_production_desc:0 "The Indonesian conflict is more demanding than we realized. Our existing military factory output is insufficient to meet the needs of Hatta's men, as Sukarno has dug in more deeply than we expected.\n\nBut that's easy to solve.\n\nWe will send over engineers to Free Indonesia to construct a major military production complex as swiftly as possible. This will be a small boost to the Free Indonesian arms output, but hopefully enough to turn the tide against Sukarno. "
 USA_RD_forward_base_darwin_desc:0 "Australia is our closest ally to the Indonesians. The Northern tip of the country has one quite populous city, Darwin. This area could serve as an important launch point for any actions taken in the South Pacific.\n\nWe will offer to construct vast fortification networks in Northern Australia in order to brace for the conflict coming to their shores. These bases will also be excellent points from which to deploy troops to Indonesia."
 USA_RD_emergency_naval_training_desc:0 "I don't know if you've ever looked at a map, but there is no land route from the United States to Indonesia. Consequently, the Navy will be essential for any operations to assist Hatta, and it is all too important that the Navy be ready to carry them out.\n\nWe will launch emergency naval exercises to prepare our seamen for Indonesian operations. This may allow us to better update our naval warfare doctrines should we come into any conflict on the open seas. Hopefully the Japanese aren't foolish enough to let things get to that point, but we must nevertheless be prepared."
 USA_RD_ready_the_airforce_desc:0 "Our airmen are eager to deploy into Indonesia, but they need a base to deploy from first. Darwin has already been fortified for defense, but now it must be equipped for aerial operations.\n\nWe will send engineers to Australia to hastily construct air bases that are large enough for sizable air deployments. Their proximity to Indonesia shall allow us to aid Hatta's men from above, and deploy more squadrons than ever before."

 USA_NPP_ready_the_australians_desc:0 "Nixon, coward that he was, envisioned a policy of "containment" of Japanese imperialism. He would have used Australia as a forward operating base for US troops to provide an assistance role to Hatta. But we in the NPP know that the Organization of Free Nations ain't free. The Aussies ain't here to be a mere base of operations, they're going into the breach by our side.\n\nWe will put a call to the Aussies and tell them to ready their men for intervention in Indonesia. We'll get them fired up and ready to run through the jungle. We'll also send them some equipment too, in case they need it."
 USA_NPP_mandatory_naval_training_desc:0 "The purpose of the US Navy isn't just to move troops from point A to point B. It's not just a series of carriers for our planes. No, the Navy is a powerful tool in our diplomatic arsenal. It's the cannon that will fire the Marine Corps at Sukarno and keep the Japanese at arm's length.\n\nWe will conduct emergency Naval exercises to prepare the USN to starve Sukarno.

USA_RD_INS.01.d:0 "The East Indies have exploded into civil war as the rivalry between President Sukarno of Indonesia and his opposition, led by Vice President Mohammad Hatta, have finally come to blows. Forces across the archipelago are mobilizing and taking sides, as various army regiments and resistance groups flock to the rebels. Already, protestors in major cities, having been broken up through force of arms, are retreating into the jungles to settle in for the long war.\n\nWhile some may be surprised to see the once-beloved Sukarno the target of a civil war, most expert observers have been anticipating such a conflict for years. Sukarno's increasingly dictatorial sway over Indonesia has soured opinion, both in the government and among the people, to the point where his own Vice President had become the greatest voice against him.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Japanese have declared support for their ally in the dictatorial Sukarno, but Free Indonesia is not without potential allies. Despite consisting mainly of hardline communists and Islamists, the rebellion has attracted much support in America from the anti-Japanese National Progressive Party. With such a vital part of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in flames, the United States stands in a unique position to weaken the Japanese stranglehold over Asia-- something that many Americans have been demanding for decades."

He shuffled around his speech notes as the audience eagerly awaited his words on the Indonesian conflict. This was the opportunity; the first chance America had to break the Japanese stranglehold over Asia. He had better make it count.\n\n"Fellow Americans... over the course of the past several weeks, a conflict of a momentous nature has erupted in the reaches of Southeast Asia-- in the island nation of Indonesia. There, as we speak, thousands of men and women are dying for a most righteous cause: the destruction of tyranny. A dictatorial shadow has encompassed that land, and now, an army of freedom-loving peoples are fighting to burn that shadow away."\n\n"...the cause of the Indonesian freedom fighters is one that America shall always support. As our forefathers fought in the valley of Pennsylvania, so too do their heroes fight in the jungles of Java and of Borneo. These men and women, engaged in such a righteous struggle, must not be allowed to fail. However, with the freedom-loving people of America standing behind them, they shall not. Indonesia shall be a free and democratic nation as God has ordained it to be. Together, the peoples of Indonesia and America shall see that tyranny is extinguished from this Earth!""

Sukarno's attempt at using martial law to solve the crisis with the PKI has been a dismal failure; after years of frustration with his despotic administration, liberal democrat Mohammad Hatta has risen up against Sukarno under the banner of "Free Indonesia."\n\nWhile Sukarno may stress that everything is under control, Hatta is moving swiftly to seize the country, having already taken large swaths of Aceh, Borneo, and Papua. This could be a critical opportunity for the United States to gain a new ally against Japanese domination of Asia, as long as we act quickly."

With Sukarno ousted, the popular front of Free Indonesia has taken power. Comprised of anti-Sukarno republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, this ragtag army proved too strong for the loyalist forces. Already, a democratic government is being set up in Jakarta with much of the former rebel leaders taking up leadership positions.\n\nWith the victory of Free Indonesia, the administration of [USA.GetLeader] has seen a notable increase in popular approval. Having promised the defeat of Sukarno and the triumph of democracy, the President's promise appears to have become reality. Exactly to what degree the United States' support affected the Indonesian Civil War remains a matter of debate, but for now, America seems happy to see a favorable conclusion to the war."

From the balcony of a Jakarta government building, Sukarno delivered a speech, declaring the civil war to be finally over. The opposition forces, comprised of republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, are now surrendering to the government in Jakarta en masse. Already, many of the leaders of the rebellion are being rounded up and then executed or sent to prison.\n\nWith the victory of Sukarno, and his autocratic grip over Indonesia tightened, the American public has become angered and distraught. After so many defeats over the past 20 years, it is still disheartening to see another flicker of liberty be extinguished. Most upset are those in the National Progressive Party, who blame Japanese intervention and a limp-wristed American response for the defeat of Free Indonesia. With another American boondoggle in Southeast Asia, it appears the political establishment in Washington may be harder pressed to keep their jobs in the next election."

USA_NPP_INS.01.d:0 "Anger among the National Progressive Party has come to a head this week with the official end of the Indonesian Civil War. Throughout the course of the war, many among the party had organized protests over American neutrality in the conflict, claiming that if the United States had involved itself, it would have been over much quicker and with far less bloodshed. Now, with the war over, any chance for the administration of [GetLeader] to redeem itself on this issue has passed.\n\nDespite claiming that the United States would support the cause of Free Indonesia against the Japanese-backed Sukarno government, President [USA.GetLeader] appears to have fallen through on his promise. No American support ever reached the anti-Sukarno forces in Indonesia, and many have claimed that the President simply allowed the Japanese to reassert their control over the archipelago. Leaders in the National Progressive Party are now calling the President weak, and demanding that a more anti-Japan stance be taken."

USA_RD_INS.11.t:0 "Minor Protests in Washington"
USA_RD_INS.11.d:0 "There was a small protest along the National Mall today of less than 500 people against the recent deployment of American troops to Indonesia. The archipelago erupted into civil war this year, and the United States has officially intervened on the side of the forces fighting against the regime of President Sukarno. So far, the war has gone relatively well for the United States Marine Corps and Army forces who have been deployed there. There have been no major defeats, and generally, allied forces have been winning more and more victories.\n\nThe protest, largely led by students from Georgetown University and American University, focused on pacifism and the predicted loss of American lives overseas. The march was widely panned, particularly by Senator Strom Thurmond as "a bunch of youngsters who have no idea what they're talking about". Despite the political criticism, experts agree that sentiments expressed in the march are not exclusive to young college students, and that small-scale opposition to the Indonesian War may be seen across the country in coming months."

USA_RD_INS.12.t:0 "A Bad Day in Berkeley"
USA_RD_INS.12.d:0 "Today, at the University of California, Berkeley, a protest against the Indonesian War turned violent as clashes between National Guard and police forces monitoring the march and the demonstrators themselves. One Berkeley student, whose name is unknown at this time, apparently threw a brick at a National Guardsman in full riot-gear. The brick missed, but still had an impact, as the National Guard raised their weapons and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the mass of students and protestors.\n\nBy the time the protest had been dispersed, more than 20 people had been hospitalized for injuries. Most unfortunately, however, was the case of student James Rector, who was shot with live ammunition by police and killed during the fighting. The violence has had a widely polarizing effect on the United States as a whole, with many calling the protestors thugs, and others calling them heroes. It also highlights the increasing unpopularity of the war in Indonesia and America's involvement in it."

USA_RD_INS.13.t:0 "Burning Pacifism"
USA_RD_INS.13.d:0 "Today, outside the gates of the White House, a pacifist quaker named Norman Morrison doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire. The man appears to not have screamed almost at all, despite the extreme pain, which suggested to investigators some kind of pain killing drug use. After all that remained was a charred corpse, however, the man's child, Emily, was found, with a note describing his reasons for suicide. He wrote that he had done this in protest to President [USA.GetLeader]'s involvement in the Indonesian Civil War, and that he set himself on fire in solidarity with the Indonesian and American boys who didn't choose a death by fire.\n\nThe public and political reaction can be described as nothing short of horrified. Thousands of people are now planning to "March for Morrison" and spread the ideas that he killed himself for. The President has yet to comment on the issue, but the White House is not letting in press at the moment.\n\nMorrison's death and the vast sympathy to it across the country appears to be part of a growing trend of Americans disliking the country's involvement in the Indonesian Civil War. While there is still a great number who call the anti-war demonstrators "traitors", more and more Americans say that the war is costing too much for too little. Whether or not the government will do anything remains to be seen, but if the anti-war movement has a dedication like Morrison's, it's unlikely that the government will have a choice."
USA_RD_INS.13.a:0 "Rest in peace."

USA_RD_INS.14.t:0 "America on Fire"
USA_RD_INS.14.d:0 "Over the past few days, many cities across the continental United States have erupted into violence following a massive series of organized and unorganized protests against the country. The demonstrations were meant to be against the widely-hated American intervention in the Indonesian Civil War, which has seen little returns for a great cost of lives. Reports claim that in many cities, violence was started by police told to disperse the protestors by any means necessary; in others, it appears protestors heard of violence in other cities and/or simply decided to start some themselves.\n\nThe violence is now beginning to calm down, and the cost appears to be astronomical. More than 50 Americans lay dead, all across the country, and hundreds or thousands have been hospitalized from wounds. It is evident from the sheer scale of the riots that the nation as a whole despises the war in Indonesia, and desires a complete end to the conflict."

President [GetPresidentLastName] surveyed the room, knowing the enormity of the moment was giving everybody pause. \n\n"It's been twenty years since the end of the war, gentlemen," President [GetPresidentLastName] said. "A decade or so since Eisenhower tore up the Akagi Accords and admitted Hawaii to the Union. Now it's our turn to finish what he started." \n\nThe proposal - to stand up to Japan at last and to demand negotiations over the Treaty Ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles - would be the most ambitious and consequential diplomatic initiative by the United States in their lifetimes. The eyes of the world, and of the American electorate, would be scrutinizing them under a microscope. There would be no room for failure. \n\nThe Japanese wouldn't simply fold - but it was clear that holding ports halfway across the world, a diplomatic nightmare and impossible to secure, was increasingly unattractive. \n\nHow much could America push, without being pushed aside by Japan in return? It would take the political power of the American government to ensure the successful return of the ports, without giving away the house to the Japanese in the process - but a few concessions here and there might be useful in making demands further down the line..."

Twenty years after the victory in the Pacific, the ports were rapidly becoming more trouble than they were worth as Japan faced new challenges from every corner. If Japan could walk away from the negotiations with tangible guarantees - open trade, oil provisions, or an enforceable promise to formally recognize Japan's suzerainty over the Sphere - then what were two ports, really? \n\nIt would take every ounce of political and diplomatic capital to keep any deal as favorable to Japan as possible, even if they gave way on certain items to gain a temporary advantage to be used later.

Simply put, the Sphere lacks many of the oil reserves that we have here in the United States. Luckily, the Japanese diplomats seem pretty desperate to sign a contract with us. If we grant them subsidized oil purchases, the economy of the Sphere will continue functioning and we may regain our lost ports. If we help out the Japanese and the Sphere helps us out, we could see a brighter relationship between our two great nations. We also have a chance of bringing American workers back to work for us.\n\nNow, the question of the moment is: how much oil will we give to the Empire of Japan? We could be generous and offer them the substantial amounts of oil they say they need. We could go down the middle and offer them a moderate amount of oil.

These last few days were supposed to mark the end of Japanese oppression on the West Coast. The handing-off of the treaty ports was meant to symbolize the American eagle's rebirth onto the world stage as a bringer of democracy, a beacon of hope against the evils of Fascism. These negotiations were not just for the goodness of the peoples of San Francisco and Los Angeles, no, the Americans were going to gain much-needed prestige from the deal with Japan.\n\nThe Japanese, on the other hand, were handling a massive oil shortage across the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Diplomats hated stooping so low as to ask the United States for economic assistance; the Empire had triumphed over the States two decades ago, and now they needed their help? Wasn't this the problem that caused World War II in the first place? But they were desperate. Desperate for a resource that would fix the economic problems of an entire region. The negotiations showed that apparently, Japan was not desperate enough.

No matter what, both parties hope that these negotiations will better relations between the two global superpowers. Workers both in California and the Japanese Home Islands rejoiced as the nations announced the completion of the deal.\n\nThough the trade deal was completed, the diplomats of the United States and Japan still have work to do.

This would ensure us the most important prize, market access, and allow us to quickly move on to other parts of the treaty.\n\nMany in our cabinets, however, believe that a mutual lift favors the Americans too much, and are pushing to attach trade conditions to the deal. These conditions would provide for mutual reduction of several tariffs in areas beneficial to Japan, ensuring us more favorable trade terms, but might not go down well with the Americans.\n\nThirdly, there are some who think we are offering a deal too cheaply, inviting further bullying attempts by the Americans in the future.

The specifics of the transfer has been left to the end of the negotiations, and this will be the last clause up for discussion. We have a few options for how we position ourselves to approach these final negotiations.\n\nOur advisors fear that a straightforward transfer will be perceived in Japan as a loss of face, and that the politics of that perception might jeopardize the negotiations. To avoid this, they say, we should offer to demilitarize the ports upon transfer. By doing so we will ensure the Japanese have something they can point to as "getting in return" - enabling them to transfer the ports without appearing weak.\n\nOthers in our administration counsel a tougher approach. The goal of the whole summit, they say, is to turn a page on our relations with Japan, and that can only be accomplished if they agree not only to the port transfer, but to demilitarize Hawaii. With the Hawaiian Missile Crisis in all too recent memory, they claim the asymmetry of mutual threat will soon cause a rise in tensions back to previous levels as long as the Japanese garrison the island chain. Our most hawkish counsel suggests we can demand the demilitarization of Hawaii without offering to demilitarize the ports in turn.

Most of our advisors consider this a favorable deal. It accomplishes our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA, while scoring us a victory in the form of demilitarization.\n\nSome, however, are saying that American willingness to accept such conditions betray the weakness of their position, and suggest we push to attach a second condition to the transfer - making the ports a special customs territory shared between our two nations.

We'd also open ourselves up to potential smuggling operations out of the zones. Accepting such a blatant power-grab would also encourage Japan to continue this "bad-faith" approach in future talks between our countries, according to these advisors.\n\nOn the other hand, this could be the final hurdle of the negotiations.

According to our advisors, however, it is far from balanced. The docks in Hawaii are vital for our operational capacity in the East Pacific. Losing them will force us to choose between reduced operational space, which will surely anger our admirals, or constructing new docks on different islands, which will be expensive. The Americans have already more than replaced the docking capacity they lost when we occupied the ports, and are in no great need of them for their navies.\n\nSome in our delegation point out that while this particular clause may be unbalanced, we risk losing our gains in the earlier clauses should we push the Americans too hard on this issue.

The Hawaiian Missile Crisis, they "remind" us, was caused by "American recalcitrance" and "our internal failures driving foreign policy decisions", and the onus is "entirely on the USA" to prevent a repeat of the event.\n\nMany in our administration point out that this arrogance is typical of the Japanese in their dealings with us. Discussions are completed on the clauses that matter to the Japanese, so they've reverted to their attitude of "victorious conquerors", dictating demands to a vanquished foe. If we accept their diktats, they say, we'll set up for them to continue their arrogant disregard for our interests in our future dealings as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the success of the summit hinges on us finding some way to accommodate both nations here, and we might need to give them this to prevent the negotiations from unraveling entirely.

Hawaii is also a significant strategic asset, and demilitarization would lose both our navy and air force an important base.\n\nOn the other hand, we risk losing the economic benefits we've worked so hard to secure ourselves in the first two clauses.

We never agreed to discuss the status of Hawaii and are under no obligation to. Some of our delegation are calling for us to punish the Americans for their brash behavior by attaching conditions, including demilitarization, to the ports instead.

This is the clause that is the most important to the Americans, and they might very well be willing to stake the entire accords on getting a favorable outcome here. What will we do?"

The ports, and Hawaii for that matter, are American soil and we can't allow a foreign power to keep making demands and setting conditions for how we act on our own territory. If the Japanese want better relations, they can damn well accept that we won't allow them to keep waving Hawaii-based navies and missiles at our faces. A demilitarized Hawaii means peace in the East Pacific, and peace in the East Pacific is the only outcome we will accept. We will resubmit our original proposal. We will insist on a demilitarized Hawaii."

For any deal to be signed, they say, it must mean the end of Japan dictating matters on US soil, and a demilitarization in California would stand in the way of that aim.\n\nTheir demands are outrageous, far exceeding the scope of what was agreed upon in the lead-up to the summit, and very few would fault us for declining. They want both the treaty ports and a demilitarized Hawaii and they're staking everything else at this summit to get both. Are we willing to do the same?"

Together, this provides us with an opportunity too good to pass up. With most of the treaty safely agreed upon, it's time to open discussion on one last question: The return of Hawaii.\n\nIn order to get them to even consider the transfer, we must be prepared to give important concessions in return. Our advisors believe they might ask for a joint or neutral administration of the Panama Canal, extensive arms limitation concessions, or both. Regardless, it might be a price we should be willing to pay. Securing Hawaii would be a fantastic achievement for our government and for the USA, but beyond that, it would cement this treaty as the end of the era of hostility between us and the Japanese.\n\nThe last core US territory still occupied by Japan, its return will mark a true end to the war in the minds of the public and help usher a time of peace in the East Pacific."

For the first short leg of its journey back to friendlier waters, each and every Japanese ship has been sneered farewell by jeers, threats and obscene gestures from a hostile city.\n\nToday, as the last Japanese cruiser finally left the port of San Francisco, this ritual was broken. The jubilant crowds, freshly arrived from "port parties" all over the city, waved and cheered our sailors a final goodbye. The Captain of Chikuma called for all hands on deck to witness the event, and soon our sailors were cheering and waving back. Pictures of the exchange are making the rounds on television on both sides of the Pacific, a sure sign to our people that an era of heightened hostility is coming to a close.\n\nNot everyone is equally enthused, of course. Many in our own country are grumbling about how much ground we are giving to the Americans. We can only hope that the economic benefits of the accords will change their minds as they start trickling out to the population.

All across the country, everyday life has given way to "port parties", pulling whole neighbourhoods out into the streets in celebration. The biggest crowds of all have been seen in the treaty port cities themselves. In San Francisco, cheers from the gathered throngs drowned out the voices of the Japanese ambassador and his translator as the last Japanese flag was taken down and the stars and stripes hoisted in its place.\n\nSurprise was evident among the Japanese as well, as the sailors aboard Chikuma found themselves cheered goodbye by the jubilant crowds, the scowls and jeers they had come to expect from Americans replaced by cheerful smiles and waves. Pictures of the uniformed Japanese smiling and waving back to the crowds are now making the rounds on television on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nTruly, it feels like a page has been turned on US-Japanese relations."

The visit's official intent was a tour around the American capital - a show of goodwill capitalizing on the momentum of the now-named Handover's success.\n\nUnofficially... well, the old man had his suspicions. He thought them confirmed when he entered the Oval Office and saw the President, back turned, inspecting a large canvas map of Hawai'i. The Minister drew in a sharp breath as he took a seat, steeling himself for the last conversation he ever wished to confront in his career.\n\n"I trust the accommodations here are to your liking?" President [GetPresidentLastName] asked without glancing back. The Foreign Minister grunted in assent. Not exactly proper decorum, but he figured the silence meant the President didn't care.\n\n"Good." Leather shoes clacked with polished linoleum as the President shuffled back to the Resolute Desk, pulling several folders out of its cabinet. [USA.GetSheHeCap] spread the stack across the surface like a dealer with a stack of cards. Each folder bore "PROPOSAL" in red capital letters across their tab. "Wouldn't want to keep you from seeing the sights, so I'll keep this brief: we've some ideas for your government's consideration. We'll discuss these more later during your stay."\n\nAs quickly as he had arrived, the Minister left the Office escorted by his assigned guide.

In exchange, they have agreed to enforce the same in the Panama Canal Zone. President [USA.GetLeader] expects a speedy response in official channels, and has voiced his willingness to attend another conference to negotiate the agreement's finer details at a time and place of our choosing.\n\n"I understand your concerns, sir. Convincing the public, no less the Navy, to return our farthest-flung awards from the Liberation War was already a momentous endeavor by itself. Another concession to our adversary may signal weakness our enemies in Tokyo will doubtless capitalize. Nevertheless, the American President has offered us an opportunity whose waste we can scarce afford: a guarantee of peace between our two nations at least within our lifetimes.

I managed to deflect the advances made as best as one could in my situation, though I can't say the same for the mob that trailed our entourage as we toured Washington D.C. The gold eagle lapel pins several sported made their collusion all too blatant.\n\n"If I may speak my mind for a brief moment: we underestimate the lengths the Americans will go to wrest the islands from us. Nevermind the Navy's tarnished pride, or the Diet's gnashing of teeth; both pale before the conflict our rival is willing to wage over Hawai'i.

Me and my aides-de-camp were invited, which we graciously accepted. What followed was a lengthy tour of the Panama Canal Zone - all of the engineering marvel's fifty miles of length and ten miles of width, and its facilities, traversed in less than a day. It was only when we dined at the Palacio de las Garcias that the President engaged my queries regarding our trip to an American military installation. The response I received went thus: "We can make it yours, but only if you can make one of yours ours again."\n\n"Frankly speaking, Mr. Prime Minister, we would be fools not to engage with the trade. Besides dog-headed sentimentality over their spoils from the Liberation War, the Navy's other rationale behind Port Yamamoto was that it consolidates our hold over the Pacific Ocean with its bases and strategic location. The Panama Canal offers those in addition to uncontested control over one of the world's busiest shipping routes, notwithstanding the estimated $70 million in revenue it generates every year.\n\n"I sincerely believe the Americans have offered us this exchange only because of the goodwill we've garnered from the Handover.

Both parties resolved to forbid all military assets from fortifying, basing or, in the case of planes, overflying the aforementioned territories. Both parties also consented to regular inspections by a bipartisan committee, ensuring the agreement's letter and spirit are enforced.\n\nWhere an otherwise ideal negotiation process met the realities of jockeying with a geopolitical adversary was when the frequency of such inspections was broached. Our diplomats, understandably, proposed that the committee convene in an annual basis. The Americans insisted that they convene once every two years instead, stating that sufficiently rigorous inspections for two distinct locations require more time to conduct and report than a year allots. The Japanese delegation's head responded by questioning the need for inspections lasting longer than a year. Their Western adversary's insistence was unperturbed by the dismissal.\n\nAfter several hours of debate (and several emptied bottles of hard liquor), the conference's attendants finally reached a consensus. Henceforth, a committee consisting of select officials and experts from both countries shall inspect Hawai'i and the Panama Canal Zone for breaches of terms..."

"Laws are toothless without punishments," said the Japanese Foreign Minister, "and only sharp teeth suffice for treaties between two nations that can end the world with a button press."\n\nOur ambassadors were split on the issue. On one hand, clearly defined punishments for violations within the proposed DMZs disincentivize Japan from using them as de facto outposts for their Pacific-wide cordon sanitaire - provided, of course, that the same penalties apply to them. Those disinclined to trust the Empire's intentions argued that the punishments will be selectively, and aggressively, applied at our disfavor. (Additionally, a minority opined, stringent punishments will prevent us from justifying certain activities through "creative interpretation" of the agreement's terms. Future administrations may find themselves an option short should the need for action in the DMZs arise.)\n\nIn the end, the American delegation..."

When asked to clarify by the cautious Americans, they proposed actions ranging from remilitarizing the affected territories to establishing a full embargo. Even talk of declaring the Handover null and void gained traction among its more zealous members - that is, until their arguments were cut short by the meaty thwack of a face meeting fist.\n\nOrder returned to the conference room before the negotiations broke down under an inter-Pacific exchange of blunt force trauma. The Americans, now made both cautious and disheveled, presented their own counteroffer: economic sanctions and immediate withdrawal from all economic, military, and diplomatic agreements signed following the Handover. These will be resumed, they further explain, only when the offending party ceases their violations of the agreement. Efforts to extract more from the delegation was met with the enthusiasm of a stony brick wall.\n\nAs a new day peeked from the window blinders, Japan's diplomats reached their ultimate consensus:"

Shredded and whole paper covered every square inch of floorboard, topped by stray mug shards slick with drying pools of coffee and the stray blood smear. Its occupants fared little better; either they were dozing off where they stood or sat or laid, wincing at cuts and bruises covered in flimsy gauze pads, or both. 24 straight hours of wheeling and dealing a treaty had taken its toll. No doubt the Japanese were eager to leave with what they had, at least then they'll enjoy sleeping in cushions and for more than a few hours in the flight home.\n\nCan he say the same for his - that they were satisfied with what they had? Will his countrymen approve what he'd wrangled from the Empire when all's said and done? Or will both dig their heels and ask for more?\n\nThe Secretary then turned to the man with the outstretched hand, opposite his side of the long table. Stodgy with a bald spot, purple bags for eyes, a rotund belly protruding from an unbuttoned suit. He might as well have been a middle-aged salaryman coming home from overtime, rather than the Empire's premier representative abroad.

The closest the Pacific ever has been to certain peace lay just beyond the Empire's fingertips, and will be theirs should it choose to reach out instead of reflexively withdrawing from an impermanent slight.

The United States will withdraw from the negotiations forthwith, Hawaii or no Hawaii."\n\n"We still got something out of them. Give me a week, maybe two, see if I can budge them a little."\n\n"They could've gotten something from us, but apparently they couldn't care less if they didn't." President [GetPresidentLastName]'s voice lowered to an almost-quiet, like one would when making polite requests. "You're not gonna spend any more time with the Japs than you already had. Understood?"\n\nStatic. Moments later, a sigh. "I'll deliver the news."\n\n"Be at my office tomorrow morning. And pay the bar a visit before you do; the drunken louts there will at least spit on your face upfront."\n\n[GetPresidentLastName]'s arm froze right before it could slam the handset against its hook."

#IRCW Tree Descriptions
USA_the_iranian_civil_war_desc:0 "War grips Iran, one of the few countries in the Muslim world with a strong tradition for democracy. If we are serious about our commitment to ensuring fascism is contained everywhere in the world, we must be as forceful and determined in our response to this civil war as we are in countries like South Africa and Indonesia. The US has always been and will always remain a steadfast ally of antifascists everywhere, and America has always been a true friend of Iran. We must look to organizing a response, we cannot let the fascists control the oil reserves there to fuel their evil empires."
USA_iranian_aid_bill_desc:0 "The House foreign policy committee has swiftly drawn up a bill authorizing dispatch of advisors, equipment and financial aid to Iran, as well as authorizing the government to advertise, organize and dispatch volunteer divisions from both veteran and active duty Army personnel. Once this goes through Congress, help will be on its way to the brave Iranians."
USA_american_aid_inbound_desc:0 "The Iranian Aid Act has been quickly rushed through Congress to ensure a timely response to the crisis there. An immediate loan of $100 million has been granted to the Iranian liberal faction so they can fund their armed forces until American equipment and volunteers can arrive en masse. Initial military advisors are to be dispatched as soon as secure flights can be established, followed by the equipment and then the volunteers. With some luck the Iranian liberal movement will soon be strong and economically stable, a force that can sweep aside the armies of tyranny opposing them."
USA_american_equipment_desc:0 "Coordinating with the Iranian liberals and our advisors, we have set up a pipeline for regular shipments of military equipment between California and Iran, using Australia as a go-between. Sadly, for the moments this limits our ability to send significant quantities for the gear, but the ability for the Iranians to use the remaining money from their loan to buy American weaponry and gear will certainly be a relief for both them and our domestic arms industry."
USA_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "The eagle soars once again to distant shores! Our advisor teams report the bulk of their teams have landed safely in Iran, and request we coordinate with the legitimate, freedom-loving Iranian government to ensure they have translators, staff and vehicles available."
USA_american_loans_desc:0 "The Iranians have run out of money from our initial loan to them! This simply won't do, they are fighting tooth and nail against the enemies of democracy and freedom. Let us pull some strings at the congressional budget office to authorize further Liberty Loans to the Iranian liberals. No amount of money is worth a loss to fascist tyranny."
USA_send_in_cia_advisors_desc:0 "While not mentioned in the official Iranian Aid Act, in the black budget we have set aside money for advisors from REDACTED to instruct and share REDACTED with the Iranian REDACTED services. It is our REDACTED 's hope that this will lead to REDACTED, increased trust, REDACTED, REDACTED, higher recruitment of Persian-speaking operatives, REDACTED, and new perspectives on the regional intelligence situation, especially in regards to REDACTED."
USA_grand_strategy_of_the_iran_war_desc:0 "With the Iranian Civil War still dragging on, our administration finds itself on a crossroads. Should we commit fully, South Africa-style, with boots on the ground and a strong hand, or should we press on with the current strategy of primarily arming the Iranian liberals and letting them fight the war for us? We will need to carefully weigh whether the risk of upsetting the public with another foreign conflict is worth the risk of losing Iran to the forces of tyranny. The economic and geopolitical consequences of the fascists controlling the oil of Iran could be devastating, but a direct intervention can seriously undermine our popularity, not to mention our military budget plans. What should we do?"
USA_promise_more_american_soldiers_desc:0 "We have to go all in on this one, public opinion be damned. We are readying several divisions of intervention troops to help the liberal Iranians win this thing, and have already sent them our assurances more are on their way. Democracy will never die where the torch of liberty shines bright through its soldiers! Forwards to freedom!"
USA_promise_more_american_equipment_desc:0 "We cannot risk another bloodbath like we faced in the jungles this decade. To limit the potential loss of American life without letting the Iranians down, we will instead announce an expansion of our current strategy, with efforts undertaken to greatly increase the quantity of weapons shipments to the Iranian liberals. This will be difficult, but we will be enjoying the cooperation and support of our military-industrial complex, which stands to benefit from the Liberty Loans being spent on their product line."
USA_to_free_the_oppressed_desc:0 "To help build popular support for our intervention in Iran, we have crafted a carefully staged media campaign showing our soldiers and the Iranian liberals working in tandem to bring freedom to the oppressed classes of Iran. Zoroastrians, Christians and women will all feature heavily in the messaging, with starry eyes thanking their American liberators. The coverage will even be mostly true for once, as we really fight on the side of the most tolerant and Western-aligned faction present."
USA_darwin_supply_hub_desc:0 "The biggest hurdle in supplying the Iranians has been that we've relied on Australian shipping for the last stretch of the journey. If we instead repurpose and expand our naval base at Darwin, intended for use in supplying allies and intervention forces in Indonesia, as well as defending Australasia proper, we can move the supplies the whole way on American keel, in larger and faster freighters. This should enable us to greatly expand the transported volume, albeit at a significant monetary cost."
USA_new_contracts_for_military_industral_complex_desc:0 "The promise of fresh contracts delivered the expected support from the large armaments firms. A group of them have promised that they will invest in any efforts we make to expand the supply pipeline to Iran, on the condition that it is structured in such a way as to give them a voice in the running of the products. In normal times this sort of collusion with private arms manufacturers might be seen as unethical, but the last twenty years have been anything but normal, and we have to be ready to work with all our allies to defeat fascism, whether they be countries or corporations. Let us begin the restructuring."
USA_the_beacon_of_hope_desc:0 "We have done everything we can for the Iranian liberals. As we ship off the last of our promised supplies and men, we can only hope that the sacrifices America has made to help the Iranian people rise the torch of liberty against the extremist tyrants surrounding the liberals on all sides. One day, Iran will be a true democracy and close ally of our great republic, but if the liberals can win here and now, we will have progressed tremendously in pushing back the darkness of our age. Let the flame of freedom we have lit in the Iranian people forever serve as a beacon of hope to the oppressed all around the Middle East and the World!"
