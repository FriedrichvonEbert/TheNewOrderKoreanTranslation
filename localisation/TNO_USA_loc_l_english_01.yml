 USA_OFN_Canada_desc:0 "캐나다는 정당한 영국의 통치자가 런던을 되찾을 수 있도록 준비를 하고 있지만, OFN에서 가장 헌신적인 국가이기도 합니다. 이처럼 그들은 독일군에 대항하는 아프리카 전쟁에서 우리에게 절실히 필요한 도움을 줘야 할 의무가 있습니다. 캐나다 동맹국을 불러야 하는데, 누가 알겠습니까, 우리가 그들에게 돈을 줄 수도 있겠죠."

 USA_OFN_kickstart_media_desc:0 "Times have changed, and in our new American society, the President does not have as much influence over his people as he would like.

 USA_OFN_boer_atrocities_desc:0 "Overall, it seems like the American public is still adamant in their pacifist beliefs. Even if the war is only a regional conflict, our folks at home are not very happy about another war in foreign land. We have been picking up reports of German crimes being committed in South Africa; if we exaggerate these tales enough, we will be able to get the support we need. We must magnify German cruelty in order to ensure that all Americans strongly oppose the very enemies we are fighting."

We must act fast; the democracy is struggling to stand."

 USA_OFN_the_economy_desc:0 "Our military is weaker than it has been in a long time, and with the times changing and the relations between the great powers cooling off, we must use this war to power our military engine, once again.

 USA_OFN_a_necessary_war_desc:0 "This war must be fought! If we don't bring the war to the Nazi-fucks down in Africa, they will eventually bring the war to us on their terms, and we cannot have that happen. The war is necessary to secure the future of South Africa and keep the Eastern route to Asia safe. It is necessary because if we don't have safe ways to Asia, we sure as hell will lose future opportunities to increase our influences in Asia"

 USA_OFN_guards_iceland_desc: "Iceland has been as one large military base, this has lead to many young Icelandic males training with the army and some have been trained in supporting roles, radio operators, field nurses, and engineers.

Sound, tested models of administration and investment would unlock the economic potential of Africa! The Indian and South Atlantic Oceans would be secured for the free world!\n\nLike many foreign conquerors before them, they soon found their ambitions dashed. Their leadership found itself overwhelmed trying to make sense of the disparate tribes, factions and groupings and struggled just to maintain the status quo. Investments dried up as delays, red tape and petty corruption made a mockery of investment models and profit projections. Generals and politicians alike watched with horror as patrol after patrol failed to make it back to their bases.\n\nThe cumulative weight of all these setbacks have proven too much to bear for the Mandates and their masters, and they are now cutting their losses and leaving the territories."

 #New Nixon Events
 USA.ct.1.t:0 "금이 가는 유럽의 요새"
 USA.ct.1.desc:0 "President Nixon stared at the world map projected onto a screen in the White House briefing room. At the center was America, encircled, facing the Japanese and their colonial minions to the West and the Germans and their slave empire to the East.\n\nBut where the Japanese and the Americans had only recently escaped Armageddon's embrace in Hawaii, the Nazi empire was fraying at its seams. Hitler grew older and more infirm by the day; no amount of clever camera work and pre-recorded speeches could hide his creaking gait, his once-mesmerising oratory shrunken into senile rambling. Germany's moon landing was not a triumph - it was an epitaph.\n\nSecretary of Defense Melvin Laird looked up from the latest CIA intelligence brief on the German Reich. "It's a house of cards, Mr. President. Britain chafes under a foreign occupier, Brittany already deals with us in secret, and the Norwegians continue to resist decades of occupation. And their African colonies will wither on the vine without support."\n\n"All held together by a man who can't finish a sentence without forgetting how it started," Nixon noted.\n\n"When Hitler goes, his successors will fall over themselves to split the spoils, like Alexander's generals did in antiquity." Laird handed over a sheaf of documents from the CIA folder. "It's the opportunity of a lifetime. We'll never get another shot at crippling the Nazis like this.""
 USA.ct.1.a:0 "구세계로 다시 돌아갈 시기이다."
 USA.ct.2.t:0 "The South African Tango"
 USA.ct.2.desc:0 "Secretary of State William Rogers was well familiar with the steps of the 'South African Tango'. The South African ambassador would ask in vague generalities about admission into the OFN, but without any real plans for common defense or tariff liberalization. The Secretary would, in turn, respond with vague updates on South Africa's application, now nearly a decade old.\n\nIt suited both parties; the South Africans wanted the threat of OFN membership to cow the Germans, and the OFN needed to preserve the last democracy in Africa. Neither, however, wanted a German intervention, which OFN membership could provoke. Thus, the South African Tango continued on, without end.\n\n"How can I help you today, Ambassador?" Roger struck a neutral tone to hide his boredom; he was near-certain that the response would be entirely predictable. "We're doing very well, and about that OFN application" would be the usual response --\n\n"The Germans are making their move." Ambassador Willem Christiaan Naude declared. "Hertzog's Boer nationalists are talking to the Germans. South Africa is in danger, and we need America's help."\n\nThat got Roger's attention, as his stomach dropped at this most unexpected turn in the decade-long discourse. "What kind of help are we talking about?"\n\n"Financial, intelligence, but above all, military." Naude said firmly. "If the Boers and Germans want a fight, we won't make it easy for them.""

I hope we're not making a mistake, reaching out to - "\n\n"The Europeans, yes. We'll take care of it from here," Nixon replied brusquely before pressing his hand down on the receiver. Pressing the headset to his ear, he hurriedly dialed in a second number, and waited.\n\n"Director? You'll have your funds." Nixon hunched over the desk, flipping through the latest estimates from the CIA. "Yes, backchannel contacts with our consulate in Brest, filtering literature to the students in the universities, the works."\n\nA quiet moment. "And yes, yes, the weapons too. But that - that needs to be deniable. All through Brittany, and all surplus. Nothing new. Nothing that can be tied back to us. Speer wouldn't appreciate his enemies knowing we were arming his students."\n\nA final pause, followed by a nod, then the clang of the headset returning to the receiver. The funds began to be wired to the CIA's contacts in Brittany not thirty minutes later."
 USA_sen_bill.102.d_failed:0 "It was hard to imagine anything that would cause the R-D's to join with the NPP in opposition to their own President. Hell, Nixon had counted on it. Would his party really want to hold hands with those ideologically adulterous political nutcases?\n\nAs it turned out, when it came to reaching out to Nazi Germany, they would.\n\nNever mind that the intent was to support the one German who wasn't reflexively hostile to American interests. Never mind that taming Germany politically would let America focus on Japan. Never mind that yes, everything would need to be kept hush-hush, since anything overt would kill any chance of Speer's succession.\n\nNo, it had turned out that America was nowhere near ready for that kind of hardheaded foreign policy. The NPP called him a traitor, the Democrats called him nuts, and his own Republicans were calling him misguided. The same people who had lauded Kennedy as a hero for preserving the status quo in Hawaii were deriding Nixon as a fool for trying to seize upon the weaknesses of America's enemies.\n\nNixon fumed, pouring himself a shot of whiskey from the bottle kept under the desk. The shortsightedness, the partisanship, the sheer hypocrisy! It would make anyone want a drink, propriety be damned."

Whether they agree with us - and work to get the budget passed - is another matter."

 USA_sen_bill_desc_102:0 "The immense backlash to the Wallace administration has all but ensured that civil rights is a no-brainer in American politics, and as such, we have the opportunity to pass a Civil Rights Act of our own. This law would officially ban segregation nationwide, desegregate the armed forces, and institute a series of voting rights protections, to be enforced by the Department of Justice. While some on the far right are loudly protesting this act, nobody listens to them much anymore. If this law passes, it would be clear that the United States of America has left the shadow of George Wallace's paeans to "states' rights", and is entering the bright sunshine of human rights."

 RD_D_compromise_b_103:0 "We won't fall on our swords for Nixon's sake!"
 RD_D_compromise_desc_103:0 "Some days, Vice-President John F. Kennedy hated his job. It wasn't just because President Nixon was a mercurial, ornery bastard. No, it was because sometimes Nixon would saddle Kennedy with the dirty work - to risk his reputation to save the President's. Now, not a year after talking the Japanese down, the President wanted to bankroll the Nazis ('but only the nice ones'), and Kennedy would talk the Democrats into supporting it.\n\nAs expected, Wallace F. Bennett and Al Gore Sr. both stared at Kennedy like he'd grown a second head.\n\n"Jesus, Jack!" Gore finally exclaimed. "You know your dad's reputation is still in the gutter over the war. How can you be okay with this?"\n\n"The president sure has it out for you after Hawaii," Bennett remarked. "But we're still being dragged down over losing the war. If this goes public, we'll be wiped out politically."\n\nThe comments stung deeply, but Kennedy made his pitch regardless. "Germany's rotting from the inside. We put Speer in power, and Germany will be in chaos as the various cliques fight him tooth and nail. We're doing this to end Germany, not help it!"\n\nAfter a long silence, Bennett spoke. "Even if you convince us, what about the rest of the caucus? We could be looking at another set of defections to the NPP. Can we afford that?""

 RD_R_compromise_desc_103:0 "An uncomfortable silence settled in the Oval Office as soon as Nixon outlined his plan to covertly support Albert Speer in the impending succession crisis in Germany. Lyndon B. Johnson and Nelson Rockefeller looked at each other worriedly.\n\n"Let me get this straight," Rockefeller said incredulously. "You want to use taxpayer money to covertly support a leading figure in the Nazi party? Not the British resistance, or the Russian warlords, but the Nazis?"\n\n"When Nelson puts it that way, it sounds like you're losing your marbles, Richard." Johnson drawled. "Hard to believe you're the same guy who put the screws to the German-American Bund with McCarthy years ago."\n\n"Just listen, damnit!" Nixon growled. "Speer's the only candidate to succeed Hitler who's even remotely inclined to talk to us. We get him into office, we can string Germany along with promises of lifting the embargo, so we can focus on Japan. His student radicals will keep Speer too busy to cause trouble. This isn't a threat; it's an opportunity."\n\nAnother worried silence. "If you really want this to happen, we can get the caucus to fall in line." Johnson finally said. "But it'll be a helluva fight getting everyone to agree to this. Hell, you might have people jump ship like Margaret Chase Smith did.""

 USA_Cracking_The_Steel_Curtain_desc:0 "In the war's aftermath, Germania drew a line hugging the stretch of Europe's coast between Norway's fjords and the Strait of Gibraltar. Along its length rose a string of watchtowers, seawalls and concertina wire, their seams held together by trillions of Reichsmarks and the Führer's Aryan will. This stranglehold over the Old World goes by deceptive names like the Einheitspakt and Fortress Europa. The Free World calls it for what it is: a Steel Curtain.\n\nThe Volkshalle would have one believe that the Steel Curtain is as the Gibraltar Dam: impregnable, insurmountable, everlasting. In truth, the Curtain is pregnant with rot, surmounted by power struggles, and frail on its deathbed -- much like its architect Hitler. Subtle blows can make gaps out of its rustiest sections; there liberty's torchlight can filter back into the continent afresh."

They also assumed the German government had held true to its promises thereafter. Moreover, they assumed the German army had no business prevailing against the combined forces of two world empires, and that they will fold in a second war as they had in the first.\n\nGermany proved them wrong on all three accounts by raising the swastika over Paris and London. On that ignoble climax has America since been forced to leave its Allies' governments to Hitler's mercy.\n\nOperative word, says the CIA: governments. With an appropriately sized black budget, the Allies' restive peoples will be forgotten no longer."

Theirs is a bond inadequately explained were one only to examine small parcels of both their histories, whether as erstwhile colony and overlord, as adversaries in the world stage, or as allies against the fascist menace.\n\nThough Britain's wooden wall had broken before the Reich's assailments and made puppets of their free men, America's heart and mind yearns still to wrest their freedoms back. Luckily, a force which can effect such exists in Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. President Nixon pledges to uphold the Special Relationship both before and when America's other plays its hand."

 USA_Encourage_Claudes_ascendancy_desc:0 "Contrary to the image they present, His Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance is in practice an ideologically diverse coalition of insurrectionists working under a common, albeit transient, cause. Free England's fighters harbor their own visions for the nation's future -- proaction now, President Nixon's advisers suggest, will guarantee the inevitable power struggle's prevailing vision comporting comfortably to the Free World's own course.\n\nOne of the resistance's most agreeable factionheads also stands out as its most surprising: English Army general Claude Auchinleck. How India's former commander-in-chief has hidden his duplicity from London is a mystery; in any case, the man regaled Langley's contacts with fond recollections of America's valiant defense against Sealion. That, and a promise that Parliament will more formally parley with the OFN once the current situation is resolved."

Similarly, America has no shortage of guns -- pistols, machine guns, factory-fresh M14s, leftover Stens from the Second World War, perhaps an armored car or three in a warehouse -- and their corresponding ammunition. What, one may ask, will an assemblage of angry men do with weapons brought free of charge from a land which only has too many for itself?\n\nThe answer might surprise. After all, a free England expects creativity out of her every fighting tar."

The Germanic peoples' shared destiny, in Germania's presumable fever dreams, supersedes queries laden with common sense such as "How many Norwegians buy their tripe?" and "How many Germans would give their lives for Oslo?"\n\nThere at least exists an answer to the first question. Namely, scant few outside of the collaborator government's sway. Were the Einheitpakt a line of dominoes, Langley surmises, then Norway's piece wobbles to and fro near the front.

By now a whole generation of Europeans have been taught that free will and the rights of man are assumptions, rather than the principal axioms which they are. Fascism's stain on Europe's ancient societies will linger for decades before it fades away -- if it ever fades at all.\n\nBut no volume of Nazi indoctrination can excise man's impulse to seek the illicit: the unknown, made alluring by its forbidden nature. How far the world has strayed that common decency is merely an exotic import to the Reich's citizenry... but they yearn for it regardless. America will give them however much of it they wish to consume through Brittany's unfettered ports."

Their operations, in turn, have improved in both tempo and effect. As arms shipments adopt tight schedules without authorities' notice and agents slip into and out of Fortress Europa with a revolving door's ease, the two countries' resistances ask Washington's leave to form closer ties with The Company.\n\nFor his part, President Nixon recalls the OSS's legendary exploits in its short-lived record. He believes a well-supported attempt to replicate its success deserves his full support."

Though the inevitable power struggle's severity had caught Capitol Hill off guard, America must still issue a formal response to Europe's latest crisis. Deadlock has unsurprisingly arisen over what said response should be.\n\nTo both parties' outrage, President Nixon suggests offering diplomatic recognition to Albert Speer. The noted reformist may ultimately be a Nazi, he defends, but no better opportunity to steer Germany from its excesses exists than in his accession as the Reich's new Führer.

Like Hercules, its armies and fleets ventured towards the continent's westernmost edge to wrest wealth and glory from Europe's giants. Like Hercules, they halted at a body of water, in this case the River Ganges, and ventured no further.\n\nBut unlike Hercules, they feasted merrily on their spoils for years hence. Now even grasping its empire's edges has become a Herculean labor for Tokyo's corpulent digits.

To say that the situation of the Republican-Democrats is dire would be the understatement of the century. Enter former Speaker of the House John McCormack, a man who never expected to hold the reins of power who has regardless found them thrust into his hands. At such a dark moment in America's history, McCormack will certainly have his work cut out for him.\n\nWith the election approaching, McCormack's tenure as President will be short. He has no intentions of running in the election, instead simply resolving to hold the Oval Office for the coming months until a new Commander-in-Chief can be nominated. However, with his party in shambles and the National Progressive Party making unprecedented gains, he intends to use his brief tenure to try and right the ship and save the Republican-Democrats from ruin.\n\nThe tarnished legacy of Nixon will need to be addressed, a matter President Kennedy was unable to attend to in his tragically brief rule. The fallout of the South Africa War that Nixon thrust the country into will need to be carefully managed as well. If McCormack can successfully put out the flames that his party is currently engulfed in and restore some semblance of dignity to the government, the Republican-Democratic party may just manage to pull through - or at the very least, survive absolute electoral decimation."

Restoring party unity will be critical to allay the nation's panic and prevent a mass defection of voters from the Republican-Democrats. "

By presenting himself as a non-partisan element, uninvolved in the unfortunate scandals of the past, McCormack can distance himself from the taint of the Nixon presidency.

President McCormack intends to go on the offensive, calling upon all red-blooded Americans to stand firm against radicalism.

We must not only win the war, but win it quickly. If we can minimize the amount of time America spends bogged down in this quagmire, we can score a great victory for the United States that we can ride all the way to the polls.

Then Nixon lied and Kennedy died, and suddenly this Boston-born son of a hod carrier found himself thrust into the highest office in the land.\n\nThe days seemed to blur together as he struggled to gather himself. The Oval Office was a whirlwind of activity, endless lines of politicians and secretaries rushing to give him the lay of the land. "More rioting in the South" cried one. "Latest casualty reports from South Africa, Mr President" said another. The podium at the press conferences was another beast. He had lost count of the amount of times he had uttered the phrases "national tragedy" and "difficult times for us all" in front of flashing cameras over the last few days. Finally, whenever he found himself a brief moment to relax, he would pick up the newspaper and read all about the grim poll forecasts and the endless rumor mill and the countless reports of anti-war protests and continuing civil rights clashes and lines of coffins returning from overseas.\n\nOne night, sleep truly eluded him, and he found himself in the Oval Office, sitting in darkness save only for the lights flooding in from the White House lawn. His presidency would not be a successful one. He accepted that. He made no plans to run in the election to try and legitimize or extend his rule.

McCormack promised swift offensives, influxes of support equipment, various dates by which Quelimane and Luanda would surely be in American hands, and many other bold suggestions. The reporters asked tough questions - how would this effect the economy? Could the soldiers hope to cross such vast distances in such a short time? How would such an offensive affect the wellbeing of the men? The claims flowed freely, and the questions came back even firmer, for what seemed like hours.\n\nAfterwards, McCormack found himself only able to hope that his words would sway the public back.

Newspapers, stat sheets, comuniques from all across the country; the contents of the papers were varied, but on each of them he had circled the particular stats he was looking for - the polls.\n\nThe New York Times said the R-Ds stood a good chance in Iowa, while the Boston Globe predicted a bloodbath in the NPP's favor. Pollsters in Illinois seemed confident that the Republican senator there would keep his seat, but the news from Louisiana was not so encouraging. Endlessly, McCormack gorged himself on poll numbers, feeling his heart sink at every poor showing and subsequently soar at every promising result.\n\nYet he felt himself growing increasingly frustrated as the pollsters seemed incapable of agreeing with one another, and the final result remained as unclear as ever. The uncertainty made him feel sick to his stomach. He knew he hadn't always made the right choices, and the NPP were stronger now than they had ever been before. Nixon and Kennedy were the reason he was in this mess, yet history would remember him as the man who made or broke the Republican Democrats.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the official vote counts began, McCormack felt his eyelids begin to droop.

This fear is no longer countered by conventional means. With enemy bombers, it was a simple enough task to send interceptors to shoot them down. Now, however, ballistic missiles fly far higher and faster than even the fastest jets, and as a result, can no longer be countered conventionally.\n\nAs a solution, the Department of Defense has envisioned the Sentinel Program. In it, a series of low-range, anti-ballistic missile sites will be placed around the continental United States. If enemy missiles come nearby, these sites will fire guided missiles in response to intercept and destroy them. While these won't be able to do much against large ICBMs like those expected from the Reich or Japan, they should be able to shoot down the short-range missiles that our enemies place in their puppets close to us."

The American Military has yet to fully adopt the ideas learned from the Second World War, that maneuver and speed are the way of the future. As of right now, that changes. America will no longer be on the backfoot in tactics and strategy; rather, it will rush ahead with new, innovative combat concepts that will put it at the forefront of military doctrine. Among these innovations are helicopter-focused infantry, highly mobile ground units to outflank and surround enemy positions, and advanced naval detection technology and protocols. America has seen the future of warfare, and the future is American."

However, Bennett's idea of trade was to move high paying manufacturing jobs from America's great cities to areas of the world that had weak unions, little protections and no need to pay their workers much above subsistence levels, and then selling what was made back to America. While this made the big companies that still owned the factories and the distribution methods rich, and helped those countries bolster their economies, it put thousands out of work here at home, and rippled through the American economy. We should rectify this balance, encourage the companies to return home and employ our citizens, even if it does make our friends and allies angry."

The overall effect is furthering the sentiment that the Philippines is a damaged vassal, and not a free nation in its own right."\n\n"Good. Is Langley recommending that we continue with this program?"\n\n"They are indeed."\n\n"I assumed as much. They have my authorization to carry on."\n\n"Thank you, Mr. President. Now, on to the next item...""

 USA.1912.t:0 "A Blast in Manila"
 USA.1912.desc:0 "Word has just arrived from Manila. Last night, an improvised explosive device at the Gaiety Theater, one of the city's famed movie houses, killed over a dozen and maimed many more. Our garrison, in conjunction with city police, have begun locking down neighborhoods and breaking down doors, but no concrete leads have emerged thus far. There are, after all, countless rebel groups in the Philippines, more than one of which has already claimed responsibility through graffiti, leaflets, and pirate radio.\n\nAccompanying the update on the bombing was a new request for security and economic aid to the Aquino government. More guns, more bullets, some surplus vehicles for their security forces, and money to hire new police thugs. Filipino industries can make cheap goods for Sphere markets, but their defense sector is practically nonexistent. Besides, it would hardly even qualify as a line item in our ministry budgets."
 USA.1912.a:0 "Send them the cash they need, and tell them to keep a closer eye on their theaters."

 USA.1913.desc:0 "WASHINGTON (AP)-President Richard Nixon met with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru at the White House today. The meeting, the first between Nixon and Nehru, was the first stop on the Prime Minister's visit to the United States, soon to be followed by multiple stops in Washington, Virginia, and New York. At the Oval Office, President Nixon reaffirmed America's commitment to deepening America's political and economic ties to India.\n\n"India is a vast nation, blessed with a multitude of resources and a rising population. It is the belief of this administration that the United States of America would be foolish if we did not embrace your republic, and all the opportunities that it offers the world."\n\nFollowing the President's remarks, Prime Minister Nehru returned with cordiality of his own.\n\n"The people of India are on the verge of great success in the fields of economics, societal progress, and national development. We wish to use this success to join hands with the free world, and I would like to thank the President for his efforts to bring our nations closer together.""

 USA.1914.desc:0 ""Mr. President, we believe that the best way to curtail Japanese economic and military power is to draw them into new and escalating conflicts. Get them bogged down in a new jungle war, and they'll feel the pain."\n\nPresident Nixon nods carefully, considering his advisor's comments. "Alright, Bob. Go on."\n\nOne of McNamara's aides walks up with a pair of rolled-up maps. Each one bears a detailed map of a Southeast Asian country. "Two of the largest potential targets are Indonesia and the Philippines. Indonesia is both a literal and political archipelago, riven by Japanese resource extraction, military regimes, and native collaborators. Meanwhile, the Philippines is a rebellious nation, as we know well, and the population is believed to be very resentful of their occupiers. Both countries have active rebel groups which we could use as proxies against Tokyo."\n\nNixon presses his hands together in a gesture of contemplation, staring at the black and red markings that dot the maps. "Okay, Bob. What form would this proxy warfare be taking?"\n\nMcNamara's aides pull out more maps, more lists, more explanations. And over the course of the morning, a bloody strategy to drive new knives into the Empire of Japan takes form."

All his titles, now only legacies to leave behind.\n\nIt was an uneventful and cold day when Brandt arrived to the United States of America. Such a contrast to when he held fiery speeches in front of thousands, and spearheaded negotiations that led to the eventual peace that descended upon the Einheitspakt. Even with his boundless optimism, he was worried.\n\nBrandt knew that he could never step foot into Germany again. He was a man in exile; forever destined to be cast out for his actions, punished when justice was a degraded and humiliated concept. Yet he did not feel shame, or guilt, or anger. Brandt's only concern remained with the future at large.\n\nWould Germany relent, shedding its bloodied history of the past few decades and embrace what had made it so strong, or would it falter, and remain prey to the forces that wished to doom everyone to the darkness of fascism?"

It had better not be, you told me there would be no hang ups on that issue."\n\n"Not at all, Mister President," McNamara shifted slightly in his seat. "The Director of Central Intelligence actually asked me to have you convene the council." He glanced to the director, who held a pipe to his lips, his mouth curled into a glib smile.\n\n"Get on with it, then." the president urged. With a puff of smoke, he leaned in and began.\n\n"Mister President, we have contacts high up within the German colonial administration in Madagascar. We have total reason to believe that they have some ... misgivings about their loyalties to Berlin. With the weakening of the German empire, and with Hitler becoming increasingly ill, it's become apparent that a conflict may break out on the island sooner rather than later. We have word that rebels are planning to make their move soon, and the local government is divided."\n\nNixon shrugged. "Who are these contacts? Can we be sure of their sincerity?" McNamara pushed his glasses further up his nose; for dramatic effect, the director puffed again from his pipe. "Mister President, our contact is Reich Commissar Emil Maurice."\n\nNixon seemed stunned for a moment, but collected himself quickly. "My God, that's great. And he has a direct line to Hitler?" The director nodded. "Maurice is one of Hitler's oldest confidants. Their relationship has been strained as of late -- which is partly why he wants out -- and his word, we think, is good." Nixon nodded in silence for several moments before continuing.\n\n"Well, dammit, keep me updated on this. If you find any way to breach the bastion, you let me know immediately.""
 USA.madagascar.1.a:0 "Let's see if we can make a dent in the Unity-Pakt."

 USA.madagascar.2.t:0 "The Perfect Storm"
 USA.madagascar.2.desc:0 ""Mister President, we believe the dam is about to burst in Madagascar."\n\nMaurice wanted out. The perfect storm of pressures and crises seemed about ready to completely tear the Indian Ocean island apart. The president sat down in his chair, switching the phone to his left hand as he shifted through some papers on his desk. "What's going on? I haven't had any information in my daily briefings on the issue. The last I heard was when we spoke right after we lifted that blockade."\n\n"Well, Mister President, there is a pandemic of black plague across the countryside. The Jews in the North are getting uppity, so to say, especially because of the chaos back in the mother country. SS units across the island have been in constant contact with Himmler and his underlings. Maurice is terrified he may be shot any day by his own guards. And the natives may revolt soon, as well. For what it's worth, we agree with his assessment that Madagascar is about to become a warzone."\n\nA perfect storm, alright. "Well, give it to me straight. What are our options? Realistically speaking, that is."\n\n"Well, Mister President, you have two realistic options. The Agency can affect the delivery of several crates of weapons -- rifles, grenades, pistols, the like -- for Maurice to hand out to his loyalists. The other option is to simply hand him a lump sum of money. He can then use that sum for bribery, or purchases of his own, or what have you.""

 USA.madagascar.3.t:0 "Shalom auf Madagaskar!"
 USA.madagascar.3.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported the final victory of the Jewish partisan movement on Madagascar. A local militia commander, near the city center of Toamasina, was quoted as saying that their success was "just the first of many plans of revenge" for the horrors of previous decades.\n\nChaos still reigns in many parts of the island as what remaining German loyalists flee or go into hiding. As the beginnings of a proper government begin to form, however, there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Director of Central Intelligence is upset over the outcome. For his part, President Nixon is quietly annoyed, but publicly exuberant. A reporter for CBS News quoted an aide of the president as being "excited for the possibilities of a free Madagascar in the future," and hailing "the beginning of the end of global fascist terror."\n\nStill, few Americans even know what a Madagascar is, much less understand the complexities of the issues that have led to this moment."
 USA.madagascar.3.a:0 "It could have been worse, I guess."

 USA.madagascar.4.t:0 "The German Loyalists Hold The Line"
 USA.madagascar.4.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported a seemingly final victory for the German garrison on Madagascar. Large convoys of trucks, loaded with captured militiamen, partisans, and suspected collaborators and sympathizers -- Jewish, natives, and others alike -- are photographed and filmed on their way into the countryside -- where their fate is unknown.\n\nEven despite the German victory, chaos still reigns in many parts of the country. Command hierarchy among the troops suffers greatly the further from the capital one goes, with revenge killings and attacks carried out on unsuspecting civilians and villages -- regardless of their true or suspected sympathies. It will take a great deal of time for the economy to recover, as well. The scars of war are never fully healed.\n\nThe White House has issued a statement hammering "Nazi tyranny" and has declared its intention to double its efforts in combating "global fascist terror". The bellicose rhetoric hasn't inspired any responses of note from Germany or Japan, and whether the president's statement is true or not remains to be seen. For now, Madagascar will remain under foreign domination, its people exploited and oppressed in the name of the glory of the Third Reich."
 USA.madagascar.4.a:0 "Another blow to liberty -- and the CIA."

 USA.madagascar.5.t:0 "A Crushing Victory"
 USA.madagascar.5.desc:0 ""Mister President, we've achieved a crushing victory! Our boys in Madagascar have won."\n\nSomething of an overstatement, [GetPresidentLastName] thought. He really preferred these phone conversations over meeting the man in person -- but now, he was growing tired even of this. "Yes, director. Congratulations on your operation. You did a hell of a job." Madagascar was now under OFN jurisdiction for the time being -- and hopefully would stay that way. But there were many questions of the future that remained to be answered.\n\n"No, Mister President, the success is all yours." There was an awkward pause. "Your statement to that reporter earlier today was very nice, if I do say so myself."\n\nNo shit, the president thought. "Yes, thank you. I think it's important we continually reinforce our intentions to support a transition to democracy. That's why we got involved in the first place, after all."\n\n"Yes, very good, Mister President," the director said. "With any luck, this is just the first of many great victories under this administration.""
 USA.madagascar.5.a:0 "Perhaps not a crushing victory, but a victory nonetheless."

 USA.madagascar.6.t:0 "Masters of Their Own House"
 USA.madagascar.6.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported a final victory for the native militias and rebel brigades on Madagascar. Flags of the colonial regime and of German are trampled and spat upon, torn to bits, and lit on fire; statues toppled; government collaborators beaten to within an inch of their lives or outright killed; and public monuments and government buildings defaced. For the first time since the 19th century, Madagascar is free.\n\nThe first pillars of the so-called Madagascarian Republic have been erected. Soon, tranquility, law, and peace will return to the island -- or so many hope. Of course, the result isn't exactly what the CIA or the president's closest allies hoped for, but a free people strongly opposed to German domination is a good friend, indeed.\n\nPresident [GetPresidentLastName], however, is wary. He remembers the crisis that gripped Guyana in its slide toward autocracy; in some ways, he sees similarities in the creation of the independent Madagascarian government. Only time may tell, however, whether Madagascar will truly embrace freedom."
 USA.madagascar.6.a:0 "We welcome the people of Madagascar into the concert of free nations."

 USA.madagascar.7.t:0 "Liberty Leading the People Again"
 USA.madagascar.7.desc:0 "The powers of the great coalitions and alliances of human history have always weighed back and forth like a great scale. And now, as the Unitypakt stumbled, OFN chose to strike at the opportune moment.\n\nAt the president's direction, and with significant monetary assistance from the State Department, the United Coalition Government of Madagascar, a sort of stop-gap measure, has been established. The endgoal of the intervention is the creation of an OFN-friendly sovereign government, completely free from German and Nazi influence. So far, the effort seems to have been successful.\n\nFuture politics is largely put aside in the name of total unity and opposition against the Germans and their agents. It will certainly not last, but for now there is stability among the friends to America and its OFN allies."

USA_reach_out_to_Riyadh_desc:0 "Saudi Arabia holds more cheap oil than any other nation on Earth. Miles of oil wells have stuck out of its dunes for decades, pumping millions of barrels of liquid gold a day. Italian colonialism expanded these lucrative fields to new plays underneath both the desert sands and the Persian Gulf. In a twist of irony, the Arabian Desert is now an oasis for a planet famished for oil.\n\nThe President's advisors unanimously believe King Faisal is America's ticket out of the Oil Crisis. However, its ideal method of approach is still subject to debate. Some believe Arabia needs firm reassurances from the Free World, up to and especially a tour de force. Conversely, others warn of the risks involved in repeating the South African and Indonesian debacles, instead advocating for diplomacy and more... clandestine, means to support the monarch."
USA_Securing_Our_Interests_desc:0 "America runs a race against an oil market on the brink of freefall; if it fails, then so too will its economy. In these precarious circumstances, mistakes made of haste are more easily forgiven if they ultimately preserve the country's fortunes.\n\nWashington is sure to make plenty of mistakes by intervening overtly in the Arabian peninsula, to say nothing of the political capital it needs to convince Congress and the people in favor of another foreign adventure. Rest easy knowing that the sacrifices we make now will pay off for millions of Americans' lives decades into the future. Prosperity, after all, makes forgiveness an easy choice."
USA_Gifts_For_The_King_desc:0 "King Faisal holds sway over a nation-state's embryo. He may have government, culture, recognition and rule of law - but without the guns to back its monopoly on violence, his dynasty may as well be one more tribe among the Arabian peninsula's lawless bedouins. More specifically, Bedouins vulnerable to the nationalistic overtures of a united Arab identity.\n\nHere America can leverage its economic largesse to buttress the young nation's precarious position. A shipment of guns both outdated and state-of-the-art will assure the King of his state's lastingness in the face of a subcontinent's worth of foes."
USA_King_Faisal_Im_CIA_desc:0 "The fruits of human intelligence compound with every year they operate within a country's borders. In turn, a well-established intelligence apparatus both forewarns and precludes enemy action, sometimes without their knowledge.\n\nWhich is why the CIA is so eager to expand their operations in the Middle East as of late. Our stiletto in the dark needs ample preparation time to conduct their covert deeds - we can satisfy their demands by sending them into the region before our armed forces. The Company will wreak their infamous havoc where we need it most soon enough."
USA_Operation_Sandstorm_desc:0 "As of late, the Joint Chiefs of Staff busied themselves with preparing America's most comprehensive expeditionary force since Indonesia. Drawing from the lessons learned in the past decade's two largest wars, the country's finest generals and admirals drew minute, extensive plans for a lightning war involving all four branches of the US Armed Forces. They described the immense firepower America's tanks, guns, ships and planes combined will demonstrate as a "shock and awe campaign" spanning the Middle East, routinely inspected for any flaws that may lead to another quagmire.\n\nAll told, the Pentagon assured America that Sandstorm will promise just that: a storm. Woe betide the fools who bar its path."
USA_Step_Up_Our_Shipments_desc:0 "Our army lives and dies by supply routes thousands of miles astride the East Coast and the Persian Gulf. As their principal supplier, said supply routes likewise dictate the Royal Saudi Land Forces' shape, tempo and effectiveness. Heavier combat necessitates several thousands more tons of shipment sent per day; should our logistics fail to meet the armies' demands, we will likely see both their ammunition and morale plummet deep enough to hit a reservoir of oil.\n\nThe simple solution is to increase the pace of convoys running extant routes. We can always rely on our capable merchant marine to implement this directive to their abilities' best."
USA_Black_Gold_Rush_desc:0 "One immeasurable benefit of direct cooperation with Saudi Arabia is direct access to their pipelines bursting full with oil. Their generosity has thus far ably stemmed the bleeding on America's economy since the Oil Crisis began. With war on their doorstep, and the US Army their most stalwart shield against it, the Saudis believe dedicating some of their valuable pumps solely for our army's consumption - after their extracts leave the refineries, of course - will service both themselves and us in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nReally, who are we to disagree?"
USA_Pick_Your_Targets_desc:0 "The CIA's contacts have proven their worth by providing every last iota of intelligence they can gather about our adversaries' leaders. Blueprints, photographs, sensitive documents, and even hearsay all blended into coherent narratives and routines involving the Middle East's most famous and infamous. The lax environments their abodes exhibit would scream danger to our agents - were they tasked with protecting them. Instead, the CIA saw only chances gaping wide open.\n\nWith the leaders' lives laid bare before the Company's omnipresent eyes, certain personages believe now is the most opportune time to plunge our stiletto in the dark behind their backs."
USA_Finding_Their_Leaders_desc:0 "Pan-Arabism is a mass movement, with its corresponding strengths, weaknesses, and weaknesses disguised as strengths. In particular, the ideology has mobilized millions throughout the Middle East around several charismatic ideologues like Arafat and al Sadat. If the presence of such men inflamed the people's passions, then would not their sudden, abrupt absence snuff these passions out?\n\nThe United States government has always been a staunch advocate of evidence based policy. As its foremost experts in unconventional policymaking, Langley has been tasked to make conclusive results out of Pan-Arabism's greatest progeny."
USA_In_For_The_Kill_desc:0 "What America needs the least in the middle of its greatest economic crisis since the Depression is a protracted conflict sucking its money and attention. South Africa and Indonesia had played merry hell on both - and that was with a healthy economy. From White House to janitor, America's government has wholeheartedly resolved to prevent Saudi Arabia from spiraling into a worse repeat of the last two wars that had wasted its energies and fortunes.\n\nTo this end, the President has requested that the Pentagon draw a time table for military operations in the Middle East, immediately followed by withdrawal plans upon the war's conclusion. If Washington has its way, then American soldiers will not spend any more time in the sandbox than they absolutely must."

USA.oilcrisis.1.t:0 "The Earth Bleeds"
USA.oilcrisis.1.desc:0 "The horrible fighting has begun again.\n\nBeneath the shifting sands of the Middle East oil pumps like blood through the veins of some slumbering primordial deity. Proboscoid derricks pierce the sediment in their hundreds, gluttonously sucking up the earth's bounty to feed the world's limitless thirst for petroleum. It is strange, absurd even, to think that the most valuable commodity in the world, and, indeed, the grease that spins society's cogs is little more than the corpses of prehistoric flora. And yet, every day, America burns through uncountable tons of this ancient biomass, without which our nation would grind to a screeching halt.\n\nPerhaps the only thing in the Middle East older than the land itself is the people. They wandered the sands for a thousand generations before the first city, and will surely do so again after the fall of the last. Entrenched in their ancient ways, they fought and married each other for millennia in the neverending dance of civilization, and every so often, as the years ground by, the cradle of humanity exploded into sudden and ferocious violence.\n\nOnce more, blood is spilled on the sand. Under the Italian boot for decades, the Arabs have risen up to form the nascent United Arab Republic, intent on expelling the foreigners from their homeland and taking claim of their own destiny. As the Italians desperately try to stop the spread of rebellion, the Saudi king watches from Riyadh, perhaps seeing his opportunity to grip the region in an iron fist.\n\nOur diplomatic staff, terrified of the distant explosions and gunfire they can hear from their offices, have been sending in frantic reports on the escalating crisis. Reading between the lines, the central message is clear: our oil supply is threatened. The situation appears bleak. America may soon find itself deprived of oil unless we act, soon and decisively. As the Middle East embroils itself in bloodshed, the policy-makers in Washington debate about what action to take, and our men in the Middle East are airlifted to safety, one thing is certain: it is happening again."

USA.oilcrisis.2.t:0 "Capital Is Commodities"
USA.oilcrisis.2.desc:0 "Wall Street is the heart of the American economy, and today it's beating harder than ever. Turmoil erupted on the trading floor after our plan to set prices on oil became public, and what can only be described as mass hysteria ensued as traders followed the trail of current events to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, realizing the way the wind was blowing.\n\nThankfully it proved to be a minor hiccup, and the chaos on the trading floor quickly died down. Despite the initial hullabaloo, setting prices on oil has allowed us to maintain control of Wall Street and keep the markets relatively stable, averting the economic disaster many of our advisors were certain was imminent.\n\nOf course, we've made a lot of people angry. Commodities traders in particular are unsurprisingly furious, but the anger of a gang of hair-gelled smooth-talking champagne-drinkers is a small price to pay to avoid economic meltdown."

USA.oilcrisis.3.t:0 "A Momentary Embolism"
USA.oilcrisis.3.desc:0 "Looming disaster has been avoided, for now, and oil flows again freely through America's veins thanks to our oil rationing and price-setting and the expansion of our domestic petroleum industry. Now our citizens can once again drive to their dead-end jobs and heat up their TV dinners without fear of impediment!\n\nAnd thank goodness for that, because without oil America would come apart like a house of cards in a tropical typhoon. Nevertheless, we can't let ourselves become complacent. The turmoil in the Middle East doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon, and although the brunt of the crisis has been averted for the time being, if the violence escalates we can expect a similarly chaotic impact on America's markets. Our oil supplies are already stretched pretty far, and the worse it gets the more draconian our response will have to be just to keep the wheels spinning.\n\nFrankly, the reports coming in from our men in the Middle East are getting bleaker by the day. Oil distribution is still far from secure, and it appears as if none of the players have the power to end this conflict quickly. Most worryingly, we've just received a report from the CIA about several UAR nations joining into a single political entity, but who's to say if it's accurate? All kinds of rumours are pouring in, and it's getting more and more difficult to separate the truth from the baseless gossip.\n\nRight now there's no way to tell which way the wind is blowing, and that kind of uncertainty isn't good for anyone. We'll have to wait and see, but at least it seems the worst has been avoided.\n\nFor now."

USA.oilcrisis.4.desc:0 "As the airplane's doors opened, the heat hit Bruce in the face like a nuclear blast. To a Minnesota boy used to freezing winters and mild summers, it was like stepping into a kiln. Christ, he knew it was going to be hot but this was something else. Lucifer himself would sweat in this.\n\nBruce gathered his resolve and started down the airstair to the scorching tarmac of the runway. He could already feel his shirt moistening and, after only a few seconds in Riyadh, he understood instantly why the Arabs wore those billowing robes.\n\nParked ostentatiously in the middle of the airstrip was a Rolls Royce, dark green as far as he could tell through the light reflecting blindingly off the chassis. The chauffeur opened the rear door. Bruce gave him a nod and ducked inside.\n\nGod is merciful: it was air-conditioned. Hell's bells, thought Bruce, an air-conditioned car is a luxury even back in the States and here's one in the middle of the damn desert. Sitting opposite him, and flanked by two extremely large bodyguards, was Crown Prince Khalid, swathed in enough white cloth to sew a sail for a Spanish treasure galleon. He shook Khalid's hand as the Crown Prince scrutinised him through his aviator sunglasses and responded to his pleasantries in impeccable English. "A pleasure, Mr. Laingen," he said, although his face betrayed little.\n\nAs they were driven to the Palace, Bruce and the Crown Prince stiltedly discussed the region's ongoing conflict, Bruce assuring the Prince of America's unwavering commitment to Saudi Arabia in the face of the crisis. Nevertheless, as the two discussed the merits of this or that policy, Bruce couldn't get the Rolls Royce out of his head. This man is driven in a Rolls, he thought, when his grandfather rode a camel. Would his grandson also drive a Rolls, or would the House of Saud once again ride camels over Arabia's shifting sands?"

USA.oilcrisis.5.t:0 "Smoke on the Wind"
USA.oilcrisis.5.desc:0 "Bruce Laingen sat resting his head on his palm, reading and re-reading the communique from Washington. He'd been ensconced in the American embassy for days, drafting policy plans in the searing heat, ceiling fans going full bore. They often revolved so fast he was half-afraid they'd spin off their axes and decapitate him. Frankly, now he'd received his orders, he was almost starting to hope for it.\n\nWith a sigh, he called in Agent Hunt, one of the latest concrete cowboys Langley had sent him. Like most Agency men in the field, Hunt was a red-blooded American with a taste for beer, football and shooting foreigners. Bruce had an almost instantaneous dislike for the man, but if they were going to be forced to work together, they may as well try and be civil. After all, personality conflicts aside, they were striving for the same goal. Bruce lit a cigarette, and offered one to Hunt. He tossed the communique over to Hunt's side of the desk.\n\n"The President's decided to put boots on the ground," he said laconically, in a carefully neutral tone of voice. He had become paranoid lately that his office might be bugged, by either the Saudis or the Agency, and did not want to give them any indication that he was doubting the efficacy of the slowly escalating policy of interventionism in the Middle East.\n\nHunt glanced over the document, then flicked his eyes to Bruce's. "We'd better get ready then, is what you're saying," he said, a barely perceptible grin on his face.\n\nBruce nodded. "Get everyone organized, the first of them are gonna be here pretty damn soon and we're nowhere near ready to receive them. And for god's sake, get Frank to keep the Saudis off my damn back!"\n\nHunt stood, and flashed Bruce a pearly white smile as he made for the door. "Hot damn, it's gonna be just like another South Africa!""
USA.oilcrisis.5.a:0 "The overture begins"

USA.oilcrisis.6.t:0 ""
USA.oilcrisis.6.desc:0 "Bruce examined King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the allegedly great reformer, through narrowed eyes, shimmering hazily in the cigarette smoke that filled the great banquet hall. He found it darkly amusing to see the normally so uptight Saudis sitting around smoking, drinking and groping dancing girls, all the vices they spent so much hypocritical breath decrying.\n\nThe King himself had apparently been handsome in his youth, but Bruce couldn't see any evidence of it now. Surrounded by giggling wives and concubines a third of his age, the King was bloated, droopy and covered in liver spots. He reminded Bruce of a scoop of rum and raisin ice cream that had been left sitting in the sun.\n\nAnd yet, despite all outward appearances, King Faisal was one of the shrewdest political operators he'd ever met. The man was wily as a fox.\n\nBruce noticed suddenly that the King was looking in his direction. He beckoned for Bruce to come to him at the other end of the table, and Bruce went without hesitation. When the King beckons, you come.\n\nThe King liked to project an urbane aura when speaking to Westerners, but Bruce could detect the hint of menace lurking beneath the King's friendly facade. "My dear Mr. Laingen! I did not know you were here. A pleasure to see you once again in the Palace! I trust things are progressing at the Embassy?"\n\nSneaky bastard, thought Bruce. He knows full well I was on the guest list. His reply, however, was far more deferential. "Yes, your majesty. Our defence and intelligence network has been thoroughly established. Our agents are at your disposal to root out the traitors to your rule."\n\nThe King smiled, but his eyes were as cold and immovable as a glacier. "My dear Bruce, I must commend you! You do your nation credit. We are proud to have the United States as our ally."\n\nBruce kept his face carefully neutral. Are you?, he wondered."

USA.oilcrisis.7.desc:0 "We could hardly have expected our deployment of ground combat troops to Saudi Arabia to remain covert for long, and since it's gone public we've become inundated with opposition to our escalation of the American presence in the Middle East. Students and South Africa veterans have staged anti-war demonstrations in several universities and parks across America, and they've made public their plans to march on Washington to call for a halt in deployment.\n\nSenators from both sides of the party divide are being buried in angry letters from constituents, many of them who had family who died in Africa, and consequently are urgently calling in Congress for a freeze in troop deployments or, for the more radical Senators, a total withdrawal.\n\nWe'd lose serious face in the international community if we just pulled out, and we can't abandon the Saudis, slimy bastards though they may be, without jeopardising our oil supply. All we can do is hope tensions don't keep escalating and we get stuck in a war we can't win. Goddamn it all, why does such an oil-rich region have to be so unstable?"

Rag-tag guerrillas are no match for American airpower.\n\nUnfortunately, their friends might be. German diplomats have made their nation's displeasure clear, calling us hypocrites for running operations in the no-fly zone. Germany's opposition, of course, does not come from a love of peace but from a desire to protect their sometime-allies in the pan-Arabist movement, presumably afraid that an unfriendly faction taking control of the region could throttle their oil supply.\n\nUltimately, what do we care what they think? Germany is unlikely to put boots on the ground in the Middle East in order to avoid a confrontation, and, after all, we're in desperate need of the oil too. Better we pump it into America rather than allow it to grease the gears of the cruellest superpower in history."

USA.oilcrisis.9.t:0 "Taming the Beast"
USA.oilcrisis.9.desc:0 "You'd have to be a damn fool to trust the Saudis, but they're the only native group in the region even slightly friendly to the US. Nobody could say that they were reliable, but having the Saudis on our side gives us a valuable beachhead into the Middle East to protect exports of precious, precious oil.\n\nNevertheless, the values of Saudi Arabia are distasteful even to the most hardline reactionaries back home, and it's getting increasingly difficult to justify our alignment with a nation so diametrically opposed to the virtues of freedom and liberty that Americans hold dear. It's hard to see the Saudis as the lesser of two evils when they deny women even the most basic rights and behead political and religious prisoners like some kind of medieval warlord. Some commentators back home are even comparing the pan-Arabists to the American revolutionaries of the 18th century, which, presumably, would cast us in the role of King George.\n\nIf we're going to back the Saudis, it's our responsibility to try and nudge them away from hardline conservative Salafism. The idea of a republican or, Allah forgive me for uttering this word, secular Arabia is a pipe dream, but if we carefully influence Saudi thought leaders we can perhaps engender positive social change in Arabia and avoid the mistakes of the old apartheid regime in Guyana.\n\nThe CIA's current plan is a covert operation to influence the hearts and minds of Saudi Arabians who might be sympathetic to our ideals, mainly non-Salafist intellectuals and the petit bourgeois. The Saudi upper crust would balk at sudden change, but perhaps over the next few decades of our association with them we can nudge the oil kingdom in a brighter direction."

USA.oilcrisis.10.desc:0 "They are streaming across the border in their tens of thousands, many of them with little more than the babies in their arms and the clothes on their backs. Every war creates refugees, but the sudden brutality of the conflict in the Middle East is annihilating ancient ways of life and sending people fleeing from the land their ancestors have occupied for centuries in a way never seen before, and they're all flocking to what appears to be the last remaining beacon of stability in the region: the Saudi Kingdom.\n\nMost of them aren't exactly friendly to Saudi or Western interests, but more than that, they fear and hate the men who expelled them from their homes. As the pan-Arabists spread their tentacles over more and more of the Middle East, that hate could be a powerful weapon against an increasingly dangerous enemy.\n\nOur man in Riyadh, veteran diplomat Bruce Laingen, has presented us with a plan drawn up by two CIA operatives under his command, Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt. It suggests training and arming the refugees and sending them back into the fray as a totally deniable army to fight the pan-Arabists without smearing red, white and blue across the Middle East. If it seems like we're uninvolved, the local response will likely be far more amenable to a native army whose interests just happen to coincide with our own. This could be a way for us to exert our influence in the region without having to send our boys to die in the desert."

The towering date palms let very little light into the courtyard, and in the twilight it was filled with a dim purple glow. By a shimmering pool sat King Faisal, sipping coffee from a silver goblet.\n\nThe King motioned for Bruce to sit. At some unspoken signal the garden was suddenly empty. The King set his coffee down and gazed into the pool. At last he began to speak, not looking up.\n\n"America is a young country, is it not? Forged in the fires of revolution some two centuries past. Indeed, the very ideals that drive your nation are scarcely older than America itself."\n\nHe glanced up to meet Bruce's eyes, and Bruce shuddered in the coldness of his gaze. "We are an old culture. The legacy of the Arab people goes back far further than your own, our way of life is founded on values and ideals millennia older than yours. Our faith in God is the driving force behind our society, tradition its cornerstone. You must come to understand this or someday the desert will consume you as it has so many others."\n\nThe garden darkened as the sun slipped below the horizon. "I love to sit here after the rain," confided the King, leaning back in his chair and folding his hands over his belly. "The coolness after a storm is a rare pleasure in Riyadh. Imagine the hubris to construct a garden such as this! This palace and its garden will be here long after America has crumbled into the sands of time, and the ways of our people will exist as unchanged in the years to come as they have for so many centuries." He glanced over at Bruce. "I hope you understand."\n\nBruce heard the message loud and clear: the King wanted an end to the CIA's program of liberalization. Heart in his throat, he felt a sudden burst of fury at the veiled threats of this decrepit old wreck. "Your people once built great gardens in Cordoba, your majesty, before the forces of Christendom burned them to the ground. You should consider the fate of the Moors before you make threats."\n\nWith that he rose, and left the King to sit alone in the twilit darkness of his garden."

We're perfectly happy to accept American money and American guns, but they can keep their corrupt values. It's time we identify those they've influenced and make sure they're silenced. The Americans can hardly just pull their aid, not when they're as oil-starved as they are, and that might be all we need to put an end to the toxic ideas spewing forth from the American embassy.\n\nOur ways have survived the long ages and a parade of conquerors, whose bones lie forgotten under the sands while we carry on.

Our new planes are set to soon arrive at Port Dammam, and our boys in Riyadh have already drawn up plans for ambitious missions against the pan-Arabist menace.\n\nWe don't plan to let the Middle East and its oil escape our grasp just 'cause the limp-wrists back home balk at the idea of dropping a few million tons of bombs on people who are fighting, as we once did, for their freedom, liberty and right to self-determination.

Our supply of oil is not ensured, while our enemies in the region are starved of their main source of funding.\n\nNow that we've got a good, tight stranglehold over outgoing trade, we can throttle the enemy until they're crying uncle.

USA.oilcrisis.15.desc:0 "Bruce sipped at his drink of choice, a Long Island iced tea, as Agent Hunt sat across from him in his sweltering office, telling him in furiously animated detail of how the Saudi police have begun to harass American operatives, irrespective of whether or not they're involved in the liberalization program. The icy cold drink and the frantically rotating ceiling fans did little to cool him down.\n\nAfter Hunt left in a huff, swearing that something had to be done about "those damn slimy Arabs", Bruce sat back, wondering what was to be done. He got up and walked to the window, flicking open the Venetian blinds. Past the low, white buildings of Riyadh he could see the endless desert expanse, stretching all the way out into the scorching nothingness of the Empty Quarter. The view reminded him often of what Minnesota might look like if it was covered in sand. Like Arabia, the only round things in Minnesota were the fruit on the trees and some of the people.\n\nAnd yet, despite the similarity of the land they inhabited, the people of Minnesota and Arabia couldn't have been more different. He often found himself unable to understand why the locals did anything they did, why they held onto these bizarre, archaic beliefs. It was like living in a kingdom from the Dark Ages that had been dumped into the twentieth century.\n\nBruce closed the blinds and went to sit back behind his desk, slumping into the chair, still moist with his sweat. The authoritarian Saudi police would have to be dealt with if Americans were to operate unrestricted through the country. The Saudis would hate it, of course, and he had little doubt that the King and the Crown Prince would try every possible tactic to keep the status quo, but if they didn't stop harassing American operatives they'd feel the wrath of Uncle Sam.\n\nHe took a page and began to draft up some ideas to handle the situation, narrowing it down to two main contenders: play nice with the Saudis, maybe throw them a bone or two, or serve them a veiled threat by reminding them that America could pull out and cut off their lifeline if they didn't get back over the line."

Bruce had spent the morning in a series of meetings with a rotating gang of Saudi officials, ministers of one sort or another, all of whom looked exactly the same: portly, bearded men wearing aviator sunglasses and enough white cloth to make a hot air balloon. Bruce was forced to repeat himself with each one of them: reform their authoritarian and overzealous police force, or suffer a reduction in American funding.\n\nTheir reaction was invariably the same. It consisted of a brief explanation of the importance in the kingdom of Sharia law, tradition, faith, yadda yadda. All stuff he'd heard before, and like before he found it impossible to believe after seeing what the Saudi upper crust were like behind closed doors. When he had requested to meet with the King, or the Crown Prince, he was told blankly that they were not receiving visitors. Frankly, he wasn't surprised he was on the King's shit-list after their little confrontation in the garden, but now he couldn't even talk to him?\n\nSo the Saudis wanted to play hardball did they? Well, two could play at that game. Back in his stifling office, Bruce wondered how to deal with them. God knew he wanted to turn the screws on the bastards, but the angel on his shoulder was being very insistent in telling him to take the high road and back off. Even so, he couldn't shake off his anger at their condescension, brushing him off like he wasn't threatening to throttle their aid. He narrowed his eyes. Surely they had to be bluffing...?"

He swung to his terrified secretary, a cringing suburbanite from Long Island. "Get the hell out!" he spat. She vanished from the room faster than Bruce's hopes for a quiet day without trouble from the Saudis.\n\nBruce slumped into his chair, the leather instantly sticking his shirt to his back. It was the Chinese, he recalled, who cursed people by wishing them to live in interesting times. The Saudis were making his life extremely interesting indeed. His attempt to intimidate the Saudis by threatening to pull out had been a complete and utter failure. He could almost feel Faisal and Khalid and the rest of the aviator-wearing bastards laughing at him in the Palace.\n\nBruce laid his head in his hands. The Saudis knew America needed them, and they knew America was desperate for oil. He was supposed to be working them, and yet somehow they'd maneuvered him into a corner. Faisal was calling the shots now, and he had sent a letter filled with extremely thinly veiled threats, in essence a demand for the CIA's social liberalization program to be discontinued and for American interference in Saudi internal politics to be immediately halted. There was the suggestion that further interference could result in a butterfly effect leading to a halt in oil shipments to the United States. It didn't take a genius to read between the lines there.\n\nWell, Bruce thought, they've sure got us over a barrel here. He sighed. After all, what did he care about democracy in the Middle East? As long as the oil kingdom kept up the shipments, Washington would be happy."

The usual suspects, in other words.\n\nBruce plastered a smile on his face, hoping he didn't look too ingenuous. After their tiff in the garden, he was surprised but glad the King had agreed to meet with him. He may have grown to hate the slippery, corpulent warlord, but god knows America needed a stable oil-exporting ally in the region, and the Saudis were just about the only option.\n\nAfter the stilted pleasantries, the real discussion began, both sides trying to get as much as possible from their opponent while giving up as little as possible, the endless dance of diplomacy, negotiating and bargaining. Bruce was in his element. Determined to control himself, he gave the Saudis several minor concessions they wanted. It seemed to make them happy, but with the Saudis it was difficult to tell.\n\nFinally, after over an hour of dancing around it, the central point came up at last. Bruce's attempts to play nice with the Saudis had at least gotten his foot in the door, and now it was time to wedge the door open or forever give it up. As much as they pretended at supreme military dominance, Bruce knew the Saudi military was far from the juggernaut the King wished he had at his disposal. He could, of course, just play it cool, restore friendly relations and avoid further embarrassment... or, he considered, he could offer them the weapons agreement he knew they wanted. If a bunch of new toys couldn't mollify Faisal and get him to cooperate, Bruce reflected grimly, it was probable nothing would."

After a few minutes, the first in the line of brand-new American troop transports emblazoned with Saudi emblems came powering over the rise into the suburbs of Riyadh. Next would be the tanks, and the helicopters, and the cargo loads of guns, explosives, yadda yadda.\n\nHe drew the blinds and sat down. The King was signing the laws to put a leash on his overzealous police force and to allow a few token liberalizations in a closed ceremony in the Palace. It hadn't even made the news, which Bruce was sure wasn't an accident. Along with the seemingly endless materiel, the Saudis were getting millions more in aid and development funds siphoned by the Agency's oh-so-clever accountants in Washington.\n\nAs he listened to the trucks rumble past, Bruce blackly sipped his coffee. When he thought about it, the Saudis had gotten a hell of a lot more out of his agreement than he'd managed to get for America. He felt like a customer in a bazaar who thought he'd gotten a great bargain out of a haggle but had actually gotten swindled. He'd been warned Faisal was an infamous political operator, and yet somehow along the way Bruce had let him get the better of him. He supposed he'd had a chance to get the upper hand at some point, but he must have missed it. He almost had to admire them for it. Almost.\n\nFaisal and Khalid and the rest of them must be having a good laugh up at the Palace at having got one over on that degenerate heathen American. And yet, what could he possibly have done? America needed the Saudis on their side, for better or for worse. Anything as long as it kept the oil flowing.\n\nFinishing his coffee, Bruce sighed, and hoped it wouldn't be long until he could go home to the snowy plains of Minnesota, and never have to step foot in the desert again."

After a minute, he realized they weren't coming back.\n\nAs he was driven back to the embassy, Bruce sat in the back seat in the depths of a fell mood, his every muscle tensed. When he had offered a new weapons agreement to the King in exchange for token liberalizations and further cooperation from his government, the King had sneered, calling the United States weak and decadent. His ministers and the Crown Prince rising with him, King Faisal had declared that he would never compromise the deeply held beliefs and values of the Arabian people to appease America, especially not for what he deemed a "bribe". The King left sneering, cursing Americans as servants of Mammon.\n\nBruce was fuming. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was somehow personal, the King's retaliation for the harsh words they had exchanged in the garden. Could the man really be so vain that he would sacrifice such a one-sided deal for something so petty? Perhaps he had underestimated Faisal and his coterie.\n\nOf course, this didn't mark the end of America's association with the Saudis. They had become entangled into a frankly dangerous symbiotic relationship, the Saudis relying on America's military power and influence, and the Americans on Saudi oil. And here he was, Bruce Laingen of Butterfield, Minnesota, somehow caught up in the middle of it.\n\nGoddamn it all, he thought. All he could do now was try to satisfy Washington without rocking the boat too much. It was clear now that there would never be democracy in the Middle East if they were unwilling to give up their medieval practices. As long as the oil kept flowing Stateside, it would be enough.\n\nBruce leaned back into the richly upholstered leather, and dreamed of returning to the snowy fields of Minnesota."

Whether from rigs off the Louisiana coast or the bountiful wells in the Arabian Peninsula, cheap oil is the linchpin keeping the world's strongest economy strong from the bottom up.\n\nThen one sunny day in the turn of the decade, oil prices quadruple to $12 a barrel. And like an engine with neither lubricant nor fuel, the world's strongest economy sputters into a sudden stop. Pandemonium strikes Wall Street's floors as indexes dovetail past their troughs with no signs of slowing down, let alone stopping. Main Street fares little better: look only at the miles-long lines of cars outside gas stations across the country, both awaiting shipments of fuel that will never come. As conflagrations spark abroad, the crisis they have brought to America's shores have skyrocketed the prices of goods while simultaneously keeping people from earning money for them - in other words, a cataclysm poised to stunt, even reverse, a decade of growth.\n\nAmerica turns desperately to Capitol Hill for an answer to the world's first ever oil shock.

It would forever have avoided the pages of history, if it wasn't for one ill-fated patrol.\n\nAnd so, in the baking heat of the afternoon, they came. A group of American soldiers strode into Hamlet 773, guns out. It had been months since any Americans had come their way, and they all came out to see them.

He shouted at his troops, and they moved into the huts, ransacking them. As the elder approached the American to ask him to stop, the boy struck him to the ground. Lights swam behind the elder's eyes as he wiped the blood from his face. He could hear shouting, in Tswana and English. Looking through clouded eyes, he saw a group of women approach the boy, pointing at him and yelling. The elder tried to entreat them to calm, but the words died in his throat.\n\nEverything after that happened so suddenly. A girl ran from the group. She didn't get five paces before a shot rang through the air and she dropped like a ragdoll. The elder tried to rise, fell. Shots tore through the air above him. Silence.

They only glared and snarled in their pig-speech, and the boy felt his anger stoked at their contempt. Forward, he motioned, and the masked men approached with their strange machines, and the villagers watched them in confusion.\n\nWithout further warning, fire poured forth and the shacks went up in flames. Screaming, they began to flee, clutching babies and valuables, crashing to the ground as shots ripped through the air, tearing into their sunburned skin in fountains of blood.\n\nWithin minutes, the all-consuming fire had cleansed the village from the face of the earth.

The men of Tiger Force tied cables around his legs and attached them to the back of the APC, then took him on a spin through the grime of the battlefield, dragging him over the ruined bodies of his comrades, through the congealed gore. First he shouted, then he screamed, then he begged and cried and called for his Mutti, and finally he was silent.\n\nAt a sharp turn, his head was dashed against a rock, shattering his skull, his brain matter splattering across the mud. The Americans groaned, furious their fun had been interrupted, and, cutting the German's broken corpse loose, rolled away to look for more survivors."

He braced himself for what he knew was coming.\n\nNow that he had awoken, the torture began anew. One of the men punched him full force in the stomach and the chest, over and over again as the other watched, asking questions he didn't know the answers to. After a time, the torturer went to wash his hands clean while the Boer spat blood onto the concrete floor. It glistened in the harsh yellow glare of the sodium lights.\n\nNext came the pliers. He was determined not to scream, but his resolve broke immediately as the frowning torturer ripped out his thumbnail. The questioner continued in his monotonous drone, speaking the Afrikaans of one who had not been born to it. Where were they, how many were there, where were the supplies coming from. All the Boer could say was that he did not know, but they were not satisfied. After his remaining fingernails were lying on the floor in pools of blood, the torturer went to work on his teeth.\n\nAfter a time, the Boer awoke. He wondered how much time had passed in the dank, stinking cellar. The torturer wheeled a car battery forward and attached jumper cables to it, then clipped the clamps to his nipples. The Boer felt electricity light his brain up like a Christmas tree. For a moment the shock was so strong he didn't even feel the pain, but it came. Oh, it came. When he proved once again unable to answer their questions, the torturer swapped the clamps to his testicles.\n\nEventually, morning came. In an alley in Cape Town, down by the docks, a nondescript door opened. A young man with slicked-back red hair walked outside into the dim sunlight, rolling his shoulders and stretching his neck. Behind him, he awkwardly dragged a garbage bag, the contents sloshing around with every step. He heaved it into an already overflowing dumpster, and, shielding his eyes from morning's bright light, made his way back inside.\n\nSoon, they would be bringing in the next prisoner."

Tanks, helicopters and all kinds of weapons and explosives were littered across the continent in abandoned camps. Among this bounty, claimed by the Americans, was the Germans' invisible killer: poison gas.\n\nAs the men of Tiger Force advanced across the savannah, they ransacked many such camps, eventually coming into possession of a sizable stock of gas grenades, which they carried around with them, itching to find some krauts to use them on.\n\nIt was a regular patrol, to yet another of the half-empty hamlets that dotted the savannah. Their radio was on the fritz again, so as they milled around waiting for new orders, they decided to play a game: see how far away they could chuck a gas grenade into the village's well.\n\nA ruddy-faced corporal eventually managed it at ten paces. As the grenade clattered down into the well, they heard the pin get ripped out and the hiss of the gas filling the well as the grenade sunk into the water.\n\nAn old African approached them, yelling, repeating "Poison, poison!" over and over again. With a sneer the corporal shoved him to the dirt, his buddies laughing. Their laughter was cut short as more villagers came out of their huts, first curious to see what all the fuss was about, then furious. The elder stood, his nose bloodied, and began to shout at them. The other villagers were shouting too, closing in.\n\nWhen they stood before the panel at their disciplinary hearing, every man of Tiger Force said they didn't know who had fired the first shot, or who had thrown the poison grenade into the village's only source of water. Nevertheless, when the smoke had cleared, the ground was littered with shattered corpses. The few survivors were evacuated from their ancestral lands and, as the days went by, the plants and animals withered and died as the poison spread through the soil. It would be decades before life returned to the land.\n\nIf it ever did."

It is easy to deal death from a distance, never having to look into the enemy's eyes, hear them cry and scream and beg for mercy.\n\nThe bombs screamed downward, whistling through the air, but the pilot didn't hear them. Before their impact, there was a moment of peace that seemed to stretch for an eternity, where everything was locked where it was. Then the explosions blasted across the savannah, blowing apart the trucks in an eruption of twisted metal.\n\nSatisfied with a job well done, the pilot turned back to base. He would never see the villagers running to the shattered remains of the convoy, horrified to see their shipment of vital supplies obliterated, not a scrap remaining, and the road torn apart, their only lifeline to the outside world.\n\nHe would never see the children starving, the people dying of curable disease, the death and agony of their eventual migration away from their ancestral lands, desperate to survive.

Bombing runs from Südwestafrikaner pilots, eager to get revenge for the humiliation, quickly neutralized the scattered anti-aircraft batteries and proceeded to hammer the garrison with all kinds of payloads.

USA.saf.war.missions.6.desc:0 "In a sudden shift for a war that is already uncertain enough, Johanasburg has been retaken by the army of the Boer Republic. In the days before the offensive, American aerial reconnaissance had already shown a large concentration of Boer and German forces near the front, but few would have expected such a fierce counterattack: due in large part to supplies and advisors from the Afrika-Schild, the insurgents proved to be much more organized and effective than before, and achieved several key victories, forcing the front back to the city, where the occupation garrison had already bunkered in, supported by several volunteers from the African National Congress.\n\nDespite their fortifications and air support, the defenders couldn't resist the attack, supported by several battalions of superiorly-trained German troops, and gradually conceded more and more ground, before finally opting to fully withdraw from the city. While most of the soldiers managed to retreat in order, there weren't enough transports to take in the ANC partisans, who accused the Americans of having betrayed them. As they had nowhere to run, they decided to fight to the last man rather than surrendering: they fell one by one waging a fierce guerrilla against the advancing Boers, sabotaging several industrial facilities and dealing much heavier losses than they took, until they were completely vanquished.\n\nWith the liberation of Johanasburg, the Republic has regained control of its industrial core, and reparations are already underway to bring the military production plants to full efficiency. As the front moves once more towards the core lands of the South African Federation, many believe that the war is slowly turning in favour of the German coalition."

USA.saf.war.missions.7.t:0 "The Invasion of Libreville"
USA.saf.war.missions.7.desc:0 "Perhaps the Zentralafrikan High Command believed themselves too far from the frontline to be targeted by any real offensive, or perhaps they were simply too ill-prepared to actually do anything about it. The order of the addends doesn't change the result: in what comes as a surprise for most, and as a horrible nightmare for the Afrika-Schild, Libreville, the largest port of the westernmost Reichskommissariat, and the main source for their supplies from the mainland Reich and has fallen to American and South African marines.\n\nWith the cover of darkness, and supported by several naval units "borrowed" from the US Navy to their ally, the joint OFN task force launched a large naval invasion against this vital infrastructure. As the port itself was lightly defended, and most of the garrison had been sent to the front, there was little the remaining guards could do as hundreds of marines attacked in unison, and heavy naval batteries pounded what little defenses surrounded the docks.\n\nAlready, military engineers have started turning the city into a fortress with whatever they can find at hand, and the port facilities are being repaired for unknown purposes. As Zentralafrika hurries to defend its vulnerable belly, the American-led coalition has already achieved an important victory: by opening a second front directly in the heart of Deutsch-Afrika, they have managed to force their opponent to divert a significant contingent from the main front to the South, severely weakening their frontline. Should the Schild fail to retake Libreville, not only would the flow of supplies from the motherland abruptly end, but it would be the start of a devastating pincer move which could theoretically cause a general collapse of the German colonial alliance."

USA.saf.war.missions.8.desc:0 "To many, the capture of Libreville, and the opening of a second front deep inside Africa, had appeared as the last nail in the Schild's coffin, but the tides have turned once again in this strange, bloody war. It seems the concrete risk of total defeat awakened the German Reichskommissariate from their torpor: frantic call for arms were emitted, emergency reserves called into service, and the efficient German production plants, fuelled by the death throes of so many unfortunate souls, churned out an endless supply of weapons at the price of thousands more lives in a clean, mathematical proportion. Before the Americans could reinforce the disembarked naval garrison with proper ground troops, the full might of the German war machine was unleashed upon Libreville.\n\nSuddenly, he night was set ablaze by the simultaneous fire from dozens of explosions, and the few who were still asleep were forcibly torn from their dreams by the sounds of explosions and airplanes filling the sky. The marines held their ground and fought fiercely, supported by the constant barrage from the ships anchored at the docks, but they found themselves under attack by an enemy they couldn't hope to defeat: pioneers cleared the minefields and tank traps, while panzers rammed hastily-erected barricades and infantry quickly moved in to seize key points of the defensive line.\n\nThe defenders retreated in order to the port and quickly boarded their ships as they took the sea, thanks to the fact that the Germans carefully avoided bombing the port facilities; still not everyone could find place inside, and many fell in German hands. As the Afrika-Schild draws a collective breath of relief from the averted catastrophe, and the American government faces heavy criticism at home for the hundreds of soldiers dead or captured in what newspapers have called "the Bay of Fools", all contenders return their undivided attention to the main front. It seems the war will last longer than expected."

USA.saf.war.missions.9.desc:0 "The blow was heavy, and the dagger was plunged deep. After a startling string of defeats suffered by the Afrika-Schild, Leopoldville, the administrative center of Reichskommissariat, has fallen into the hands of the American-led coalition. This news comes as a welcomed development for the South Africans and their allies, as it now means that a second front has been successfully established deep inside Deutsch-Afrika, crippling the German war effort and dramatically sinking their morale.\n\nThe city, now bordering the Congo Lake, was poorly fortified, but had strong natural defenses in the form of quagmires and the ever-present jungle, which slowed down the attackers, and severely limited the use of artillery and air support. In the end, however, they weren't necessary: the hastily-erected defences fell after only a short battle as the mercenary garrison preferred to surrender in the face of the dramatic numerical superiority of the enemy. Now, they await to know their fate as it is unclear whether they are actual soldiers or "armed civilians".\n\nWith the fall of Leopoldville, Zentralafrika is on the brink of collapse, and the entire Schild hangs precariously in the balance: unless bold actions are taken, and victory follows, the war will be lost. Which is exactly what their opponents hope. Perhaps, the war is truly coming to an end this time"

USA.saf.war.missions.10.desc:0 "After the fall of Leopoldville, most thought the war would end in a matter of weeks, if not days, with the total collapse of the Afrika-Schild, but it seems they will remain disappointed. In a last, desperate move to cauterize the wound on the western front, the Oberkommando der Afrikanischen Streitkräfte mobilized all remaining forces for a desperate push: Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller himself returned from the southern front to lead the assault on his administrative center. Perhaps this was what spurred the German soldiers to fight even more fiercely than usual, or perhaps it was desperation, but in the end the result didn't change.\n\nThe American garrison fought in the jungles surrounding the city in a desperate attempt to hold back the enemy advance, but they were forced to retreat when the vegetation was set aflame by napalm bombings, and Zentralafrikaner helicopters hunted the scattered bands till the outskirts, where they were forced to retreat by the anti-aircraft batteries hurriedly mounted on the former central compound of the colonial administration. The symbolic value of the building didn't stop the Schild from heavily bombing it, further weakening the defenses before the final push. In the end, most of the garrison managed to leave the city before it fell by seizing several civilian boats and retreating through the lake towards their still-fighting comrades. Müller was reportedly "heartbroken" when he saw his most prized trophies used as "bedside tables and practice targets", and has sworn bitter revenge against those who perpetrated such a sacrilege.\n\nPerhaps this newfound rage will lead Zentralafrika towards a renewed impetus, but the situation remains extremely difficult for the German coalition: with large swathes of the Reichskommissariat still occupied, many doubt that the victory will do anything more than delaying the inevitable, especially with the western front still open like a festering wound. It will take much more than a postcard victory to revert the tides of battle."

USA.saf.war.missions.11.desc:0 "After a string of defeats suffered by the numerically inferior Ostafrikan colonial forces, today the easternmost African Reichskommissariat, and de facto leader of the Afrika-Schild, was forced to take an even worse humiliation, as American forces entered Quelimane, the colony's administrative center and seat of power of Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig.\n\nThe city had been turned into a veritable stronghold, with a ring of bunkers, trenches, minefields and underground tunnels covering the entire perimeter in a hellish maze of interlocking firing zones. What the garrison couldn't expect, however, was an enemy from the inside: though it's unknown whether they took contact with the besieging army, or if they acted on their own, partisan movements all throughout the city's many concentration camps and slave quarters launched a full-scale uprising, slaughtering their jailers and breaking free, spreading chaos and panic in the German quarters of the city. This distraction gave the attackers the perfect opportunity to strike and, despite taking heavy losses, they managed to dislodge the garrison from the outer bastions and enter the urban areas. The last sector to fall was the fortress-complex of the central administration compound, which had been riddled with boody-traps and death zones: over six hundreds soldiers died to take the building from the few dozens of fanatical German SS barricaded there, before military engineers and flamethrower teams were sent in.\n\nQuelimane was a vital hub for the colony, and hosted several industries fundamental to the war effort: the victorious occupants were reportedly "shocked" by what they saw in the countless mining concentration camps and slave factories, where tens of thousands of desperate men, women and children lived in abject poverty and starvation: many were moved to tears as some of the weakest ones died before their very eyes, crying of happiness for being free at last. Reichskommissar Hüttig managed to flee the city, and has sworn to avenge the defeat "with the lives of all Amerikaner in the city", but some doubt the factibility of such a claim."

USA.saf.war.missions.12.t:0 "The Rape of Quelimane"
USA.saf.war.missions.12.desc:0 "Everyone expected Hans Hüttig to try his best to keep faith to his promise of revenge. After all, he was known for his vengeful temper long before taking his office in the Dark Continent. What few predicted, however, was the extent of such single-minded will: the Reichskommissar immediately launched a furious counteroffensive, until the front fell back to the occupied Quelimane. What followed was one of the greatest tragedies to befall this bloodied land.\n\nAerial reconnaissance had showed only minimal troop movements near the city, and the garrison believed they could hold out in the hastily-repaired German defences: this belief soon turned hollow, as the attackers made use of an unmarked web of tunnels, known only to the highest officers, to secretly enter the city at night. Silently, like snakes stalking their prey with the cover of night, SS snipers surgically removed all sentinels and took position around the barracks, waiting for the signal: as soon as it arrived - a single artillery shot - the poisonous jaws closed, and slaughter began.\n\nThe defenders couldn't even take up arms as they were riddled with bullets in their beds, while the units secretly assembled in the forests surrounding the city moved in. No surrender terms were offered to the American commander: he and the few survivors were dragged from the central compound they had bunkered in, tortured for information, and summarily executed, the photos of their mangled corpses sent to the American command to show that Reichskommissar Hüttig always, ALWAYS keeps his promises. The worst, however, came after the victory, as all non-Germans within the city were declared "traitors to the Aryan race": the soldiers simply entered camps, tents, houses and began killing. With bullets. With bayonets. With flamethrowers The few who managed to escape told of SS covered from head to toe in human gore, rummaging through the bullet-ridden bodies of men, women and children to find the few still breathing and finish them with knives. This will surely have an impact upon the OFN coalition"

USA.saf.war.missions.13.t:0 "The Battle of Salisbury"
USA.saf.war.missions.13.desc:0 "Today, the war enters a new phase, as the front has definitely shifted in favor of the OFN coalition. Salisbury, the largest settlement of the former British colony of Rhodesia, now part of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, has fallen into the hands of the American-led coalition. The city was an important industrial center in the area, and home to the command staff for that sector, therefore its capture is an important success against the Afrika-Schild.\n\nThe city had been well-prepared for the siege, with strong defenses and large ammunition supplies, but in the end, the enemy was too strong. One by one, the bunkers were busted by surgical artillery and aerial strikes and tanks moved in to seize the entrenched defenders still fighting. Slowly, the garrison fell inwards to pre-prepared positions, but they found many of them sabotaged or occupied by partisan who had been waiting for the right moment to strike: many German soldiers were felled by surprise bursts of their own HMG, and the rest were crushed between the anvil and the hammer as the South African infantry launched the final offensive.\n\nReichskommissar Hans Hüttig is reportedly "disappointed" by the failure to defend the city, and has issued a conscription order to mobilize additional forces and retake the city as soon as possible. He also threatened the occupying forces to abandon the city immediately, "or suffer the consequences of their hybris". Despite his boisterous claim, all observers agree that this is an important victory for the OFN."

USA.saf.war.missions.14.t:0 "The Second Battle of Salisbury"
USA.saf.war.missions.14.desc:0 "One of the reasons many fear Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig is that he remembers everything. Every slight, every insult, every defeat, every humiliation: he stores them inside, and waits for the moment he can enact his revenge. When Salisbury first fell in the hands of the joint American-South African force, he swore that they would pay for their insolence: now, it seems he has come to collect his debt as the last offensive managed to push deep enough to retake the city.\n\nSalisbury had been prepared for the assault, with new fortifications built in place of the demolished German ones, but it proved no match for the intense incendiary and bunker-busting bombings which targeted the defenses for days. When the Schild launched a full-scale offensive, few were still capable of fighting, and even retreating to more defensible positions in the center proved useless, but when the garrison commander finally surrendered, he was shocked to hear the terms. With the only other alternative being mass execution, they were requested to enact decimation: one every ten soldiers would be selected by chance under German surveillance, and killed by his own comrades. The entire process, intended to break enemy morale, was described in detail by a few prisoners liberated on purpose and allowed to return to their units.\n\nThe American high command was shocked by the news, but even more shocking was the tale of what the native population was subjected to: hundreds of suspected partisans, along with even more slaves who had "dared" to leave their camps and go live in houses left empty by evacuated German families, were summarily executed by firing squads, their corpses thrown into mass graves. It seems that the war will last more than expected, and it will reach an even higher degree of brutality"

USA.saf.war.missions.15.desc:0 "Despite the increasing involvement of the United States, it seems the scales are tipping in German favor. Today, the Afrika-Schild managed to fully occupy the city of East London: after a string of defeats suffered by the OFN coalition in the East, the Boer insurgent army, supported by several elements of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, had pushed the frontline far enough to threaten the core of the South African Federation. Despite losing its status of an economic center due to the years of apartheid, which saw most of its white population leaving for greener pastures, the city was still an important logistical junction, allowing supplies from Cape Town and the increasingly frequent American shipments to directly reach the eastern front.\n\nThe city had been heavily fortified for the coming assault, with several artillery and anti-aircraft emplacements scattered in the many squares and parks dotting the city, while the outskirts had been torn down and replaced with interlocking bunkers, trenches and minefields. Still, this wasn't enough to hold off the attackers, as the joint German-Boer task forces used napalm and heavy artillery to clear the outer defenses, creating a breach large enough for the close quarters specialists to reach their intended targets. The garrison fought back valiantly, with important support from those civilians who preferred to fight and die rather than live in slavery, but in the end they were forced to concede more and more ground, until a last defensive line was hurriedly formed around the harbour: all possible supplies were loaded on any availabe ship to not let it fall in German hand, but many were left behind and had to surrender and face the war prisoners' camps.\n\nThe American commander in South Africa has vowed to "free the people from the national socialist yoke", and already rumors are starting to circulate about heavier investments in the war, but this defeat is drawing heavy criticism for how the American expedition was ill-prepared for this conflict, and many doubt that the tides of war will change.

USA.saf.war.missions.16.t:0 "The Recapture of East London"
USA.saf.war.missions.16.desc:0 "Perhaps the fall of East London finally let the South Africans and their American allies understand the seriousness of the situation. They say that, in desperate times, people do extraordinary things, and this proved true once more, as a full-scale counterattack, ordered by the joint General Staff of the coalition, managed to liberate the city after a hard-fought battle: the arrival of new reinforcements from the United States proved instrumental in retaking the city, showing once more how invested they are in the war, something which drew diplomatic protests from the mainland Reich.\n\nThe Germans had bunkered in the city, erecting makeshift fortifications and turning the outskirts into a death zone with booby-traps and minefields: uncaring for the civilian population, they had torn down several blocks to have clear firing lines and dig trenches. In the end, however, this wasn't enough, and the heavy bombardments destroyed most outer defenses, forcing the garrison to fall back to the opposite end of the city, where they had already prepared for the retreat. Under the cover of darkness, most of the Germans and high-ranking Boer officers abandoned the city, leaving behind only a token force to delude their enemies into thinking they were still fighting. The ruse was discovered only the next day, when the Americans attacked and found almost no resistance.\n\nEven though the victory was less of a triumph than hoped for, this still comes as a success for the OFN coalition after a long time without any meaningful success. While it is clear in Washington that the war will still drag on, at least total defeat is no longer a likely outcome, which is already a result."

USA.saf.war.missions.17.desc:0 "Today, a devastating blow has been struck against South Africa as Cape Town, the Federation's capital and largest city, fell to a joint task force of Boer and Südwestafrikaner soldiers. The last weeks had seen the American-led coalition suffer defeat after defeat, losing several key settlements to the Afrika-Schild, until the front reached the very heart of the country. Now, that heart has stopped beating.\n\nThe hills surrounding the "City Bowl" were turned into fortresses linked by trench lines, fully enclosing the Cape in a ring of heavy fortifications. The city itself had extensively prepared for the coming attack, with barricades and key locations garrisoned by volunteer units, and American artillery and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the roads and squares. However, even such preparations weren't enough to resist as the entirety of the German war machine was thrown at the defenders. Boer artillery, supplied by their German allies, surgically removed a large part of the air defenses, and then Südwestafrikaner bombers unleashed hell upon the city in the form of incendiary bombings and bunker-busting payloads. Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles were riddled with craters, while Signal Hill was captured and turned into an advanced artillery position to fire directly into the inner urban areas. In the end, the pressure became too much, and the joint High Command ordered a full retreat from the city by sea.\n\nWith the fall of its capital, South Africa loses also its largest industrial center and recruitment pool, severely crippling the war effort. In Washington, the American government is currently under attack by several newspapers and prominent opposition politicians, who decry the "useless sacrifice of American lives" and ask for total disengagement from this "humiliating disaster". Meanwhile, as the ashes cool down, the new Boer military administration, helped by German personnel, has already started implementing apartheid.

In what came as a sudden change to the one-sided course of the war, the last reserves of the Federal army, heavily supported by elements of the American Navy and driven by determination bordering on desperation, launched a full-scale offensive against their capital.\n\nThe new occupants of the city hadn't had the time to repair the fortifications surrounding the city, and were forced to fight in ruined bunkers and half-buried trenches. At the same time, a general uprising from the population, who hadn't been taking well the newly imposed apartheid, forced the Boer command to divert several units from key locations around the ring of forts, further weakening the already too strained defenses and finally forcing a geneal retreat from the hills. With the defenders surrounded from all sides, the officer in command finally surrendered in the morning: the coalition troops entered a wounded, but jubilant city, while their enemies hurried to reach their captors before they could be lynched by the enraged mob.\n\nThis victory comes as an utterly unexpected development in a war that already defies all known parameters: the German war machine has suffered a strong blow, and the industries of Cape Town will be a boon for the South African army as soon as they are repaired, returning a modicum of autonomy to an army which now completely depends on American supplies.

Everyone knows many of them won't return, and this has caused widespread protests as many fear their loved ones will be among the victims: spontaneous marches and picket lines can be already seen in large cities, but the harshest backlash has come from the drafted themselves.\n\nRather than showing what [USA.GetLeader] has called "proud American spirit", thousands of college students and other young men have filled the streets, openly burning their draft cards and loudly protesting against an administration that, in their opinion, has "destroyed their dreams and replaced them with war". Of course, the opposition has immediately offered support to the protesters, promising their potential voters that their first concern will be the end of this "illiberal and useless measure", which they claim "receives the backing of profiteers and kleptocrats".\n\nSlowly, painfully, the police is restoring control, and the draft has resumed when it became clear that all those who refused to present themselves to the barracks will spend enough time in prison to completely forget about college. Still, it has appeared clear that the escalation of the war is seen with hostility and dissatisfaction by the general population of America, something which should drive the President towards a quick and victorious conclusion of this bloody conflict."

He's studied the examples of our allies and enemies alike, across four continents, and he's published a number of impressive internal memos about the present situation in the Middle East. Someone like him would be invaluable on the ground during the present crisis, especially to help train and guide the freedom fighters of the Arab world. However, we're in a bit of a bind. There are a number of high-priority conflicts currently raging in the Middle East, and only one Colonel Schwarzkopf. Some in the Pentagon have proposed that he lead a small mission to the Baathist fighters in Egypt, to aid in their struggle against the Saudi-backed theocrats and Italian Empire alike. Having a friend near the Suez Canal wouldn't be a bad idea. At the same time, his efforts could also bear fruit in Syria's current independence struggle, especially with the country's oil fields and strategic location.

Minarets and clock towers pierced the skyline, gardens bloomed among its marble ruins, and giant metal water wheels still turned with the river's flow. But Hama was also at war. Flying in low over the Ghab Plain, the pilots could see all the signs. Gun emplacements, burned farms, bombed-out villages who'd had the rotten luck to meet the Turkish Army on a bad day. Or maybe it had been the Baathists who'd done that. "Doesn't matter either way," thought the copilot. He'd seen the same stuff in Namibia.\n\nFinally, the plane touched down at Hama Airbase. The airstrip was little more than packed dirt, and one of the three steel hangars had been demolished by artillery. Out on the "tarmac", the general was waiting.

It wasn't a true backwater, and to villagers throughout the governorate, it was still "el-madina", but most residents could feel the malaise in the air.\n\nNobody aboard the unmarked Learjet, cutting through the chilly night, knew about this. As it touched down on the makeshift airstrip, set up on the other side of the Nile from Beni Suef, a cadre of Baathist officers stood at attention. A small group of American soldiers hustled down the airstair, followed by the man of the hour. Deep-set eyes, a vast American chin, and a colonel's eagle on his uniform.

Nearly two centuries ago, a young Frenchman named Gilbert du Motier sailed to America, to help liberate our young nation. Colonel Schwarzkopf, one might say, is our answer to his legacy."
USA_Assess_Their_Politics_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second. Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open. Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations. For the most part, this is acceptable. There is a war to be won, after all, and not all niceties can be preserved. At the same time, though, we are the Organization of FREE Nations. Moreover, our arms shipments and diplomatic cover are in large part responsible for the survival of these forces. We can certainly stand to assess the internal politics of our allies, and try and push them towards a more pluralistic form of government. Why else are we here, if not to push freedom's power ever further?"
USA_Just_Like_Nambia_desc:0 "The South African War was fought on many fronts, from the marshes of the Limpopo to the mountains of the Manica, but one of the most infamous was certainly the deserts of southerwestern Africa. Amid the sands of the Namib, the Moçâmedes, and the Kalahari, American officers learned many lessons about desert warfare. Now, with our new intervention in the Middle East, we have the opportunity to put those lessons to good use. New "advisor" units, veterans of South Africa all, can integrate near-seamlessly into the forces of our Middle Eastern allies. With the knowledge of battles past, we can reap new victories in the fights to come."
USA_Spread_The_Cash_desc:0 "Money is a very effective tool. It can garner influence, fame, and resources, almost without limit. And, fortunately, the United States has plenty of money to move around. Our extensive discretionary cash reserves can be used to purchase loyalties across the Middle East, along with the services of armed contractors from further afield. In the grand scheme of things, it's fairly cheap, with the potential for major benefits. The efforts of these soldiers of fortune could go a long way towards achieving victory for our allies."
USA_Merchants_of_Death_desc:0 "Diplomatic support is a welcome boost for our allies. Money, advisors, and even foreign mercenaries are even more welcome. But at the end of the day, wars are won with firepower, and while our hands are officially tied by the bonds of congressional oversight, the CIA has a wealth of experience with ensuring that guns get where they're needed. Embargo, emshmargo. Our allies will get all the weaponry and ammunition they need, and both the Arabs and our own geopolitical position will benefit. And if some of those guns help to secure oil fields, well, so much the better."
USA_Across_The_Burning_Sands_desc:0 "America's presence in the Middle East has certainly ramped up over the past several months, but by comparison to the Italians and Saudis, it's still fairly paltry. That must change. We must send new, large-scale contingents of "military advisors" to support our allies in their fights against fascism and Islamism. On the ground, our firepower, tactics, and good old-fashioned American tenacity will surely demolish the enemy proxies. Our intervention will be felt from Riyadh to Rome, and beyond. There is a strong will for democracy in the Arab world, and America will ensure its security, by any means necessary."
USA_Smother_the_Flames_desc:0 "Collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might present itself as a lucrative option, but it is one with the potential for unknown blowback and unforeseen consequences. Instead, we should exercise our own influence in the Middle East, disrupting the Italians and standing against the Saudis. To do this, we should work on winning hearts, minds, and wallets across the region. Independence movements will be supported, victimized populations will be assisted, and new, strong, and free nations will be supported in the Arab world. Their prosperity, and their stability, will be our gain."
USA_Stabilize_the_Situation_desc:0 "Our allies in the Arab world need all the help that we can provide. That much is certain. However, the niceties of congressional oversight and the proclivities of public opinion make any offer of direct military aid all but impossible. That doesn't mean that we can't assist them, though. Shipments of non-lethal equipment such as binoculars, camouflage, vehicles, and body armor should be one of our top priorities. In addition, food and medical supplies can benefit both our allies' forces on the ground AND the civilians who have been put in harm's way by the fighting. Such efforts will communicate our commitments in the Middle East, while also earning some positive news coverage. After all, we're sending them butter, not guns. Who could have a problem with that?"
USA_Operation_Desert_Shield_desc:0 "Throughout the bloody wars that have torn the Middle East apart, one constant has been the use of air power by outside powers, seeking to bolster their proxies in the Arab world. Such air power has given them an advantage, but it's also had disastrous consequences for civilians on the ground. No longer. Using aircraft carriers stationed in the Indian Ocean, we can declare a series of no-fly zones over conflict areas. It will certainly be a slap in the face to powers like Italy, who have enjoyed years of uninterrupted hegemony in Arab skies, but countless lives will be saved, and American prestige will surely be bolstered."
USA_Help_The_Refugees_desc:0 "From Syria to Yemen to Egypt, and beyond, tens of thousands of civilians have been forced from their homes. Whether it's from the countryside to cities, from province to province, or from country to country, there are massive populations of displaced innocents who are in desperate need of assistance. The United States is in an excellent position to provide that assistance. Our freighters and transport planes can be tasked to send civilian medical teams, food aid, and even creature comforts to the refugee camps that are springing up across the region. It's the right thing to do, and more importantly, it will produce a tsunami of positive PR for our involvement in the Middle East."
USA_Guns_For_Democracy_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second. Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open. Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations. We can do better. Our unique position, as their primary source of supplies and diplomatic backing, gives us a great deal of leverage. We can hold the carrot of renewed aid, in return for liberalization of governance and accountability for abuses by military forces. It wouldn't need to be substantial, as long as it was public. If not, there's always the threat of being left out in the cold. That would be the stick."
USA_The_Desert_Scouts_desc:0 "The violence that the people of the Arab world have been facing as of late is intolerable. While our air interdiction efforts and humanitarian aid have certainly born fruit, we need to work further to stabilize the Middle East. One new proposal is to use American helicopters as a way to patrol far inland, when regular airpower would be imprecise or insufficient. Helicopters are generally much more versatile, and can be used to transport everything from medicine to information to tactical units. Such a "desert scout" program would initially consist mainly of American "blue suits", but with a bit of time, we can train our allies to fly as well. These patrols would undoubtedly yield excellent results on the ground."
USA_The_Hand_of_Kindness_desc:0 "War is hell, and war is destructive. While many states in the Middle East had already been struggling with developing modern infrastructure commensurate to their roles in the global economy, these recent wars have only made the issue worse. This is an issue that we can address. American investment, materiel, and engineering expertise can pave new highways, build new bridges, and upgrade rail lines in territories controlled by our allies. This will improve our ties, but in a region gripped by war, such programs would also provide a measure of stability."
USA_Sending_Them_Experts_desc:0 "Another one of war's casualties, too often, is knowledge. The Middle East has experienced a continual brain drain over the past several decades, as fascist colonialism and destabilizing wars have ruined the academic talent pools of the Arab world. By offering new scholarships to students from allied nations, and investing in research institutions, we can help ensure that the lands which gave us the House of Wisdom retain their intellectual strength. To secure the future, we must teach the present."
USA_A_More_Direct_Approach_desc:0 "At the end of the day, America is involved in the Middle East. Our officers help train forces in Egypt, our cargo planes supply refugees in Syria, and our cruise missiles protect the cities and towns of Yemen. We cannot ignore it, and as these wars against fascism and Wahabism continue to exact a bloody toll on the Arab world, it is clear that placing some boots on the ground is necessary. It will likely result in some protest at home, in the papers and in the streets of Washington, but America's regional interests are on the line, and American prestige must be preserved.\n\nJust so long as we can devise an exit strategy."

Entire city blocks have been set alight by rioters, raging against a system that has bound them for the part of four centuries. Police and National Guardsmen mount desperate rearguard actions. Meanwhile, Americans of all stripes watch their television screens with undisguised anxiety. The assassination of Martin Luther King has set off a vast chain reaction of fury, grief, and destruction, and nobody is quite sure where it will end."

South Africa's fires rage heedless of the man in the White House, burning Nazis, civilians and, more pressingly, American soldiers alike. The American people have elected President [Root.GetLeader] in large part to bring them home posthaste.\n\nCongress has split into two sides over when to pull our boys out of the Veld. The "Interventionists", led by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, argue that bringing more of them for large-scale offensives will finally break the Schild's back and end the war soon. Chairman of House Foreign Relations Donald Rumsfeld and his "Technocrats" advocate leaving only our best behind with better leadership, doctrines, weapons systems and intelligence instead of risking a gruesome war of attrition.\n\nWhoseever advise the President listens to shall become America's strategy going forward. Thousands of families, both of servicemen and of potential draftees, pray he decides rightly."

People have to feel safe in their homes and communities, or else all trust in this coalition will collapse. Thus, the Pentagon has proposed the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support Program, aka CORDS. By assigning training personnel and funding to local communities, we can build up local security forces. This will give us additional cachet on the ground, and additional manpower to help combat a variety of insurgents. Civilians that feel secure and in control of their local environments will be better allies, and CORDS can help to make that happen."

These are vicious guerillas who strike when least expected, and sow chaos both behind and at the front lines. Werewolf activity is devastating for morale, and we need to get a handle on it immediately. The brass is proposing the Phoenix Program as a solution. This program would involve forming joint counterinsurgency units to go into potentially hostile areas and eliminate Werewolf activity, by any means necessary. Order has to be restored, and the Werewolves need to be knocked out once and for all."

Or worse, brother Tommy hosing down POWs in a fit of rage.\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] has thus directed the Signal Corps to tone down the news filtering back into the States a little - say, that morale is high, casualties are low, and the war's ending soon.

Bastard he may be, but the ex-President did all he could to keep the organization together through its greatest trial yet.\n\nBy doing so, however, he had pushed the onus of dealing with the inevitable grumblings onto us. These grumblings have only grown as the war drags on.

We will give it to them." When further inquired of the steps needed to save South Africa, his proposal was anything but.\n\nFounts of tabulated data, calculated extrapolations, and above all cold, hard numbers flowed freely from Ford's brightest Whiz Kid. The erudition he demonstrated had rooted logic into the war's vagueries and made them answerable with actionable solutions - "...the most effective among them," he concluded, "being an escalation of our presence by several orders of magnitude than current. The costs are high, but their countervailing benefits are incalculable."\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] was swayed by McNamara's concise arguments and clear-sighted goals, and shall take his advice into firm account henceforth."

What were once guarantors of the country's warmaking assets have now taken a new primary role as the guarantors of many a politician's careers, and their districts' allegiances to boot. Said politicians return the favor by inflating our budget every fiscal year or so, letting Boeing, McDonnell and North American gorge themselves fat on the excess - like spiders having their fill of succulent flies.\n\nNevertheless, these spiders bear sharp fangs and potent poison. Their weapons of trade can be put to better use paralyzing the Nazis' industries and supply lines instead of bogging ours to near-uselessness. Subsidizing new factories for America's military-industrial web, especially in swing districts, will allow us to benefit from both of the two heads it now sprouts."

If it had a name, the report had an exact number and unit on mention.\n\nMcNamara didn't just put numbers into Nixon's war; he had turned death into variables a man can add and subtract, multiply and divide. As expected of Ford's brightest Whiz Kid, in hindsight. Perhaps he viewed the conflict as a car plant with faults to solve, and the men involved no different from spare parts on a manager's requisition list. That would at least explain the data charts taking up near-half this mammoth of a document. But did the President himself?\n\nFrowning, he turned towards the Secretary.

Thousands of them. It's not just longhaired college students and draft-dodgers, either. Respectable-looking, middle class types are in the crowd, and they're as angry as the unwashed sophomores from Columbia. The DC police and Secret Service might be able to keep them from storming the gates, but they can't keep the crowds of anti-war protesters from raising hell in the streets of Washington. And they won't. Stop. Chanting.\n\nDeep down, the President can't blame them. When he announced the troop surge, and the new aid package for Cape Town, he knew that people would see it as a betrayal. As the ultimate broken promise to the people of America. It sure as hell doesn't look like peace is right around the corner. But this is the only way.\n\nIf only he could make the people see that."

Two couches dominated the center of the room, angling orthogonally from the Desk like the wings of an amphitheater. On one, Vice President LeMay and Margaret Chase Smith sat, representing the NPP's far right. On the other sat Hubert Humphrey and Michael Harrington, scions of the party center.\n\n"Mr. President," LeMay started. "We need to finish this war, and it can only be finished with the capabilities of the United States military. It'll be bloody, but it'll be faster than the current status quo could achieve." Smith nodded silently. LeMay was her dog in this fight, and his military credentials were certainly useful. But not everyone was in assent.\n\n"You're proposing that we burn Africa." Humphrey was quiet, but his eyes glowed like coals.\n\n"Well, Hubert, we need to honestly ass-"\n\n"No, Mr. Vice President. Our party would revolt. The COUNTRY would revolt.

#Indonesia CW Focus Tree Descriptions
 USA_RD_burning_jungle_desc:0 "Indonesia is aflame, what is the situation?"
 USA_RD_pick_up_red_phone_desc:0 "Given that both of us are nuclear powers, it stands to reason that we must tread carefully when interfering with the Co-Prosperity Sphere. While Japan seems to be controlled by level-headed men, we must still be careful to toe the fine line between isolationism and being mavericks.\n\nWe will place a call to the Japanese on the red telephone. We will assure them that we have no interest in sending Japanese boys home with American bullets in them. Yet, our commitment to democratic movements around the world brings upon us a moral obligation to support those who fight for freedom in Indonesia. Reminding them of Indonesia's technical independence and sovereignty, we will caution them against launching an intervention into the East Indies and remind them that threatening the freedom of a sovereign people may have dire consequences."
 USA_RD_pick_up_red_phone_effect:0 "§OBy taking this focus, America will begin its involvement in Indonesia, and will face consiquences depending on how this conflict will end§!\n"
 USA_RD_work_the_backchannels_desc:0 "Open armament of Free Indonesia may be a bridge too far for the moment. Nonetheless, equipment has often found its way into the stockpiles of rebel movements throughout the world. If American equipment were to find itself in Hatta's hands, well, that would surely be just a coincidence...\n\nWe shall open back-channels of communication and transport between Hatta and the United States. We shall ensure Hatta gets his hands on some premium American equipment. Hopefully, this will help turn the tide in the Indonesian war."
 USA_RD_secure_supply_lines_desc:0 "Every army travels on its stomach, and Hatta's is no different. His men need food, his trucks need fuel, and his guns need cartridges. America will gladly provide all of these.\n\nWe will use our positions in the Pacific, particularly Australia, to secure supply lines to the liberated zones of Indonesia. With our help, Hatta's men will want for nothing. We can only hope Japan is less generous to Sukarno than we are to Hatta."
 USA_RD_south_africa_lessons_desc:0 "The conflict in South Africa taught us much about asymmetrical warfare in the late 20th century. Our troops are battle-hardened, and our attaches may have useful insights to offer Hatta's freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send US Army Rangers to teach the Free Indonesians entrenchment tactics to improve their defensive capabilities against Sukarno. We will also teach them logistical techniques that will improve their mobility and ability to stay organized while on the march."
 USA_RD_send_advisers_desc:0 "The war has dragged on longer than we hoped, and we have no choice now but to escalate. Where once, we merely assisted Hatta's army, now it's time to fight alongside them.\n\nWe will send a full division of US troops to Indonesia in an "advisory" role. While these will merely be volunteers, they will be fighting in the thick of it defending the Indonesians on their left and right. This move will allow us to take a more direct role in the Indonesian war effort."
 USA_RD_hidden_hand_desc:0 "Our "advisors" have been making excellent progress in the Indonesian war effort, yet Sukarno's henchmen have proven rather intractable. Perhaps it is time to use our new forward base and naval routes to enlarge our commitment in Indonesia.\n\nAnother division of "advisors" will be deployed to aid Hatta. This will still be done under the guise of volunteer assistance of the Free Indonesian administration, that our "hidden hand" in the conflict may continue to be obscured."
 USA_RD_war_of_words_desc:0 "As the Indonesian conflict unfolds, it is critical that we control the conversation surrounding it. While the American everyman might not have much of a reason to care about Indonesia, by framing the situation as a struggle against our Japanese enemy, we might win their hearts and minds.\n\nWe will hit the airwaves and ensure that the world and our own people both know the righteousness of Hatta's cause. This will induce our people at home to sympathize with the Indonesian struggle for freedom, as well as assure the Free Indonesians that we have their back."
 USA_RD_united_we_stand_desc:0 "The Indonesian War is not a vanity project for the US alone, but a cause the whole OFN can get behind. We can't shoulder the burden of aiding Hatta alone, it's time for the OFN to contribute to the liberation of Indonesia.\n\nWe will call in support from the OFN. Not volunteers, that's a bridge too far, but we will secure substantial equipment donations from our member states. Hatta's men will be armed with weapons from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. This will hopefully greatly aid their independence struggle."
 USA_RD_expand_the_fleet_desc:0 "In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay and forced the Japanese to end centuries of isolation from the world. He accomplished this by having a massive armada of the finest warships sailing behind him. Naval intimidation of the Japanese worked once, we pray it shall work again.\n\nWe will start insisting on double shifts at our dockyards. Fleet production will ramp up considerably so that our ships may be commissioned more quickly. Hopefully, we'll be able to spook the Japanese with our resurgent Navy."
 USA_RD_force_their_hand_desc:0 "The Japanese control the Indonesian skies. Sukarno's men fly above and rain hell on Hatta's men below. The Sphere's aerial dominance is unquestioned.\n\nPerhaps it's time to question it.\n\nWe will send fighter jets and CAS equipment to Hatta. He will now be able to boast a powerful air squadron to challenge Japanese air superiority. Of course, this may tip Japan over the edge..."
 USA_RD_arms_production_desc:0 "The Indonesian conflict is more demanding than we realized. Our existing military factory output is insufficient to meet the needs of Hatta's men, as Sukarno has dug in more deeply than we expected.\n\nBut that's easy to solve.\n\nWe will send over engineers to Free Indonesia to construct a major military production complex as swiftly as possible. This will be a small boost to the Free Indonesian arms output, but hopefully enough to turn the tide against Sukarno. "
 USA_RD_forward_base_darwin_desc:0 "Australia is our closest ally to the Indonesians. The Northern tip of the country has one quite populous city, Darwin. This area could serve as an important launch point for any actions taken in the South Pacific.\n\nWe will offer to construct vast fortification networks in Northern Australia in order to brace for the conflict coming to their shores. These bases will also be excellent points from which to deploy troops to Indonesia."
 USA_RD_emergency_naval_training_desc:0 "I don't know if you've ever looked at a map, but there is no land route from the United States to Indonesia. Consequently, the Navy will be essential for any operations to assist Hatta, and it is all too important that the Navy be ready to carry them out.\n\nWe will launch emergency naval exercises to prepare our seamen for Indonesian operations. This may allow us to better update our naval warfare doctrines should we come into any conflict on the open seas. Hopefully the Japanese aren't foolish enough to let things get to that point, but we must nevertheless be prepared."
 USA_RD_ready_the_airforce_desc:0 "Our airmen are eager to deploy into Indonesia, but they need a base to deploy from first. Darwin has already been fortified for defense, but now it must be equipped for aerial operations.\n\nWe will send engineers to Australia to hastily construct air bases that are large enough for sizable air deployments. Their proximity to Indonesia shall allow us to aid Hatta's men from above, and deploy more squadrons than ever before."

 USA_NPP_ready_the_australians_desc:0 "Nixon, coward that he was, envisioned a policy of "containment" of Japanese imperialism. He would have used Australia as a forward operating base for US troops to provide an assistance role to Hatta. But we in the NPP know that the Organization of Free Nations ain't free. The Aussies ain't here to be a mere base of operations, they're going into the breach by our side.\n\nWe will put a call to the Aussies and tell them to ready their men for intervention in Indonesia. We'll get them fired up and ready to run through the jungle. We'll also send them some equipment too, in case they need it."
 USA_NPP_mandatory_naval_training_desc:0 "The purpose of the US Navy isn't just to move troops from point A to point B. It's not just a series of carriers for our planes. No, the Navy is a powerful tool in our diplomatic arsenal. It's the cannon that will fire the Marine Corps at Sukarno and keep the Japanese at arm's length.\n\nWe will conduct emergency Naval exercises to prepare the USN to starve Sukarno. Not only that, we will prepare our ships to deploy our forces on a moment's notice. Sukarno has no idea what he's in for, and the IJN would be well advised to stay out of the South Pacific while we operate..."
 USA_NPP_begin_the_blockade_desc:0 "The American people will not accept another South Africa. They do not want a long, protracted conflict that leads to horrible images on TV. They need not worry, we'll make sure Sukarno doesn't last long enough for us to get sick of fighting him. It's time to starve the beast.\n\nWe will cut Japan off from Indonesia. The USN will surround the East Indies, securing our supply lines and crippling Sukarno's. Our training will go a long way to making our Navy able to win the new Pacific conflict. Our Navy will be on high alert to stop any and all threats to Hatta's liberation struggle."
 USA_NPP_airforce_indonesia_desc:0 "Our naval supremacy in the East Indies has been entrenched through the blockade, but our air supremacy has yet to be established.\n\nYet.\n\nThe USAF will now begin emergency drills in preparation for the East Indies conflict. While on high alert, they will be far more effective at controlling the skies and aiding Hatta's ground troops."
 USA_NPP_south_africa_lessons_desc:0 "The conflict in South Africa taught us much about asymmetrical warfare in the late 20th century. Our troops are battle-hardened, and our attaches may have useful insights to offer Hatta's freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send US Army Rangers to teach the Free Indonesians entrenchment tactics to improve their defensive capabilities against Sukarno. We will also teach them logistical techniques that will improve their mobility and ability to stay organized while on the march."
 USA_NPP_send_over_the_planes_desc:0 "We cannot control the skies alone. Our pilots are still only flying in a volunteer role. This proxy war cannot be one solely through the limited direct involvement Congress permits us, we will have to get Hatta's men up in the air alongside our own.\n\nWe will send fighter jets and CAS equipment to Hatta. He will now be able to boast a powerful air squadron to challenge Japanese air superiority. Of course, this may tip Japan over the edge, but they should have known better than to resist the march of democracy."
 USA_NPP_maximum_pressure_desc:0 "Indonesia's freedom is non-negotiable. There will be no détentes, no olive branches, no treaties. Either we seize the day and cut off Japan's main source of oil now, or we never will.\n\nTime to turn up the heat on Tokyo. We will hit them with a diplomatic onslaught. They will be made to know, in no uncertain terms, that we are in this to win this. Hopefully they will back down."
 USA_NPP_propaganda_leaflets_desc:0 "Hatta's men are well armed, at this point, yet not as motivated as we would like. We must win over the hearts and minds of the Indonesians, show them that now is the hour of their liberation....if only they rise up and claim it.\n\nWe will begin an intensive propaganda campaign across Indonesia. This will inspire more recruits to the Free Indonesian cause as well as improve the fighting spirit of Hatta's troops."
 USA_NPP_block_the_japanese_desc:0 "The IJN is massive in comparison to the USN. Even though we are better trained and suffer none of the interservice rivalry issues that plague Japan, we still are unable to match them pound for pound in naval output. Let's fix that.\n\nWe will immediately invest into our dockyards to rapidly construct new naval vessels. Hopefully, the increased output will allow us to finish ships we've currently queued up. This will enable our navy to more effectively uphold the Blockade and block the Japanese."
 USA_NPP_fan_the_fire_desc:0 "Our factories just keep churning out more and more guns. What good are they doing sitting in a warehouse stateside? Our troops back home have no one to shoot, but Hatta's men do! Let's give em something to shoot with.\n\nWe will send yet more guns to Hatta. Japan may not like this, but there's too much at stake in the Indonesian conflict for us not to fan the fires of war."
 USA_NPP_fan_the_fire_effect:0 "§OWe will equip some new Indonesian divisions§!\n"
 USA_NPP_freedom_fighters_desc:0 "Since we imposed the blockade, Hatta's factories have lacked for nothing. As our supplies continue pouring in, we should strike while the iron is hot and redouble our aid efforts to the Indonesian freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send over the material necessary to improve the construction output in the liberated zones. The jobs created by our expanded efforts should please folks on the home front, too."
 USA_NPP_everything_must_go_desc:0 ""Come on and get your guns! Help yourselves! Be my guest! No charge! Free samples! Guns guns guns! Once in a lifetime giveaway! Everything must go! We have grenades, take a whole crate! Do you want artillery? Well we got artillery! Do you want jeeps? Well if you fight for Hatta, you can have the whole motor pool! Don't forget your bullets! Everything goes for free!""
 USA_NPP_patriot_division_desc:0 "The namby-pamby R-Ds would exercise more "caution" before doing this, but we don't have the same constraints as the establishment. We aren't afraid to put our men in the thick of it with Hatta's. South Africa didn't scare us off of war, it just made us better at fighting it.\n\nWe will send a fully armed, fully trained, and fully American division to directly aid Hatta. This will be seen as an extreme escalation by the Japanese, but we see it as a challenge they'll inevitably back down from."
 USA_NPP_ship_over_industry_desc:0 "We have sent over industrial aid already, and it has been well appreciated. But we can do better, Hatta's men deserve better.\n\nWe will ship over yet more material to Free Indonesia. This time we will have a focus on constructing military factories. This should hopefully ensure his men are well equipped."
 USA_NPP_to_the_end_of_the_line_desc:0 "We have the factories, we have the industry, and we have the will. We will not allow the American public to get weary about this war like they did with South Africa. We must escalate, and rapidly. We win this now or we lose this forever.\n\nAnother Patriot Division will be sent over. God willing, we will take out Sukarno once and for all. If not, there's no telling what Japan will do in revenge.\n\nAlea iacta est."

USA_RD_INS.01.t:0 "Sukarno's Folly"
USA_RD_INS.01.d:0 "The East Indies have exploded into civil war as the rivalry between President Sukarno of Indonesia and his opposition, led by Vice President Mohammad Hatta, have finally come to blows. Forces across the archipelago are mobilizing and taking sides, as various army regiments and resistance groups flock to the rebels. Already, protestors in major cities, having been broken up through force of arms, are retreating into the jungles to settle in for the long war.\n\nWhile some may be surprised to see the once-beloved Sukarno the target of a civil war, most expert observers have been anticipating such a conflict for years. Sukarno's increasingly dictatorial sway over Indonesia has soured opinion, both in the government and among the people, to the point where his own Vice President had become the greatest voice against him.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Japanese have declared support for their ally in the dictatorial Sukarno, but Free Indonesia is not without potential allies. Despite consisting mainly of hardline communists and Islamists, the rebellion has attracted much support in America from the anti-Japanese National Progressive Party. With such a vital part of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in flames, the United States stands in a unique position to weaken the Japanese stranglehold over Asia-- something that many Americans have been demanding for decades."
USA_RD_INS.01.a:0 "The Great Game for Asia has begun."

USA_NPP_INS.01.t:0 "The Battle Cry of Freedom"
USA_NPP_INS.01.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] stood before a massive press corps, combined with hundreds of citizens, in the auditorium of Johns Hopkins University. He shuffled around his speech notes as the audience eagerly awaited his words on the Indonesian conflict. This was the opportunity; the first chance America had to break the Japanese stranglehold over Asia. He had better make it count.\n\n"Fellow Americans... over the course of the past several weeks, a conflict of a momentous nature has erupted in the reaches of Southeast Asia-- in the island nation of Indonesia. There, as we speak, thousands of men and women are dying for a most righteous cause: the destruction of tyranny. A dictatorial shadow has encompassed that land, and now, an army of freedom-loving peoples are fighting to burn that shadow away."\n\n"...the cause of the Indonesian freedom fighters is one that America shall always support. As our forefathers fought in the valley of Pennsylvania, so too do their heroes fight in the jungles of Java and of Borneo. These men and women, engaged in such a righteous struggle, must not be allowed to fail. However, with the freedom-loving people of America standing behind them, they shall not. Indonesia shall be a free and democratic nation as God has ordained it to be. Together, the peoples of Indonesia and America shall see that tyranny is extinguished from this Earth!""
USA_NPP_INS.01.a:0 "Sic Semper Tyrannis."

USA_INS.01.t:0 "Indonesia Aflame"
USA_INS.01.d:0 "Our analysts' predictions regarding the East Indies have proven frightfully accurate. Sukarno's attempt at using martial law to solve the crisis with the PKI has been a dismal failure; after years of frustration with his despotic administration, liberal democrat Mohammad Hatta has risen up against Sukarno under the banner of "Free Indonesia."\n\nWhile Sukarno may stress that everything is under control, Hatta is moving swiftly to seize the country, having already taken large swaths of Aceh, Borneo, and Papua. This could be a critical opportunity for the United States to gain a new ally against Japanese domination of Asia, as long as we act quickly."
USA_INS.01.a:0 "The Jungle Burns"

USA_INS.02.t:0 "Our Position Secured"
USA_INS.02.d:0 "Today, after months of hard fighting across the archipelago, the Indonesian Civil War has come to an end, as loyalist forces surrender in droves and Sukarno's top generals formally declare the fight over. With Sukarno ousted, the popular front of Free Indonesia has taken power. Comprised of anti-Sukarno republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, this ragtag army proved too strong for the loyalist forces. Already, a democratic government is being set up in Jakarta with much of the former rebel leaders taking up leadership positions.\n\nWith the victory of Free Indonesia, the administration of [GetLeader] has seen a notable increase in popular approval. Having promised the defeat of Sukarno and the triumph of democracy, the President's promise appears to have become reality. Exactly to what degree the United States' support affected the Indonesian Civil War remains a matter of debate, but for now, America seems happy to see a favorable conclusion to the war."
USA_INS.02.a:0 "The jungle finally cools..."

USA_INS.03.t:0 "A Loss of Opportunity"
USA_INS.03.d:0 "Today, after months of hard fighting across the archipelago, the Indonesian Civil War has officially come to an end as the leader of the rebellion has surrendered to President Sukarno. From the balcony of a Jakarta government building, Sukarno delivered a speech, declaring the civil war to be finally over. The opposition forces, comprised of republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, are now surrendering to the government in Jakarta en masse. Already, many of the leaders of the rebellion are being rounded up and then executed or sent to prison.\n\nWith the victory of Sukarno, and his autocratic grip over Indonesia tightened, the American public has become angered and distraught. After so many defeats over the past 20 years, it is still disheartening to see another flicker of liberty be extinguished. Most upset are those in the National Progressive Party, who blame Japanese intervention and a limp-wristed American response for the defeat of Free Indonesia. With another American boondoggle in Southeast Asia, it appears the political establishment in Washington may be harder pressed to keep their jobs in the next election."
USA_INS.03.a:0 "The Jungle Cools"

USA_NPP_INS.01.t:0 "Maximum Pressure"
USA_NPP_INS.01.d:0 "Anger among the National Progressive Party has come to a head this week with the official end of the Indonesian Civil War. Throughout the course of the war, many among the party had organized protests over American neutrality in the conflict, claiming that if the United States had involved itself, it would have been over much quicker and with far less bloodshed. Now, with the war over, any chance for the administration of [GetLeader] to redeem itself on this issue has passed.\n\nDespite claiming that the United States would support the cause of Free Indonesia against the Japanese-backed Sukarno government, President [USA.GetLeader] appears to have fallen through on his promise. No American support ever reached the anti-Sukarno forces in Indonesia, and many have claimed that the President simply allowed the Japanese to reassert their control over the archipelago. Leaders in the National Progressive Party are now calling the President weak, and demanding that a more anti-Japan stance be taken."

Even if we squeak out a victory, I don't think we'll gain anything there an ally of dubious loyalty and the blood of a whole lot of American boys."\n\nLawrence E. Spivak cracked a slight smile, before realizing his interviewee was serious. "Congressman Cooper, you realize you are among an overwhelming minority in saying that?"\n\n"Yes, I do. There is no doubt in my mind that one day, we will look back on American intervention in Indonesia as a terrible avoidable mistake.""

USA_RD_INS.11.t:0 "Minor Protests in Washington"
USA_RD_INS.11.d:0 "There was a small protest along the National Mall today of less than 500 people against the recent deployment of American troops to Indonesia. The archipelago erupted into civil war this year, and the United States has officially intervened on the side of the forces fighting against the regime of President Sukarno. So far, the war has gone relatively well for the United States Marine Corps and Army forces who have been deployed there. There have been no major defeats, and generally, allied forces have been winning more and more victories.\n\nThe protest, largely led by students from Georgetown University and American University, focused on pacifism and the predicted loss of American lives overseas. The march was widely panned, particularly by Senator Strom Thurmond as "a bunch of youngsters who have no idea what they're talking about". Despite the political criticism, experts agree that sentiments expressed in the march are not exclusive to young college students, and that small-scale opposition to the Indonesian War may be seen across the country in coming months."
USA_RD_INS.11.a:0 "This one's going in their file."

USA_RD_INS.12.t:0 "A Bad Day in Berkeley"
USA_RD_INS.12.d:0 "Today, at the University of California, Berkeley, a protest against the Indonesian War turned violent as clashes between National Guard and police forces monitoring the march and the demonstrators themselves. One Berkeley student, whose name is unknown at this time, apparently threw a brick at a National Guardsman in full riot-gear. The brick missed, but still had an impact, as the National Guard raised their weapons and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the mass of students and protestors.\n\nBy the time the protest had been dispersed, more than 20 people had been hospitalized for injuries. Most unfortunately, however, was the case of student James Rector, who was shot with live ammunition by police and killed during the fighting. The violence has had a widely polarizing effect on the United States as a whole, with many calling the protestors thugs, and others calling them heroes. It also highlights the increasing unpopularity of the war in Indonesia and America's involvement in it."

USA_RD_INS.13.t:0 "Burning Pacifism"
USA_RD_INS.13.d:0 "Today, outside the gates of the White House, a pacifist quaker named Norman Morrison doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire. The man appears to not have screamed almost at all, despite the extreme pain, which suggested to investigators some kind of pain killing drug use. After all that remained was a charred corpse, however, the man's child, Emily, was found, with a note describing his reasons for suicide. He wrote that he had done this in protest to President [USA.GetLeader]'s involvement in the Indonesian Civil War, and that he set himself on fire in solidarity with the Indonesian and American boys who didn't choose a death by fire.\n\nThe public and political reaction can be described as nothing short of horrified. Thousands of people are now planning to "March for Morrison" and spread the ideas that he killed himself for. The President has yet to comment on the issue, but the White House is not letting in press at the moment.\n\nMorrison's death and the vast sympathy to it across the country appears to be part of a growing trend of Americans disliking the country's involvement in the Indonesian Civil War. While there is still a great number who call the anti-war demonstrators "traitors", more and more Americans say that the war is costing too much for too little. Whether or not the government will do anything remains to be seen, but if the anti-war movement has a dedication like Morrison's, it's unlikely that the government will have a choice."
USA_RD_INS.13.a:0 "Rest in peace."

USA_RD_INS.14.t:0 "America on Fire"
USA_RD_INS.14.d:0 "Over the past few days, many cities across the continental United States have erupted into violence following a massive series of organized and unorganized protests against the country. The demonstrations were meant to be against the widely-hated American intervention in the Indonesian Civil War, which has seen little returns for a great cost of lives. Reports claim that in many cities, violence was started by police told to disperse the protestors by any means necessary; in others, it appears protestors heard of violence in other cities and/or simply decided to start some themselves.\n\nThe violence is now beginning to calm down, and the cost appears to be astronomical. More than 50 Americans lay dead, all across the country, and hundreds or thousands have been hospitalized from wounds. It is evident from the sheer scale of the riots that the nation as a whole despises the war in Indonesia, and desires a complete end to the conflict."

President [GetPresidentLastName] surveyed the room, knowing the enormity of the moment was giving everybody pause. \n\n"It's been twenty years since the end of the war, gentlemen," President [GetPresidentLastName] said. "A decade or so since Eisenhower tore up the Akagi Accords and admitted Hawaii to the Union. Now it's our turn to finish what he started." \n\nThe proposal - to stand up to Japan at last and to demand negotiations over the Treaty Ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles - would be the most ambitious and consequential diplomatic initiative by the United States in their lifetimes. The eyes of the world, and of the American electorate, would be scrutinizing them under a microscope. There would be no room for failure. \n\nThe Japanese wouldn't simply fold - but it was clear that holding ports halfway across the world, a diplomatic nightmare and impossible to secure, was increasingly unattractive. \n\nHow much could America push, without being pushed aside by Japan in return? It would take the political power of the American government to ensure the successful return of the ports, without giving away the house to the Japanese in the process - but a few concessions here and there might be useful in making demands further down the line..."

The Foreign Minister sighed. "The Americans probably aren't seriously considering going to war for the Ports, but..." \n\nPrime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] nodded somberly. Twenty years after the victory in the Pacific, the ports were rapidly becoming more trouble than they were worth as Japan faced new challenges from every corner. If Japan could walk away from the negotiations with tangible guarantees - open trade, oil provisions, or an enforceable promise to formally recognize Japan's suzerainty over the Sphere - then what were two ports, really? \n\nIt would take every ounce of political and diplomatic capital to keep any deal as favorable to Japan as possible, even if they gave way on certain items to gain a temporary advantage to be used later.

One big problem between our nation and the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the fact that we do not trade enough. Because of this, the Japanese have demanded substantial amounts of oil to make up for their recent shortages. Simply put, the Sphere lacks many of the oil reserves that we have here in the United States. Luckily, the Japanese diplomats seem pretty desperate to sign a contract with us. If we grant them subsidized oil purchases, the economy of the Sphere will continue functioning and we may regain our lost ports. If we help out the Japanese and the Sphere helps us out, we could see a brighter relationship between our two great nations. We also have a chance of bringing American workers back to work for us.\n\nNow, the question of the moment is: how much oil will we give to the Empire of Japan? We could be generous and offer them the substantial amounts of oil they say they need. We could go down the middle and offer them a moderate amount of oil. Finally, we could give them small amounts of oil, but they may not accept the offer. We also need to consider what the Japanese plan to use the oil for. What do you say, Mr. President?"

However, the amount of oil the Americans promise us seems too good to be true.

Diplomats hated stooping so low as to ask the United States for economic assistance; the Empire had triumphed over the States two decades ago, and now they needed their help? Wasn't this the problem that caused World War II in the first place? But they were desperate. Desperate for a resource that would fix the economic problems of an entire region.

 honolulu_accords.25.a:0 "Let the goods flow across the Pacific."

 honolulu_accords.26.t:0 "Not Quite Yet"
 honolulu_accords.26.desc:0 "It appears the embargoes between Japan and the USA will continue for the time being, as the news filtering out from their ongoing summit paint a grim picture of the prospects for a mutual resumption of trade. Representatives from both countries are admitting that the sides are too far apart on the issue for an agreement to take place, and the talks have moved on to other subjects. On both sides of the Pacific, the great hopes placed on the economic benefits of an agreement have been dashed, and businesses are scrambling to reduce stock and cancel orders made in anticipation of a deal.\n\nIt would seem the world is no closer to a thawing in relations between the USA and Japan."
 honolulu_accords.26.a:0 "Making up is hard to do."

 honolulu_accords.27.t:0 "The Terms of the Trade"
 honolulu_accords.27.desc:0 "The Japanese representatives have laid down their terms to restart trade between our respective spheres of influence. They propose a mutual end to the embargo, but have attached proposed tariff reductions to the agreement. While framed as a mutual treaty, it only names sectors where a lowering of tariffs favors Japan at our expense, making it very unbalanced in their favor.\n\nOur advisors are divided in their responses. Some think we should take a hard stance on the issue and demand an end to the embargoes free of conditions, while others point to the massive benefits of signing a deal compared to the cost of accepting the Japan conditions.\n\nHow should we reply?"
 honolulu_accords.27.a:0 "We won't let them take advantage of us."
 honolulu_accords.27.b:0 "We can't risk losing the deal."

 honolulu_accords.28.t:0 "A Second Attempt"
 honolulu_accords.28.desc:0 "Our offer to resume trade in exchange for concessions on tariffs has been declined by the American representative. He states that a resumption of trade should be considered an opportunity to rebuild links between our countries, not to exact petty conditions, and that it will happen mutually and without conditions, or not at all.\n\nWhile it seems on the surface we have the choice between a concession-free deal or no deal at all, some of our advisors are convinced the Americans are bluffing, and that we can get both the trade resumption and the conditions we want if we call their bluff.\n\nHow should we proceed?"
 honolulu_accords.28.a:0 "We can't risk losing the deal."
 honolulu_accords.28.b:0 "They're bluffing, insist on conditions!"

 honolulu_accords.29.t:0 "An Insistant Foe"
 honolulu_accords.29.desc:0 "The Japanese delegation has flatly refused to consider our suggestion for a concession-free resumption of trade. Instead, they have responded by sending us an unchanged copy of their original proposal. We either resume trading on their terms, or not at all, it seems.\n\nWhatever our response, there is no appetite for further negotiation on this subject, and we will soon move on to the next point on the agenda. What shall we do?"
 honolulu_accords.29.a:0 "A bad deal is worse than no deal at all. No dice."
 honolulu_accords.29.b:0 "We have to take the deal we can get."

 honolulu_accords.30.t:0 "The Terms of a Deal"
 honolulu_accords.30.desc:0 "The Japanese delegation has put forward their proposal for the resumption of trade between our economies. While the terms they set forth to end the embargo seem fairly agreeable, they have decided to tie the issue to that of the treaty ports. They demand we pay a hefty sum of money for the return of the ports, and have made a deal on their transfer a condition for the resumption of trade.\n\nWhile placing this condition on what could've been a straightforward subject to resolve has outraged most of our delegation, with many calling for an immediate end to negotiations, cooler heads point out that access to the vast Asian markets is a prize well worth the cost. At the very least, we should attempt to separate the issues and offer a condition-free resumption of trade.\n\nWhat should our response be?"
 honolulu_accords.30.a:0 "We'll pay for the ports if it makes them happy."
 honolulu_accords.30.b:0 "Trade will resume without conditions or not at all."

 honolulu_accords.31.t:0 "Back at the Table"
 honolulu_accords.31.desc:0 "The reply to our proposal for a deal for an end to the embargoes and the paid transfer of the treaty ports came in today. The Americans have declined. Expressing outrage at our attempt to exact conditions for the return of the ports, they insist on dealing with the issues of trade resumption and port transfer separately. Their counter proposal is similar to our original draft, but has all references to the treaty ports removed. It seems clear that our respective stances are simply too far apart to reach a combined agreement, and our choice is between a mutual end to the embargoes with no further conditions, or no deal at all.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 honolulu_accords.31.a:0 "We'll take their deal."
 honolulu_accords.31.b:0 "We won't stand for this, push back one more time."

 honolulu_accords.32.t:0 "The Offer, Again"
 honolulu_accords.32.desc:0 "Mr. President, we have received some unfortunate news from the Japanese government. After we refused to subsidize their trade involving the ports, they proposed that we give them a large sum of money instead; we also refused this proposal. Now the Japanese diplomats are sending us a harsh ultimatum: either we pay Japan money in exchange for the treaty ports or the Honolulu Accords will be canceled immediately.\n\nWe have to consider our next move in this argument. We can pay directly for the ports to be returned and not have to worry about paying subsidies to Japan. Alternatively, we could just end the meeting here and not give the Japanese anything. Nevertheless, diplomats on both sides are very eager to reach an agreement, and we must be swift in our response. What shall we do, Mr. President?"
 honolulu_accords.32.a:0 "Give in to demands and pay the money."
 honolulu_accords.32.b:0 "Decline and end these negotiations."

 honolulu_accords.33.t:0 "The Third Clause"
 honolulu_accords.33.desc:0 "It's time to move on to the third and last issue: The Treaty Ports. It's obvious to everyone that no real rapprochement between our nations is possible while the Japanese occupy part of the American mainland, with all of the threats that imply, and the Japanese have indicated their willingness to return the Ports. The specifics of the transfer has been left to the end of the negotiations, and this will be the last clause up for discussion. We have a few options for how we position ourselves to approach these final negotiations.\n\nOur advisors fear that a straightforward transfer will be perceived in Japan as a loss of face, and that the politics of that perception might jeopardize the negotiations. To avoid this, they say, we should offer to demilitarize the ports upon transfer. By doing so we will ensure the Japanese have something they can point to as "getting in return" - enabling them to transfer the ports without appearing weak.\n\nOthers in our administration counsel a tougher approach. The goal of the whole summit, they say, is to turn a page on our relations with Japan, and that can only be accomplished if they agree not only to the port transfer, but to demilitarize Hawaii. With the Hawaiian Missile Crisis in all too recent memory, they claim the asymmetry of mutual threat will soon cause a rise in tensions back to previous levels as long as the Japanese garrison the island chain. Our most hawkish counsel suggests we can demand the demilitarization of Hawaii without offering to demilitarize the ports in turn. According to them, it's the only solution the man in the street will accept, and thus the only way to prevent future resentment from souring relations.\n\nWhat approach should we choose?"
 honolulu_accords.33.a:0 "Unilateral demilitarization is a small price for our ports."
 honolulu_accords.33.b:0 "Free ports and demilitarized islands will secure relations."
 honolulu_accords.33.c:0 "The Japanese must demilitarize Hawaii before we receive our ports."

 honolulu_accords.34.t:0 "미국의 제안"
 honolulu_accords.34.desc:0 "It is time to move on to the third and last issue up for negotiation: The return of the Treaty Ports to the USA. The American delegation has opened the negotiations by sending a proposal for a conditional transfer where they pledge themselves to demilitarize the ports for the rest of the treaty period if we allow the transfer to go ahead. Most of our advisors consider this a favorable deal. It accomplishes our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA, while scoring us a victory in the form of demilitarization.\n\nSome, however, are saying that American willingness to accept such conditions betray the weakness of their position, and suggest we push to attach a second condition to the transfer - making the ports a special customs territory shared between our two nations. This will secure our traders and merchant fleets valuable bases of operations for their future American endeavors. It will also, however, provide ample opportunities for smugglers and will almost certainly be considered as onerous and unreasonable by the Americans.\n\nWhat should we tell their delegation?"
 honolulu_accords.34.a:0 "The ports will be a special jurisdiction."
 honolulu_accords.34.b:0 "The ports will be demilitarized."

 honolulu_accords.35.t:0 "일본의 반응"
 honolulu_accords.35.desc:0 "The Japanese delegation has responded to our generous offer of port transfer for demilitarization with a further demand. They want the ports to make up a "joint customs zone", effectively granting their merchants a jurisdiction in America.\n\nMany in our administration are outraged. If the purpose of the port transfer is to reobtain control over the ports, then accepting the "joint customs zone" defeats that purpose, allowing the Japanese to continue to have a say in the comings and goings of goods through the ports. We'd also open ourselves up to potential smuggling operations out of the zones. Accepting such a blatant power-grab would also encourage Japan to continue this "bad-faith" approach in future talks between our countries, according to these advisors.\n\nOn the other hand, this could be the final hurdle of the negotiations. Paying this price, however unreasonable we find it, will secure the port transfer. That might just be worth swallowing our pride. What should we do?"
 honolulu_accords.35.a:0 "We can give a little ground."
 honolulu_accords.35.b:0 "We stand by our original offer."

 honolulu_accords.36.t:0 "미국의 반응"
 honolulu_accords.36.desc:0 "The Americans have flat out refused to consider our demand for a joint customs zone in the treaty port territories. Their negotiators are labelling it "egregious" and "insulting" and have made it very clear that they won't countenance it under any circumstances. Once they finished expressing their outrage, they informed us that a demilitarization is still on offer, a worthy price, according to them, we could obtain by agreeing to the transfer. \n\nMost of our delegates counsel accepting this deal as favorable and closing this clause. Predictably, there are a few voices that speak in opposition, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining national pride and a projection of strength, and demanding we secure compensation for the ports that "match the value of the blood spent" in securing them.\n\n However we respond, there's no further room for negotiation, so we should choose our reply carefully."
 honolulu_accords.36.a:0 "Demilitarization secures our interests."
 honolulu_accords.36.b:0 "No Customs Zone, no port transfer."

 honolulu_accords.37.t:0 "No Agreement In Sight"
 honolulu_accords.37.desc:0 "After several long days and nights spent in discussion, our delegation has informed us that tabling the current clause is the only agreement they could find with their Japanese counterpart. Japan's position and ours are simply too far apart on the issue for negotiations to proceed further, and it's better to move on before the deadlock puts any further strain on the negotiations. There is still a slim hope we will get the ports back, but that hinges on Japan judging our progress on the other two clauses to be important enough to reconsider their stance. If they don't, the outcome of the whole summit is in doubt."
 honolulu_accords.37.a:0 "A treaty seems one step further."

 honolulu_accords.38.t:0 "Agreement Reached"
 honolulu_accords.38.desc:0 "After several long days and nights spent in negotiations, our delegation is delighted to inform us that they have reached a comprehensive agreement with their Japanese counterparts. As they toast our success, our brightest policy experts are poring over the proposed clause, perfecting wording and ensuring consistency between the English and Japanese translations. Soon, it will be time to sign, and not long after, we hope, we will finally have our territory back. Our success on this clause bodes well for the outcome of the whole summit."
 honolulu_accords.38.a:0 "One step closer to a comprehensive treaty."

 honolulu_accords.39.t:0"The American Proposal"
 honolulu_accords.39.desc:0"It is time to move on to the third and last issue up for negotiation: The return of the Treaty Ports to the USA. The American delegation has opened the negotiations by sending a proposal for the port transfer to be accompanied by mutual demilitarization. They pledge to keep the returned ports exclusively civilian, but ask that we demilitarize Hawaii in return. With the Missile Crisis in recent memory, they claim our forces on the island chain imply a threat to their country, which must be removed for normal relations to resume.\n\nAgreeing to this proposal will accomplish our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA. According to our advisors, however, it is far from balanced. The docks in Hawaii are vital for our operational capacity in the East Pacific. Losing them will force us to choose between reduced operational space, which will surely anger our admirals, or constructing new docks on different islands, which will be expensive. The Americans have already more than replaced the docking capacity they lost when we occupied the ports, and are in no great need of them for their navies.\n\nSome in our delegation point out that while this particular clause may be unbalanced, we risk losing our gains in the earlier clauses should we push the Americans too hard on this issue. Are we willing to do that over a naval base?"
 honolulu_accords.39.a:0"The ports will be demilitarized, Hawaii will not"
 honolulu_accords.39.b:0"Mutual demilitarization will ensure peace"

 honolulu_accords.40.t:0"The Japanese Response"
 honolulu_accords.40.desc:0"Our request for demilitarization of Hawaii has apparently not been well-received in the Japanese camp. Flatly refusing to consider the merits of our proposal, they say that port transfer is the only issue up for discussion. Demilitarization is only a part of these talks as the condition for port transfer, they say, and they insist equally firmly on this condition and the complete impossibility of reciprocation. The Hawaiian Missile Crisis, they "remind" us, was caused by "American recalcitrance" and "our internal failures driving foreign policy decisions", and the onus is "entirely on the USA" to prevent a repeat of the event.\n\nMany in our administration point out that this arrogance is typical of the Japanese in their dealings with us. Discussions are completed on the clauses that matter to the Japanese, so they've reverted to their attitude of "victorious conquerors", dictating demands to a vanquished foe. If we accept their diktats, they say, we'll set up for them to continue their arrogant disregard for our interests in our future dealings as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the success of the summit hinges on us finding some way to accommodate both nations here, and we might need to give them this to prevent the negotiations from unraveling entirely. However we reply, there will be no room for further negotiations on the issue. What should we say?"
 honolulu_accords.40.a:0"Only the ports will be demilitarized"
 honolulu_accords.40.b:0"We will insist on a civilian Hawaii"

 honolulu_accords.41.t:0"The American Response"
 honolulu_accords.41.desc:0"The American delegation has finished mulling over our reasonable objection to their demands for a Hawaiian demilitarization. They are not pleased. After expressing their outrage at what they consider "callousness" and "arrogance" on our part, they have resubmitted their original proposal, restating the need for a neutral East Pacific. A "rebalancing of strategic threat", they say, is a prerequisite for a productive future relationship between our nations, and they seem willing to stake the outcome of the whole summit on getting it.\n\nOur delegation is united in condemning the arrogance of this demand. We are already willing to transfer the treaty ports and it's outrageous of them to demand more, they say. Hawaii is also a significant strategic asset, and demilitarization would lose both our navy and air force an important base.\n\nOn the other hand, we risk losing the economic benefits we've worked so hard to secure ourselves in the first two clauses. However we proceed, the lines are now firmly drawn, and there will be no further negotiations on this clause. What will we do?"
 honolulu_accords.41.a:0"We have to accept a demilitarized Hawaii"
 honolulu_accords.41.b:0"We can't accede to outrageous demands"

 honolulu_accords.42.t:0"The American Proposal"
 honolulu_accords.42.desc:0"The American delegation has opened talks on the third and last clause by expanding the scope of the negotiations. In addition to the original subject, the transfer of the treaty ports back to US control, they are also calling for a demilitarization of Hawaii. They justify this brazen demand by stating that the purpose of the clause is to secure peace and future relations, and that this objective demands a "neutral East Pacific", "as the Hawaiian Missile Crisis has shown".\n\nWe are well within our bounds to refuse this. We never agreed to discuss the status of Hawaii and are under no obligation to. Some of our delegation are calling for us to punish the Americans for their brash behavior by attaching conditions, including demilitarization, to the ports instead. Others see the demand as a bluff, the Americans trying to shore up their position for the negotiation, and suggest we offer up a bargain - we will demilitarize Hawaii, as they ask, if they will agree to limit the returned ports to civilian purposes as well.\n\nA few advisors are cautioning against seeing the proposal as a negotiation tactic. This is the clause that is the most important to the Americans, and they might very well be willing to stake the entire accords on getting a favorable outcome here. What will we do?"

They seem willing to give ground on both counts, but have made a demand in return: A demilitarization of the returned ports.\n\nWe can't accept a horse-trade like this. The ports, and Hawaii for that matter, are American soil and we can't allow a foreign power to keep making demands and setting conditions for how we act on our own territory. If the Japanese want better relations, they can damn well accept that we won't allow them to keep waving Hawaii-based navies and missiles at our faces. A demilitarized Hawaii means peace in the East Pacific, and peace in the East Pacific is the only outcome we will accept. We will resubmit our original proposal. We will insist on a demilitarized Hawaii."

Our condition for accepting their demand for demilitarization of Hawaii, that they demilitarize the ports in return, has been declined. For any deal to be signed, they say, it must mean the end of Japan dictating matters on US soil, and a demilitarization in California would stand in the way of that aim.\n\nTheir demands are outrageous, far exceeding the scope of what was agreed upon in the lead-up to the summit, and very few would fault us for declining. They want both the treaty ports and a demilitarized Hawaii and they're staking everything else at this summit to get both. Are we willing to do the same?"

Our delegation has remarked on the surprising willingness on the side of Japan to discuss territorial revision and find a compromise in the East Pacific. Together, this provides us with an opportunity too good to pass up. With most of the treaty safely agreed upon, it's time to open discussion on one last question: The return of Hawaii.\n\nIn order to get them to even consider the transfer, we must be prepared to give important concessions in return. Our advisors believe they might ask for a joint or neutral administration of the Panama Canal, extensive arms limitation concessions, or both. Regardless, it might be a price we should be willing to pay. Securing Hawaii would be a fantastic achievement for our government and for the USA, but beyond that, it would cement this treaty as the end of the era of hostility between us and the Japanese.\n\nThe last core US territory still occupied by Japan, its return will mark a true end to the war in the minds of the public and help usher a time of peace in the East Pacific."

Upon finishing inventory and final inspection, sailors have been ordered to stay in their bunks during transit. For the first short leg of its journey back to friendlier waters, each and every Japanese ship has been sneered farewell by jeers, threats and obscene gestures from a hostile city.\n\nToday, as the last Japanese cruiser finally left the port of San Francisco, this ritual was broken. The jubilant crowds, freshly arrived from "port parties" all over the city, waved and cheered our sailors a final goodbye. The Captain of Chikuma called for all hands on deck to witness the event, and soon our sailors were cheering and waving back. Pictures of the exchange are making the rounds on television on both sides of the Pacific, a sure sign to our people that an era of heightened hostility is coming to a close.\n\nNot everyone is equally enthused, of course. Many in our own country are grumbling about how much ground we are giving to the Americans. We can only hope that the economic benefits of the accords will change their minds as they start trickling out to the population.

All across the country, everyday life has given way to "port parties", pulling whole neighbourhoods out into the streets in celebration.The biggest crowds of all have been seen in the treaty port cities themselves. In San Francisco, cheers from the gathered throngs drowned out the voices of the Japanese ambassador and his translator as the last Japanese flag was taken down and the stars and stripes hoisted in its place.\n\nSurprise was evident among the Japanese as well, as the sailors aboard Chikuma found themselves cheered goodbye by the jubilant crowds, the scowls and jeers they had come to expect from Americans replaced by cheerful smiles and waves.

The visit's official intent was a tour around the American capital - a show of goodwill capitalizing on the momentum of the now-named Handover's success.\n\nUnofficially... well, the old man had his suspicions. He thought them confirmed when he entered the Oval Office and saw the President, back turned, inspecting a large canvas map of Hawai'i. The Minister drew in a sharp breath as he took a seat, steeling himself for the last conversation he ever wished to confront in his career.\n\n"I trust the accommodations here are to your liking?" President [GetPresidentLastName] asked without glancing back. The Foreign Minister grunted in assent. Not exactly proper decorum, but he figured the silence meant the President didn't care.\n\n"Good." Leather shoes clacked with polished linoleum as the President shuffled back to the Resolute Desk, pulling several folders out of its cabinet.

"Wouldn't want to keep you from seeing the sights, so I'll keep this brief: we've some ideas for your government's consideration. We'll discuss these more later during your stay."\n\nAs quickly as he had arrived, the Minister left the Office escorted by his assigned guide.

It was only when we dined at the Palacio de las Garcias that the President engaged my queries regarding our trip to an American military installation. The response I received went thus: "We can make it yours, but only if you can make one of yours ours again."\n\n"Frankly speaking, Mr. Prime Minister, we would be fools not to engage with the trade. Besides dog-headed sentimentality over their spoils from the Liberation War, the Navy's other rationale behind Port Yamamoto was that it consolidates our hold over the Pacific Ocean with its bases and strategic location. The Panama Canal offers those in addition to uncontested control over one of the world's busiest shipping routes, notwithstanding the estimated $70 million in revenue it generates every year.\n\n"I sincerely believe the Americans have offered us this exchange only because of the goodwill we've garnered from the Handover. They may not be so generous next time.""
USA.hawaiinegot.4.a:0 "Reply: Ask for a demilitarization clause on both."

USA.hawaiinegot.5.t:0 "제국이 받아들다"
USA.hawaiinegot.5.desc:0 "The Empire of Japan has agreed to our proposed terms and, as we consented, is organizing a conference to discuss demilitarization terms at an unannounced location in an unannounced date. Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] assured our diplomats that both will be duly communicated within the week so to allow us ample preparation time. He also offered his personal congratulations to President [USA.GetLeader] for advancing a diplomatic solution to the "Hawai'ian Question", despite old animosities and new rhetoric from both sides of the Pacific.\n\nThe President's gamble has paid off, at least for now. America anticipates the culmination of [USA.GetHerHis]'s continued success with bated breath and solemn prayer."
USA.hawaiinegot.5.a:0 "[ROOT.GetSheHeCap] will not be found wanting."

USA.hawaiinegot.6.t:0 "Regarding DMZ Enforcement"
USA.hawaiinegot.6.desc:0 "For two avowed superpower rivals, the initial negotiations went surprisingly smoothly. Both parties agreed that lasting peace necessitated the complete absence of military installations and units - troops, planes, ships and missiles - in, above, and about the Hawai'ian Islands and the Panama Canal Zone. Both parties resolved to forbid all military assets from fortifying, basing or, in the case of planes, overflying the aforementioned territories. Both parties also consented to regular inspections by a bipartisan committee, ensuring the agreement's letter and spirit are enforced.\n\nWhere an otherwise ideal negotiation process met the realities of jockeying with a geopolitical adversary was when the frequency of such inspections was broached. Our diplomats, understandably, proposed that the committee convene in an annual basis. The Americans insisted that they convene once every two years instead, stating that sufficiently rigorous inspections for two distinct locations require more time to conduct and report than a year allots. The Japanese delegation's head responded by questioning the need for inspections lasting longer than a year. Their Western adversary's insistence was unperturbed by the dismissal.\n\nAfter several hours of debate (and several emptied bottles of hard liquor), the conference's attendants finally reached a consensus. Henceforth, a committee consisting of select officials and experts from both countries shall inspect Hawai'i and the Panama Canal Zone for breaches of terms..."
USA.hawaiinegot.6.a:0 "...annually."
USA.hawaiinegot.6.b:0 "...bianually."

USA.hawaiinegot.7.t:0 "Regarding DMZ Violations"
USA.hawaiinegot.7.desc:0 "The next obstacle the conference would hurdle was how violations should be addressed. The Japanese delegation emphasized that all parties are bound by the agreement's terms; ensuring such requires appropriate retribution in the event that either party, irrespective of reason, fails to uphold said terms. "Laws are toothless without punishments," said the Japanese Foreign Minister, "and only sharp teeth suffice for treaties between two nations that can end the world with a button press."\n\nOur ambassadors were split on the issue. On one hand, clearly defined punishments for violations within the proposed DMZs disincentivize Japan from using them as de facto outposts for their Pacific-wide cordon sanitaire - provided, of course, that the same penalties apply to them. Those disinclined to trust the Empire's intentions argued that the punishments will be selectively, and aggressively, applied at our disfavor. (Additionally, a minority opined, stringent punishments will prevent us from justifying certain activities through "creative interpretation" of the agreement's terms. Future administrations may find themselves an option short should the need for action in the DMZs arise.)\n\nIn the end, the American delegation..."
USA.hawaiinegot.7.a:0 "...approved disciplinary measures for violating the agreement."
USA.hawaiinegot.7.b:0 "...failed to reach a satisfying compromise with the Japanese."

USA.hawaiinegot.8.t:0 "Regarding the Violations Clause"
USA.hawaiinegot.8.desc:0 "Fortuitously, the Americans also believed in assigning consequences to treaty violations. The final point of contention between both parties was how severe the consequences should be. Less fortuitously, fraying tempers skirted the breaking point at this juncture.\n\nThe last stretch between the negotiations and a lasting peace deal began with our fatigued delegation suggesting "harsh punitive measures" against the reneging country. When asked to clarify by the cautious Americans, they proposed actions ranging from remilitarizing the affected territories to establishing a full embargo. Even talk of declaring the Handover null and void gained traction among its more zealous members - that is, until their arguments were cut short by the meaty thwack of a face meeting fist.\n\nOrder returned to the conference room before the negotiations broke down under an inter-Pacific exchange of blunt force trauma. The Americans, now made both cautious and disheveled, presented their own counteroffer: economic sanctions and immediate withdrawal from all economic, military, and diplomatic agreements signed following the Handover. These will be resumed, they further explain, only when the offending party ceases their violations of the agreement. Efforts to extract more from the delegation was met with the enthusiasm of a stony brick wall.\n\nAs a new day peeked from the window blinders, Japan's diplomats reached their ultimate consensus:"
USA.hawaiinegot.8.a:0 "The Empire is content with the compromise."
USA.hawaiinegot.8.b:0 "The Empire's rivals deserve harder checks."

USA.hawaiinegot.9.t:0 "Handshake"
USA.hawaiinegot.9.desc:0 "The Secretary's sight honed on the outstretched hand. Coarse, wrinkled, about his size at closer squint. A small band that glowed dull against the fluorescent lamps wrung around its fourth finger. Less ornaments than his own and maybe several years more worn, but a wedding ring all the same.\n\nHe glanced at the conference room. Or what was a conference room. Shredded and whole paper covered every square inch of floorboard, topped by stray mug shards slick with drying pools of coffee and the stray blood smear. Its occupants fared little better; either they were dozing off where they stood or sat or laid, wincing at cuts and bruises covered in flimsy gauze pads, or both. 24 straight hours of wheeling and dealing a treaty had taken its toll. No doubt the Japanese were eager to leave with what they had, at least then they'll enjoy sleeping in cushions and for more than a few hours in the flight home.\n\nCan he say the same for his - that they were satisfied with what they had? Will his countrymen approve what he'd wrangled from the Empire when all's said and done? Or will both dig their heels and ask for more?\n\nThe Secretary then turned to the man with the outstretched hand, opposite his side of the long table. Stodgy with a bald spot, purple bags for eyes, a rotund belly protruding from an unbuttoned suit. He might as well have been a middle-aged salaryman coming home from overtime, rather than the Empire's premier representative abroad. Yet his tired smile and open palm seemed to offer a hope just as mundane: peace from across the aisle. The first in a very long time.\n\nNodding to himself, the Secretary of State..."
USA.hawaiinegot.9.a:0 "...clasped the hand firm with his own and shook."
USA.hawaiinegot.9.b:0 "...cleared his throat. "Mr. Minister," he began, "we regret to...""

USA.hawaiinegot.10.t:0 "Response"
USA.hawaiinegot.10.desc:0 "Surrounded by the quietude of his office, Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] comported himself to the picturesque samurai of old - calm, reserved, stoic. Restraint was his shield against missteps, an ever-present risk for those burdening a nation's weight from the mountaintops. Those peers of his who saw only the summit on which he stood would cheer his fall, if not engineer such a tragic occurrence themselves. Hence, His Majesty's loyal servant treated his adversaries as an old boulder treats the moss which grow lush between its cracks.\n\n...He glanced at the Foreign Minister's letter, laid with neither crease nor tear on his desk. The Prime Minister allowed himself a sharp breath and clenched fist. Any more, he feared, would see the Americans' pristine, arrogant, disrespectful... response... suddenly parted sixteenfold.\n\nSpirits above, treading carefully was a harder task than he'd thought. Was not leaving duplicity unanswered more improper than expressing righteous anger against it? Putting paid to America's pretensions, if it protected the Empire's good faith from further abuse, certainly allured to him.\n\nBut he had his Minister's personal appeal to consider. Washington's erratic gestures might simply be a bluff of some sort, the man argued. The closest the Pacific ever has been to certain peace lay just beyond the Empire's fingertips, and will be theirs should it choose to reach out instead of reflexively withdrawing from an impermanent slight. Or so appealed the Minister and his bleeding heart. Was trusting the pacifist's judgement of American grandstanding truly wise?"
USA.hawaiinegot.10.a:0 "Perhaps peace does, as they said, deserve a chance."

"If there is one then it's that Tokyo didn't shut the whole thing down right then and there." After a beat, he added, "My colleague in the Prime Minister's Cabinet ostensibly convinced him not to."\n\n"That just means the Japs didn't roll over at the slightest touch," sneered the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hawkish eyes scanned the Secretary from top to bottom, as if searching for excuses to exploit. "I'd have thought that counts as bad news."\n\n"It means the Empire's willing to stick with what we've negotiated thus far- despite, may I remind you, their people's wishes. Maybe even its own government's."\n\n"So that's the bad news then? Cut to the chase, Mr. Secretary: where do you really stand? Us or them?"\n\n"Gentlemen." The President's chastisement broke through the long-simmering argument, tampering it with the dignitas [USA.GetHerHis] office afforded. Having prevented accusations of treason from being actioned, [USA.GetSheHe] ordered the Secretary to..."
USA.hawaiinegot.11.a:0 "...back out of the negotiations themselves. America sticks to the plan."
USA.hawaiinegot.11.b:0 "...agree to the Empire's lenient terms."

USA.hawaiinegot.12.t:0 "An Ocean Pacified"
USA.hawaiinegot.12.desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean was hardly pacific even before the Second World War. Great powers past had offered at least a stick of kindling to the hearth-fires below the large cauldron, stoking its waters to an even simmer: not too hot that its riches cannot be plumbed, nor too mild that all may freely sate their greed with them.\n\nThis delicate, almost gentlemanly balance was shattered when the world bared witness to boiling seas and a sunset stronger than the daylight sun. As mushroom clouds ended one age and announced the next, many feared the Pacific will forever stay between twilight and Armageddon, kept in place by two ambitions greater than the expanse which they both contest.\n\nSuch fears were laid to rest today by a pair of disheveled ambassadors, all but bracing each other's enervated weights as they hobbled out of a hotel lobby. Against camera flashes and microphones a hand each lifted paper bearing two signatures from the governments of two great nations. Murmured speculation diffused throughout the gathered press before the weary Secretary of State pried open the Foreign Minister's sake bottle with bare teeth, draughted half its vigor, and let loose an emphatic, prophetic cry:"

Yet had not the Rising Sun scorched the forests under whose shade the Eagle once rested? To see its lost glades returned, the Americans replied, is no unreasonable ambition.

USA_the_iranian_civil_war_desc:0 "War grips Iran, one of the few countries in the Muslim world with a strong tradition for democracy. If we are serious about our commitment to ensuring fascism is contained everywhere in the world, we must be as forceful and determined in our response to this civil war as we are in countries like South Africa and Indonesia. The US has always been and will always remain a steadfast ally of antifascists everywhere, and America has always been a true friend of Iran. We must look to organizing a response, we cannot let the fascists control the oil reserves there to fuel their evil empires."
USA_iranian_aid_bill_desc:0 "The House foreign policy committee has swiftly drawn up a bill authorizing dispatch of advisors, equipment and financial aid to Iran, as well as authorizing the government to advertise, organize and dispatch volunteer divisions from both veteran and active duty Army personnel. Once this goes through Congress, help will be on its way to the brave Iranians."
USA_american_aid_inbound_desc:0 "The Iranian Aid Act has been quickly rushed through Congress to ensure a timely response to the crisis there. An immediate loan of $100 million has been granted to the Iranian liberal faction so they can fund their armed forces until American equipment and volunteers can arrive en masse. Initial military advisors are to be dispatched as soon as secure flights can be established, followed by the equipment and then the volunteers. With some luck the Iranian liberal movement will soon be strong and economically stable, a force that can sweep aside the armies of tyranny opposing them."
USA_american_equipment_desc:0 "Coordinating with the Iranian liberals and our advisors, we have set up a pipeline for regular shipments of military equipment between California and Iran, using Australia as a go-between. Sadly, for the moments this limits our ability to send significant quantities for the gear, but the ability for the Iranians to use the remaining money from their loan to buy American weaponry and gear will certainly be a relief for both them and our domestic arms industry."
USA_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "The eagle soars once again to distant shores! Our advisor teams report the bulk of their teams have landed safely in Iran, and request we coordinate with the legitimate, freedom-loving Iranian government to ensure they have translators, staff and vehicles available."
USA_american_loans_desc:0 "The Iranians have run out of money from our initial loan to them! This simply won't do, they are fighting tooth and nail against the enemies of democracy and freedom. Let us pull some strings at the congressional budget office to authorize further Liberty Loans to the Iranian liberals. No amount of money is worth a loss to fascist tyranny."
USA_send_in_cia_advisors_desc:0 "While not mentioned in the official Iranian Aid Act, in the black budget we have set aside money for advisors from REDACTED to instruct and share REDACTED with the Iranian REDACTED services. It is our REDACTED 's hope that this will lead to REDACTED, increased trust, REDACTED, REDACTED, higher recruitment of Persian-speaking operatives, REDACTED, and new perspectives on the regional intelligence situation, especially in regards to REDACTED."
USA_grand_strategy_of_the_iran_war_desc:0 "With the Iranian Civil War still dragging on, our administration finds itself on a crossroads. Should we commit fully, South Africa-style, with boots on the ground and a strong hand, or should we press on with the current strategy of primarily arming the Iranian liberals and letting them fight the war for us? We will need to carefully weigh whether the risk of upsetting the public with another foreign conflict is worth the risk of losing Iran to the forces of tyranny. The economic and geopolitical consequences of the fascists controlling the oil of Iran could be devastating, but a direct intervention can seriously undermine our popularity, not to mention our military budget plans. What should we do?"
USA_promise_more_american_soldiers_desc:0 "We have to go all in on this one, public opinion be damned. We are readying several divisions of intervention troops to help the liberal Iranians win this thing, and have already sent them our assurances more are on their way. Democracy will never die where the torch of liberty shines bright through its soldiers! Forwards to freedom!"
USA_promise_more_american_equipment_desc:0 "We cannot risk another bloodbath like we faced in the jungles this decade. To limit the potential loss of American life without letting the Iranians down, we will instead announce an expansion of our current strategy, with efforts undertaken to greatly increase the quantity of weapons shipments to the Iranian liberals. This will be difficult, but we will be enjoying the cooperation and support of our military-industrial complex, which stands to benefit from the Liberty Loans being spent on their product line."
USA_to_free_the_oppressed_desc:0 "To help build popular support for our intervention in Iran, we have crafted a carefully staged media campaign showing our soldiers and the Iranian liberals working in tandem to bring freedom to the oppressed classes of Iran. Zoroastrians, Christians and women will all feature heavily in the messaging, with starry eyes thanking their American liberators. The coverage will even be mostly true for once, as we really fight on the side of the most tolerant and Western-aligned faction present."
USA_darwin_supply_hub_desc:0 "The biggest hurdle in supplying the Iranians has been that we've relied on Australian shipping for the last stretch of the journey. If we instead repurpose and expand our naval base at Darwin, intended for use in supplying allies and intervention forces in Indonesia, as well as defending Australasia proper, we can move the supplies the whole way on American keel, in larger and faster freighters. This should enable us to greatly expand the transported volume, albeit at a significant monetary cost."
USA_new_contracts_for_military_industral_complex_desc:0 "The promise of fresh contracts delivered the expected support from the large armaments firms. A group of them have promised that they will invest in any efforts we make to expand the supply pipeline to Iran, on the condition that it is structured in such a way as to give them a voice in the running of the products. In normal times this sort of collusion with private arms manufacturers might be seen as unethical, but the last twenty years have been anything but normal, and we have to be ready to work with all our allies to defeat fascism, whether they be countries or corporations. Let us begin the restructuring."
USA_the_beacon_of_hope_desc:0 "We have done everything we can for the Iranian liberals. As we ship off the last of our promised supplies and men, we can only hope that the sacrifices America has made to help the Iranian people rise the torch of liberty against the extremist tyrants surrounding the liberals on all side. One day, Iran will be a true democracy and close ally of our great republic, but if the liberals can win here and now, we will have progressed tremendously in pushing back the darkness of our age. Let the flame of freedom we have lit in the Iranian people forever serve as a beacon of hope to the oppressed all around the Middle East and the World!"
