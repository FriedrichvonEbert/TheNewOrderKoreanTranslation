USA.1705.t:0 "요키의 취임식"
USA.1705.d:0 "미국이 충격에 휩싸여 있고 워싱턴 D.C.에 전경들이 줄지어 배치되어 있는 채 미국 대통령으로 취임하기 위해 프란시스 파커 요키가 미국 국회의사당 건물의 계단을 오르고 있습니다. 불안한 비밀경호국 요원을 옆에 둔 신임 국민진보당 대표는 자신감에 찬 채 연단에 올랐습니다. 모든 역경에도 불구하고 그의 계획은 결실을 맺었으며 미국은 그의 말을 기다리고 있습니다.\n\n연단 주변 인물들은 취임식 때 기대했던 것 보다는 크게 눈에 띄진 않았는데, 공화민주당은 그의 대통령 취임식 참석을 거부하였으며 자기 소속 정당 중 상당수도 참석을 거부하고 있습니다. 독일국에서 온 소규모 대표단을 제외하면 해외 참석자들도 눈에 띄게 드물며 초청객 명단은 대부분 요키의 열렬한 지지자들로 구성되어 있습니다. 요키의 선거관리인인 로이스 드 라파예트 워시번은 카메라를 향해 미소지었으며 수수깨끼의 기부자인 해럴드 케이트 톰슨은 요기조기 보기 좋게 피해갔습니다. 새로 취임한 루이스 바이어스 부통령은 갈색 옷을 입은 지지자들에게 악수하며 사인을 해 주고 있으며, 하원의원 윌리스 카르토와 프레드 헌틀리는 대화를 나누고 있으며 존 크로멜린 제독은 무시무시한 시선으로 군중을 샅샅이 훑어보며 위험의 징후를 찾고 있습니다.\n군중은 세 무리로 나눌 수 있습니다. 첫째로 이 순간까지 닿기 위해 수십년 간 투쟁하며 이겨낸 약자의 후보자에게 동정심을 가지고 그의 비전으로 틀에 잡힐 미국을 보기는 사람들이 있습니다. 둘째로 수정헌법 제1조의 권리를 행사하는 사람들은 다음 취임식이 오기 전까지 권리가 아에 박탈당할까봐 걱정하며 보는 사람들이 있습니다. 마지막으로, 두 집단을 갈라놓는 얉디얉은 의사당 경찰이 있습니다. 서로를 향해 항의하며 박수갈채와 함성이 튀어나오고 사람들은 소리를 들으러고 애씁니다.\n\n요키가 올라감에 따라 그의 연설문이 휘날리는 바람에 솟아오르며 불만을 표하는 소음만이 늘어날 뿐입니다. 최고 권력자는 요키의 지정학 및 문화이론에 대한 걸작인 임페리움을 화자에게까지 확대시킵니다.\n\n패배한 판사의 경멸적인 표정을 무시한 채 그는 한 손을 책 위에 올리며 맹세를 반복합니다.\n\n대통령은 손을 뒤로 젖히고 군중 쪽으로 돌아서서 말하기 시작합니다."

#Leader Description
POLITICS_YOCKEY_DESC:0 "프랜시스 파커 요키는 그가 대통령직에 오르리라고는 거의 누구도 예상치 못한 자였습니다. 그러나 미국 역사상 가장 치열했던 선거가 끝난 이후, 이 노골적인 파시스트는 대통령이 되었습니다. 본래 작가이자 철학자였던 요키는 1930년대 세계를 휩쓴 권위주의와 파시스트 운동에 매료되었습니다. 변호사가 되기 위해 공부하던 그는 아돌프 히틀러의 활동에 특별한 관심을 보였고, 나치의 반유대주의와 국수주의 사상을 받아들였습니다. 그가 스스로 명작이라 칭하는 "임페리움 : 역사와 정치의 철학"의 출간에 뒤이어, 요키는 국가진보당의 초극단적 우파를 창설함으로써 미국 정치에 새로운 움직임을 불어넣었습니다. 국가진보당의 이들 세력은 처음에는 "전미국가수호단"으로 자신들을 지칭했으나, 정계의 다른 모든 세력은 곧 이들을 혐오하게 되었고 요키와 그 추종자들을 단순히 "요키파"로 불렀습니다. 그러나, 이들의 정적들의 실패와 신의 섭리로 인해 그의 세력은 이제 미국의 정치 체계에 맞서 승리했습니다.\n\n요키의 대통령 당선은 쥐새끼 몇마리들 수준을 넘는 반향을 불러일으켰습니다. 미국의 수많은 도시들, 특히나 남부 주들에서 쿠 클럭스 클랜의 두건다린 흰 망토를 입은 자들을 보는 것은 이상한 일이 아닙니다. 비슷하게 지난 20여년 간 기념비적인 민권법안의 폐지에 대한 공공연한 논쟁이 벌어져 왔습니다. 흑인들에 대한 린치가 보편화되었고 이는 조사받지도, 발각되지도 않고 있습니다. 짧게 말해서 혐오가 미국 전역에 공공연화되고 있으며, 정치적 기득권층 내외의 많은 사람들이 이 권위주의적 파동이 어디까지 갈 지를 두려워하고 있습니다.\n\n비록 요키가 지구상의 자유 국가중 가장 강력한 국가의 지도자이긴 하나 그의 자유에 대한 입장은 불명확하고 모순되어 왔습니다. 많은 사람들은 그가 미국의 자유를 지키기 위해 어떤 겉치레를 하든간에 그는 여전히 파시스트이며 대통령직의 권위를 강화시키기 위해서는 무엇이든 할 것이라고 믿고 있습니다. 요키 스스로는 "문화 파괴자들"을 비난하며 서구 문명을 수호한다고 주장하고 있습니다. 요키가 그것을 정확히 어디로부터 수호하겠다는 것인지는 모호하나, 프랜시스 파커 요키 대통령은 미국에 그의 의지를 집행할 준비가 되어 있습니다."

USA.yockey.1.t:0 "Nary the Uncle Lifts this Shadow"
USA.yockey.1.desc:0 ""This is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite..."\n\n"Good evening, tonight, the United States Senate has taken robust measures in ensuring the confirmations of the Cabinet of the President, a maverick of his time as the first member of the NPP's American National Vanguard to reach the Presidency. The day went as follows:"\n\nTaking a deep breath, Cronkite continued, "Firstly, Vice President Louis T. Byers spoke to the Senate, declaring that, 'Today is a great day for Americans across the country, as we don the mantle of security for our statehood and autonomy against the threat of the Zionist, the Communist, and so many other dangerous actors lurking in the shadows as they reach out to brainwash the youth into this deranged and accursed Leftism which has come to dominate us today!'" Cronkite's face furrowed, as he continued to readjust his glasses whilst he spoke, as a pang of fear tore at his heart.\n\n"After a rousing confirmation for Secretary of State Revilo P. Oliver, Treasury Secretary Harold Keith Thompson, um, addressed the Senate, announcing that "I have been, within the wise prerogatives of the President, chosen to take the mantle of managing the American people's economic strength. No one has said that it will be an easy job; however, while some may want to tear it down, I, with the President, armed with Vice President Byers' fire, Secretary Oliver's boldness, and soon-to-be Secretary Crommelin's strength, will bring this nation to unity and strength!'" Cronkite's hand wiped across his face slowly, as the black, crackling of the screen was met with silence on the acclaimed reporter.\n\n"And, finally, we, we saw Rear Admiral John G. Crommelin take his stand to the, the Senate, today. As he said, '"It is with many thanks that I find myself approved to take action as Secretary of Defense over this fine nation's military. Jews and liberals have shaken our structure to the core, and it is with hope that the President and I can work together to, um, bring security to us all.'"\n\nCronkite stared long and hard to a space unseen by the rolling cameras brightening the living rooms of Americans, now shrouded in the night's darkness. As a tear befell his cheek, the iron-willed reporter found his throat crushed, unable to speak any but eight more words..."

Ten digits in ten seconds - if Regulus Philips wasn't worrying himself sick, he'd have averaged half that for a number he'd been calling for five years straight.\n\nOne second became two, then three, then ten. The colored man gripped the cherry red receiver a little tighter before someone picked up. Sighing he said, "Sarah, Reg. I'd like to get boss Evan on the line; something's come up and the Board's gotta act soon."\n\n"And who's this supposed to be?"\n\nEyes widened. The voice wasn't Evan's secretary's. Hell, it wasn't even a woman's at all. "Oh- uh. M-Mr. Regulus Philips, sir," he stammered. "I was told this is the landline for Commissioner Evan Winters' office. May I speak to him?"\n\n"Winters? The race traitor?" Thick and twangy chuckles carried through the static. "Fella won't be bothering nobody no more, I'll give you that."\n\nIce crept into Philips' veins as the voice drawled out his enlightenment. "So that's how it is. Well let me tell you something, Bubba: whatever burning questions y'got, the answer's probably yes. Ballot drop-offs are being shut down across Cook County. Gangbangers are getting their votes taken from them. And no more couriers fiddling with fancy mail too; either show up like a man or your vote don't matter.\n\n"But don't you worry your pretty little head, boy. It's all for a good cause.""

USA.yockey.3.t:0 "A Dark Eclipse of a Voter's Sun"
USA.yockey.3.desc:0 "How oppressive could the very weather get? Thomas Gravois pondered such a question as he continued to breathe the ocean of New Orleanian humidity into his lungs, as he felt the sweat drip down to his hand, clasped hands with his girlfriend, Lily Babineaux. The brewing stormclouds above proved no use to uplift Louisiana from the terrific heat that struck down upon the South. \n\n"First vote, first vote, good lord, gonna be fun! I know we missed this past Presidential election, but hell, voting for a Congressman can't hurt, can it, Lily?" Thomas said. \n\nLily nodded, and smiled, as she felt happy, but the pangs of worry continued to dawn in her, as she saw more and more whispering couples heading towards the booth. \n\n"I mean, just think of it, we got Republicans, Democrats, all sorts on the NPP, I mean, I know that President Yockey's not the most popular between us, and I'm not meaning to force you to vote for anybod-" Gravois said, before being cut off by a rushing police car, blaring its siren. \n\n"I don't know, Thomas, are we sure today's going to be a good day for participating within this here election? I know it's important and all, but something just ain't right about all of this, I bet you can feel it too." She says, as the rumble of thunderous stormclouds rolled within the distance. Sweat continued to bear down the couple's foreheads as they stopped for a brief moment. \n\n"Now, sweetie, I know it's nerve-wracking and all, but we gotta do what we can for our country, both our fathers served our country back in-" \n\n"Thomas..." Lily whispered. \n\nThe two looked forward, and none of the cheery election seasons of the past prepared them for the sight. No barbecues, no pins and stickers, no cheers and laughs from the crowds, but only the roaring of helicopters and armed guards roaming about. Between each booth laid an officer in riot gear, bearing the symbols of the American National Vanguard., as the crowd was moved forward with police on each side. Loudspeakers, sirens, all blared out, as lines were monitored, people were monitored, for God's sakes, each vote was monitored. The young couple looked at one another, wanting to back away and run all the way back home, but the shining glimmer of an officer's badge, lined up next to a patch for the Vanguard, shone into their eyes, as he beckoned them forth."

USA.yockey.4.t:0 "An End to Tyranny"
USA.yockey.4.desc:0 "There had been so much hope, last year.\n\nThe Congressional Caucus meeting would have been overwhelming enough for any freshman representative; it was worse for the few new C-NPP delegates. Jackson's defeat in the primaries had shattered the party and caused a slump in turnout, and the center had suffered the most. Pat Schroeder of the Colorado 1st had barely won in the recount, with a split vote between her, the RD candidate, and her primary opponent who had refused to acknowledge his defeat. The right had given warm welcomes and firm handshakes, but the Vanguard congressmen had not- despite being far from firmly controlling the party, they seemed to be in no hurry to reach across the aisle.\n\n"In these halls of Washington where conspiracy and scheming against the West has become the order of the day, we have removed the corrupters from the levers of power, and now bring them out to the observation and scrutiny of all clear-minded American observers."\n\nThe President had been speaking for some time. A title ill-suited for an unimposing man with a pompous and arrogant manner of speech, but an unmistakable knack for telling people what they wanted to hear. He almost looked fearful as he spoke, despite his power, as if one slip of the tongue might bring his regime crashing down. They had no majority without the party. They needed every vote they could get.\n\n"And we hold this truth to be self evident, that after a long train of abuses and usurpations, an usurpation of our own has become necessary, and with your support, we have achieved it! Regardless of what the legalities imposed on us by traitors demand, we shall no longer dictate to our Southern brethren how they ought to enforce their laws!"\n\nAnd the furious sound of applause echoed through the halls, and hope was extinguished."

Didn't think he'd go so easily- not with the way things have been going.\n\nKESSLER: He's been here a long time, and with Hoover gone- well, he's been meaning to retire, I'm sure. You know, he was hunting down Nazi saboteurs on the East Coast back in the 40s like everybody in the bureau. Don't think we'll be doing much of that now that we've got one in the White House.\n\nWITTENFIELD: It doesn't make sense to me, if he hates them so much.\n\nKESSLER: Course it does- they're already killing democracy, anyone can see that.\n\nWITTENFIELD: No, he won't stick around long. Folks'll see him for what he is soon enough. No chance he gets reelected. Till then we've got to do our jobs as best as we can, make sure there's no abuse of power-\n\nKESSLER: You're not seriously thinking about staying on, are you? He's already turning the Bureau into his personal Gestapo- why else would we be investigating the leftists in his party?\n\nWITTENFIELD: Well, you've got to watch out for the Nicks too- who knows what they're going to try now that Yockey's elected.\n\nKESSLER: Yeah, famed communists Scoop Jackson and Margaret Chase Smith need to be investigated. You stay here, you're supporting the White House in destroying democracy.\n\nWITTENFIELD: Calm down, Harry, you don't want to be saying those sorts of things here, not so loud anyway.\n\nKESSLER: You think they've started spying on the bureau already? Suppose it doesn't matter what I say then. Or did they tap you for it, seeing as you're all for bootlicking?\n\nWITTENFIELD: Hey, don't blame me. I voted for McNamara."

What does the president plan to do regarding disciplinary problems such as the incident aboard the Patrick Henry last week?"\n\n"Well, Tom, with the state of the world as it is, discipline in the armed forces is essential, especially on critical assets such as our ballistic missile subs. We will not tolerate anti-white activism when it interferes with the operation of military vessels, not when we face an existential threat across the Pacific.

USA.yockey.7.t:0 "One Great Step into the Breach"
USA.yockey.7.desc:0 "Thunder rumbled amidst the skies of Washington D.C., as the capital of that Last Bastion of Democracy felt the churning rage of the thunderous old gods, as they peered down from the heavens and rained all form of punishment upon the ground below, as cold winds, cracks of lightning, and endless rains fell. Nevertheless, such distractions failed to rip the steel-eyed gaze of President Francis Parker Yockey away from the report on his desk, as the bushled face of his Vice President came in, unannounced. \n\n"Well, it looks we have some good news coming in this morn-" said Vice President Byers.\n\n"I understand. The true first step into the cull of the Culture-disease has begun, Vice President Byers. This engine of liberalism, this distorter of the morally-superior, finally, shredded apart amidst the powerful claws of Western Civilization, like the muck it is." President Yockey declared, monologueously, as he scrapes a piece of dirt from beneath his finger with his sharp thumbnail. "Vice President Byers, I implore you allow yourself to be seated for the world's next-spun few minutes, and listen towards the successes of the American National Vanguard against the likes of the tumors of Democracy." The words floated around the mind of Vice President Byers, and while his superior's rhetoric typically left him with a sense of pride pinned by a dosage of dread, he used the opportunity to listen in, as President Yockey flipped open the radio signal. The crackling emitting throughout the silence of the two men only fell broken by President Yockey's next words. \n\n"Commanders of the Police Units stationed across the Country, I hereby, under the powers vested within me by the Spirit of America, under which our Congress has granted me legislative authority unto declaring, authorize for the execution of Order 2237, allowing for the sinceforth enforcement of the Safeguarding America's Fundamental Exceptionalism Act against all potentially law-breaking degenerative media-sources from across the country. Protect America's Spirit at all costs."\n\nThe President then offered a rare glimpse into his smile to his Vice President, as he stood upwards, wandered towards the windows behind him in the Oval Office and stood, arms folded behind his back."

Anger? Nonsense, Vice President Byers, you fail to understand me if you misconstrue my soul's perturbedness if you construct it into the childlike frustration felt like men such as Secretary Crommelin, and all of the inbred 'patriots' scurrying about the Midwest and South, Vice President. Rather, this Judeo-Bolshevik machination, this rebellion-child sprung from the seeds of Democracy, Liberalism, and the Constitution itself, this instigates not Child-like tantrums within my soul, but a greater understanding as to the frustrations to be held in reshaping this world. The Vanguard is prepared to mantle the mission of establishing National Socialism in the likes of this damned Country, no matter if the socialist, Jew, or otherwise soulful-degenerate is unwilling. The Safeguarding America's Fundamental Exceptionalism Act is aborted, Vice President Byers; however, our future soul-destiny is not quenched beneath the suffocation of virtue that liberalism exists as."

One series of numen in particular poisons the American mind: E Pluribus Unum. That Unum has been destroyed by the many. It has been embezzled by the Jews. It has been raped by the Negro. It has been barbarised by the Slav.\n\nThis was no accident.\n\nThe disease of culture-distortion that afflicts America is a construction, an archaic Grecian statue marred by those who subtly disfigured her face until it became indistinguishable from that of a beast. She is Western Civilization, the ultimate manifestation of the High Culture.

True ethico-politico-cultural realization can only come with the appointment of our own officials, those who will smoke out the rats that lurk in synagogues, mansions, and banks.\n\nThe obstacles to this step are immense. Our power in Congress is greatly limited; even the majority of the staunch segregationists have decried the election of President Yockey. An entire legion of culture-distorters has been shocked into extreme anti-Western negativist measures by our swift rise to power, and will do their best to obstruct our path to supremacy. However, we possess the stronger will-to-power and remain free of the by-products of Rationalist thought that have poisoned the minds of America's political class.

Instead, the harvesters of cultural stupidity agitate this soil in pursuit of dilution of the High Culture.\n\nThe machinations and schemes by which they agitate are universal to America. Through the extension of the lie of democracy and the curse of liberty to the backwards races, they accomplish disruption of the failing Authority of Western Civilization. Through the promotion of anti-spiritualist values and primitive imitations of the Culture they distance the young Idea-bearers from the birthright of their original soil.\n\nThis mechanism must be disrupted and broken apart if we are to preserve a future for the ailing superorganism. Readjusting the government's electoral expenses to the areas that are less polluted by liberal negativists will enable this.

There are no publications in America addressed solely to the intellect; a Culture-distorting regime rests on its invisibility, and independent thinking by strong individuals is ipso facto hostile to such a regime. Nor are there any publications which purvey only facts. Any facts, and any viewpoints, are coordinated with their presentation into the ruling propaganda-picture.\n\nIt is imperative that the danger of these publications be brought to the forefront of the Western culture-mind apparatus.
