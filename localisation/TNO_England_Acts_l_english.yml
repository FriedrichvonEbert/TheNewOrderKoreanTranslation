ENG_acts.1.t:0 "The Act Passes"
ENG_acts.1.desc:0 "An elderly man sat on a bench reading the local newspaper. The front page reads of the affairs in Westminster. Around him the streets were slightly livelier. The skies above were slightly clearer. News had spread that a new Act of Parliament had passed through the House of Commons and became part of the law of the land. News anchors on live television discussed the ramifications of this recent development. Politicians declared this day as a major success for their party and the country of England. The futures of millions of men and women will be affected by this law even if they never hear of it. Only time will tell whether that's for the better or the worse."
ENG_acts.1.a:0 "English history is written."
ENG_acts.2.t:0 "The Act Fails"
ENG_acts.2.desc:0 "On the TV screen, a reporter announced that the new Act was voted down by the MPs in the House of Commons. The opposition and many media sources have denounced the Prime Minister as incompetent. Even MPs in government have questioned the leadership of their party. Everywhere, people around England hear only of failure, and for every government failure, the people's confidence in the government's ability to rule is reduced. If the Prime Minister can not control Parliament, then soon enough, they won't be able to control England."
ENG_acts.2.a:0 "Hopefully, the next one will turn out better."

NDL_Act_County:0 "The Counties Act"
NDL_Act_County_desc:0 "During the German occupation of England, the borders of the counties were redrawn by the collaborators to suit their needs. Now, we can redraw the borders of the counties to fit their historical origins and allow for better local governance. From Northumberland to Kent, the counties will be restored to their past selves. This will be the first step to erasing the legacy of collaboration throughout England."

NDL_Act_Lords:0 "The Lords Act"
NDL_Act_Lords_desc:0 "In order to assure there was no resistance in Parliament, the Royal Party stacked the House of Lords with German collaborators and corrupt aristocrats. This has created an inefficient and unscrupulous institution. With this Act, we will reform the House of Lords and remove the titles from traitorous and incompetant lords. The last collaborators in the English government will be removed."

NDL_Act_National_Education:0 "The National Education Act"
NDL_Act_National_Education_desc:0 "The key to rejuvenating the English economy after the crisis is education. This Act nationalizes some parts of the system to standardize the curriculum and ensure qualified teachers. Reorganizing schools to add modern science and mathematics into the curriculum. We may not have the fields of British India or the diamond mines of South Africa anymore, but we still have our minds."

NDL_Act_Worker_Protection:0 "The Worker Protection Act"
NDL_Act_Worker_Protection_desc:0 "A lack of regulation in the English workplace has caused accidents everywhere from the coal mine to the meat factory. This Act implements some basic safety regulations on businesses to stop these accidents. Safety inspectors would go around England to check on businesses and ensure they're following our codes. English workers will be able to be safe at their workplaces as well as their homes. Hopefully, Englishmen will see that they don't need socialism to be safe."

NDL_Act_Children_and_Wives:0 "The Children and Wives Act"
NDL_Act_Children_and_Wives_desc:0 "Children and women are unprotected under their current laws especially orphans and widows. This Act begins to give aid and safety to these groups of people. We will set up public shelters and organizations to help women and children. Orphanages and charities across England will be boosted by government funding. While not much, this will hopefully open English society to more change in the future."

NDL_Act_Sexual_Offenses:0 "The Sexual Offenses Act"
NDL_Act_Sexual_Offenses_desc:0 "Homosexual men and women has long been suppressed by English law and society. While this Act may not result in acceptance by the orthodox English society, it will decriminalize homosexuality. This step forward shows to the world that England is a liberal nation moving ahead of the rest of the world. On the other hand, English traditionalists are outraged and are mobilizing everything to stop this Act from passing. Passing this Act would clearly show that NDL has no place for conservatives who can not see the future."

NDL_Act_Border:0 "The Border Act"
NDL_Act_Border_desc:0 "England is one of the only free nations of Europe, so it's natural that every year, thousands brave the English Channel to liberty. The Patriots within government are concerned about the potential security and economic threat from the influx of refugees. This Act puts a limit on the amount of people that can enter England and put tighter restrictions on the border. It may be wrong for us to turn away innocent people fleeing Nazism, but surely we can't admit every man, woman, and child in Europe to England."

NDL_Act_Preservation_of_Democracy:0 "The Preservation of Democracy Act"
NDL_Act_Preservation_of_Democracy_desc:0 "Democracy in England must be preserved at all costs; it has a proud history from the creation of Parliament to today. Our democratic tradition was nearly snuffed out however with the German occupation and the reign of Nazism. The only way to ensure that democracy is safe is to throw out those who would end it. This Act bans radicals from entering politics from the left or the right. No longer will fascists have a voice in the houses of Parliament."

NDL_Act_Investigations:0 "The Investigations Act"
NDL_Act_Investigations_desc:0 "There are minor areas of corruption within our great English society. While nothing truly damaging, we must prevent further spread. This Act allows the government to investigate private companies and officials based on suspicious activity. Government agencies would be able to conduct raids and infiltrate companies and also investigate members of Parliament. Giving the government authoritarian powers may have some benefits."

NDL_Act_Housing:0 "The Housing Act"
NDL_Act_Housing_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues facing England currently is housing. A small number of landowners control most of the houses which causes overpricing. This Act regulates land prices with governmental housing programs. Building new houses as well as renovating old ones. This will hopefully result in more affordable housing for the English poor. We can't just let people live without a roof over their heads."

NDL_Act_Business:0 "The Business Act"
NDL_Act_Business_desc:0 "An efficient way to kickstart our economy and prevent control from foreign corporations is to help small businesses. This Act allows for the government to give special funds to small businesses to provide more jobs and more goods in the market. The everyday business owner will surely support us now. Common workers may initially be outraged by the handouts to businesses, but they'll change their minds when the economic boom starts."

NDL_Act_National_Healthcare:0 "The National Healthcare Act"
NDL_Act_National_Healthcare_desc:0 "Healthcare is the most popular demand from the masses. Enacting a form of national healthcare would massively raise our support, but there are still some concerns about the price. This Act specifically sets up a National Health Service, a government-funded system that would provide healthcare for those in need. Socialists claim this is insufficient while economic conservatives and businesses say that this is socialist policy. We need to raise support for this Act in Parliament, for this would be our greatest reform yet."

NDL_Act_Affordable_Education:0 "The Affordable Education Act"
NDL_Act_Affordable_Education_desc:0 "Education is no good if the majority of people can't afford it. Currently, schools are inaccessible to disadvantaged children no matter how intelligent. This Act lowers the cost of education, so all people poor or rich can get an education for their children. Passing this Act would be an investment in the future; while giving every child in England 12 years of school is obviously expensive, there is no price too high for the future of England."

SLP_Act_Lords:0 "The Lords Act"
SLP_Act_Lords_desc:0 "The House of Lords has seen better days. While technically the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords has been rendered powerless through the years, and the Royal Party has not improved the situation. Through the German occupation, the collaborators appointed their allies and corrupt aristocrats into Parliament. This Act reforms the entirety of the House of Lords by eliminating hereditary seats, spiritual seats, and taking away peerage from collaborators. This is the first step in reforming government from a force of reaction into a defender of socialism and democracy."

SLP_Act_Women_Pension:0 "The Women's Pension Act"
SLP_Act_Women_Pension_desc:0 "It is clear that women deserve workers' rights equal to men. The amount of women in the workforce is steadily increasing, but they currently don't enjoy pensions and rights like their male counterparts. This Act fixes this by granting more pensions and giving them to men and women equally. No longer will wives be dependent on their husbands after retirement. Solidarity is not divided by lines of gender."

SLP_Act_Equality:0 "The Equality Act"
SLP_Act_Equality_desc:0 "Equality for all applies to women too. The old English society used oppression against women to further their goals of dividing the working class. No longer will we let the differences between workers divide us. This Act gives many rights and privileges to women in all areas of law. This is a major break in the old system, and it will show that England is a land of equality for all and truly the land of the free."

SLP_Act_Equal_Vote:0 "The Equal Vote Act"
SLP_Act_Equal_Vote_desc:0 "Democracy is a worker's tool to overthrow the ruling class, but a necessary prerequisite to this is ensuring that all workers throughout the English lands can vote. This Act will allow all Englishmen to vote regardless of gender or race. We need to show that we are a unified front of all workers of England united by our common goals of socialism and democracy. Every worker's vote should count equally."

SLP_Act_Nepotism:0 "The Nepotism Act"
SLP_Act_Nepotism_desc:0 "Nepotism is a constant plague in English society and government. A lack of oversight has caused it to run everywhere from the union official to the MP. This Act solves this problem by allowing government officials to review appointments to positions. All government appointments must now be approved by a review committee. This should hopefully do a great deal to fight nepotism in English democracy."

SLP_Act_Socialist_Democracy:0 "The Socialist Democracy Act"
SLP_Act_Socialist_Democracy_desc:0 "Socialism must come through democracy. Authoritarianism devolves only into capitalism. Democracy is the voice of the workers across England calling for socialism and change. This Act implements many minor socialist policies throughout the English government, but more importantly, we signal to the hardliners in SLP that democracy is here to stay. Democracy is not a temporary step into socialism; it is a necessary component of socialism."

SLP_Act_Socialist_Education:0 "The Socialist Education Act"
SLP_Act_Socialist_Education_desc:0 "Educating the English commons is a crucial step in reaching a conscious workforce. Workers that are not only skilled but also understand socialist reality and are ready to defend socialism from its enemies. This Act reforms the English school by moving away from teaching traditional values and towards teaching subjects from a socialist point of view. From learning about great socialist thinkers of the past to reading socialist literature, students will become workers who understand why socialism is the only path."

SLP_Act_State_Security:0 "The State Security Act"
SLP_Act_State_Security_desc:0 "There are enemies of socialism all around us. From the Germans to the National Democratic League. We must defend English socialism from all threats, foreign or domestic, and to do this, we must empower the state. This Act massively expands the reach of MI5 and MI6 by increasing their funding and giving a certain degree of freedom from Parliament and the rest of government. The hardliner's power will be used to defend England, democracy, and most of all socialism."

SLP_Act_Anti_Fascism:0 "The Anti-Fascism Act"
SLP_Act_Anti_Fascism_desc:0 "There exists certain organizations that claim to be English nationalists and defend traditional culture. On closer inspection however, it becomes clear that these organizations are just fronts for fascists, and they are often supported by the Patriots of the National Democratic League. This Act would ban these organizations as well as investigate certain fascist leaders and potentially arrest them. This is sure to strike a great blow against the Patriots and fascism."

SLP_Act_Land_Redistribution:0 "The Land Redistribution Act"
SLP_Act_Land_Redistribution_desc:0 "The vast majority of the land of England is owned by a few aristocrats while the common farmer has scarcely anything. This Act redistributes much of the land in Britain from the aristocrats to the farmers. The Act also implements some reforms to land ownership to prevent the rich from accumulating land. Plantations will be split up into smaller farms owned by their workers. This Act would help increase economic efficiency and would give farmers what is rightfully theirs."

SLP_Act_Universal_Healthcare:0 "The Universal Healthcare Act"
SLP_Act_Universal_Healthcare_desc:0 "Universal healthcare is vital to the happiness of the English people. Currently, only the rich can afford proper medical care while the rest of the English workers are stuck with either subpar healthcare care or none at all. This Act creates the National Health Service which will provide medical care to anyone in need. The NHS would be funded by taxes and the English government. We must ensure this passes, for it would be our grandest reform yet."

SLP_Act_Equal_Opportunity:0 "The Equal Opportunity Act"
SLP_Act_Equal_Opportunity_desc:0 "Some people are born with more opportunities than others. This has been true since the dawn of human history, but we will render it false. The first determiner of one's future is their education, and unfortunately, the rich currently are able to get a better education than most others. This Act fixes that by making higher education public and free to anyone. This will hopefully result in an educated workforce as well as setting a precedent that everyone is born equal; their futures are determined only by themselves."

SLP_Act_Peoples_Housing:0 "The People's Housing Act"
SLP_Act_Peoples_Housing_desc:0 "There are many workers in our country with stable employment, yet they live without decent housing. This Act creates new government-funded housing programs that would build new cheap houses to sell to workers in cities from London to Manchester. Workers will be able to live in affordable houses close to their workplaces which will increase efficiency. The people will see that socialism can provide for all their needs."

SLP_Act_National_Wage:0 "The National Wage Act"
SLP_Act_National_Wage_desc:0 "Every man needs a living wage, but unfortunately, we do not always get what we need. Often corporations will exploit workers while giving a tiny portion of what they produce. This Act mandates that companies give all their employees a living wage across England. Everyone from the cashier to the truck driver will be paid a wage high enough to afford a house and a TV. Workers shall accept no more exploitation; they will finally be paid what they are worth."

UE_Act_Anti_Bribery:0 "Anti-Bribery Act"
UE_Act_Anti_Bribery_desc:0 "The Anti-Bribery Act is a piece of legislation focused on preventing and punishing the corruption of government officials of all ranks. Being the first party to really invest in this sort of thing will make the others look somewhat bad in comparison, but the overarching effect of the act will be an increase to national stability. After all, people not having to pay bribes are people more inclined to vote the right way."

UE_Act_Education:0 "Education Act"
UE_Act_Education_desc:0 "The  Education Act is focused around correcting some of the deficiencies in our modern educational system. Namely a grievous overuse of corporal punishment, a lack of adequate teaching staff in many rural schools and increase the number of opportunities available to impoverished or remote students. It will also increase public school funding in general, and give us some more academics."

UE_Act_Fair_Employment:0 "Fair Employment Act"
UE_Act_Fair_Employment_desc:0 "The Fair Employment Act is more accurately described as a series of acts under a single banner. The act in question primarily covers the subject of employer and employee relationships, preventing the firing of employees without compensation unless it is done under specific criteria and banning women from being fire without compensation whilst being pregnant. Additionally, the act offers job opportunities to disabled persons and subsidies for businesses that offer these opportunities of their own will."

UE_Act_Women_Workforce:0 "Women in the Workforce Act"
UE_Act_Women_Workforce_desc:0 "Women are just as important to the national workforce as men are, and The Women Workforce Act puts this motto into law. No longer may any person in England be discriminated against in pay, hiring, firing or promotional opportunities on the grounds of gender, nor are jobs with a specific list of exceptions allowed to be forbidden to women on the grounds of gender."

UE_Act_Labour:0 "Labour Act"
UE_Act_Labour_desc:0 "The Labour Act introduces an improved series of mandatory pensions partially payed for by the government to all workers in the public sector. Whilst workers in the private sector are mandated to have a certain portion of their pay saved in superannuation. Additionally, the act grants unemployment subsidies for workers seeking jobs or are unable to actively work. "

UE_Act_Worker_Health:0 "Workers Health Act"
UE_Act_Worker_Health_desc:0 "The Workers Health Act is the first act of the United England Government which grants healthcare subsidies to all the people of England regardless of age or employment. From this point on, the government will assist in the payment of all necessary surgeries and medications up to a point, and in cases where the surgery is cosmetic or largely so will still subsidise aftercare."

UE_Act_Free_Labour:0 "Free Labour Act"
UE_Act_Free_Labour_desc:0 "The Free Labour Act is a comprehensive series of reforms which guarantee pensions and the right to unemployment subsidies for those injured out out of work. The pension reforms are a guarantee that all persons who are forced into retirement will have sufficient money to live off of, and the unemployment reforms will ensure that those who can work will have incentive to do so."

UE_Act_Anti_Corruption:0 "Anti-Corruption Act"
UE_Act_Anti_Corruption_desc:0 "The Anti-Corruption Act is a piece of legislation which aims to deal with the problem of corrupt local officials, judiciary and the legislature. Though not specifically worded to affect any single party, it is undeniable that the Royal Party takes the brunt of the likely enforcing of this law. Perhaps fittingly, the Corruption Act is retroactive, and will ensure that those who thought themselves secure in prior misdeeds can be brought to trial."

UE_Act_Anti_Extremism:0 "Anti-Extremism Act"
UE_Act_Anti_Extremism_desc:0 "An act which bans fascism in its totality, mot merely as a political force but as an ideology that can be held by the average person, the Anti-extremism Act is a statement of the Macmillan government's intentions towards all extreme right political movements. Some of whom though not officially calling themselves fascists are likely nonetheless to be caught up in the Act's aftereffects."

UE_Act_Protect_Democracy:0 "Protection of Democracy Act"
UE_Act_Protect_Democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is a fragile construct, and one that must be carefully nurtured and protected from harm by overzealous or malicious actors. To the end of stopping harm to our democracy, some restrictions on public meetings and the content of media will be reinforced. Additionally media outlets will have to have supervision on certain release, lest they release material that is too radical for the English public."

UE_Act_Security:0 "Patriot Act"
UE_Act_Security_desc:0 "Is it not the duty of every man to act in the interests of England first and foremost? Well, perhaps not. But the Patriot Act is primarily focused on gathering information on those who believe that the destruction of England is a worthwhile goal. Fascists mostly, but Royal Party sympathisers, leftover HMMLR cells and other vagrant terrorist organisations as well can all be hunted down."

UE_Act_Equal_Vote:0 "Equal Vote Act"
UE_Act_Equal_Vote_desc:0 "The Equal Vote Act is an act which grants the right to vote and the protection of that right to all people born within the confines of England and any constituent nations. Men and women regardless of colour, creed or ideology may vote as they wish and it will be this government's duty to protect that right. This will garner us support across the nation, for those granted this right will be most grateful."

UE_Act_Clear_Parliament:0 "Clear Parliament Act"
UE_Act_Clear_Parliament_desc:0 "The Clear Parliament Act amongst other things covers the day to day running of the state of England, more specifically the right of the people to know more about and view this process. There are other freedoms granted too, removals on the number of persons allowed to be present at political meetings for example, but the main focus of the Act is its transparency reforms."

UE_Act_University:0 "Liberal Education Act"
UE_Act_University_desc:0 "The Liberal Education Act is an act which serves two distinct purposes. First and foremost it addresses the numerous flaws present in the modern education system, granting more funds to public schools and allowing a more diverse range of subjects to be taught by education facilities of all ranks. This act will pave the way for many generations of well educated English citizens."

UE_Act_Free_Press:0 "Free Press Act"
UE_Act_Free_Press_desc:0 "The Free Press Act formally removes the vast majority of restrictions which are currently shouldered by media and newspaper outlets by the government. Chief amongst these is a lessened oversight criteria of what can and cannot be reported on or the nature of said reporting. The English press will now have free reign to do as they wish, and god help the politicians now at their mercy."

UE_Act_Affordable_Education:0 "Affordable Education Act"
UE_Act_Affordable_Education_desc:0 "The Affordable Education Act is a move by the government to increase the number of English youth entering the academic field. Subsidising university courses and higher education, providing further funds to all public educational facilities and encouraging that all students regardless of birth be given equal opportunities to attend tertiary education should they show the aptitude."

UE_Act_Income_Tax:0 "Income Tax Act"
UE_Act_Income_Tax_desc:0 "The Income Tax Act is an act which primarily aims to reduce the affect of the income tax on the English consumers average spending. An economy requires transactions to get moving after all and that of England is no exception. Additionally within the act there are some minor business friendly tax code changes on the subject of holding their assets within England."

UE_Act_Open_Democracy:0 "Open Democracy Act"
UE_Act_Open_Democracy_desc:0 "Why should any man be barred from public political life? Well, unless they were a fascist anyway but then someone of that particular political persuasion is unlikely to work well in our new and modern democracy. Restrictions on public meetings will also be further lessened, why after all should it be the government's business what some group of old fishwives are talking about?"

UE_Act_Free_Education:0 "Free Education Act"
UE_Act_Free_Education_desc:0 "It is important that during the course of education the English student receives a proper and full understanding of the rights and privileges that being in a democratic society gives them. Moreover, this act is an excuse to bring even more funding into the education sector to bring our pool of specialist and educated professional workers back up to our pre-Second World War levels."

UE_Act_Charter:0 "Charter Act"
UE_Act_Charter_desc:0 "The Charter Act is an essential bill of political rights and freedoms enshrined within English society. Amongst other things it forbids the persecution or banning of any political organisation willing to work within a democratic framework. This has allowed the return of the old Labour Party, long banned under the yoke of the Royal Party and then attached to HMMLR, but now resurrected."

RP_Act_Workplace_Management:0 "Workplace Management Act"
RP_Act_Workplace_Management_desc:0 "Unfair practices are costing England money in the corporate world. Nepotism is a big issue, of course. So is the practice of offering extra wages under the books. And, of course, there are plenty of shady deals. We'll put a stop to all that. Any suspicious activities will be made illegal and investigated. And the corporations will have to play by the same rulebook as everyone else."

RP_Act_Business_Protection:0 "Business Protection Act"
RP_Act_Business_Protection_desc:0 "Corporate England needs relief from high taxes that are stifling the economy and crippling innovation. We will provide this relief. Taxes will be reduced on corporations and businesses, allowing the free market to reign once more. Companies may also take advantage of certain tax breaks in industries we wish to see prosper. And there's some other opportunities in the act if they know where to look hard enough."

RP_Act_Housing:0 "Housing Act"
RP_Act_Housing_desc:0 "The poor of England need homes to live in. And at the same time, the number of council homes is rising. If you live in a home, you deserve to be able to buy it. We will change the law so that residents of council housing can buy the homes they live in. This will give many people the chance to achieve home ownership. No longer must they need permission from the civil authority."

RP_Act_New_Healthcare:0 "New Healthcare Act"
RP_Act_New_Healthcare_desc:0 "Our healthcare system needs more funding. We will give it that funding to ensure that people don't end up suffering from lack of funds. We will build new hospitals, and hire new doctors. Modern equipment and ambulances will be provided. And special funds will be marked for taking care of our veterans. We can have a decent quality of life here in England, we just need to work for it."

RP_Act_Hunger:0 "Hunger Act"
RP_Act_Hunger_desc:0 "Across England, people starve. Food is too expensive for them. And when it isn't expensive, it's oftentimes unavailable for people to have. We will give our people bread, and a few other things to put on it as well. Funding for hunger relief programs will be increased. And eligibility requirements will be more lax so that many people can get the relief they need."

RP_Act_Leash:0 "Leash Act"
RP_Act_Leash_desc:0 "We need to get a handle on the opposition. Right now, they are working to destroy everything we have accomplished and fought for. If they are allowed to succeed, everything we have done will be for naught. And that must not happen. We shall clamp down on their activities, and limit the slander they are allowed to put in the press. No matter how unpopular, or how much they howl, it will be done."

RP_Act_Security:0 "Security Act"
RP_Act_Security_desc:0 "Security cameras have been proven effective time and time again. Unfortunately, to put them inside buildings requires the permission of the property owner, and the footage isn't shared with the authorities unless it is requested. We will allow authorities to place security cameras in places that they determine crime may occur, regardless of the owner's permission. This footage is also shared with a central monitoring system. Now, we can gather valuable evidence anywhere."

RP_Act_Anti_Fascism:0 "Anti-Fascism Act"
RP_Act_Anti_Fascism_desc:0 "What some of our opposition really want is a nation free of fascism. And who can blame them? These despots and demagogues cause us nothing but trouble. Let us be rid of them. Fascism will cease to be treated as a legitimate ideology in the eyes of the law. Soon, it will not be in the eyes of the people as well."

RP_Act_Work_Safety:0 "Work Safety Act"
RP_Act_Work_Safety_desc:0 "Companies have been abusing their workers for far too long. What's worse, the government isn't able to do anything about it. Until now. We will gain the right to investigate corporations and their leadership for any unfair practices. If we find any, we will bring down the hammer on them. England's working classes deserve a fair shake, and we will grant them that."

RP_Act_Coal:0 "Coal Act"
RP_Act_Coal_desc:0 "Let's try something new. It's been a common complaint that the coal industry does not work as it is supposed to. And does anyone doubt the reason why? The government is never efficient in anything it sets out to do. Let us sell off the entire business tfo the highest bidder. Then, we will see if they can run it better."

RP_Act_Communications:0 "Communications Act"
RP_Act_Communications_desc:0 "Our telephone system costs too much for the average person to use. There are useless and absurd regulations and requirements that prevent the people of England from being able to pick up the phone. We will change that. Privatizing the phone system will result in lower charges for everyone. Some people may not like it and may lose service, but it is all worth it in the end. After all, the calls are cheaper to make than before."

RP_Act_Aviation:0 "Aviation Act"
RP_Act_Aviation_desc:0 "Expensive tickets. Empty flights. The state of the airline industry of England is a mess. We must come in and change it all. Private airlines will be allowed to enter the market, offering flights for cheaper prices. And when multiple airline companies compete, the flyers win."

RP_Act_Rail_Road:0 "Rails and Roads Act"
RP_Act_Rail_Road_desc:0 "Our roads are clogged by inefficient work projects and expensive expansions. Our rail industry is having similar problems. There is really only one solution: nationalization. Road and rail systems must be broken up and auctioned off to private companies. Once they are involved, they will find out ways to run them for less cost. And the road and rail passengers will thank us."
