 POLITICS_Theodor_Eicke_DESC:0 "Betrayed, forgotten, abandoned. The Hangman has lost his way, but in the name of Germany, a new dawn, no, a new era, will begin.\n\nTheodor Eicke was born in the boiling stew of violence and rage which would spill over into the Great War, where he managed to find himself decorated for his courage along the front lines, even if he managed paychecks behind the lines most of the time. Nevertheless, the failures of democracy crashed hard upon Eicke as he fell into poverty and joblessness with the onset of Weimar's corruption and degeneracy; however, that was all until the National Socialist German Workers' Party came along. From then on, it was blood that earned Eicke his medals, be it the blood of his former commander, Ernst Röhm, or be it the blood of every single degenerate, handicapped, or corrupted subhuman that Eicke witnessed die within the concentration camp.\n\nTo Eicke, the German Reich had finally realized that it was strength that it needed for its people, and allowing any of these affronts to the Aryan image live would be an unacceptable slight against Germany's power. After the war, a lifetime of devotion and desire to please Himmler found him as a strong-and-true official within the Deutsche-SS, as SS-Obergruppenführer Eicke, despite his occasionally rocky relationship with Reinhard Heydrich, realized his true potential in destroying any traces of corruption within the Vaterland.\n\nBut, no. That bastard, Heydrich, that wretched beast ruined it all! He tore Germany apart, and left us all with nothing, leaving the process to transform the Reich into something more pure than ever in tatters! We must do what we can to honor the Reichsführer-SS, and purge Heydrich for his betrayal against the Burgundian System."
 
 POLITICS_ULRIKE_MEINHOF_HGR_DESC:0 "Speer's defeat has shattered the dream of the youth for most. Some, however, are committed. Some dream of a Germany free from the swastika and eagle, of a land of freedom from the Nazi jackboot, and they gathered in the forests outside Essen to continue their fight.\n\nAnd these youthful dreamers have found an unlikely leader: Ulrike Meinhof.\n\nPart of the Student Movement from her youth, she had been attracted to the promise of reform that Albert Speer offered. A Reich free of the Race Laws, the camps, the censorship, a better Germany. But the dream has gone wrong; Speer was gone, the Gang of Four dead, and the SS, through Heydrich, reigns supreme over Germany. But even this fragile order has faltered, with Essen being captured by Theodor Eicke and turned into a second Ordensstaat. Those Speerites who remained underground and waging a shadow war against the SS thought the situation hopeless, until support from an unknown corner arrived. The Revolution was back.\n\nNow the Speerites have seized control of their former capital, Essen, and Meinhof finds herself as part of a wider conflict. Himmler and Heydrich have turned on one another, and the entire Reich has begun to choose sides. She despises Heydrich for what he has done, but Himmler is an even worse monster, as rumors swirl of his true intentions. But the Revolution is not yet over, and once half the SS is dead, its fire shall scorch the half that is left."

 SSL_burgundy_wannabe:0 "부르군트 워너비"
 SSL_burgundy_wannabe_desc:0 "SS-Obergruppenführer Eicke strove throughout his entire career within the Deutsche-SS to remain a loyal butcher for the Aryan cause. Now that Heydrich has betrayed Himmler and the Aryan race in favor of what Eicke sees as decadence and politics, he has taken it upon himself to build within his fiefdom a Burgundian Ordensstaat west of the Rhine."
 
 SSL_burgundian_pawn:0 "힘러의 장기말"
 SSL_burgundian_pawn_desc:0 "Loyal to Himmler until the end, the SS-Ordensstaat Lothringen remains a piece upon the chessboard that Burgundy can move about freely... for now."
