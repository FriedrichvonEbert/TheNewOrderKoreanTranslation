 POLITICS_VALIDI_TUGAN_DESC:0 "The story of Ähmätzäki Välidi Tuġan, or merely Zeki Velidi Togan as was more known abroad, is, in many ways, reflective of the Bashkir history in the 20th century - the formation of identity in the youth, the upheaval in the days of the Russian Civil War, a shameful detachment from the heritage, and, finally, a second chance to prove himself. A descendant of the Muslim clergy, Välidi became known as an accomplished Turkologist scholar and researcher of the Bashkir nation in the later days of the Russian Empire. In those days, he started his political activity on the behalf of the Russian Muslim community and advocate of the Bashkir autonomy.\n\nFollowing the two Russian Revolutions, Välidi became one of the most popular spokesmen for the Bashkir nationalism. Initially cooperating with the Bolsheviks, believing their promises to break the Tsarist prison of the peoples, he later realized that behind their slogans hides the great Russian chauvinism that oppressed its little nations since the emergence of the Tsar's power.  Driven away from Bashkortostan, he continued to struggle against the autocratic Soviet power together with the Basmachi movement in Central Asia, but to no avail. Forced into exile, detached from his roots, Välidi continued his intellectual labor abroad, keeping the Bashkir intellectual tradition alive even far away from the home.\n\nAs the independent Bashkir Islamic Republic was proclaimed in the chaos of the West Russian War, few people expected that Välidi will ever become a relevant person in the chaotic Bashkir politics, if the younger generations could ever remember his name. How wrong were they! The journey from Turkey to the middle of the conflict-ridden Russia was not an easy task. His contributions were acknowledged in his motherland and he found no problem to rise as the Bashkir national leader in the time of the greatest challenge to the Bashkir and Muslim sovereignty in their own lands."

 POLITICS_FAIZRAKHMAN_ZAGAFURANOV_DESC:0 "Faizrakhman Zagafuranovich Zagafuranov has lived in the Bashkir lands for all of his life. As a young man, he began climbing the endless ladder of Soviet bureaucracy but it was too late, for the USSR fell and took the ladder down with it. While a sense of despair took him over with the disaster of the Great Patriotic War, his activism for Bashkir rights paid off in the end, as the Republic of Bashkiria earned its independence in the bloody aftermath of the West Russian War, and Zagafuranov was part of it.\n\nUnfortunately, all good things come to an end, and Bashkiria was crushed once more under the Russian jackboot, or at least until the liberators came from the north. With little regard from what went on far in the south as long as their puppet governments remained, the Anti-Communist Guard had no problem with releasing the nations of the Idel-Ural once more.\n\nZagafuranov seemed a competent administrator and a passionate leader, and so the decision was taken in Arkhangelsk. The official was chosen to be the new President of the Republic of Bashkortostan, and it seems as if he will remain in that position for a long time."
