Paired with smaller, more efficient power plants, submarines are deadlier than ever. "
  submarine_5:0 "Semi-Modern Attack Submarine"
  submarine_5_desc:0 "From the literal bottom of the ocean to the surface of any waters, submarines can go virtually anywhere with impunity. Modern submarines have better survivability. Their propulsion systems have been nearly perfected, meaning subs can move faster underwater without cavitation. Submarine bodies have been enhanced for better y-axis mobility, and weapons technology is nearing its peak. Towed sonar arrays are now a common feature on most submarines, and many even come with their own radar systems."
  submarine_6:0 "Modern Attack Submarine"
  submarine_6_desc:0 "The pinnacle of submarine technology. Operational depths of over 1500 meter. With virtually unlimited endurance, only limited by fresh food and water on board, these submarines are cutting edge in every way. Torpedoes with ranges of nearly 40 kilometers and unmatched detection systems means unwary ships could be hit without any warnings, any time, anywhere. With state of the art technology, these boats are the best trade indirection weapons we have at our disposal. "
