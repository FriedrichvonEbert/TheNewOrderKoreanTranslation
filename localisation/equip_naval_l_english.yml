  ship_hull_heavy_6_desc:0 "A symbol of wealth and of stubbornness, the battleship of the 90's is a terror at sea like none other, incorporating such a range of technology as to be nigh invincible from conventional attacks. Perhaps it is for the best that it is not seriously expected to fight in a war."
 ### Battleship ###

 ### Carrier ###
  ship_hull_carrier:0 "항공모함"
  ship_hull_carrier_desc:0 "Aircraft carriers are ships entirely devoted to hangars and flight decks, using onboard planes for both attack and defense. For any nation wealthy enough to field them, they form the core of a modern navy, providing versatile firepower and excellent power-projection capabilities."
 
  ship_hull_carrier_1:1 "Early Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The dawn of the carrier was the Second World War, and those which survived it are old but dangerous beasts nonetheless. Few expect those that remain to see combat and survive however."
  ship_hull_carrier_2:1 "Basic Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "The 50's were an age of experimentation for the proponents of carrier-based warfare. Improvements and redesigns mark the carriers of this era as more prototypes than weapons in and of themselves."
  ship_hull_carrier_3:1 "Improved Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the tensions of the world rising, the 60's mark an increase in the number of carriers built worldwide, ones without the weaknesses of their ancestors. These vessels will be the backbone of any war fought at sea."

  ship_hull_submarine_1:1 "Early Attack Submarine Hull"
  ship_hull_submarine_1_desc:0 "Though WWI saw the first widespread use of submarines in naval warfare, WWII was where they truly showed their effectiveness, destroying vast swathes of merchant ships and enemy naval vessels alike. However, the submarines that fought in that conflict are now long out of date."
  ship_hull_submarine_2:1 "Basic Attack Submarine Hull"
  ship_hull_submarine_2_desc:0 "Most new attack submarines of the 50's were incremental improvements on late-WWII designs, but they set the stage for important changes down the line; for example, the first submarine cruise-missile launch systems were designed during this period."
  ship_hull_submarine_3:1 "Improved Attack Submarine Hull"
  ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "The first nuclear-powered submarines entered service in the late 50's and early 60's, and completely upended the paradigm of submarine warfare. At the same time, submarine-launched ballistic missiles began to rise to prominence; the combination of the two technologies created what the United States called SSBNs."
  ship_hull_submarine_4:1 "Advanced Attack Submarine Hull"
  ship_hull_submarine_4_desc:0 "The 70's saw a relative lull in submarine development as technological focus shifted to SLBMs; however, the drive to carry more powerful and longer-range missiles did lead to many submarines of the era being retrofitted or upgraded."
