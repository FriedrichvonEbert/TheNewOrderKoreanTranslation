The London Uprising had started on a Monday, his old dog had died on a Monday, and now on a Monday afternoon he was having to report that he might have discovered a plot to blow up the King at the speech the newspapers were harping on about.\n\nHe scowled. It had to be him, didn't it, and when he'd figured out the little thief had been hiding something he hadn't delegated or passed it on - no, he'd done the interrogation hisself. It was his job to protect the people of London, wasn't it, and something like blowing up the King - well, O'Flaherty didn't exactly know what the politicians would call it, but his dad might have referred to it as a bloody bad time all around.\n\nBut, on the bright side, O'Flaherty might get some overtime pay out of the whole affair, with pay no less. And possibly a promotion too for discovering it. A promotion might pay quite a few quid extra, and he could get his girls some of those nice dolls he saw in the fancy toy stores for Christmas. Or maybe get Martha a going-out dress to replace the one she'd bought for the honeymoon? Hell, he could grab a proper fishing boat, if a small one, on a Chief Inspector's pay.\n\nTim O'Flaherty sent in the report with a bit more vigor than he had initially intended."

Why on earth had he agreed to it? He knew he wasn't popular, even compared to the low point following the end of the war. Wasn't that an achievement - right alongside being the first King in 400 years to rule only England? The Prime Minister had sent him a letter of recommended topics, but Edward felt they were a bit too obtuse. Supporting the government was all well and good, but there was such a thing as brown-nosing.\n\nPerhaps he should ask Wallis? She had been terribly depressed not to be able to visit America for two decades, perhaps a bit of involvement in the government process might cheer her up? But as he glanced at his beloved wife's face Edward knew he couldn't do it, she would worry and fret and make the whole thing so much harder on herself than it ought to be.\n\nWhat Edward was worried about most, however, was not his wife or the Prime Minister, but that band of terrorists loyal to his niece in Canada. 'Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance' - what tosh. But they were very real, and very dangerous. It was one thing to know that men like the madman Stirling or the traitorous communist Bill Alexander were out there; it was quite another to know that some shadowy figure had united them under a common cause - to end his miserable reign.\n\nLater that evening, as he went to sleep with a heart roiled by sadness and anger, he looked out of the window, wishing things had gone differently all those years ago."

We have managed increasingly public attacks on the government to show the people that they do not have to live in the shadows anymore. Now, it is time to strike at the heart of this corrupted England.\n\nAfter a brief radio message, "With a monarch's voice," the first uprisings began. York was the first to fall. After an assault on the army base and brief skirmish with the police force, our troops declared on public radio that a new Free England would be formed from the ashes of the old regime. Other towns in the North were quick to follow. Fighting in the Midlands and the South continues as we seek to break the hold of the government on those regions. Our preparations will prove critical in the coming days as we seek to secure territory for the war.\n\nWe must also look abroad to our allies, both across the Atlantic and across the Channel. War makes for strange bedfellows, and we must embrace them if we are to stand a chance at winning this war. We are not as well armed as either the Cornwall garrison or the government troops, but with our militias and weapons caches, we should be able to match them in the field until help arrives.\n\nOne day, we will again hold Parliament in Westminster, and serve the people of England as we bring our country back from the fascist abyss. We can then assert ourselves in the world as a true beacon of freedom and reunite our Isles. And never again will our flags be lowered and our country defiled, for Britons shall never be slaves!"

ENG_HMMLRECW.3.desc:0 "Even before the German Civil War broke out, there had been an increasing number of "incidents" designed to provoke our police or break down law and order in England. Evidently, the German Civil War only escalated the depravity of terrorists carrying out these acts, as they have grown more brazen and bold in their attempts to undermine our government.\n\nWe thought that we might be able to keep things under control. We thought that these incidents, however frequent, would not spiral into the open. We thought that we could avoid the coming war.\n\nWe were spectacularly wrong.\n\nToday, after a brief radio message, a general uprising amongst the population and various militia units has taken place. The first shots were fired in York, as armed and organized partisans massacred the local garrison and declared themselves the governing authority. Further atrocious incidents have conglomerated the partisans' hold on their "Free England".\n\nOur initial response has been chaotic, and disorganization is rampant among our divisions. The only advantage we have is that the forces of our opposition are likely just as disorganized. We must act quickly to consolidate our hold on as many areas as possible. Whatever assistance we can get from our allies, reluctant and otherwise, must be called upon, NOW. Our enemies will likely do the same.\n\nThe North has always been a hotbed support for HMMLR, and so it is likely that resistance will be strongest there. We may have to give up some territory to save the rest. The Midlands are wavering, and we will have to see which way the tide turns there. We must hold London, as the seat of government and our legitimacy. Losing it would be a devastating blow to our side.\n\nWe must tread carefully as we seek to squash this rebellion. The communists and socialists that have risen against us would see England turned into a wasteland rather than continuing cooperation with the Germans. We will hold them back and return England safely to stability and peace under our leadership, for the good of all."

They probably heard that Stirling had escaped. He scoffed and waved his hands to the group behind him. They had been militarists who had escaped being captured by the Collaborators, and they had joined Stirling to flee to Scotland. They scanned the path that divided their path to freedom. Across the hill were a few sheep that had been grazing on the grass. To the Collaborator soldiers who patrolled this section, it was normal. However, behind the hill were Scottish infantry battalions.\n\nEarlier that day, the Scottish government had been contacted by David Stirling, using members of the SAS who had been sent to Scotland. While the government had been opposed to letting in a possible criminal into the country, they had decided to go for it. Stirling was Scottish after all. They decided on a time when he would cross the border and meet Scottish soldiers, who would then help them cross the border into Scotland. Once they would be across, they would be offered asylum in Scotland, protected from the Collaborators.\n\nStirling pulled something out of his bag. A clicker, they had used them twenty odd years ago in Africa. The soldiers on patrol had been out of earshot it seems. He clicked it a few times, hoping to hear a response from the border. Stirling heard the clicks and then the flash. He smiled, and motioned to the group behind him. Stirling looked one more time and dashed across the path. On the fence he was met by three Scottish soldiers who had made a hole in the fence. The Scottish soldiers got them through the hole. Once the last militarist was inside Scotland, the soldiers moved away and brought Stirling and his militarists behind the hill. One of the Scottish soldiers then shook Stirlings hand."

It seems they could have been possibly assisted by the Scots. As Stirling is Scottish himself. We found a hole cut in a fence near the border, it also seems that tank treads had been found as well across the border. It seemed as if Stirling was caught, the Scots would fight to the end to rescue him." The captain replied to the colonel. The colonel fiddled with his thumbs before responding, thinking about a possible solution.\n\n"Well, we can try the diplomatic approach can we? It may be possible to threaten the Scots into bringing Stirling back to England to be tried." The colonel replied and shrugged, as did the captain.

Instead they sent us a letter telling us to fuck ourselves." The colonel gave Marcus the paper, before grumbling something else about Stirling.\n\nAs Marcus read the paper, he was surprised. The Scots had seemed to tell them to bugger off when it came to the idea of sending Stirling back. So much for diplomacy thought Marcus as he read the rest.

"Communications with our men were a constant difficulty throughout the war. There were many troubles with coordination and awareness, and we performed poorly because of it.

There had been considerable trouble in the area recently, but this did not obscure the scars of war still underneath the surface. Buildings were still burnt, the holes were still in the ground, and there were still bullets embedded in the walls of Folkestone.\n\n"Outside the city, on my way to Dover, I saw a group of workers on the beach. A German bomb had been uncovered, I was told, and they were trying to dispose of it. As I watched them work, my gaze was drawn across the ocean. There was Calais, now under perpetual occupation by Herr Himmler's SS. And at that time, I realized two fundamental truths; the invasion was an abuse that England will never forget, yet the chance of another one, possibly worse, was still high.\n\n"Every once and awhile, I've heard people say that England is on the way out. That we are no longer capable of standing up for ourselves. Nonsense. This is a great country, one that has a superb record of achievement of every kind. We have no need to fear temporary setbacks. Britain was great, and it can be great, provided we close ranks and stand together.""

ENG_mac.4.t:0 "Report on Failings of British Defenses in 1943, Abstract"
ENG_mac.4.desc:0 "At the request of the Prime Minister, we have been tasked with conducting an investigation into the failings of the British Military during the 1943 invasion. This commission, led by General Carver, enlisted the support of the Public Record Office, the Historical Records Commission, and RMA Sandhurst. After much study, several critical failings have been reported by the commission:\n\n1. In the crucial initial hours of the invasion, there was a massive organizational breakdown, with many home guard units being overwhelmed and unable to provide an effective defense. Manpower had been stretched thin, and what few units there were on coastal defence were unable to stand their ground.\n\n2. British defensive fortifications were inadequate and lackluster. A few blockhouses were in place, but they were scarcely enough to hold the enemy back and provide our forces with meaningful cover. A lack of fortified positions meant English forces had few places to hold and launch counter-attacks from.\n\n3. The Royal Air Force was unable to provide a degree of arial protection against the Luftwaffe. The organization was unable to keep up with German aircraft production or pilot training. Other ways of mitigating this advantage were not available, leading to effective German ground support and attacks against infrastructure.\n\nWe have not included in this report much analysis of naval failings, as those have been well documented elsewhere. This report is primarily for strategic and tactical problems with the Army and RAF. We will say, however, that a lack of intelligence and early warning systems played a part in the battle, especially in regards to the German deception in Operation Herbstreise."

ENG_mac.5.t:0 "Conclusions of the Sandhurst Exercise"
ENG_mac.5.desc:0 "In summary, the war game ended in a English victory, by a vote of 6-0 from the umpires. The Germans were limited in the areas they could invade without access to the French coast, and were forced to conduct operations on the eastern shore of England. The English team had expected this and were able to deploy their units in the area.\n\nThis ended up giving them the crucial advantage, as they were able to hold onto the ports and prevent the Germans from gaining them. Without an avenue for resupply, the German beachheads were pushed back into the sea, with a great loss of men and materiel. There were, however, some difficulties for the English that should not be discounted:\n\n1. German armor provided a level of hardness to the invasion that was difficult to overcome. It was responsible for most of Germany's early gains in the exercise. England was unable to counter these tanks, and oftentimes lost engagements to them. Only the lack of supply eventually allowed England to defeat the panzer divisions.\n\n2. Germany started the exercise with air superiority, and maintained it throughout the game. This made any English operation difficult, and was responsible for prolonging the German defense. England lacked the ability to counter this advantage."

ENG_mac.21.t:0 "The State of the Royal Navy, Conclusion"
ENG_mac.21.desc:0 "It is obvious that the Royal Navy is in dire shape and in no way prepared for a modern conflict. On the surface, the Royal Navy comprises a respectable number of vessels, more than many other countries, and backed up by a decent dockyard base. What this hides, however, is an aged navy in no way able to compete with any modern fleet.\n\nThe major vessels of the Royal Navy are not really impressive. Battleships like the HMS Howe are relegated to tasks like shore bombardment and are functionally obsolete in naval combat. The pride of the fleet, HMS Implacable, is a relic of the Second World War, relying on a small flight of prop-driven aircraft to provide air support.\n\nScreening vessels are where the navy derives most of its strength. Even there, the destroyers are mostly out of date, with a few exceptions. The main armaments, such as torpedoes and cannons, are ancient. The lack of modern anti-aircraft, a necessity, is also extremely concerning. Most alarmingly, our fleet lacks proper ASW radar and weaponry, making our destroyers next to useless in a potential conflict.\n\nOur submarine fleet is small, obsolete, and ineffective. Comprising only a few vessels, it has been mothballed since the Second World War, and woefully obsolete. Other submarines are better in nearly every respect, and so will enemy ASW ships.\n\nIt is clear an upgrade is in order, with newer ships with modern armament needing to be produced. If we wish to keep these ships, they need to be modernized as well. And a complete rebuilding of the fleet air arm must also take place. Only by massive effort can we hope the Royal Navy to regain some semblance of her former strength."

ENG_mac.22.t:0 "England's Charter"
ENG_mac.22.desc:0 "The British Navy was once the strongest and largest in the world. Dominating the world since the age of sail, the navy had been a legendary and terrifying force. Every man could recall the names and heroism of Drake, Nelson, and Cook. Memories of the HMS Victory still stirred the hearts, and the name HMS Dreadnought still would deliver chills to some. Like the sun never setting on the British Empire, there was nary an ocean in the world where the British Fleet would not be patrolling the waves.\n\nThen, the war happened. What had once terrified the world was on the bottom of the ocean, laid low by bombs or torpedoes. Peace was more devastating. Many ships now flew under different flags, those of Scotland, the Commonwealth, the OFN, all now independent of London. The vanquishers of the British fleet scrapped what ships left that had been deemed a threat, and mothballed the rest so England would never have its fabled weapon again.\n\nBut this was a new era. Those in London today would not be cowed by Teutonic threats. Now, they would make sure no enemy force would land on England again and subjugate the people of the isle. In shipyards across the nation, people lined up to build what the occupiers had said they could not. No agreement made under durress with the Nazi beast would be respected now.\n\nThousands of shipyard workers took their tools up again and marched into the dockyards. Every drydock would have a hull in it, and if it didn't, there would be one. Looking at the first ship sailing out of the historic dockyard of Portsmouth, even those with the faintest memories of the British Empire could hardly suppress their smiles at the memory of the line "Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.""

The definition of a defensive position was a foxhole, and a fortified position was a really deep foxhole. Today, Sergeant Booth's squad is outfitted with machine guns and modern rifles. They also are satisfied with their concrete position overlooking Margate.\n\nPetty Officer Powell's first assignment was in a rusting submarine from the Second World War. It looked like it belonged at the bottom of the ocean, and there were fears that it would really stay there next dive. Powell no longer needs to loathe his assignment, however. He now is quite comfortable on his new submarine, one that is considerably faster, armed, and more habitable than his original posting.\n\nFlight Sergeant Foster didn't think he would be in any sort of Royal Air Force if he joined the military. Eveb if he did, he fully expected to be flying prop-driven aircraft. He believed that he would end up in the Army like everyone else. Well, life's funny, sometimes. He now flies a modern jet fighter, and can claim to be a pilot like his father was back in the war.\n\nAll across Britain, there are men like Booth, Powell, and Foster. Men of the British Armed Forces, granted the ability to be far more effective and strong than they thought possible. No longer is it a token force. It is an efficient force, a powerful force, and a force ready to stand up to anyone who wants to crush the isle underneath their jackboot."

My government wishes to discuss an issue of great importance with a representative of the United States. I immediately suggested that you should be the one we talk with. It is a deal that could radically transform the alignment of Western Europe in this Cold War. If you are interested, come to Rome immediately and contact our embassy there.

We also recognize the United States and the OFN wish to gain a foothold in Europe and gain access to the North Sea.\n\nI am therefore authorized on behalf of His Majesty to propose the following deal. England will offer the United States the ability to station troops within its borders. The American armed forces will be allowed to conduct operations from our territory, and to receive supplies as well. The United States Navy will also be granted the ability to resupply and rearm in English ports.\n\nIn return, England will be paid for these rights in regular shipments of American equipment, which we will use to arm ourselves against foreign aggression. We also wish to enter a technology sharing agreement, where we can study American technological developments and use them for our own needs.\n\nI sincerely hope you consider this agreement to be fair.

He stood next to the Captain, enjoying an American breakfast of bacon, eggs, pancakes, and coffee. "How many ships did you say are in this group, Captain?" he asked.\n\n"The Dewey's got a heavy cruiser with her for more punch, like the Providence," the captain said, pointing. "We have a fleet of seven destroyers and corvettes with us today, mostly for ASW and AA protection. But the real striking power is in the aircraft. A good air arm is worth way more than a battleship." The Captain was willing to share a lot of information about the fleet. Mostly because the Americans figured the Japanese were watching this exercise anyway. They were meant to.\n\n"And, it's typical for a carrier to operate in a strike group like this alone?\n\n"The Captain looked at him and said "you get a big enough air wing, you can do most anything with a carrier.

ENG_mac.117.desc:0 "Hello there! I'm Parker Macdonald, from the Embassy. I'm just out here getting a feel for the general mood of Germania towards us. There's a large amount of misconceptions that need to be corrected. There isn't as much animosity in England towards the Pakt as you may think. We're still dedicated to a friendly relationship with you.\n\nEngland still relies on Germany for its trade, about as much as it did before the civil war. And I'm sure there's a large number of German businesses that rely on us as well. Our programs to increase domestic production? Doesn't everyone want to produce as much as possible in their own country? And we have to advance, or we get left behind. The OFN? Well, it's just an open option that we use to get things we absolutely can't from the Pakt. A mere trifle, really!\n\nWe really aren't in the business of Pakt busting right now. England isn't going to stand up to you, and if I may confide in you for a moment, we really have no way to. We know you are the major power on the continent, and we know we can't compete, and we're just fine if we leave each other alone.\n\nI mean, good relations between England and Germany is what we want, correct? We're better off together. If not, it would be unfortunate, and may cause us to go seeking out other powers. Good relations, in my view, will keep England where it is now in relation to the Pakt. Otherwise, if things sour, there may be an unfortunate situation, one which may very well cause us to seek aid from other sources.\n\nWell, good to meet you. I have to go, unfortunately. There's a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce I'm scheduled to speak at. Let's keep in touch! Hope we meet again sometime."

Rover will find these answers, and soon be able to build a vehicle with all the qualities of this new Volkswagen.\n\nAcross England, similar activities are going on. Everyone wants to learn how to make all the items coming out of Germany. Soon, England will be able to make all of these products itself. It won't need German experts either.

He'd never bought the ambassador's claims that it would propel him into a future higher up in the party, but a job was a job.\n\nStanding guard meant that Hans Albert was able to get something of an understanding of the ordinary Englishman that even the diplomats lacked. He got to see how they reacted to the Reich welcoming England back into the civilised world. To his confusion however, when looking at the German Embassy very few of the English smiled. Some scowled, some cursed, none would go far as to spit whilst men with guns were around though. Hans simply couldn't understand why they felt that way though. Germany was a bulwark against bolshevism and American puppetry, could the English not see that? What was a war two decades gone worth anyway?\n\nStill, he would not be lying as he watched a woman cross to the opposite side of the street rather than walk in front of the Embassy, that he didn't feel a bit unnerved by the whole spectacle."

They aren't ready, after all, and what they did was tantamount to war between us and them.\"\n\nThe Ambassador shook his head. \"I don't think that's going to happen.

And it wasn't like he hadn't looked it over before the address to parliament.\n\nMacmillan sighed. The thought of working with the Germans had been anathema to him. The well documented problems United England had with the Reich were well known. They had dropped a bomb in this very chamber, hadn't they? And on a personal note, they had tried to kill Macmillan. Damn nearly succeeded as well at the Somme, making him play dead in a shell hole for half a day then making him spend months on crutches afterwards.\n\nAnd yet, this was necessary. If England was to have a peaceful future, they had to get on Germany's good side. Convince them England wouldn't be a problem. Tell them England would not be a threat against their horrific ambitions for the world. And sweeten the deal with a trade offer. Why not be friends anyway? England had nothing more to need from the Reich, and a war would certainly result in thousands of dead Germans.\n\nThe crowd applauded. Some boos, but what could one expect in the House of Commons?

They were fascists afterall, the Prime Minister would rather take any other course of action than having to bargain with such villains.\n\nThe real plan was for a military invasion of the peninsula, the negotiations would only ever be used as a distraction. Then, when the time was right, the army would push, seizing back England's rightful land.\n\nYet there Macmillan sat, baldfaced, waiting for the German response.

One order to his generals and the attack would begin, despite all the time he is taking the Germans may still be none the wiser.

This development has only made Macmillan more anxious of arousing German suspicion.\n\nAlthough, to his great relief, the army has reported back to the government that tanks have arrived at the border and are ready to drive into Cornwall. While the army would still want more time to completely prepare, they are now more ready for the attack than before. The overall chance of succeeding is higher and with incessant fears eating away at Macmillan's mind, the order to attack may very well be given."

Soon the unprepared German lines were broken and a mad dash toward Plymouth followed.\n\nThe English soldiers, with the help of several pieces of indispensable armor, moved in to cut off any remnants of the garrison that were retreating toward the port. Yet the resistance from within the port itself was immense and the English had to cut their losses and leave Plymouth in the hands of the Germans.\n\nAt least the rest of Cornwall was under their control, and what was left of the feared garrison now cowered inside a port."

In the end the garrison was forced back into the Port of Plymouth, where all that remains of the garrison remains.\n\nGermany will have to accept the reality that Cornwall is now back under the control of its rightful English owners. The existence of the final pocket of German troops in Plymouth may be a thorn in our side in the future, but now we can celebrate.\n\nThe Cornish people are liberated and, for once, we have directly put the Germans on the retreat."

This may become a greater issue as our advance has strayed far from its original plan.\n\nEnglish soldiers pressed forward in a disorganized manner, owing to the preemptive nature of the call to push forward. However, with the additional support of some crucial pieces of armor the early stages of the attack appeared to have been a moderate success.\n\nVictory still hangs in the balance, either side could triumph, especially if more German troops arrive and the English attack stalls.

He then proceeded to berate him for his lack of tact, foresight and nerve. Montgomery knew this invasion would be nigh on impossible without the necessary time to prepare.\n\nHowever, he could not undo an order, he would have to do what every other soldier must and get on with it."

Bernhard Montgommery had come to the conclusion that failure was, at this point, inevitable.

Our chief advisors have been greatly divided and even bewildered from this recent request for weaponry. Having a friend in what was once a core part of the Reichspakt would be the beginning of a sea change in Europe, but it would cost us a fair amount of equipment (and we can't even be sure MacMillan wants to deepen relations with us).

Men may not have faith in many things after all that has befallen England in these years, but they have faith in Macmillan because he's dragged them out of hell before.\n\nThe smaller portion of the party are led by Reginald Maudling, the "Liberals". Unlike the Macmillanists, the Liberals are loyal to the idea of democracy rather than to a single person.

And indeed, England has been soaked in more blood this century than ever before. But we must defend our way of life once more from those who would seek to destroy it. This country will make a stand once again against foreign invasion. Scarcely a man believes that peace is so sweet that it is worth the price of chains and slavery.

It was only fitting, they thought, to pay homage to those who had died keeping the country free, now that the last bastion of German occupation had been eliminated.\n\nAs they walked down past the statue of Robert Clive between the Foreign Office and the Revenue and Customs building, a few Londoners who were walking past were astonished to see the Prime Minister walking by with a few police escorting them. They were equally astonished when he told them Cornwall was English once again. Maudling was surprised by the subdued initial reaction, but Macmillan assured him that the people who heard Lloyd George announcing from his window the Great War would end in a few hours probably were confused as well.\n\nOnce again, Macmillan's instincts proved correct, for when they arrived at the memorial, people had begun to hear about it. Bicycle commuters stopped to shake the PM's hand and tell him \"job well done.\" Even the police officers who were on patrol of the park left their routes to congratulate Maudling.\n\nAs they walked back, a small entourage formed, cheering Maudling on, singing patriotic songs, and making rude remarks about the Germans and, occasionally, the head of the Shadow Cabinet. When they made it back to Number 10, a crowd was already waiting for them, and so were plenty of press. As they went inside, Maudling waved to the cheering crowd that was ever growing, while Macmillan rebuffed the media's questions by saying they could expect a complete address from the Prime Minister shortly.\n\nMacmillan and Maudling were later told by Scotland Yard not to do something so risky again. The crowds grew too large, too fast. But that risk had been accounted for by both the PM and his loyal assistant. And they felt this moment of triumph had been richly deserved."

We need to be able to focus our efforts on the place where our programs can do the most good.\n\nThe North was the hardest hit, even before the war. It will take some convincing, as the North was a hotbed of resistance prior to the war, but no small part of that resistance was due to a lack of economic programs centered around this poorest region. Showing that the government is willing to make amends for past omissions might go a long way towards shoring up our economy and national unity. It is risky, but the rewards could be very valuable.\n\nThe Midlands are primarily agricultural, and so our program of industrialization would present a significant change in the overall lifestyle of the region. However, it would also show our commitment to an oft-forgotten region and stamp down Stirlingite sympathies among the population.\n\nThe South has always been the richest region, owing in no small part to a London-centered government. It has also been the least turbulent region and was a bulwark of the government during the English Civil War. Our efforts here would be most likely to succeed and would certainly benefit the government's standing with the upper classes.

The legislation was nothing new - indeed, it was long overdue. Small, token reforms to England's healthcare and labor regulations, to prove that the government could actually look after the people, now that the specter of German intervention in English politics was gone.\n\nWas it going to be enough to convince the people that United England had their interests in mind? On its own, perhaps not. But in the post-Civil War political landscape, Macmillan was the best the people were going to get - the only one who knew Westminster inside and out, who could deliver the promised, better future for England.

Now Maudling had to sell it to Parliament, and to the people. He had no doubt that, if implemented fully, his plan would transform England, freeing it from two decades of stagnation. If nothing else, the numbers would look impressive, coming from a low base.\n\nBut the English people would see a country rebuilt from ashes, the return of dignified work, and the restoration of prosperity.

Whenever the subject was brought up, Harold's expression would grow fearsome, his words terrifying and dictatorial. Thankfully, Maudling had thus far kept the Chairmen's reactionary authoritarianism in check, but the fascists were still a problem and he was going to eliminate them.\n\nOrders went out. Find the blackshirts in the government, wherever they were. Get their names, and their positions. If they were in parliament or any public office, Maudling needed to know about it.\n\nAnd they would be sent to him.\n\nMaudling was going to exterminate the menace as Mac wanted to.

Fifteen years? That's quite an accomplishment. And you kept your seat since before the civil war. I do so wonder how you were so fortunate as to have gotten the seat. Would it be rude to wonder if it might have been that the Germans knew you from your affiliation with Mosely back in the thirties? Could it have been that? You do know the old pre-war government kept tabs on that sort of thing, didn't you? We have the MI5 files.\n\nMister Richardson, let's stop beating around the bush. You're a fascist. You worked with fascists. And you were probably as much a traitor to the old government as you are to mine. But I'm giving you a chance. You renounce your affiliations now, and work with me, and everything will be fine, nobody has to know. Otherwise you'll just have to be sent to a place that appreciates your sentiments, and I dare say you'll be staying there for a very long time. So what will it be, Mister Richardson?\n\nOh, very good sir, a wise choice, Mister Richardson. Good day. And could you ask the next man to come in, please?\""

One which had suited him well. But it could be more. A lot more. There were still vestigial structures from the Royal Party reformist wing in there.

The Prime Minister would write to them, and demand their immediate resignations. They were getting old, and new people would need to replace them. People that were more liberal than their predecessors. And more in tune with what the Prime Minister wanted.\n\nThe risks were incalculable.

For the longest time, it was a one-party state only catering to the elites and the rich. It was highly regressive in pretty much every aspect. And the furthest left was Maudling and the UE party.\n\nBut that was only the government. Maudling long knew the government wasn't representative. And he felt there were a number of people who were significantly more left than the government currently represented. So he made the poll.\n\nHe was correct. There were a great number of voters who weren't quite socialists, but they weren't represented in parliament either. That opened up an enormous opportunity.

For a United England Party, it really was anything but.\n\nBut not in voting. Every time a bill needed to be passed by the PM, both sides got together and passed it. They still sat in the same benches. And they would still identify themselves with the party label.\n\n\This peculiar situation had one explanation. Despite their hatred of each other, there still was a common goal between them. Both sides were close to a democratic England.

Sure, they try to put on a respectable face today, but we know what they really think. And what they have done. From the early days of the occupation, to Cable Street, to the Civil War, even to last week.\n\nWe'll start gathering all the dirt we can find on the Royal Party. Records, private conversations, MI5 files, everything. Then, we reveal all of it to the public.

It would be a full press offensive.\n\nThere was plenty of nasty information found about the Royal Party. Did anyone expect there to not be? You don't collaborate with the Nazis for twenty years without doing some despicable things. And being the unashamed party of the rich and the elite wasn't exactly a populist move. Then, there were the damned lies they had told. It had all been gathered into a series of reports that were about to go out after this speech.\n\nMaudling checked it again, making sure it was good.

Highly important things that would ensure a Democracy would truly exist in England. And he had the paperwork to do so right here. He took it out and went to work.\n\nA few pages, and a few signatures. That's all it took. Now, there were a lot fewer restrictions on political organizations.

The one man in the Royal Party with the balls to stand up to the rest of the organization. The independent who dragged the island kicking and screaming from a single-party oligarchy to a free democracy. And yet...the man who had to rely on Macmillan's protection for most of the time in parliament. The man who served as the shadowmaster's puppet for most of his time as PM. And the man who betrayed his friends in the war, and the man who betrayed his party after that. Was it really worth the cost?\n\nBut did it matter? What's done was done. And one couldn't argue with the results. They had the right to criticize him for what he did now. The restrictions on speech were lifted, after all.

In the privacy of her mind she'd taken to call them the "blue" and "black" options. The blue telephone to the Americans would have several distinct advantages, for a start it would be an immediate and needed contact point between London and Washington which simply didn't exist, and if the Reich ever became hostile would most certainly need to exist. But the Americans were fickle, one wrong administration and the entire effort of bringing them over to her point of view could be rendered naught.\n\nThe black telephone did not possess this restriction. The Fuhrer was the Fuhrer, and nobody would be replacing him any time soon. More to the point, to not coddle the Germans at least somewhat could be far more dangerous than doing the same to the Americans.

Why, that would ruin the country, such recklessness would be a grave threat to-"\n\n"I have no such intentions, we only need the Americans to think I do, that way we can force more concessions out of them and the more concessions we get the stronger our position becomes.

With new advancements in the English military, she believes her nation is now impervious to enemy attack, and the desire of the world to court it speaks to its strength.\n\nOutsiders were more skeptical, with the claim being regarded as \"dubious\" by the Brookings Institution. In a report, they claim it is unlikely a nation with a limited sphere of influence outside its own borders like England could call itself a global player, especially since it lacked the hallmarks of other superpowers, such as nuclear weaponry. They also report England's diplomatic relations are merely a result of them holding a valuable geopolitical position, and not because they are respected by foreign powers.

Her political maneuverings were for the best of the party, and, more importantly, for her own gain. She rose.\n\n"I do agree with the Honourable Gentleman in that many new and fresh faces are to be seen in the RP today, and I believe that to be a good thing, as we cannot forever have the same members representing our districts.

The order that stood was that the Populace dwelled at the bottom, the Elite above them, and her above even the richest of the remaining Oligarchs. What many didn't understand, though, was that the Populace could not be ignored. Of course, the Elite held their wealth and riches, but Margaret knew that the loyalty of the Populace was paramount for a successful nation. After all, this same Populace had almost overthrown the government, not even a decade ago. While reducing people into basic groups was all well and good, she knew that she couldn't target the Populace as one group. Once one looked closer at the Populace, they would find that there stood not just one approachable Stallion, but two unwieldy foals in need of coaxing; the Average and the Poor.\n\n"The Average Man," as many called them, was a fanciful way of referring to the Middle Class. The Middle Class, a group of those who weren't rich or poor, but a group instead made up of the absolute middle of society. The Average Man doesn't sleep within a slum, nor do they sleep inside of a Manor. They may have some luxuries, and lack many more, but they do hold something that many lack: Hope. This Hope is a resource that can be mobilised, something that can be used to ensure the solidified support of the most average men.\n\nWhile the Middle Class has Hope, the Poor have numbers. The most prolific group, the poor live in varying levels of squalor, from the streets to shacks. While not in possession of the exploitable aspirations of the Middle Class, the armies of impoverished men that roam England have an even more caterable desire: survival. While the Middle Class desire to become Elites, the Poor simply want decent lives, and that is something that Margaret knew she could exploit.

In a way, she sat at a crossroads between two avenues of support, both valid, if not equally so.\n\nBefore she departed for the day, she had received piles of requests from different papers, radio shows, and television broadcasts to grace them with her presence. She was quite good at the media game, she knew how to dominate it. A few solid quips in the right places would cause even the most steadfast listener to metaphorically swoon at the call of her voice, the witty construction of words whipping her opponents in a graceful spectacle. While there are plentiful people who would enjoy hearing the Lady speak over the airwaves, or analyse her phrases in the papers, countless more desire to feel her presence in person.\n\nIn fact, she had received equal amounts of requests for public speeches, rallies across England where she would exhibit the soft touch of the Iron Lady. Margaret knew that people, on a deep and base level, responded better to a face that they had seen in person. She had enough of a security detail that such encounters wouldn't be a danger to her personal safety, though portraying it in that fashion would make her seem even braver and greater for it, what this all came down to was Man's greatest and oldest enemy: Time.

Apparently, in the view of the general who had compiled the report, it was a miracle the loyalists won at all. They suffered from "a drastic lack of modern, quality equipment" and "great difficulty in procuring munitions". Thatcher couldn't believe what she was reading: most generals claimed that the loyalist army was well equipped and supplied, and that victory wasn't all that surprising.\n\n"In addition, when contrasted with the armed rebels, loyalist troops suffered from a massive lack of organization, cohesion, and morale.

Low, rolling hills; a broad, shallow estuary; large city nearby; and a bridge. He thought it over, reaching for an old map of Britain that he had in his bag.\n\nBeing very careful not to rip the tired old creases in the map, he unfolded it. He doubted very much that there were any plans for an excursion to the Continent, so a map of the British Isles would be just fine. The operation obviously wasn't meant to be in England, and much of Wales had more highland terrain than here, and there were no large estuaries there. His eyes moved up to Scotland.

However, per your request when you met with Defence Secretary Pym, new capital ships will also be laid down. There are two possible options, as the designs have already been available for years. As carriers have been ruled out as an option, only large, battleship-type vessels will be able to fill this role. We can either build a single, massive ship, armed with the largest guns in the world, and a length nearing a quarter of a mile; or we can build two, somewhat more modestly sized battlecruisers, comparable in size with the Kriegsmarine's old Bismarck-class ships in terms of size.\n\nWhile the larger ship would definitely provide a greater propaganda and prestige opportunity, as it would give us the single largest naval vessel in the world-- even larger than the Japanese Yamato-class-- it would probably be more practical to have the two smaller ships. They would be faster, and obviously could handle two situations simultaneously. Either way, the project will be expensive and take many months to complete."

In any case, he didn't spend too much time staring at the people, but rather the ship they were all admiring. With a carrying capacity of up to 80 aircraft, a length of more than a thousand feet, and a displacement of 95,000 tons, she was a sight to behold. The long flat runway cast an almost monolithic shadow that, with the low hanging morning sun in the distance, almost touched the shore.\n\nThere must have been a thousand people to admire the start of her first deployment. Propaganda film crews stood in the background, cameras in hand, capturing the moment for the rest of the world to see.

There had been a great deal of these talks recently, to Pym they had become more and more frustrating, even slowly becoming tiresome. Sometimes he wondered what was even the point of trying to sway Thatcher.\n\nThis particular meeting was to be about the appointment of an ambassador to the Reich. He had already hand picked an able candidate, Roger Jackling, the two men shared similar opinions on how England should handle the German behemoth. Jackling's abilities had already been proven within the Foreign office.\n\nExcept this meant little to Thatcher. She wasted no time in telling Pym who he was to send to Germania, her nomination was Frank Roberts, an outspoken believer in what he called German 'containment'. The fact that Pym had already chosen an ambassador did not appear to have even crossed her mind.\n\nAll this greatly upset Pym. The more he tried to negotiate with the Prime Minister the more she ignored him. It was enough to make him consider neglecting Thatcher's order."

However, the interests of the foreign secretary were not the same as her own.\n\nThe problem Pym had was that he had already decided upon David Ornsby to be the US ambassador.

Now is the time to reclaim that which rightfully is English."\n\nIt's all well and good making bold declarations, she thinks, but there's an ocean of difference between words and actions. There's two paths to walk in this situation, and they're sitting either side of her desk at Number 10, looking expectantly at her. The Foreign Secretary and his posse whitter on at her, saying that she should open diplomatic channels with Germany to negotiate a peaceful transfer of the Garrison. After all, they say, Germany has never been weaker, and never more likely to accept a deal.\n\nOn the other side of her sits the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Defence Secretary. They're adamant that a strong show of force while England is at its zenith and Germany is at its nadir will get the Germans to fold, return Cornwall to English hands, and reestablish England as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nShe needs to decide now; will she use a silk glove, or iron fist?"

The assorted diplomats and ambassadors gathered behind him begin chattering excitedly, so much so that she can barely hear herself think. When they calm, they look at her in anticipation, waiting for the signal to burst into action.\n\n"Excellent choice, Ma'am," the Secretary purrs, "We'll begin preparing at once.

No time to take or give an apology when there's work to be done.\n\nTheir counterparts in the Reichstag are surprisingly helpful - perhaps it's out of surprise at the frenzied tone in their voices, or perhaps they too had been looking to open lines of communication between the nations. Either way, Thatcher is quickly presented with a bakelite telephone, sitting innocuously at her desk, to the Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nHer office is empty, but she knows that there's a hundred people listening in on her end and a hundred people listening in on the other when she picks up the handset."

Rhetoric on how the English deserved their homeland united, bringing up the Versailles treaty and how wrong it had been to break Germany apart, what trauma it caused the nation.

Not exactly, he was a diplomat after all, but it was in the barely-veiled subtext. Well, she thinks, if Germany is going to throw their weight around, she'll respond in kind. She demands that the Defence staff come to the office. When they do, she's seething, and orders massive military exercises conducted on the border with the Garrison.

The joke dies down, not as funny anymore. Then they receive even more. In a week they're receiving detailed descriptions of massive military training exercises - exercises conducted in reconstructions of Truro, Plymouth, and Bodmin Moor. No one's joking now.\n\nThe Reichsminister feels like a fool looking at the phone on his desk. A short time ago he'd enjoyed mocking (subtly, he thought) the woman at the other end, and now here he was, hand hanging over the phone, reluctant to pick up the handset.

When the conversation reaches a point where they've discussed the value of Cornwall enough, Thatcher drops her demands in like a tonne of bricks.\n\n"We expect the full return of Cornwall to England - annexation in full. In return, we will allow all German soldiers on English soil free passage to their homeland, and the return of all German military equipment in Cornwall." The line goes silent for a moment.

Some argue that the return of Wehrmacht soldiers from British soil is, in fact, a win for the overextended and tired military, where others argue that withdrawal compromises German diplomatic authority in Europe.

Margaret Thatcher sits in her office and lets herself feel some pride.\n\nOf course, while a win for the English, the Plymouth Proposal did not come without its own drawbacks. The port, of course, remains in German hands. There's some anger at this, but the sentiment is - for now - drowned out by the relief and celebration. Cornwall, as a whole, has returned to England."

The English military, as of right now, can only sufficiently support an invasion of Cornwall for thirty days. After that, they expect massive supply issues and logistical collapse. In short, if they're going to invade Cornwall, they have a month.\n\nThatcher has no idea if it'll work. She doesn't know how fortified the Garrison's positions are, how well equipped and trained they are, how deeply embedded with the local populace they are.

ENG_thatcher.1000.t:0 "The Greengrocer's Daughter"
ENG_thatcher.1000.desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher always fondly remembered her time as a simple shop assistant. Not for the job in itself, but her purpose and feeling of advancement. She built herself while she helped to build her parent's business, and was compensated for her efforts appropriately. Ownership, destiny, self-worth- these were not handed to her, but earned by her steadfast determination and ability.\n\nEvery day, she would think about what she could do to better her situation. This mindset, she would frequently remind MPs and common folk alike, is sorely missing from today's England. Hard times are no excuse for laziness or envy. One must work one's way up rather than pulling others down. The groceries she sold were not forced upon the customer, but delivered freely and for mutual benefit. It was not the cruel hand of the market that determined her fate, but her own willingness to study and work hard in the cause that meant she would succeed – and others would not.\n\nThis mindset had served her well into adulthood, and her stern visage and harsh attitude may alienate some or drive potential allies away. But surely, this small sacrifice was more than made up for by the grit and bulldog's tenacity that meant that she would get what she wanted, come hell or high water. Politics is the art of the possible, and so the pragmatic and self-sufficient greengrocer's daughter had come up into a world that she would control utterly through skill, maneuvering, and sheer groundwork."

Half of our wealth has been spent on thoroughly destroying the other half. We must – and I repeat, we must – begin our recovery with serious economic reform that will refit and refuel private enterprise to take our country to its former economic standing.\n\nThis will involve many changes to monetary and fiscal policy, which shall no doubt illicit catcalls and cacophony from the cronies who have established themselves like weevils in the government's purse. However, I am reassured daily by the irritation of the English people with such socialist policy, and their desire to see their own enterprise justly rewarded.\n\nWe must utilize all of England's resources- her people, her factories, her wealth, and her ingenuity, to rebuild a better economic system that works for all people, not merely those who seek the middling status quo. I have seen what the status quo has brought to our country, and I will not have it. I suggest to all members of Parliament fed up with the way things have been done for all these years- come and join us! There's enough for everyone.\n\nAnd so, I challenge the English people to stand up for what is theirs and take responsibility for their own future.

"It's no failure of democracy to say that the average voter has a limited appetite for it," The Prime Minister elaborated in a press conference on Friday afternoon. "Participation on all levels except federal are tragically low, with a handful of corrupt elites often swaying the election in their favor, and to the detriment of the majority. The best solution is to limit the powers of these fraudulent administrative bodies, thus preventing the local tyranny of a non-representative organization."\nThe statement, though persuasive to many, didn't do much to silence critics who felt that the act was merely an attempt to centralise even more power into the hands of her party.\n\nEditors note: Cut the last sentence or the censors will do it for us."

A hiring spree has begun by the government, ironically mostly recruiting the now unemployed local administrators they had previously denounced as corrupt.\n\nWith this unprecedented legislative success handing the keys to power to the Royal Party, it's fair to say that the Royal party has centralized too.

These very same oafs who earned their place through nepotism alone and felt they had the right to bribe their way through our political system. Well, I think England has had quite enough of it, haven't we?

Company profits have increased by nearly seventy percent from the days prior to the civil war, and records have shown a rate of return for investors that has been hitherto unknown in Europe since before the Second World War.\nOn a per capita basis, England is rapidly on its way to catching up to the great economies of the world, and the overall competitiveness of it's manufacturing sector might well surpass them in the near future. Of special interest to investors is the unique role the nation plays as an economic gateway that passes through the protectionist barrier between Europe and the Americas. With this advantageous position, the English shipping industry is already booming, and investors who act quickly are likely to receive huge returns on investment in that industry.\nSo long as London remains open to both Washington and Germania, and stays with the pro-business policies of Margaret Thatcher, they can expect near unparalleled trade opportunities.

Today, our warehouses are filled to the brim with goods from around the world, our workers kept busy in well paid industrial and shipping jobs, and our investors can scarcely breathe under the mountains of profit!

ENG_mac.1000.desc:0 ""There'll always be an England..." slurred Macmillan, after his, um, how many rounds of brandy?\n\n"AND ENGLAND SHALL BE FREE!" shouted Maudling, stumbling over the table and nearly knocking the whole thing over.\n\nThey didn't quite have the courage to finish the rest of the lyrics, but they had got the important parts. For, after all, their party, United England, had emerged victorious over the dirty fascists in the RP. An enormous burden was lifted from Macmillan's chest. He felt that he could breathe again, and see again. Everything was clear to him, in that hazy smoking room, as clear as the Courvoisier in his glass. Now he had the power to reshape England however he liked. And by Jove, he would do it.\n\nMacmillan watched Maudling slump into a leather chair and cozy up. The old boy was English at heart and English in nature, nobody could ever doubt that. But did he really have the stomach for what was going to come next? What Macmillan would have to do to prevent fascism from ever rising again wasn't going to be pleasant for everyone. He continued to stare at his erstwhile ally and took a brief sip."

ENG_mac.1001.t:0 "Meet the Chairman – Harold Macmillan"
ENG_mac.1001.desc:0 "Harold Macmillan was never one for rash action, but neither was he won for backing down in a crisis. When his country called in the Great War, he went. He was wounded in that war three times serving in the Grenadier Guards, and was lucky not to be killed in it. While he was too old to fight in the Second World War, he fought from the bench, railing against appeasement and avoidance of the onflict that had to come eventually.\n\nWhen that conflict did come, Britain lost. After the invasion and the fall of London, Macmillan realized that the situation was impossible. And, patient as ever, he knew the time had come to cut England's losses and move forward. This meant untold humiliation for a nation not used to it, but that was better than what he had experienced in the Great War. One can live with humiliation. One cannot live whilst being bombed and shelled and shot and mined.\n\nSo he organized the surrender, with Monty and Mountbatten and the rest. This allowed him a strong position in the RP, being an official collaborator. He never liked that label, and came rather close to defecting entirely during the English Civil War. Yet again, the time was not right – or was it? This most careful of decisions turned into one of his greatest personal failings, as the horrors of the German Civil War stretched on without end. This was, indeed, the golden window for England to assert her independence once more.\n\nBut this is no time to cry over spilled milk. The party – nay, the country – needs a leader. Someone who will ensure that fascism is squashed from our new England and that England shall be free. But what price in freedom will the country have to pay to secure its future under "Supermac"?"

Though officially affiliated with the Royal Party since the breakup, no one could really say that his allegiance was with the government rather than his friend Macmillan. And so, due to Macmillan's power, no one was willing to get rid of him.\n\nInstead, the dreamer stuck around, obsessed with his ridiculous dream of restoring something that had already been lost. Or had it?\n\nFor when the English Civil War came, and the German Civil War along with it, there was a brief window for England to break away entirely, and become truly free again. And while Maudling sided with Macmillan again and stayed with the government, he still sees this window as wide open.\n\nNow, his task is to ensure that a free England, one with true democracy and rights for the people, is fully restored. While he is willing to pay any price for it, including another war with any German interventionists, he is not willing to compromise on that essential freedom for England. The only question is, can he convince the Chairman? For Macmillan has plans of his own, and they look very different from Maudling's fever dream."

I am sure he will agree with me that this opening is a momentous event, and one that is cause for joy and celebration. I am sure that he is as confident as I am that English democracy, an institution of hundreds of years, will soon be fully restored.\n\n"And I am also sure that, in the coming days, both parties can cooperate on many issues, like foreign policy and trade, as well as restoring our country economically through ambitious domestic programs. We can surely make England into what it once was – a respected power in the world, and a prosperous nation at home.\"\n\nMaudling went on for some time. Macmillan merely waited and smiled.

I cannot always say that it has been a joyful task. One feels many hardships when one's country is under great strain. While I have had many doubts about my own feelings in this position over many years, I have never lost faith in the English people.

What is needed now is a voice for strange and unknown times, a heart without fear and doubts. I believe that my successor can provide this, and he has my full loyalty and support.\n\n"And so, we shall all have a new King.

Over 60 at the time of his unexpected coronation, he now has to deal with a changing nation and a changing political situation.\n\nNevertheless, his crowning was subject to the usual celebration and fanfare.

The exact cause is unknown, but unscrupulous papers and the even less scrupulous public are ablaze with talk of yet another king in so short a period of time.\n\nIs a regency required? Is he being held hostage? Was Henry leading a monarchist coup to restore England and invade Wales, only to be stopped by the military, who have now put him up against a wall and shot him, only to be stopped by the PM, who is also incapacitated, but who has escaped and will cause a second civil war?\n\nOf course, the truth is well known to those close to Henry. It is unlikely the new King will last much longer, ending any speculation about his health. Leaving aside the grabbing headlines, most people are simply devastated to have the threat of a chaotic change foisted upon them, especially since Henry seemed to be a more stable King than the last, and was much more popular."

If he could just get rid of these loonies, what he might be able to do with a truly united Parliament...\n\nFor all the benefits of democracy, people like the Honourable Gentleman from Beaconsfield was one of many costs.

Montgomery gently prompted.\n\n"Yes, the food is... is..." said Macmillan, began after lazily snapping to attention and then trailed off with his disinterest at the topic. "Marshal, you have a reputation for planning. Overplanning some would say. What guides your plans since the rebels surrendered?"\n\nSo then, it seemed Bernard's dinner companion had largely called him here for consultation.

No reporter has found even a hint of what went on, but things were very different between the pair when they emerged several hours later, with the Prime Minister looking pleased with himself, and Maudling looking utterly defeated.\n\nBy days end, Maudling was seen reluctantly whipping up support for a new bill that would, reportedly, grant a greater degree of executive power to the Prime Minister's office.\n\nSome speculation has surfaced that supposes Macmillan might have intimidated his former protege outright, though most observers suspect that threats would only have needed to be implied, considering Macmillan's methods of dealing with political rivals thus far.\n\nWhatever the case, this upcoming bill is likely to be passed, and should be announced to the public in the coming weeks."

ENG_mac.1025.desc:0 "Reginald Maudling sat before Chairman Macmillan's desk, a restless leg tapping the floor time and time again.\n\nHow had it gone this way? Almost four years of democratic backsliding. The opposition - purged under accusations of corruption, the British left - killed in a bloody civil war, the far right - denounced and arrested as terrorists. It was an exclusive minority of opinions that Chairman Macmillan allowed to participate in politics, opinions that largely fell within the United England party.\n\nWorse, Macmillan, that power-mad lunatic had essentially turned parliament into the spectating seats of governance!\n\nCould English Democracy even survive this debacle? Was it already dead?\n\n\"Reggie?\" asked the Prime Minister, sliding a glass of whiskey across the desk and taking a seat across from Maudling. \"You seem completely lost, Reggie. I'll repeat myself. I said: I'm proud of how well we did in a single term. The great evils of our nation, the fascist National Front, the blundering Royal Party? Defeated. Utterly.\"\n\nReginald felt his eyes bulge in incredulity, the veins in his neck pop out in furious rage. How could he be so proud of himself? So nonchalant about what he and his cronies had done? He who had eroded the republic? He wanted to shout, wanted to scream against the darkness.\n\nBut instead, he said nothing."

He knows full well that such language is well out of parliamentary rules."\n\nThe offending MP rose to his feet. "I will not rescind my comment, and I will still refer to him as a lying bastard, who seeks to destroy our Parliam-"\n\nThe chorus of yells, shouts, and even screams was absurd, and utterly drowned out the Speaker's order for the Honourable Gentleman to vacate the House immediately.\n\nMacmillan sat near his podium. They would whine and yell and scream about overriding democracy. But they would pass it. He would see to it.

Our biggest foe has been the incessant and unfounded worry that we aim to set up a permanent dictatorship, so doing a few benevolent acts should hopefully assuage that fear.\n\nTruthfully, reforming the school system, while a nice idea, was hardly on our agenda until now.

Those who have been most vocal in protesting this change are already facing a rude awakening that the police are ready and willing to imprison them en-masse.\n\nThe declaration could likely spell the end for the National Front, who have always bordered on being more or less explicit in their fascism.\n\nEven so, Chesterton and his to advisors are reconsidering their rhetoric, hoping they might hide their views behind a layer of deniability, yet still ultimately reach the ears of the now closeted fascists, who will understand the true meaning of what's being said."

And he knew the defining feature of that England was a democracy, where every man had the right to vote for whoever they wanted. Right now, he could provide England with economic and military security, sure. And he could stay in to keep it that way for quite a while. But it would be through the system the Germans set up, and England would never really be the country he once knew.\n\nNo, democracy was coming back, he decided. A democracy like the one before the war. One where people could debate how the country was doing. To finally free England from the shackles of occupation. To destroy the vestiges of life under the Nazi jackboot. It would be hard, and it might destroy his career if he succeeded. But he would rather be known as the PM who brought back democracy and lost than the PM who ruled for years through his cabal in the Royal Party.\n\nSome would say that England was not ready for democracy. That the lower classes would install some radical leftist in the parliament and ruin everything. But they would want a voice in parliament eventually, no matter what they did.

Yes, answered nearly everyone. But what they didn't know is that the same democracy's foundations lived on.\n\nEngland had strong democratic traditions, going back to the Magna Carta of 1215. It had a parliament, elections, and all the other hallmarks of a representative government. Even the Germans could not strip all those rights away if they wished to make an England that could be considered legitimate. Thus, England was left with a parliament, an election system, and a party to run things. It was handicapped in many ways, but it was still there as a sad shell of its former self.\n\nFrom that shell, England would be rebuilt. Public debate would be authorized. Parliament would become more transparent. News would be made fair, free, and unrestricted. And every English citizen would be returned their sacred right to vote.

Nations with low regard for the rights of their own citizens, or for the rule of law.\n\nMy greatest fear is that these nations will take advantage of our proceedings to take control over a small group of disloyal party members and exert outsized influence upon our government. Perhaps even so much as to take control of the Royal Party and take a number of anti-democratic actions against the opposition. In another way, they could easily foment mistrust among the people of England, and attempt to foment a revolution through that manner.\n\nAnd so, we must turn ourselves to reform the systems that may give safe harbor to insidious foreign aggressors. To make our government more transparent, more accessible. And to remove the barriers that have discouraged our population from participating in domestic affairs. To prevent the abuses of the few, Britain must have the support and the alertness of the many.\""

The more influence he had, the more he could press for reforms. And the more Macmillian was likely to get what he wanted passed.\n\nGetting Liberalism to be more popular was another thing that could help democratization. The more people got behind the reforms, the easier things would be. Yet, it came at a cost. While Maudling would have more to work with, Macmillan's own base would be hurt.

Decrees drawn up in secret, and announced with little to no reasoning. Citizens may find themselves afoul of new and draconian regulations overnight. More alarming is the possibility these decrees could never be overruled by the parliament, effectively granting power entirely in the hands of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe solution to this is to apply a proper legal framework to prevent emergency rule. Any decree made by a prime minister must have proper legal basis and reasoning to take effect. Emergency periods shall have a strict time limit, and must be reapproved by parliament after the time period has passed. And emergency decrees can be overturned at any time by an act of parliament.

For the first time in quite a long while, an ordinary person can pose a question to people in power, and they will have to answer them. Even more amazingly, the panel on the program may disagree, and oftentimes debates one another live on the radio! A new panel is rotated in every week, and a new location for the event is chosen as well, giving the listeners a variety of perspectives and topics.\n\nThe fifty minute show is an amazing hit. People tune in to hear the discussions and debates, unheard of for so long. Crowds are eager to attend the program and ask what they want.

This new secondary school had been built in Newham, in Eastern London. The state of education in the country was very poor, he had to admit. And the civil war hadn't helped things along.

Today, Macmillan was talking about the dangers of authoritarianism again, arguing that outside forces still seeked to turn things against the country. The government was not doing enough to change things, even with the progress that had been made.\n\nBut then, he laid out his policy proposal on the matter, and it was a huge shock. That every Englishman and Englishwoman be given the right to vote for parliament. No more would the House of Commons be a playground for the rich and well connected. The average person would have their say. This would, he claimed, make England safer by ensuring that PMs were answerable not to tiny cabals, but to every person in their district.\n\nReaction was swift. Liberals cheered the move, as how could a supposedly republican system exist without the participation of everyone in it? Others were not so keen on this. The old guard and the elite were angry that the influence of the upper classes were being taken away. Their base was the rich, for God's sakes!

Instead it represents only a few well off, reactionary individuals.\n\nWhen parliament was only representative of the elite, England was a minor European power.

The Royal Navy is, of course, the main object of most government meetings. All members agree that funds must be drastically increased to the main instrument with which England rose to empire; how to use such funds is another matter entirely. The umpteenth meeting on the matter is to be held in the restored House of the Admiralty. The building shines just like the old days, and it would be so easy to forget that everything must be rebuilt from scratch...\n\nDespite the participation of the Prime Minister himself, the meeting soon degenerates into a battle between two sides. On one side are the younger officers, mostly returned exiles from Canada who have studied with the Americans: they strongly advocate for a "modern" fleet, based on carriers rather than battleships. While a sound proposal, this would mean abandoning the image of the Royal Navy as it has been for centuries, and some would see it as a sign of subservience to the Americans.\n\nThe other faction, counting among them several old admirals who have just been reinstated, proposes a completely different doctrine. The Royal Navy - they say - is more than just a fleet: it is the symbol of British greatness, one that is far from past, and that must return! Also, they claim that the people will surely appreciate a show of strength...\n\nThe meeting is dismissed without any serious progress being made, but Jellicoe knows there is no more time to be lost. The Royal Navy will return to the forefront, one way or the other, and the responsibility for its form rests on his shoulders: who better than an admiral's son for rebuilding the navy?"

In order to move forward, the Lord of the Admiralty is planning to hold a joint meeting with the Americans to discuss further cooperation. Our allies are happy to help, and have asked what we should focus on.\n\nOn one hand, the would be happy to provide us with the latest designs of their submarines, greatly speeding up the process of updating our underwater fleet.

In the weeks immediately following the final victory, the fear of German retaliation was enough to justify the extension of the emergency measure, but now that the situation is stabilizing more and more voices are calling for its repeal.\n\nWhen the question was finally raised about the conscription, Prime Minister Jellicoe knew he couldn't postpone the matter any longer. After a brief consultation with Minister Powell, he took to the small podium and started talking.\n\n"I thank the Honourable Lady for her question. The government has examined the matter of the extensive draft with the utmost attention, carefully balancing advantages and disadvantages of our decision."\n\n"It goes without saying that the first implementation of the measure was required by the exceptional circumstances we found ourselves in: the men and women who have given their lives for the liberation of England will forever be remembered!"

The fox desperately tried to lose its pursuers, but the dogs pressed and pressed, until it simply fell to the ground, exhausted. The younger of the two men took out his hunting rifle, aimed, and shot the defeated beast.\n\n"Excellent aim as usual, George," said the older hunter. The two dismounted to assess their prey, the dogs barking to get their reward for the good hunt.\n\n"Thanks, Claude. Suffolk never disappoints." Jellicoe replied.\n\n"You didn't invite me just for a hunt, did you, Claude?" Jellicoe asked his mentor and friend.\n\n"No, George. I didn't. I wanted to talk to you about a very important matter." answered Claude.\n\nThe two men sat under a large oak, then the old general spoke. "I know you are going to rebuild the Royal Army, and I wanted to give you my advice. I have fought for years against the Germans, and have spent many more reflecting upon the causes for our debacle."\n\nThe Prime Minister nodded, then let his friend continue: "We were unprepared. We relied too much on the Royal Navy to keep them on the other side of the Channel, and when they came, we could do nothing but retreat. We retreated North because we had no prepared line.

After a silent nod from Jellicoe, he went on.\n\n"Some of my peers believe that our defeat was due to not having enough men. These peers are morons. We lost because we had so many soldiers we didn't know where they were and how to direct them. What I propose is a radical reform, one that will make the Royal Army a professional fighting force!"\n\n"You do realize that waving radical reforms in front of the General staff is the same as waving a red drape in front of a bull, don't you?" the Prime Minister added, with a worried grin.\n\n"I won't deny the obvious, but I need to state something even more obvious: if we rebuild our army as it was before, it will be just as effective as it was before. We will meet the same end as we did before. What we need is a smaller force, unhindered by logistics, and armed and trained in such a way that they can overcome any resistance at a point we choose."\n\nThe officer went on to explain his proposal, pointing out the necessary changes and the focal points of the new doctrine.

#### Cornwall Crisis Events

ENG_Corn_crisis.1.t:0 "The Pistol Held to England's Head"
ENG_Corn_crisis.1.desc:0 "A few miles from Bristol lies a fence of barbed wire. Beyond that is the greatest threat to England's independence and prosperity. An area that guarantees that we are no safer than we were in the first few days of Sea Lion. A land that by all rights, political, cultural, and geographic, should belong to England, but does not. This is Cornwall.\n\nCornwall itself isn't a threat. It only has a few divisions of German troops, most of whom are well trained, but small in number. In a wider context, it is terrifying. In an emergency, the Germans could move a large number of troops into Plymouth, and we would be dealing with an army group on English soil when the war begins. If we are to keep our country safe, we must eliminate Cornwall's garrison. If we are to exercise control over the whole of England, we must eliminate Cornwall.\n\nBut it would be unwise to strike first without considering how Germany would respond. Germany might very well send troops to back up Cornwall and start a war with us. Or they may be more open to a negotiated withdrawal in exchange for certain concessions. Whatever the case, we're going to be rid of the Cornwall garrison, and finally be free once and for all."

But he doesn't seem too interested in doing much beyond that. Who controls the Reich is a better question, although there isn't as straightforward an answer.\n\nAs may be obvious, Germany isn't in a good state of affairs at the moment. Hitler died, and numerous contenders are still fighting over the estate. Every one of them has a claim to the entire Nazi empire, but none of them have the ability to enforce this claim. And the factions are unable to send a large amount of forces across the channel to help a client state of theirs. Just look at their Reichskommisariats, they are all falling apart with not a single German to come to their aid!\n\nThis is obviously a terrible state of affairs for the civilians of Germany, and they have our deepest sympathies. However, while the Übermensch of the Reich are all busy killing each other, we can take Cornwall in a quick action without fear of retaliation. None of these prospective Führers will be able to do more than protest. They might not notice at all if we do it quick enough."

He has drawn up several plans to deal with the garrison there, and is interested in presenting one of them to the cabinet. Templer's plan promises a high degree of surprise and minimal casualties. He has been in contact with the Minister of Defense, and the minister believes the plan has merit.\n\nI know that every plan has a degree of risk to it, but Marshal Templer has thought this plan through. He is one of our most well regarded generals, and it would be wise to hear him out. And any plan he comes up with would have support from the rest of the army.\n\nIf we want to discuss the operation with him, I could set up a cabinet meeting for tomorrow morning. He can make it, and so can the rest of the relevant ministers. We'll have to move the meeting with the Peruvian ambassador to later in the afternoon, but this is far more important.\""

They performed their job well enough in the English Civil War, but they are not nearly as motivated as they were then. HMMLR wanted to kill them all, so it was a bit of sink-or-swim for them.They are still small in number, and they are not a match for British troops if we catch them by surprise. Most are stuck on policing duty around the area anyway.\n\nThe only danger is in a protracted war that lasts long enough for them to get aid and support from Europe. This will be a strong possibility if we go through the land border region. While simple to pull off, this has been where they expected our forces to come through for quite a while. They will certainly have defenses in place, quite possibly enough to slow us down until Germany can intervene.\n\nOur strategy, then, is not to fight them head to head, but to pull off a flanking maneuver from the sea. There is plenty of coastline where an amphibious detachment could come in and cut the garrison off from reinforcements and resupply. The nearness of England allows for a great deal of surprise as well. This will make any frontward advance easy and quick.\n\nWith your permission, I will contact the RAF and the Royal Navy, and commence with the plans to eliminate Cornwall. We can get a troop estimate drawn up, and an order of battle for you soon. I'll concentrate on moving the army into the proper position so we can pull this operation off.\""

All concerns and situations were taken into account, and we worked together to make sure all sections of His Majesty's Armed Forces were prepared for the operation.\n\nThe RAF has moved its forces close to the Cornwall area and has set up in local air bases. They have begun running reconnaissance flights near Cornwall, and anti-shipping operations in the Bristol and English Channels. Close Air Support will be available for our forces on the ground, as well as fighter cover, if the weather provides. Our anti-shiping activities will also delay the enemy from landing troops, and help cover our own forces from surface and U-boat attacks.\n\nThe Royal Navy is likewise ready. They have moved ships to block the channel, and patrol the areas around Cornwall. Ships are available to provide fire support to our forces as they move inland. And we have escorts for any invasions that may be planned. If the enemy attempts to reinforce, we will give them heavy punishment.\n\nUpon the assurances of the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Air Staff, the Chiefs of Staff Committee have recommended "GO" for this operation and that it should commence as soon as possible.

ENG_Corn_crisis.6.desc:0 "Operation Seal began with the sounds of wire cutters at 3 in the morning. The fence set up to prevent outside incursion into Cornwall was taken down by Royal Engineers who cleared areas for troops to move in. Scouting units poured through, followed by waves of tanks and infantry. What guards there were on the border were quickly overwhelmed, unable to resist.\n\nOn the beaches of Cornwall, Royal Marines made their landings silently. Cornwall had few positions to defend themselves from an amphibious attack. There was concern amongst the Royal Navy about the possibility of hitting civilian targets, so pre-invasion fire was held back. Once the troops landed, they scarcely encountered resistance except for a few isolated police patrols who were quickly fought off.\n\nBy midday, London was pleased with the progress the units were making. Casualties were light, and massive gains had been made. German resistance was weak and unorganized, and they had been caught by surprise. Intelligence reported that the Reich was stunned by this turn of events, and it seemed the Kriegsmarine wasn't able to do anything about it at the moment.\n\nBy the end of the day, it was clear on the ground that Germany had not failed to put up an effective defense, it was that the troops there simply lacked the will to. Massive numbers of Germans gave up without a fight, or merely offered token resistance. There were only a few cases where the English had to blast out the die-hards. The garrison was shocked, demoralized, and homesick. And they had collectively given up.\n\nEngland pushed deeper and deeper into Cornwall as the night went on."

There were plenty of suicides in this operation, most of whom were German garrison leaders. This was a notable example.\n\nMany of the other garrison officers, however, had decided to take their chances with the English. This was not an uncommon feeling, given the number captured as England had pushed into the territory. In fact, Portsmouth had been taken without much resistance at all. The lynchpin of the German plan against England was taken, and now there was no hope of German victory.\n\nThe prisoners gave many reasons for the lack of resolve. The political situation had sapped many of the will they needed to fight on. What Reich do you die for if there's several of them? And the lack of support from Germany made the garrison hopeless. They could not hope to win without the might of the Wehrmacht, and the English knew that just as well as the garrison soldier understood.\n\nThe threat that haunted England had dematerialized. The elite soldiers of Germany had given up without a fight. The beachhead of Sea Lion had been crushed.

The English flag was waved everywhere, and people cheered at the statement. They were joined in this sentiment by people all across the Kingdom.\n\n\"For too long, Cornwall has been occupied, humiliated, and shamed by the occupying forces. With the garrison on our shores, we could not make decisions for ourselves. We could not make the necessary moves to make England strong again. We could not make any move to restore our place in the world.\n\nWith the garrison gone, England can finally put the legacy of 1943 behind her. This great nation can now make its own decisions, and do whatever it wants without the fear of foreign influences and threats. We now stand on our own two feet, ready to face the entire world without fear.\"\n\nScarcely anybody in England disagreed with this sentiment. Many believed Germany was too limiting, and always a threat. Cornwall kept England a step away from becoming a Reichskommissariat. Now, the threat was gone, the garrison vanquished.

The German army now circles over England waiting for its chance to dive down and clutch its prey.

The request was, however, clear, and it was a request which was readily accepted by Montgomery.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, Montgomery was expected to be the one who would draw up plans for an invasion of the Cornwall Garrison. The operation would have to be swift, calculated and without even the slightest risk of failure. If these points were neglected, the repercussions on the english government and its people would be immense. Germany would show even less restraint than it did before, England would be left as nothing more than a husk of its already hollowed self.\n\nYet despite being fully aware of this, Montgomery's reply to the Prime Minister was calm and brief."

Next, the military will need to strike quickly, limiting casualties will not be an available option. Speed and overwhelming power being all the advantages the english army has over the garrison. Finally, Montgomery concluded that the assault concluded that the assault should begin at the soonest possible convenience, lest the enemy were somehow to uncover the plan.\n\nHis methods may not have been entirely what [ENG.GetLeader] was hoping for, but they understood there was no other choice.

The Prime Minister tried their best to remain above it all, but at times it was almost impossible. Much to everyone's dismay, the drafting drifted later and later into the day.\n\nAfter yet more arguing, the correct phrasing was found and the request was immediately sent off to Washington.

Opinions on what direction to take has split the NDL down factional lines\n\nSurprisingly, both Minister Williams and MP Powell both agree on prioritizing domestic job growth, and their respective factions are likely to follow along with them. Both acknowledge that the effects of this would not be seen for some time. However, both argue this would ensure England's economic independence and strengthen her in the long run.\n\nForiegn Minister Stevas argues that the short term growth found by bringing in foriegn jobs is essential to England's economic recovery, even if much of that growth will be tied to foreign interests. Although both left and right factions accuse Stevas of selling out to the OFN, and have rallied together to oppose this notion, they only have enough combined votes to stall a vote.\n\nDeputy Minister Eccles and his small, pro status quo faction are currently undecided, and could be the deciding vote.\n\nAs usual, it falls to you, Earl, to unite the party.

Instead, he ran into a crumbling storefront, a faded sign hanging slanted on the dirty glass. The whole street was in a sorry state. For every open business, there were two more closed or on their way out. The homeless dotted the street, surrounded by empty houses. Suddenly, a single gunshot loudly broke Jellicoe's focus on the street. As his security detail dragged him away, a woman shrieked as she entered her husband's room, finding him with a smoking pistol in one hand, and a brown envelope in the other. The Prime Minister returned to Downing Street, shaken, but filled with new resolve.\n\nAs Jellicoe sat down, Eccles and several other officials presented him with a report on the state of the economy. The numbers were, as expected, not looking great. He paid them little attention. It wasn't anything he hadn't already seen. The Prime Minister picked up the phone."

Projections showed that the perilous freefall they had been in has, at least for now, stabilized. He saluted the guard as he drove away.\n\nJellicoe drove down a street, and smelled in the calm evening air the smell of freshly baked bread. He saw a happy family moving boxes from a car. Although there was still much to do for the economy, Jellicoe couldn't help but feel some satisfaction.\n\nBut the job wasn't done, far from it. Stevas had riled up the liberal wing to shift the country's focus to social reforms, notably decriminalizing homosexuality. Already, the Patriots have come out strongly in opposition, although Powell seems reluctant to follow along with the more hateful rhetoric coming from his faction. However, if his party didn't act decisively, the socialists would definitely use this to gain more support.\n\nYes, the next weeks and months of Jellicoe's prime ministership would be spent trying to wrangle his party to act, one way or another, to address the social issues of England.

Their methods may be without precedent but they are not entirely unfounded. The program they have come up with aims to achieve the goals set out in the Beveridge Report which was published over twenty years ago.\n\nThe report itself came out a year before the war's end, yet it outlined how Britain's economy could be remodeled if it were to emerge victorious, a situation it naively believed could be achieved. Its focus was on the need to eradicate poverty from the country, for this to be done the five 'giants' of: Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness must be defeated.\n\nBeveridge had requested Wilson to research much of the report, and although the prime minister's old mentor may no longer be around to see his work put into reality, he hopes that their work will not be in vain.

Two methods have been proposed, both rely on the opening of England's markets to bring foreign money increasing the volume of the country's exports.\nThe first harkens back to the days of the industrialised England of the nineteenth century, of course the same exploitative practices of unchecked capitalism will be avoided. Instead the government will help build factories and protect the workers, thus taking many workers out of employment. The profits will be reinvested by the government on behalf of the workers, ensuring a fair exchange for their labor.\nThe second involves the exploitation of England's natural resources, from coal to steel. Both these industries will be nationalised and maintained by the government to ensure maximum efficiency and rights of the miners and workers.\nEither way, England's economy will become more reliant on foreign consumers from the Organization of Free Nations, but the people would rather we were dependent on them than the Germans."

All that stand in the way of the road to reconstruction are the Five Giants that we must overcome.\n\nWant has become one of the more pressing issues of the nation. The people have been left impoverished by the fascists and the civil war we had to fight to overthrow them, yet we have already made great strides toward getting more of them off the streets and into work. However those who remain jobless will also be in need of our protection and the government has already come up with a plan to defeat each giant:\n\nDisease has always been a financial burden for the poorest in society, as a result many can not afford proper treatment and their ailments often deteriorate. This has for some time been an area in which capitalism has failed society. A robust national health service will replace the old model and ensure equal care for all.\n\nIgnorance is the most important giant to defeat for the future prosperity of England. As the next generation will need to be properly taught in order for them to continue improving society in the future. New schools will have to be built, with a new curriculum to match.\n\nSqualor has unfortunately built up within England's inner cities, slums have appeared as the people have been unable to afford their homes. These will have to be cleared to make way for the new program of council houses that will soon be introduced.\n\nIdleness will have to be struck down swiftly, the effects of unemployment on the people have been disastrous and many just want to get back into work. More key industries are to be nationalized by the SLP and a comfortable wage will be offered to those the government employs.\n\nThe time to begin the fight against poverty is upon the government, and they will likely not stop their efforts until every one of their aims are achieved and the lives of the people are made better than they have ever been before."

And everyone not in the crowd outside was gathered around a television set for the duration of the ceremony. Everyone could see the coronation, and everyone could be a part of it.\n\nNot to say this had dampened attendance along the procession route.

Once she had seated herself on the chair of Estate, the religious paraphernalia and the coronation garments were brought in. Then came the first, necessary step. The Queen stood next to King Edward's Chair. "Sirs," said the Archbishop of Canterbury, \"I here present unto you Queen Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?"\n\n"God save Queen Elizabeth!" affirmed the crowd.

For everything that HMMLR had worked for, everything that so many men had died to do, and every sacrifice made by the people of England, it was for this.

Enoch Powell was becoming a massive problem. His statements in the press kept causing headaches in the party. The SLP had gone from mildly displeased to furious when the man spoke on immigration, for it could no longer be considered a "misstep" and was now clearly a window into a dark and hateful mind.\n\nThe NDL could simply not comment and turn away from Powell, as it had for so long. Or...it could undercut him. Sideline the Patriots. Weaken them. Help the liberals out. That had its own problems with party unity. But surely, something had to be done."

"I went to Africa, India, and England in military intelligence back in the world war, and I never saw combat. I sign up for the rebellion, take part in the Civil War, and never see combat either. And now, I hear that even if we lost, the bloody collabs wouldn't have even shot me!"\n\n"From what I hear, Wingate was awfully tempted to do just that back in India," remarked Auchinleck, prompting Stirling to snort.\n\nEverybody at the dinner party was happy.

"The government is very keen on the OFN, it's really a matter of you all being keen on us."\n\n"We'll see what Her Majesty thinks about this," chuckled the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Nothing really disastrous happened, and it was mostly a breeze.\n\nWhat's important is that Prime Minister Jellicoe is still interested in the OFN. I mean, that's no surprise. He was basically Claude Auchinleck's handpicked successor. He's got the same monarch as Canada. And he hates the Nazis just as much as the next guy. That's great news, and it's good his party is backing him up on that as well.\n\nAnyway, nothing much else happened. Mostly just talk on improving relations with the other member nations.

"We wish to seek an independent foreign policy from Germany, and that means working with other nations to counteract the influence of the Pakt."\n\nThey were talking again. Stevas tried to eat a bit to take his mind off it. Finally, the Prime Minister spoke through the translator this time. "Foreign Secretary, you do understand our hesitation to grant recognition to a nation close with the OFN?"\n\n"I do, but the relationship is more as a guarantee of safety against Nazi Germany than an act against the Sphere, Prime Minister. If you look at our geopolitical situation, you would find that the OFN is the most natural ally to balance against Nazi agression."\n\nMore talking. Stevas went back to his food. Why was Japanese food so weird? Maybe they were tired of it as well. Curry was popular here, he was told. And the Emperor ate an English breakfast every morning, didn't he? Hopefully that was a good sign.\n\nFinally, the Prime Minister said "Mister Stevas, although we cannot commit to a full diplomatic normalization at this moment, we will recognize your government as the rightful one of England.""

You stand accused of high treason against England and her people. How do you plead?\". \"Not guilty,\" his lawyer responded, unconvincingly.\n\nHome's defense team gave an uninspired, stunted speech that claimed he was \"too scared to fulfil his duty as an Englishman to resist the Germans\" and \"feared for his life\". Once they were finished, the prosecution immediately tore into Home, insulting his character, calling him a coward, and of course, a \"damned bloody traitor\". The jury took no time to deliver their deliberation.\n\nHome's first thoughts after the verdict were of rage. Those fools. Once Germany gets back on their feet, they would be back to crush England once and for all. There would be no more England after they were done. But he calmed down.

His goal had been to see a return to English democracy. However, he had decided to remain in the Royal Party during the war out of a fear the rebellion would be unsuccessful and because of a fear that the garrison at Cornwall would put an end to organized resistance along with Germany. It was only after the war had ended, with a free government restored, the garrison crushed, and Germany still in chaos did he realize the enormity of his mistake. He accepted responsibility for his actions, and apologized.\n\nThis threw the trial into a tailspin.

Many had reasons to fly to Reichskommissariat Norwegen. But some had a different purpose than any of the other passengers.\n\nA few minutes after England had disappeared behind them and the flight was over the North Sea, a woman got out of her seat at the back of the aircraft and walked to the front. When a stewardess asked if she needed some sort of assistance, the woman pulled out a pistol and put it to the stewardess's head.

And the Hudson family were worried the hijackers would crash the aircraft somewhere.\n\nFor several hours, the passengers waited in fear, unknowing of the plans the hijackers had made.

When it landed, Lufthansa 302 was directed to stop on the tarmac outside of the main terminal, where police officers were waiting for it.\n\nMany passengers worried that they would be in a lengthy hostage situation that would end with a deadly police storming. These fears were alleviated when the hijackers surrendered soon after landing, giving themselves and the daughter of the woman over to the Scottish police. Soon after, a group of police and diplomatic officials boarded the plane. They informed the passengers the hostage situation was over, and the hijackers merely intended to use the plane as a method of entry into Scotland. The plane would be allowed to continue to Bergen in a few hours. However, if any passenger wished to remain in Scotland, they were welcome to do so. The message was repeated in German and Norwegian for the other passengers.\n\nImmediately, a young Norwegen couple stood up and made clear their intention to defect. This provoked the ire of Colonel Rösch, who made a mental note to report the couple to his superiors as soon as he got off the plane. This action had a different effect on the Hudson family, who discussed in hushed whispers the benefits and disadvantages of getting off the plane. Eventually, they decided to do what they thought would be best for their children, and got off the plane as well.\n\nMany people on the flight did not jump at the opportunity, however.

The goal of this forced landing in Scotland was so they could defect, along with the woman's 11 year old daughter. This situation was not unheard of, and there were reports of these types of hijackings in the Unity Pakt with varying degrees of success.

While they attempted to process everyone and get into contact with Pakt diplomats informing them of the safety of the remaining passengers, officials went aboard and announced that anyone on the flight could seek asylum in Scotland.

ENG_flavor.6.desc:0 "The first news the Pakt received related to Lufthansa 302 since it dropped off of the Newcastle radar was a news report in Scotland. A Ju 152 had landed in Aberdeen, it said, and the hijackers had given themselves up to the Scottish authorities. Germany immediately contacted Scotland through diplomatic channels, demanding the hijackers be deported to the Pakt, and that the passengers and crew be allowed to return home as well. A few hours later, Scotland responded with a flat \"no\" to any extradition, and said the aircraft had been allowed to continue to Bergen.\n\nWhen the aircraft arrived in Bergen that night, the passengers were taken by the Gestapo and asked to relay everything they saw or heard. It wasn't much to go on. A man and a woman pulled guns out over the North Sea and demanded the aircraft turn and go to Scotland. They didn't declare any specific affiliations with any group, or make statements in support of an ideology. Regrettably, several English and Norwegen citizens had agreed to stay behind in Scotland along with them.\n\nThen came the digging through all the records. The hijackers were English citizens suspected of attempting to purchase transport through the Scottish border, and were being looked at when the hijacking occurred. Many in the Pakt, especially on the security side, weren't satisfied. There had to be a resistance component to this, they thought. They interrogated and detained close relations of the hijackers and defectors, but they were just as shocked as everyone else. The English resistance didn't seem to step up their activity after the attack, and no other copycat hijackings occurred at the same time.\n\nAs much as some didn't like it, the taking of Lufthansa 302 appeared to be the result of a desperate pair of disaffected English, and not part of a wider terrorist plot against the Reich."

ENG_flavor.8.desc:0 "Field Marshal Douglas Wimberley is a controversial figure on the British isle. Many in Scotland believe he was instrumental in keeping Scotland secure from German occupation. Others see him as a traitor and paranoid madman. This has led Wimberley himself to reappear in the public eye to release a new autobiography that he hopes will cause the \"misconceptions\" of his time as Chief of Staff of the Scottish military to be cleared up.\n\n\"Scottish Soldier,\" Wimberley's book, is the culmination of work that the Field Marshal started some time before his retirement and the reunification. It is a complete recounting of his military service, with special emphasis given to his time in the First and Second World Wars, and the formation of the Scottish Republic. Wimberly argues the republic was a necessary action to defend Scotland, and was not merely a case of opportunism. He also defends some of the more controversial actions the Scottish Armed Forces took under his tenure, declaring those actions kept Scotland free, and made the liberation of and eventual unification with England possible.\n\nDespite massive sales in the north and midlands, the book has come in for a fair share of controversy. Some unionists and leftists accused Wimberley of being a malignant spirit in Scotland, and one that potentially jeopardized both Scottish freedom and union with England. Others have claimed the book is evidence that Wimberley was merely being misunderstood this entire time, pointing to his support of HMMLR and loyal service in the war as proof. Wimberley himself has not commented on the matter. He has, however, donated a collection of personal papers to the National Records of Scotland, hoping they and the book will be of aid to future researchers of the Scottish Republic."

One which took them to another country, one that for sure wouldn't betray them to Germany. And thus they knew the worst was over when the smugglers dropped them off in Norwich.\n\nEventually the Kulesas ended up with many other Lithuanian immigrants in the neighborhood of Becktown. There, life was tough. Crime was rampant, poverty widespread, and oftentimes it felt they were not wanted by the public. Little Joakimas was harassed by his peers at school for his limited understanding of English. Edvardas had trouble finding steady work for the longest time. And the neighborhood had quite a fright when some youths painted a swastika on the side of the Kulesa's apartment building. Sometimes, they considered moving to somewhere else. Scotland, New York, or even Vancouver. But in the end, they stuck it out.\n\nNow things are looking up. Edvardas found a job as a chef for a local restaurant, cooking up cepelinai for hungry Londoners. The kids are doing well in school. And it seems like the Kulesa family has finally put the violence and starvation of their homeland behind them forever, basking in the peace and prosperity of Free England instead."

In particular, the cosmic dreaming featured on the track Space Oddity has captured the desire of millions to reclaim some part of our universe as a place of serenity, of neutrality.

In the misty, cracked roadway in the town's south, she'd enter Everett's Book Shop, the quaint building made of dark oak marked only by its bright green name painted above the entrance. Time to look for another volume to spend her nights with, once the kids were fed and tucked in.\n\nAfter the brief greeting and chatting with old Everett, Irena went over to the world literature section. She perused the shelves like a skilled detective, an eye for any title from her native Poland, knowing that anything she found would likely be at least thirty years old. As she ran her fingers through each section of the towering shelf, she fully expected to come up empty handed...until reaching a toppled over collection on the very bottom level. All in nondescript red binding, within these titles were hundreds of pages written in Polish, some so old that she could hardly comprehend half of what was being said. Tales of medieval rebels, supernatural battles, and the daily struggles of family life: all memories of a land she could hardly envision since first arriving on England's shores ten years ago. In an instant, piled up the books and pressed them up against her chest, moving carefully over to Everett, calculating in her head to see if she could even afford such a collection with her meager wages.\n\n"Find everything you need?"

That was the first man he ever killed.\n\nMuch more fighting had gone on in those twenty years for Ball. Him being cut off had a lot to do with it, and so did him eventually finding a SAS stay-behind squad. None of them were too keen on ever giving up, and Bell went along with the flow. He saw many of his friends die, seen people mauled beyond belief by explosions, and been in many situations where he believed his life was over. But he kept going.\n\nOne day, he thought, England would be free. Any trace of collaborationist oppression would be eliminated. England would be a true democracy, where everything would be decided by the will of the people. No monarch, or dictator would be doing the thinking for England anymore. And men like him would no longer be needed.\n\nBut for now, he had to keep his thoughts in the present. His squad was tasked with wiping out a collab checkpoint.

The beer dumped on the officers and the shoves they encountered trying to catch these unruly hooligans was all in good sport, but as the Premiere League finals approached, things started to get nastier.

The club (and most of the town) were known to support the government, come what may, and a thrashing might have shut the Clarets up for a good couple months. But this was not to be. A long pass down the field by Angus allowed for Walker to cross over to Harris, a Burnley favorite and winking HMMLR supporter. This last pass would forever be debated among football circles- was it offsides? What if it hadn't been Harris that scored? Were the refs secret HMMLR supporters, or paid off by resistance members?\n\nBut as Harris jumped across the field in victory after the goal, none of this mattered to the Burnley fans. And shortly after the roars died down, the chanting started. "KRAUTS, KRAUTS, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE, FUCK RIGHT OFF TO YOUR OWN COUNT-RY!" Shortly thereafter, the two sections soon crashed against each other, red against blue, in a maelstrom of disorganized violence. Fans poured out onto the field, or were thrown over the stands.

When Parliament opened again under the auspices of Her Majesty, it was widely accepted that the oath would be administered to the new parliamentarians without complaint.\n\nHowever, a few hardliners in the Socialist Labour Party objected to this. Why would they declare their loyalty to some unelected monarch when their true allegiance is to the proletariat of England who elected them and gave them their positions? This sparked a massive controversy, as many of the privileges of an MP, such as the salary, debate privileges, and the ability to actually vote on things, were dependent on the person taking the oath.\n\nImmediately, the Patriots pounced, with Powell calling for the immediate expulsion of the communists. This further enraged the hardliners, and spirited debate soon followed. However, Jellicoe did not wish to be responsible for throwing out several elected members of parliament, and Stevas also advised against it. Harold Wilson wasn't willing to give up a segment of what support he had, and even Birch could see the potential problem of a portion of his caucus being tossed.\n\nAfter much negotiation between the parties, a workaround was found. While the hardliners would be required to take the oath declaring their faithfulness, they would be allowed to omit the \"bear true allegiance\" segment, so they could affirm they would follow the Queen's laws without committing what they deemed as a betrayal of their constituents.

Thus, when the American SOSUS sonar detected a German Type 401 off the Faroe islands, the forces of the free world began their typical, yet necessary hunt.\n\nFirst, aircraft from all of the OFN immediately raced to find the intruder. Despite the large numbers searching for the submarine, it was a helicopter from England guarding a frigate that first reported they had picked something up on the sonar system. Their microphone they had suspended from a cable had heard the unmistakable sound of U-boat propellers. A few hours later, a Sonobuoy dropped from an American P-3 Orion confirmed the discovery.\n\nIf this had been an actual combat situation, the U-boat would be blown up by a torpedo as soon as the helicopter had contact. But this was not, and the OFN had a better idea for what to do with the intruder. A Canadian sub was given their new instructions. They were to divert from their patrol and instead lie low with their engines off, and completely silent. The crew could no longer use the cooking equipment either, having to temporarily subsist on a diet of cold cheese sandwiches.\n\nFinally, the sonar operator picked up the U-boat. The Canadian submarine soon had a clear picture of the enemy. And as it traveled overhead with no hesitation or change in course, the Canadian crew could smile. They now had found and begun to track a Nazi submarine with no detection by the opposing side. If a war would break out, the OFN had this incredible advantage. And with the increased vigilance now, they would be ready in the event of a real conflict."

He would need to be quick and lucky if he was to bring a story back to the Times.\n\nLuck happened to be on his side, when he spotted an encampment of Resistance soldiers milling about, on patrol. They raised their weapons, but seeing his camera, happily invited him to talk. Three of them on patrol, of three different ideologies. A lithe man with an upper-class accent introduced himself as William, and proudly announced that he was fighting for the Queen's return. A giant of a man, Jack, followed with a gruff pronouncement of his Socialist ideals. The last one, Henry, barely Sixteen, paraded ideals of liberty, ideals of which he had never truly experienced. Despite their different views, all three of the men laughed heartily with each other, brothers in the Resistance. This would be a winning story, Eddie knew; the common bond of anti-fascism breaking creating an unlikely friendship. As they all posed for the picture, Jack embracing the other two, smiles gleaming on the faces of all three, Eddie snapped the shot...\n\nNot a moment after, a deafening crack echoed across the field, and Eddie was thrown backwards. Bleeding, Eddie looked for his camera, and found that it was miraculously unbroken. Looking towards the subjects of his last photograph, though, he found that they were anything but. Eddie knew that, if he ever got his pictures developed, it would show the last moments of three men. On the ground, near the bodies, Eddie waited an eternity for the battle to end. It seemed that the Government forces had won, and a group of mean-faced soldiers approached him. Eddie knew that this was the end, that he would be killed, here and now. That is, until they asked him if he could take their picture. Eddie rapidly nodded, and watched as the three collaborators took their spots right where William, Jack, and Henry had once stood."

Not before talking, of course. Talking about how they'd run away together, escape to America, live in a big city far away from this town where everyone lived grey lives. There was no place for them in England.\n\nThe bell rang, jolting her from warm hazel orbs and soft pink lips. As everyone walked out the door in unison, Matilda trailed behind. She waited by the wall for the other students to leave. The coast was clear. Matilda snuck around to their secret meeting spot when she caught a subtle sobbing. Olivia was sitting against a wall in an almost fetal position, face nestled in her legs.\n\n"Olivia?" Matilda whispered.\nOlivia sniffed.

The rest of the students had cleared off, and here she was, behind the bike sheds, waiting again. Olivia always arrived first, Matilda was always the careful one. Olivia wondered how she'd take the big news, but Matilda always promised to always be with her, after all.\n\nAnd there she was. Matilda trudged around the corner, looking clearly exhausted after a difficult final exam. She sat down next to Olivia and leant on her shoulder, breathing out.\n"You look tense," said Olivia smilingly.\nMatilda, smiling already, laughed a tad. "That could be considered an understatement. How do you assume you did?" she replied. "Eh, why bother? I probably failed. But... darling?"\n"What is it, Olivia?" Matilda said quizzically, moving up from Olivia's shoulder.\n"I want to join the Resistance."\n"The terrorists? Why would you ever want to join that awful organisation, Olivia, you should know better than that!"\n"They aren't terrorists. Listen, I have a mate in the resistance, his name is Paul. The government has only lied and spread mistruths about them, and I want to fight for what's right!"\n"Olivia... you can't-"\n"Mattie, you know there's no future for us like this.

Inside there was a man looking to be in his fifties reading the newspaper at the till.\n\nThe man in the raincoat searches the shop to see if there was anyone else around. He turns towards the person reading the newspapers. They whisper together for a second, the man at the till nods, and he opens a door slightly hidden behind some clutter. The man in the raincoat nods at the girls to follow, and gestures at the girls to mind the step as they enter.\n\nThey entered a small, dingy room, with another man at a table at the back. The man looks around slightly, and looks at the man in the raincoat derisively. "Two women, Paul?" He snickers.\n"Oh, come on, Geoffries, it's not like they're the first you've taken in." Paul said, pulling down the hood of his raincoat. Olivia tries to speak up, but is interrupted.\n"We're supposed to be protecting the women and children, and you bring me two young girls"\n"Geoffries, they can fire a gun. That's all you need, isn't it?""I suppose." Geoffries mused. He looks up at the girls. "Names?" Olivia piped up first."Olivia Adler."\n"Very good. And you?" he said, pointing his pen at Matilda. "Matilda Lewis."\n"Mmhmm."\nAnd so it went. Geoffries asked the women questions, they answered. They ranged from the obvious to the obscure. But in the end, it came down to one question.\n\n"Are you prepared to give anything for a free England?"\n"Yes, I am."\n"I am."\n"Excellent! Ladies, welcome to Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance.""

She collapsed onto Paul's dilapidated, lumpy couch. He had let them stay in his ratty flat, which was nice of him considering the fact that they had just ran away from home. Matilda wondered if her parents were searching for her... were they worried? She shook it off. Don't think about them. They... they'll forget her eventually. At least she hoped they would. She started to tear up despite herself.\n"Matilda?"\nMatilda rubbed her eyes and blinked. "Oh, sorry Olivia, was just getting lost in my thoughts."\nOlivia sat down on the couch next to Matilda, practically falling on it. "Your legs?" Matilda asked. "Yeah."\n"God, it was fucking brutal, wasn't it?"\n"I swear on my life, we won't be able to walk in two weeks, let alone shoot some policemen."\n\nAnd so the evening moved on. They had a lot to talk about, after all. They had been through the looking glass at that point, two 19-year-old girls in a seaside city joining what had been called a terrorist organisation.\n\n"So my dad, right, he ties the boat up, and the knot slips, and I go floating out onto the lake!"\nThe story wasn't very funny, but Matilda laughed anyway. "You're amazing, Olivia!" she said, still grinning. "I know." Olivia replied confidently.\nMatilda leans back, stretching. "I am bloody exhausted."

Her hands shook slightly, her pulse quickening with every step into the factory. She held her breath slightly, trying not to make a sound. She glanced around the corner. It was full of workers, but more importantly, four police officers, positioned around the front entrance. They were prepared. Have the police been intercepting their radio transmissions?\n\nShe ducks back around the corner, and holds up four fingers to the men behind her. They nod, and two of them duck behind the back firing two gunshots in the air. Hearing the shots, two of the guards ran out the front door, going expeditiously around the back for an ambush. Two more of her comrades run inside. "This factory is now under occupation of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance! Surrender now, or we will not be afraid to use lethal force!" The officers, caught off guard, fired randomly and missed, before being immediately accosted with the barrel of a gun to their heads. Workers scattered, while Olivia ran to secure the front door.\n\nIt was too late. A guard stumbled through the front door before she could get to it. Olivia staggered backwards, shocked, before a bullet tore through her leg. It... burned. Why did it fucking burn? A girlish scream erupted from her mouth. She fell to the ground unconscious. Her comrades immediately retaliated, lodging a bullet in the officer's skull. The two guards who were hostaged dropped their weapon while shouting of surrender. "Get the girl, get the ammunition and go." one of the partisans mutter, glancing over his shoulder at the rest of them behind him. And thus HMMLR sweeps into the night, carrying a casualty home."

At least she wasn't dead. She had more time with Olivia yet. But there was a certain level of fear within her, a feeling that wouldn't leave, no matter what she told herself.\n\n"Miss Lewis? Please come with me."\n As Matilda stepped through the door, she glanced around. Walls were all white, all sterile and bland. Matilda was almost blinded as she followed the nurse through the hospital, before entering a door, placed at the end of a corridor. Inside was Olivia, her leg in a splint. "Hello, Matilda." She smiled weakly, her eyes lighting up. "How are you today?" Matilda turns to the nurse. "Excuse me, but could you please-" Matilda's voice cracks. "Could you please give us some time alone?"

They were probably going to break in soon. Many men had already coordinated plans for escape, or even surrender. She had her own ideas, of course. She had already accepted that she might die today. She hoped that somewhere... Olivia was thinking of her. Matilda breathed in. Do it for her.\n\nThe door burst down. Matilda ducked behind a bench near the back of the hall, anticipating a gunshot. Bullets began to fly as screams echoed around the dusty hall. Matilda nodded at all the men she could see, all also ducking behind the pews. Three men. The only way they could ever get out of this was by being very, very careful. As footsteps drew closer to the benches, Matilda looked through the crack at the bottom of each bench and counted the feet she could see. 1, 2, 3... 4. Four men? Matilda grimaced. They were outnumbered. It would take a miracle to escape. Matilda said her prayers as the enemy soldiers checked the pews. She prayed for a miracle, and if she couldn't have a miracle, well... she prayed for Olivia. She smirked a little bit. God hated her. At least, that's what all the priests said. She heard another loud bang of a gun, followed by the eerie sound of a corpse collapsing to the ground. Matilda held her breath and peeked out of the edge of the pews.\n\nIn front of her was a leg. She turned from her side to her stomach. She wanted her to go down with a fight? Matilda gritted her teeth and prepared for the blast.\nA bang.\nThe man fell. The rest of the soldiers, shocked, ran to his aid. They fired wildly. Conscripts, clearly. "Up and at 'em, boys!" screamed Matilda, hopefully exuding more confidence than she was feeling.

Even after a victory, life would forever be in a place of misery and pain, of hatred and misfortune. But then, came Stonewall. The Americans stood up for something. They were brave, they believed in themselves. And all of a sudden, we did too. People across the country rose up. And instead of twiddling their thumbs, they did something for us. And for the first time in history, homosexuals in England, Gays and Lesbians, were free.\n\nI have to go now, my wife is calling me for tea. If you're reading this, always remember. There's always hope, there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd there'll always be someone to help you to the end of it. "

ENG_Wales_unification.1.t:0 "The Welsh Issue"
ENG_Wales_unification.1.desc:0 "[ENG.GetLeader] has deemed England able to expand, Wales will soon become its likely target. The nation has been a mess from the start and will likely have no other option than to join us. Afterall, they are fully aware of the measures we will be willing to use if they were to dare to defy us.\n\nThey would have to be led by some sort of mad man to decline.\n\nThe time for unification talks with the Welsh are upon us, a letter will be sent to Cardiff immediately to get the process started."
ENG_Wales_unification.1.a:0 "What choice do they have?"
                                                                

ENG_Wales_unification.2.t:0 "The English Demands"
ENG_Wales_unification.2.desc:0 "A letter has arrived in Cardiff from across the eastern border, it is from the English government and they have demanded that we begin the unification process. This has not been an unexpected moment yet it is one that we would have rather avoided. The English army is ready to enforce their demands, therefore the government will have to think carefully before they make up their mind.\n\nMany have already accepted that the dream of an independent Welsh Republic is over, and that we will soon awaken to the new English reality. To decline would mean suicide, but the government will have to do what is best for the people of Wales."
ENG_Wales_unification.2.a:0 "We have no choice."
ENG_Wales_unification.2.b:0 "Wales will be free forever!"

ENG_Wales_unification.3.t:0 "The Delegations Meet"
ENG_Wales_unification.3.desc:0 "The English delegations arrived in Cardiff soon after they had been accepted. The keenness of the English to reassert their control over Wales was obvious, however there was nothing that could prevent them now.\n\nNo time was wasted in taking pictures of the two sides together for the frontpages of tomorrow's newspapers. All the images would show everyone present beaming and ready to get on with the business of unification.\n\nYet [ENG.GetLeader] was slightly surprised to catch the Welsh Prime Minister looking so dejected once they had moved on from the flash of the press. Perhaps things were not exactly as the English would have liked, but they thought it best to get on with the job at hand. Best not to let the mind linger on such things."
ENG_Wales_unification.3.a:0 "They just need some convincing."

ENG_Wales_unification.4.t:0 "The English Delegation Arrives"
ENG_Wales_unification.4.desc:0 "I did not take long for the English to send their negotiators over to Cardiff, their enthusiasm was even seen as vulgar as some. But little could be done to stop them now. It was obvious that the English were now entirely in control of what followed from here on out.\n\nThe flash of a camera captured the moment, the Welsh did their best to look as optimistic as they could. The unfortunate truth was some of them had regrets even as they entered the negotiation room.\n\nEven [ENG.GetLeader] momentarily let his facade drop, but for little longer than a second, fearing that the English Prime Minister might have caught him. No matter, he thought, it would not have changed much even if they had."
ENG_Wales_unification.4.a:0 "Let's get on with it."
                                                      

ENG_Wales_unification.5.t:0 "Set the Tone"
ENG_Wales_unification.5.desc:0 "Negotiations with the English got off to an acceptable start, but the English felt like the Welsh had to be reminded who was in control. A demand would have to be made and Wales would have to, in turn, accept it.\n\nThe target of the order would be the Welsh Army. The English suspected it to still be a hotbed for nationalist activity, which would inevitably have to be removed come unification anyway. Thus Welsh demilitarisation became the first key issue of the negotiations.\n\nThe Welsh delegation were also reminded that if they refused, no further actions would be off limits, and Wales would have to suffer the consequences. If they would not demilitarise, the English would be more than happy to do it for them."
ENG_Wales_unification.5.a:0 "The end of the Welsh Army."
ENG_Wales_unification.5.b:0 "Come and take it."

ENG_Wales_unification.6.t:0 "The Welsh Demilitarise"
ENG_Wales_unification.6.desc:0 "The Welsh were quick in sending their reply back to the English. They had unsurprisingly accepted the demand of demilitarisation and assured the English that they had already begun disarming their soldiers.\n\nWales is now vulnerable to the wills of the English, there is nothing left to protect it and the Welsh people have all but surrendered themselves to the English as a result.\n\nBut what choice did their government have?\n\nAll things considered, it would be better for them to disarm peacefully now than suffer the harmful consequences of defiance in the future."
ENG_Wales_unification.6.a:0 "A dragon without its flame."
                                                              

ENG_Wales_unification.7.t:0 "Surrendering Our Markets"
ENG_Wales_unification.7.desc:0 "Next on the English agenda came the need to integrate the Welsh economy into England's. Such a change could actually become a benefit for the people of Wales and would welcome an influx of English goods.\n\nHowever, many smaller Welsh businesses would be put at risk of simply being outcompeted by their English counterparts. Unemployment in the region would rise substantially, something that would take a great deal of time to recover from.\n\nTo refuse the English demands would again risk war, but without an army how could such a battle be fought? Time is running out and the crown will soon seize total control and there is increasingly little that can be done to stop it."
ENG_Wales_unification.7.a:0 "Let them in."
ENG_Wales_unification.7.b:0 "Maybe it is not too late?"

ENG_Wales_unification.8.t:0 "Access to Welsh Markets"
ENG_Wales_unification.8.desc:0 "After their willingness to lay down their arms, nobody within the English delegation was surprised to hear that Wales had surrendered its markets too. Another stage toward the eventual integration of all of Wales had been taken and England was already starting to profit.\n\nMerging the two economies would be a quick and painless process for the English but likely would be a more troublesome experience for the Welsh. Yet no one in England's government felt much regret for having to force such an ordeal on to Wales.\n\nIn their eyes it was the Welsh government's fault for betraying the English Crown all those years ago. If they had not left then they would not have had to suffer the ramifications now."
ENG_Wales_unification.8.a:0 "Another step closer."

ENG_Wales_unification.9.t:0 "We Will Make Our Demands"
ENG_Wales_unification.9.desc:0 "By this point of the negotiations the Welsh were sick of accepting the demands of the English. They had acted in good faith, but where had that led them? Now Wales was without an army and an economy which was slowly dying before its eyes. Things could not go on this way forever, Wales would have to stand up for itself. They would request that Wales be granted autonomy, yet remain underneath the English crown.\n\nSome thought it foolish to make a stand against the English so late.\n\nHowever, the demands had already been sent, there was nothing left to do beside wait, and hope that whatever limited sympathies the English had for Wales allowed them to accept their offer."
ENG_Wales_unification.9.a:0 "The last hope of Wales."
                                                             

ENG_Wales_unification.10.t:0 "The Welsh Demands"
ENG_Wales_unification.10.desc:0 "It was strange for the English negotiators to realise that for once they would be the ones receiving demands, not the Welsh. The message they received requested that Wales receive a degree of autonomy after it is reunified with England.\n\nSome of the English allowed themselves to be persuaded, because Wales would still be bought under the English crown. If they could avoid a needless war and bring Wales into the fold then there would be no reason to decline.\n\nOthers were of an altogether different mind. Wales have no army, what other response could they expect in response to such an insolent demand.\n\nEither way the choice would have to be made, and the fate of Wales would be decided in the process."
ENG_Wales_unification.10.a:0 "Grant them autonomy."
ENG_Wales_unification.10.b:0 "They will pay for this."

ENG_Wales_unification.11.t:0 "Unification at Last"
ENG_Wales_unification.11.desc:0 "With the final issue of Welsh autonomy resolved, the agreement was ready to be signed and with it the death of the Welsh Republic would soon become official. The Welsh and English people would be united once more, and neither side would have to suffer a drop of blood.\n\nBoth sides gathered round the table pens in hand and a copy of the agreement before each of the leaders. [ENG.GetLeader] looked down upon the document, it was good enough they thought, nothing worth dying over, but good enough.\n\nThey raised thier hand and with the stroke of a pen, the Welsh dream died."
ENG_Wales_unification.11.a:0 "All things come to end."

ENG_Wales_unification.12.t:0 "The Border Opens"
ENG_Wales_unification.12.desc:0 "For the first time in twenty years, the border between Wales and England was open and both their peoples were united again. Little celebration could be seen, but somewhere in Westminster, the English delegation cheered at the news. The United Kingdom of the past was not dead yet and they still had a chance to revive it.\n\nYet back in Wales much was changing. The first few Englishmen had crossed the border and had already taken a great interest in Wales. For them Wales was seen as a land of opportunity, not one of dull stagnation that the locals had grown to tolerate. These locals were also greatly disgruntled to see the wave of the English arrive, Wales may have been a miserable place to live, but at least it was theirs.\n\nSomewhere over the rooftops of Cardiff an English flag flies and all is slowly forgotten."
ENG_Wales_unification.12.a:0 "Peace Survives in England"

ENG_Wales_unification.13.t:0 "The End"
ENG_Wales_unification.13.desc:0 "So the hope of a Welsh Republic was over.\n\nAnd it had been nothing more than a hope. For all the years of its corruption, its feigned democracy and its tensions running high had always meant naught. As England lied on its border,waiting for the time it would awaken, knowing it would not lay dormant forever. England was bound to rear its head again and come back for Wales once more.\n\nYet peace in the valleys of Wales would and endure and for all its flaws, Wales dies peacefully."
ENG_Wales_unification.13.a:0 "It's all over."

ENG_Wales_unification.14.t:0 "Wales Reject's Our Demands!"
ENG_Wales_unification.14.desc:0 "Wales has sent its response and to the immense surprise of the English negotiators, their demands have been rejected.\n\nNevertheless, England will press forward, the time for talking may be over but reunification will not be postponed. Those in power in England believe they have been left with no other option than to declare war. The English army was positioned along the border for a reason.\n\nWar will take over where peace could have reigned. Neither side sees themselves as responsible for what will come next, though both will inevitably suffer."
ENG_Wales_unification.14.a:0 "For England!"

ENG_Wales_unification.144.t:0 "England Refuses Autonomy"
ENG_Wales_unification.144.desc:0 "The English reply was the opposite of what the Welsh government had been hoping for. Their suggestion of the English granting Wales some autonomy had been rejected and the future of Wales had become exceedingly uncertain.\n\nYet the likely result of Welsh autonomy would be a continued deterioration of the situation, as talks between the two nations would probably break down. What is worse is the reports that have already started to emerge suggesting that the English have doubled down on their rejection and sent in their army to finalize the unification.\n\nThe Welsh government can at least be sure that it had tried its best to do what was best for Wales. Yet in doing so it may have lost everything."
ENG_Wales_unification.144.a:0 "To war."

ENG_Wales_unification.15.t:0 "The English Attack!"
ENG_Wales_unification.15.desc:0 "News of an English invasion has been anticipated the moment after the rejection of their demands had been sent. There has been very little time to prepare and only limited defenses exist to protect the nation. The English soldiers march forward and conflict is now inevitable.\n\nNo one wished that it would come to this, but the final moments of the Welsh nation are upon us. The Welsh now have a choice between death or acceptance, as they all know that the English Army is much more vast than that of Wales.\n\nFew expect Wales to last much longer, but at least it will not go quietly."
ENG_Wales_unification.15.a:0 "Long live Wales."

ENG_Wales_unification.16.t:0 "The Effects of Unification"
ENG_Wales_unification.16.desc:0 "Now that some time has passed since unification was finally realised its effects have started to be felt by the people of Wales. Initially nothing much changed, the shops stayed open and they spoke the same language as before. Many even wondered what all the fuss had been about to begin with.\n\nHowever, this would change; English goods would fill the shelves of Welsh stores, joblessness became increasingly common and with less people to sell to, the stores shut down too. An influx of English arriving in the country would also make the Welsh language worthless, wiping out much of the local country with it.\n\nA way of life was passing away in front of them, one they had never thought they would miss and there was nothing they could do to stop it from fading away. "
ENG_Wales_unification.16.a:0 "They're stuck with us now."

ENG_Wales_unification.17.t:0 "The Drums of War"
ENG_Wales_unification.17.desc:0 "Wales has refused to even host talks with the English over the topic of unification. Clearly more aggressive measures will have to be utilised in order to bring about unification with Wales. Measures which the English have made clear that they would not shy away from.\n\nCayo and his damned clique of nationalist terrorisers will be put down. They will not stand a chance against the might of the English military. The English army will require some time to prepare, but given time Cayo's men will all be retreating from the cause they claimed they would die for.\n\nThose in England are all in one mind over how all this will end:"
ENG_Wales_unification.17.a:0 "Wales will fall."

ENG_Wales_unification.18.t:0 "Calling Up the Reserves"
ENG_Wales_unification.18.desc:0 "War has become unavoidable, the Free Wales Army will no doubt be prepared to defend their homeland with a degree of ferocity few would have expected from the Welsh. If the English are to avoid all out humiliation at the hands of the FWA more men will have to be called up to do their duty. The nation's reserves will help bring the fight to the Welsh.\n\nThe General's of the English armed forces are keen to avoid even the slightest chance of humiliation at the hands of the Welsh. England's army may dwarf its Welsh counterpart but this action is seen as necessary to bolster its ranks of soldiers and overwhelm the defenders of Wales.\n\nNothing will be left to chance."
ENG_Wales_unification.18.a:0 "More must serve."

ENG_Wales_unification.19.t:0 "Ready the RAF"
ENG_Wales_unification.19.desc:0 "One of England's greatest advantages over the Free Wales Army is the fact that it has an air force at its disposal. Limited as the Royal Air Force may be, it will still be of significant use come the time of the invasion.\n\nTherefore, more warplanes will be stationed in the airfields closest to Wales and they will prepare to take to the skies and rain hell upon the Welsh. This may well be one of the first times many of our pilots will see active combat, these men will especially need extra training before the time of the invasion.\n\nThe roar of English engines would soon be heard all over Wales, and one could only imagine that it would shake the Welsh people to their cores."
ENG_Wales_unification.19.a:0 "Take to the skies."

ENG_Wales_unification.20.t:0 "Testing the Welsh"
ENG_Wales_unification.20.desc:0 "Given the Welsh's enduring stubbornness to accept English hegemony, a plan has been drawn up to start a small scale attack on the Welsh border. This fight will draw out the soldiers of the Free Wales Army and enable the English to realise how capable they really are. An English victory is, of course, the expected outcome.\n\nYet in the unlikely event of an FWA victory, the English army will be greatly dismayed, and the government will also be embarrassed.\n\nGunfire will be exchanged and soldiers will fall; but whatever the outcome, war will follow and it will be much more bloody than a simple skirmish."
ENG_Wales_unification.20.a:0 "Launch the attack."

ENG_Wales_unification.21.t:0 "Victory at the Border"
ENG_Wales_unification.21.desc:0 "Reports have been sent back from the Welsh border about the result of the border conflict. They conclude that little remains of the men the Free Wales Army had stationed in the area, the attack has been a success and the Welsh military has been significantly weakened as a result.\n\nThe rest of Wales is now wide open to an attack. England has confirmed that its forces are vastly superior and will likely begin its invasion of the whole of Wales shortly. The soldiers are ready and soon they will march on Wales.\n\nNothing can stop them now, Wales will fall."
ENG_Wales_unification.21.a:0 "No surprise there."

ENG_Wales_unification.22.t:0 "Defeat at the Border"
ENG_Wales_unification.22.desc:0 "In shock that has likely surprised both sides equally, the Free Wales Army has emerged triumphant from the border conflict. Raucous celebrations could be heard from the Welsh side of the border as the English had to turn and beat an embarrassing defeat. The Welsh soldiers will likely be greatly enthused with the news of their victory over the English.\n\nThis defeat may momentarily be demoralising for the English soldiers but the sting of defeat will probably not last long. This failed skirmish will certainly be used as a justification for all out war to be declared against Wales.\n\nThey may have beaten England this time, but it is unlikely they will succeed again."
ENG_Wales_unification.22.a:0 "A surprise, to be sure."

ENG_Wales_unification.23.t:0 "War is Declared"
ENG_Wales_unification.23.desc:0 "Since the outcome of the border conflict was announced, on both sides of the border, troops and civilians alike have been awaiting the start of the inevitable English invasion. The Free Wales Army has had some time to prepare, but it will no doubt struggle to hold off the advancing English, all the while harried by enemy aerial superiority.\n\nHowever, the excruciating wait will soon be over. The order to attack will be ordered from the English High Command and the English army will march into Wales.\n\nFew will regret the passing of the FWA's grip over Wales, the dream of a Welsh Republic is long since dead and what is left will soon be put out of its misery,"
ENG_Wales_unification.23.a:0 "Death to the FWA"
#Cornwall Events
ENG_Cornwall.1.t:0 "A Shameful Display"
ENG_Cornwall.1.d:0 "Oberst Karl Fischer held his head in his hands as he watched the spectacle that unfolded in front of him. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery had proposed joint military exercises between the Cornwall Garrison troops and the native English forces, having wanted to determine combat readiness in the face of the renewed threat from the HMMLR rebels in the north. The Generaloberst had agreed, and a date had been scheduled for wargames to begin.\n\nThe results thus far had been less than satisfactory.\n\nFrom the box atop a hill overlooking the area that had been chosen to conduct the wargame, Fischer and a number of other officers watched as the English soldiers bumbled their way through the various scenarios. One particular event of note was when an English captain had been tasked with searching a mock village for garrison soldiers. The captain had immediately overstretched, causing his soldiers to be picked off one by one. Having sent even his staff away, he was left standing alone outside the village, and had been captured by the opposition forces. When he had complained about being outside the area of engagement when he had been captured, he was quieted when reminded that the terrorists did not play fair.\n\n"I've seen cadets more disciplined than this rabble," an Oberstleutnant commented, watching a squad fumbling around trying to load an artillery shell, "I know we thrashed them soundly during the war, but this is shameful."\n\nOberst Fischer had to agree with his subordinate. "The English have grown fat and soft without a proper enemy to fight," he replied, "At their current level of operation, those HMMLR partisans will crush them. There's only one thing to do: we must teach them, they must be ready to overcome any enemy they might face."\n\nMurmuring their agreement, the assembled officers turned back towards the proceedings."
ENG_Cornwall.1.a:0 "Let's get down to business."
ENG_Cornwall.2.t:0 "조짐 좋은 보고서"
ENG_Cornwall.2.d:0 "클로드 오친렉은 앉아서 스파이들이 전달한 보고서를 읽었습니다. 그는 자신이 느끼는 즐거움을 감추기 위해 차를 한 모금 마시는 것은 신사답지 못한 행동이라고 생각했습니다. 일종의 씁쓸한 유쾌함입니다; 그가 읽고 있던 보고서에 따르면, 한때 영국의 위대한 군대는 대열에 합류하는 것 외에는 할 줄 아는 게 없는 횡설수설한 멍청이 무리로 전락했다는 겁니다. 먼저 있었던 보고에 따르면 그마저도 힘들다고 합니다.\n\n"이 보고서들이 정확한 게 확실한 건가?" 그가 보고서를 건네준 스파이에게 묻습니다.\n\n"예, 모의전을 진행하는 것을 보았습니다."라고 스파이가 대답합니다. "끝내주는 광경이었습니다. 간신히 대형을 이루고 움직이는 게 불쌍하기 그지없더군요."\n\n오친렉은 흥얼거리며 서류를 훑어보더니 차를 한 모금 더 마셨습니다. 모든 면에서 모의전은 참담했던 것 같았습니다; 이것은 영국인의 무능함을 놀라울 정도로 보여주었습니다. "이대로 간다면," 그는 생각에 잠깁니다. "영국군은 대규모 봉기를 진압할 수 없을 것 같군."\n\n"제가 보기론" 스파이가 웃으면서 말합니다. "녀석들은 무장 봉기는 고사하고, 훌리건 무리도 간신히 진압할 겁니다."\n\n오친렉이 인상을 찌부립니다. "문제는 언제나 독일놈들이야. 무슨 짓을 벌이는 지 잘 알고 있으니까."\n\n스파이는 "우리 수가 많으니, 콘월 주둔군 자체로는 인력이 충분하지 않을 겁니다. 놈들이 더 잘 훈련되어 있더라도, 우린 머릿수로 간단하게 제압할 수 있을 겁니다."라고 주장합니다.\n\n오친렉은 "그게 요점이 아니네"라며, "독일놈들은 우리가 봤던 것과 정확히 같은 보았을 것이고, 아마 똑같은 결론에 도달했을 것이네. 우리가 여기 있다는 것을 알면서도 영국군을 바보처럼 가만히 둘 것이라고 생각한다면, 잘못 생각한 걸세. 우리는 준비가 필요해...""
ENG_Cornwall.2.a:0 "아니면 결과를 받아들일 뿐이다."
ENG_Cornwall.3.t:0 "Cornwall Demands"
ENG_Cornwall.3.d:0 "The English government is under siege, constantly under attack by enemies from both outside and within. We already have enough problems dealing with the Rebel pest, and now we face pressure on another front. Today, we received a message from the Cornwall Garrison specifying a series of demands to be fulfilled as soon as possible.\n\nThis seems like an attempt by General Halder to exercise more control over us. However, in our current situation, satisfying these demands would be the best course of action. Whatever the case, we need to deal with this unforeseen situation fast."
ENG_Cornwall.3.a:0 "What does he want now?"
ENG_Cornwall.4.t:0 "Getting Used"
ENG_Cornwall.4.d:0 ""This must be a fucking joke," Bernard Montgomery cursed angrily, almost ripping the piece of paper on his hands. Behind him, Field Marshal Templer was equally apoplectic with rage by the news but tried to keep his composure. Murmuring insults and sweating uncontrollably, the other generals at the English High Command were also furious.\n\n"The Cornwall Garrison is abandoning us to the rebels and stealing our equipment! This is asinine!" Montgomery yelled, throwing the paper over the desk with anger. For a moment, he empathized with the rebels. Putting their trust in the Germans to put things in order was a great mistake.\n\n"From what my sources have gathered, apparently they say that is some kind of strategic retreat, and the equipment is for anti-partisan purposes," Templer exposed. But Montgomery was fixated on the map in front of him, with his hands firmly grabbing the desk. The German retreat left so many gaps in their defenses, especially without tanks and heavy artillery. How are they going to even replace the lost equipment?\n\n"In other words, they are kindly telling us to fuck off," Marshal Templer also added. Freezing for a few seconds to reflect, Montogomery decided to go back to the drawing board. Empathy or not, the rebels needed to be crushed for the good of England.\n\n"To hell with those bastards from Cornwall. It looks like we are on our own. Marshal Templer; we need to delineate a new strategy based on our remaining resources.""
ENG_Cornwall.4.a:0 "German treachery never stops."
ENG_Cornwall.5.t:0 "Field Report"
ENG_Cornwall.5.d:0 "A dozen men continued to run around the camp, heavily breathing on the cold English morning. In the distance, the mortars roared, accurately hitting their marks. Meanwhile, another group practiced with rifles, destroying the ragdolls' heads one by one in a perfect synchronized fashion.\n\nDressed in his impeccable military uniform proudly displaying the Iron Cross, Field Marshal Frank Halder witnessed this spectacle alongside his English counterpart, satisfied. "I have to admit, Marshal, I'm impressed at how well you have trained your men. These men could have stood a better chance against us."\n\n"No thanks to you, prick." Marshal Templer thought to himself. "I appreciate the compliment, Mr. Halder. We have trained our forces with the highest of standards," he exclaimed, displaying a forced smile.\n\nThe men running through the obstacle course continued the exercise, climbing ropes and crawling on the ground. "I feel confident that these men will crush the rebels, and we'll provide the equipment you need," Halder said extending his hand.\n\nAs the two officers shook their hands, Templer thought about how to deal with the Cornwall issue in the future."

But they were men who would fight and die together to see the Nazis removed from England.\n\nThere were Claude's own HMMLR forces, men who had joined up with him from inside the collaborationist government. They sat on the reformist wing of the Royal Party, but they secretly pledged their lives for when the time came to establish a new, free England under Her Majesty Elizabeth II. Their two most influential members, Enoch Powell and George Jellicoe, joined him today.\n\nThere were also his allies in the SAS. David Stirling had never stopped fighting the Hun, and he had no intent on doing so as long as he still drew breath. He had gathered a powerful and skilled force, strong enough to go toe-to-toe with any unit in the Wehrmacht or the collaborationist army. His forces had an extreme hatred for anything collaborationist, and wished to drive them out even more than Claude did. He was accompanied by Arthur Harris, who was organizing what he ominously called "a little present for Jerry."\n\nAnd finally, the Left Resistance. Born out of the ashes of Cable Street, this new organization was a coalition of the surviving communists, Labour members, and other hard leftists under the leadership of Bill Alexander. Despite being a staunch communist, Bill had brought in the more moderate Harold Wilson to solidify his standing with the social democrats. He was even willing to collaborate with HMMLR, somehow stomaching working alongside the rabidly anti-communist Stirling.\n\nClaude looked at each of these faces one last time before he began to speak.

As Home looked out from his office onto the streets of London he noted that the majority of the citizenry would likely not know what he did for some days.

He didn't know how to feel about it at first, so he talked to them little outside of giving them meals and spent most of his time wondering whether his uncle's shop was still standing. They were an odd bunch, and after several weeks of waiting for their turn to go to trial Roger had learned a fair bit about them.\n\nThe Officer had deserted with his battalion when HMMLR had first risen, not for pay or even any feeling of kinship with the HMMLR men, but because he'd lost a son in the war twenty years back and he wouldn't have gotten so good a chance for revenge again. The factory worker claimed he'd just wanted to get back at the men who spat down on him day after day and ensured his father died penniless after an accident took his knee.

It was evident why Home was really here then, he wanted the assurances of England's highest ranking officer that nothing untoward would interfere with whichever politician's ambition landed them in Downing Street.

On top of all this at some point the buffoon Chesterton got a pair of shoes thrown at him.

Although many believe this will be a problem with the SLP as well, since they have a vocal communist block.\n\nHarold Wilson's crusade against the great evils that damn the people of England to poverty and want is sure to go ahead with a roaring start. Although several years of NDL rule will be hard to remove entirely, especially for a man who has otherwise gotten on well with them. This may upset the hardliners in the party, and what happens when socialist dreams meet English reality is something many surely dread."

ENG_Government_Changes.12.desc:0 "Elections in postwar England have usually been something of a formality, rather than an actual gauge of public opinion. But two equally shocking events have occurred in them. The rise of the new United England party ended years of domination by the ruling Royal Party. But now, the Royal Party is back, and they are none too pleased about what United England has done with their time in charge.\n\nPolitical defeats have hampered United England and its reformist policies. Their dream of a more liberal and democratic government has fallen flat on its face, and the consequences for them were dire. Their failure to neutralize the Royal Party doubtlessly was a mistake that will haunt them for the rest of English history as well.\n\nThe Royal Party has been vague, but it's widely expected they wish to crush the remnants of the United England party. The new PM, Margaret Thatcher, is not merciful, and is known for taking out any threats to her hold on the party when they were in opposition. For the longest time, the party in charge of England abuses their power to crush the opposition. And now, it is expected that United England will face an angry revenge from the party they tried to destroy."

ENG_Government_Changes.13.desc:0 "Many people saw Margaret Thatcher and the Royal Party as an unstoppable force in English politics. The Royal Party was a formidable organization, with broad support among the electorate, kept by mass surveillance and a carefully selected group of voters. Margaret Thatcher herself was widely viewed as imposing, able to offer charismatic speeches, populist reforms, and dynamite any obstacles in her path. Certainly, nobody expected them to yield power once they grabbed onto it. But tonight, the Iron Lady collapsed in a pile of rust.\n\nThe main opposition party, United England, seemed to be on its way out after its break up with the Royal Party and its electoral failure after the war. But apparently many underestimated the organization's tenacity, some at their own peril. The reformist organization somehow not only eked out a victory, they did it in the cutthroat and oppressive world of modern English politics, where organized opposition is mostly regarded as a joke.\n\nWhoever won the election would certainly grind the other party into the dirt, but it seems the UE will be doing the stomping, instead of Thatcher. They are certain to go to work scaling back or outright abolishing her most grievous offenses, and making sure the Royal Party never comes close to a position of power again. And if they do establish a true democracy, it is clear the Royal Party will play no part in it."

I urge all members of this body to support it so we may form a new government to lead the nation forward in these trying times."\n\nWith that, Rab Butler returned to his bench. The Deputy PM's betrayal had been a shock to nearly everyone in the chamber, but certainly not an unwelcome one to Thatcher's many enemies. Over the next several hours the thatcherites howled from the backbenches as Old Guard defectors and opposition MPs spoke, and Thatcher herself raged against Butler and his allies in her defense. But the House of Commons finally went quiet as the Speaker called for a final vote on the motion.\n\nA chorus of ayes rang out in answer.\n\nFor the first time in her life, Margaret Thatcher had no witty retort or hyperbolic broadside at the ready. She merely sat, stunned and defeated as her life's ambitions came crashing down. Eventually she walked out of the House of Commons, paying no mind to the MPs, reporters, and other hanger-ons who followed her to console, to question, to jeer. She walked back to 10 Downing Street with her head held high, and the faintest glimmer of tears on her cheeks."

For how can we claim to have retaken our place in the world if we do not share this prosperity with our western neighbor?\n\nWales formed by a few well-meaning nationalists who wished to escape the fate of the United Kingdom, has found itself in a new mess. One of political instability, economic mismanagement, and extremism. Though it may find temporary respite, disaster always looms large in their minds. And the land suffers as a result.\n\nWe shall come to the Welsh with a new offer. A way out of the instability and economic disaster. A guarantee of their way of life, with representation and protection under the constitution. And special rights afforded to the nation, ones which they were denied before.

And there are the simple economic benefits to free and unrestricted trade between us.\n\nWe will give the Scotts a fair offer. Every freedom, every benefit, every advantage they have, they can keep. We will not seek to enforce a hierarchy like we have done in the past. Our democratic system is open to all.

Hopefully, our promises of cultural and political autonomy (as much as can be allowed for socialism to flourish, anyway) will make the government in Cardiff understand we don't seek to replicate the crimes of past English governments.

The North Sea is one of the richest spots for fishing in Europe, but that is meager compared to its many potential petroleum resources. If we can turn these over to a plurinational working class, British socialism can become just that much more fortified. Their workers cannot wait a second longer for liberation, knowing of course that we will respect their many unique traditions.

Now our worst fears have been realised, the Germans are once again invading our isle, and the threat of retribution is even worse than before.\n\nEngland is, once again, a nation in crisis. There is not one place that has not been thrown into crisis; it seems that hope is fading everywhere. Yet we have no choice but to ready ourselves for war, a war on a scale which we never wished to face again. And though many believe there is little that can be done to save England, we will make certain that the message of our people will be heard throughout the world.\n\nThe past mistakes of the nation will not be repeated.\nIndependence will be retained, surrender is unacceptable.\nFor King and Country, we will fight to the very end.\n\nGod save England."

Entire communities have been left in ruin and all the deep divisions within our society have been displayed to the world. Very few outsiders held any hope for the English government once it had wrestled back control from the traitorous so called 'resistance'.\n\nHowever, one thing that the war has not left the nation short of is competent fighting men; men who are more than ready to fight for their country once more. These soldiers are to be mustered and consolidated into new divisions to be sent off to fight the invaders.\n\nAll of England prays that their poor souls will be saved."

Yet there are those in England who still hold on to the grand achievements of our country's past, no matter how far away they are now.\n\nThere are many more emboldened men who have taken up arms to fight in the final defence of the nation they love. There is little exception to the men who now fight, for it may very well be their final chance to do so; but they will fight.\n\nAt least these Britons shall indeed never be slaves."
 ENG_SL_barricades_on_the_shores_desc:0 "The greatest mistake that the army made during the national tragedy of the German invasion was allowing the Germans to secure a foothold on the British Isles in the first place.

Where there are Germans there will be resistance and when we retreat, the land will be left soaked in the blood of both sides.\n\nAll efforts against the invaders will be redoubled.

An office boardroom can be converted into a sniper or machine gun nest, a storefront into a makeshift pillbox, a police station into a forward command post.

 ENG_SL_hiding_on_hills_desc:0 "Despite how warfare has changed over all of human history, one idea remains constant: holding the high ground brings distinct advantages to combat. A cavalry charge is much easier downhill than uphill, and it is much easier to stab down than up. While the days of hand to hand combat are mostly behind us, holding the high ground still gives us benefits. Height gives us better sightlines, and allows us to shoot down at German soldiers charging uphill. The North of England is full of hilly terrain, perfect to take advantage of holding the high ground. Taking full advantage of this will give us an edge that we so desperately need."

However, the clouds have lifted over our island, and by a miracle, England has survived. The Greater German Reich has collapsed, and they find themselves unable to continue the fight, instead suing for peace. We are unbowed, but not unchanged.

Owing to the tense political situation surrounding the builder's bankruptcy and union disputes, the President has decided it best to allow these submarines to be used by the Royal Navy instead.\n\nAll equipment and ships mentioned above will be sent to Iceland immediately. Once there, you will be allowed to take ownership of the items and place them at your disposal. You will be allowed a small auxiliary force from the OFN to familiarize your forces with the equipment, but all pilots and seamen in combat roles must be provided by your government.\n\nUse them well,\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland"

 ENG_sealion.4.desc:0 "A wave reaches the shore. The body of a German soldier is pushed inland. The waves cross the sand with increasing length. And the German is pushed further and further ashore. Yet, the tide then comes out. The beach is still there, and the German is half-buried in it. And as the tide recedes, the carnage of wrecked Panzers, beached landing craft, and bodies torn by machine gun fire is plain for the world to see.\n\nTrue to the American predictions, the German economy has collapsed, and has brought Göring down with it. Germania is in absolute chaos, and so is most of the continent, for that matter. The Germans lucky enough to have made it off the beach have either surrendered, retreated home, or have been utterly annihilated. Sealion II is an objective failure by any means, and the consequences have been devastating for the Hun who flew too close to the sun.\n\nEngland is not unscathed, however. Bombing has ravaged her cities. Shelling and fighting have left ruins and shell-holes that dot the countryside. The consequences of this destruction are immediately obvious. The economic devastation will be felt for years to come.\n\nBut the buildings would be rebuilt. The shell holes would be plowed over. The pulse of life, growing stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares. And England would rise again, stronger than before, and without any chains to bind her to the will of the Pakt. For with these three disastrous and tense months, England had purchased the right to be a nation worthy of a great power's respect once again."

It's when he proceeded up the elevator and strode in demanding to see the MI6 head that there were issues. The secretary tried to explain that the chief was in the middle of an important meeting. The CIA man didn't care, walking in, shutting the door behind him, and said to the MI6 head and the East Asia Section Chief "you need to see this. Right now."\n\n"Alright," said the MI6 chief. "What's so important that you have to barge in on me?"\n\n"This dispatch from Washington," said the CIA man as he pulled out a dossier from his briefcase, tossing it on the desk. The chief looked it over before opening it up. What he read shocked him to the core.\n\n"My God..." he said in disbelief. "And they're even calling it 'Seelöwe II'? How daft do you have to be to name it Sealion again?"\n\n"Göring isn't subtle," the CIA man said. "He's fucking coming, but we got word about it. What you have here is the report we gave to the President, minus a few inconsequential bits to protect our sources."\n\nThe MI6 head looked it over before grabbing the phone, sighing, and began dialing Number 10 Downing Street.

 FEN_SL_stealing_our_freedom_desc:0 "In 1943 the old United Kingdom was murdered. Cruelly slain for standing up for what was right and just, and it was the German Reich which committed the deed. They took our families, our wealth, our freedom, and now we have received word that they intend to do so once again.\n\nThat fat bastard in Germania Hermann Göring? He intends to do unto England the atrocities for which the word German has become synonymous. He intends not only to destroy our nation but our people too. Yet what are we if not Englishmen? Are we to go meekly into the night? Sobbing like children at the approaching nightmare? No. Our old foe knocks at the door, and behind it we wait with gun in hand, for what else is there to do?"
 FEN_SL_mobilize_the_militias_desc:0 "Even the most ardent opponents of the modern SLP have to admit that their predecessor the Left Resistance fielded the single greatest number of civilian militias of any side in the Civil War. These were vital to our victory, but Bill Alexander supported most of them disarming to keep the post war peace intact. We shall rectify this mistake.\n\nSend out the summons by radio and by car. To each town and factory from London to Carlisle we will call these men back to arms. These militias won't have the best weaponry, but what they lack in modern equipment they make up with the indomitable spirit of the working class. Once more unto the breach we go, turn ploughshares into swords gentlemen and let us remind the Germans that the spirit of 1953 is alive and well."
 FEN_SL_stirlings_men_desc:0 "David Stirling led the only rebel force to fight from the fall until the liberation without interruption. In the course of doing so he created several volunteer units which were demobilised following the end of the Civil War, men that we must now bring back into service for what could be the final battle of English civilisation.\n\nThey have their own arms, but we must find the best positions for these volunteer SAS regiments amidst our own lines so as to best utilize their particular skills. Anywhere that guerilla warfare is necessary would be well served by even a few of these men, for their loyalty to England in unquestionable, and their spirit indomitable. Who dares wins."
 FEN_SL_utilize_ofn_bases_desc:0 "It will take time for the Americans to organise a proper response to the actions of Hermann Göring, time we cannot afford. Yet the American commanders of those units stationed on English soil are amenable to recognising a temporary state of affairs in which we assume command of their forces for the duration of this crisis.\n\nAmerican troops are some of the finest in the world, and their advanced technology will come in exceptionally valuable against the more numerous Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. This battle will be the final test of the English spirit against Germannic barbarism, we will need all the help we can get in this fight. We ask the American government for its permission later."
 FEN_SL_memories_of_hmmlr_desc:0 "HMMLR was always a well organised force, but what truly impressed the outside world was its ability to unite the disparate groups of communists, monarchists and everything in between under a single banner. Where the Republican Spaniards, WRRF and even China have failed we succeeded, and now we will need to bring that spirit back to life once last time.\n\nMostly we can use the memories of the Civil War to organise the same partisan groups who put aside their differences back then. Göring's men have plenty of experience cracking down on starving Russian peasants, let us see how they fare when put up against men who have more than 1920's era rifles to bring to bare."
 FEN_SL_remobilize_the_english_air_force_desc:0 "The Battle of Britain was our finest moment for good reason, and we put up enough of a showing to delay invasion by almost two years. Yet that battle and the numerous restrictions imposed upon England by the Germans and their traitor allies left us with a number of planes, but a paucity of pilots.\n\nThis time when we fight Göring's Luftwaffe we will again need to take to the skies against that overwhelming horde, and we will need every pilot we have to win. We will mobilise the civilian pilots, American "volunteers", even what few of our old retired veterans still live. The knights of the sky shall slay the German beast, Goerinbg's men will choke on their own confidence."
 FEN_SL_cut_their_suppply_desc:0 "Battleships and carriers did not help us overmuch in the last war. Such expensive ships would be too few in number to make a difference at this point anyhow, even if half of them weren't at the bottom of the Atlantic or in former colonies across the seas. Instead let us turn the German's own tactics against them this once.\n\nSubmarines won't do much against the Kriegsmarine proper, but then those vessels aren't the ones we shall target. Troopships, supply vessels, anything that might enable the Germans to continue the fight in England without support. Our navy will sink them one and all, let the Fuhrer see his vaunted navy establish superiority in the surface waters. We will rule the deep and send his men there soon enough."
 FEN_SL_we_shall_fight_on_the_beaches_desc:0 "The Dover beachhead was the beginning of the end for us in the last war, and our strategy will have to reflect the reality that if we allow the Reich to gain a permanent foothold our end becomes a much more serious possibility. But is it even a war for England if she is not faced with utterly outrageous odds?\n\nWe are a nation bowed but unbroken. We threw the Germans off our isle once and we shall do it a thousand times over if that's what it takes. Failure is not an option, cowardice is not an option. Communist and capitalist, monarchist and republican, men and women all. We will fight together, we will die together, and the Germans will be driven back into the foul abyss from whence they came!"
 FEN_SL_we_shall_fight_in_the_fields_desc:0 "When they take the beaches we will meet them in the countryside. The roads will be mined, bunkers and fortifications established at key points. The Home Guard will have their orders, to hold as long as they can in time for proper forces to dispatch German offences. Every hillock, paddock and pen will be denuded of any resources the Reich might use to further their conquest. Every mine will be collapsed, every farm burned, every shelter denied to our enemy.\n\nFor this is a sacred war, a war of the righteous against the forces of darkness, of civilisation against depravity and a struggle in which we must emerge victorious not only for ourselves but for our families. Steady, men of England. We are not gone just yet."
 FEN_SL_and_in_the_streets_desc:0 "We have some experience in turning our homes into fortresses, Carlisle held for almost a week, and what parts of London were entered before the surrender cost the Reich thousands of men. Now we face the same challenge, but unlike the weak men of the first war we will never surrender meekly at the first sign of loss.\n\nBoard up the windows. Establish defensive networks along the canals and streets. Booby traps must be prepared and covert weapons stashes reestablished. Every house must be a deathtrap, every street a fight unyielding and every Englishman must be ready to do their duty. This will destroy our history, as buildings are turned to rubble and our monuments rent asunder. The past might die, but the present will live. England will prevail."
 FEN_SL_we_shall_never_surrender_desc:0 "Göring will show us no mercy. No more than Hitler did to the Russians and other peoples of Eastern Europe. Those not killed outright will be enslaved and made to create the homes for German colonists, our culture will be burnt to make room for that of the Reich, and in two hundred years the term England will be a geographical curiosity.\n\nThat is the fate which awaits us should we surrender, and it is why we will fight until the end this time. We will die together, our motley alliance of left and right. Every bullet must be spent, every German killed is just another victory. So long as even one man in England bares arms the Germans will never win. Winston Churchill was a man whose legacy was always uncertain, but he never surrendered. Neither shall we."
 FEN_SL_our_old_base_desc:0 "It is with great regret that our government has come to the conclusion that defending the entirety of England is simply not going to be a doable objective in this war with Göring's Reich. To this end, it falls upon the government to have a designated fall back area should the worst occur and significant German forces land in English territory.\n\nThe English North, stretching from Lancaster to Carlisle and Newcastle has always been the area of England most friendly to partisan forces, with HMMLR once basing itself primarily out of the region and its forming the core of our territory in the Civil War. Now that we face another, more dangerous war it might be that we can make use of the North once again. If we prepare defences, we can wait out the German tide."
 FEN_SL_repel_their_planes_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe has always been the primary focus of Hermann Göring, something we felt when it sought to level England to the ground over the course of WW2. Hence, any stratagem we employ must have some method of removing or at least relieving the pressure it will put on our forces.\n\nFortuitously, one thing we have in great supply is anti aircraft devices, both older style flak weapons for dealing with paratroopers and more modern american pieces for eliminating the threat of jet aircraft. Most of these will naturally be placed in the north where they can aid in our rebdout, and perhaps even ensure its survival. In the last war the Reich thought itself untouchable, let us see if that continues when we eliminate their airforce and kill all the pilots who bail out in time."
 FEN_SL_fighting_on_hills_desc:0 "England is not an especially hilly nation, with no great chains of mountains outside the Welsh border and few natural positions upon which a defence could be centred. Except that is, for the North. The North York Moors, the Pennines, the Lake District, all areas of rough terrain upon which we can base our defensive positions.\n\nThe Reich has little experience of fighting in the hills and valleys, their wars mostly being centred on the European plains and we might be capable of turning that to our advantage, should we take the effort to do so. Critically, we will have to ensure that there is an ample supply of weaponry and ammunition in case we lose the major factories, and perhaps leave some buried surprises for jerry as well?"
 FEN_SL_stall_them_in_the_north_desc:0 "The Manchester to Hull line, known more formally as the New Redoubt, is the plan by which if holding the south of our nation becomes untenable due to the number of German troops landed or sufficient casualties are inflicted in repelling them such that we lack adequate troops to defend the rest of the nation, we will withdraw all but a token force to defensive positions centred on and between the cities of Manchester and Hull.\n\nThe region is well fortified by both natural and artificial means, and the country is difficult for the Germans to use their armour superiority to full effectiveness. Any assault of the region should be capable of being repelled unless there is a great disparity in troop numbers. God save those outside our protection."
 FEN_SL_fight_for_our_liberty_desc:0 "The battle is nigh, the Reich assaults our island and now it is all or nothing. Gentlemen and ladies, it falls to use to win this war not just for ourselves but for the entirety of the free world. It falls to us to avenge the horrors inflicted in Russia, Africa and France. We will make our stand and we will show that obese tyrant in Germania why it is that the sun never set on the British Empire.\n\nCome one and all, we fight not merely for ourselves but with the strength of an entire world at our backs. There is no surrender to be offered or accepted. There is no deal we will take or bargain we shall make. For liberty we fight, for justice we fight. We fight for the murdered and the oppressed, and for those uncounted millions who births never were. England will not merely be the defeat of Germany, we shall be its tomb."
 FEN_SL_there_will_always_be_an_england_desc:0 "Sometimes through great effort and struggle even the impossible can be accomplished. What else can one call a single small island rent by war and ruin fighting and defeating the old tyrant of Europe? Putting aside politics and prejudice we united against the great evil of fascism and united we struck it down to the cold seas of the Channel.\n\nTheir bodies choke our bays and our beaches, their ruined ships cover the floors of our oceans. Their ruined planes rot in our fields. Hear this o tyrants far, for should you fight against Englishmen with nought but oppression at your back you too shall meet the just fate wrought onto Germany at our hand. For there will always be an England, and forever shall it be free."

 ENG_sealion.101.desc:0 "The second a large number of unidentified radar contacts appeared on the screens of England's air defense network, well-rehearsed plans went into immediate action. All flights in and out of the country were halted with immediate effect. Any plane headed to the country was turned around and redirected to Scotland, while all departures were canceled as well. There would be free skies for England's air force, and clear runways for the fighters to take off to meet the threat.\n\nAll oceangoing operations on the East side of the isle had been halted long ago. Ships were kept in harbor or close to the coast, and any new ship was ordered to approach from the west of the country. So when a number of vessels were sighted, the English navy knew these were not any errant civilians, but enemy warships. Thus, the vessels could storm ahead to challenge the intruders.\n\nAnd when the alarm went out, the same militias and guard units that had answered the call just a short time ago once again mobilized. They took their weapons, manned their same positions, and prepared to face the inevitable once again. This time, the enemy would come, he would land, and that was inevitable. But he would be challenged at every step, be it on the sand of the beach, on the fields of England, the paved streets of her towns and cities, or on the wooded undergrowth of her forests.\n\nEngland once again prepared to face an enormous threat. Everyone knew what failure would mean, they had experienced it. They had vowed never again, and now they were determined to ensure that reality. They had defied the odds once, and they would once again."

Lots of numbers and charts, most of which dealt with German economic activity. GDP growth, foreign currency reserves, interest rates, aircraft production, there were a lot of figures that he didn't understand, nor see the relevance of. That is, until he looked more closely. . .\n\n"I see," said Wingate. "Göring is headed for an economic crash. If he doesn't get access to some more hard currency reserves, and soon, he'll be unable to afford something like Sealion."\n\n"Correct," said Bonesteel, "and that's why the CIA says you will win by running out the clock if you hold out for three months."\n\n"You mentioned some more good news, General?"\n\nBonesteel said "the United States is giving you a blank check on this. Any equipment that you need, we will send over from our stockpiles. We are going to support you every step of the way, and the OFN is backing you up on this."\n\n"Splendid! When can we receive the first US divisions?"\n\nBonesteel's face went blank. Wingate's heart sank as he knew what it meant.

 ENG_sealion.103.desc:0 "The Duke of Wellington had once said Napoleon's Army was like a fine leather saddle: it was nice to look at, but when something went wrong, nothing could be done to repair it. The British Army, on the other hand, was like a saddle made of rope: not as nice to observe, but when something broke, you tied a rope and got on with the job. And in a modern Waterloo, where the English faced against another Napoleon, the comparison proved apt once again. The English had suffered many troubles and misfortunes, but they were always able to tie a knot. And when the Germans suffered the foretold setback, they found themselves completely out of luck.\n\nAt an instant, the authority from Germania ceased, and the attackers flew into a panic. With nobody in charge, the invaders either gave up the fight or were wiped out. The economic disaster that befell the Third Reich had taken the place of Blücher's Prussians, and their timely arrival ensured another English vanquishing of a threat to the world.\n\nThe cost had been tremendous. Cities and towns had been burned. Fields had been trampled over. Many young Englishmen had lost their lives in the struggle for English freedom. And the civilian death toll was tremendous. The effects of this war would be felt on the English economy for the longest time. And some of the deepest scars of the past three months would never heal.\n\nBut England had survived. Once again, the people of England had rallied to her defense. They had stood up to the greatest power on earth. And when they had been written off, they had stood up once more and emerged victorious. The path to world domination had been shut by her people once again, and the tyrant behind it had been doomed to an immediate and crushing failure."

The CIA, as you know, had some doubts about that, feeling the Germans would concentrate on their internal political situation and not take vengeful and cost-intensive actions for the purpose of prestige. Unfortunately, that assumption was based on the mistaken belief the Germans were rational people.\n\n"Our sources indicate airplanes and landing craft are already being assembled in Northern Germany. Fallschirmjäger units are preparing for operations, and regular Wehrmacht forces are undergoing naval training. They are going to launch an attack on this country, and it is only now a matter of when and where, not if."\n\nThe English cabinet processed this information.
