 RAO_rao_declaration:0 "Rao's Declaration"
 RAO_rao_declaration_desc:0 "India has failed its people. Falling into infighting among liberal and fascist people, one of the greatest nations on Earth has fallen far. To amend this, Comrade Rao has declared the Peasant Republic of Odisha: a state to liberate the suffering Odia people, and, eventually, all of India. Victory to Comrade Rao! Victory to the Odia! Long live the Peasant Republic of Odisha!"
 RAO_abolish_army:0 "Abolish The Army"
 RAO_abolish_army_desc:0 "As it stands, the army is a bourgeoise pre-socialist construct, maintained from British times. If we wish to achieve post-socialism in all matters, we must do it in the military, rather than simply economics and politics. Rather than use a military, Odisha shall use tactics of old, with the power of human force and ingenuity, rather than firearms or other pre-socialist and socialist equipment."
 RAO_no_more_officers:0 "No More Officers"
 RAO_no_more_officers_desc:0 "The difference between officers and volunteers in the military is a relic of the pre-socialist world. To end this blatantly bourgeoise example of class separation, we shall abolish the difference between the two posts. Unlike the failed Russian experiment, the Odia fighters shall be among the pillars of post-socialism. After all, the military is inherently political."
 RAO_no_more_generals:0 "No More Generals"
 RAO_no_more_generals_desc:0 "The general is the pinnacle of pre-socialism within the military. In fact, he is almost symbolic of a landowner himself; lording over all the volunteers (being themselves symbolic of the peasants) and getting all the credit for their work. To destroy this blatant act of bourgeoise thought within the military, we shall abolish the ranks of general and field marshal. Instead, the people shall lead themselves, unhindered by any pre-socialist commanders who lack half the skill that they do."
 RAO_triumph_of_the_will:0 "Triumph Of The Will"
 RAO_triumph_of_the_will_desc:0 "The soldier is finally free. With the abolition of pre-socialism in war, the people shall conduct a brutally efficient campaign against those who dare to enter and attempt to take the long-sought independence of the Odia away. In fact, it can be said that not knowing how to fight is the best way to fight; they come in expecting a professional army, and are instead met with guerilla soldiers who know that it is kill or be killed in Odisha."
 RAO_abolish_industry:0 "Abolish The Industry"
 RAO_abolish_industry_desc:0 "Comrade Rao first earned a name for himself among the bourgeoise CPI for his total anti-industrial beliefs. Rather than being pro-industrial, such as the Marxists, or simply against expansion of industry, such as many Telanganites, Comrade Rao has long stated that he is completely against industry. So, to achieve post-socialism, we shall do what Comrade Rao has been calling for for decades, and destroy all industry across Odisha!"
 RAO_make_your_own_weapon:0 "Make Your Own Weapons"
 RAO_make_your_own_weapons_desc:0 "Comrade Rao shall issue a decree to the people, simply declaring that, as we shall not import weapons from pre-socialist foreigners, and arms companies cannot exist in a post-socialist society, they shall make their own weapons. Everything one finds: a tree branch, leaves, or seeds, can be used against those pre-socialists who dare to enter our paradise. The Odia shall be ruthless, and make sure that nobody can ruin paradise."
 RAO_all_focus_on_the_fields:0 "All Focus On The Fields"
 RAO_all_focus_on_the_fields_desc:0 "In order to make sure that food is distributed perfectly equally, we shall make good use of former industrial workers: they shall be sent out to the fields to make sure we stay well-nourished. After all, they have already obtained the hard-working attitude that they will need to use in the fields, so they are already prepared to feed the Odia. Go forth with the till in hand, and feed the people!"
 RAO_abolish_famines:0 "The Abolition of Famine"
 RAO_abolish_famines_desc:0 "There is no longer famine in Odisha. The farmers go to work every day, unhindered by the difficulties of pre-socialist and socialist industry. They produce many crops, able to feed all Odia equally. On the industrial front, post-socialism has been achieved. In fact, there is the very possible view, held among many Odia, that the Peasant Republic of Odisha is one of the most well-fed countries in the world. Indeed, it can be said that there is no famine in Odisha."
 RAO_no_more_walls:0 "No More Artificial Walls"
 RAO_no_more_walls_desc:0 "Borders are, in all ways, a pre-socialist concept. Under the ancient world of post-socialism, we were free to travel between jungles, deserts, and plains as we liked. Fulfilling the post-socialism of our ancestors, Odisha shall have no more borders. Anyone may enter, but the Odia shall make sure that no pre-socialists are allowed to enter our paradise."
 RAO_abolish_thought:0 "Abolish The Economy"
 RAO_abolish_thought_desc:0 "The sirens of Delhi sing their songs to the Odia, attracting them away from post-socialism and towards regression into a pre-socialist society. We must prevent this at all costs, and advance forwards. To this end, a bright young Odia mind has proposed the abolition of the economy. There shall no longer be currency or any other pre-socialist creations, and we will return to the post-socialist bartering method of trade."
 RAO_kill_them_all:0 "Kill 'Em All"
 RAO_kill_them_all_desc:0 "The pre-socialists of Odisha have festered long enough, undermining the Odia and preventing true post-socialism from being achieved. To solve this matter, Comrade Rao, in his infinite wisdom, has proposed imprisonment and re-education of minor pre-socialists, and the summary executions of major ones, as well as those who refuse to learn. This will ensure the complete and total end of pre-socialism, and ensure that we shall never fall back to socialism or worse."
 RAO_no_mercy:0 "No Mercy"
 RAO_no_mercy_desc:0 "The re-education camps have, unfortunately, proven to not be enough for pre-socialists. In order to rectify this mistake, we must begin the permanent prosecution of pre-socialism by far more realistic methods. As such, we will permanently erase the upper class, and bring more peace and prosperity among the peasants of Odisha. We shall be a true representative of the Odia people, by any means necessary."
 RAO_only_rao_matters:0 "Victory to Comrade Rao"
 RAO_only_rao_matters_desc:0 "While Comrade Rao's re-education camps have been emptying, that is very good for us, as the pre-socialists were only the first step of our plan to prevent reaction from retaking Odisha. Comrade Rao's next wise proposal is the re-education and execution of socialists who wish to get in the way of post-socialism. This re-education will completely ensure that we shall never regress from perfection."
 RAO_no_more_suffering:0 "No More Suffering"
 RAO_no_more_suffering_desc:0 "The Odia have suffered enough. From the Mughal zealots, to the British exploiters, to two wars between the bourgeoise, they have been involved in many things that have nothing to do with them. However, Comrade Rao has no intention of continuing this practice. The Odia shall prosper as Odisha blossoms into the perfect nation, and they shall suffer no more pain and anguish from outside invaders."
 RAO_abolish_orissa:0 "Abolish Odisha"
 RAO_abolish_orissa_desc:0 "Odisha as it currently is is a mess of pre-socialist and socialist thought. If we are to achieve our goal in truly representing the peasants of India, we must destroy the old Odisha. The new, Marxist-Raoist Odisha shall be a bastion of post-socialist thought. We shall throw out the INC, CPI, and the independents, and start over on a new canvas - to be painted red with the blood from the People's Struggle."
 RAO_abolish_india:0 "Abolish India"
 RAO_abolish_india_desc:0 "There are few modern nations which have been as vile towards their peasants as the Republic of India and Free India. These two nations, themselves mere bourgeoise pre-socialists throwing the workers into meat grinders for fun, have done nothing for the peasants aside from token payments every once in a while. This shall not continue. The Odia shall never again be Indian, and post-socialism shall serve Odisha for a thousand years!"
 RAO_no_more_nations:0 "No More Nations"
 RAO_no_more_nations_desc:0 "The very concept of a nation is pre-socialist and bourgeoise. There is a select person or people in power who rules over the proletariat. To that end, we must take a new approach to governing Odisha. We shall not be a nation, but merely a people, instead. The Odia shall be able to live their own lives with little government interference, and there shall be a new, hands-off approach to governing. This will be a new day for the people of Odisha!"
 RAO_only_man_remains:0 "Only Man Remains"
 RAO_only_man_remains_desc:0 "With the complete destruction of pre-socialist thought, the Odia are now the only ones left in contol of Odisha. As the exploiters and pre-socialists fight outside our fair nation, we know that we alone have achieved prosperity. While India's sun has already set, the red rays of the Odia sun beat down, warming the people of our diverse land. At last, we have achieved true post-socialism."
 RAO_no_more_lies:0 "No More Lies"
 RAO_no_more_lies_desc:0 "We cannot maintain the idealistic pre-socialist attitude towards matters. We are not going to pretend that we are open to the people's eyes. We are not going to pretend that we are transparent. Odisha has its secrets that the Odia will not know, and we are willing to be honest about that. A true post-socialist society must sometimes lie and hide things for the good of its people. Perhaps one day the people will be able to know, but not today."
 RAO_abolish_ideology:0 "Abolish The Ideology"
 RAO_abolish_ideology_desc:0 "Socialism is not an ideology in the traditional sense, as pre-socialist ideologies are. In fact, the end goal of socialism is, paradoxically, the destruction of itself. So, if we are to achieve post-socialism, we must abolish the ideology, and live post-socialist lifestyles. This way, we will easily be able to achieve and exceed the goals of socialism, and create the purest place on Earth."
 RAO_there_can_be_only_one:0 "There Can Be Only One"
 RAO_there_can_be_only_one_desc:0 "Those traitors in Hyderabad are merely an extension of the bourgeoise;"
 RAO_human_nature:0 "All-Defining Human Nature"
 RAO_human_nature_desc:0 "Mankind does not need ideology or technology in a post-socialist world. While other socialist and pre-socialist nations rely on technology for almost everything and are advancing further towards being fully dependent on things which could go wrong at any moment, post-socialist Odisha shall not use such bourgeoise western appliances. As we advance further towards post-socialism, we must continue to strip the people of contrived electronics. When it is done, we shall rely on our human nature; the keystone of post-socialism."
 RAO_no_false_prophets:0 "Destroy The False Prophets"
 RAO_no_false_prophets_desc:0 "Marx was right when he said that religion was the opium of the masses. However, Marx neglected to state that it was the duty of us to prevent such addictions. In order to formulate the ideal society, Comrade Rao has determined that we cannot and will not allow religion to persist in Odisha. A policy of atheism shall be enacted and rigorously enforced, to prevent the opium of the masses from ruining more lives."
 RAO_no_more_traitors:0 "The Nest of Traitors"
 RAO_no_more_traitors_desc:0 "Despite the transition to post-socialism, there are still many Odia who believe in socialist, or, even worse, pre-socialist thought. To solve this issue, Comrade Rao has decided to begin a great campaign to crush resistance in Odisha. This campaign shall be the systematic gathering of those who registered with a party other than the CPI prior to the People's Struggle, along with any hidden traitors in the CPI, and re-educating them for a post-socialist ideology and lifestyle."
 RAO_beyond_orissa:0 "Beyond Odisha"
 RAO_beyond_orissa_desc:0 "The time has come to unsheath the blade, and take up arms against those who dare to oppose the people's will. Those traitors in the east, who sold themselves out to the imperialists in Tokyo and betrayed their brothers, and the reactionaries in the west who betrayed India's values and people for the world. Comrade Rao shall not give in to pressure though, and he shall reunite India under our scarlet banner. Onwards, against our foes!"
 RAO_nowalls:0 "How can a man be free when he's held by artificial walls?"
 RAO_nothought:0 "There is no purer thought than Rao's one!"
 RAO_killthemall:0 "Show them that we're not going to be merciful!"
 RAO_nonono:0 "If we show weakness on the slightest, they will devour us instantly."
 RAO_noborders:0 "There are no 'countries': only artificial walls set by traitors."
 RAO_abolishideology:0 "Why should we be coerced by false dichotomia?"
 RAO_nomorelies:0 "The Man has truly purified itself."
 RAO_noonebutrao:0 "Just Rao and only Rao!"
 RAO_nomoresuffering:0 "No one has to die now! Rejoice!"
 RAO_therecanbeonlyone:0 "Post-socialism isn't an ideology - it's a practice, it's a method, it's a way. And why should we tolerate anything but perfection?"
 RAO_outstanding_job:0 "To negate the effects of the famine we're experiencing, we must produce as much food as we can. All of our population has to learn how to grow crops effectively and protect it from the parasites. If necessary - by force."
 RAO_brilliant_job:0 "Starve no more.\n"
 RAO_warispeace:0 "They will not let us be in peace unless we will attack them first."
