 POLITICS_SEYNI_KOUNTCHE_DESC:0 "자르마인은 한 떄 단순히 프랑스인의 군홧발 아래에서 살아남은 사람들로 귀족들은 발전하고 거래하며 문제를 피하며 살아남기 위해 무슨 수라도 전부 썼습니다. 하지만 지금은 자르마를 자유로 인도할 의지와 방법을 갖춘 지도자가 있습니다. Seyni Kountché is that man, a man with history connected to the Zarma, who brings the people of Zarmaland the strength to face down those who are enemies to the Zarma, like Issa Korombé and his struggle against the Fulani.

The Sokoto were weak, and more importantly, many of their army were Zarma. A speech here and there,, and allies flocked to their side. Months after the bombing stopped, Kountché declared an independent Zarma state from Sokoto. But Kountché's control appears to be coming to an end. The people hate him and his deputies hate him even more. It seems that Kountché needs to make some difficult choices to remain in power..."
