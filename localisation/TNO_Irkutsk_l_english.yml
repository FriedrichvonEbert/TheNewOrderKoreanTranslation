 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_GENRIKH_YAGODA_DESC:0 "옛 소비에트 연방 시절로 거슬러 올라가면, 겐리흐 그리고리에비치 야고다는 굉장히 유명한 인물이자 동시에 공포의 대상이었습니다. NKVD 국장으로서, 야고다는 내부 권력 투쟁 초기부터 지지해왔으며 이후 권력을 장악한 부하린 정권의 안정과 안보를 공고히할 책임을 가지고 있었습니다. 그가 지극히 간단한 명령을 내리는 것 만으로도 가장 영향력 있는 볼셰비키마저 갑자기 실종되거나 반혁명적 행보를 이유로 처형될 수 있었습니다.\n\n그러나, 전쟁이 발발한 이후 연방의 영토 대부분과 모스크바마저 독일의 군홧발 아래에 짓밟히고 말았습니다. 이어지는 혼돈 속에서, 야고다는 주어진 권한을 최대한 활용해 최고 소비에트 상임 간부회 상당수를 독일국으로부터 가능한 한 멀리 떨어진 동부로 피난시켰습니다. 마침내 그는 시베리아 깊숙한 지역에서 지배권을 확립할 수 있었습니다. 그곳에서, 그는 가장 강력한 연방의 후계국을 통치하게 되었습니다.\n\n하지만 옛 상임 간부회가 설립한 국가는 오래 가지 못했습니다. 야고다의 제국이 천천히 무너지면서 하얼빈의 증오스러운 반동분자들부터 중앙 시베리아의 "민주주의자"와 함께하는 장군들, 바이칼호 바로 반대편의 반역적인 수정주의자들까지, 수많은 국가의 적과 반역자들이 계속해서 자신의 영지를 수립해 나갔습니다. 하지만 이르쿠츠크 정부가 여태까지 겪은 모든 타격에도 불구하고 여기는 여전히 또 하나의 군벌 국가로 우뚝 서 있습니다. 그리고 이르쿠츠크 정부가 가장 우월한 점은 바로 정통성에 있습니다. 어떤 군벌도 옛 정부의 직접적인 후계자라고 자칭할 수 없기 때문입니다. 야고다는 현재 NKVD가 수호하는 혁명의 마지막 요새에서만 통치권을 행사하고 있으며, 한 줌도 안되는 부하린주의 정치인들만 통치할 뿐입니다. 야고다에게 남은 것은 그뿐이지만, 이 정도로도 충분할 겁니다."
 
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BESSONOV_DESC:0 "A career Soviet politician, diplomat, and Communist Party official, as well as a staunch Bukharinist besides, Sergey Alexeyevich Bessonov followed along with the evacuation of government from Moscow during the German invasion. Remaining with the core of the Presidium, despite numerous defections and splinters, he settled with the others in Irkutsk, where his diplomatic experience earned him a position as Foreign Minister within General Secretary Yagoda's cabinet.\n\nHowever, Bessonov grew increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's approach to governance, and in particular strongly opposed his concentration of power towards the State faction and away from the Communist Party - the natural font of authority in any true Bukharinist state. As the power struggle between the Party and Yagoda's clique deepened, Bessonov knew where his loyalties lay, and when the time was right to depose Yagoda and once again empower the Party, he stood ready to play his part.\n\nNamed Premier by the grateful Presidium after Yagoda's fall, Bessonov moved quickly to eject Yagoda supporters and loyalists from positions of authority, replacing them with reliable Party officials. He intends fully to return the Presidium and the Union back to their Bukharinist roots, and in so doing, decisively - and permanently - dismantle the so-called 'Yagodaschina.'"

 IRK_mutiny_the_response_desc:0 "Comrades! Brothers and sisters! Workers and peasants of the Irkutsk Oblast! On behalf of the Soviet Presidium, we ask you to remain vigilant as the very existence of our Soviet Motherland is at stake. Taking advantage of our weakness against the forces of Rodzaevsky and Pasternak, deserters and traitors under the leadership of Valery Sablin are attempting to organize a revisionist insurgency, raising a dark and brutal mob to his ignoble cause and forcibly mobilizing them to commit unspeakable crimes against the working people.\n\nIn the time of the existential challenge to our beloved Union, we ask you to not succumb to provocations of the Sablinite counterrevolutionaries and direct all your efforts to fight the internal enemy. We warn you that the Soviet power will remain unshakable in its merciless attitude against treason. Any person engaged in the anti-Soviet activities or involved in encouraging or harboring the insurgents will be held accountable and be subjected to the most severe punishment."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_trenches_desc:0 "The Soldiers of the Union have endured the unimaginable, and we must now ask them to endure more. They are our shield against the traitors and partisans who seek to finish what the Germans started all those years ago. If the Union is to survive, we have to do everything we can to support the men fighting on the front line for our cause.\n\nBy ensuring deliveries of food, equipment, and weapons reliably make it on time to the soldiers who need them we can make the hellish conditions of Siberian warfare slightly more bearable. We can cycle between frontline and reserve duty, allowing them to recover and fight more effectively when it is time to return to the battlefield. We cannot let our morale falter in the face of yet another threat."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_defense_desc:0 "The partisan's rebellion must be quickly crushed without mercy or hesitation. To this effect, Yagoda has ordered the Ministry of Defense to immediately shift the nation to a war footing until the eastern rebellion has been fully stamped out. Certain areas of the economy will shift production to military materials, while others will continue to operate, but in a modified fashion. Military rations will be temporarily prioritized over the civilian food supply, while several factories currently producing civilian goods will begin being converted to weapon foundries.\n\nAnother step the Ministry of Defense has been ordered to take is the issuing of the "museum pieces". These antiquated weapons date back to before the second world war and have until now been kept in storage. The Ministry will issue these weapons to our reserve units focused on hunting partisans operating in our own territory."
 IRK_mutiny_volunteers_for_the_union_desc:0 "Volunteers For The Union"
 IRK_mutiny_nkvd_guards_detachments_desc:0 "In the Union's darkest hour, it was the NKVD that rescued the Presidium and evacuated it to Irkutsk. Now, when we are forced to fight for our survival once more, the NKVD shall deliver us victory again. Some of the most experienced soldiers in our nation are members of the NKVD guards. Currently, these men are scattered in small groups across the country, serving as bodyguards, intelligence officers, and secret police, but they could be of greater use if we organized them into a full military division.\n\nThis new NKVD motor rifle division will be the tip of the spear that we will skewer the traitors with. The ragtag bandits won't stand a chance against the discipline and ruthlessness of the finest soldiers of the Soviet Union. Once we have defeated the partisans this new division will be instrumental to our reclamation of Siberia, and eventually all of Russia."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_construction_desc:0 "Irkutsk is the main economic and industrial hub of eastern Siberia, but we have been hurt by the rebellion. Large portions of our military industry and infrastructure have fallen under the control of Sablin's bandits at a moment when we need them most. To make up for this, the Directorate of Construction will have to make some accommodations for our military.\n\nFactory space that would have otherwise gone to other projects has been cleared for military production. Infrastructure projects that will benefit the military have been accelerated while civilian constructions have been postponed indefinitely. Until we have recovered our stolen industry, we must get everything we have out of what remains. We have to keep our army supplied and on the move, no matter the cost."
 IRK_mutiny_field_fortification_planning_desc:0 "Field Fortification Planning"
 IRK_mutiny_supplemental_labor_battalions_desc:0 "We need all hands on deck to defeat the Sablinites, even those who might have failed us before. The gulags of our nation are filled with physically capable prisoners eager to prove their redemption and earn their freedom, or at the very least a reduced sentence. We will create a program of labor battalions formed from volunteers from the gulags, who will supplement our military engineers and aid field constructions for the duration of the rebellion.\n\nOf course, we must be careful with these volunteers. Many of them have attempted to betray us before, and exposure to any rebel propaganda could easily incite them to do so again. To incentivize loyalty, any volunteers who complete their work without incident will be rewarded with a modest reduction of their sentence. The last thing we want is a mass prisoner revolt behind our lines."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_capital_desc:0 "Sablin's rebellion has exposed the key weaknesses within our central government. It is a travesty that the traitors managed to advance their cause to this point without the institutions of the state managing to stamp them out. Immediate steps must be taken to make sure that the holes in the government that led to the present situation are plugged.\n\nOnce the partisans have been crushed the government must be ready to quickly reintegrate the territory they stole from us and crack down on any remaining dissent that may emerge. We must also begin a review of our government to see how this rebellion escaped our notice. This will not be allowed to happen again, not if the Union is to have any hope of surviving."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_presidium_desc:0 "The necessary reforms to our apparatus of the state will be handled by the Presidium of the Soviet Union. In these troubled times the Presidium can serve as a beacon of stability to guide us through the storm. While the military and the NKVD handle the matter of crushing the rebellion, the politicians of the Presidium will work to make sure that normalcy is maintained as much as is possible in a time of war.\n\nInvestigations into the Presidium itself must also take place, both internal and external. If any traitors remain hidden within our government we must sniff them out. More important than that though, is the lack of oversight within the Presidium that allowed the rebellion's leaders to continue their plot. In the new Presidium such things will not be possible."
 IRK_mutiny_an_ironclad_union_desc:0 "This is no time for dissenting voices or questioning authority. The Union is facing a crisis that threatens to destroy it, a crisis which was born out of disunity. Some within our government see the rebellion as a chance to advance their own agendas or push for their pet reforms while our attention is elsewhere. If this backroom maneuvering is allowed to go on unchecked it could spell our demise.\n\nYagoda has ordered that all factionalism within the Presidium and the government as a whole must end immediately. For the duration of the crisis only authorized motions pertaining to it may be discussed and implemented. Anyone who attempts to subvert this order will find just how serious we are. There may eventually be a day when we can afford the luxury of allowing constructive criticism from within our ranks. That day is not today."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_shadows_desc:0 "The greatest weapon left in our arsenal is our intelligence apparatus. When Russia fractured it was the agents of the NKVD who kept the Union alive and carved out a new home for the revolution in Irkutsk. The operatives and spies of the NKVD are some of the most experienced in the world. The time has come to use them against Sablin and his gang of traitors, and tear apart the upstart rebellion from within.\n\nThe fragile new government across Lake Baikal is a perfect target for infiltration and sabotage. It is run by inexperienced amateurs trying to figure out how to run a nation as they go. Our agents will have no trouble infiltrating it by posing as traitors or double agents, and in many cases, they won't even need to hide their identities. Before long the partisans will be in disarray, with all their plans and secrets laid bare before us."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_state_security_desc:0 "When one is waging a war of subterfuge and espionage, defense is even more critical than offense. As we uncover the secrets of the rebellion, we must take precautions to make sure they do not uncover ours as well. The NKVD's internal service apparatus, the Directorate of State Security is responsible for this vital mission. Partisan operations are notoriously hard to stamp out, but if there is anyone who can do it, it is them.\n\nMembers of the government who display anything less than total loyalty will be placed under surveillance, as will anyone who was associated with known traitors before they began their revolt. Agents will be posted in every town and city, keeping their ears to the ground for any sign of trouble. Patrols will sweep the countryside to intercept infiltrators. Irkutsk shall become an intelligence black hole."
 IRK_mutiny_mobile_interrogation_centers_desc:0 "Sometimes time is of the essence and prisoners with valuable information cannot be transported back to secure locations quickly enough. Extracting information is already a time-consuming process without the added delay of bringing a captured asset to an interrogation room and then having to take the information they divulge back to the front lines. The solution to this problem is simple: bring the interrogation room to the front lines.\n\nBy refitting a number of trucks to carry intelligence officers who specialize in information extraction and "wetwork", as well as the tools they use to carry out their jobs, we can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of our interrogations of sablinite prisoners. As an added bonus, the trucks may acquire such a reputation that the unpleasant methods of our interrogators may be rendered unnecessary. The fear of the trucks alone will break even the most hardened partisan."
 IRK_mutiny_trials_fitting_for_traitors_desc:0 "Trials Fitting For Traitors"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_propaganda_desc:0 "In times of war propaganda can make the difference between victory and defeat. It is essential that friendly morale be kept high and enemy morale be kept low. The current rebellion is no exception and the Ministry of Propaganda has been hard at work making sure everyone knows that our victory is inevitable. They have recently completed the preparations for a two-pronged propaganda offensive for soldiers on both sides of the front line.\n\nWe will inspire our own loyal soldiers with tales of bravery performed by their comrades, and by reminding them of the long legacy of resistance and heroism they are continuing. We will bombard the traitorous bandits with propaganda proving the superiority of our troops and exposing the misguided fools they have followed into battle against their own countrymen."
 IRK_mutiny_remember_the_revolution_desc:0 "Sablin has attempted to claim the mantle of Lenin's revolution, painting himself as a true Leninist and his band of scum as spiritual successors to the October Revolution. While this is obviously nonsense, many of our citizens have fallen under the sway of these lies. We must prove that we carry the torch of the worker's revolution, while the partisans are nothing more than deceitful reactionaries.\n\nThe Ministry of Propaganda will launch a campaign based on Sablin's messages - remembering the October Revolution, staying true to Lenin's goals, and so forth, but we will do it better. Sablin is stuck with a group of ideologues and intellectuals quoting theory at each other, while we have teams of professional propagandists working with a proper budget to spread our messages far and wide."
 IRK_mutiny_for_it_forever_lives_on_desc:0 "For It Forever Lives On"
 IRK_mutiny_the_union_forever_desc:0 "Victory is at hand. After months of fighting we have finally driven back the traitors and are preparing to deliver the killing blow. These cowards sought to destroy the Union when it was at its weakest, but they failed to learn the lessons of history. If the Germans with the mightiest army to ever march across Europe could not destroy us, no one can. They knew their only chance was to strike while our back was turned and even then they failed.\n\nOnce our victory has been secured it will be time to begin rebuilding our fractured territory. This hopeless rebellion never had a chance of toppling the Soviet Union, but it will change it. Certainly we cannot revert to the old status quo that allowed this to happen in the first place. We will never be able to reclaim Russia if we are constantly occupied fighting rebellions and partisans. No matter what happens, we will go forward knowing our victory is assured. The Union shall not, must not fall."

 IRK_postwar_the_union_victorious_desc:0 "The people of the Soviet Union have done it, comrades! The rebellious Sablinites have been utterly smashed and we have emerged victorious from the battle in full glory! We have proven our strength once more and showing our neighbors that we will not go down without a fight.\n\nHowever, just because the battle has been finished, does not mean that this is time for celebration! It is time for us to regroup and bring justice to the Sablinites!\n\nIt is time for the Soviet Union to cut the final piece of thread that our opposition dangles off of, and to show the Sablinites that we, the people of the Union, still remain vigilant and powerful, even in our most dire state!"
 IRK_postwar_the_great_purge_desc:0 "The Soviet Union cannot allow a counterrevolutionary revolt on this scale to ever occur again. If Russia is to ever rise from the ashes and show the Union as a stable entity, then our regional administrations must not allow these rebels to ever rise up against our government. We need to strike the source of the problem: The Incompetent and Corrupt.\n\nIt is time for a Purge, we must round up all those that are too incompetent to lead an administration, gather them all up! Fire them! Imprison them! Expel them from the party!\n\nAnd for the especially corrupt, bring them to the back of the shed and shoot them like the sick dogs they are! We cannot have a stable Union if the people are being represented so incompetently..."
 IRK_postwar_assemble_the_commission_desc:0 "It is crucial that we have an effective Purge to remove the filth, and in doing so, we will need an effective Commission that can do the work of collecting the information of these incompetent and corrupt officials, then disposing of them through however means absolutely all means necessary.\n\nWe must bring the people within the NKVD that are talented at handling and sorting through the evidence we find about the corrupt administrators and plotting how to deal with them, depending on just how severe they might destroy this Union from the inside out.\n\nAfter all, it would be impossible to commit to our Purge without an actual Commission to handle the dirty work for the people of the Soviet Union, we cannot risk another rebellion!"
 IRK_postwar_recall_suspect_personnel_desc:0 "We have a lot of suspects noted by the NKVD for potential punishment, whether their track record are a lot more minor cases of simply sheer incompetence, or more extreme cases of corruption, we will need to remove them from their positions for the necessary steps of the Purge.\n\nHowever, while the people we are purging might have been incompetent at their job or might have had traces of corruption, we cannot just remove them from their positions and leave an empty void. Those positions will need to be filled.\n\nWe will instate some... "temporary" personnel to fill their shoes in their jobs, we cannot leave such a power gap or else we could be destabilizing the Union further."
 IRK_postwar_the_investigations_desc:0 "While nobody can remain out of the NKVD's grasp for long, it has become clear that some of the suspects we are closing in on are simply entrenched too deep into the political machine to be removed easily. Now that the commission has been assembled, we shall begin a wide series of investigations to gather evidence on those corrupt officials who foolishly assume they are untouchable. With luck, we will find something concrete and can continue to make arrests.\n\nOnce we have enough material on to start the crackdowns in earnest, however, the question remains as to how to properly deal with the arrested officials. With the evidence in hand, the commission will move to determine the severity of the suspect's crimes, and therefore the severity of their punishment.\n\nWhile most of these parasites will no doubt be found to be enemies of the state and will be purged for their idiotic crimes against the people, there may be some who are not too far gone and can be encouraged to realize the error of their ways. Once the evidence has been gathered and reviewed, the final decision on whether or not to show clemency with minor offenders will ultimately rest on Comrade Yagoda and the NKVD."
 IRK_postwar_zero_tolerance_desc:0 "These incompetent and corrupt officials can not be allowed to continue holding their governmental positions in any capacity! Any person who is caught and prosecuted within the Great Purge will not be reinstated in any capacity in our government, no matter how little their job!\n\nWe are to show absolutely no mercy to these people, when the Great Purge is over and should they be spared, they must be forbidden from re-entering the political scene in the Soviet Union ever again! The damage they caused while they were in power was already bad enough, if we let them back on, imagine how much more damage they could do to the people!\n\nThe Soviet Union cannot risk these disgusting incompetents crawling their way back onto the administration, or else they could destroy the Union!"
 IRK_postwar_opportunities_for_forgiveness_desc:0 "There are a certain group of people within our reach that we could potentially use to our advantage in order to further re-establish our glorious republic. Their role in the prior administration was highly effective, but all that effectiveness ended up coming at a price - corruption.\n\nThe opportunity for us is there to seize; the major potential to gain us the return of those who had powerful projection of their skills in our government.\n\nIf we are to utilise these people to our advantage, we could promise them redemption. They could regain their original positions and we can cover their tracks, however, only under the stern condition that they do not repeat their... silly mistakes once more."
 IRK_postwar_the_irkutsk_trials_desc:0 "The time has come. Our investigations have been completed, our judicial approach has been decided upon, and we must now act to complete our purge of the state's enemies.\n\nWe will bring those identified as guilty, through whatever means, to trial. We will show the people, directly, that these counterrevolutionary elements, corrupt officials, traitors, parasites, and others, cannot escape judgement.\n\nAnd once they are finally gone, the state and Party will at last be secure. We will make sure of it."
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_the_mutiny_desc:0 "While their ideology of the Buryat Mutiny, the disgraceful Sablinite rebellion against the Soviet Union, was in the wrong place, and they were promptly crushed by the real Revolution they sought to revolt against, perhaps we should take some notes of their tactical ability against us.\n\nThe ability for the rebels to arm so many supporters is a curious one, and one we should be opening commissions into. We need to analyse how they were able to achieve what they had managed to, and see how we can adopt that to the Soviet Union's army!\n\nWhile the Sablinites might not have been good at using their tactics effectively, the Soviet Union will happily rebrand it as ours and use it more efficiently!"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_their_spirit_desc:0 "What was the driving force behind their rebellion, comrades? It was their hope and desires to remove our administration for their own potential regime, which had ended up creating quite the inspirational source for them to gain the ideas of toppling the Union.\n\nWe must take some notes from what gave the rebellious Sablinites the hope to take over, and note what we could gain from learning how they had formed their desire to replace the Soviet Union with their flawed system.\n\nIf we can ignite that same light of patriotism, not for Sablin, but rather for the people of Russia within the Union, then we have much to gain from this, comrades."
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_sablin_desc:0 "While Sablin did their absolutely disgraceful betrayal of what the Soviet Union has stood for, it could be in our key interest to investigate Sablinite policies and check for the outliers that could help control our land further.\n\nIt could be necessary that we implement some minor reforms that have come from Sablin's system, to not only increase our popularity from his former supporters, but to potentially have our very own benefits to taking these ideas for ourselves.\n\nThere might not be anything wrong taking ideas from a betrayal if those ideas are indeed beneficial for our own gain...isn't there?"

But we won't give up so easily with such a set back. In order to accomplish our goals, our government's legitimacy must be restored, back to when we were truly recognized as the leaders of Russia!\n\nNo matter the means that we are to take our approach for the reclamation of the Union, we must regain our spot among the great powers once more and return the people of Russia to their rightful place on the world stage!"
 IRK_postwar_a_union_of_letters_desc:0 "Since the fall of our Union decades ago, opportunists, counter-revolutionaries, and fools alike have fought an unceasing war to destroy our legitimacy.The Sablinite rebellion was the last in a long line of betrayals and traitorous acts, each designed to lead the masses astray towards their own inevitable destruction.\n\nAfter so many brushes with annihilation, many in the presidium believe it is high time to turn inward. While we have always acted with their best interests at heart, It is clear that much of our population has lost faith in their government's ability to uphold the ideals of the revolution and provide for them.\n\nIn light of this, and in an attempt to expedite reintegration of the Buryat ASSR, we will begin a new campaign, one of "1000 letters".\n\nNamed after the 17th century "republic of letters", we will attempt to foster a similar culture of innovation. Open criticism in all levels of government will be encouraged, so long as it is constructive. Workers and Bureaucrats alike will be asked to mail in their thoughts and concerns regarding our reunification struggle.\n\nHopefully such actions will lead to an efficient administration, attraction of distant intellectuals, and a renewed sense of connection between the masses and their vanguard party."
 IRK_postwar_necessary_reforms_desc:0 "The 1000 Letters campaign has proven to be exceptionally fruitful! Peasants and bureaucrats alike have risen to the occasion, making use of this unique opportunity for critical expression directed to the presidium itself. We have received well over 1000 letters, each detailing workplace grievances and various administrative inefficiencies.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most encouraging result of our effort has been the expansion of legitimacy among the formerly rebellious Buryat ASSR. While it is true that the eastern shores of Lake Baikal were relatively timid in composing letters, those that we have collected have proven highly valuable. In addition, the lack of a crackdown upon those that spoke freely seems to have eased tensions. Acts of sabotage are steadily declining, and it appears we just might be able to deprogram those taken hostage by opportunism yet.\n\nNow comes the time of transformation. From words we have devised actions; Increases in low level pay,a tempered five year grain quota, and the closing of managerial loopholes. These programs, as well as other collected reforms, will soon be implemented to compound upon the trust we have built. Let us make haste."

In order to achieve this goal, only the most educated and politically advanced people can run the higher functions of the state, not the average worker. To directly involve the people could risk needless inefficiency at a critical time, especially as we reorganize the Union.

An open showing of security will force the criminals to retreat underground, and allow us to reassert our authority. Furthermore, we shall step up the duties of the NKVD from a law enforcement perspective, allowing them to assert their authority and beat back the lawlessness that has plagued our outer lands for too long!"

Speeches shall be conducted and propaganda to this end will be spread across our lands, but we must ensure that these are not empty words by actually supporting the people. It may be costly, but it will help us gain a sense of legitimacy, something that we need now more than ever."

We need to show the people, through propaganda, speeches, and initiatives, that the USSR merely seeks to build socialism from within, nurturing it ino order to protect the people. Furthermore, we must ensure the people understand that the Presidium, and Yagoda, do not exist just to be a distant ruler, but to ensure your safety and security in a time when that is all too rare. By increasing the rate of patrols throughout the cities, and having an increased presence of security in the countryside, we can hopefully express that yes, we will keep the people safe!"

This new sense of legitimacy means that we can embark on further efforts without having to worry about discontent from the people. The USSR may have been brought low, but we will restore its glory!"

Once the east is secured with our righteous fervor and might, we shall move deeper and deeper into our lost heartland, and drive the traitors who abandoned the Union back, either into retreat or into the ground. With the spirited guidance of the legitimate leader of the Union, Comrade Yagoda, our failure in the brutal conflicts to come is a near impossibility.

These are people who idealize the very system that brought our proud Union to its knees. This indignity cannot be allowed to stand. Through iron and fire we will show them that we are strong, that we have always been strong. From here to Kamchatka, our beloved socialist ideals will cause the hearts of the proletariat so wrongfully suppressed by the Fascists or the false Tsar to soar for the first time in years. To this end, the soldiers of the Union must be turned to men of iron. Their weapons must become the instruments of our revolutionary fire."

The partisans seem to value their survival, and with the Sablinists taken care of, we are far better equipped to provide them with security in these dark times than any other power in Russia. That sentiment including themselves. An envoy should be sent with a message suggesting that the partisans acknowledge our claim over their lands and their citizens in return for friendship and a part in restoring the glory of the Union.

Our priority now that Aldan has been turned into an ally of the Union should be to transform the area into a veritable fortress against the northern wolves who might make victims of our citizenry. With enough men, guns, and concrete we can make sure that an assault from our north would be a fool's errand. Hopefully, with enough time and resistance to their excursions into our newly reclaimed territory, we may prove that they are fruitless efforts and stop them altogether."

Now we must take steps to liberate their citizens from under their small-minded boots. We must give the weak the protection that these Aldan partisans are unable to. Even if the citizens themselves do not believe in the necessity of these steps, we will show them the necessity with our own force of arms. After this, the citizens will be sure to support us as their hearts cry out to live under the banner of socialism once more whether they realize it or not. Comrade Yagoda has given the order, and thus we march to a song of reclamation and liberation."

The trials are a show, but a necessary one. Their cases are a coming storm that will shake the resolve of the less committed among us, but the strength and righteousness of our cause will be maintained through the silencing of their voices. No one may be allowed to subvert the truth of our cause with their rebellion, and an example must be made of those who would. A cacophony of gunshots ring through Irkutsk tonight.

He reduced the Union to nothing more than an NKVD client state that paid lip service to the revolution and nothing else.\n\nIt is far past time we returned to the original course Lenin set for us. There must be a true dictatorship of the proletariat, not simply a bourgeois dictatorship dressed in red. The liberation of the working class must always be at the forefront of our minds.

Fortunately, this crude transport hub can be repurposed into a proper trading port and shipbuilding facility.\n\nWhile the ports of Magadan and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky could fulfill the task already, they are poorly connected with the regional center. Additionally, sub-optimal climate may render them unusable over the cold period of the year. Thus, Chumikan has been designated as the 'most economically viable port', and is to be developed accordingly, so that our Union can establish a naval presence in the Okhotsk sea, challenging the crumbling Japanese hegemony."

Fortunately, the Union's economists have found a compromise solution. It calls for a complex system that ensures import contracts are scaled in accordance with the fulfillment of the economic plan.

Thus it has been found necessary to start constructing a new branch of the TransSib, going North, along the Pacific coast.

It has thus been found detrimental, that in the spirit of proletarian egalitarianism, potential intellectuals of all sexes, nationalities, and backgrounds should be provided the necessary education and resources to conduct research for the benefit of the Union.

This alliance of socialist and communist parties from around the globe will promote the revolutionary cause and fight against fascist and capitalist tyranny wherever they are found.

"이건 레닌 훈장이란다." 아버지는 소년이 입을 열기도 전에 대답했습니다.\n\n"레닌은 어떤 사람인가요?" 아이는 천진난만하게 물었습니다. 고위 관료를 상임간부회로 호송할 준비를 하던 NKVD 경호원은 소년을 바라보며 미소를 짓지 않을 수 없었습니다. \n\n"위대한 사람이지. 아마 그가 아직도 살아있었다면, 우린 애초부터 이런 엉망진창인 상태에 빠지지 조차 않았을 거야. 전쟁, 죽음, 대중의 억압까지, 모든 것을 피할 수 있었겠지. 아들아, 반드시 기억해다오. 그의 유산을 짊어지는것은 오직 우리에게 달려있단다. 모스크바의 진정한 정부는 네가 태어나기도 전에 모스크바의 침략자에게 넘어갔지만, 우리의 상임간부회는 야고다 동지와 그의 친구들의 도움을 받아 구해져 이르쿠츠크로 피신하는데 성공했지."\n\n"그럼 왜 이런 끔찍한 일들이 일어나는거죠? 왜 우리는 그저 평범한 삶을 누릴 수 없는거에요?"\n\n"우리가 어쩌다가 여기까지 오게 되었는지는 간단한 이야기가 아니지만, 너는 이걸 반드시 배워야 하겠지. 먼저, 독일군이 쳐들어왔지. 전차와 폭탄을 들고, 모국을 침략하여 수백만명을 노예로 전락시키고 부하린의 통치를 끝냈단다. 그 후, 브루주아들과 "지식인"들과 우리가 지독한 궁핍에 빠져있을 때 싸워댄 부자들이 나타났고, 시베리아 전쟁을 통해 우리가 모국을 되찾을 기회를 끝내버렸지. 그 다음은 일본의 개들인 반동분자들이 서쪽에서 나타났지. 그리고 마지막 타격은 바로 수정주의자들, 즉 사블린파 폭도들이 일으킨 호수를 가로지른 반란이지. 우리는 연방의 뜻을 이어가는 최후의 사람들이란다."\n\n"그럼, 이 네 가지가 모든 것을 일으킨건가요?""

Simply a soft whoosh, and then silence.As the others slowly uncoiled themselves from fetal positions and emerged from the various shacks they had cowered in, they stared at their commanding officer, who was now hysterical.\n\n"Pamphlets!" he shouted through bouts of absurd laughter. "The bastards have sent us reading material!"\n\nThe quiet tension broke as the people milled about the courtyard again. Some cried, having felt yet another brush with the end.

Ever since his defection from the NKVD, he had been trying his best to lend his talents to the mutineers and show them how a war is supposed to be fought. Perhaps it wouldn't have been such a challenge if they weren't young enough to be Popov's children. Getting these youngsters to work with any kind of cohesion has proved to be more difficult than the colonel had ever expected.\n\n"What are we waiting for? The tyrant's goons lie in wait just beyond that ridge! I say to hell with all of this, we should head over there and kick some ass!" A spirited young officer said, trying to win over the cramped room with his bluster. Popov found himself getting ready to respond, but a muffled noise from outside distracted him from the moment. Glancing at the window, all he could see was the furious Siberian winter continuing its assault on the glass panes. Perhaps it was just the wind? "And what is your plan once we get over there," one of the other officers asked, "charge into their lines and die like idiots?" Popov heard it again, and this time it was closer. The howling wind made it difficult to determine what it was. "Well, we have to do something! I've been freezing my-" The brash young officer was cut off by the sound of the door being violently kicked open.\n\nPopov felt his heart leap out of his chest as he turned his attention to the door. Four imposing figures wearing white camouflage coats and brandishing assault rifles began loudly demanding everyone in the room to surrender their arms. His heart sank as he recognized the badges on their hats. The NKVD had come for him. "I'll never surrender, you bastards!" the young officer boldly shouted at the assailants as he drew his sidearm. He scarcely had the chance to aim before the soldiers unleashed a vicious storm of lead, gunning down every man in the room besides Popov. Ears ringing and vision blurred by the blood of his comrades, the disoriented colonel felt his knees give in.

From bickering politicians who refused to act in the face of fascist bandit armies, to the near collapse against the counter-revolutionary republicans in the 50s- much has been lost. Millions of lives have been sacrificed unwillingly by those who would dare to neglect the lessons of the October Revolution.\n\nThe Buryat 'Sablinites' are next in the long line of this ideological rot. It is a rot that has clearly spread beyond control, as Valery Sablin himself was once a promising NKVD commissar. After being foolishly entrusted to organize labor in the construction of hydroelectric power near lake Baikal, he seized a radio tower to spew his utopian, convenient revisionism.\n\nYagoda and the loyal remnants of the Presidium bear a gargantuan weight upon their shoulders. Years of defeat have left the Union crippled, and its people susceptible to opportunists and liars. It is all too possible that this burgeoning rebel army could spiral out of control, and spell doom for the last remnant of order and legitimacy in this Russian chaos. The scared peasants who tremble beneath Sablin's lies must be convinced to return to their senses, and the conniving men who lead them must be brought to swift justice."

On this occasion, however, the task was not as soul-grinding as usual, for each report painted small fragments of a much larger, optimistic picture: all of Yagoda's plans and hard work were finally coming together. One report stated clearly that any lingering Sablinite influence in Irkutsk had seemingly dissipated for good. It seems that all of the investigations and purges had borne fruit after all. Even now Yagoda couldn't help but feel remnants of anger and betrayal when he thought about the foolish exploits of the mutineers, and how their brazen defiance of the Union caused him so much trouble. At least now he could take comfort in the fact that they would never trouble him again.\n\nAfter some time, he had finally come to the real meat of that evening's reading: the Red Army's reports on combat readiness. What he saw was all the more promising. Not only did High Command report that the military was close to recovering all manpower lost during the mutiny, but also that the subsequent organizational reforms were going through without issue. Intermixed were various updates on the NKVD's espionage efforts into neighboring warlord states, and they had all come back with roughly the same conclusion: the Fascists' forces were hopelessly unable to match the Red Army in pitched battle. Once the proper plans of attack had been drawn up, Yagoda anticipated that the coming wars would be a mere triviality assuming the NKVD's reports were accurate.\n\nLighting a cigarette, Yagoda leaned back in his chair and began to think about the future. It was obvious that the war for the interior was coming to a close. From this point onward, his efforts would almost solely be focused on reclaiming whatever was wrestled away from the Soviet Union in its darkest hours. The uphill struggle to take back what was lost would soon begin, and the world would never be the same."

 IRK.8.t:0 "The Great Purge"
 IRK.8.desc:0 ""Comrade Yagoda, you wished to speak with me?" Pavel Bulanov asked as he stepped into Yagoda's office. The door was pulled shut behind him, and the room was now silent, save for the clock on Yagoda's desk. "Have a seat, Comrade Bulanov." Genrikh Yagoda always had a humorless look about him, but there was something especially troubling about his demeanor this time. "Comrade Bulanov, I'm sure you are aware by now that I am rather displeased with the state of my administration?" Bulanov could only guess where this was headed."Yes, comrade, I have heard rumors."\n\n"Allow me to reveal to you how I really feel then. I'm absolutely livid, Bulanov. Ever since we defeated Sablin's merry band of traitors, it has become painfully clear that I am surrounded by corrupt buffoons who couldn't run an office to save their lives." Although Yagoda did not raise his voice, his eyes betrayed a great anger. "I see, have you tried scheduling a meeting? Perhaps you could speak sense into them, comrade." Yagoda frowned. "And continue to bash my head against a wall? Come now, Bulanov. I wouldn't have asked for my security chief if I intended to reason with these people." Yagoda then pushed a folder across his desk towards Bulanov. "This is a dossier of 'troublemakers' I have been gathering for some time. I want the NKVD to start a full investigation as soon as possible." Bulanov noticed a smaller piece of paper attached to the folder. Upon closer inspection, it was a list of names and instructions. "And what is this for, Comrade Yagoda?"\n\n"Those are people that I want behind bars or in front of a firing squad by tomorrow morning. I don't want my intentions to be misinterpreted by anyone, Comrade Bulanov. Our great Union is in for the wake-up call of a lifetime." Later that night, Pavel Bulanov arrived alone at the NKVD headquarters in Irkutsk. Only minutes later, a large column of trucks filled to the brim with NKVD officers left the compound under cover of darkness and rolled into the city to inflict terror upon the enemies of the people. The Great Purge had begun."

 IRK.9.t:0 "Into The Files"
 IRK.9.desc:0 "For the past two weeks, the special NKVD commission had been meeting in their headquarters in Irkutsk every day to lay the groundwork for investigating the more high-profile targets of Yagoda's purges. Files were examined, evidence was reviewed, and men's very fates were to be decided upon. Those who were in the commission were a veritable who's-who of the NKVD's highest echelons. Among them was Security Chief Pavel Bulanov, and, on this occasion, General Secretary Yagoda himself.\n\n"Now, comrades, that we are in the process of gathering enough evidence to arrest every man who has attained a Soviet political office in the past 10 years, there is still one question that we have yet to broach, and I figure now would be as good a time as any." Almost every man in the room looked to Bulanov in anticipation. "Once these men are in custody, how do you all propose they are dealt with?" Much to Bulanov's dismay, the room almost immediately fell into a deafening silence.\n\nAfter a deceptively long quiet intermixed with nervous glances and coughs, it was finally broken by a visibly irritated Yagoda. "You mean to tell me that you idiots have been meeting in this place for almost two goddamn weeks now and still haven't figured this out? What a joke." After further silence, only one officer had the courage to speak up. "Now that you mention it, that does seem like a rather important detail to leave open..." Yagoda only sighed and buried his face into his hand in response. Bulanov attempted to alleviate the situation before Yagoda began demanding names. "Comrade Yagoda, if I may, how do you think the punishments should be dealt? These investigations, after all, were your idea. Perhaps it would be best if you were the one to decide?" Yagoda lifted his head to respond. "We will show no mercy. These corrupt, incompetent parasites will be shot so that they may never trouble us again. As for those who are too useful to fill with lead, I will decide in due time. From now on, please do not make me do everything myself, comrades." With that, Yagoda left the room. The rest were not far behind."

 IRK.10.t:0 "The Irkutsk Trials"
 IRK.10.desc:0 ""Do the defendants admit to the crimes of treason, espionage, wrecking, terrorism, homicide, rape, arson, public indecency, and anti-Soviet activities?" As the prosecutor aggressively listed off increasingly absurd accusations, one could practically see what little hope had remained in the accused leaving their very bodies. What were once some of the highest-ranking bureaucrats in Irkutsk were now decrepit figures standing before what would become one of the most infamous trials in the town's entire history. The sad, condemned men gave a meek nod in response to the accusations. They had little strength left in them to resist the inevitable.\n\n"The court hereby finds the accused guilty of all charges, and sentences them to the supreme penalty of execution by firing squad!" When these words were said, some men immediately collapsed to the floor and lost their nerve, while others remained standing in cold acceptance of their fate. In no time at all, a group of NKVD soldiers entered and began to violently pull the condemned men out of the ad-hoc courtroom and further into the depths of NKVD headquarters. As they were led through the claustrophobic basement halls, gunshots and panicked yelling could be heard all around them: poor souls who came before them being served their penalties from the barrel of a gun. Some of the prisoners in the group who were still in a state of despair were being dragged by their shirt collars against the ground, kicking and screaming as they went. If these men were going to hell, this place already made it look childish in comparison.\n\nEventually the group was led into a nondescript, concrete room with no windows and only a single dangling light. Some of the prisoners had pictured many places as being their final resting spot, but this glorified bathroom stall was probably the last one they would've expected. The NKVD soldiers ordered the prisoners against the wall, and forcefully shoved those who were too hysterical to move. Soon enough, everyone was lined up and ready."

 IRK.11.t:0 "Our Tactical Lessons"
 IRK.11.desc:0 ""You have to admit, Comrade Bulanov, although they were traitors, they sure as hell fought like devils." Field Marshal Maslennikov said as he took a sip of his vodka. "Indeed, and it still puzzles me as to how the hell they managed to find so many men and so many rifles under such short notice."\n\n"Hah! Just watch our own forces try and mobilize that fast. It would be a goddamn circus act!" Security Chief Bulanov knew that the Field Marshal was mostly joking, but he couldn't help in seeing the hints of some uncomfortable truths in his jest. When the mutiny began, the sheer size of Sablin's army was a cause for great concern amongst both the NKVD and the Red Army's High Command. Bulanov recalled that even General Secretary Yagoda himself was deeply troubled by the mutineers' ability to mobilize so quickly in comparison to his own forces. "If I had the chance, I'd set about whipping the men back into shape as soon as possible. When the time comes to march against the enemy once more, I don't want to be caught with my pants down again, you know?" Bulanov nodded in response as he took a drink. "You should know, Comrade Field Marshal, that Comrade Yagoda had asked for me to open inquiries into the Sablinite war effort. While I do not doubt his stalwart bravery in all things, I do believe he is still somewhat concerned our forces haven't learned anything from the mutiny. What do you think?"\n\nMaslennikov stopped to think for a moment. When he spoke again, he did so in hushed tones. "You want to know what I think, comrade? I think that if we were to combine our tactics with that of the mutineers, there would not be a single force from the Urals to Kamchatka that could hold our armies back." Perhaps it was because he was just a little drunk, but Bulanov began entertaining the thought that Maslennikov's theory might be necessary. Even after he had stumbled home that evening, Pavel Bulanov still couldn't stop thinking about his discussions with the Field Marshal."

 IRK.12.t:0 "The Spirit of the Struggle"
 IRK.12.desc:0 ""What's wrong with them, Maslennikov?" Genrikh Yagoda asked as he walked, not bothering to look back at the entourage that flanked him. The weekly troop inspection had gone without any notable incident as usual, but this time Yagoda seemed much less impressed than usual. "What do you mean, Comrade Yagoda? Was there some kind of problem?" Maslennikov tried to maintain an air of martial professionalism as he spoke, but his tone betrayed a slight hint of fear. Yagoda stopped and finally looked Maslennikov in the eyes. "What do I mean? Did you see them? That boy who sneezed looked like he was about to shit himself."\n\n"Perhaps they fear they'll disappoint you, Comrade Yagoda. Rest assured, the soldiers owe you their utmost devotion and loyalty." Yagoda was still not impressed, and it showed. "The only reason they're loyal is because they're terrified of me, not devoted." After a pause, the walk continued. "Do you remember Sablin's traitors, Maslennikov? Those bastards were willing to follow that damn boy into hell when it came to it. I shudder to think how those frightened souls back there would do in similar circumstances." The group finally arrived at Yagoda's staff car, and the time came for that afternoon's farewells. "Make sure the men are in good order next time, Comrade Field Marshal. I will be in touch." After an exchange of salutes, Yagoda departed from the base.\n\nThe quiet ride gave Yagoda plenty of time to think. He knew that this problem was far more encompassing than just the army. The entire nation saw him as some kind of monster, despite all their efforts to hide these feelings from the public eye. Meanwhile, that bastard Sablin had transformed his image into that of a hero virtually overnight. Yagoda wondered if perhaps he should make some kind of attempt at softening his image. However, Yagoda also knew that he could not risk looking weak in these desperate times. By the time Yagoda had arrived at his office, he had made up his mind."

 IRK.13.t:0 "A Traitor's Words"
 IRK.13.desc:0 "Grigori Grinko took a sip of his coffee, his eyes seemed distant. "It's interesting to me how far the Buryats were willing to go for Sablin's ideas. Are our policies really so terrible? It's not like they've changed much since Bukharin's day, and nobody was raising a fuss back then." Sergey Bessonov, Yagoda's foreign minister, thought of what to say next. Every so often the two would meet in unassuming locales to discuss things that they would never dare to speak of at the workplace, lest they draw the attention of the feared NKVD. This particular morning, they had found themselves in a sleepy cafe in Irkutsk's suburbs, and the subject was dangerously close to becoming more controversial than usual. Bessonov seemed to care little. "Grigori... do you think that maybe his promises held merit?" Grinko immediately halted raising his mug as he heard this, and looked up at Bessonov. "What are you saying, exactly?" He said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"His men were willing to lay down their lives for his ideas, fought us tooth and nail. We may not like it, but there had to be something worth looking at there. It just wouldn't make sense otherwise." Grinko resumed his drinking, his posture slackening once more. "Eh, maybe. How do we know it wasn't just all talk, though? All you have to do is say the right words, and people will die for you. Sablin obviously knew that well, but we'll never know if it was coming from a genuine place."\n\n"Perhaps not. But who's to say we can't succeed where he failed? It would surely go a long way towards endearing us to the people." Grinko looked up at Bessonov again. "Most of what Sablin talked about was utopian drivel, nothing more. The truth is, you can't run an effective government on ideals alone. Though sometimes I think it wouldn't hurt if we reexamined how we approached certain issues..." Bessonov leaned forward. "It wouldn't, right? If only Comrade Yagoda would see it that way.""

I just got off the phone with Bessonov, he says the partisans in Aldan have sent us a response defying our ultimatum and denouncing you as a tyrant! What should we do?"\n\nYagoda's eyes returned to his reading, his face did not betray even the smallest hint of concern. "How very stupid of them. Ochirov must have a death wish. Comrade Bulanov, tell the Field Marshal to prepare his troops for war. I want him to teach those impudent whelps in Aldan a lesson they won't soon forget."

The base of the map itself was from the 1940's, and it had been hastily drawn over in marker to show what the Red Army believed to be the strategic situation. "As you can see, comrades, the Fascists are divided and weak. We couldn't have asked for a better opportunity to strike." Field Marshal Lyushkov said as he gestured towards the enemy positions on the map, represented with lines of red marker. Lyushkov was not wrong. Intel on the situation farther east was not exactly ideal, but it all seemed to suggest that the Fascist warlords were too busy squabbling amongst themselves to offer any serious resistance to an invasion. Yagoda, his attention still focused on the map, spoke up. "Lyushkov, how ready are our forces?" Lyushkov backed away from the map and turned to Yagoda. "As ready as they'll ever be, Comrade Yagoda."\n\n"Then I think, comrades, it is time to put our plans into motion. These fascist dogs have blighted Russia with their toxic presence for too long. It would bring me great pleasure to see them crushed like the vermin they are." Yagoda paused for a moment. "Remember that this is a very important step towards reunification, comrades. First we retake the Far East, then we liberate the rest of Russia and beyond. I will not accept failure, not when the fate of the Soviet Union still lies on the precipice." Yagoda's short speech would resonate heavily with all who heard. The next few months would see the lands of the Far East drenched in blood, and with a great deal of effort and a little luck, only the true heirs to the Soviet Union would remain standing once the smoke had cleared.

The prosecutor was still listing off his accusations, but by now they had become only an inaudible blur of muffled sound. Eventually, though, Ochirov snapped out of his retrospection.\n\n"Gurzap Ochirov, you are charged with committing treason against the people of the Soviet Union.

I have seen what cruelties these Fascists are capable of in victory, and I made a promise to myself to never allow such injustices to happen ever again." The commissar got up and stood in front of his men. He could feel the orator inside him taking over.\n\n"This is not just a war against those who have betrayed the people, but a war against to repulse the dark clouds of Fascism that loom over everything we hold dear. It is not wrong to feel fear, but it is wrong to allow your fear to shape you. Think of your friends, your homes, your loved ones! Would you stand by as these Fascist dogs march in to impose their murderous rule over them? Comrades, put your fear behind you and fill your hearts with rage! Build this anger within you and use it well when the time comes to send these murdering Fascist bastards to an early grave!"\n\nKrukov's short speech was punctuated by fierce, passionate cheers from the men.

Those who were present noted that he seemed strangely calm and collected throughout the whole ordeal. In a few minutes, a single NKVD guard pulled Matkovsky by his collar and led him out of the courtroom.\n\nOnce they had reached the basement door, the guard knocked on the door to be let in. He sighed and stood in front of the door idly, wondering why they didn't just leave it open. The guard's thoughts were interrupted by a sharp blow to the side of his head. As the guard fell to the floor, Matkovsky scrambled to grab his keys. The guard was unable to react before Matkovsky had freed himself and made a run for it.\n\nWasting no time, he sprinted after Matkovsky, and soon the guard was joined by several of his comrades. The NKVD followed Matkovsky as he slipped into the men's bathroom, and they easily broke through the haphazard barricade he had made with his shackles. When they entered, the NKVD soldiers were immediately met with Matkovsky attempting and failing to open a locked window at the end of the bathroom stalls. Realizing he was trapped, Matkovsky gave up and turned to his pursuers.\n\nHe gave a defeated sigh, and called out to them. "Well, get on with it."

The group abruptly stopped in the basement hall, and the commanding officer turned to his comrades.\n\n"Someone get me a rag or a handkerchief or something, we need to shut this idiot up." One of the NKVD then wandered off to find a suitable object, and soon returned with a cloth. As the soldier attempted to gag Rodzaevsky, however, the prisoner headbutted the soldier and began violently shaking and kicking. In this state, moving the prisoner was impossible. Rodzaevsky was in such a rage that he had nearly managed to overpower his captors, despite their numbers.\n\n"You are weak!

Knowing that they would have been effortlessly targeted and "persuaded" by the NKVD, whoever was behind this plan was careful not to reveal their identity, at least before the document had been presented to all Presidium members. For Yagoda, it was too late now - he knew all the deputies and their inclinations better than most, and the outcome of this vote was certain.\n\n"Who is in favor of the dismissal of Yakov Saulovich Agranov as the Premier of the USSR?"\n\nAlmost everyone raised their hands. The hesitant few who did not out of fear soon changed their minds, making the result of the vote, besides two persons, unanimous. One was Yagoda, still not eager to idly follow the wishes of the Party; as for the other, it was Agranov himself. The Presidium had taken advantage of a temporary absence of his in order to initiate this vote without his knowledge. Yagoda was aware that the presence of every single deputy was not necessary to pass a decree - a loophole that had proven extremely useful in the past, but had come back to bite him. Having been left with no other choice, he slowly raised his hand in approval.\n\n"Effective immediately, Comrade Agranov is dismissed of his duties by order of the Presidium, to be replaced by Sergey Alexeyevich Bessonov as Premier of the USSR."

The current General Secretary, Genrikh Yagoda, will assume the duties of Premier while maintaining his current position and powers as General Secretary. Secondly, any votes held on the potential dismissal of Premier Yakov Agranov will be deemed as ineffective, owing to his missing at the time of the alleged decision.

The Russian proletariat can rest assured that the true heirs to Lenin and Bukharin shall restore the glory and freedom which they lost to the Nazi menace.\n\nBut our work is still unfinished. There are still many menaces to the West who we must deal with. Having grown beyond the status of a warlord, we are now a fully functioning state and must develop our nation accordingly. We will have to make great investments into bringing our country up to the standards of the developed nations of the world, and we will now be able to take on a national debt in order to finance our expansion.\n\nOur people cry out for help, and the restoration of our Union awaits them.

Others said that the reunification of the Far East had proved the legitimacy of the Presidium's construction, and had allowed for a true proletarian nation to once again emerge.\n\nWhatever the true reason, none could deny that the state was a far cry from that of only a few years prior. Internal divisions had been removed. Lands had been acquired. Economic and social activities were increasing. Foreign relations were being established.

After the textbooks had been printed he could begin organizing a nationwide initiative to train and hire more teachers. After that the foundations would be laid for his most ambitious plans. New schools, both primary and secondary, would open in every city and town across eastern Siberia, heralding a new age of revolutionary schooling and societal progress. Perhaps even a new university to serve as the crowning achievement, or even...\n\nA knock at the office door broke Boris out of his daydreaming.

"General Secretary" Yagoda now, he was called. A sigh left his mouth for what was the sixth time today, as he thought about how things were becoming.\n\nTraffic was terrible, and the NKVD checkpoints were stifling as always. By the time he had finally made it to the Presidium, he had decided - something needed to be done. Even if Yagoda had eyes everywhere, even if he only grew stronger by the day, he needed to do something. But first, he needed to rally the others.\n\n...After he got past the guard at the door, who kept looking at him and shaking his head, while blocking his path. "Comrade Bessonov, while your service to the Union has been faithful and an admirable example, I cannot let you pass." Sergey blinked. "And just why not?" He asked as the officer blinked, confused.\n\n"Comrade, you were promoted to the Bureau of Agricultural Advisory. Another representative has been selected..." Sergey barely heard the rest; was that why he hadn't been informed of the meeting? A promotion. He had been "promoted", as had the others no doubt. Funneled off, moved out of power, and shuffled to where they could not even touch him. Where the thought of Sergey Bessonov moving against Genrikh Yagoda wasn't just laughable, it was nonexistent.\n\nAnd so, as Sergey Bessonov began to sob, and the guard confusedly looked around unsure of what to do, the General Secretary gave a single passing, small smile from the window before striding into the chamber of the Presidium, not even bothering to glance back at the entrance."

Desk drawers were pulled open, files were leafed through, and people were questioned in droves. And above it all two men stood firm; Nikolai Golubev, a giant of a man with enough feats to his name to make him noteable, even if he seemed to have nothing but indifference to many of his superiors, and Anatoly Denisov, a thin officer who was once a very ideological commissar.\n\nTwo cousins, bound together by the order of Genrikh Yagoda for a single investigation regarding missing funds. And so far, both had not found much yet."You're certain you have no recollection of where these missing funds have gone." Nikolai spoke calmly, as he eyed a brief set of files. "Does this imply incompetence on your part, or does this imply a colleague's responsibility?"\n\n"Well," the Bureaucrat began, after a brief gulp. "I'm fairly certain I saw Gennady skulking around -" Anatonly raised a hand, cutting him off. "Comrade, Gennady stated he saw you skulking around in the evening; in fact, he promptly filed a report implicating you as a suspect instead of waiting until now to divulge this. Tell me, why would you wait to divulge such crucial suspicions until you were filed into a room for questioning?"\n\nA brief pause filled the air, as Nikolai looked up from his files pointedly. "My colleague asked you a question." He boredly stated, as the burecrat slowly looked to them - then the door. For a moment, he looked like he was going to attempt to run.\n\nThis moment ended when a pistol was whipped against the side of his face, while Nikolai reached to a small bag at the side of his chair, withdrawing tools.

I recognize that you have every right to be angry with me for a single moment of weakness. However, I have repented entirely from my heinous actions. You may doubt, you may disbelieve, but I initially took the funds to be used elsewhere, to benefit the Union in different departments.\n\nI see however, that my idealism did not bear the fruit I had thought I would sow. Instead, I entered into a den of ruffians, corrupt monsters, and those who would seek to bring the revolution astray. Thankfully, two brave and intrepid investigators aided in my repentance with a brief visit to my home, in which I realized how far I had been led astray.\n\nTo ask for forgiveness is a challenge, though I offer this. In exchange for amnesty, I will fully cooperate and give the names and addresses of those I know who are involved in the den of bourgeoise corruption. I will retire from my life within Irtusk, and promise to cause no further trouble in future years.\n\nI thank you General Secretary, for your never ending benevolence and understanding, and await your reply."

Then, he had spent time running the Union as it fell apart. And now, once again he was here - waiting.\n\nSilence reigned for a moment before the phone on his desk rang, and he picked it up. "Report." The General Secretary spoke, as two voices jostled for position. "Comrade Yagoda, the raids have been a stunning success! All the conspirators have been arrested or dealt with, and-"\n\n"Anatoly, shut up and let me talk to the General Secretary." The other voice spoke, as a brief bit of murmuring between the two was heard. "Right, Nikolai reporting. We have three dead conspirators, one dead officer, two injured officers. One attempted to flee and was shot, one attempted to kill the men sent to investigate him, and the Junior Lieutenant thought that the third conspirator had nothing to say."\n\n"He was reaching for a gun." Anatoly muttered across the line, as Genrikh sighed. "The informant?"\n\n"Resettled to Chita and given a small stipend for his time, far more generous than the others in the embezzlement scandal will get. I assure you General Secretary, that all of the guilty parties will be held responsible -"\n\n"And their associates monitored. I do not want there to be a chance of anyone slipping the net." The General Secretary interrupted.\n\n"Of course. Why, Nikolai and I will personally see to it!" Anatoly replied with such noise and zeal that for a moment, Yagoda almost imagined the thin man was giving a salute in the middle of wherever they were standing. "I will expect your full report tomorrow." He murmured, as he hung up.\n\nAnd so the General Secretary retired for the evening, while in the distance Nikolai Golubev looked at his partner and gave him a slap.

It could be books, it could be films, it could be anything the Japanese were making.\n\nAnd it was all jotted down on a single, small little paper list that was placed down on his desk every morning. Sometimes it was simply a copy, while other times it was a new one. By this point, every day was the same to Armen - he'd wake up, eat breakfast, bid a goodbye to his wife, go to work, and return home in the late hours of the night.\n\nA cog. That's what he was. A simple gear in the apparatus of state, working day and night for a pension he never seemed to have the time to use. More items were labeled, more items were censored, and the list always arrived at his desk. His wife tried to understand, and he and his coworkers occasionally went out for drinks, but he would always find himself at this desk, accepting orders from above and relaying them down below with little fanfare. An easily replaceable cog, if he stepped out of line- some of his coworkers had already vanished and been replaced.\n\nPerhaps Irina and him should take a vacation - a single brief respite. He owed it to her, after all. Yes. As he lay in his bed for the evening, his wife asleep on the other end, he realized a vacation was exactly what they needed. Tomorrow, when he was done with his shift, he would ask for time off. So, he went forth the next morning with a large smile, stepped into his cubicle, and eyed the piece of paper already laid on his desk.\n\nThe list had been doubled."

Such a system naturally eroded public confidence in the socialist ideal of equal justice, and encouraged corruption besides. No longer.\n\nAt the personal insistence of General Secretary Yagoda the entire system is to be professionalized. Strict guidelines for required qualifications will be developed, systems of licensing examined and overhauled, if necessary, and present officials found to be unqualified removed. In this fashion, the legitimacy of Soviet justice will be ensured, in the eyes of both the people and the world.

At the very least, Viktor could say that he was employed and his family was well fed.\n\nViktor took his position on the line and began the monotonous job of assembling artillery shells. Hours passed him by with little incident, and yet he could not help but think that something was different. It was a small thing, easily able to be missed on the line, but something was different.\n\nAfter another few hours he understood, the line had been going much faster than it had been before. A few words exchanged with his foreman cleared things up well. Apparently, as the foreman relayed to him, some of the inspection points had been eliminated in favor of a more efficient pace for production. He couldn't help but have mixed feelings about these new changes. As the day dragged on he felt like he was falling behind. At first, the new pace was easy to handle, but the further on the day went the worse he felt.\n\nAs he left the plant at the end of the day, he could not help but worry about the quality of some of his work."

And yet, when it finally happened, even he was taken by surprise.\n\nThe early-morning meeting of the Central Committee had actually been called by Yagoda himself, intending to address a series of military and diplomatic incidents along the southern border with Manchuria. However, shortly after it had commenced, he found himself the victim of intense criticism by other members for his supposed 'encouragement of friction within the socialist framework.'\n\nHaving purged many opponents himself over the years, Yagoda knew immediately that he was finished, outmaneuvered yet again. The vote, unanimous of course and as required for a public showing of unity, was a formality. It was over. Still, and facing political oblivion, he found himself unable to stand from the table's head.\n\nHe was suddenly helped to his feet by the strong arms of two Red Army sergeants - no doubt called by Grinko using a small device he could see attached to the inside of the man's jacket - and forcefully directed from the room.\n\nAs he was hustled into the central vehicle in a small convoy and driven out of the city at great speed, he could hear the radio announcing the appointment of Premier Sergey Alexeyvich Bessonov as General Secretary, unifying the positions. That morning, he had been General Secretary Yagoda, and now he was only Comrade Yagoda, destined for internal exile in some remote town where he could do no harm, and be closely watched besides.\n\nHe supposed that he should be thankful.

These soviets will be given authority - within reason - to determine local economic and production goals, tailored to the particulars and relative resources of their province.\n\nThe decisions made by the sovnarkhozy, and the particulars resulting from them, will be consolidated by the central government. Analysis will be subsequently performed by the State Planning Committee, in order to ensure both more efficient economic planning and more realistic production goals year-over-year.\n\nAlthough basic need for the sovnarkhozy has been questioned by some who claim it an unneeded dilution of state authority, both local and national Party officials have made clear their their view of the individual sovnarkhoz as being 'wholly in tune with the socialist spirit of cooperation at all levels.'\n\nTime will tell if such devolution proves beneficial."

When he had seen the advertisement - positions available for junior state planners - his father had told him not to bother. Such jobs went to men of connection, he had said, not men such as him.\n\nBut Morozov was a true believer in the inherent equality of socialism, and he would not be deterred. He wanted to serve his country and its citizens, and he knew he was capable of doing so.\n\nThe men who had controlled things for so long were not only old, they were, largely, not even from Siberia. Irkutsk was not Moscow, and Siberia was not Western Russia. The lands, the challenges, and the people were different, and the new Union required new administrators if it was to prosper and combat the reactionaries, despots, and occupiers that still held most of Russia in their grasp.\n\nWhen he returned home the evening after submitting his application package, having waited five hours in line to do so, and said as much, his father had only scowled. A waste of time, he was told. But as he went to sleep that night, Morozov felt certainty in his future. He would be given his opportunity.\n\nAfter all, the Party had promised equality."

University had taught him that, apart from political reliability, little was more important to a state than its economy. And for the Union, that economy, down to the last sack of corn, was controlled from here.\n\nHe could tell, however, that he was not going to be welcomed by many. The looks that followed him from the senior planners told him as much. But he would not be intimidated. He had been taught in the Komsomol that change was always resisted by those who had accumulated power and, sadly, even once-committed socialists were not immune to perpetuating such resistance.\n\nWhen he was shown to his 'office,' a repurposed broom closet with little more than a rough-hewn desk, a mismatched chair, and a plastic telephone, he knew that those looks had been followed by deeds. But he would respond in kind.\n\nLooking at the stacks of graphs, reports, and production figures that had been stacked in the corner, he felt power run through him. He would learn the Union's economic anatomy. He would diagnose illness. And he would prescribe treatment.

Many were from his university. Or other similar ones. And all, including himself, were close in age. With them changed the atmosphere of the Gosplan office as a whole. Unlike the lethargy that had once dominated it, and had started to get to him once initial excitement had worn off, there was now a collective energy and drive that he was proud to be part of.\n\nProblems that had existed for years were solved through collective innovation. Production pipelines were optimized. Industries were integrated, horizontally and vertically. Workers were reassigned and relocated to maximize skill overlaps. Sources of waste, human or otherwise, were pursued, identified, and ruthlessly eliminated. And with every improvement, the overall projections improved. Things had begun to change, indeed.\n\nThe senior planners no longer looked at him and the other young arrivals with disdain. No, now they looked at them with fear. They knew that things were changing, that the Party had seen the value of bringing a new generation of administrators into the fold.

Below it, he saw the faint outlines of Nerpa seals, unique little fishermen who frequently found themselves pestered by birds.\n\nIn many ways he related to the birds. He was, like them, a pest. While the people of Irkutsk city attempted to carve out lives in this Russian hell, Ilya harassed them. In his head sat thousands of words, snippets of conversations between lovers, friends, families. All of them were stolen, private snapshots of lives acquired via surveillance.\n\nUpon his hands there was much blood. Young and old, idealist and cynic, patriot and traitor. Each had met with Ilya's justice at one time or another.\n\nHe laughed quietly at the dramatic tone of his thoughts. What had made the Sablinites any different?

Completely undisturbed by his presence, the bunny watched the clear lakewater.\n\nAlexei remembered his childhood pets, animals he had found out in the woods that his mother forced him to abandon. Hunching down, he produced his cantine once again and began pouring water into a small divet in the snow.

The NKVD is the only thing keeping our enemies at bay."\n\n"Whatever you tell yourself to help you sleep at night," Sergei said bitterly, downing his vodka and rising from his chair.

 IRK.76.desc:0 "Boldyrev had spent a few nights now sleeplessly, after Sablin's ultimate defeat. Even as he went about his day, his anxiety only barely keeping up with his exhaustion, he looked at his front door whenever he could, hoping to hear a knock from his one and only son, hoping beyond hope that he had escaped capture by Yagoda's thugs. Alisa, bless her soul, worried about his own restlessness, even if she tried to hide it. If he knew Yagoda though, and he did, all too well, then he was not the one she should be worried about. Their son was in greater danger than most people could imagine.\n\nAs Boldyrev was reading a book early in the night, trying to calm himself and finally get some sleep, a knock came. He nearly fell on the floor trying to get up, and ran so quickly to the door he feared he might trip. When he reached the door and opened it, however, the excitement on his face vanished. This was not his son. This was an NKVD officer, his stare cold and unfeeling. "A letter, for you, comrade." Boldyrev opened it, fear quickly building down to his very bones. It was a letter, one first thanking him for his years of service to the NKVD. Then it went on to explain that his son's body had been discovered at the site of the final capture of Sablin, identified by old NKVD friends of Boldyrev who had known his son as a child. It was signed by Yagoda personally. Boldyrev collapsed to his knees, tears streaming out of his eyes, which stared after the retreating back of the NKVD officer. It was useless, utterly useless. Nobody could oppose Yagoda, god damn his name, yet he had been foolish enough to let his son try. It was a choice he would regret for the rest of his days. Even when Alisa, who had been woken by the commotion, came to comfort him, he barely felt it."

 IRK.77.desc:0 "Sablin had really done it. He had won. Yagoda and the rest of his corrupt NKVD bastards had finally gotten what was coming to them. Even as Boldyrev received this news with barely contained glee, he also felt strongly concerned. Too many of Sablin's soldiers would never return home, and he had seen more than one weeping widow or grieving parent since the war had ended. The only question that remained was- would he be among them?\n\nIn the middle of the day, as Boldyrev was washing dishes at the sink, a knock came at the door. He nearly dropped the plate he was holding in his excitement. He wasn't expecting any visitors. Rushing to the door, he threw it open, and he could have almost cried at the sight that greeted him. There was his son, decked out in one of the finest uniforms Sablin's forces had to offer, with a big grin plastered across his face. "I'm home, papa." His son said, his voice almost cracking. "I'm finally home." They embraced, with Boldyrev patting his son on the back to comfort him.\n\nInviting his son inside, Boldyrev called over his wife, who was similarly overjoyed to see her son alive and well. They sat their son down with all the food he could want, and listened as he told them his best stories of the conflict, concluding with the fact that he had been appointed one of Sablin's guards for his distinguished service. For all Boldyrev cared, he could have been a deserter. He was just glad to see that his son was okay."

 IRK_superregional.1.desc:0 ""Long live the rightful government of the USSR," said Daniil into the receiver of the battered old telephone.\n"Yes, yes," said his uncle, Ignaty on the other line. It had been his uncle, a longtime secretary for the communist party, who had managed to get Daniil this job in the administration in the first place. "How are you fitting in over there, boy? Has anyone given you trouble?"\n"No, Dyadya, I've been well, but listen, they've assigned me to write the next reintegration memo, but I-"\n"You've already positioned yourself to be writing important documents in your first month? My god, Daniil, your mother's going to be so proud of-"\n"No, Uncle Ignaty! I don't know the first thing about how reintegration is going! I fell asleep at the briefing because they had me working a double shift yesterday transcribing old speeches!" Daniil felt his throat tighten as he frantically tried to speak without outright shouting for the entire office to hear.\n"Oh, Daniil," Ignaty sighed, "Okay, here's what I know. The territory that's being reintegrated is gigantic, nephew, bigger than any nation could be asked to swallow up at once. Obviously it's going badly compared to past reintegrations, but that doesn't mean it's going horribly. We've been adopting existing administrative entities within the territory as fast as we possibly can, but most are messy entities leftover from the warlords. It's not clean, Daniil, but we're slowly getting the territory plugged into our governmental apparatus. Unfortunately, we'll still need to reform the systems to be better organized soon after. Is it clear, Nephew?""

But my men and my officers only did as I told them to. Let them go."\n\n"No no, don't worry about your officers, they'll be fine, Marshal. Is that a surprise to you, that I still call you that? It is your official title, given to you by the USSR, after all. Listen, Marshal, Comrade Yagoda has some sympathy for you. Your army was given orders by the government: defend the east. And so you did, even when it was no longer clear if a government still existed at all. It's obviously not the case that you were disloyal, Marshal, merely that you were confused as to whom were the rightful heirs to the old government. Well, now you know. It's us."\n\n"What are you getting at," sighed Vasilevsky.\n\n"What I'm getting at is your reputation, Marshal. You received a great deal of criticism for failing to stand up to old Comrade Bukharin when you clearly disagreed with his policies, military or otherwise. What we're saying, Vasilevsky, is that Comrade Yagoda is looking forward to enjoying the same lovely arrangement.""

The numbers weren't adding up, and he had done all he could reasonably be expected to do in order to make them do so.\n\nHe frowned. Money was missing from the budget, too much for it to be a mere error. The perpetrator had done little to nothing to cover his tracks, likely expecting to get away with it due to his rank.\n\nHad he not been clear that the years of corruption were over? That fraud would no longer be tolerable in his government? That transgressions against the legitimacy of the state would be met with death?\n\nPerhaps he had been too merciful in the past, too lenient to truly send the correct message. Yes, if there was one thing that Comrade Yagoda knew was true of himself, it was that he was a merciful man. Anyone else in his position who was looking out over the seditious world he ruled over would have burned it all down.\n\nHis old bony fingers spun the phone dial and he lifted the receiver to his ear.\n\n"Yes, chairman?" asked his secretary.\n\n"There's a man we need to make an example of," Comrade Yagoda said, without joy, but only with duty."

For ten minutes of screentime, villagers are shown to be in a miserable state as Hitler and his Nazis rampage through town. Just when all seems lost, the phoenix rises again, now resembling Comrade Yagoda, and throws the Nazis out, to the cheers and adoration of the town.\n\nThe animation is only 38 minutes long, and foreign observers have derided it as being decades out of date artistically speaking. They may be right, as it most resembles the relatively crude propaganda films that had come out of Japan in the mid 40's, save that the Russian animators had taken special care to ensure that the colour red was in the film, even if the rest of it was black and white.\n\nRegardless of what the foreigners think, it's a hit, and the masses are clearly warming up to Yagoda's cult of personality."

"Yes I do forgive you. The new USSR is not the old one. We are FOR the people, well and truly! We encourage all of you to speak your minds!"\n\n"We all see through your registry scheme, comrade! You just want information on us so we can easily be rounded up!" cried a woman, and Kirill wrote her name down too.\n\n"We DO want to know who and where you are, comrades, but only to know how better to serve you! So we can better know where to distribute your food and any goods you may need," the rep said with an honest smile. "And I know you do not trust me, but I swear to you that this is a new USSR! One where freedom of speech and open dialogue is a protected right! If you need any more evidence of this, consider that the old government would have NEVER allowed you to speak to a party member in this way. Please, comrades, fill out your registry information and do not be afraid to speak, for you are, each of you, safe in your nation!"\n\nKirill smiled as the townspeople reluctantly filed out to the registration tents that had been set up. He flipped his notebook shut and handed it to one of the other plainclothes NKVD agents who was present.\n\n"Round up all those who spoke out, make sure no one knows it's you," Kyrill ordered.

For an instant, a single instant of coldblooded panic and hopeless terror, Genrikh thought he could understand what old Bukharin felt the day they told him that the Wehrmacht had invaded.\n\nGenrikh wasn't there that day, but he had informants who were. They said Bukharin had shrivelled when he heard - wilting like a flower before an inferno.\n\nAnd so, when Yagoda faced the same circumstance, the same test of will - staring national downfall in the face - he knew that he could not flounder as Bukharin had done. Yagoda remained strong, remained composed, and patiently moved to handle the upstart.\n\nGenrikh smiled. It was the first of many tests of his resurgent nation, but there were many more to come.

Though the NKVD has been grumbling quietly about it, it's unlikely that such an organization would protest publicly at the changes, nor does it seem likely that they'll make a move against the party now that stability has finally started to return to the nation.\n\nBessonov drafted legislation this morning to do something unthinkable to many, ending the gulag labour camps and put an end to a nearly forty year old institution of national repression.\n\nTo alleviate concerns that dangerous dissidents are being released out into the nation, Bessonov has arranged for a fair retrial of the forced labourers based upon the modern enforcement of the law rather than the harsh policies of Yagoda.\n\nOther critics have pointed out that the end of the gulags will cripple the state's ability to build infrastructure or other large projects, but the party insists that anything built on the backs of slave labour is not worth being built.\n\nOn the other hand, former prisoners are being formally offered jobs and good wages to continue working in 'construction camps,' though it's unknown how many will take up this offer in favour of leaving the entire nightmare behind."

It was a mass-produced thing that was unworthy of him. And as if the entire matter wasn't insulting enough, the "paperwork" in question, upon a brief look, seemed to be utterly unimportant reports confirming grain shipments to and from irrelevant and impoverished villages on the far fringes of civilization!\n\n"Comrade! I am a member of the Nomenklatura!" he bellowed in anger.\n\n"Yes you are," agreed the bureaucrat with a polite nod. "Now have those reports on my desk by six PM.""

Among other things, a series of rejected propaganda photos which involved a shirtless Yagoda hunting, fishing, and riding on horseback through the wilderness have been passed around with great amusement between the party members.\n\nThe effects of the cult surrounding Yagoda, however, are no laughing matter, as they allowed him to act as an unimpeded dictator that could step over the proletariat as though they were his personal slaves without any fear of retaliation or checks on his power.\n\nAfter the party was finished cackling at a picture of Yagoda holding a leopard (once again, while shirtless,) they elected to prevent such a thing from happening again.\n\nClarifications were made to the public as to what the old administration had been lying about, as well warning the public to never throw away their ability to think skeptically, even when it's the government speaking.\n\nAdditionally, limits were introduced, among other precautions, about how much could be written or broadcast about the chairmen or other important politicians compared to other news topics, to prevent any temptation on the part of future chairmen to force the state media to fixate upon him."

The performance itself was a hit, and while the piece is not considered to be one of the all-time greats of Russian music, it was certainly a welcome new addition.\n\nKuznetzova herself has declined to reveal the identity of the songwriter, insisting that "He would like to remain anonymous." Whoever he is, it's clear that Buryat would like to hear more of his work.\n\nAs if to spoil the fun, a recent arrival in the city, who claims to have resided in Tomsk up until recently, insists that the piece is a rip off of an identical piece of music that had been composed and presented in Tomsk, but merely with a few 'awkward sounding' changes to make the piece sound less subversive to the communist government.\n\nBeing that the work stumbles at a few strange places, despite flowing beautifully elsewhere - it could be that he's right."

No, for his political career as a Humanist went up in flames along with Tomsk's ideals, and unless he accepted the offer gave by the Government in Irkutsk, he may be forced to live in a cold prison cell. Or worse.\n\nBut that would involve betraying his ideals, for Irkutsk was the complete opposite of all his ideals. They did not support the ideas of Democracy, their leaders were the same men that oppressed his former Humanist colleagues, and their leader is a raving despot. For him to even think about accepting their "generous" offer, he would have to swallow his pride whole.\n\nBut are his pride and ideals really worth more than his life?\n\nSwallowing the remainder of the wine he had in his hand, the man swore and dialed the phone."

But Sergei did, and while the other might have complained that it was a waste of resources while the USSR had more important matters to attend to, the truth had been that Bessonov's reforms had built a strong, united, and motivated nation, quite unlike the reluctant police state he had inherited from his predecessor.\n\nGenrikh Yagoda.\n\nBessonov felt his fists curl up in anger at the memories. Socialism was meant to serve the people, not oppress them, and yet to the tyrant-in-chief, the people were nothing more than slaves to his state machinery. So much was at stake with the flourishing state they had preserved here in the far east, and thanks to Yagoda, most of it had been lost or compromised to rebellions.\n\nBessonov promised he would prove himself better, and today he was finally certain that he had done so. But Bessonov had made another promise too, one that would be a lifelong endeavor.\n\nNo one like Yagoda would ever rise to power again."

They always gave the same sentences to so-called traitors anyways, the Red Army bastards, no reason to treat most of the sentences as special. While his supposed comrades might be shaking in their boots right now, Feliks was wise to this communist nonsense. He had fought against the communists since Barbarossa, was more despised by the reds than any of the younger officers on trial here, yet they would give them a fate no kinder than that in store for him. Why live in fear when facing certain death?\n\nAs the judge kept on reading and reading, Feliks found he just couldn't take it any more. Not the flat tone of the judge, not the pitiless glares of the soldiers, and certainly not the boys dressed up as men on trial beside him, unable to accept their fate. "Enough!" Feliks roared at last, slamming his handcuffed fists on the table before him. "My charges and verdict are irrelevant. Get to the damned execution, you spineless freaks." Anger flashed across the faces of a couple of the soldiers, who raised their guns, but the judge motioned for them to stand down. "Very well, Mr. Sokolov." Feliks was surprised the man even bothered remembering his name. "The court hereby finds you guilty. Your sentence is summary execution. Comrades, escort these men out to the field, and tie them to your posts."

But what were they all yelling about? He got closer.\n\nIgor realized that, bereft of other ways to spend their time, the soldiers and prisoners appeared to be debating politics. "How can somebody be a hereditary reactionary? That's just racism in Marxist language! Hitler called it 'national socialism' too!" one soldier said to the assembled captives. His comrades nodded in agreement.\n\nA prisoner, seated on the opposite side, quickly retorted: "Hitler wasn't a Marxist. Comrade Serov simply recognizes the fact that people inherit the class status of their parents, extended to entire bourgeois cultural groups, like the Jews. If it's genuine Marxist credentials you want to talk about, why is it that your butcher Yagoda slaughters legions of other communists and hands over the country's resources to the bourgeoisie?"\n\n"Is the red Hitlerite really calling us revisionists?" butted in another voice.\n\nIgor wisely decided to stay out of the discussion.

What has kept us strong and stable for these decades is nothing other than the political acumen of Comrade Yagoda, the will of the people, and the strength of the NKVD, the shield and sword of the Revolution. With our trained NKVD officers and unmatched security apparatus, we are to be finally safe from threats internal and external - free to put down the traitors and reclaim the proletarian state."
