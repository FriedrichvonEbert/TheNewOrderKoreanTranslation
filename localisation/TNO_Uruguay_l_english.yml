 POLITICS_COUNCILURG_DESC: "Originally founded in 1952 by Luis Batlle, the concept goes back to Luis Batlle's uncle, Jose Batlle y Ordoñez, who made it official in the 1918 constitution. However, after Gabriel Terra's coup d'etat in 1933, the Council was disbanded for the better part of 19 years.\n\nThe National Executive Council has gained a reputation for stalling at every point, and it is highly disliked among the people. The parliament is debating its abolition, the possibility of moving back to a presidential system, like what existed before Batlle's reform.\n\nHowever, §ROrthodox Batllists§! are absolutely livid that people are fighting to ruin Batlle's legacy, and if things go south, they won't hesitate to sabotage the §OColorado§! party. If the party is divided, the §MBlancos§! would gain power, which would undo most every step that Uruguay has taken forward with all those Reichsmarks Germany has given us. Knowing the §WHerrerists§!, they'd gladly tank the economy if that means kicking both Americans and Germans from Uruguay.\n\nAnd honestly, at this point, what's the damage done?\n\nWell, really, the damage to working class families whose jobs in the industrialised areas of the country depend mostly on German and American funding, would be monumental. And the controversial push for nationalisation of the Rincon del Bonete dam, a pet project of Fernandez Crespo, would not only harm the economy but also our relations with Germany.\n\nLet's just hope it doesn't come down to that."
 
 # Ministers #
 URG_Victor_Haedo_hog: "Eduardo Victor Haedo"
 URG_Victor_Haedo_hog_desc: "At 61 years of age and with no lack of experience, Victor Haedo is primed and ready to be the head of the executive council. After over fifty years as an opposition party, the Blancos have managed to finally attain a majority in a system designed by the Colorados. Haedo is pushing hard to keep the Blancos in power, but his nerves are getting the better of him."
 URG_Homero_Martinez_pol: "Homero Martinez Montero"
 URG_Homero_Martinez_pol_desc: "A navy man, Homero Martinez was never one to stand back and watch his country be mauled by German and American interests. Yet once he took power as Foreign Relations minister, he realized the reality of having to deal with the most powerful nations on the planet. He can't help but  bend over backwards for them. His navy experience never prepared him for this!"
 URG_Juan_Eduardo_Azzini_eco: "Juan Eduardo Azzini"
 URG_Juan_Eduardo_Azzini_eco_desc: "'The Reformer', as he's called, Juan Eduardo Azzini has truly turned the economic system in Uruguay on its head. Since his ascendancy he has managed to change the way foreign currencies are exchanged, making the process simpler and easier to manage. It seems he wants to keep the cash flowing in Uruguay- efficiently, of course- and with the country profiting from the Colorados' deals with Germany, he's succeeding quite nicely and looking good in the process."
 URG_Nicolas_Storace_sec: "Nicolas Storace Arrosa"
 URG_Nicolas_Storace_sec_desc: "A father of nine children, Nicolas "Chiche" Storace is a man of unyielding will. As in his home life, his role in the government has been to keep the country stable by whatever means necessary. Crushing worker's strikes and any radical moves by the various factions, he seems set on the idea of keeping the sheep in place. And things should carry on fine, so long as no destabilizing external influence enters Uruguay. But that won't ever happen- right?"

 URG_switzerland_mirage_1:0 "The Switzerland Mirage" # Believable
 URG_switzerland_mirage_1_desc:0 "To the extent that Bulgaria is the Prussia of the Balkans, Or Ostland a "model colony," so is Uruguay the Switzerland of America.\n\nWhile the Uruguayan political class, convinced of the lasting achievements of José Battle's welfare state, fervently believes in the myth, the mirage of Uruguayan Switzerland is rapidly fading in the eyes of most people.\n\nInflation, the scarcity of food, joblessness, and the impossibility of capital accumulation are common complaints of everyday Uruguayans, particularly in Montevideo and Colonia. This malaise is most strongly symbolized by the omnipresent bus-shaped piggy banks, used for household savings, and the never-ending lines outside passport offices, where most of Uruguay's trained professionals wait for an opportunity to emigrate.\n\nThe truth is Uruguay is broke, and its model of development worn out beyond usability. While it desperately needs replacement, that is not yet evident to most people, who still believe that the present crisis will pass and things return to normalcy. The inevitability of economic change notwithstanding, popular perception of the Switzerland myth remains important for maintaining faith in the democratic system. If this is not done, certain groups could start to become popular, and others might get ideas about their role in the system. Not to mention, its also a good tag-line for foreign investors..."

 URG_blancos_colorados_colegiado:0 "Blancos, Colorados, y el Colegiado"
 URG_blancos_colorados_colegiado_desc:0 "Inspired by the Swiss Federal Council, the Consejo Nacional de Gobierno is the highest authority of the Uruguayan government. A collective presidency, the Consejo is made up of six members from the party that won the elections, and three members from the runner-up party. This system was first set up in 1952 and for a decade it has safeguarded Uruguayan democracy in a continent wrought with dictatorships and authoritarianism - however, it is not without its critics, for many lament the Colegiado system's inherent slowness, ineffectiveness, and over-bureaucratization.\n\nThe system has compounded complaints about Uruguay's two-party system, which stretches back to 1836. Many argue that the Colegiado system is an instrument designed to prolong and further perpetuate the dominance of the Blanco and Colorado parties. While the Colorados - in power uninterruptedly from 1865 to 1958 -  represent the urban population and the intellectuals, the Blancos uphold the interests of the rural countryside, and the Church. Whether they manage to uphold this hegemony any longer, through the colegiado or otherwise, remains to be seen."
 URG_shadow_war:0 "Clash of Shadows"
 URG_shadow_war_desc:0 "There is something very wrong with Uruguay. While ordinary citizens go about their day, terrorist  activities target members of the jewish community, financial crimes go unnoticed, and suspicious activities take place in foreign embassies. The players in this game, in which the pawns are the lives of innocent people, are evidently interested in Uruguay for something, although perhaps something greater than the Oriental Republic itself.\n\nWhatever the case, the Shadow War taking place in our national borders does give credence to the myth of an American Switzerland in one sense: It is filled to the brim with spies."
