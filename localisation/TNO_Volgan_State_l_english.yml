 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_KARL_DONITZ_DESC:0 "Dönitz is a man of means and a man of ideals. A staunch supporter of the Reich from its violent birth to its seemingly violent end, he has seen his even more beloved Kriegsmarine slowly burn away in the flames of rebellion and ruination. While many ships have abandoned the Reich's cause to find harbor with the various supporters, namely the liberals with Speer, Dönitz knows that only one man can truly save the Reich from damnation.\n\nWho better than Bormann? A strong leader, a protégé of Hitler himself, and a staunch believer in the Reich's ideals. Sadly, the Kriegsmarine is no longer safe in harbors where any day another wretched traitor may simply seize their ships to continue their degenerate causes.\n\nLuckily, Dönitz had already secured a 'civilian' post overseeing the ports of VLGmea on behalf of the local governor. With dozens of naval ships in port every day and with many an able bodied sailor to aid him, overthrowing this weak governate for the betterment of the Reich was simple. Now he sits in VLGmea, waiting for the day his ships can once more return to the mainland and aid the Reich in its glorious rebuilding."

### Events ###
 VLG.4.t:0 "The Wolgabund Coups The Government!"
 VLG.4.desc:0 ""As is often the case in times of crisis, major happenings create ripples which, for the smaller players involved, may result in catastrophic consequences. Once such situation is unraveling right now in Kosakenstadt, the capital of the recently-established Wolga Staat, a hotbed for political confrontation due to the contrast between the native Germans, mostly moderates, and the recent settlers, who are loyal to the NSDAP.\n\nThe political balance of the region had always been tenuous at best, but it has broken out entirely in the last days following the decision taken by Helmuth von Pannwitz to support Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner in his bid to bring peace to the region through military force: as soon as the news was out, the moderate parties of the Wolgabund immediately denounced the government, but most had thought it would be the swansong of the Wolga democratic institutions.\n\nThey were disappointed this morning, as a flurry of contradictory news coming from Kosakenstadt report of a coup instigated by the native Germans against the administration. All of them agree on the fact that Pannwitz, due to the little support he enjoyed among the local populace, has been ousted from power, but some sources report that the progressive wing of the Wolgabund managed to form a new government, while others insist that this honor has fallen upon the conservatives.\n\nAs the situation stabilizes, and the first official statement from the new administration come in, there are no more doubts..."
 VLG.4.a:0 "The liberals are in power!"
 VLG.4.b:0 "The social democrats lead the Wolga Staat!"
 
 VLG.5.t:0 "The Freikorps Attack the Wolga Staat!"
 VLG.5.d:0 "When Ferdinand Schörner took power in Moskowien, he had expected all the regional administrations to follow him. Such was not the case, as we have condemned the Feldmarschall and his plans for Eastern Europe which will only bring ruin to all parties involved. Most believed that such a bold statement would not remain unpunished, and today they haven't been disappointed.\n\nAfter several days of tense wait, we were almost starting to believe that they would be able to weather the storm, but it had all been a ploy. With the help of the loyal Freikorps in Kaukasien, the Feldmarschall has launched a pincher offensive in order to subdue us! The mercenaries have struck from the South, while Schörner waits for the perfect moment to attack from the North.\n\nReports coming from the border tell of skirmishes between the first vanguards of the Freikorps and our border outposts, but the situation is escalating quickly. All attempts to reach a peaceful resolution of the crisis have been rejected, and we are officially in a state of war."
 VLG.5.a:0 "We won't give up our freedom!"
