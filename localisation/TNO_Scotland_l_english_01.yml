 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_JOHN_MACCORMICK_DESC:0 "Some men throughout history are considered great through their blood. Others are considered such for great victories of blood and tears. John MacCormick is all the more astounding for needing neither to achieve his goal in life. Born in 1901 to a captain and a nurse, there was little to mark MacCormick as a man to be watched in his early years. Though from an early age associated with Scottish nationalists, MacCormick and the SNP he helped found were more moderate, but the constant failures of the English leadership causing the deaths of countless young Scotsmen swiftly changed that view over the course of the 2nd war with Germany. War caused his party to go from strength to strength, increasingly drawing even more moderate Tories and Labour party members to the SNP simply to be free of Britain's accursed battles. But for all that MacCormick remained loyal to the United Kingdom almost until the end.\n\nAt the same time as the official surrender was sounded, MacCormick began approaching the ragged remnants of the 51st Highlanders when they regrouped in Edinburgh under Douglas Wimberley. It was an act of convenience and desperation, but with Wimberley at his side MacCormick marched into a hastily convened parliament in Edinburgh castle, made up of those few southerners who refused to accept the surrender but more importantly the majority of politicians from Scotland proper. Scotland could, 'either surrender to German tyranny for a thousand years chained to England, or keep the flame of liberty alive if separate and independent.' Perhaps it was his oratorical skills or perhaps it was the presence of an obvious military man like Wimberley at his side, but MacCormick organized Scotland's declaration of independence within just 24 hours of his speech at Edinburgh. A military was founded, a constitution written and the Germans were informed that as Scotland was no longer a part of the United Kingdom it would not be occupied as per the peace treaty.\n\nScotland's road since independence has been a rocky one, with MacCormick treading the fine line between appeasing the Germans and keeping what remnant of freedom he can find alive. Wimberley has grown somewhat distant from MacCormick over the years, some say because the man views even business with the hated conqueror as being a step too far. Yet Scotland under MacCormick has seen something of a renaissance as well, with a constant trickle of English refugees, be they political or economic, seeking relief from southern oppression. Yet after nearly twenty years at the reigns MacCormick is beginning to tire, and some wonder if perhaps, it is time for another to take the reigns of the land of the free."

 POLITICS_DOUGLAS_WIMBERLEY_DESC:0 "Born in 1896 Douglas Wimberley was present for the rise and fall of the United Kingdom. From it's height in 1921 to it's fall and dissolution in 1945, as a commander in the ill-fated British Army he watched as the pieces started to fall around him. Recalled from Africa for the defence of the homeland he would fight valiantly to defend the UK and then the newly established Republic of Scotland. Although failing in defending the UK from collapse he would be instrumental in defending the fledgling Scottish Republic from defeat at the German hands and this leadership earned him the position of Field Marshal of the Scottish Armed Forces. From this post he watched with weary eyes at the new Unity-Pakt and the collaborationist England to the South, ever watchful for the oncoming invasion. He pledged to ensure that never again would his homeland fall to the boots of German soldiers and treads of their tanks. This pledge would shape the man that Wimberley would become and in turn shape the Scottish Armed Forces, making it become a haven of anti-German and anti-Pakt paranoia which would grip it to it's core. With the traitorous government removed Wimberley has now saved Scotland from stagnation and defeat and is at the precipice of greatness. However he is old and he must retire soon, his successor will inherit a difficult position as the Scottish people grow in their opposition to the new post-coup government."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BOSWELL_DESC:0 "Born in 1928 Alexander Boswell was present to the Second World War and the collapse of the United Kingdom, as a young nationalistic Scot he fought to defend his fledgling republic from the jackboots and tank treads of the Germans. After the ensuing peace he rapidly rose through the ranks to become a high ranking officer in the Scottish Army becoming what some would call a protege to ageing the Field Marshal, Douglas Wimberley. Enthusiastically against any form of rapprochement with the German Reich and it's Pakt puppets he would become a staunch supporter of the Field Marshal's extreme stance on Germany and many saw him as Wimberley's expected successor in a couple of years. The coup changed little and only cemented Boswell's position as the expected and almost guaranteed successor to the new Wimberley led government. With the beloved Douglas Wimberley dead Alexander Boswell has assumed the office of Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff and now has complete control over Scotland. He must navigate the difficult path of continuing the military dictatorship while keeping the people happy, ever watchful of any German attempt to interfere in the beloved Republic of Scotland."

 POLITICS_PRISCILLA_BUCHAN_DESC:0 "It would be nigh impossible to find a woman more dedicated to the ideal of Great Britain on the isles than the leader of the Unionist Party, The Rt Hon. Lady Tweedsmuir Priscilla Jean Fortescue Buchan, a woman who has won an extremely unexpected success against incredible odds.\n\nBorn to a Brigadier, Mrs. Buchan, or at the time Priscilla Thomson, always had a silver spoon in her mouth. Studying in England, Germany and France Pre-War, she eventually settled down with Major Sir Alan Lindsay Grant, and had two daughters in 1934. In 1939, like many families, her husband went back to war, and she went to war as any good englishwoman did, working on the production lines. In 1944, she received news. Her husband had died on the German front to a bullet wound, leaving her a widow and her daughters fatherless. She waited from that day for the Germans to be eliminated from the isle, but that day never came, as MacCormick declared the Republic of Scotland.\n\nAfter the war, things happened fast. Motivated by her love of the UK, she entered politics immediately, skyrocketing through the ranks of the Unionist Party due to her sharp oratory skills, gaining prestige throughout as the main representative of English Exiles. She remarried to the exile John Buchan Jr., son of the former governor-general of Canada and veteran of the war in 1946, adopting the name Priscilla Buchan.\n\nHowever, in the 60's, something strange began to happen to the Unionist Party. An influx of certain members, of military men from England began to enter the party, gaining considerable influence through threats and violence, slowly growing roots. Buchan has issues with these men, of course, but now she has power. She cannot tell the people of Scotland of their fate, but she hopes that they can be part of a greater people. A British people."

 POLITICS_ROBERT_MCINTYRE_DESC:0 "Men of vision are often ignored, but their vision is sometimes rewarded. Such was the case with Robert McIntyre.\n\nA medical student at Edinburgh University, Robert was initially attracted to the Labour Party, and became a member in 1936. However, he increasingly became disillusioned with the organization, which culminated in him leaving it in favor of the Scottish National Party in 1940. Quickly, he rose through the ranks of the movement, becoming membership secretary and then National Secretary. In the meantime, he continued his work as a general practitioner in the field of public health in several hospitals around Britain, before being elected as the first SNP member of parliament in a by-election during the war.\n\nAfter the Scottish Constitutional Convention declared Scotland's independence from the UK, it was time for the ones with the vision of an independent Scotland to be rewarded. As the highest profile politician in the party, and one who had oftentimes butted heads with the more moderate John MacCormick over Scottish independence, McIntyre was the obvious choice for the role of Prime Minister of Scotland, and the one to officially head Scotland through the tumultuous early years of independence, a job which he has done fairly successfully.\n\nDespite all that ails the young nation from within and without, Robert McIntyre's unwavering commitment to a free and independent Scotland, unshaken since his early days as a student, will always be there. And that may just be enough to guide it through these times."
 
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_WOLFE_DESC:0 "People often say they have determination, but when it comes down to the line they don't. William Wolfe is not one of those people.\n\nBorn in 1924, William has certainly seen the world change. After being educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, the world looked full of possibilities for the young man. The war then broke out and he joined the Scottish Horse unit of the Royal Artillery. As the very war he had fought in had been brought home, he strived for one thing. Scottish Independence.\n\nOnce Scotland was independent he joined the very party that had made Scotland independent, the SNP. However, unlike some of the members, he had views that would not mesh with the greater ideals of the SNP such as his stance on unions. Protests had started with disenfranchised workers who wanted to have more rights. Wolfe and some others supported the unions, the main body of the SNP did not. He left looking for a party that he could support with his ideals, and then he joined the Independent Labour Party.\n\nWhen William Wolfe joined the ILP, it was a shell of the old Labour Party in Scotland, and seemed to be getting smaller by the day. With determination and grit, he went to work on making the ILP a legitimate left-wing contender for the Scottish elections. He succeeded in doing this and the ILP was soon seen as the main challenger to the SNP in elections. Now in power, the ILP wants to steer Scotland away from the influence of other nations and factions such as the OFN. William Wolfe will do anything to keep Scotland independent."

Our prisons are overflowing and our people are scared, we must act fast to eradicate this threat from Scotland at all costs.

After limiting the press, we will enable a state sponsored press service known as the United Scottish Paper.

The members of this police force will be collected from military service, soldiers with a record of being forceful.

It seems like a very one sided question at this point, the more we advocate for "Scottish made products", the more money flows to them and then we garner more support from the people. It seems all very simple. Our concessions will be straight and lucrative. Things such as tax breaks, lessened safety checks. These will enlarge the output of these businesses that support us.

This will be seen as a reduction of our rule but this is only to gain the hearts and minds of the Scottish people, of course the elections will be influenced and our enemies will be banned from running, but to the people it's a return to normalcy.

And with this belief, and the wisdom of a few others, they accomplished it.\n\nScotland is the only free and independent democracy in Europe.

But sending refugees fleeing fascist oppression back is unconscionable. So we should try being pragmatic for the time being. Who knows?

Yet, we now find ourselves confronted by an undeniable fact. Scotland is no longer composed of Scottish people. A large number of English have moved here since the war and are fully intent on staying here.\n\nAs much as we want to believe these English are all spies and saboteurs from down south, any decision based on fact has to recognize these people are worthy of our respect.

We've enforced strict requirements to promote the learning and usage of the Scottish language so we can bring it back. Unfortunately, many of the English refugees are complaining these classes are "too hard" and the requirements are "too strict."\n\nThough reducing these requirements for Anglos seems a bit unfair, the benefit is that it removes a sore spot in the community.

We have been treating them as an existential threat to the nation of Scotland since the beginning. Maybe we should cut back on that a bit.\n\nIt's time to realize that most English in Scotland accept that Scotland isn't going to be joining England anytime soon.

That it is a maze of barbed wire, trenches, and hidden pillboxes and bunkers. We will not leave any weak links where the English may surprise us. Hadrian once built a wall to keep us out.

Whether this is due to an economic failure on the part of the pakt or our own ingenuity is of little concern. The point is, we are about to become the biggest economy on the isles.\n\nThis booming economy is a point of pride for us. And we intend to keep it that way. We will provide economic aid to keep it growing.

During the war, however, the company was hurt when most of its assets were seized by the collaborators when it was captured by the Nazis. Now called Scottish Rail, the company is still struggling without its lines south of the border. Maybe we can help.\n\nA subsidy program will aid the company tremendously. But this isn't just a slush fund they can divvy out to the executives and stockholders.

This will help Scotland Rail out tremendously, and what's good for them is good for our transportation."

Let's make the most of it. We only have a limited amount of time until the next election. And the first ILP government must be a historic and productive one."
 SCO_ILP_A_Scotland_For_the_People_desc:0 "For all the talk of Scotland being delivered to her own people, the SNP has never really done things that would improve the lives of them. The rural areas are forgotten. Workers toil for long hours and no pensions if they find themselves unemployed. The English refugees remain destitute. Unions and any attempts to organize are stopped dead in their tracks. And the government remains oblivious and opaque to those who watch it. This ends now. We are the ones who will not only truly deliver Scotland to her people, but make her work for them instead of the other way around."
 SCO_ILP_For_The_English_as_well_desc:0 "The English refugee had been given a burden that few of us can bear. They have lost much under the collaborators in England, and they have lost more when they fled up here. And we treat them like trash, the unwanted refuse of a hostile society. Their poverty and struggle is a stain on all of Scotland, and our treatment of them is a far larger one.\n\nWe will be clear, Scotland is for all the people who live in it, regardless of where they are from. We have a duty to care for and help these people. Then, we can show these refugees a truly shining example of democracy, one where society benefits all, and not just a few at the top of a race based oligarchy."
 SCO_ILP_Language_dispensation_desc:0 "We agree that the Scottish Language should be brought back as part of our attempts to rebuild our culture after years of neglect and destruction. However, we would be lying to ourselves if we cannot admit that certain aspects of the SNP's language classes have some faults. English students are hit especially hard, since they scarcely have opportunities outside of class to put their skills to use. It's hardly fair to force another unreasonable hurdle between them and graduation. If we reduce the requirements, we won't be promoting as strong a cultural identity as before, it's true. However, we strengthen Scotland by allowing the English students to integrate more easily."
 SCO_ILP_culture_allowances_desc:0 "Despite what some say, English and Scottish people are actually quite different. One is descended from the celtic villagers that have lived here since time immemorial. The other has extremely strong ethnic ties to the germanic tribes that settled the island after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Despite years of close proximity and interaction, we still have pretty significant differences, ones that the SNP has ignored. We would be wise to keep these cultural differences in mind, and allow a bit of room for them. It will make our relationship better in both the short and the long run! "
 SCO_ILP_Calming_down_the_nationalism_desc:0 "The Independent Labor Party is made up of loyal Scottish people, who love this land, our heritage, and our way of life. Regardless of what some of our more extreme members think, we stand committed to the freedom and dignity of the Scottish people with no compromises. And that will never change. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't tone it down a little.\n\nConstant nationalism and xenophobia isn't really helping our relationships with the English minority. They are feeling harassed and threatened by this, just because they were originally from a different part of the isle. Let's just keep in mind that it's ok to be Scottish, but it's not ok to fight your neighbors over it."
 SCO_ILP_Making_Promises_desc:0 "The biggest concern most English have is for their friends and family that are still on the other side of the wire. It's more prominent an issue than most that affect the English here in Scotland. And addressing it would go a long way to making them comfortable.\n\nWe will make clear to every group of exiles that our greatest foreign policy goal is the liberation of the island and the establishment of a democratic government to the south. If we can convince them we really mean it, then we'll take care of the biggest concern of many refugees. And it will make them exceedingly happy.\n\nOf course, if this doesn't come to pass, we'll be in major trouble."
 SCO_ILP_Wimberley_is_a_madman_desc:0 "Without a doubt, the most dangerous man in Scotland is Field Marshal Douglas Wimberley. Not dangerous in the sense that the Germans or collaborators are, but as dangerous to Scottish democracy, if not more. He constantly oversteps the military budget and spends it on expensive military purchases, unapproved research, and unnecessary warships. That alone is enough for concern.\n\nBut more worrisome is what happens if we say "no" to him too often. He's convinced that the Germans are coming, and we must be ready, regardless of the outside circumstances. If he thinks we're in his way, he'll do something dangerous, and a democracy must never be in this situation. He needs to go, or at the very least, sidelined."
 SCO_ILP_But_he_is_sometimes_right_desc:0 "With that said, Wimberley does have some relevant and constructive criticism regarding the state of our national defense. Specifically toward our ability to arm and resupply ourselves. Recently, he has fixated on our domestic arms industry being small and unable to equip our forces, saying that we must step in. And we agree with that assessment.\n\nThe surest way to solve the problem is through a direct subsidy to the arms industry. With some more money, we can get them to focus on expanding production of weapons. A new facility would help our situation quite a bit. And, hopefully, calm Wimberley down quite a bit."
 SCO_ILP_Empower_the_unions_desc:0 "People forget that everything in their lives comes from a working person somewhere. The food they eat, the clothes they wear, the home they live in, all of it comes from the working people of Scotland. For too long, we ignored them, stepped on them, and crushed them. No more!\n\nFufilling our mandate, unions will now have our full support. They are the backbones of worker representation, both the ones that exist, and the ones that will. No longer will we attempt to break them up and leave the proud men and women in them high and dry. And no longer will the regulations of the SNP keep the organized worker down. The ILP will heed labour's call, and so shall the toilers of our nation!"
 SCO_ILP_Empower_the_Workers_desc:0 "Just working with the unions isn't enough. What good does that do for the workers of Scotland who aren't in one? They may be too poor to pay for the dues, or struggling to organize their workplace, or simply choosing to piggyback on the hard work of their organized brethren. Well, we're going to improve their lives, if they fight for it or not. We'll introduce some legislation limiting the hours they have to work. And thus, we will fulfill the old cry of "eight hours for work, eight hours for sleep, and eight hours for what we will.""
 SCO_ILP_Welfare_state_desc:0 "If the worker works, they eat. If they don't, they starve. It's as simple as that, supposedly. But what happens when the capitalist decides that hiring the worker would cut into their share of profit too much? Then the worker starves through no fault of their own. This is the state of Scotland right now. But it doesn't have to be.\n\nUnemployment payments will insure those who have no choice but to look for work may be able to pay for their basic needs while they do so. It's not much, but it is better than nothing. And that might be enough to save many from poverty and homelessness."
 SCO_ILP_Empower_the_People_desc:0 "Despite the charges of some, we are not a communist party. We don't make decisions for the good of our party. Nor are we a "worker's state," where the employed make the important decisions. We are a party that believes the government should work for all the people, those who vote for us, and those that don't. Those who work, and those too young or infirm to. The people of Scotland will know that we work for them, and they will believe in us.\n\nAn ILP government is a government that is transparent and open, allowing the common person to know what we are doing or how we make decisions. An ILP government is a government that interacts with the people it represents on a regular basis. An ILP government is a government that people can trust and believe in. And we'll make sure that even if it isn't an ILP government, Scotland will remain as open and accessible as one."
 SCO_ILP_Connect_the_nation_desc:0 "Scotland was never regarded as the shining jewel of the British Empire, and the state of our infrastructure shows this. While they preferred to concentrate on grand projects in Canada, India, and Africa, our roads and railways were few and far between, and rapidly aging. And the problem has only gotten worse with age. If we put some funds toward infrastructure construction, we can repair some old roads and bridges, while providing some new ones. It will also put plenty of unemployed Scots to work. In the end, everyone benefits from this project, so why not do it?"
 SCO_ILP_Provide_jobs_desc:0 "Everyone wants the government to stay out of private industry. That is, until they start sinking. Then they demand a bailout.\n\nInstead of just paying people to build dams or paint the walls of post offices, why don't we put them into an actual, permanent job? As much as we might not want to admit it, it is inefficient to just do make-work projects all the time until we hit full employment. Investing in some commercial workshops will keep the same people out of the breadlines. And it will also grow the Scottish economy by improving industrial output. We'll eventually run out of bridges to build, but Scotland will never stop wanting more goods in their stores."

Thankfully, our contacts inside the ministry are willing to delay the flow of information and the official reaction long enough for us to secure our positions inside Edinburgh.\n\nOur friends in the police have also declared their support for our cause, and have promised not to take any action when we begin our coup.

Their support of the Independent Labour Party is a problem - not just to the safety and success of the nation, but also to our government. Many of the acts and reforms that our government has passed would invariably be repealed or undermined by the efforts of the weak ILP. This is simply unacceptable.

After analysis from our experts and intelligence officers who had been in England observing the regime, we have decided to began to prepare for an intervention on the side of the collaborators to usher in unification faster. Meetings have been prepared for talking to sympathetic generals and even discussion with officers in the upper echelons of the HMMLR military tree.

This is our destiny to help the English and begun reunification of the isles. We need to win this war at all costs, our future and livelihood depend on our actions in the coming months.

 SCO_UPECW_Inform_Claude_desc:0 "As we do plan to intervene in the English Civil War, it makes sense to tell the leader of HMMLR, the famous general and member of parliament, Claude Auchinleck that we are intervening. Due to the status of the war in England, our border security had been elevated in case of an attack by the Collaborators. This now means that we cannot send a diplomat through the border without garnering suspicion from the garrisons. However, we can send spies across the border to make contact with Auchinleck and the other leaders of HMMLR to inform them of our plans to intervene in the civil war."

While they had been ineffective in North Africa during the Second World War, they have been quite a nuisance for the Collaborators due to their stealth tactics and handiness with explosives. Some of their former members have started a branch in Scotland to help their brothers in England and they have offered to help us train our soldiers as they get ready for the war against the Collaborators. This includes Paddy Mayne, the leader of the group in Scotland, and a member of the UP."

Our plans include sending weapons to help the fledging army of HMMLR, send SAS agents into England to bomb the Collaborators, and cause trouble. Finally, we shall send in an expeditionary force that will help HMMLR in the war. We have begun to assemble the force that will be sent, it will be largely made up of exiles and soldiers with unionist sympathies."

In the coming days we will start to prepare divisions to be sent to England to fight in the civil war. They will be made up of mostly trained Scottish soldiers who can be trusted to be sent to England. Some of the units however will also have a large contingent of English refugees who have entered the military to help reunify the British Isles. This group will be small at first but they will be very well trained to fight against the menace that is the Collaborators. If the situation worsens or HMMLR needs more soldiers to fight, we will send a larger group."

The reinforcement companies will be the same composition of the ones that we had sent to England earlier however this time they will be better armed now that we have the industry to spare for them. This force will be ordered over the border to meet up with the rest of the Scottish Expeditionary Force to discuss tactics and a battleplan."

 SCO_UPECW_Transfer_Weapons_desc:0 "The operation has been finalized and then greenlit by the president. We can begin the first phase of the operation by sending HMMLR weapons. Our intelligence forces have told us that the best way to get weapons to HMMLR is to load them onto fishing boats and send them across the Irish or North Sea in the dead of the night. Once they reach a friendly port or even a beach, they can signal the shore with a small lamp, and then the exchange will occur. Mostly small arms will be ferried over at first and then large weapons such as anti-tank weaponry and anti-air weaponry once the transfers have been proven to be safe."

Our small fleet of arms smuggling boats has been changed even more. They now have extra room in their holds for even more weapons or surplus. We have now gotten the green light for phase 2 of Operation Northern Woods, the sending of supplies to HMMLR. We have already marked things such as medical supplies, uniforms, and boxes of rations to be sent to HMMLR to make them a more efficient fighting force against the Collaborators."

 SCO_UPECW_SAS_Agents_desc:0 "Now that we have armed and supplied HMMLR and they are operating more efficiently, we can begin to prepare for our attack on the Collaborators. We should first send in the SAS to England to cause havoc on the Collaborators. They will serve as an advance force for the main body that will later come. Once they are sent, they will be under joint command by the central Scottish Government and David Stirling himself. They will not be apart of the main HMMLR force per se, but as a special operations team that will be sent on missions that a conventional battle would be too dangerous."

 SCO_UPECW_Blow_Things_Out_desc:0 "The SAS agents that we had sent to England have arrived and are busy acclimating to the climate of England and preparing for the raids and operations they will partake in. The first set of missions are simple ones that will disrupt the Collaborators quite a bit. They will infiltrate factories around northern England and plant explosives on them. During these missions, they will also look for any documents or plans from the Collaborator army. However, we have heard reports that German soldiers have been spotted so our agents will need to be extremely stealthy in this mission. After the explosives are completed and files ransacked, they can leave and detonate the explosives. Hopefully, enough of these will put a divot into the Collaborator economy."
 SCO_UPECW_SAS_Coup:0 "Move on Edinburgh!"
 SCO_UPECW_SAS_Coup_desc:0 "It seems in Holyrood that the SNP have started to go back to their old ways and are attempting to block any way for us to interfere in the English Civil War to help HMMLR. After months of preparation, it seems that the time has come for us to enact our plan to secure the idea of unification. Mayne has authorized SAS soldiers and soldiers in the army who are sympathetic to us to help us coup the government fully and place Mayne in control, this would help us make our mission easier. We have marked locations that we need to control for this coup to succeed. These include the parliament building and the president's residence."

We have gotten more requests from the main body of HMMLR to once again, send more soldiers from Scotland into England to help them fight against the traitors. Our forces that we have sent so far have fought valiantly against the menace of the Collaborators and they will not be forgotten for this. However duty calls and we must send soldiers to fight for our freedom and the dream of a United Kingdom once again. Now we can bring the fight truly.

This is our greatest achievement as an independent country and this shall usher in British Reunification faster than ever.

We must not let a defeat as dark as this to ever happen again. However, we must learn from our mistakes and attempt to learn from them to ensure a defeat as great as this never happens again."

It may seem in our interests to begin talking to the leaders of these English communities and offer them concessions. These will hopefully get more people to join the fight against them.\n\nWe plan to offer the English the prospect that once we have won the war, the government will be run by elected officials. The government will be formed on the same ideals of the Scottish one. Upholding democracy and liberty. This should work, right? "
 SCO_English_Invasion_Arise_For_England_desc:0 "Many of these English people that live in Scotland are still patriotic for England however. While this may have caused an issue in the past, we can begin to recruit English soldiers on a large scale to help us fight back the incoming storm of invaders. These divisions will be primarily composed of English soldiers with English officers. Unlike what we may have done in the past, they will have no oversight by Scottish commanders.

Many of these men had grown up hearing stories of great Scottish soldiers during the two world wars, protecting Scotland oceans away.

As much as we wish this never occurred, it has with England coming knocking on our front door.\n\nWe must defend Scotland, so arise men of Scotland. In Defens! "

While it may be seen as unpopular it is what must be done if we intend to see Scotland survive in this bitter world. Along with this, we have begun to plan out an even bigger recruitment drive to foster even more interest.

It's time we start procuring weaponry from other sources, such as museums, rifle and hunting clubs, and civilian arsenals across the country.\n\nThat's not to say we'll be completely ridiculous. We won't send our men into combat with muskets. But is an assault rifle really necessary for guard duty at a base so far from the front? Of course not. We can't give everyone the best, so we'll limit them to what they need."

 SCO_FEN_ILP_Victory_our_duties_at_home_desc:0 "A government's first responsibility is towards the wellbeing of its citizens. All else is secondary. External issues do exist, but before we deal with them, we must make absolutely sure that we are doing all we can for our people in domestic affairs.\n\nIf our people are unhappy, there is no foreign solution for that. And we would be fools to try and look for one. But if the people of Scotland are content and pleased with the domestic situation, it will free us up to concentrate fully on foreign affairs. Thus, we need to stand on secure domestic standing first."

From there, we'll be able to keep formal and organized contacts with the new English government, and our countrymen living in England will have a stable administrative structure to help them should they incur into any trouble.\n\nWithout further ado, it's time to send the formal request to London's government. The question of whether they'll accept or not is mostly rhetorical, of course, but there are formalities we need to respect in situations such as this..."

Of course, the newly-freed country will need ample economic help to rebuild and recover from twenty years of embargo and a civil war, and we're here to help!\n\nBy proposing several trade treaties to the English government, we'll both greatly benefit from the renewed trade, and this will also help overcome the years of tension which plagued our recent history."

This is an immediate security risk, we need to call a war council meeting to discuss this outcome. Our response will reflect on Scotland for the coming years. Our army has started to get paranoid with a now hostile state on the border that could possibly be looking to take Scotland over next. We need to talk to the generals of the army and see how we can avoid an attack and at the same time, increase our defenses."

Our advisors are telling us to start to move the refugees inland and away from the border. There is a lot of land and open houses in the north that we can start to send the refugees to. There's a fear that if the Collaborators attack us, some of the refugees may side with the invaders and cause lots of trouble for us. We would need to do this fast before the Collaborators get any ideas."
 SCO_classify_aliens:0 "Classify Aliens"
 SCO_classify_aliens_desc:0 "HMMLR was a mess with all of the rebels being grouped into one huge organization. A smart idea for a temporary system but a system that could have large problems down the line for a country. It was filled with the remnants of BUF, socialists, conservatives, liberals, and militarists. If we can start to classify the refugees and former resistance members that cross the border it can help us identify who could be causing the most problems for us and we can specify if they are needed to be under surveillance. Maybe some of the less radical ones can even help us."

 SCO_watch_the_border_desc:0 "With the current moving of refugees away from the borders, some may be a bit reluctant to move, we can influence them to move with a buildup of troops. However, we have ordered the military to the border for another reason. They have come to the border to be on watch 24/7, we now have a hostile state. Our forces have been ordered to dig in and prepare for a possible attack. Our Air Force has been alerted and has been flying surveillance flights near the border to try and see what the Anglos are up to. Our Navy has been ordered as well to patrol the waters."
 SCO_increased_vigilance:0 "Increased Vigilance"
 SCO_increased_vigilance_desc:0 "With our military presence on the border expanded, we can also increase our patrols. We have started to deploy helicopters to patrol the border faster and more efficiently than ground forces. We have also deployed ground patrols though, to cover ground that is harder for helicopters to see. The patrol teams will be made up of a few men each and will cover a bit of the border each day. If anything suspicious is found, they are supposed to radio into command immediately to report it. It is of the most utmost importance that command knows of the situation on the borders."

The OFN can't help us unless they want to anger the Germans, and our army may not be able to hold off the onslaught of an English army supported by the Germans in Cornwall. Our forces are on the border and primed for an invasion. The refugees have been moved out of danger and hopefully away from a potential invasion in case they get turned against us. We will prevail however, our army will holdfast against the fascist threat in The South no matter the cost."

 SCO_embargo_on_english_goods_desc:0 "Recent policy has been brought up on the floors of the Scottish Parliament. It is the issue of English trade. The parliament seems to be split between the SNP and ILP as usual. The SNP is more willing to develop trade with England as long as peace stays the same and there are no hostile relations between the two countries. The ILP, on the other hand, are opposed to this, worrying about the Collaborators taking advantage of this and are open to the idea of an embargo on England. While this may anger them, it may help us out in the long run and help us keep the current peace."
 SCO_increase_defence_budget:0 "Necessary Spendings"
 SCO_increase_defence_budget_desc:0 "Now with the Germans and English on our border, it may be time to increase our budget for the military. We have constantly been asked by our generals before this event if we are going to increase our defense budget. It is a perfect time. We have called our chiefs of staff to discuss this along with some of the generals and admirals in the armed forces to inform us about this revelation. As long as we have advisors we can start to increase it slowly in some core areas. We are partial to increasing our budget especially on defense such as machine guns and trenches."

Our engineers have listed some locations that could use forts to help us defend against a possible invasion. They will be laid out across the border in a defensive line, but unlike the Maginot Line, the invaders cannot go around it unless they want to fight an uphill battle against the Scottish shoreline. We have also approved anti-air defenses to be placed in the forts as well and some near important cities such as Edinburgh and Glasgow and some even in Scapa Flow in case attacking jets slip past us."

 SCO_mobilize_the_people_desc:0 "We should start to mobilize the people with radio addresses by our president. This should hopefully install a sense of importance that we would need to hold the line and defend Scotland. We have started sending officials from the government to start collecting scrap metal to be recycled in the factories. War bonds have also been discussed but are still in the planning stage. The largest motivator is the Civilian Infrastructure Corps.\n\nThis group has been established in the hope of helping the army engineers build the many forts across the border. This has also made lots of new jobs for us. For Scotland!"

We have already expressed interest in an increased border force and lockdown so we can start by doing that, this will hopefully appease them a decent bit. We can also handle our refugee policy better to make it seem that we are on a neutral side. Not helping the former members of the resistance should surely help us out."

While they may not all be radicals or extremely violent it may be in our best interests diplomatically wise to do this to appease the Collaborators. Due to our fillings, we do have lists of these people. We will send out the armed forces and police to arrest these people who we have marked as socialists. Most of them will be arranged to be in jail on random crimes to keep them out of the public eye."

Our chiefs of staff and diplomats have been in contact with the Collaborators discussing terms of returning refugees. We have agreed to their terms and we can start to hand back the refugees.

We can get them back onto our side by making some purchases to help them. It seems that we could need some new firearms and some other equipment such as machine guns. Our armored divisions have been asking for new maintenance equipment for a while, maybe it's time that we supply their needs. This should keep them compliant."

So are rumors of us killing refugees who had been classified as socialists. The media hasn't been helping our cause with some stations criticizing our actions recently saying that we had bowed to them. We need to make an announcement that outlines that we did not do any of these things and through expert negotiations, peace has been achieved for the foreseeable future. This should surely calm down the public and make our opinion rise, maybe some will even enlist in the armed forces."

 SCO_use_hmmlr_remnants_desc:0 "We have announced that the army will start to be recruiting former members of HMMLR in the armed forces if they want to. We have two purposes for this. The first is intelligence and having more skilled soldiers. Some of them may remember the tactics of the English Army and their German allies. Some of the soldiers in the resistance had been trained under David Stirling or Claude Auchinleck, they would make good soldiers. The other is a morale booster to the many refugees who have fled to the safety of Scotland after the war. Hopefully, they realize that the fight against the Collaborators isn't close to done."

 SCO_refugees_for_public_works_desc:0 "Many of the refugees are skilled in terms of labor. A decent group knows how to use heavy machinery and work in factories. The ones that haven't found jobs already we can start to train for a construction corp. This group would assist the many engineer groups across Scotland to help construct road systems and railways. They can also assist in the construction of forts across the Anglo-Scottish border. The more help we get the better in being prepared in-case the English cross the border with the Germans looking for blood. We could also even offer incentives to hopefully get more people to enlist to help."

They could pose a dangerous threat unless they have been taken care of. While the country is mostly stable and under control, they could destabilize it quickly and we have received reports of police being called to break up fights between the former members of the BUF and members of the main army of HMMLR. We should start to arrest them on charges of "Danger to the State". This should make the country much more stable for the foreseeable future."

 SCO_organize_refugees_brigades_desc:0 "After meetings with officers who had escaped the Collaborators in the south, we have agreed to make English brigades. These brigades will be mostly English soldiers and some Scottish and English officers to help lead and command. There has been some tension between the former members of the Left Resistance and the members of the Scottish Army and it seems that this was the best way to relieve these tensions. These brigades will operate in the same capacity as the Scottish ones. This should hopefully make our Army more effective in general. Some of the former members of the resistance are too good to leave to waste."

Our country isn't burning down around us or getting attacked, we are only between a rock and a hard place. We will move on from this, however.

There are two fields that we have been looking at. One is the school of defense. This would primarily help us defend Scotland if an attacker comes to us and we are pushed back.

We can use this to our advantage heavily in case the Anglos get bold enough to cross the border and try to take Scotland. Scotland herself is naturally defensible, our border may be short, but we can increase our border security with checks and fortifications across the border to make any attack a living hell to foreign invaders. Our border crossings will start to include heavier firepower to ward off any attacker. The many hills across Scotland will help us greatly to serve as cover for men and armor. Scotland will stand free."

 SCO.1.t:0 "Scottish Paranoia"
 SCO.1.desc:0 "Scotland is a democracy in a precarious situation. Though free, there is always the threat of the German malice crashing down on us. This is what the Scottish Armed Forces is constantly fearing. Since the onslaught was stopped at the border and Scotland became independent our generals have been worrying about a German invasion. They want to be prepared.\n\nThe commander of the Armed Forces, Field Marshal Douglas Wimberley, has inherited this paranoid stance from the former British army. He thinks the Wehrmacht might strike any second and wants to apply this on every soldier. He wants the Armed Force to be in an unbelievable state of complete built-up, always ready and a force to be reckoned with.\n\nAs long as Germany exists that may prove to be a grave problem for the government. If they let Wimberley roam freely, he might consider fateful mistakes with his urge to overspend. Should the paranoia spread the government will have a hard time with the military, which increasingly thinks the ruling party is working against Scotland and for Germany.\n\nThey cannot allow the Armed Forces to reach a certain point in their fear where it might get dangerous. Thus, the government must toe the line. The Armed Forces must be reformed, but they might take this seriously ill and retaliate. Treading carefully is the way to go."
 SCO.1.a:0 "Does fortune really favor the bold?"
 SCO.2.t:0 "Paranoia removed"
 SCO.2.desc:0 "To our surprise the armed forces have begun to step down their more overt opposition to the policies of this government. It would seem, to our own surprise, that they have done so without our prompting is all the more unusual.\n\nGiven the unfortunate history between us and the more proactive elements of the military this comes as a very good piece of news indeed. For all that the paranoia of our Armed Forces regarding potential German action against our isle it has occasionally gotten in the way of ordinary civilian governance. Now that we can apparently marshal their loyalty of our own accord it will allow Scotland to begin acting in a manner befitting a modern nation state.\n\nOf course it would do well for us to remember that their paranoia was not unfounded, a careful eye on the Reich couldn't hurt after all."
 SCO.2.a:0 "A good thing indeed."
 SCO.3.t:0 "New Scottish Navy"
 SCO.3.desc:0 "Scapa Flow is one of the world's greatest natural harbours. Norsemen, Scotsmen, Englishmen, all have taken advantage of its deep waters - and currently, the Scottish fleet is the greatest in the Isles. The New Scots Navy, founded with the collapse of the Empire and the mutiny of large sections of the old Royal Navy at the prospect of German rule. Operation Trebuchet, a collaboration between British, American and Commonwealth forces, provided support for large sections of the Royal Navy to defect to Scotland. Many of these ships had indeed been built in the great shipyards on the river Clyde, and Scotland provided a home for the British refugees who had crewed them. Our navy is built around supporting the great carriers of the Empire - NSS Furious, NSS Victorious, and NSS Indomitable. They are supplemented by an array of cruisers, destroyers and submarines - many constructed by the friendly state of Ulster.\n\nBelfast's shipyards are some of the largest in Britain, and while they may not be capable of supporting a large navy of their own they are more than happy to accept our support on the seas. Friends on the British Isles are hard to come by, and we have supported each other through the troubled times of both German and Irish invasion. We can only hope that we will not have need of this navy."

They are on highest alert for what they think is an imminent German invasion thanks to the developments in Germany. They are rushing the countryside to be always prepared for this supposed invasion. They are even calling the government out to be infested with German spies that try to lure the ruling party into letting Germany invade.\n\nThe commander of the Armed Forces is throwing his budget recklessly into seemingly never-ending holes. He doesn't listen to them and does whatever he wants. Building, spending and conducting without any legal permission. Utterly dumb decision follow stupid decisions.\n\nThe next months will be hell for the government to deal with such unreasonable fellows."
 SCO.60.a:0 "Bloddy Hell!"
 SCO.61.t:0 "Low Paranoia"
 SCO.61.desc:0 "The last months have shown a pleasant development. The Scottish Armed Forces are calming down due to the development in Germany's sphere. They are less and less convinced that Germany may deal the fatal strike. Nearly nobody in the Armed Forces believes that the government could be considered pro-German. The concern has sunk and the stress on the government has dropped.\n\nThe Field Marshal has ceased any mischievous attempts that hamper Scotland. They spend their budget rationally and conduct army exercises at a less regular state. He even takes the government's advise and has found common ground with them. This means that peace has settled in for now.\n\nThe next months will thus be relaxing and finally quite normal."

Under his rule, however, England collapsed into civil war with the Resistance, yearning for a liberated England.\n\nWhile Garrison and collaborationist forces have been executing the last Resistance forces, a joint statement by the Garrison leader and Powell was released to denounce this revolution as a farce. Now Edward VIII, the Satan he is, and the Garrison stand firm as the representation of German will in England. The German behemoth has been reinforced on the Isles.\n\nDouglas Wimberley has instantly ordered the increase of the already enhanced military action in Scotland. The general staff is in chaos and drags the government in stressful months to come. The worries all over Scotland increase in fear of a reformed United Kingdom under the Swastika that might claim its allegedly "lost" territories."

The Resistance's leading figures proclaimed the liberation of England. Soon we might see the next democracy arise on the Isles next to ours. This is a delightful thought and happens to be at the right time. The Isles are freed of the Nazis for now.\n\nOur Armed Force's intensification on the border is slowly retreating back to a normal state. The generals are easing down, which in turn gives the government again time to slacken. Nobody is entirely pleased, however, as it is still uncertain what Free England's future actions will involve.

He longed for anything that broke the monotony, so he jumped at the chance to go on a secret mission with a column of tanks.\n\nHis excitement turned to worry as he got closer and closer to the Scottish border. His worry turned to horror as the column passed over the border and into England. This was the war, he was sure of it. And the English would attack them any minute. But they didn't. The civil war had fortunately curtailed the response times of the English border guards, apparently.\n\nAfter a few miles on the English road came another strange order. The tanks arrived at a grassy field and the crews were ordered to dismount. Tanker trucks came alongside to top the vehicles off. Then, the crews were instructed to abandon the tanks and board several trucks for the trip home.\n\nNone of this made any sense to MacKenzie. Why go into England? Why abandon a bunch of tanks there? And why fuel them up fully before leaving? He desperately wanted to talk to people about it, but they told him not to.

These trucks have been carrying standard issue rifles of varying age and make, from state of the art (by Scottish standards) to old ww2 weaponry that some of our older men used in the invasion of the United Kingdom. These arms will certainly come in handy for our fight against the collaborationist bastards, however it may come at a cost.

The technology currently employed by the SAF is, by modern air-force standards around the world, archaic and in need of severe improvement. Furthermore, the size of the SAF poses an issue as well - should war break out, even if the entire SAF was overhauled and modernized, we would likely see the SAF fail to achieve parity with an invading force simply due to the magnitude (or lack of) of the air wings.

Furthermore, this report shall cover the overall modernization shortfalls and opportunities of the NSN.\n\nPage 348/350\n\nConclusions: \nThe NSN is one of the most powerful fleets in the Atlantic, falling short of the Kriegsmarine as well as the US Navy, but remains one of the most outdated fleets across the globe. While there is no need to decommission any flotillas, as we are within our naval capacity, there is a clear difference in technology used by the NSN and other modernised navies throughout the world. Thus, we as the SMRA Committee have arrived at the conclusion that much work must be done to bring the NSN to a place where it may pose a considerable threat to even the navies that supersede the size and scope of our own. This will require a budgetary increase for the NSN, particularly in the realm of acquiring new technologies and going through the operations of refitting our current ships with said technologies.

These men know the art they seek to apply. The trick with violence in interrogations is to keep it as small in scale and limited in extent as possible, else the subject will grow to used to the pain. Interspersing the relief with fresh pain when the suspect thinks it to all be over ought to break even the hardiest of men after all."

 SCO.266.t:0 "Just Questions"
 SCO.266.desc:0 "Violence is a crude tool, one resorted to by people who are unaware of their own thuggish nature. In the modern era there are so many ways to get someone to talk that do not involve laying so much as a finger on them. A jug of water, just out of reach. The smell of freshly cooked food wafting through a door. Offers of amnesty if a suspect should give up their co conspirators.\n\nThere is always a less graphic solution, and all the interrogators need to do is find the one that fits just right in the mind of the suspect. Perhaps it will simply be time in a cell that loosens their lips, or mayhaps the promise of speaking to their loved ones? Little by little their will to remain silent shall be eroded and then? We shall have some answers at long last."
 SCO.266.a:0 "This ought to work."
 SCO.267.t:0 "Revelations"
 SCO.267.desc:0 "To hear our suspects tell it they were only involved in the most tangential of ways with what are not riots, but coordinated and organized attacks on the English speaking refugees of the border regions. Using the cover of riots by stoking legitimate grievances to a boiling point, these covert groups use the violence as a cover for their own purposes.\n\nThat criminal elements would be so bold is worrisome but compounding the issue is that to some degree they must have had assistance from law enforcement at the local level. Naturally this is intolerable but it throws a rather sizeable wrench into plans of a short and swift investigation, this is not something that can simply be brushed over after all. Still we have answers, but we are still somewhat short in the department of guaranteed names and faces. This investigation shall power on ahead regardless."
 SCO.267.a:0 "This is... disturbing."
 SCO.268.t:0 "A Humane Isue"
 SCO.268.desc:0 "Human trafficking. The violence was all a cover for a massive human trafficking organisation looking to scrape up more victims. That such a vile practice could be taking place upon the shores of Scotland at this very moment is undeniably a horrifying thought but more poignantly it is refugees, mostly young women and girls, being targeted in this atrocity being sent to destinations unknown.\n\nThat such an abomination has slipped the notice of the relevant authorities for so long only heightens the flaws in our approach up until this point, no longer can we afford to treat this like any normal investigation. It has become a matter of national interest to this brought not simply to a close but to a satisfactory conclusion in regards to the detention of those responsible for this horror. Investigate every lead, question every source, but we must find answers and fast."
 SCO.268.a:0 "Well this is not good at all."
 SCO.269.t:0 "Uncomfortable Truths"
 SCO.269.desc:0 "Human trafficking is a barbaric practice usually confined to the darker and less civilised parts of the world. That it is happening in Scotland in the modern age is something to which the government can only respond with an emotion slightly more drastic than mere concern. To this end, the investigation has been given more funds to better solve the mystery of whom, when and why the operation got started in the first place.\n\nMore funds, perhaps naturally, means nigh unlimited funding for the near future at least. A scandal like this could break a government if handled wrong and the incumbent is no exception to this. The government thus has but three demands. Find everyone even tangentially conected to this incident regardless of status or birth, find them swiftly and bring them in alive. A swift trial will need to be conducted after all."

 SCO.270.t:0 "Leads"
 SCO.270.desc:0 "Thus far our suspects have indicated a variety of leads that incriminate figures in the trafficking ring, but little good has come of it. Nonetheless it is imperative that this investigation searches and identifies every potential lead lest something slip through our fingers, even if in this case the lead is naught but a small row of warehouses of a port town. Oddly our suspects seemed very insistent that we would want to see whatever is going on at this location so it is being investigated, but our hopes are not high. Perhaps if we are lucky we may be able to recover some clues like a shipping manifest.\n\nOur teams are about to go in, all they need before engaging the operation is the go ahead. Shall we go forth, or are we going to refocus our efforts on a, perhaps more reliable, lead?"
 SCO.270.a:0 "Worth a shot. Do it."
 SCO.271.t:0 "One last Warehouse"
 SCO.271.desc:0 "In all honesty what the investigative teams have reported thus far is rather... unexciting. To be sure there are some minor links to the attacks, leaflets and other such propaganda, but nothing overt and certainly nothing worth bringing people in over. Some contraband as well but in what warehouse would that not be found?\n\nStill there is yet one warehouse remaining, a stunted little thing owned by some minor contractors. In all honesty it is probably not worth the effort but orders are orders and when the upper ranks order every warehouse to be searched then by god not a stone shall be left unturned. Though technically the final say on the matter does lie with the ranking official in the room, so the question becomes will the order to enter it be given?"
 SCO.271.a:0 "Eh why not?"
 SCO.272.t:0 "A Gruesome Discovery"
 SCO.272.desc:0 "The warehouse was normal at first, to be expected one supposes since if it had been notable in any way it would have been searched long before the current time. Some crates containing old supplies, a loading dock for the lorries which would come in an out and a small office off to the side for the manager.\n\nIndeed at first the search crew found nothing whatsoever, it was not until the officer in charge noted the scuff marks on one on the wooden panels lining the interior that anything was deemed amiss. It took three men to break down the wall, and a further five to lever the trapdoor behind it open. At first it looked as ordinary a basement as one might expect, right until the men noticed what is was that littered the floors."
 SCO.272.a:0 "Oh... oh dear this is not good."
 SCO.273.t:0 "Laid to Rest"
 SCO.273.desc:0 "Pistols rifles and grenades by the dozen litter the basement tables crates, many of them recently used and many more just waiting their turn. It is obvious to the officer in charge that at least some of the weapons will turn up matches to the ones suspected for the incidents taking place in recent times.\n\nMore shockingly though are the bodies, forensic analysis and comparisons to recent missing persons reports will determine that the only thing the three dozen corpses had in common was their English background. They'd been shot in the head recently too, but by whom it was initially unclear. Right up until the discovery of a second shipment of guns not two weeks later. The half criminal syndicate half nationalist hate group responsible would be arrested one and all, but the tragedy would stain Scotland for many years to come. Both in the response of law enforcement to illegal weapons, and of the people to hatreds that had once festered. Perhaps in the end a peace could be found."

 SCO.274.t:0 "Investigation"
 SCO.274.desc:0 "An investigation... would be too costly to undertake at the present time. Citizens having squabbles are a common problem and it simply is not the place of this government to intervene so hastily in what is undeniably a delicate matter.\n\nThis is of course not even accounting for the undeniable monetary costs and the potential political costs of wherever blame would have to be pointed, far better to simply wait the clashes out.\n\nYet there are some who decry this as not only cowardice but foolishness, and proclaim that if the public become aware off out deliberate inaction in regards to the clashes they may well take out their anger upon us. This is pure nonsense of course but some of our officials are wondering if this is truly the best choice."
 SCO.274.a:0 "A government of stability is what is required at this time and we shall provide it."
 SCO.275.t:0 "Expected Outcome"
 SCO.275.desc:0 "Our efforts to keep the government afloat by steadying through the crisis are... well, failing. Without being able to identify the key causes of the violence all our actions to respond to it have thus far been sadly lacking in effectiveness. The Scottish persons involved are usually angry at us for the poor conditions they face, and the English rarely have a different opinion stubborn as they are.\n\nThe discontent is yet to reach a boiling point but alas it is becoming noticeable, more and more protests are starting to appear in the streets both organized and spontaneous, on top of which we still do not have any clear idea as to what is causing the discontent in the first place. Things are to say the least, looking grim."
 SCO.275.a:0 "That... could have gone better."
 SCO.276.t:0 "English Hatred"
 SCO.276.desc:0 "Our recent action, or perhaps lack thereof has caused considerable resentment in the English community of Scotland, the perception of government indifference turning what was mere dislike into outright hatred amongst some of the more vocal sections of the populace. Accusations of abandonment and even collaboration with those committing acts of violence against English communities run rife, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep Scotland's largest minority cooperative.\n\nStill, at least things have not gone as poorly as some feared. For all that the English grumble they have yet to embrace the mass civil disobedience or worse, armed resistance that some of the more eccentric figures assert are just around the corner."
 SCO.276.a:0 "Well at least we still have our health."
 SCO.277.t:0 "Think of Something"
 SCO.277.desc:0 "Why do some people just not get it? The reason for the lack of an investigation is that there is little to investigate properly. Yet despite our wisdom in not jumping to hasty conclusion elements of the population, especially the English sections thereof, have begun to voice their discontent in far more public fashion than before. Namely, riots.\n\nUnrest is not at the point of mass violence or worse revolution, but never before has Scotland seen such a discontent amongst its people that did not lead to one of those two endpoints. It would seem that the public must be placated to some degree, but the question on the minds of those concerned in government is how this could be done without an investigation? Something to think on at any rate. Before we all end up at the mercy of the rioters."
 SCO.277.a:0 "Oh dear this isn't good."
 SCO.278.t:0 "Division"
 SCO.278.desc:0 "Internal divisions are always awkward matters, and unfortunately the recent public outcry over our chosen course of action in regards to the recent violence has caused such a division to appear amongst those elements of the government that sought to address matters more directly. In response to even more violent incidents this factions of the government has put forth a proposal that, even though an investigation might be out of the question, some relief should be given to those who have lost loved ones in the violence, monetary relief at the very least but also temporary housing for those left without dwellings.\n\nThis might be a controversial move with the main arm of the government but even so there are those who admit it might be best to just get it over with. Still, we must decide one way or the other."
 SCO.278.a:0 "Seems a bit too expensive to be realistic."

 SCO.279.t:0 "Law and Order"
 SCO.279.desc:0 "Contrary to the beliefs of the imbeciles who suggest our inaction has somehow caused the present situation, the government is quite confident that the momentary issues brought about by rioting in some minority communities shall remain just so, momentary and not worth the attention of the state. It is not the business of the government to interfere in the internal affairs of a community and to suggest such is a folly of the highest order.\n\nThe government shall maintain a calm and dedicated approach towards this issue as it has done towards all previous and shall maintain against all future disruptions to the public good. Those who seek to take advantage of the situation shall be dealt with as need be by law enforcement personnel."

Clergy and communists, Englishmen and Scots, rich and poor, old and young.\n\nFor the most part these consisted of nothing more than circling government buildings and politicians residences, but the message was clear. The public are unhappy with how this matter has been handled, and the lack of action on part of the government only contributed to make a bad situation worse. It will not be easy to regain the trust of the public after a failure of this magnitude."

Regardless of our intentions it is an unfortunate reality that things have not turned out for the best. Distrust between the English and the rest of Scotland is at a low, and the trust of the English hold in regards to ourselves could be best referred to as nonexistent.\n\nStill we can make things right, a significant amount of money is being collected to compensate those who have lost homes or loved ones in the violence, as well as to apologise for our lack of action earlier where it might have counted."

More generally the country as a whole is returning to normalcy as a sense of calm pervades the political atmosphere.\n\nYet... even amongst our supporters there are those who think we should have acted sooner and done more in regards to fixing the problem instead of dithering for as long as we did.

So now, I see a lot less about Jacobitism, and a lot more about the economic and political opportunities that Scotland gained by joining up."\n\n"That's right. New guidelines came down. The government wants the students to learn that not all of what England did was inherently awful, and that the UK actually did a bunch of good things for Scotland."\n\n"And going back, they start talking about how the Scottish clans fighting each other was reason Enough for the English to put an end to them. The English romanticising the highlands during the Victorian era. And how the Scottish emigration was more due to government subsidies to settle the colonies than the English messing up the Economy. This is far different than what my last class was told."\n\n"I guess that the ILP wants the kids to have a better view of England than the SNP would want them to." Barr sighed.

The city has provided police protection, a parade route, and a park to host the event, complete with music, food, and alcohol being served in designated areas. Many people from all over the town have come, including many local ILP politicians.\n\nThis change is one of the most visible of the ILP's newfound focus on English cultural sensitivity.

Maybe even some of them have been sent here by the Collaborators in London trying to influence Scotland and affect us in ways we haven't seen before.

While he cited age related reasons for this decision, those familiar with the current state in Scotland might adduce another factor: Wimberley's sudden satisfaction with the government. Either way, Wimberley has earned to live his last years with his family as he sees fit, without the stress of recent years.\n\nBorn in 1896 Douglas Wimberley took part in the First World War, famously in the Battle of Passchendaele. He was rewarded many decorations and served in the expeditionary force of the Entente to the Russian Civil War. He attended staff college with famous figures like Bernard Montgomery and Harold Alexander, served in Pakistan and, in 1939, was part of the British force fighting in France. The war then led him from France to northern Africa, and finally all the way back to the Scottish border where the German onslaught of Operation Sea Lion could be stopped.\n\nSince the end of the Second World War, the Field Marshal was always weary of what he thought to be an impending German invasion. He greatly popularized the idea of paranoia-ridden Armed Forces, always ready for everything. Subsequently, this granted many headbutts with the government, whose actions he often despised as too reluctant.\n\nIn recent times, however, he became increasingly pleased with the actions the government undertook to apparently ensure Scotland's defense. Thus, many suggest this turn in governing was the true catalyst for Wimberley to antedate his retirement.

He was rewarded many decorations and served in the expeditionary force of the Entente to the Russian Civil War. In 1921 he was part of the Irish War of Independence. He attended staff college with famous figures like Bernard Montgomery and Harold Alexander, served in Pakistan and, in 1939, was part of the British force fighting in France. The war then led him from France to North Africa and finally all the way back to the Scottish border where the German onslaught of Operation Sea Lion could be stopped.\n\nIn the last decade after the war the Field Marshal became head of the Scottish Armed Forces, greatly favoring an Armed Force paranoid of a German invasion. This subsequently gave the governments many headaches and headbutts with disobedient and fearful Armed Forces.\n\nNow, that the catalyst for all this is gone, the Armed Forces have a moment to calm down and the government must decide the next pick to take Wimberley's place.\n\nIn this they must tread carefully."

They must be careful with the next commander as an Armed Force driven by paranoia might severely backfire for the government. The ruling party is presented with four fateful choices.\n\nGeneral David Young joined the Royal Scots in 1945, shortly before the end of the British demise in the Second World War. He was selected Commanding Officer of the Royal Scots some years ago. Thereafter, just a few years prior, he was appointed commander of a Mechanized Brigade. His selection would slightly favor anti-paranoia. If he was to become Commander of the Armed Forces, spending would strongly represent Young's preference of mechanized and motorized divisions as well.\n\nNext up is Lieutenant General Alexander Boswell who was commissioned to the Highlanders after military academy education in 1948, working his way up to being appointed second-in-command. Some time prior he became commander of an armored division. His selection would be an enforced continuation of the Field Marshal's policy of a paranoia ridden Armed Forces. Besides, Boswell would greatly boost the expansion of the armored branch of the Armed Forces.\n\nAnother potential pick would be Air Marshal Thomas Kennedy. Joining the Air Force in 1946 he was sequentially picked for officer training. He rose quickly through the ranks. Commanding his own squadron he rose up to one of the highest Air Force ranks a few years ago. Picking him would greatly reduce the Armed Forces' paranoia. Additionally, the Air Marshal would logically put his efforts into expanding the Air Force of the Armed Forces.\n\nLast but not least we are presented with Admiral Andrew Miller. Joining the Royal Navy in the last year of British humiliation in 1944 he oversaw the end of the war and joined the Scottish Navy in the ensuing time. Having been given command of several ships he quickly climbed up the career ladder, becoming Admiral recently. Favoring him would minorly continue Wimberley's policy. He would, of course, also prioritize the Navy's expansion, focusing on small ship warfare."

The announcement in national broadcast was only formal as most of the country had already suspected the meaning of the military presence.\n\nFor quite some time the Field Marshal of the Scottish Armed Forces, maniacally weary of an allegedly impending German invasion, was more than discontent with the government's supposed mischievous inaction. Now he took the reins of fortune in his own two hands to counter his worst fear of the German invasion, which he extensively argued about in the broadcast.\n\nNow a new government is in the build-up, and it will either be the direct or indirect manifestation of the Scottish Armed Forces having complete control of Scotland from now on."

This sublimely prepared site will be place for a day of celebration and tomorrow will act as the place for the first reenactment of the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\nDuring the Scottish interregnum in 1291 Edward I of England was declared Lord Paramount of Scotland in his deceitful arbitration. This Plantagenet having been declared the next king of Scotland this King immediately started working against Edward I. This led to the first War of Scottish Independence, lasting from 1296-1328.\n\nAt first Edward, "Hammer of the Scots", defeated us in battle after battle. By 1304 Scotland was brought to its knees by near total conquest. In 1306 the famous Robert de Bruce seized the Scottish throne and started a relentless guerilla campaign against the English. Edward I's death and the incapability of his son, later infamous for his downfall at the hands of his own wife, contributed to the reemergence of Scotland.\n\nWanting to relieve the siege of Stirling Castle Edward II prepared for the famous battle.

Plenty of people said this was the wrong way to do things, but that way of doing things put her far up in the chain of command, to the point she was now secretary to Field Marshal Wimberley. So when she got a message that was marked urgent, she was going to deliver that message posthaste.\n\nThe problem was she had no idea where Marshal Wimberley actually was. He had mentioned something about a meeting yesterday, and hadn't shown up today. It sounded important, but how important was it really? It was peacetime, and it couldn't be as critical as the message she had to deliver.\n\nOne of the other secretaries had mentioned her boss having some sort of meeting in the basement. Perhaps that's where he was. It was worth it to check it out, Effie thought as she descended the staircase to the long corridor in the basement. The meeting would be in a room that had been mostly used by the maintenance staff, but the military sometimes used for secret conferences.\n\nAs she approached, she heard muffled voices, unintelligible. She heard a few words, but couldn't assign much significance to them. She also heard a few of the voices. Some seemed to have an accent that was a little more southern than the ones she usually heard, but she didn't take notice. What did get her notice was the voice of Marshall Wimberley.\n\nOpening the door, she started "Marshal, it's from Washington..."\n\n...and noticed Wimberley and several other Scottish officers. Some she recognized. But she didn't recognize the others in attendance. Some were in civilian clothes. A few had on berets with a red star. And one even wore the shirt of an officer in collaborationist England.\n\nAnd she noticed a map of Britain on the table, with markings all around England and the Scottish border region. And on the maps were words like "drop zones," "safehouses," and "supply routes." But one unusual word stuck out. All over the map, and in all capital: "HMMLR.""

The first iteration of the division was not much better, having been betrayed and abandoned in France and left in a German prison camp. But I knew we had the basics to make the best unit in the British Army. We were going to train hard, wear kilts whenever we could and only have saxons in the unit when absolutely necessary! When the huns came, they didn't face the reserve division they expected. And they paid for it.\n\nEven at the end of the war, when the Nazis stood astride the isles, we were the ones who made sure they didn't advance further. And we stood there ever since.

Papers had not been difficult to forge and he had quickly risen through the ranks to be where he was now - in a position of significant power.

I have connections with the local police as well as within the Scottish Army - sympathetic connections, I should say. And while both sides owe me favors, it'd be a bad idea, quite frankly, to use all of them at the same time. Not just because we might need them in the future, but because if we decided to go ahead and have both the army pull back as well as have police officers reassigned, that would be too obvious. Surely, you understand that."\n\nAbram nodded, and Barrow continued. "So here's my solution - I could either work to have the army be pulled back far away from the city. This arguably might be more difficult, due to the amount of strings needing pulling, but it can be done. The other option we have is that I can use my contacts in the police as well as the Justice department to get police reassigned to other cities, leaving less of them to respond in the case of a move by us.

Therefore, I move that we change the overall goal of this committee, as we can use the resources available to us to achieve a better goal than the investigation of a few middle-aged men."\n\nAfter a few hours of deliberation, the committee had arrived at two proposals - both of which, Logan thought, could only benefit the operations the SAS had planned.

"Our idea is twofold - we can only pursue one course of action, so we must think hard on which course of action to take. If it turns out that we took the wrong one, the operation could be over before it even starts and all of you, as well as your men, will be exposed and likely prosecuted for treason." Heads nodded around the room.\n\nLogan Bain spoke, "So what are the options you have arrived at?"\n\nAbram jumped at the question. "Essentially, there are two ways we can essentially sabotage the road system. One is more direct, another more... political. The political option is, using all of our contacts as well as the pull that the SAS has with the current government, we can push for the ceasement of all road building to and from Edinburgh. While this would leave many avenues still open for movement, it keeps it relatively controllable." He pointed at the main roads to the capital city.

"The danger, of course, is that by implanting SAS men into the ministry, we run two risks. One, the men could be found out and interrogated. Even if they don't divulge the plans under significant pressure, the mere possibility that they are SAS men could kill the baby in it's crib, so to speak. Two, we lose men that could be on the front lines of keeping the peace and ensuring a peaceful transition. An idea put forward to me by one staff sergeant the other day who's assigned to the defense ministry was this." He leaned forward and clinked Ardis' glass.

The rear hatch opened, and pallets of crates started being moved out of the plane by the people on the ground and the crew of the aircraft. It was a hard job, made somewhat easier by pallet jacks, but it was one accomplished with speed and haste. Once the items were removed, the pilot saluted the ground commander, and then closed the hatch. A few minutes later, the airplane was back in the air.\n\nNow, the commander's job was to see the crates made it to where they needed to go. Lorries were already being filled up as some HMMLR rebels snuffed out the lights beside the road. The officer opened up the hatch of a crate to see if it was there. Yes, it was. Several rifles, and ammunition to go with them. Grenades and machine guns would be in this load as well.\n\nHe wished the crew of the aircraft well as they went back to Scotland. More of these journeys would be undertaken by them, delivering the free English loads of weaponry.

Shaving equipment, toothpaste and brush, comb, handkerchief, socks,pencil and paper, gum, hard candy, and smokes! All courtesy of HMMLR and the Republic of Scotland!" He started tossing them out to the soldiers, saying "one per man, now!"\n\nIt didn't take long before the packages were offloaded by the soldiers, happy to receive the free items. The lorry drove off back to make more deliveries on behalf of the Scottish government. Packages of food would go to HMMLR refugee camps, with special packages for invalids.

 SCO.3108.desc:0 "Dear Sir,\n\nA string of sabotage actions have recently occurred at a number of military factories across our territory. This has caused tremendous trouble to our production efforts and to the supply of new material. These actions are believed to be the work of rebel terrorists, and we are investigating several leads as we speak. However, a discovery has pointed to an unsettling conclusion as to an outside source of aid for these operations.\n\nInvestigations of several of these bombings have found remanents of pencil detonators, physical detonators that light a fuse and give the user time to escape. This is a step-up from previous methods employed by the rebels, where they used simple fuses or lit cigarettes in a matchbook. The possibility they have acquired a stockpile of our own engineering equipment has been discounted, as the English military has been using electric blasting caps since the end of the war.\n\nThe OFN would be a possible source of these detonators, but our intelligence says they prefer blasting caps as well. Our files, however, indicate that production of Number 10 delay switches was shifted up north to Scotland during the Second World War after Operation Sealion. It's extremely likely the Scottish military is continuing to produce the type, or has developed quite a stockpile. And rebel groups have long trespassed into Scottish territory to receive supplies.\n\nThe implication of this evidence is clear. Scotland has given the rebels the means to conduct a sabotage campaign, and may be giving them additional training to accomplish this task as well. We must be wary, and look for any new evidence that will prove Scotland is involved in this."

He remarked that this could disrupt Scotland forever, but this could help them legitimacy wise.\n\n"Have you talked to Marshal Wimberley recently?" John asked this to Robert. Wimberley and McCormick had always had a special relationship. It was the two of them who helped make Scotland the country it was today. Robert asked why and John replied.\n\n"He came to visit me.

His hat was out of place and his uniform had a bit of dirt on the bottoms. He ignored it for the time being. Wimberley then remembered that this was the boy he sent to watch and take note of the current Parliament. The officer walked up to the Marshal, saluted, and handed him the note. Wimberley asked about how the ILP and UP had been doing. The officer said they had been outnumbered by the SNP by just a bit but maybe some of the SNP members could vote for the current bill. Wimberley scoffed and then dismissed the officer. He looked at the letter and laughed to himself. He then handed it to an aide. He asked it to be filed away in one of the many folders he had on the political parties of Scotland. He strolled over to the firing range to watch the recruits try their hand at firing the very weapons that would protect Scotland. He had recently visited his friend, John McCormick. The current president of Scotland. He had ruled the country for nearly 20 years and was deathly sick at the moment. It hurt Wimberley that one of his brothers-in-arms was bed-ridden. He and John formed the country together.\n\nWimberley, however, cleared his mind and walked over to one of the privates on the range.

Like my many other letters that have been received, I am once again asking for financial support. Our men who are willing to put down their lives to protect Scotland from the Collaborator's in the south are training with decade-old equipment. What is a good soldier without a good weapon?

Our future and livelihood depend on the very circumstances of this bill.\n\nGrand Marshal Douglas Wimberley"\n\nThe Prime Minister sighed, this was the second time this month he had received a letter from Wimberley. If there was something Wimberley had, it was a way with words he thought. He tossed the idea of funding around in his head.

As the Leader of the Opposition, he made a speech that announced the funding of the military calling it a gross overreach of rights established by the constitution. He then asked the Leader of the Majority from the SNP to tell him where the funding had been acquired from. The Leader of the Majority didn't answer him, Wolfe was dumbfounded; he wondered if the SNP would bend the knee to the Army so easily. He then walked off the stand after his speaking time was done and Priscilla Buchan walked up. She reiterated many of the same points of the ILP but said that she pledges to use the money from the bill if it fails to help the people of Scotland even more. She got lots of nods and whispers of agreement from the rows of seats. During this speech, Wolfe was paying half-attention and had collected himself. During this, he was considering offering a compromise to the SNP about this bill. He agreed on the facts about the Army. Maybe he could receive a compromise when half the funding is achieved. He reminded his subordinates that the Army's primary defense of Scotland, so this bill would protect them. Some of the ILP members hadn't agreed with this action and had planned to vote to abstain.

They demanded immediate action. Others urged caution, for a variety of reasons. Either motivated by fear of making a wrong move, or guided by a sense or knowledge that most of the nation did not know, they told the nation to wait. And so they did.\n\nEventually, the whispers started thinning out. Slowly at first, but surely. Then, it dramatically declined until only a mumble was left. Perhaps their source stopped. Or perhaps everyone had heard them already and wanted to hear something else. Or something else entirely had happened. But the rumor of the coup was no longer at the peak it was at before.

So it was in the Scottish army.\n\nNobody knew why they were here. Rumors of an exercise, most likely. Some had more wild and extreme theories. These were quickly put to rest by the officers there. The truth was, most of the unit did not know. And they weren't expected to know. Thus, rumors found fertile ground amongst the men, who each had their own theory on what was to happen. But that was how things were normally, and most just went about their day not caring.\n\nFinally early in the morning, they got the order to move out. To where? Not important, just somewhere else. Many just threw their things in the back of a truck and drove off. Only the drivers knew where they would go for sure. Most of the men just left without a word, just wondering what today's orders were. They left their encampments behind as they traveled away.\n\nThree hours later, an armored car smashed through the doors of St. Andrew's House in Edinburgh, the home of the Scottish government."

He had total confidence in his team, but he didn't have it in the brass, and that's why he was shaking his head now\n\nApparently they were to get in under the guise of a 'routine' maintenance company - one that had been pre-designated to update the airport's security measures to 'state-of-the-art'. Abernathy thought it was almost laughable - were he someone who were keeping an airport on lockdown, he'd find it incredibly suspicious that within the few days that their operation had begun, a team of specialists were to arrive declaring that they were there to add additional security measures to the airport.\n\nHe sighed. What's done was done, and this was what had been decided as the best way for them to get in to do their job. There was no going back - even with his misgivings about the idea, he knew it was only a matter of time before their chance to figure out what was happening slipped away.

The guards had at first been on the defensive and were about to detain them until Abernathy began shouting at them that they were about to make him jobless, wifeless, and penniless - even though he had the full authority of the airport to do the work he had been paid to do. At that, the guards had become rather sheepish, but still resistant, until Abernathy pulled out the falsified work order and read through it for about 5 minutes before the head officer on staff waved him through.\n\nInstalling the equipment, by comparison, had been a breeze. The airport had been completely empty besides a very small amount of janitorial staff, and nobody paid each other any mind outside of their own work. Once everything was hooked up (and facing towards the clusters of troops out on the tarmac and in the lobbies), they had quickly made their exit before anyone had any bright ideas about questioning them.\n\nAs he pulled up to the gatehouse, to his relief, the same troops who had given him pause when he first arrived were still there - and recognizing him, they waved him on through.

A few hours ago, the troops who had been gathering at the airport had suddenly moved out of the localized area that they had secured previously and began to spread through the airport. According to one of the newspapers that Campbell had furnished, the army had essentially forced any and all personnel out and replaced the essential personnel - such as the air traffic controllers - with their own men. One of the civilian controllers had said that they had come into the tower and told each controller to re-route any flights heading to Aberdeen to other airports, and as each controller had finished his list, was replaced with a military air traffic controller. He reported that they had not been treated ill, but there was enough tension in the air that no one had dared to resist their orders.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] rubbed his eyes and breathed out a sigh as Campbell finished the report. "So, it's safe to say that they had no authoritative permission to do this. No government official - not yourself and none of the other heads - had given them permission to do this?"\n\nCampbell replied, "No, [Root.GetLeader].

Giving one of the guards his papers and the work order that had been drawn up for them, it had seemed like they'd be let through rather quickly, without a hitch. That is, until the goddamn military police had arrived.\n\nThe officer in charge had taken one look at Abernathy and subsequently grabbed the papers from the guard who he'd been speaking to. He had proceeded to question him on several topics related to the documents and then walked away into the gatehouse and made a call. When he stepped out of the gatehouse, the papers were nowhere to be seen - instead, the officer brandished his pistol and directed his men to do the same with their firearms. His team had been dragged out of the van, and now here they were, about to be gunned down for God knows what. Suddenly, the quiet was broken by the officer's voice.\n\n"Alright, you Burgundian scum, do you have any last words?"\n\nAbernathy couldn't believe his ears and was about to respond when the officer spoke up once more.\n\n"That was a joke - there is no mercy for traitors or spies.

Apparently, from the moment the official investigative committee arrived at the airport, the military had more than just accommodated the officers. They had been allowed to conduct interviews with random soldiers, pilots, and officers. There was apparently even a luncheon where they had discussed the situation over a local meal.

The spies they had sent to observe and bug the fleet in Glasgow had been captured by the naval guard. This was a disaster! After an emergency meeting was called to discuss the recent development. [SCO.GetLeader] asked how they had been captured. The Secretary of Defense replied, saying how the original bug had been found after some officers had broken the table on accident. They had brought it to the Captain who had asked that the bug be put on the ground as a trap.\n\n[SCO.GetLeader] then asked what happened to the other three spies. The Secretary gulped and then said the same thing happened to the rest of them, all four had been duped by the Navy. [SCO.GetLeader] rubbed their temple and then sighed. This was not good at all."

Louis shrugged at his fellow spies and they walked to the meeting area. It had been a hive of activity since a few days ago. New recruits had flooded the docks, as it seems a recruitment drive had occurred. Once Captain Gordon had arrived he gave a short speech to the sailors.\n\n"Fellow Sailors, today is a good day for the Navy of Scotland. Our joint mission with the Coast Guard had succeeded. We had interdicted three smugglers who had attempted to destabilize our country, mostly coming from the English with goals to destabilize our country. However one of them was from the far reaches of Norway. Due to our cooperation with the coast guard, they will no longer pose a risk to any good Scottish citizen. Along with these victories, we had a recruitment drive that was aimed to recruit patriot citizens to our Navy. With our missions now succeeded, we can leave Glasgow."\n\nThe sailors cheered as they learned they would be out of port and back onto the ocean. Louis and the rest of the spies looked at each other. His mission would finally be over. The Captain ordered the sailors to attention and then dismissed them. The next few hours had been a hive of activity on the wharf. Sailors ran around, grabbing supplies and equipment and preparing to leave and steam back out to sea. The four spies had already packed up their surveillance tools.

I am honestly disappointed we are even having this conversation" He stops his rant and waits for a response from [SCO.GetLeader]\n\n"Well Captain, I apologize for this dearly.

Before [SCO.GetLeader] could say anything else, Captain Gordon cut him off\n\n"What the hell else would we be doing? We had been assisting the Coast Guard for interdiction and planning a recruitment drive, but then we had been forced out on our backs.

They both entered their panda car and drove to the wharf. Once there, they walked around the wharf to see if they could find another entrance before giving up and walking towards the front gate.\n\nAs they walked up to the sentry, he asked for the reason they had come here to the wharf. He looked at the two constables with confusion. Davies handed the sentry the warrant. The sentry looked at the warrant and then asked the two men to wait as he fetched a superior to bring to the two constables. Davies rolled his eyes as the sentry ran off to grab an officer. Rhys however was focused on the three men on the bridge of the SNS Anson who had been looking around at the River Clyde with a pair of binoculars and then marking spots down. He pulled Davie's arms to look at the bridge. The two men began to write the encounter down and then the sentry came back with a gruff looking officer. He took a look down at the warrant before grunting and letting the two constables into the wharf. As they had walked around the dock, they had started to observe the operation of the Navy. Men flowed in and out of the ships carrying all sorts of equipment. The two constables walked even further down the docks hoping to find something.\n\nAs they walked down the wharf, they came upon the end of the dock where it branched out to the left. Docked right next to it was the NSN Grafton, as they walked down it, they noticed that a piece of paper had flown out the window.

During the session, the officer said that the mission of the navy was to assist the coast guard in an interdiction mission and to start a recruitment drive in Glasgow. The two constables have verified this after two more officers have been brought in for questioning.\n\nEvidence Piece #004: A piece of paper was found by another constable during the investigation. The contents of it seem to be about a day of recruitment with plans for streamers and balloons to be set up around the wharf. It also has a list of local businesses that have agreed to put up signs promoting the Navy. Another list was also included of recruiters who would go into the local schools and on the streets trying to recruit the local populace to join the Navy.\n\nEvidence Piece #005: A folder was given to the police by the captain of the NSN Belfast Lewis Gordon. Inside of the folder had been photos of suspected smuggling vessels that had been sent into Scotland to drop off illegal weapons that could possibly end up in the hands of citizens with deeper aspirations who intended to overthrow the Scottish Government. They had been marked for interdiction and along with this in the folder had been photos of weapons that had been smuggled in and marked for destruction.\n\nSummary: While it may seem like at first, the Scottish Navy had looked suspicious due to their actions by docking in Glasgow, it seems to be a bit of confusion. After consideration and cross examination, it appears that the Scottish Navy have no plans to attempt to influence the government or scare the Glasgow City Council. Their reason for coming into Glasgow was to attempt a recruitment drive and help the coast guard out in a joint operation."

Inside them were pictures of Glasgow that had been marked with pens it seems and some other notes that included estimates of damages and number of shells that needed to be filed. Immediately after this, the two constables left and reported this to headquarters.\n\nEvidence Piece 002: In the file mentioned in the above passage, they contained photos of landmarks around Glasgow that had been marked for demolition. Due to the presence of the SNS Anson and its armament of 14-inch guns, it has been assumed that they are planning to bomb these marked locations to limit a response from the civil government in a coup d'etat. This has raised concerns in the internal police force about the ramifications of an uprising done by the military.\n\nEvidence Piece 003: A drawing that was retrieved by Constable Davies had been brought back to headquarters. The drawing was of Glasgow with more locations marked out on a map. While the quality of the drawing is quite shoddy, we have put more forensics agents on it to determine the areas that would receive extra security incase of an event such as a coup d'etat or bombardment by the navy.\n\nSummary: Due to these circumstances, the case has been considered officially closed, while inside the government, the case is very much still open. We have called both constables back from the assignment and have started to send in new ones due to fear of reprisals against Rhys and Davies. The central government in Edinburgh has been alerted of this and has currently been planning solutions to these developments."

No less than 5 MPs had walked in that morning alone, each with newspapers from different sources - yet all had said the same thing.\n\nIt appeared that the flights from SAF Lossiemouth had recently undergone a change in how they plan their practice flights, as the papers reported that there were far more flights near, and in some cases, over city centers. [SCO.getleader] leaned back in his black leather chair. He knew that the relationship between the military and the civilian government wasn't the friendliest right now, but surely they weren't planning bombing runs on Scottish cities?\n\nHe went through his thoughts and drew out the conclusions that made any amount of sense. It could be that they had simply changed their flight times - the SAF usually carried out practice missions during times of day when they wouldn't be as noticeable, be it the early morning, evening, and even night time. It could also be that they had decided it was time to switch up their flight routes, that the men had gotten too used to routine and the commanding officers had decided that they needed some shaking up.\n\nHowever... and that was the fulcrum on which this all balanced... however, it could be possible that the SAF was preparing for something. Preparing, not for a foreign threat, but a domestic one. And that's what worried [SCO.GetLeader]."

He had considered creating some form of proposal to [SCO.GetLeader] to allow him to send a few of his most trusted SIS agents to the base so that they could see if anything nefarious was being planned... but it seemed like [SCO.GetLeader] had been ahead of him, although in a wrong direction.\n\n"So what do you think, Jimmy? Should we go on in and arrest the officers? Start an inquiry? These changes to practice missions are too close to our population centers to make me comfortable."\n\nJimmy saw his chance. "Frankly, sir, while I do think we need to do some form of investigation, going in guns blazing may not be the right call. I'd recommend going in ca canny. Let me put together a surveillance team, which could then collect some information for us before we decide to take any action. After all, as you said, it could just be standard procedure - but it also might be, God forbid, a part of something bigger." \n [SCO.getleader] nodded.

High command had decided that this was the best way to get him inside - an officer would be too conspicuous, and a standard maintenance man would unlikely be allowed in to where he needed to go.\n\nHe thought of the other agents on this task - one, Agent Gilreath, who had already slipped in, as a grease monkey and was likely already planting his microphones along with other bugs amongst the planes on the airfield. Then there were Agents Hasting and Bannerman, who were in the sewers attempting to attach bugs to the numerous phone lines heading out from the base.\n\nThis was the big one. If any of them were caught, this whole operation would go up in flames and all Scotland would only suffer for it.\n\nThe guard finally closed his identification papers, handed them back to "Mr. Findley", and opened the gate to let him through. Once he found a parking spot reserved for on-site contractors, he grabbed his tools, his "fire alarms", and smoothly made his way to the headquarters located towards the east of the complex. Soon enough, he was inside the building, and got to work. He worked quickly, mapping out the paths of officers and guards as they passed. As he finished up installing an alarm in one of the rooms across from the map room, an officer stepped out the door and went on his merry way. Agent Atcheson took the opportunity to enter the room, having seen that there was nobody else in the room.

They had analyzed and reviewed hundreds of recordings and photographs, and with this final report Jimmy had brought to him, confirmed that the planes out of Lossiemouth had simply made a change in their flight paths and times.

The problem, however, was staring him in the face - these were Scottish cities and buildings.\n\n"My God..." whispered [SCO.GetLeader]. He had hoped it wouldn't have ever come to this... a hope that had been clearly misplaced.

Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Agent Gilreath - but he was not alone. He was being dragged towards a small building by two burly MPs and Acheson could swear that he looked bloodied.

One, it could be that they had simply decided to "test the waters", so to speak, and see if they needed further training on the new practice mission schedules. Having been satisfied, they went back to their old routines, as their old routines were more in-line with a defense of Scotland from foreign invasion.\n\nThe second conclusion, however - one much more dire - was that they had conducted enough missions to collect data for some other purpose, and to avoid suspicion had ceased the new flights. Either way, the flights had stopped, and there was little chance for them to find out any more information as to what was the deal with the strange flights."

"Disturbing the peace" he had called it, and "threatening the general welfare". Essentially, they had threatened the staff with all sorts of punishments, from dishonorable discharges to prison time if they did not resign themselves.

Halliday raised his eyebrows at that, then nodded, and walked out the door.\n\n[SCO.getleader] stood and walked to his window and stared out at, well, nothing in particular. He was lost in thought - these men had been trusted with the protection of Scotland and yet had seen fit to turn her own weapons against her."
 SCO.70822.a:0 "The evidence was clear. Now [SCO.GetLeader] had to make a decision."
 SCO.7086.t:0 "Army Movements in the Highlands"
 SCO.7086.desc:0 " [SCO.getleader] looked at the map pinned on the corkboard in front of him. He stood with Jimmy Halliday and the agent who had first taken notice of the strange movements.\n\n"And you're sure?" asked [SCO.GetLeader].\n\nThe agent spoke up before Halliday could. "Our intelligence outposts in the region had noted an increase in movement of men and equipment into the Highlands. A few of the agents we have embedded in the military as well as a few of the lower-ranking officers who cooperate with us notified us of the movement as well."\n\n[SCO.getleader] nodded and stared at the map along with Halliday. "We should get moving on this," said Halliday. "We have no idea what they could be planning - it could just be an ordinary exercise or they might be preparing for some sort of operation. There's no way of knowing with the information we have as we don't have any agents actually at the exercise, nor do we have eyes on them."\n\nRobert nodded once more. "Agreed. What are our options in terms of figuring out what's going on in the Highlands?"\n\nHalliday paused for a moment, thinking, before responding. "Well, we could go in loud and or we could try the quiet approach. Both have their own drawbacks. We could arrest the leaders of the exercise - generals, colonels, what have you, and begin an investigation as to what they were doing. We could also go in quietly - attempt to sneak in some agents while following up with aerial surveillance via a spy plane. Either way, there's a chance that either the infiltration will fail or the exercise turns out to be legitimate; and then we will have arrested some of our top military leaders falsely."\n\n[SCO.getleader] turned and asked the agent to leave. As soon as the door was shut, [SCO.GetLeader] and Halliday began deliberation as to which route would be the safest and the most rewarding."
 SCO.7086.a:0 "We need to do something, or else the opportunity to find the truth will be lost."
 SCO.70871.t:0 "Send Spy Planes and Security Service Agents to Infiltrate the Exercise"
 SCO.70871.desc:0 "You walk into the Prime Minister's office. All Jimmy Halliday had told you was that you were needed for a special assignment and that you need to pick someone who you thought would be reliable in an infiltration task. You had heard some talk of the military coagulating in the Scottish Highlands (news gets around fast at the Security Service headquarters), so while you could hazard a guess as to why you were needed, it was in fact anyone's guess. Maybe it was time to prepare for a fight against the damn collaborationists to the south, but really, you had no idea. As the wooden door swung open into the office, you quickly figured out your answer. To the right, you saw a map of the Scottish Highlands pinned to a board with different objectives marked out in black pen. To your left was a table of what could only be Scottish uniform and some tools, such as a small camera, a long-range radio, and so on. Directly in front of you stood your boss and your boss' boss - [SCO.GetLeader].\n\n"It's a pleasure to meet you, sir," you say as you shake [SCO.GetLeader]'s extended hand.\n\n"The pleasure is all mine, Agent Cragg. I wish we could meet under more agreeable circumstances, but unfortunately, you are here for work today." You nod, and Mr. Halliday speaks.\n\n"I'll be frank with you, Logan, this will be a dangerous mission. If you look at the map, you'll see the Scottish Highlands. I'm sure you've heard the rumour that the army was coalescing in that region for a training exercise - your mission will be to infiltrate the exercise and find out exactly what is going on. Tensions are at an all time high, and you need to find out if this exercise is an actual exercise to prepare for the English, or if it's to prepare for an action against Scotland."\n\nYou nod as Minister Halliday continues. After an hour of briefing and preparation, you are dismissed to a truck waiting outside with your team. You hop in the truck and drive off to a safehouse near the highlands."
 SCO.70871.a:0 "Spying is a risky business. God help us all."
 SCO.70872.t:0 "Our Spies Have Successfully Infiltrated the Exercise"
 SCO.70872.desc:0 "You do your best to mimic the gait that most of the soldiers seem to possess - tired, heavy-laden, and pushing just hard enough to keep pace with everyone. Of course, it isn't the easiest walk to mimic when you only recently began to be a part of the exercise, but you're able to figure it out... mostly. As you march with the other soldiers through the hills, you steal a glance at the sky. Somewhere up there was a small plane that was continually snapping photographs of what was going on on the ground, while you were making mental notes and taking photos on the ground, transmitting them at night.\n\nGetting in had not been too difficult - you had arrived with your team and split off into different directions around the main camp only to move into its heart at the multiple entrances, so as to not seem too suspicious. You had been brought before your commanding officer and explained that you had essentially lost your way out in the highlands. He had bought it, and after reviewing your (forged) documents, deemed you fit for duty and sent you on your way to be ingrained with your unit. You had been mixed in with a unit of infantrymen, and since a few days ago, been living the life of one.\n\nYou have been spending the last few nights mapping out the camp as well as the guard routes and their shift changes. You think it might be time either that night or the night after to attempt to sneak into the HQ and see what you could find. Even if everything seems straight forward, Director Halliday needed to know, or else they might make an uninformed and disastrous decision."
 SCO.70872.a:0 "It's a big risk, but one you know you need to take. For Scotland."
 SCO.70873.t:0 "It's a Standard Exercise"
 SCO.70873.desc:0 "As you sit in the middle of a thicket with your radio out, you take another look out at the nearby road to make sure you can't see any signs of anyone. You had identified this road as the one least travelled by the soldiers - it led to a remote village, but there was nothing there that usually attracted soldiers. No bars, no clubs, nothing - just a clan of people trying to make a living in the Highlands. After one last glance, you're satisfied that you shouldn't have any unwanted visitors and begin your transmission.\n\n"Sugar, Oboe, Charlie, Able, Nab, Tare, Love, Dog. How copy?"\n\nThe radio hisses back at you. "Roger, Free-1, we read you clear. What do you have to report?"\n\nYou clear your throat before you begin. "Command, there is nothing afoot here. It appears that this is simply a standard military exercise. My team and I have found no evidence that this is anything but standard. I've taken several photos of their map room, and the exercises I've participated in show that this is specifically to both prepare the men and keep them on their toes until such a time that we are at war with one of our enemies, be they German or Collaborators. Over."\n\nA moment passes and then another voice comes onto the radio - you recognize it as Minister Halliday. "Alright, Free-1, you and your team are free to extract. Do so at your earliest opportunity to minimize the chance of being captured. Dismissed." The radio went silent as Command cut the link. You pack up the radio and your other equipment in a pile, leaving it there so that you can grab it on your way out of the zone. Now all you have to do is sneak back into the headquarters, remove any trace of your identity, and then into your barracks to grab your "official" items, and leave."
 SCO.70873.a:0 "Piece of cake."
 SCO.70874.t:0 "It's a Simulation for Crushing Civilian Dissent and Rounding Them Up"
 SCO.70874.desc:0 "You almost run to the station you had set up in the brush a few days ago. Something in you keeps gnawing at your brain, making you feel paranoid. You look behind you, around you, looking for any sign of move- THERE! You shake your head as you realize it's simply a dog of some sort, likely from the nearby village. As you make your way to the thicket, you realize you're breathing fairly heavily and that your hands are shaking. You sit down in front of the radio and take a moment to collect yourself. The air is cold and it helps you calm down as it fills your lungs, stilling you. Finally, having collected yourself after a minute, you turn on the receiver. "Sugar, Oboe, Charlie, Able, Nab, Tare, Love, Dog. How copy?"\n\nSilence hangs in the air. You try again. "Sugar, Oboe, Charlie, Able, Nab, Tare, Love, Dog. How COPY?"\n\nThe silence stays for a moment until it's broken by the sweet crackle of the radio. "Roger, Free-1, we read you loud and clear. What's the report for today?"\n\nYou take a breath before beginning. "Sir, this isn't a standard military exercise. I was able to take some photos last night in the headquarters and some of the maps have areas marked as "rebels". I became suspicious and today it was confirmed - this isn't a military exercise, it's a simulation. They're practicing hunting down and rounding up any 'dissenters'. They even have some soldiers acting the part along with a few small pop-up towns that they made to practice riot control. I say again, this is not a standard exercise - they are preparing their men for controlling a popular resistance. You should be able to see the "towns" via the aerial photographs. Over."\n\nThe radio goes silent for a few minutes, leaving you to wonder if you've been discovered and cut. The radio crackles again, filling you with relief. "Roger, your directive now is to abandon the area. Get your team together and cut out as soon as humanly possible. We don't need you being captured. Over and out.""
 SCO.70874.a:0 "We've gotta get out of here and quick. There's no time to lose."
 SCO.70875.t:0 "Our Spies Have Been Caught!"
 SCO.70875.desc:0 "You quietly approach the crate in the makeshift warehouse. The warehouse was empty save for one guard outside, protecting the sole official entrance into the building, but you had made your own with the crowbar you had brought along when you first departed from the safehouse. As you begin to pry at a crate, for if you know what they have stored, you have an idea of what they have planned, you hear a commotion start developing outside. Suddenly, the door to the warehouse swings open and several armed men come inside, and begin taking positions around the goods, seemingly in order to protect whatever was inside. You see an opening before one of the guards takes position, however, and lunge through the little opening you made.\n\nAs you crawl out into the darkness, you realize that the camp is more alive than it had any reason to be at this hour. Men are running around, some armed, others not. You look to the side and see that one of the AA positions is crawling with a team. You realize something is clearly wrong, but you don't know what that is until the AA position begins booming, shooting projectiles at something in the sky. You get a sinking feeling as you look up and see the silhouette of a plane. It's not a German or an English plane. It's the spy plane that Halliday sent out nightly to take photographs.\n\nBefore your thoughts could go on, you hear the sound of a hammer being pulled back. "On the ground!" yells a voice behind you. Well, this is the end, you think to yourself. You drop your crowbar and lie down on the ground as you hear more and more footsteps gather around you. Someone puts your hands behind your back and cuffs you. You realize that maybe they should have equipped you with a cyanide pill, because there's no telling what they'll do when they find out you're from the Security Service."
 SCO.70875.a:0 "You could only imagine the fallout of tonight's actions..."
 SCO.70876.t:0 "The Military Exercise has Ended"
 SCO.70876.desc:0 ""So it's over then. We don't have any more chances." [SCO.getleader] stated to Halliday, looking for confirmation.\n\nHalliday nodded. "The exercises are over - the main base of operations is already dismantled and the army has split off to head back to their individual bases. You can't really investigate something that no longer exists."\n\n[SCO.getleader] breathed out and sank into his seat. He thought on the army exercises a bit more and reasoned that no more brain power should be wasted on this particular event. It had come, and it had gone. He hoped, of course, that the exercises had been legitimate and designed to prepare for a fight with an external enemy. However, there was no way to confirm that any longer. At least, he thought to himself, they hadn't decided to take that moment to descend from the Highlands on the rest of Scotland and install a martial government. Of course, that didn't mean they wouldn't do it in the future - God knows the relationship between the civilian government and the Scottish military apparatus wasn't in good shape. "Alright," he finally said to Jimmy Halliday. "We may have missed this opportunity, but we won't miss the next one if possible. Who knows what the military is up to?"\n\nHalliday nodded. It was a sad fact, but a fact nonetheless, that while the civilian government technically had power over the military, the military itself was a mostly private entity. There wasn't much that they shared with the government. Everything had to be pried from them."
 SCO.70876.a:0 "And if they do something like this again, then pry we will."
 SCO.70877.t:0 "Arresting the Ringleaders Backfires"
 SCO.70877.desc:0 "We ordered the exercise to stop. Soldiers are disgruntled because it was regular scheduled training the notification for the training was apparently lost in the postroom according to an investigation"
 SCO.70877.a:0 "An escalation of tensions is on the horizon..."
 SCO.70878.t:0 "Arresting the Ringleaders Justified!"
 SCO.70878.desc:0 "Sergeant Malcolm Bath along with several other NCO's stood before the Prime Minister and the Minister of Security. The last few days had been harrowing for just about everyone.\n\nThere had been a large commotion when the Security Service had arrived at the Highlands to arrest the men in charge of the exercise, but it couldn't have been called a negative reaction to the arrest. While some men had complained and protested, stating "Once again, the government interferes in our affairs", Malcolm and several of his compatriots had disagreed. As they had recounted to the PM and to the Security Service officers who had interrogated them beforehand, the exercise had seemed odd to just about all of them.\n\nThe exercises, they explained, had seemed to be less about fighting a formal enemy, and more about fighting some sort of internal enemy. While they had set-up positions designed to fight an encroaching army, the majority of the troops were given orders more in-line with a dissent suppression effort. Furthermore, the exercise ground had been transformed into a sort of city, and they had even practiced instituting martial law, with some of the soldiers being chosen to play the part of civilians.\n\nOverall, it had been dubious, but the army had operated under the assumption that the exercise was legitimate - the officers admitted they had led themselves to believe that they were training more for an invasion of England, rather than themselves being invaded.\n\nAt the end of their explanations, the Prime Minister dismissed them. Their escorts led them back to the vehicles they had arrived in, but instead of being sent back to what was, in reality, a prison, they were driven back to the nearby barracks. The lead Security Service officer explained that, as a result of their honesty, patriotism, and willingness to cooperate, they were being released to their units. Bath couldn't help but wonder..."
 SCO.70878.a:0 "What's going to happen to the rest of the men?"
 SCO.7088.t:0 "Open an Investigation into the Highlands Exercise"
 SCO.7088.desc:0 ""Sending men into the exercise is an incredibly risky maneuver. If they were discovered, then there could be major backlash - possibly worse than if we started an official investigation into the exercises." [SCO.GetLeader] said to Halliday. "Further, if we do decide to conduct an investigation, we may have access to more documentation than if we sent a few men to attempt to infiltrate the headquarters. We could find something that they might have missed."\n\nHalliday nodded - although he didn't personally agree with all of the points [SCO.GetLeader] put forth, he was the Minister of Security and [SCO.GetLeader] was the Prime Minister - the final decision lay with him. Besides... There's a reason he was predisposed to choosing the more quiet options. "I'll have my people begin drawing up the necessary documentation for us to open an official investigation. I assure you, sir, if there's evidence of this being anything but a standard exercise, we'll find it." And if there isn't, he thought to myself, we'll end up paying for it.\n\n[SCO.getleader] nodded. "I'll ensure the proper warrants and directives are provided as well. We wouldn't want this to be seen as clear government overreach, but as a genuine concern. Hopefully, we'll be correct in this matter."\n\nHalliday agreed and excused himself from the room. They would need to move fast - if they announce an official investigation without having anything ready beforehand, or if somehow the investigation is leaked to the military ahead of time, they may end up sifting through ash rather than whole documents, which would kill the investigation before it even began. Halliday sat at his desk in his office and picked up the phone."
 SCO.7088.a:0 "So much to do, so little time."
 SCO.70881.t:0 "The Exercise was Planned and Approved."
 SCO.70881.desc:0 " [SCO.getleader] rubbed his eyes as his chauffeur made his way through Edinburgh back to the main Parliament building. It had been, frankly, a terrible beginning to the day. The investigation had commenced not too long ago, and it had officially been shown to be the edge of a cliff, one they had driven right off of.\n\nHalliday had warned him the other day that the investigation at the time was turning up little in the way of showing fault with the army. In fact, Halliday had warned, one of his agents had notified him that one of the officers being questioned had documents showing that the government had received advance notice of the exercise and had pre-approved it.\n\nSure enough, that had been the smoking gun for the army at the hearing this morning. The Security Service had made its case first, citing strange troop movements, reports of a large collective of soldiers and equipment in the Highlands, and the lack of notification. The officers, however, had essentially put a gun to the head of the accusation and pulled the trigger. They had brought their own documents from the actual exercise. This would have likely been enough to show that their hands had been clean, but the real "trigger" moment took place when they showed a board documenting the process of the approval of the exercise. It had been put forth by a few officers, approved by their seniors and passed on up to the generals, who had also approved it and then put forth the plans to the government. Sure enough, there were papers with the signatures of several government officials officially allowing the exercise. Afterwards, when [SCO.GetLeader] had taken aside the officials and questioned them, it became clear that their "copy", so to speak, had been lost to the limbo of the bureaucratic system.\n\n[SCO.getleader] sank back into the leather, wondering what could have been done differently."
 SCO.70881.a:0 "If there ever was a moment showing their incompetence..."
 SCO.70882.t:0 "The Exercise was Designed for Local Unrest"
 SCO.70882.desc:0 "[SCO.getleader] sat contentedly outside, enjoying the morning air and a strong cup of coffee. Halliday had called him early in the morning and had asked to meet with him even before the sun had come up. [SCO.GetLeader] had at first feared that something had gone terribly wrong, but once he arrived at his office, those fears had been quickly dispelled by Halliday's wide grin.\n\nOnce in the Prime Minister's office, Halliday had quickly launched into the results of the investigation. After spending fruitless hours sifting through documents and interviewing officers along with soldiers, they had found a gold mine. An officer, a lieutenant involved in the exercise, had come forward and brought several maps and photographs with him.\n\nEssentially, he had blown the lid off of what the army had been hiding. According to his own account along with several of the files he had brought with him, the army had been conducting exercises associated with suppressing dissidence and instituting martial law. This in and of itself wouldn't be an issue... that is, if the government hadn't had any plans to institute martial law in the future. Furthermore, he had a few connections with some other officers and soldiers who were of the like mind that this was in no way good news who were willing to speak up as long as they were guaranteed protection from any sort of action.\n\nBy the time Halliday had finished with his report, [SCO.getleader] was both jubilant and concerned. He was glad that they had evidence showing that the exercise was designed for nefarious purposes, but he was also concerned. Could they successfully arrest the officers without backlash? And even more worrying was the fact that the army had dared to conduct an exercise of this size and of this sort of target right in front of their faces."
 SCO.70882.a:0 "Even as he celebrated, he feared for Scotland's future."
