 GreatGame_Category_desc:0 "Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and France. Ever since Italy and the Reich split from each other, these nations have been the target of a constant diplomatic game of §Yinfluence§!. A game that continues to this day.\n\nThe Great Game is played in §Y5§! rounds and the best of §Y5§! wins, not unlike the game, §YSette e mezzo§!.\n\nBoth the §YItalian§! and §YGerman§! diplomats will face a series of §Ydecisions§! or cards in each round.\n\nStarting from a random base of diplomatic effort in the ever-shifting game, the goal is to hit diplomatic success, represented by the value of §Y10§!, with the Germans represented by the §Yleft hand card§! and the Italians by the §Yright hand card§!.\n\nHowever the art of diplomacy is a fickle thing. §RPush too hard and over 10 and the round is lost.§!\n\nIf both parties go over or stay below 10, then the higher value wins. An equal effort means a draw.\n\nHave the majority of the issues stalemate in the diplomatic battle and the target might decide that neutrality is the better choice.\n\nGerman Turns Won: [?GER.great_game_turn_win|Y0]\nItalian Turns Won: [?ITA.great_game_turn_win|Y0]"

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "We will send our allies in Bulgaria new rifles to help their government equip their under-armed security units."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_1_decision_1:0 "Establish Connections with the Fatherland Front"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "The various factions of the Fatherland Front are the perfect allies to sabotage German influence in Bulgaria. They are an Anti-German alliance who would love nothing more than to boot out the Hun. Establishing communications with this underground movement is a must!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Send Over Additional Guards"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Bulgaria has a crippling lack of manpower. Sending some Guard units to increase our garrison's presence would greatly increase our influence in the region."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Infiltrate the Cities"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "If we are to subvert the Germans and break Bulgaria away from the Reich's influence, we need eyes on the ground. Information wins wars; we need to be in the know on the ground at all times."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Train New Guards"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Our new Guard units in Bulgaria lack training. Providing some instructors for them will greatly increase their experience."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Buy Connections in the Front"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "The Fatherland Front is woefully under armed. As of now, they stand no chance against the small German garrison and their Bulgarian stooges. For now, this is to our advantage;  we can buy connections in the Fatherland Front with the guns that they desperately need."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_4:0 "The New Bulgarian Man"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Germans can not make up the bulk of the Bulgarian security forces; we simply don't have the means. Therefore, we should start a small propaganda campaign to increase political support for their government so they can stabilize their country themselves."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Fake \"Riots\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "The Fatherland Front needs to be put down once and for all. This will never happen if the common Bulgarian is totally indifferent to this group of traitors. We need to stir up domestic tensions; we can cause some local disturbances and blame it on the rabble rousers."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Fake Identifications for Front Members"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Many of the members of the underground Fatherland Front have been blacklisted and are forced to hide underground. We can help out our newfound allies by creating them new identifications and birth certificates. Bulgaria is notorious for its backwardness; we shall use this to our advantage!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Frame the FF for Attacks"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The biggest threat to our influence in Bulgaria is by far the Fatherland Front. If these partisans have been a constant thorn in our side; if we were to turn the population against them by making them out as brigades, it could increase our popularity in the region."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Smuggle Uniforms to the Front"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "If our allies look the part, there is a good chance we could plant Fatherland Front members into the lower echelons of the Bulgarian army. Their role calls are a mess, and some quickly forged \"redeployment orders\" with the proper equipment could enable us to quickly infiltrate the army."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Spark a Fire"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "If we want to scare the public, the perfect target would be an important government office in Sofia. Our men already guard many of these buildings; it would be simple to light one on fire ourselves and present a Fatherland Front bandit as the perpetrator..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Distract Bulgaria's General Staff"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "The Bulgarian's do keep a close eye on their army, as much as it pains us to admit it. It is troublesome for some of our allies in the Front to infiltrate the Bulgarian army. We could create a distraction in their General Staff by flexing our military might by sponsoring a series of small scale wargames in Albania."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Mobilize the Garrison"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "The Bulgarians are still not declaring a State of Emergency. Mobilizing our men would likely be sufficient to scare the government enough and push them the extra step that we need, but it would sour our relations with them."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Lobby for Amnesty"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "To take Bulgaria's eyes off of their internal security temporarily, we could send an Italian delegation to demand the legalization of the various political parties that make up the Fatherland Front, as well as amnesty for all of the Front's members. The Bulgarians will, of course, not agree to this. These demands will be seen as totally unacceptable, but it will give our friends the cover they need to infiltrate the army."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Arm the Detachments"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "The Front has become increasingly troublesome. Any security personal in the field in Bulgaria should get a rifle; the Bulgarians would be indebted to us once again if we send them more arms."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Utilize our Contacts in the Administration"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "We need to get into direct contract with Tsar Simeon. By utilizing our local contacts, we can circumvent the Germans and their lap dogs."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Launch Propaganda Campaigns"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Support for the Tsar has continued to wane. We need to turn public perception around and portray him as the father figure the country needs."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Identify Anti-German Administrations"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Not all Bulgarians in government are Nazi stooges. We need to find the men loyal to the Tsar and identify them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Eliminate the \"Bandits\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Fatherland Front members are nothing more than bandits! We're going to send out our garrison in Sofia and hunt them down."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Help Loyalists Infiltrate the Guard"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Part of the reason it's so hard for us to make contact with the Tsar is that he is surrounded by Germans and their collaborator lackies. If we funnel loyalists in the army supplies, we could get friends close to the Tsar."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Aerial Reconnaissance "
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Our enemies hide deep in the countryside. If we are going to hunt them down like the rats they are, we need to locate them. Luckly, the Luftwafe is more than adequate for this task."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Place Simeon Under House Arrest"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Our intelligence agents have tipped us off that the Italians are trying to get into direct contact with Tsar Simeon. Under no circumstances can we let this happen. We will send a regiment of our garrison to Simeon's house and serve as his guards for the time being, whether the Bulgarians like it or not."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Arm the Fatherland Front"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "It is time for the people of Bulgaria to fight for their freedom! Any man willing to fight for freedom from the Nazi hegemony should be given a rifle!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Strongarm the Opposition"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "During this political turmoil, some of the Tsar's own advisors have come out of the woodworks to voice their \"concerns\". We aren't fooled; the administration is testing the waters and trying to rally support. This is unacceptable; we need to put them back in their places."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Spread Rumors"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "The SS poisoned the Tsar! Hitler abducts dissidents and sends them to death camps! The German garrison has the government held at gunpoint! True or not, it doesn't matter. We only need to anger the people and get them to rise up against the Reich."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Acquire Support From the Military"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "We have more than a few friends in the Bulgarian military. It's time to call in our favors with our allies there and get their badge of approval. The Bulgarian military's support could be decisive in the coming days."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Encourage Protests"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The people's will must be known! The Tsar does not stand alone against the Germans; the people chafe against their occupiers. Encouraging people to rally together in the streets will show the Germans that they are not wanted in Bulgaria!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Bribe Neutral Administrators"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "There are more than a few administrators in the Bulgarian government who are on the fence, so to speak. While not outright hostile to our influence, we wouldn't consider them exactly friendly either. Some cash to show our appreciation for all their hard work would win more than a few of these neutrals over to our cause."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Attack German Outposts"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Our allies don't have the means to directly assault German complexes yet. Small groups of Italian special operatives can be sent to Bulgaria to hit German fortifications and shake our arrogant foe's morale."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Deploy the Garrison"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "A huge wave of protesters and traitors are rising up in Sofia! If not dealt with swiftly, these people could threaten our dominance in Bulgaria. This must be stopped at once; deploy our garrison!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Help Organize the Uprising"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The Fatherland Front is nearly ready to take back their capital! However, they have no real plan other than to take to the streets en mass. This will not do; we shall send some of our professional army staff officers to help them plan the uprising."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Arrest Known Leaders"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to the Bulgarian administration, our intelligence agents have a list of known Fatherland Front members; a number of them which are key organizers in the party. Arresting these organizers and leaders will throw this \"uprising\" into disarray."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Distract the German Garrison"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "The biggest obstacle the uprising is going to face is the hardened German garrison in Sofia. If we send some of our own men in plain clothes to hit the German's logistics, we could potentially draw a large number of them out of the city on a fruitless chase through the countryside."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Move the Tsar Out of Sofia"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "The Tsar is proving to be problematic. He himself is not keen on continued German influence in Bulgaria, and an endorsement of this rebellion by him could prove disastrous. For his own \"security\" and \"safety\", we could move him out of the city temporarily."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Arm the Masses"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "To no surprise, a large number of the common folks in Sofia are sick and tired of the rampant German dominance of their country. Arming these people would greatly increase the revolt's chances of success."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Shoot Armed Protesters"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Armed mobs have taken to the streets. The situation is tense, but no street fighting has broken out... yet. We can not tolerate such open defiance; any citizen wielding a firearm shall be shot on sight by our men!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Call in All of Our Favors"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Bulgarians in government positions all over the country owe us favors. Police chiefs, army officers, administrators and more owe us, and there's no better time to collect our favors than now."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Call in Reinforcements"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "It's clear; we don't have enough German boots on the ground to contain this uprising. We need more men in the field if we are going to remain in control of Sofia."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Activate Our Cells in the Army"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "During the last couple of months, we've gotten a number of Fatherland Front agents into the Bulgarian Army. It's time to activate these agents to sow confusion and disarray in the rank. This will slow down their response times, and give the uprising a better chance at success."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_1:0 "Reconnect with Old Friends"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "Though our relationship with Hungary has soured over the decade, we still have a number of friends in high places from the glory days of the Reich. Reconnecting with them would be a good first step towards mending our relationship with them."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1:0 "Send an Italian Delegation"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "It has been nearly a decade since an Italian delegation has been sent to Hungary. If we want to repair our damaged relations with them, we need to send some of our higher ranker officials to show that we're serious, and want to work with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Fund the Arrow Cross"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "During the Second World War, the best of all the Hungarians were part of the Arrow Cross party. Ferociously nationalistic and aware of the danger of Eternal Jew, the Arrow Cross is the Hungarian equivalent of the Nazi party. They are our natural allies, and are worthy of our funding. Their gratitude will be well worth the cost."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Reopen the Hungarian Embassy"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Ever since our relations with Germany collapsed in the 50s, the Hungarian embassy has been closed due to their alignment with Germany. Times have changed, however. Reopening the embassy would be a good first step to establishing our ties with the Hungarian government."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Train the Paramilitaries"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Paramilitaries in Hungary are almost exclusively nationistic patriots aghast at Hungary's embarrassing defeats in the 50s. These men would be thrilled and indebted to us if we help train these zealous patriots."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Offer Favorable Trade Deals"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Trade between the Italian and Hungrian markets is almost non-existent at the moment. We can change this by offering the Hungranian government favorable import and export rates to encourage more trade."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Ignore German Restrictions "
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Technically, the Reich has a plethora of trade and diplomatic restrictions in place that any foriegn countries need to deal with when trying to establish relations with a member of their so called \"Pakt\". In reality, these restrictions are nothing more than formalities. We can safely ignore them at the expense of our already deteriorating relations with the Reich."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Deploy our Agents"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 ""The German minority along the Danube is rather sizable. The Hungarian government tends to leave those who pay their taxes alone, and Aryans are certainly no expectation. A few more German faces amongst the crowds won't raise suspicions..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_1:0 "A Lavish Party for the Hungarian Diplomats"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "For the first time in a decade, Hungarian diplomats occupy an embassy in Rome! This calls for celebration! We are going to throw a huge party to celebrate this momentous occasion."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Exploit Family Ties"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of our citizens within the Reich have family connections with our brothers in Hungary. We can use these ties to our advantage; the loyal Aryans to our south would like nothing more than to see a pro-Reich government in power, and will be more than happy to work with our agents."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Praise the Administration"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "Considering the hand they were dealt, so to speak, Hungary's current administration has done an admirable job this last decade keeping the country together and stable. Acknowledging this will strengthen our relations with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Bribe Locals"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Many Hungarian Germans are sadly apathetic to our cause, and won't assist our agents and spies out of their good will or patriotism. Though disappointing and unbecoming of true Germans, this isn't an issue money can't solve."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Offer Economic Assistance"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "The Hungarian economy has been in a pitiful state since the market crash of the 50s. The Germans have been slow to reinvest and assuage their pain; this gives us the opportunity to invest ourselves, which will tie our two countries closer together."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Encourage Fascist Rallies"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "The Hungarian government is weak. It is under indecisive rule that their people struggle; they need a strong, central, nationalist government. Let us lend our voices in support and help organize Fascist rallies in Hungary."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Military Advisors"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "Fringe elements in Hungary are becoming restless. The far right, spearheaded by the Arrow Cross party are raising up paramilitaries while the liberals organize and gain more influence. Our best bet is to stand with the current administration; sending a number of military advisors will make any of their opposition hesitate before acting against the administration."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Smuggle Radicals Guns"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Among the fringe of Hungarian lay in hiding some really crazies. We don't align with them politically, but they can still be of use to the Reich. Smuggling these radicals weapons could potentially be devastating to Hungary's stability."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Send Security Detachments"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Several key Hungarian instilitations and government buildings are exposed to enemy espionage and sabotage. At the moment, the Hungarian government does not have the manpower to protect them. We can offer some of our own military police units as temporary guards."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Criticize the Central Government"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "\"The Hungarian government is weak! True blooded Hungarians lay stranded in half a dozen countries as the administration struggles to even fund itself! And the state of the army!\""
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Endorse the Status Quo"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Our allies in the Hungarian government have few friends, both at home and abroad. This emboldens the fringe elements in Hungary and makes them more aggressive. By endorsing the administration, we both indebt Hungary to us and reduce the radical right's activity."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Remind Hungary of Past Glories"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "\"You used to be great. What happened? Carpathia used to be yours! You had humbled the Romanians, the slavs of the Balkans, and marched hand in hand with us to Moscowien! Your prosperity used to be the envy of Central Europe! Have you already forgotten?\""
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Find and Eliminate Dissent"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "To our surprise, there are hardliners more extreme than even the Arrow Cross party and the underground communities that lurk in the forests and basements of Hungary. Help rooting them out will get us a lot of good will from the government."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Remind Hungary Who Their Friends Are"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "For over two decades, the Reich and Hungary have worked together to achieve our mutual goals. The relationship has been rocky, sure, but through it all, Germany has been friends to the Hungarian people. We would be foolish not to remind them of this."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Discredit the Arrow Cross Party"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Arrow Cross is a party of fools. It will only take a little effort to dig up obnoxious quotes and racist slogans to put them in a bad public light and discredit them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Remind Them of Their Greatness!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "And how could anyone say that Hungary wasn't great? For over a decade, the Hungarian people were all united under one flag, in one country. Their economy was unrivaled in Central Europe! There is no reason for them not to celebrate their past achievements, nor to strive for them again."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Help Organize Unity Marches"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Hungary is a very diverse country. Hungarians, Croats, Romanians, Germans, and more all co-exist together. A show of solidarity; all of the peoples marching hand in hand will push the fringe radicals to the sides."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Remind Them of Their Sacrifice!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Many young men died to secure Hungary's place in the world. Hungarian blood was shed achieving what Napoleon himself couldn't conquer. An entire nation gave their time and energy for the greater good; the total destruction of the Eternal Jew, The Red Hydra, and the safety of their people for generations to come. Their sacrifice should not; can not be forgotten."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Expose the Hardliners"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The hardcore Fascists and other fringe elements in Hungarian politics love to jump at the chance to cause chaos, then blaming the results on the inadequacy of the government. We can expose these men for the anarchists they really are, which will help the Hungarians stabilize."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Spread Anti-Government Propaganda"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "The Hungarian people don't like to think about it, but they know their current government is imcompetent. A little funding and some under-handed propaganda will see faith in the Hungarian government fall even lower."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Remind them of Germany's Betrayal"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Are diplomats should be quick to point out the many times the Reich has left the Hungarians in the dust. When Romania invaded them in their time of weakness, the Reich stood by. It was the Germans who totally collapsed the Hungarian economy. Germany has been nothing but trouble for Hungary, and we would be foolish not to remind them of this."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_5:0 "Promote National Socialism"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "Few people are followers of National Socialism in Hungary. Promoting our ideology in the region could strengthen our ties with the Hungarians, if we can get enough of them to follow our ideals."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Send Military Advisors"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The best way to insure Hungary stays within the Pakt is to offer them aid. Their military has atrophied this last decade; any help we could give them would be much appreciated on their part."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Send Engineers"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The Hungarians are rightfully worried about their border security. Their entire north is menaced by the Reich. To help them feel more secure, we could send some of our army engineers to assist with building fortifications."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Invest in the Economy"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "More than anything, Hungary needs our help with rebuilding their economy. Ever since the market crash in the 50s, Hungary has been crippled and not been able to really get up on their own two feet. We should offer them a helping hand."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Pledge Italian Support"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "We should make an official statement giving the Hungarians our support. Doing so will let them know that Italy is on their side and is a viable alternative to remaining a Pakt puppet."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Give Hungary Arms"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Thanks to little military development for a decade, the Hungarian army is lacking in many materials, especially guns. The Heer contains a huge stockpile of weapons; sending some of these to our allies will show our goodwill to our friends."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Guarantee Hungary's Independence"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "The threat of a German invasion is the only thing that keeps Hungary subservient to the Reich. If we were to guarantee Hungary's, it could be the boost that they need to leave the Pakt for good and join us."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Help Motorize the Army"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "The average infantry man in the Hungarian army is still a footman, and they even use horses to draw up supplies from their bases! It is time to help them modernize; we will send the Hungarian some much needed heavy duty trucks that can be deployed for a multitude of uses."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Help Build AA Defenses"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Perhaps Hungary's most glaring defect is its almost total lack of air defenses. If the Luftwaffe were ever to strike, the entire country would be nearly defenseless. Helping to modernize and build new anti-air defenses gives the Germans less tools to threaten Hungary with."

 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "If we are going to reestablish our ties with our old friends in Romania, we will need to find where they're operating out of.  The Iron Guard has been operating underground for nearly a decade now; finding them could prove to be difficult, but it is essential we do so."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_1:0 "Send Over Peacekeepers"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "Ever since most of the far right parties in Romania were banned, a large underground resistance has been terrorizing the countryside. Terrorist attacks and bombings in the citys are far too frequent as well; Romania could very well use additional men to help keep order."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Pledge to Help the Guard"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "As it stands, without foriegn help, the Iron Guard will never be able to sit at the proverbial table. The Monarchy is happy to sideline the Romanian right wing since it doesn't conform to Mihai's degeneracy.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Give Away Alpine Equipment"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Much of the Romanian country-side is rugged; vast mountains and valles lay covered in dense forests.

 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Establish Radio Connections"

 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Lease over Military Trucks"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "For all their oil, the Romanians have a serious lack of military grade vehicles. Shipping them some of our trucks would be much appreciated by the Romanian government."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Find the Guardsmen in Plain Sight"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Not every Iron Guardsman is a freedom fighter based out of the hills and forests. There are a large number of regular, every day citizens who have "renounced" their old beliefs and komrads and have reintegrated back into society. Naturally, many of these people act as the eyes and ears of the underground movement. Connecting with these agents would be a good first step to get in touch with the Iron Guard's leadership."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Train Their Infantrymen"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "The hardened core of the Romania army was once a force to fear. Veterans of the great battlefields of the east; many of them have since retired or gone into hiding; a large portion of these men were Iron Guard members. The Romanian army now has a chronic lack of experienced officers and trainers; a detachment of drill segartents would be much appreciated by the Romanians."

 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Smuggle Fake Papers for our Friends"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "The Iron Guard knows how to blend in with the civilian population, and many of them know how to carry themselves as government officials; many in the Guard once worked for the state or served in the army. What holds them back is their papers; they don't have the means of forging authentic documents. With our help, we can get more than a few Iron Guard members back to the cities in plain sight and into positions of importance."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Set up an Unbiased Military Court"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Not every Romanian on the right is an anti government terrorist. In the Monarchy's fear, they blacklisted many Romanians who were otherwise loyal citizens, forcing these exiles into hiding and lives of crime to survive. Any arbitration would need a third party to oversee any amnesty offers. We should offer to oversee any and all arbitration; a neutral third party is exactly what the administration needs to start the process of healing."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Contact Sympathetic Officials"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "There are more than a few men in the Romanian government who fell through the cracks during the purges of the 50s. Others who sat by looked on with disgust as the heroes from the Great War were declared traitors and forced to flee to the mountains for their lives. Many are still bitter about this, and with a little prodding would be happy to help their betrayed brethren."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Suggest Mass Prisoner Paroles"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "Romanian prisons are full of political prisoners from the far right that the state deemed were too dangerous to let free, thanks to their political affiliation. The most radical should still rot, but there are many men and women who would be more than happy to shed their affiliations in exchange for parole."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Infiltrate the Army"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Since the army gutted itself of its finest men, it has been a disorganized mess. With the proper weapons and uniforms, we can help the Iron Guard reconnect with the sympathetic officers and other Guardsmen who flew under the radar and get them into the army undetected."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Stop the Shoot on Sight Order"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "The various rebels in the countryside are loath to approach the army, even when their morale is broken and they want to surrender? Why? Because the Romanians have a shoot on sight order for any political partisans spotted. If we want to get the Romanians to stop killing each other, we should convince them to stop the shoot on sight orders so commonly given to the men on the frontlines."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Mobilize the Urban Cells"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "Countless civilians in the cities have faithfull stood by the Iron Guard for over a decade, even after the party was declared illegal. These cells are isolated, however. We need to make contact with the various cells and get them ready for action."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Go Easy on the Rouges"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "Many outliers on the right became targeted as the state clamped down on the right. People with no other affiliations to the hard right other than being a family member of a hardliner, or other trivial exceptions got lumped into the larger blacklists and were forced underground or imprisoned. Many of these people are simple victims of circumstance; we should request the Romanians take a second look at these folks and let them be."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_5:0 "Bribe the Corrupt"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_2_decision_5_desc:0 "Kicking out the best Romanians from the government had some seriously negative results. Many lower posts are abused, and corruption is rampant in the countryside. We can turn this to our advantage; a little capital could buy us some very important figures across Romania."

 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Build an \"Underground\" Supply Network"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "The Iron Guard are virtually cut off from the rest of the world. Few forigen governments support or praise their cause, even out of hand. The Guard chronically lacks supplies and materials, and is only able to continue to resist out of the countryside by scavenging any munitions they can get their hands on. Starting an underground supply chain would help their efforts immensely."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Improve the Refineries"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "Romania's life blood is its oil. Most of the country's exports are some sort of petroleum, and it makes good money from this. Their refineries however are virtual relics; Italian ingenuity could vastly improve the efficiency of these refineries."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Get Guns into Romania"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "More than anything, the Iron Guard and its various exiled allies need weapons. Many of their current arsonals are made up almost exclusively from World War II surplus. These guns are old and are outperformed in nearly every category by modern rifles; it's time the Guard gets its long overdue upgrade."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Help Improve the Rigs"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "The biggest bottleneck in the Romanian economy is their output of oil. Their drilling rigs are simply not up to scratch; we should help them improve the drills scattered across the country."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Airdrop Advisors"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Our allies on the ground are not all old, grizzled veterans. Many in the Iron Guard are young, eager nationalists that chafe under their degenerate monarchy. These men lack professional training, and even the more experienced Guardsmen could learn a thing or two about guerilla warfare. We could help our friends by sending some advisors to train the Guard into a fearsome guerilla army."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Invest in the Civilian Economy"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Most of the Romanian economy is tied, one way or another, to oil. LIttle to no diversification exists. Our banks should use this opportunity to make investments into Romania and open some industries that aren't tied to petroleum."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Rally the Right"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The Iron Guard are not the only right leaning group looking for a chance to lunge at the Monarchy's throat. We need to rally the other underground parties around the Iron Guard and get them ready for the inevitable uprising."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Create a Military Industrial Complex"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Military industry in Romania is... lackluster. For all their resources, they have woefully little armament output. Some investments and encouragement on our end could see the creation of a joint Italian-Romanian military complex."

 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Help Spread Anti-Monarchy Propaganda"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Michael I is a traitor to Romania! While his brave countrymen fought to make Romania great, he sat and plotted the downfall of those who had released Romania's ambitions! He is a crony; a crook, corrupted to the core by capitalism! The Monarchy is rotten to the core, and the people need to know!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Send Security Detachments"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Some has the right leaning rebels in the countryside riled up. The Iron Guard and various other illegal organizations have become noticeably more active. We should send some of our men as security to help shore up the Romanian army."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Agitate the Population"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "The population is uneasy; they feel the change in the air. As our friends intensify their struggles and prompt their cause, more and more of the common people take notice. All it would take is a little push to get them to take action against the government."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Guns for the Army"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "The Romanian army is worse off than we thought; there are infantry units still training with rifles from the Great War! These guns in this day and age are totally insufficient, especially when up against the veteran Iron Guard partisans. We need to help out our allies at once!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Send more Guns!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Many Romanian citizens are already enraged at their government, and wish to take action. All we would need to do is to funnel more guns into their willing hands."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Boots for the Men"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The army doesn't only seriously lack guns; everything from uniforms to footwear is in high demand. The Romanian's would be indebted to us if we helped them get their infantrymen the basic equipment they so desperately need."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Encourage Guard Raids"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "The time for action is at hand. For weeks, we have been funneling the Iron Guard weapons, supplies, and even off the books advisors. It is well past time for them to put this all to good use. It's time to call in our favors and mobilize our allies; it's time to show the Monarchy that Fascism is back in style."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Teach Them How to War"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "There's no getting around it; the Romanian army isn't what it used to be. The hardened core of the army were mostly members of the Iron Guard, and many of the career soldiers likewise left when their comrades were declared traitors and blacklisted. The quality of Romania's troops has greatly suffered as a result; they desperately need professionals to help train their new recruits."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_5:0 "Spread Pro-Iron Guard Propaganda"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "\"The Heroes of Romania Fight On!\" It's not hard to spin the Iron Guard as romantic heroes, betrayed by a tyrannical Crown who only cares about its own wealth and wellbeing. We shall help create and distribute this propaganda with our various allies and connections throughout the country."

 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Send Missile Launchers"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The time to strike the Romanian army is now! The Guard and its allies are ready to strike and make a statement! All they lack is heavy weapons to deal with fortifications and heavy vehicles. Fortunately, we have a remedy for that..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Apply Economic Pressure"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "Our help is not free, or out of simple good will. Romania needs us, and we need them. However, we hold all of the cards, even if it costs us in the short term. Applying some pressure will remind them of this."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Help Organize Assaults"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Romania is a vast country with a plethora of terrains. The Iron Guard are very good planners, but could still use some help selecting targets of importance and organizing assaults. A few of our officers could certainly help them with this."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Hold Oil Assets Over Their Heads"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Romania is hopelessly dependent on their oil, which makes them dependent on our technology and equipment that is technically owned by us. Holding our assets over their head will force them to comply with our demands."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Siege Bucharest"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "The capital of Romania and the heart of the country, Bucharest, lies exposed! The city is huge and is a center of Monarchist support. Even with its poorly trained garrison, it would be a struggle to capture. That doesn't mean the Guard can't terrorize the population! If we send our friends enough weapons, they would have the means to put the city under siege. Even if it is temporary, the feat itself would be a huge boon for our allies."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Promise More Military Aid"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Even after all the help we've given them, the Romanian army is still under equipped and undertrained. If the Romanians decide to commit to aligning with us, we can offer further military aid in return."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Active Hidden Guard Cells in the Army"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "For years, Iron Guard loyalists have kept their heads down and continue to serve the Monarchy. With the influx of infiltrators in recent months, the various cells in the army now have enough manpower and influence to temporarily throw the entire army into disarray!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Scare the Administration"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "We aren't sure if the Romanians are aware of this or not, but if the Monarchy is going to survive, the Romanians will need our help. Radical Nazi terrorists and other right wingers are iching for a chance to strike against them government. They certainly will need our help, and should be \"gently\" reminded of this."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Sabotage Lines of Communication"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "Although Germany is technically neutral and favors no side in Romania, it is in our interests to see the Iron Guard succeed and overthrow the Monarchy. We could play a small role; infiltrating Romania with some of our agents, we can sabotage lines of communication all throughout the country and throw the administration into further disarray."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Threaten an Embargo"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_3_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "The Romanians are still not taking us seriously. They think that we are pushovers, and can take more and more without offering anything in return. This ends now; we will threaten a trade embargo to wake the government up and take us seriously."
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_6:0 "Occupy the Countryside"
 GreatGame_GER_game_3_turn_5_decision_6_desc:0 "The Romanian army is concentrated in the urban centers. It would be a trivial affair for the Iron Guard and its allies to occupy large swaths of the countryside with a little encouragement and extra equipment."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "On our side of the Italian-French border, defensive fortifications line the entire width of the frontiers. Build more out of preparation for Germany than France, the French still see it as overly aggressive on our part. We can demilitarize the border to try and appease the French."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Give French Units Autonomy"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Technically, the French chain of command is directly subservient to the Wermarcht. In practice, the lines of communication are cumbersome at best, and the French units have very little freedom to adapt to developing situations on the ground. Giving the French army more autonomy would both increase their effectiveness and win us some gratitude."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Relax Trade Sanctions"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "As an official dependent in the Pakt, our trading relations between the French and us are almost non-existent. We do know that the French are not a willing member, however. We can certainly make an exception for the French and relax our sanctions with them."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Get Accounts of Berbers Killing Frenchmen"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "There is a sizable minority or French citizens still living in Algeria under Italian administration. The French there have been subject to raids from local Berber tribesmen. The Italians ignore the violence, of course. There are more than a few accounts of this that we can collect and leak to the French."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Leak Pictures of Burgundian Work Camps"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "There are nearly no records or pictures of what goes on in Burgundy; just rumors and the rare first hand account. Yet somehow, either from an agent or French person who managed to escape, a small number of pictures of massive, town sized work and concentration camps have come into our possession. We could subtibly leak these to French newspapers to turn their opinions against the Reich and its lackeys."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Expose Italian Brutality in Corsica "
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The Italians like to point the finger at us when it comes to the treatment of French natives, but perhaps they should take a look at themselves. In Corsica, the French had been forced from the homes and now live in poverty. The best jobs have been taken by the Italians, and the French have little representation in government, to say nothing of the police violence and favoritism shown to the new Italian settlers. Perhaps we should remind France of this."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Interview Refugees from Burgundy"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The first hand accounts from those fortunate enough to cross the Burgundian-French borders are harrowing. Tales of entire cities transformed into massive work camps, blatant disregard for human life, SS brutality; the list is endless. These surrivor's stories need to be written down and distributed."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Make Up Rumors About Italian Ambitions"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Who is to say that Italy isn't looking for more land in Europe even now? The Italians are an untrustworthy lot who are quick to stab their \"friends\" in the back, as we're well aware of. Germany is the only thing standing between another invasion of France from those degenerates. Are they really? Likely not, but the French don't need to know that."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Obtain Stories of Abuse from Alsazia-Lorena"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "It isn't only the SS that are exploiting the French people. The population administered under Germany proper are treated no better than dogs. Many of them are enslaved, trapped in large work camps and forced to labor for the Nazi war machine. Their stories should not be forgotten and need to be told."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_4:0 "French \"Genocide\" in Syria"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "\"The French are being slaughtered in Syria!\" will be on headlines today! We need to portray Italy as an overlord indifferent to the conditions and fate of non-Italians. We are going to spin the story as if hundreds of Frenchmen are being assaulted and killed, even though in reality it was one drunk man who fell off a roof and died. Our media will omit that."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Expose the Blood Mines of Burgundy"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "One of Burgundy's more well kept secrets is its massive slave labor mining facilities dotted around their territory. The life expectancy of the average miner is dismissal; little to no safety procedures, child laborers, \"motivational shootings\"; the list is sickeningly endless. All of this comes from a lone escapie, who has told her story in a debrief when she was picked up at the border. The French will be furious with the Reich if we leak this to them."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_5:0 "Tally the Number of French Dead Or Missing"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_5_desc:0 "Some researchers in at Milan University asked themselves a simple question; how many French citizens have died since World War Two under Nazi occupation? Numbers are obviously hard to come by, but the initial results look... horrible. We  could sponsor these researches and distribute their work far and wide; in particular to France."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Send Trainers"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "The French army has virtually atrophied after more than two decades of virtual non-existence. France needs a new generation of professional soldiers, and their prospects as of now do not look good. We could send some much needed trainers to the French, which would help keep them tied to the Pakt."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Open an Embassy"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "If we are ever going to normalize relations with the French, we need to reopen our Embassy in Italy, as well as found a new one somewhere in France. This is an important first step in reestablishing a semblance of normalcy between us."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Gift the Army New Weapons"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Building up a new army is a lot of work, as the French are quickly finding out. Equipment shortages are crippling; we could assuage the pain and give the French army some of our surplus to help them out."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Negotiate a Trade Deal"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Our government has not had an official trade policy with the French state since before the Second World War. It is finally time to sit down with our neighbors and iron out an official agreement."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Send Over Interceptors"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The French Airforce is almost non-existent. This actually works out in our favor; it keeps the French dependent on us for protection. That said, they should have something in the event that air power is needed on short notice. It certainly wouldn't hurt to give the French a small number of our spare interceptors."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Host Small-Scale Wargames"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The Italian and French armies haven't really worked together since the 20s. As a show of goodwill and trust, we should host some small scale wargames so both their and our men can interact with each other and forge new bonds and a sense of comradery."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Host Naval Exercises"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The French aren't only focusing on their land forces; they have for years supported a small but efficient coast guard. Hosting some naval exercise costs us little and increases our cohesion and relations with the French."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Open Up the Borders"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Since our falling out with the Reich, the French-Italian border has been closed off, and only a chosen few are able to cross it. Open hostility with France is a thing of the past however; it is now time for us to loosen up and open up the border for travel."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5:0 "Artillery For the Army"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "The French army lacks heavy guns even more than they do for small arms. Regular French divisions pack nearly no punch as a result, and as it stands would be smashed in any conventional confrontation. Sending some of our surplus artillery pieces would be a huge help to the French forces."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6:0 "Send Over Support Equiment"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6_desc:0 "It's as if the French army has produced nothing for their men for two decades! Even the most basic equipment, like radios, is absent from their stockpiles. How their army even functions is beyond our understanding. Some basic support equipment would be put to good use by the French."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Release French Slaves From the Reich"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Italians are making a strong bid to win over the French. We can not be outdone by them; releasing French slaves that work in the Reich will counter Italian influence and help us repair our relations with France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Pay Compensation to French Citizens"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Many French natives within the Italian Empire have suffered injustice under our administration. Jobs, lands, wealth, and more have been taken from them forcibly and unjustly. Those that have lost asset unfairly should be compensated; this will improve our relations with France."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Buy Burgundian Slaves"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "One of our dirtier secrets is the goings on in Burgundy. Life even for Aryans is harsh; the SS squeeze all the value out of all life in that blasted hell hole. There are slaves that are too ill or weak for work that the Ordensstade does not care about; we can purchase these folks and set them free, returning them to France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Help the French Repair Refugee Camps"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Much preparation needs to be made before the expected wave of French immigrants arrive in France proper. We can send some engineers to France to assist in building temporary encampments for the newcomers."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Release French Prisoners"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands of French soldiers who fought against us in the Second World War are still rotting away in prison camps. Old, demoralized, and quite frankly a drain on resources, these men are literally good for nothing. Their final use can be propaganda; we can parole all of the survivors and send them back to France as a show of \"goodwill\"."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Assist French Corsican Resettlement"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "For over a decade, French citizens living on Corsica have chaffed under Italian administration. After the initial wave of Italian immigrants came and stole the best jobs from the natives, many have wanted to leave and head to the mainland to start anew."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Pay French Slaves \"Compensation\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Some of our recently freed slaves have worked for as long as two decades with little to no pay under brutal working conditions. We should offer them some token compensation to assuage their pain and to \"right wrongs\". Or rather, make the French State think we care. Same thing."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Assist French Algerian Resettlement"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "French Algeria has always been a harsh colony to survive in, and the change in administration has not been kind for the French community there. Thousands barely scrape by, having to fight both the environment and Berber tribesmen. Many would jump at the chance to board a boat back to France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5:0 "Assist French Syrian Resettlement"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "The French community in Syria has always been small. Comparatively privileged compared to other settlers, the French here has still lost many of the boons they once had when the Italian administration moved in. A good portion of them would be more than willing to make the return trip home to France if given the opportunity."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6:0 "Offer Mainland Frenchmen Opportunities to Move"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6_desc:0 "Although their living conditions are heads and shoulders above their compatriots in the colonies, many French citizens in our mainland European conquests have nonetheless not been thrilled to live under what they see as a foreign occupation. We know many are willing to leave for what remains of France; we only need to allow them to leave."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7:0 "Assist French Resettlement In East Africa"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7_desc:0 "Compared to their fellow countrymen in the other colonies, the few French living in East Africa have more or less continued to live a hard life in the harsh environment around the horn of Africa. Most of these settlers are poor and always have been. An opportunity to move to France, sponsored by the government no less will have many men jumping at the opportunity to finally leave the poor poverty stricken colony."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Fly Sorties over French Territory"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The French do not get to just \"up and leave\" the Pakt! They owe us subservience, and they're dependent on us for everything! They have nothing, and we'll remind them of that! Launching sorties all over their airspace will remind them of their helplessness!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Invest in the French Economy"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The French economy has been stagnant for over fifty years. The Great Depression, losing the Second World War, and then the market crash of the 50s has left them economically on their knees. The French economy needs a lot of help; any investments into their civilian economy would be greatly appreciated."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Organize Naval Maneuvers Off the French Coast"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Something France totally lacks is a navy. They can not project any power past their coasts; they simply don't have the ships to protect any of their shipping in any waters they operate in. We can intimidate them by sailing U-boats and surface ships in their waters as they watch helplessly."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Gift Them Tanks"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "German stipulations stipulated that the French could not operate their own armored formations. As a result, development of tanks in France has ground to a halt for two decades. Sending some of our own armor would help them form a small armored division for their own needs, under their own control."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Warn the French"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Sometimes, blunt words face to face is the simplest way to convey a message. Our message will be short; leave the Pakt and throw your lot in with the traitorous Italians, and there will be dire consequences."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Develop West Coast Ports"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "French docks have been seriously neglected. To make matters worse for them, their largest one in the north have been taken from them. Luckly, there are plenty of perfect locations on their west coast for potential, large dockyards."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Threaten Harsh Economic Sanctions"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "France's economy is totally dependent on our own. Nearly all of their trade is with us or other members of the Pakt, which we control. We can pressure France to stay their course with us by \"reminding\" them that their economy is totally tied to ours, and that trying to leave would be disastrous."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Send Over Surplus Trucks"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "The French army has a serious lack of motorized vehicles. This can not stand; a modern day army needs vehicles to function properly; whether that be for logistics or for frontline use. Sending the French surplus military trucks would undoubtedly make them quite grateful."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Equip Their Army"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "France's army is in a horrible state. Their men seriously lack every type of military equipment needed to even field foot divisions! Lack of rifles, artillery, uniforms, even boots! How do they even function? We should help them out at once."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_1:0 "Send Humanitarian Aid"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "The Refugee crisis in Serbia is, quite frankly, out of hand. Tens of thousands of Serbs live in massive tent cities jobless and poverty stricken. We are lucky the situation on the ground hasn't gotten out of hand yet. We need to do something to improve local conditions at once."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Fortify Our Outposts"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Some of our officers have finished their tours in Serbia and have recently come home. They bring with them some grim news; many of our deployed garrisons and outposts in the Serbian countryside lay dangerously exposed. It's a small miracle the rabble in the mountain hasn't exploited this yet; we should fortify our encampments at once!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Set Up Refugee Camps"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "The current camps for the Serbian immigrants are already well over capacity. We need to find suitable locations and help build new camps for the inevitable next wave of newcomers."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Send Over Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "It's hard to really blame our men in Serbia for not wiping out the various partisans fighting us in Siberia. Many of the garrisons have a critical lack of heavy guns. Considering that most of the rebel encampments are hidden deep in fortified mountain and forest strongholds, it's suicidal to just assault them without heavy firepower. Sending over more artillery pieces will be a real help."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Relax Border Restrictions"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands of Serbians have set up camp near the various border crossings into Serbia. These people have tried to make the journey across the border, but are stopped by our guards. It isn't their fault; they are only following orders, but the refugees are becoming restless, and the situation certainly won't impress Serbia. Allowing these people free passage though will calm things down in the region."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Create a \"Quick-Strike\" Force"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Our troops biggest issue is that they are not mobile. They have a limited range of operations which is centered around our major supply bases in the area. We could change the dynamic of the fighting by creating a specialized \"Quick-Strike\" force. These men would be airlifted via helicopter to an area we deem fit to send them at a moment's notice."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Help Serbs in Albania Move"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "The Serbians in Albania are basically trapped in a land that isn't really their own anymore. More and more Albanias are displacing the Serbian minority, and tensions are reaching the boiling point. Many would like to leave to start anew in Serbia, but don't have the funds or aren't able to cross the border without express permission. We can offer a one time deal to help them make the journey at our expense."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Work For Your Food!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Thousands of Serbians sit idle in despair, sucking up resources and not contributing to society. These people are basically unexploited resources, hungering for the chance to do some honest work for a little pay and food. It is well past time we step in and organize labor brigades and put these people back to work."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_1:0 "The Refugees Need Equipment!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Tents, clothes, bedding, soap, and more! The refugees in Serbia desperately need more of everything we can think of! We need to send supplies at once!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Build New Worker Camps"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The refugee camps are simply overcrowded and not optimized for large scale work projects. Building new, specialized work camps kills two birds with one stone; it greatly improves the living conditions of the workers while giving them an opportunity to work for pays."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Send Vehicles"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "There is a serious bottleneck on the poorly maintained Serbian roads; the antique vehicles that are currently being used by the various humanitarian agencies at work frequently break down, and to top it off can carry very little cargo. Sending some of our heavy duty military trucks would help out the situation on the ground a lot."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Fund Infrastructure Projects"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands still stand jobless and stuck in the refugee camps. Why not put them to work ourselves? We could personally fund a series of infrastructure construction projects; bridges, ditches, drainage systems, road construction, and more if we so choose."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Send Foodstuffs and Essentials"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "It isn't a secret; most of the refugees have nothing to their names except the clothes on their backs. As more and more people congregate to the camps, less and less food is available for all, and the incoming immigrants certainly aren't bringing more foodstuffs with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Introduce Ration Cards"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "Not every man, woman, and child will be able to get a steady job and be able to work their ways to a new home without support. We can help out the people on the ground by introducing ration cards; this will encourage the people to do menial work around the camp in exchange for extra goods, services, and even money."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Donate to the Red Cross"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "The men and women on the field, the doctors and nurses of the Red Cross are truly doing God's work in Serbia. Asking for no payments, these volunteers have been providing life saving services to the thousands of refugees in need. Our money would be well sent if we gave a donation to the Red Cross."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Loan Military Engineers"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "Engineers, especially for bridge building, are in high demand, and there aren't enough in Serbia to go around. We could send some of our experts from the army over to help design and build these projects in vital areas."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Find Nationalists in the Government"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "It is well known that there is much resentment towards the German occupation in the Serbian collaboration government. It wouldn't take much looking to feel out and find nationalists who would like to see nothing more than the Hun kicked out of Serbia."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Invest in the Civilian Economy"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Foreign investments in Serbia have been nearly non-existent for over a decade. The region is just not attractive to foreign interests, despite its potential. That is where we come in; some smart investments in the right sectors could help give the Serbian economy the boost it needs to get on its feet."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Inflitrate the Camps"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Getting eyes in the many refugee and work camps dotted around the countryside would be straightforward and easy. Serbian nationalist agitators like to sneak into these camps to rile up their countrymen. It would be simple enough to make contact with these men if we tried."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Improve Rail Lines"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Rail lines in Serbia are in a sorry state. Decay and disuse has taken its toll; the country has terribly few functioning lines, which is effectively a bottleneck for economic development. A concentrated effort to build and improve the rail lines would be a great stimulus boost for the local economy."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Scout Out the Countryside"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The bulk of the Serbian resistance hides out in the vast, rugged countryside of Serbia. Finding the partisans in their own backyard will not be an easy task, but it should be one that we undertake if we are going to establish connections with the anti-German elements there."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Hammer Out a Trade Deal"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The deal needs to be altered. Trade between us and Serbia is simply not profitable for either country; barely any goods flow between our two nations. We can change stipulations to get more German goods on their market, and in exchange we can buy raw materials like iron and coal for cheap. The Serbians will not be pleased to be forced into a trade treaty with no say, but it must be done."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Find Sleeper Cells in the Cities"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Discontent in the urban centers has simmered for a number of years. We know for a fact that there are nationalist cells underground around the country; we just don't know where. We could send our agents around to find them and make contact with these potential allies."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_5:0 "Sell Arms Licenses"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "Sebia has no domestic arms industry, so to speak. This is a shame, since there is much money to be made selling armaments. We could sell arms licenses to our allies, who could then use said license to turn a pretty penny in sales."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Form Air Cavalry"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Fighting against units who hit, then run into the woods is a royal pain. Raids against German and our collaborator allies are becoming more and more frequent; it has been proposed that in response, we form a specialized task force with unprecedented mobility to counter sudden threats. They would also be quite useful on the offensive..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Supply Nationalists With Arms"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Resistance in Serbia, on further analysis, is in a pitiful state. Only the most hardened and seasoned men have serviceable equipment; way too many of these \"freedom fighters\" are no more than men with sticks. A generous donation of rifles will make short work of this sorry state of affairs."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Reinforce Our Garrisons"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of our garrisons we've deployed to Serbia are equipped with second rate firearms and other tools. This is unacceptable! Proper German soldiers deserve only the best; these men should be given new guns at once!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Train the Guerillas"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Although there are a few partisans who have been fighting the Germans for over two decades, many of the fighters here are young, green, and haven't seen any fighting apart from taking pot-shots from the woods. They wouldn't stand up to a Russian mob, let alone trained soldiers from the Wehrmacht. These fighters need some serious training."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Ship in Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Our men on the field don't have the punch to really give the rebels they fight a good bashing. Our garrisons are assaulted again and again, but we don't have the firepower to make such assaults really punishing. That changes now; heavy artillery will change that dynamic in no time.  "
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Smuggle in Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The Germans operate armored cars throughout the region as mobile patrol units. German garrisons are likewise hardened fortifications; assaulting these compounds and patrols is suicidal. Or rather, it is without any heavy ordnance. We certainly have plenty missile launchers laying around; why not send some of them where they can be put to good use?"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Send more Men!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Ever since we've started our occupation of Serbia, the garrison has always lacked the necessary manpower to properly garrison the small country. This has finally come to haunt us, and now we're dealing with multiple organized resistance groups. We must send more men if we are going to keep our hold on the country."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Provide Explosives to Urban Partisans"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Satchel charges are super destructive and can do a ton of damage in the right hands. These have limited impact in the country however, but in an urban setting, large explosions are perfect for sowing terror..."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_5:0 "Attach an Air Squadron"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "One of our key advantages we have over any partisan group that resists the Reich is total air superiority. Why Serbia hasn't been deemed important enough to warrant a small attachment is beyond us, but it's better late than never that we send some planes. These would be a huge help in fighting the rabbles in the forests."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_6:0 "Get Our Men Tanks"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_6_desc:0 "It is an expensive investment, but also a practicable one. There is no way untrained partisans can stand up to and fight a Panzer formation, much less disable one. A small panzer formation is just what our garrisons need to keep the rebels on their toes, and make them think twice before attacking us."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Spread Anti-Italian Propaganda"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The Italians are the true enemies of the Serbian peoples. It is the Italians, not us, who keep the Serb peoples from being united in one country. It is the Italians, not us, who caused the massive refugee crisis and forced tens of thousands to flee to the last free place the Serbains can call home. We sure won't let them forget it."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Spread Anti-German Propaganda"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "It is the Germans who have made Serbia the poverty stricken rump state it is today. They care not for anyone but themselves, and only occupy Serbia so they can drain it of all its life blood. They're rapists and killers, and everyone should know."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Give More Handouts to Refugees"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of the refugees are becoming restless. This isn't a huge concern, but it still makes our administration look bad. We could temporarily placate them by giving most upset refugees some extra supplies, and maybe even a few luxuries."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Spread Nationalist Rhetoric"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "The Serbs are a great people. Always steadfast in defense of their country, they aren't afraid to face off against the odds for their people and homes, and today is no different. All Serbians rise up! We will throw out the Germans!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Expose the Race War in Albania"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Hundreds of Serbs have been killed in Albania this last decade, and thousands more forced to flee for their lives while the Italians watched. For all our shortcomings, we haven't allowed state sanctioned genocide to occur here; lets let the people know that the Italians aren't heroes."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Rile Up the Refugees"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Poor, dirty, hungry, and trapped, the refugee camps are a literal ticking time bomb before they explode into rioting. The Germans are still keeping immigrants and refugees in the camps, often against their will. It wouldn't take much to rile up these angry people."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Improve Conditions in the Camps"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Many of our camps are still overfilled. Shortages of everything, from boots to medical supplies are in short supply. The Serbian refugees need a large amount of goods, and we can easily supply them if we so choose."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Sit Down With the Resistance"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "The many resistance groups of Serbia, while brave, do not work well together. It's a shame; a united front against the Germans would be a force to be reckoned with. We should gather the various groups into a room and help them iron out their differences. If we could get them to work together; the partisans as a whole would be much more dangerous and effective."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Praise German Generosity!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "\"The Serbians have flourished under our administration! German generosity has seen the state rise from a rabble run Communist wasteland to a glorious, independent state! They still have a ways to go, of course, but the Serbains have come far under German direction!\""
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Expose Horrid Work Camp Conditions"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "It's even worse than we thought. The Serbian \"work camps\" more resemble the disgusting concentration camps from World War II than a public works program to help get hard workers up on their feet. The rest of Serbia needs to see what the Germans are doing to their countrymen!"
