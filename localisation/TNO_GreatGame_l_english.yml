 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "If we are to subvert the Germans and break Bulgaria away from the Reich's influence, we need eyes on the ground. Information wins wars; we need to be in the know on the ground at all times."

For now, this is to our advantage; we can buy connections in the Fatherland Front with the guns that they desperately need."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_4:0 "신 불가리아인"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Germans can not make up the bulk of the Bulgarian security forces; we simply don't have the means. Therefore, we should start a small propaganda campaign to increase political support for their government so they can stabilize their country themselves."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_1:0 "가짜 \"폭동\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "The Fatherland Front needs to be put down once and for all. This will never happen if the common Bulgarian is totally indifferent to this group of traitors.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_1:0 "전선 단원들을 위한 가짜 신분증"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Many of the members of the underground Fatherland Front have been blacklisted and are forced to hide underground. We can help out our newfound allies by creating them new identifications and birth certificates. Bulgaria is notorious for its backwardness; we shall use this to our advantage!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_2:0 "조국전선에게 공격 누명 씌우기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The biggest threat to our influence in Bulgaria is by far the Fatherland Front. If these partisans have been a constant thorn in our side; if we were to turn the population against them by making them out as brigades, it could increase our popularity in the region."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_2:0 "전선으로 군복 밀수"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "If our allies look the part, there is a good chance we could plant Fatherland Front members into the lower echelons of the Bulgarian army. Their role calls are a mess, and some quickly forged \"redeployment orders\" with the proper equipment could enable us to quickly infiltrate the army."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_3:0 "불 붙이기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "If we want to scare the public, the perfect target would be an important government office in Sofia. Our men already guard many of these buildings; it would be simple to light one on fire ourselves and present a Fatherland Front bandit as the perpetrator..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_3:0 "불가리아 참모 교란"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "The Bulgarian's do keep a close eye on their army, as much as it pains us to admit it. It is troublesome for some of our allies in the Front to infiltrate the Bulgarian army. We could create a distraction in their General Staff by flexing our military might by sponsoring a series of small scale wargames in Albania."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_4:0 "주둔군 동원"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "The Bulgarians are still not declaring a State of Emergency. Mobilizing our men would likely be sufficient to scare the government enough and push them the extra step that we need, but it would sour our relations with them."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_4:0 "사면 로비"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "To take Bulgaria's eyes off of their internal security temporarily, we could send an Italian delegation to demand the legalization of the various political parties that make up the Fatherland Front, as well as amnesty for all of the Front's members. The Bulgarians will, of course, not agree to this. These demands will be seen as totally unacceptable, but it will give our friends the cover they need to infiltrate the army."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1:0 "분견대 무장"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "The Front has become increasingly troublesome. Any security personal in the field in Bulgaria should get a rifle; the Bulgarians would be indebted to us once again if we send them more arms."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_1:0 "정부와의 연락망 동원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "We need to get into direct contract with Tsar Simeon. By utilizing our local contacts, we can circumvent the Germans and their lap dogs."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_2:0 "선전작전 개시"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Support for the Tsar has continued to wane. We need to turn public perception around and portray him as the father figure the country needs."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_2:0 "반독성향 관료 식별"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Not all Bulgarians in government are Nazi stooges. We need to find the men loyal to the Tsar and identify them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_3:0 "\"도적\" 소탕"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Fatherland Front members are nothing more than bandits! We're going to send out our garrison in Sofia and hunt them down."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_3:0 "충성파가 근위대에 잠입하도록 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Part of the reason it's so hard for us to make contact with the Tsar is that he is surrounded by Germans and their collaborator lackeys. If we funnel loyalists in the army supplies, we could get friends close to the Tsar."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4:0 "항공 정찰"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Our enemies hide deep in the countryside. If we are going to hunt them down like the rats they are, we need to locate them. Luckily, the Luftwaffe is more than adequate for this task."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1:0 "시메온 가택연금"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Our intelligence agents have tipped us off that the Italians are trying to get into direct contact with Tsar Simeon. Under no circumstances can we let this happen. We will send a regiment of our garrison to Simeon's house and serve as his guards for the time being, whether the Bulgarians like it or not."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_1:0 "조국전선 무장"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "It is time for the people of Bulgaria to fight for their freedom! Any man willing to fight for freedom from the Nazi hegemony should be given a rifle!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "반대파 협박"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "During this political turmoil, some of the Tsar's own advisors have come out of the woodworks to voice their \"concerns\". We aren't fooled; the administration is testing the waters and trying to rally support. This is unacceptable; we need to put them back in their places."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "소문 퍼뜨리기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "SS가 차르를 독살했다! 히틀러가 반대파를 납치해 죽음의 수용소로 보낸다! 독일 주둔군이 정부에게 총을 겨누고 협박한다! 사실이던 아니던 별 상관 없습니다. 우린 민중이 분노해 라이히에 맞서 일어나기만을 바랍니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "불가리아군 지원 획득"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "We have more than a few friends in the Bulgarian military. It's time to call in our favors with our allies there and get their badge of approval. The Bulgarian military's support could be decisive in the coming days."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "시위자 격려"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The people's will must be known! The Tsar does not stand alone against the Germans; the people chafe against their occupiers. Encouraging people to rally together in the streets will show the Germans that they are not wanted in Bulgaria!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "중립파 관료에게 뇌물 먹이기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "There are more than a few administrators in the Bulgarian government who are on the fence, so to speak. While not outright hostile to our influence, we wouldn't consider them exactly friendly either. Some cash to show our appreciation for all their hard work would win more than a few of these neutrals over to our cause."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "독일 초소 공격"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Our allies don't have the means to directly assault German complexes yet. Small groups of Italian special operatives can be sent to Bulgaria to hit German fortifications and shake our arrogant foe's morale."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1:0 "주둔군 배치"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "A huge wave of protesters and traitors are rising up in Sofia! If not dealt with swiftly, these people could threaten our dominance in Bulgaria. This must be stopped at once; deploy our garrison!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_1:0 "봉기 조직 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The Fatherland Front is nearly ready to take back their capital! However, they have no real plan other than to take to the streets en mass. This will not do; we shall send some of our professional army staff officers to help them plan the uprising."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "알려진 지도자 체포"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to the Bulgarian administration, our intelligence agents have a list of known Fatherland Front members; a number of them which are key organizers in the party. Arresting these organizers and leaders will throw this \"uprising\" into disarray."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "독일 주둔군 교란"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "The biggest obstacle the uprising is going to face is the hardened German garrison in Sofia. If we send some of our own men in plain clothes to hit the German's logistics, we could potentially draw a large number of them out of the city on a fruitless chase through the countryside."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "차르를 소피아에서 빼내기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "The Tsar is proving to be problematic. He himself is not keen on continued German influence in Bulgaria, and an endorsement of this rebellion by him could prove disastrous. For his own \"security\" and \"safety\", we could move him out of the city temporarily."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "대중 무장시키기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "To no surprise, a large number of the common folks in Sofia are sick and tired of the rampant German dominance of their country. Arming these people would greatly increase the revolt's chances of success."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "무장한 시위꾼에게 사격"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Armed mobs have taken to the streets. The situation is tense, but no street fighting has broken out... yet. We can not tolerate such open defiance; any citizen wielding a firearm shall be shot on sight by our men!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "할 수 있는 모든 부탁"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Bulgarians in government positions all over the country owe us favors. Police chiefs, army officers, administrators and more owe us, and there's no better time to collect our favors than now."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "증원군 요청"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "It's clear; we don't have enough German boots on the ground to contain this uprising. We need more men in the field if we are going to remain in control of Sofia."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "군 내 점조직 활동 개시"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "During the last couple of months, we've gotten a number of Fatherland Front agents into the Bulgarian Army. It's time to activate these agents to sow confusion and disarray in the rank. This will slow down their response times, and give the uprising a better chance at success."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "Though our relationship with Hungary has soured over the decade, we still have a number of friends in high places from the glory days of the Reich. Reconnecting with them would be a good first step towards mending our relationship with them."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1:0 "이탈리아 대표단 파견"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "It has been nearly a decade since an Italian delegation has been sent to Hungary. If we want to repair our damaged relations with them, we need to send some of our higher ranker officials to show that we're serious, and want to work with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "화살십자당 후원"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "During the Second World War, the best of all the Hungarians were part of the Arrow Cross party. Ferociously nationalistic and aware of the danger of Eternal Jew, the Arrow Cross is the Hungarian equivalent of the Nazi party. They are our natural allies, and are worthy of our funding. Their gratitude will be well worth the cost."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "헝가리 대사관 재개장"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Ever since our relations with Germany collapsed in the 50s, the Hungarian embassy has been closed due to their alignment with Germany. Times have changed, however. Reopening the embassy would be a good first step to establishing our ties with the Hungarian government."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "준군사조직 훈련"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Paramilitaries in Hungary are almost exclusively nationalistic patriots aghast at Hungary's embarrassing defeats in the 50s. These men would be thrilled and indebted to us if we help train these zealous patriots."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "좋은 무역협정 제안"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Trade between the Italian and Hungarian markets is almost non-existent at the moment. We can change this by offering the Hungarian government favorable import and export rates to encourage more trade."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4:0 "독일의 제한 무시"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Technically, the Reich has a plethora of trade and diplomatic restrictions in place that any foreign countries need to deal with when trying to establish relations with a member of their so called \"Pakt\". In reality, these restrictions are nothing more than formalities. We can safely ignore them at the expense of our already deteriorating relations with the Reich."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_1:0 "요원 배치"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 ""The German minority along the Danube is rather sizable. The Hungarian government tends to leave those who pay their taxes alone, and Aryans are certainly no expectation. A few more German faces amongst the crowds won't raise suspicions..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_1:0 "헝가리 외교관을 위한 호화로운 파티"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "For the first time in a decade, Hungarian diplomats occupy an embassy in Rome! This calls for celebration! We are going to throw a huge party to celebrate this momentous occasion."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_2:0 "가족 관계 활용"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of our citizens within the Reich have family connections with our brothers in Hungary. We can use these ties to our advantage; the loyal Aryans to our south would like nothing more than to see a pro-Reich government in power, and will be more than happy to work with our agents."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_2:0 "행정부 칭찬"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "Considering the hand they were dealt, so to speak, Hungary's current administration has done an admirable job this last decade keeping the country together and stable. Acknowledging this will strengthen our relations with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_3:0 "지역민 뇌물 먹이기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Many Hungarian Germans are sadly apathetic to our cause, and won't assist our agents and spies out of their good will or patriotism. Though disappointing and unbecoming of true Germans, this isn't an issue money can't solve."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "Our hold over France has been loosening for years now. More all intents and purposes, the French have been ignoring the military restrictions placed upon them for a few years now. By officially ending these restrictions, we save face and win over the French."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_1:0 "이탈리아의 약속"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "The French are wary to even talk to us. They fear that we still have ambitions for more of their lands in Southern France. If we are going to establish ties, we need to let them know that Italy has no more ambitions in France."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_2:0 "부르군트 억제 약속"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "The biggest threat to French sovereignty is the rouge SS state of Burgundy. We can reassure the French that we will reign them in and keep Himmler in check. Many of our advisors have pointed out that no one will buy this, and that the posturing isn't worth it, but we would win some favor with the French if we did so."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_2:0 "친선사절단"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Our relationship with France has been abysmal ever since the Second World War. It's time to patch things up. We should send a diplomatic mission to start repairing our relations."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_3:0 "국경수비대 무장 지원"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "The French army is woefully under equipped. Many of their units are still using military surplus from the Great War, while the Italian army sits on their doorstep with a modern army! This will not do; the border guards need some new equipment."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_3:0 "국경 비무장지대"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "On our side of the Italian-French border, defensive fortifications line the entire width of the frontiers. Build more out of preparation for Germany than France, the French still see it as overly aggressive on our part. We can demilitarize the border to try and appease the French."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_4:0 "프랑스군 부대 자율권"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Technically, the French chain of command is directly subservient to the Wehrmacht. In practice, the lines of communication are cumbersome at best, and the French units have very little freedom to adapt to developing situations on the ground. Giving the French army more autonomy would both increase their effectiveness and win us some gratitude."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_4:0 "무역 제재 완화"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "As an official dependent in the Pakt, our trading relations between the French and us are almost non-existent. We do know that the French are not a willing member, however. We can certainly make an exception for the French and relax our sanctions with them."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_1:0 "유출된 부르군트 노동수용소 사진"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "부르군트에서 무슨 일이 보여주는지 알려줄 녹음이나 기록은 거의 없습니다. 대부분이 루머고 직접적인 이야기는 적죠. 하지만 요원이나 탈출에 성공한 프랑스인이 전한 소수의 사진이 있습니다. 마을 크기의 노동수용소가 찍힌 이 사진들이 우리 손 안에 들어왔습니다. 우리는 이 사진을 프랑스 신문에게 은근슬쩍 흘려서 라이히와 그 하인들에 대한 프랑스인의 의견을 바꿀 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_2:0 "이탈리아의 코르시카 내 잔혹행위 폭로"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "이탈리아인은 프랑스 원주민 대우 얘기가 나올 때마다 우릴 손가락질하려 합니다. 하지만 놈들도 자기가 어땠는지 따져봐야 할 것 같군요. 코르시카에서 프랑스인들은 집에서 쫓겨나 빈곤 속에 살고 있습니다. 좋은 일들은 이탈리아인이 가져갔고 프랑스인은 정부에서 별로 큰 목소리를 내지 못합니다. 경찰의 폭력과 이탈리아 정착민에 대한 불평등 대우에도 아무말도 하지 못하죠. 프랑스인들이 이걸 떠올리게 해야할 것 같습니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_2:0 "부르군트 난민과의 인터뷰"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "부르군트-프랑스 국경을 넘은 행운아에게서 직접 들은 이야기는 끔찍했습니다. 대규모 노동수용소로 변한 도시들, 인간 생명에 대한 노골적인 무시, SS의 잔혹행위. 목록을 만들자니 목록이 끝나지 않습니다. 이 생존자의 이야기를 써서 배포해야겠습니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_3:0 "이탈리아 야욕에 대해 소문 꾸미기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "이제 이탈리아 유럽에서 더 많은 땅을 원치 않는다고 누가 말할 수 있을까요? 이탈리아는 믿을 수 없는 놈들입니다. 우리가 잘 알다시피 놈들은 \"친구들\"의 등을 찌르는 일이라면 부리나케 하죠. 그 퇴락한 놈들이 프랑스를 또다시 침공하지 않게 막고 있는 것은 독일 뿐입니다. 진짜냐고요? 아니겠죠. 하지만 프랑스인이 그걸 알 필요는 없습니다."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "프랑스인을 착취하는 것은 SS만이 아닙니다. 독일이 제대로 다스리고 있는 이들도 개랑 다를바 없는 취급을 받습니다. 이들 중 많은 이들이 노예화되어 대규모 노동수용소에 갇힌 채 나치 전쟁기계를 위해 일하기를 강요받습니다. 이들의 이야기가 잊혀져서는 안됩니다. 누군가 말해야 합니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_4:0 "시리아에서 벌어진 프랑스인 \"인종학살\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "오늘 신문 1면은 이겁니다! \"시리아에서 프랑스인이 도살당한다!\" 이탈리아를 비이탈리아인의 상황과 최후에 무관심한 군주로 묘사할 필요가 있습니다. 우리는 수백명의 프랑스인이 두들겨맞고 살해당한 것처럼 기사를 내놓을 것입니다. 실제로는 한 명이 술에 취해 지붕에서 떨어져 죽은거라도 말입니다. 우리 언론은 이를 생략할 것입니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_4:0 "공포의 부르군트 광산 폭로"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "부르군트의 제일 잘 감춰진 비밀 중 하나는 국토에 별처럼 박힌 대규모 노예노동 채굴시설입니다. 평균적인 광부의 기대 수명은 말할 필요도 없습니다. 안전 수칙은 거의 없고, 아동 노동이 있고, \"동기부여성 사격\"도 있고. 이딴 목록이 역겨울 정도로 길게 있습니다. 이 모든 것이 탈출자 단 한 명에게서 나왔습니다. 그녀는 국경에서 구조될 때 자신의 이야기를 짧게 말했습니다. 우리가 이걸 프랑스인들에게 퍼뜨린다면 프랑스인은 라이히에게 분노할 것입니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_5:0 "프랑스 사망자 및 실종자 집계"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_2_decision_5_desc:0 "밀라노 대학교의 연구자 몇 명이 간단한 질문을 했습니다. 제2차 세계 대전 이후 나치 지배 하에서 얼마나 많은 프랑스 시민이 죽었을까? 확실히 집계하기는 어려운 수지만 초기 결과는...끔찍했습니다. 이 연구자들을 후원하고 이들의 작품을 널리 퍼뜨려야 합니다. 특히 프랑스에 말입니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_1:0 "교관 파견"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "The French army has virtually atrophied after more than two decades of virtual non-existence. France needs a new generation of professional soldiers, and their prospects as of now do not look good. We could send some much needed trainers to the French, which would help keep them tied to the Pakt."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_1:0 "대사관 개장"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "If we are ever going to normalize relations with the French, we need to reopen our Embassy in Italy, as well as found a new one somewhere in France. This is an important first step in reestablishing a semblance of normalcy between us."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_2:0 "새 무기 선물"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Building up a new army is a lot of work, as the French are quickly finding out. Equipment shortages are crippling; we could assuage the pain and give the French army some of our surplus to help them out."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_2:0 "무역협정 협상"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Our government has not had an official trade policy with the French state since before the Second World War. It is finally time to sit down with our neighbors and iron out an official agreement."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_3:0 "요격기 보내기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The French Airforce is almost non-existent. This actually works out in our favor; it keeps the French dependent on us for protection. That said, they should have something in the event that air power is needed on short notice. It certainly wouldn't hurt to give the French a small number of our spare interceptors."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3:0 "소규모 워게임 주최"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The Italian and French armies haven't really worked together since the 20s. As a show of goodwill and trust, we should host some small scale wargames so both their and our men can interact with each other and forge new bonds and a sense of comradery."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4:0 "해군 훈련 주최"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The French aren't only focusing on their land forces; they have for years supported a small but efficient coast guard. Hosting some naval exercise costs us little and increases our cohesion and relations with the French."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_4:0 "국경 개방"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Since our falling out with the Reich, the French-Italian border has been closed off, and only a chosen few are able to cross it. Open hostility with France is a thing of the past however; it is now time for us to loosen up and open up the border for travel."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5:0 "육군을 위한 화포"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "The French army lacks heavy guns even more than they do for small arms. Regular French divisions pack nearly no punch as a result, and as it stands would be smashed in any conventional confrontation. Sending some of our surplus artillery pieces would be a huge help to the French forces."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6:0 "지원장비 보내기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6_desc:0 "It's as if the French army has produced nothing for their men for two decades! Even the most basic equipment, like radios, is absent from their stockpiles. How their army even functions is beyond our understanding. Some basic support equipment would be put to good use by the French."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "라이히에서 프랑스인 노예 해방"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Italians are making a strong bid to win over the French. We can not be outdone by them; releasing French slaves that work in the Reich will counter Italian influence and help us repair our relations with France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "프랑스 시민들에게 배상"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Many French natives within the Italian Empire have suffered injustice under our administration. Jobs, lands, wealth, and more have been taken from them forcibly and unjustly. Those that have lost asset unfairly should be compensated; this will improve our relations with France."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_2:0 "부르군트 노예 구매"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "One of our dirtier secrets is the goings on in Burgundy. Life even for Aryans is harsh; the SS squeeze all the value out of all life in that blasted hell hole. There are slaves that are too ill or weak for work that the Ordensstaat does not care about; we can purchase these folks and set them free, returning them to France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_2:0 "프랑스의 난민 수용소 보수 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Much preparation needs to be made before the expected wave of French immigrants arrive in France proper. We can send some engineers to France to assist in building temporary encampments for the newcomers."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_3:0 "프랑스 포로 해방"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands of French soldiers who fought against us in the Second World War are still rotting away in prison camps. Old, demoralized, and quite frankly a drain on resources, these men are literally good for nothing. Their final use can be propaganda; we can parole all of the survivors and send them back to France as a show of \"goodwill\"."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3:0 "프랑스계 코르시카인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "For over a decade, French citizens living on Corsica have chaffed under Italian administration. After the initial wave of Italian immigrants came and stole the best jobs from the natives, many have wanted to leave and head to the mainland to start anew."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "프랑스인 노예 \"배상\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Some of our recently freed slaves have worked for as long as two decades with little to no pay under brutal working conditions. We should offer them some token compensation to assuage their pain and to \"right wrongs\". Or rather, make the French State think we care. Same thing."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "프랑스계 알제리인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "French Algeria has always been a harsh colony to survive in, and the change in administration has not been kind for the French community there. Thousands barely scrape by, having to fight both the environment and Berber tribesmen. Many would jump at the chance to board a boat back to France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5:0 "프랑스계 시리아인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "The French community in Syria has always been small. Comparatively privileged compared to other settlers, the French here has still lost many of the boons they once had when the Italian administration moved in. A good portion of them would be more than willing to make the return trip home to France if given the opportunity."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6:0 "본토 프랑스인에게 이주 기회 제안"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6_desc:0 "Although their living conditions are heads and shoulders above their compatriots in the colonies, many French citizens in our mainland European conquests have nonetheless not been thrilled to live under what they see as a foreign occupation. We know many are willing to leave for what remains of France; we only need to allow them to leave."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7:0 "동아프리카 프랑스인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7_desc:0 "Compared to their fellow countrymen in the other colonies, the few French living in East Africa have more or less continued to live a hard life in the harsh environment around the horn of Africa. Most of these settlers are poor and always have been. An opportunity to move to France, sponsored by the government no less will have many men jumping at the opportunity to finally leave the poor poverty stricken colony."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_1:0 "프랑스 영토 위로 편대 출격"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The French do not get to just \"up and leave\" the Pakt! They owe us subservience, and they're dependent on us for everything! They have nothing, and we'll remind them of that! Launching sorties all over their airspace will remind them of their helplessness!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1:0 "프랑스 경제 투자"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The French economy has been stagnant for over fifty years. The Great Depression, losing the Second World War, and then the market crash of the 50s has left them economically on their knees. The French economy needs a lot of help; any investments into their civilian economy would be greatly appreciated."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "프랑스 해안에서 해군 훈련"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Something France totally lacks is a navy. They can not project any power past their coasts; they simply don't have the ships to protect any of their shipping in any waters they operate in. We can intimidate them by sailing U-boats and surface ships in their waters as they watch helplessly."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "전차 선물"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "German stipulations stipulated that the French could not operate their own armored formations. As a result, development of tanks in France has ground to a halt for two decades. Sending some of our own armor would help them form a small armored division for their own needs, under their own control."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_3:0 "프랑스인에게 경고"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Sometimes, blunt words face to face is the simplest way to convey a message. Our message will be short; leave the Pakt and throw your lot in with the traitorous Italians, and there will be dire consequences."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3:0 "서해안 항구 개발"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "French docks have been seriously neglected. To make matters worse for them, their largest one in the north have been taken from them. Luckily, there are plenty of perfect locations on their west coast for potential, large dockyards."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_4:0 "가혹한 경제제재 협박"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "France's economy is totally dependent on our own. Nearly all of their trade is with us or other members of the Pakt, which we control. We can pressure France to stay their course with us by \"reminding\" them that their economy is totally tied to ours, and that trying to leave would be disastrous."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_4:0 "남아도는 트럭 보내기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "The French army has a serious lack of motorized vehicles. This can not stand; a modern day army needs vehicles to function properly; whether that be for logistics or for frontline use. Sending the French surplus military trucks would undoubtedly make them quite grateful."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_5:0 "프랑스군 무장시키기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "France's army is in a horrible state. Their men seriously lack every type of military equipment needed to even field foot divisions! Lack of rifles, artillery, uniforms, even boots! How do they even function? We should help them out at once."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_1:0 "Send Humanitarian Aid"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "The Refugee crisis in Serbia is, quite frankly, out of hand. Tens of thousands of Serbs live in massive tent cities jobless and poverty stricken. We are lucky the situation on the ground hasn't gotten out of hand yet. We need to do something to improve local conditions at once."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Fortify Our Outposts"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Some of our officers have finished their tours in Serbia and have recently come home. They bring with them some grim news; many of our deployed garrisons and outposts in the Serbian countryside lay dangerously exposed. It's a small miracle the rabble in the mountain hasn't exploited this yet; we should fortify our encampments at once!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_2:0 "Set Up Refugee Camps"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "The current camps for the Serbian immigrants are already well over capacity. We need to find suitable locations and help build new camps for the inevitable next wave of newcomers."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Send Over Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "It's hard to really blame our men in Serbia for not wiping out the various partisans fighting us in Siberia. Many of the garrisons have a critical lack of heavy guns. Considering that most of the rebel encampments are hidden deep in fortified mountain and forest strongholds, it's suicidal to just assault them without heavy firepower. Sending over more artillery pieces will be a real help."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_3:0 "Relax Border Restrictions"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands of Serbians have set up camp near the various border crossings into Serbia. These people have tried to make the journey across the border, but are stopped by our guards. It isn't their fault; they are only following orders, but the refugees are becoming restless, and the situation certainly won't impress Serbia. Allowing these people free passage though will calm things down in the region."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Create a \"Quick-Strike\" Force"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Our troops biggest issue is that they are not mobile. They have a limited range of operations which is centered around our major supply bases in the area. We could change the dynamic of the fighting by creating a specialized \"Quick-Strike\" force. These men would be airlifted via helicopter to an area we deem fit to send them at a moment's notice."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_4:0 "Help Serbs in Albania Move"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "The Serbians in Albania are basically trapped in a land that isn't really their own anymore. More and more Albanians are displacing the Serbian minority, and tensions are reaching the boiling point. Many would like to leave to start anew in Serbia, but don't have the funds or aren't able to cross the border without express permission. We can offer a one time deal to help them make the journey at our expense."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_1:0 "Work For Your Food!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Thousands of Serbians sit idle in despair, sucking up resources and not contributing to society. These people are basically unexploited resources, hungering for the chance to do some honest work for a little pay and food. It is well past time we step in and organize labor brigades and put these people back to work."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_1:0 "The Refugees Need Equipment!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Tents, clothes, bedding, soap, and more! The refugees in Serbia desperately need more of everything we can think of! We need to send supplies at once!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Build New Worker Camps"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The refugee camps are simply overcrowded and not optimized for large scale work projects. Building new, specialized work camps kills two birds with one stone; it greatly improves the living conditions of the workers while giving them an opportunity to work for pays."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Send Vehicles"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "There is a serious bottleneck on the poorly maintained Serbian roads; the antique vehicles that are currently being used by the various humanitarian agencies at work frequently break down, and to top it off can carry very little cargo. Sending some of our heavy duty military trucks would help out the situation on the ground a lot."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Fund Infrastructure Projects"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands still stand jobless and stuck in the refugee camps. Why not put them to work ourselves? We could personally fund a series of infrastructure construction projects; bridges, ditches, drainage systems, road construction, and more if we so choose."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Send Foodstuffs and Essentials"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "It isn't a secret; most of the refugees have nothing to their names except the clothes on their backs. As more and more people congregate to the camps, less and less food is available for all, and the incoming immigrants certainly aren't bringing more foodstuffs with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Introduce Ration Cards"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "Not every man, woman, and child will be able to get a steady job and be able to work their ways to a new home without support. We can help out the people on the ground by introducing ration cards; this will encourage the people to do menial work around the camp in exchange for extra goods, services, and even money."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Donate to the Red Cross"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "The men and women on the field, the doctors and nurses of the Red Cross are truly doing God's work in Serbia. Asking for no payments, these volunteers have been providing life saving services to the thousands of refugees in need. Our money would be well sent if we gave a donation to the Red Cross."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Loan Military Engineers"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "Engineers, especially for bridge building, are in high demand, and there aren't enough in Serbia to go around. We could send some of our experts from the army over to help design and build these projects in vital areas."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Find Nationalists in the Government"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "It is well known that there is much resentment towards the German occupation in the Serbian collaboration government. It wouldn't take much looking to feel out and find nationalists who would like to see nothing more than the Hun kicked out of Serbia."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Invest in the Civilian Economy"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Foreign investments in Serbia have been nearly non-existent for over a decade. The region is just not attractive to foreign interests, despite its potential. That is where we come in; some smart investments in the right sectors could help give the Serbian economy the boost it needs to get on its feet."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Infiltrate the Camps"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Getting eyes in the many refugee and work camps dotted around the countryside would be straightforward and easy. Serbian nationalist agitators like to sneak into these camps to rile up their countrymen. It would be simple enough to make contact with these men if we tried."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Improve Rail Lines"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Rail lines in Serbia are in a sorry state. Decay and disuse has taken its toll; the country has terribly few functioning lines, which is effectively a bottleneck for economic development. A concentrated effort to build and improve the rail lines would be a great stimulus boost for the local economy."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Scout Out the Countryside"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The bulk of the Serbian resistance hides out in the vast, rugged countryside of Serbia. Finding the partisans in their own backyard will not be an easy task, but it should be one that we undertake if we are going to establish connections with the anti-German elements there."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Hammer Out a Trade Deal"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The deal needs to be altered. Trade between us and Serbia is simply not profitable for either country; barely any goods flow between our two nations. We can change stipulations to get more German goods on their market, and in exchange we can buy raw materials like iron and coal for cheap. The Serbians will not be pleased to be forced into a trade treaty with no say, but it must be done."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Find Sleeper Cells in the Cities"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Discontent in the urban centers has simmered for a number of years. We know for a fact that there are nationalist cells underground around the country; we just don't know where. We could send our agents around to find them and make contact with these potential allies."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_5:0 "Sell Arms Licenses"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "Serbia has no domestic arms industry, so to speak. This is a shame, since there is much money to be made selling armaments. We could sell arms licenses to our allies, who could then use said license to turn a pretty penny in sales."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Form Air Cavalry"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Fighting against units who hit, then run into the woods is a royal pain. Raids against German and our collaborator allies are becoming more and more frequent; it has been proposed that in response, we form a specialized task force with unprecedented mobility to counter sudden threats. They would also be quite useful on the offensive..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Supply Nationalists With Arms"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Resistance in Serbia, on further analysis, is in a pitiful state. Only the most hardened and seasoned men have serviceable equipment; way too many of these \"freedom fighters\" are no more than men with sticks. A generous donation of rifles will make short work of this sorry state of affairs."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Reinforce Our Garrisons"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of our garrisons we've deployed to Serbia are equipped with second rate firearms and other tools. This is unacceptable! Proper German soldiers deserve only the best; these men should be given new guns at once!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Train the Guerillas"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Although there are a few partisans who have been fighting the Germans for over two decades, many of the fighters here are young, green, and haven't seen any fighting apart from taking pot-shots from the woods. They wouldn't stand up to a Russian mob, let alone trained soldiers from the Wehrmacht. These fighters need some serious training."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Ship in Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Our men on the field don't have the punch to really give the rebels they fight a good bashing. Our garrisons are assaulted again and again, but we don't have the firepower to make such assaults really punishing. That changes now; heavy artillery will change that dynamic in no time."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Smuggle in Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The Germans operate armored cars throughout the region as mobile patrol units. German garrisons are likewise hardened fortifications; assaulting these compounds and patrols is suicidal. Or rather, it is without any heavy ordnance. We certainly have plenty missile launchers laying around; why not send some of them where they can be put to good use?"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Send more Men!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Ever since we've started our occupation of Serbia, the garrison has always lacked the necessary manpower to properly garrison the small country. This has finally come to haunt us, and now we're dealing with multiple organized resistance groups. We must send more men if we are going to keep our hold on the country."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Provide Explosives to Urban Partisans"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Satchel charges are super destructive and can do a ton of damage in the right hands. These have limited impact in the country however, but in an urban setting, large explosions are perfect for sowing terror..."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_5:0 "Attach an Air Squadron"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "One of our key advantages we have over any partisan group that resists the Reich is total air superiority. Why Serbia hasn't been deemed important enough to warrant a small attachment is beyond us, but it's better late than never that we send some planes. These would be a huge help in fighting the rabbles in the forests."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_6:0 "Get Our Men Tanks"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_6_desc:0 "It is an expensive investment, but also a practicable one. There is no way untrained partisans can stand up to and fight a Panzer formation, much less disable one. A small panzer formation is just what our garrisons need to keep the rebels on their toes, and make them think twice before attacking us."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Spread Anti-Italian Propaganda"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The Italians are the true enemies of the Serbian peoples. It is the Italians, not us, who keep the Serb peoples from being united in one country. It is the Italians, not us, who caused the massive refugee crisis and forced tens of thousands to flee to the last free place the Serbians can call home. We sure won't let them forget it."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Spread Anti-German Propaganda"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "It is the Germans who have made Serbia the poverty stricken rump state it is today. They care not for anyone but themselves, and only occupy Serbia so they can drain it of all its life blood. They're rapists and killers, and everyone should know."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Give More Handouts to Refugees"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of the refugees are becoming restless. This isn't a huge concern, but it still makes our administration look bad. We could temporarily placate them by giving most upset refugees some extra supplies, and maybe even a few luxuries."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Spread Nationalist Rhetoric"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "The Serbs are a great people. Always steadfast in defense of their country, they aren't afraid to face off against the odds for their people and homes, and today is no different. All Serbians rise up! We will throw out the Germans!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Expose the Race War in Albania"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Hundreds of Serbs have been killed in Albania this last decade, and thousands more forced to flee for their lives while the Italians watched. For all our shortcomings, we haven't allowed state sanctioned genocide to occur here; lets let the people know that the Italians aren't heroes."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Rile Up the Refugees"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Poor, dirty, hungry, and trapped, the refugee camps are a literal ticking time bomb before they explode into rioting. The Germans are still keeping immigrants and refugees in the camps, often against their will. It wouldn't take much to rile up these angry people."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Improve Conditions in the Camps"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Many of our camps are still overfilled. Shortages of everything, from boots to medical supplies are in short supply. The Serbian refugees need a large amount of goods, and we can easily supply them if we so choose."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Sit Down With the Resistance"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "The many resistance groups of Serbia, while brave, do not work well together. It's a shame; a united front against the Germans would be a force to be reckoned with. We should gather the various groups into a room and help them iron out their differences. If we could get them to work together; the partisans as a whole would be much more dangerous and effective."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Praise German Generosity!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "\"The Serbians have flourished under our administration! German generosity has seen the state rise from a rabble run Communist wasteland to a glorious, independent state! They still have a ways to go, of course, but the Serbians have come far under German direction!\""
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Expose Horrid Work Camp Conditions"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "It's even worse than we thought. The Serbian \"work camps\" more resemble the disgusting concentration camps from World War II than a public works program to help get hard workers up on their feet. The rest of Serbia needs to see what the Germans are doing to their countrymen!"
