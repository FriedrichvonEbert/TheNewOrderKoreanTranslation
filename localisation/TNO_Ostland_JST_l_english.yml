 JST_The_Northern_Crusade:0 "The Northern Crusade"
 JST_The_Northern_Crusade_desc:0 "Whether the Baltics are infested with idolatrous pagans or subhuman scum, only the German is fit to purge the land of its filth. Just as the Knights of the Teutonic Order fought valiantly all those centuries ago, so must the SS rally to the noble cause of purification. By invoking the glorious past of the German Order, Jeckeln wishes to rally his brethren to embark upon a new Northern Crusade – one that will bear witness to the eradication of traitors and Untermenschen alike!"
 JST_Anti_Partisan_Tactics:0 "Anti Partisan Tactics"
 JST_Anti_Partisan_Tactics_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS has produced many a brave division, but have any matched the valiant devotion and fearsome tactics of the Totenkopf? Jeckeln's loyal service to this division, which fought bravely against soldiers and partisans alike in both France and the Soviet Union, has sparked inspiration on how to model his army and its tactics. Increasing attrition will be an inevitability for his men, but what they lose in resources they will make up for tenfold in strength, fury and brutality."
 JST_The_Speed_of_the_Totenkopf:0 "The Speed of the Totenkopf"
 JST_The_Speed_of_the_Totenkopf_desc:0 "Lumbering beasts may have the trength to crush their prey in an instant, but it is the swift predator that seizes their feast first. Jeckeln's time in the Totenkopf taught him much, but no lesson was as important as this: A division's most powerful weapon cannot be seen or held, but with enough skill can be mastered with ruthless efficiency. This weapon is speed. As such, Jeckeln's loyal forces will be trained to operate with the speed necessary to overwhelm the enemy and secure a rapid victory."
 JST_The_Wolves_Claws:0 "The Wolves' Claws Unsheathed"
 JST_The_Wolves_Claws_desc:0 "Only by burning away the rot of Ostland can we hope to achieve victory. The racial struggle must continue without mercy, and so Jecklen has decreed it necessary for his men to utilise chemical warfare to destroy his enemies with the utmost efficiency. There may be some dissent within the ranks at the use of such weapons, but these cries of protestation will fade with the wind when we stand tall over the corpses of the fallen and proclaim ourselves the true rulers of Ostland."

 JST.2.t:0 "Blood and Soil"
 JST.2.d:0 "In the light of the morning sun stood black columns of uniformed men. Friedrich Jeckeln surveyed his troops from the balcony, a Grand Master absorbing the glory of his brave knights. The philosophy of the Jewish rat Karl Marx was just as disgustingly asinine as his economics, but within the filth of his lies hid a nugget of truth: History did indeed repeat itself, although not as farce. There was nothing farcical about the war that had erupted throughout the Baltic lands. Two decades ago, the thick red blood of German martyrs had watered this fertile soil to ensure its conquest. The tides roll back and forth, the sun and moon rise and fall, and once more does this land crave the blood of the German. Jeckeln caressed the pistol in his holster with a smile. With knives and guns shall the new fertilization of Ostland commence.\n\nThe corrupt Stahlecker and the cowardly Drechsler. The scheming Vituska and the traitorous Meyer-Landrut. The filthy rat Kovner with his inhuman sycophants, burning Aryan men and defiling Aryan women. Ensconced within the great barrel drum of Ostland, craven kleptocrats and inhuman partisans alike crash together in violent discordance. As Jeckeln looked over the Schutzstaffel troops with a growing sense of pride, he knew that fate had tempered these men throughout the years to become the saviours of Ostland. He raised his hand in salute to heil Himmler, the last great standard-bearer of National Socialist thought, and felt a rush of ecstasy as the black masses saluted back in unison.\n\nJeckeln's speech began. The dark days of yore shall end, he proclaimed. Through great determination and might, Ostland shall become the model Aryan state under the watchful eye of the Burgundian System. There will be no tolerance for corruption, no mercy for partisans, no place for Untermenschen. Jecklen had lifted fate's gauntlet and heralded the inevitable purification of Ostland. No one would stand in their way."
 JST.2.a:0 "He is risen."
 
 JST.3.t:0 "Victory or Death"
 JST.3.d:0 "Every single day the Civil War raged on was another day of failure, and every single day this failure made itself known in the very air. Friedrich Jeckeln could taste it. He scribbled in furious silence, listening as his most trusted lieutenant delivered the latest battlefield reports. Walther Schröder stood over his superior with crossed arms, his furrowed brows and pouted lips frozen as he awaited a response. Finally, Jeckeln glanced upwards and thrusted a clump of papers in the man's arms.\n\n"Ensure these two orders are sent to my top generals at once," Jeckeln barked, grabbing more paper and scrawling intensely. He couldn't remember the last time he had slept. In times of struggle, rest was a reprieve fit only for the craven and the weak. "The one I gave you concerns the status of prisoners. We shall take no more. Anyone captured will be executed on the spot. They are a waste of time and resources and will only slow us down."\n\n"What is your other order?" Schröder queried after a few moments of silence.\n\n"Victory or death, Walther. Victory or death. No compromise, no concessions. None of my men shall be captured alive. Any soldier in such a position must shoot themselves or choke upon a cyanide pill. If this is not possible, then they must slit their own throats. If their knife is lost, they will find the nearest fucking rock and shove it through their eye if they have to. The lifeblood of our martyrs shall turn the soil as red as the Blutfahne we proudly display upon our arms. If our just cause is to die, then so shall we."\n\nThis was not a time for half-measures. If they faltered now, all would be lost. If instead they stood firm and true, willing to do what must be done... then the civil war's great tide of blood and ash would sweep Jeckeln high to the leadership of Ostland, and perhaps beyond."
 JST.3.a:0 "Greatness awaits us all."

 JST_A_Dark_Sun_Over_Ostland:0 "A Dark Sun Over Ostland"
 JST_A_Dark_Sun_Over_Ostland_desc:0 "Ostland is diseased. This beautiful land, once destined to become the model state of Germanization, has atrophied into chaos and degeneracy. Politicians, officers, subhuman partisans – all fester within its body, spreading their corruption and filth. The great saviour Friedrich Jeckeln must use everything at his disposal to claw his way to victory, resurrect the true ideals of National Socialism, and secure this nation for generations of Aryans to come. The Dark Sun is risen, and in its shadow shall the great purge begin."
 JST_Our_Friends_in_Polesien:0 "Our Friends in Polesien"
 JST_Our_Friends_in_Polesien_desc:0 "Before his troops, Jeckeln makes grand speeches to inspire those loyal to his cause; behind closed doors, he negotiates and conspires to strengthen his position. Jeckeln's connections to the slave industry in Polesien will ensure his forces acquire the weapons they need to slay the enemy without mercy. It is only fitting that our treacherous enemies be executed with weapons forged by the subhuman hands they relied on so much."
 JST_Redemptive_Labor:0 "Redemptive Labor"
 JST_Redemptive_Labor_desc:0 "The slaves in our possession must be worked to the extreme if we are to succeed in this war. The threat of a bullet in the head is a powerful motivation for many slaves, but there are those propelled into higher effort by the power of hope. The term "slave labor" demoralises these creatures, and so to help them achieve maximum efficiency, Jeckeln has decreed it be renamed to "redemptive labor". For the workers, there will be fatigue and pain and death – but after all, through redemption all things are possible..."
 JST_Smuggling_From_the_West:0 "Smuggling From the West"
 JST_Smuggling_From_the_West_desc:0 "No number of weapons are enough to satiate the hunger of this Civil War. Connections are a powerful tool in such times as these, and none are as loyal as the SS in Germany. With assistance in the west, Jeckeln shall smuggle more arms into his territory and deliver this gift to those forces who need it the most. Anti-Jeckeln propaganda will spew what it may, but our movement is not so isolated after all..."
 JST_The_Northern_Crusade:0 "The Northern Crusade"
 JST_The_Northern_Crusade_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the brave Knights of the Teutonic Order embarked upon the noble campaign to purge paganism from the Baltics. History once more repeats itself as the collapse of Ostland heralds the emergence of a new generation of brave knights, versed in the grand tenets of the Schutzstaffel. Under the tutelage of Jeckeln, the SS shall march onwards to expunge the disease that festers within the borders of this fractured land. Subhumans, schemers and traitors alike shall suffer the might of our advance. Jeckeln is risen!"
 JST_A_Call_to_Arms:0 "A Call to Arms"
 JST_A_Call_to_Arms_desc:0 "Like the Aryan child, the Schutzstaffel was at first a curious, headstrong and courageous creature. Like the Aryan teenager, war and conquest strengthened it into a hardened, stoic and indomitable beast. Like the Aryan man, its lust for victory and land is matched only by the desire to protect its seed. To purify Ostland, Jeckeln must unite all available SS men to his righteous cause. The time has come to rally the black banners."
 JST_Against_the_Untermensch:0 "Against the Untermensch"
 JST_Against_the_Untermensch_desc:0 "The Eternal Jew has returned. The Untermensch is risen. The dark forces of these kikes and Slavs sweep across Ostland like a cancer, ravaging everything they touch. Our noble efforts to cleanse Europe of such filth were too weak. As long as Jeckeln's strength flows strongly through every SS warrior, the warlords Kovner and Vituska will never reclaim their peoples' perverse mantle of power over Europe. These rats will be driven out or burned out, begging for mercy all the way. We will show them none."
 JST_Against_the_Traitors:0 "Against the Traitors"
 JST_Against_the_Traitors_desc:0 "Cunning and avarice is within the Jew's nature, and uncultured idiocy infects the Slav... but those of German blood who defile the tenets of National Socialism are the greatest evil. Race traitors were once thrown into camps; now they get fat in their ivory towers while Slavs steal German work and partisans run rampant. Stahlecker and Drechsler are two sides of the same corrupt coin, and every second they proudly display the Swastika is a further second of agony we shall inflict on them for despoiling this land."
 JST_Obedience_Unto_Death:0 "Obedience Unto Death"
 JST_Obedience_Unto_Death_desc:0 "The days grow darker and the evils we face seem insurmountable, but nothing will stop Jeckeln and his men from saving the Aryan race. Only two options face us now: Victory or Death. From this day forth the warriors of the SS must take a noble vow, like that of the Teutonic Knights of yore, pledging their utmost allegiance to Friedrich Jeckeln and promising to follow him and his cause unto their heroic deaths. Those who refuse shall have everything taken from them."
 JST_Anti_Partisan_Experience:0 "Anti Partisan Experience"
 JST_Anti_Partisan_Experience_desc:0 "The subhuman partisans fawning in Kovner's shadow had caused chaos for Lohse's administration for over two decades. They may call themselves soldiers now, but Kovner's men continue to wage the guerrilla warfare they've trained in for so long. Now fuelled with the hopeless ambition of total dominance, their threat has increased exponentially. Fortunately for Jeckeln's black ranks, his time in the Waffen-SS Totenkopf division taught him the harshest of anti-partisan tactics, which will be imperative in crushing enemies both within and without."
 JST_Totenkopf_Speed:0 "Totenkopf Speed"
 JST_Totenkopf_Speed_desc:0 "Victory must be secured rapidly and brutally, before Ostland's final flame of hope is snuffed out forevermore. Training will commence to transform Jeckeln's men into warriors of speed, just as the Totenkopf had been in the days of the Second Weltkrieg. The SS divisions must be swift as the coursing river to spread their might across this land, and only one word should scream in their heads as they march onwards: Faster!"
 JST_From_the_Wolves_Lair:0 "From the Wolves' Lair"
 JST_From_the_Wolves_Lair_desc:0 "A single rodent can be hammered, stabbed, even shot – but in order to wipe out an entire mischief of rats, one must turn to the reliability of poison. Chemical warfare is not just necessary but justified in sucking the life from our enemies with speed and effectiveness. There will be inevitable strife within the ranks at such drastic measures, but their cowardice will not infringe on our desire for victory. The enemies of Jeckeln are little more than vermin, and so shall they be treated as little more than vermin."
 JST_By_Order_of_Jeckeln:0 "By Order of Jeckeln"
 JST_By_Order_of_Jeckeln_desc:0 "Hours of intense discussion and debate has broken out between Jeckeln and his most trusted officers. The cause must be strengthened by any means necessary, lest victory is to be snatched from our grasp. The solution is drastic but simple. Two orders will be sent out to all fighting men, and with these orders shall come victory everlasting."
 JST_No_Mercy:0 "No Mercy"
 JST_No_Mercy_desc:0 "We are men of action. We are men of terror. We are not, and will never be, men of mercy. As the war rages on, every soldier must remember their duty to kill every foe in sight. We shall end their miserable lives and continue the march to glory. We shall take no prisoners. We shall feel no remorse. Our heads must be hard and our hearts must be cold. Only then shall we overcome."
 JST_No_Surrender:0 "No Surrender"
 JST_No_Surrender_desc:0 "Until this conflict is ended, not a single man shall lay his weapon down upon the soil. To bow one's head in shame, and raise one's arms in capitulation, is to betray the Aryan race itself. No man shall surrender, no man shall yield. If defeat and capture is inevitable, so is the duty of every man in such a position to take their own life. Victory or death awaits us all - nothing in between."
 JST_A_Pure_Ostland:0 "A Pure Ostland"
 JST_A_Pure_Ostland_desc:0 "At last Jeckeln arises to the din of glorious concert. United through Blood and Soil, the noble knights of the SS have secured victory and brought peace to this fractured land. With the iron grip of the Burgundian System in place, Jeckeln and his most loyal men shall now begin the grand purification of Ostland. Behold, in the east – the perfect Aryan State!"
