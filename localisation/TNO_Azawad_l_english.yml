 POLITICS_INTALLA_AG_ATTAHER_DESC:0 "Intalla ag Attahar has had a rough life, and there is no arguing the point. Born in French West Africa in 1927 as the son of Attahar Ag III, he witnessed first hand as the French colonial order that had confined and oppressed him and his people collapsed into dust. It was almost as if Allah himself had struck them down- one day they were there, and in the next they were gone. In this vacuum, Intalla and his father prepared the Ifhogas- the tribes they nominally ruled over- to continue their existence as an independent Touareg Confederation.\n\nThis was not to be.\n\nGerman bombers soon began to obliterate the dunes and jungles of West Africa, destroying the cities and towns the Ifhogas ran and forcing them to flee into the sands of the Sahara. While this was a terrible setback for the father and son's plans for an independent Touareg Confederation, it would, ironically, serve to help them in the long run. The other contenders for the region, being less used to the nomadic life, were slowly ground to dust while the Ifhogas continued to survive, if not thrive. As the years went on and the bombings continued endlessly, the morale of the tribes began to flag, and almost collapsed with the death of Attahar. However, Intalla stepped up into his father's seat, and was granted a blessing shortly after- the daily roaring of planes suddenly stopped. In near disbelief, the Toauregs spread out and conquered the lands of Azawad under Intalla's banner.\n\nNow, Intalla rules what he and his father always dreamed of- an independent Taureg kingdom. All across the Sahel, wayward tribes flock to the nation-state, drawn by the seemingly inconceivable promises that Intalla has not only made, but upheld- stability, freedom, and total independence from those who wish to own the Toaureg people again.\n\nThe tribes have their freedom. If anyone, African or European, dares try to subjugate the area again, they will meet the fury of the natives, and Intalla will be the one to lead them."
