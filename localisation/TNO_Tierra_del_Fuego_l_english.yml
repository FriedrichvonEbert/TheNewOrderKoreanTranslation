  POLITICS_JOSE_MARIA_GUZMAN_DESC: "The lack of scruples and agitated nature of Argentine politics sometimes open the gates of power to men who in no normal situation would ever find themselves in a position to accede to them. Such is the case of Rear-Admiral José María Guzmán, a naval hydrographer who occupied a bureaucratic post at the recently provincialized Patagonia Province in 1956.\n\nWhen news that Peron had been toppled in Buenos Aires reached Tierra del Fuego, the then-Captain Guzmán rushed to secure the local power vacuum by performing a coup of his own, and declaring himself governor of the restored Maritime Territory. Somewhat ignored by Buenos Aires in the convoluted months that followed, Guzmán was confirmed at his post by Admiral Hartung, and survived the change in government after 1958 when  Hartung vetoed Frondizi's plan to abolish the naval territory.\n\nWith oversight over the delicate southern frontier, and nominal jurisdiction over the disputed islands under Canadian administration and Argentine Antarctica,  Guzmán, who rules with the sum of public power, has spent most of his time desperately attempting to bring in settlers to the barren island, and preparing for the eventuality of conflict with either Chile or Canada. His surprisingly stable rule over the territory, shared only with the minister of government appointed by the President, has remained relatively popular, albeit dampened by the continued, active persecution of Peronists, in trials often presided over by Guzmán himself."

  TDF_navy_fiefdom: "Fiefdom at the End of the World"
  TDF_navy_fiefdom_desc: "The military Revolution of June 1943 was inspired to some degree by paranoia over Argentina's weak grip over its southern possessions. Unsurprisingly, the military determined itself to be the optimal institution to strengthen the presence of the state in Patagonia, and to that effect took direct control over Comodoro Rivadavia and Tierra del Fuego. The former - an army administration - was eventually returned to civilians as the province of Chubut. The latter, in spite of being a Peronist creation, remains firmly in existence and under the control of the Argentine Navy, the Hartung government having vetoed its proposed abolition by Frondizi .\n\nLaw-Decree 5626, which established naval control over the territory, gave the sum of public powers to the governor of the territory, and officially reserved the position for senior navy officers, nominally appointed by the President. Its dictatorial nature aside, the territory has proven an improvement, and has significantly strengthened the presence of the Argentine state in the barren south, successfully encouraging colonization."
  TDF_conflict_zone: "분쟁 지대"
  TDF_conflict_zone_desc: "Argentina is a traditionally peaceful country, with few external enemies. Its territorial disputes, however, remain plentiful, and are almost exclusively localized within the area over which the Maritinate Governorship, which spans the entire south atlantic, has nominal control.\n\nGiven the navy's traditionally hawkish position on these issues, their control of the Governorship could prove unhelpful towards the peaceful resolution of these differences.
