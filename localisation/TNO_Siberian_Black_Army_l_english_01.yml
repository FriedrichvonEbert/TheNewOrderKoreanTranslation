 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_SIBERIAN_SOVIET_DESC: "연방의 붕괴로 앙가라 강 유역의 시민들은 러시아 정부의 권위로부터 자유로워졌습니다. 진정한 사회주의적 방식으로 그들이 한 첫번째 일은 위원회를 구성하는 것이었습니다. 많은 지역 공동체들이 정부의 감독 없이 잘 작동되고 있었고, 배급제도를 축소시키면 연방 안의 다른곳에서 수입한 많은 물품들은 현지 대체품으로 대체될 수 있었습니다. 서러시아의 소련 정부 잔당들과의 접촉은 끊겼으며, 그들은 자신들의 피로 자유를 위해 투쟁하는 민병대를 형성하면서 중앙 시베리아 공화국의 '민주적'인 임시정부와 겐리흐 야고다의 압제적인 정권을 인정하기를 주저했습니다. 그래서 그들은 한때 소련의 가장 먼 곳에서부터 아나키즘 사상가들의 유입에 영향을 받아, 그들은 모든 도시와 산업 조합의 대표자가 동등한 자치 통치 기구인 시베리아 아나키즘 평의회로서의 독립을 선언했습니다.\n\n외세의 위협으로부터의 입지가 안정됨에 따라, 이야 강의 자유 공산주의 군벌인 시베리아 흑군은 평의회의 영향력이 강한 단체가 되어 군사적 아나키즘을 주요 강령으로 선언했습니다. 민병대는 자유 지대의 모든 남녀의 필수적인것이 되었으며 자유 공동체의 무장조직은 자유 공동체를 위한 자기 방어 수단일 뿐만 아니라 자유로운 이념을 해외에도 전파하는 목적으로 모였습니다.\n\n아나키즘의 이상과 모순인 것처럼 보이는 군사적 아나키즘 사회는 군대와 평의회 사이의 많은 분쟁을 없앴습니다, 그렇지만 많은 평민들은 시베리아 공동체의 독립 수호자들인 흑군의 야망이 결국 평민들의 자유의 후퇴가 될까봐 두려워합니다."
 
 POLITICS_KHAKASSIA_SECURITY_COUNCIL_DESC: "어머니 아나키의 시작과 지속에 의한 충격만큼이나 방위 위원회가 시베리아 정치의 결정적인 힘으로 부상한 것은 많으면서도 적은 이들에게 충격으로 다가왔습니다. 국제 관측통들은 소외된 총회의 의미를 곰곰이 생각하고 있는 반면, 권력을 가진 흑군의 지휘 아래 있는 사람들은 그들 앞에 더 어려운 난제를 겪고 있는데, 바로 그들이 여전히 자유롭다고 부를 수 있는가에 대한 문제입니다.\n\n중앙 시베리아에서 제공하는 가장 영향력 있고 재능 있는 장교들로 구성된 자유 지구는 당초 목표에서 벗어나 항로를 변경했습니다. 한때는 평생 폭정의 군홧발 밑에서 살아온 고통을 본 사람들이 모여 영겁의 시간동안 인류를 괴롭혔던 억압적인 체제에 대항하는 단결된 투쟁이었던 것이 이반 스테파노프 장군의 계략에 의해 변화되고 기형적으로 변질된 것입니다.\n\n스테파노프의 명성은 중앙 시베리아 공화국이 붕괴하는 동안 나타났습니다. 야고다 국가의 심장부로 진격해 들어가는 임무를 맡은 사단장이었던 장군은 의회에서 정치꾼들이 내리는 명령에 의해 더 많은 러시아인들이 더 많은 러시아인들을 죽이기 위해 행진하는 무의미함을 보았습니다. 힘 있는 웅변가이자 노조 지도자 표트르 시우다와의 즉흥적인 협상에서 스테파노프는 폭정과 권위에 대항하여 그의 사단을 규합했고 시우다는 그 운동의 대중적 지지를 확보했습니다.\n\n이반 스테파노프의 정상에 오르기위한 여정은 오랜 시간이 걸렸지만, 총회가 무력화되면서, 이제 장군이 해야할 일은 명확해졌습니다. 그가 항상 해왔던 일을 하는 것, 좋은 공연을 해내는 것입니다."
 
 POLITICS_MONGUSH_BUYAN_BADYRGY_DESC: "The former Chairman of the Council of Ministers and presumed successor to Donduk Kuular in the old Tuvan People's Republic, Mongush Buyan-Badyrgy leads a people that have long been neglected and forgotten. Enduring through the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva emerged as an independent state, sending what little aid they could to the Mongolian People's Republic to hold off the imperialist Japanese forces. Yet in spite of the efforts of the Tuvan and Mongolian people, Ulaanbaatar fell to the invaders, and many in Kuular's government feared Kyzyl would be next.\n\nSo, when Red Army forces arrived in Tuva, this was received as nothing short of a blessing. The request that the Tuvan People's Republic would become subordinate to the Red Army command was an insignificant price to pay in return for a chance to stave off Japan.\n\nAfter Kuular's death, Buyan-Badyrgy became the new head of the Tuvan government under the People's Revolutionary Council. And when Red Army forces capitulated to the Black Army invading from the north, he was allowed to walk free due to his popularity with the Tuvan people. For a time Buyan-Badyrgy remained content with this; little had changed other than the banner of the army protecting them. Yet once again chaos erupted in the war-torn region as various communes in the north of the Free Territory declared their secession, and had led to the arrival of Ivan Stepanov's forces.\n\nNow a new army had arrived in Tuva, for much the same reasons as the last. This army, however, they had no desire for cooperation with the Tuvan people; they organized conscription, diverted production and set up defences, dragging Tuva into more needless conflict. Buyan-Badyrgy could not stand idly by through this, and so, rallying former members of the Tuvan army and government, alongside Altaic partisans, he led a revolt against the Black Army's rule. Once more Tuva must fight against overwhelming forces, yet having overcome such odds before, Buyan-Badyrgy knows Tuva will prevail again."
 POLITICS_REGIONAL_COUNCILS_DESC: "Anarchy - the ideal that had liberated Central Siberia from the shackles of authoritarianism, warlordism and elitism, has fallen. When the communes of Krasnoyarsk declared their independence and returned to the darkness that had consumed the region months prior, the communes of northern Siberia found themselves cut off from the General Assembly's guidance. Panic rose as the loss of an agreed-upon inter-communal body left them divided and undirected.\n\nYet days passed, which became weeks and then months, and the communes of north Siberia remained. The fear of invasion from the new warlords to the south did not come to fruition, the prospect of a famine arising from a lack of coordination between communes, too, never came to pass. Although undoubtedly facing hardships, the decentralised communes of the North Siberian Soviets have survived, now separate from all authority.\n\nWhile this extreme decentralisation makes the fielding of an army, coordination in development and any form of decisive action near impossible, the communes of Norilsk, Kolpashevo and their many rural comrades persist. The General Assembly, previously seen as vital to the coordination of the Free Territory, is now seen as an obsolete organization, one which impeded the people of Siberia from realising true anarchism.\n\nThough in the harsh lands of Russia, with warlords to the south and centralized states forming to the east and west, can such a system truly survive?"
 POLITICS_IVAN_STEPANOV_DESC: "If there were to be one upside to the collapse of the Soviet Union, it would undoubtedly be the wide assortment of characters, heroes and villains alike, with wildly different motivations, dreams, and goals able to reforge the nation in their own vision. What warlord could claim to be as visionary as the Free Territory? The struggle for anarchism didn't always have to be a dream. There exists a world where Siuda and his faction are triumphant, a world where anarchism is finally allowed a chance to prove itself, a world where all people may one day be free, a world without Ivan Georgievich Stepanov.\n\nWhat sets Stepanov apart from Leninist mutineers and Rurikids monarchs is not that he is without vision or purpose, in that regard he isn't much different from Siuda himself. One could easily claim that Stepanov's vision is grander than Siuda's or any other warlord scattered across shattered Russia. Slowly building a hidden hierarchy in the Free Territory that revolves entirely around him, Stepanov pioneered the Security Council, a body able to override the General Assembly in the name of territorial integrity. At the time, the Security Council was an absolute necessity, forcing even the most passionate ideologues to begrudgingly accept the body's role in the Free Territory. However, as the Free Territory subsumed more and more, people began to question why the council was still necessary.\n\nWell? Why was it? To the safety of the Free Territory, it was no longer necessary. To finalize Stepanov's goals, the Security Council was everything, the only way for him to exercise control. And, for Ivan Stepanov, that's what it's always been about; control. For the longest time, Stepanov has been willing to bide his time, to wait until he was the focal point in which the Free Territory revolves around. But he's waited for more than two decades now, putting up with the nonsensical whims of people whose ideology he doesn't understand and doesn't care to. Many opportunities have presented themselves to Stepanov and he's let them slip right through his fingers. Now, in the chaos of anarchy, Stepanov will grab that opportunity tight, strangle it, and never let go."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_ASTAFYEV: "Krasnoyarsk was a state founded on promises. Promises of freedom, promises of greatness, promises of prosperity for decades to come. Where are all those promises now?\n\nComrade Siuda made many promises upon the Black Army's entry into Krasnoyarsk as well. Promises of liberation, promises of emancipation, and promises of equality for all. For a time, in the days and weeks following the collapse of Andreev's fiefdom, these promises were made good upon. The Black Army expelled the city's oppressors while representatives of the General Assembly established a local assembly in conjunction with the Social Democratic Party. It was in the overcrowded, unkept, and musty cafeteria of the Siberian Technical Institute of Forest that Viktor Petrovich Astafyev first got a taste for anarchism. Those sent to aid in the reorganization of structure in the city did well at adjusting a moderate democrat such as Astafyev to the new lifestyle awaiting him and the other inhabitants of the city. Emerging as a communal leader, Astafyev met with Siuda and Taratuta on multiple occasions. Viktor's close association with Siuda and high-ranking members of the General Assembly made his betrayal all the worse.\n\nAstafyev pondered if this was truly anarchism as his city became home to the headquarters of the Black Army. Astafyev's requests for increased civilian governance fell on deaf ears as quotas were delivered from Kilchichakov, Mishurenko established a permanent residence in the city alongside his large following of soldiers, and Stepanov cast down veto after veto on local motions.\n\nSiuda truly is no different than Andreev, and Astafyev and the people of Russia are far past empty promises. Though Siuda and the General Assembly have made multiple requests for Krasynoarsk to return to the fold, Siuda is not free of sin. In the mind of Viktor Nekrasov, associating with tyrants makes one no better, and tyrants have no place in a free Russia."
 POLITICS_YURIY_KRYLOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Yuriy Nikolayevich Krylov is a man trapped in a storybook. At least, it's been easier for him to view his life as a story being told rather than a life being lived. The author of the tragedy has seen fit that Yuriy be a protagonist, a prince presiding over a troubled land.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a young boy. He was a noble, but lived as one amongst the citizens of the flourishing kingdom. One day, while the young boy read by the river, an evil wizard came to his kingdom, hexing all those around him to be slaves, unrelenting in service to their master. The wizard's tricks did not affect the royal family. The king and his guard fought gallantly to repel the wizard, but the wizard and his knight overwhelmed the kingdom, taking the king prisoner and leaving the hero's sister slain in battle.\n\nSpared by the forces of the wizard under the protection of his subjects, Yuriy assumed a new identity, renouncing his titles. Still, the hero worked tirelessly to enhance the lives of his people, subverting the wizard's puppet administration. For a time, it seemed as though the wizard's empire was invincible, until a rift opened up between the wizard and the knight. The knight began to assert himself as the hegemon of the region, using whatever means necessary to secure a kingdom of his own. The brutal methods of the knight and the waning influence of the wizard provided an opportunity to strike, as the prophecy had foretold.\n\nThe hero, having assumed the name and title of King Rurik III, rallied his most loyal supporters to break free of the wizard's brainwashing and to live in freedom once more. While the hero of prophecy recuperates his forces, the mad general of the south continues his raids. The story of King Rurik III is far from over. The battle of prophecy will soon commence and the people can finally live...\n\n§G...Happily ever after.§!"
 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "What place does a conservative businessman have in Russia? In the days of the empire, he would find his virgining enterprise quashed by the backwardness of the Tsar. In the days of the Union, he would find his owings confiscated at best and his life too at worst. Now, in the days of the Russian anarchy, more than ever, what place is there for a conservative businessman?\n\nDespite his grievances with Pokryshkin and the unapologetic kleptocrats of the federation, the fall of Novosibirsk and, more importantly to him, Barnaul, left Shukshin in a severe state of depression. The chaos and confusion of the days and weeks following the capitulation of the federation scattered many of Russia's best and brightest into the wind. Pokryshkin; missing and presumed dead. The chief officers of the mega corporations; executed or imprisoned. Vasily Makarovich Shukshin was all that remained of the capitalist establishment. Forced into a life of reclusion after his popularity with the citizenry spared him from punishment, Shukshin spent his days drinking in the solitude of his home. Truly, people reach their lowest points when excluded from the majority and under the tyranny of the General Assembly, the majority was never so powerful and Shukshin was never so weak..That was, until one day, Shukshin received a letter.\n\nA former high ranking member of the Barnaul city council expressed the raising discontent in the city. The letter was clear in goal, even if the language hid the fact, the cracks in the anarchist foundation had begun to show and the people yearned for the promise of the federation. Shukshin became a man rejuvenated, his optimism and sense of purpose restored. The schism in the anarchist movement proves only one thing, anarchism doesn't work. Unlike the splintered anarchist movement, Shukshin has a job to do, and he'll be damned if the anarchists get the better of him twice."
 POLITICS_VITALY_KOSTIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Can one person change the world? Sure. A Romanov, a businessman, a scholar, people of class, all can bend the world to their whims. But can a slave? Can a simple worker take the reins of oppression and break them without a Lenin? Vitaly Semyonovich Kostin doesn't really know, and, in all honesty, he hoped he would never have to find out.\n\nNothing more than a construction engineer in Novosibirsk, Kostin quickly became one of the most ardent supporters of the Free Territory and their liberationist message. Present at the liberation of the city, Kostin proved an effective organizer and orator, with his simple populist message resonating with his fellow workers. The strike fostered by Kostin proved instrumental in the Free Territory's campaign against the Siberian Falcon. Following the establishment of an assembly in Novosibirsk, Kostin, a man of humble origins, sought to return to his modest life of work, content to leave the fate of Russia to the capable hands of Comrade Siuda. But it was not Siuda who laid claim to the city first.\n\nIn the weeks following the campaign, one name became more common than that of Pokryshkin; Ivan Stepanov. They began as whispers, rumors of a powerful lackey to Siuda who formed the muscle of their duo. Word spread quickly, but it was the seemingly unendingly increasing number of Black Army soldiers present at factories and demonstrations that made it clear something was amiss. Strict quotas, political repression, and rampant corruption left many residents of the city scratching their heads, wondering what changed. The blatant repression of the working people became so severe it forced one man out of retirement.\n\nBetrayed by the capitalists of Novosibirsk and once more by the anarchists of Kansk, Kostin embodies the heart and soul of the Russian people; tired. How many revolts must occur? How many times must the people be lied to? Kostin doesn't know all the answers, he doesn't know much at all, but he does know that oppression in any form must be stamped out, no matter if it hides behind the skull and crossbones or not."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_NEKRASOV_DESC: "Disillusioned with the tyranny of Chairman Yagoda and at odds with the corporate capitalists of Novosibirsk, Viktor Platonovich Nekrasov found himself most closely aligned with Shostakovich and the Humanist salon in Tomsk. Despite this, Nekrasov could never find his footing with the more radical social democrats and moderate socialists. Nekrasov felt lost. His ideology was much to the left of prominent humanists yet still to the right of the anarchist movement cultivating to the south. Without a movement to call home, Nekrasov resigned himself to a life of writing, a passion he had picked up after settling in the intellectual heart of Russia. Nekrasov took an interest in journalism. His lack of ideological alignment may have left him isolated but granted him an exceptional career as a war correspondent, covering the movements of warlords across Central Siberia and to the east. It was the Black Army that garnered the most attention from him.\n\nIf his attention was not captured by the expansion of the Free Territory, its leaders marching down the streets of Tomsk most certainly did. While his views didn't line up with Siudaist thought one to one, he had little complaints in the following the liberation of the city. The abolishment of the salon system offered him more say than previously, and the Territory's aversion to authoritarianism was certainly appreciated. As days and weeks went by, however, it seemed as though the conflict in Tomsk never ceased. Anarchist splinter groups loyal to different factions and philosophies battled openly in the streets prompting larger quantities of Black Army detachments to police the city.\n\nAs the conflict swelled, Nekrasov felt a divide grow in him as well. If history were to continue, if scholars and scribes could still find work in a cutthroat era of utilitarianism, the march on Tomsk would go down as the most significant workers strike of a generation and Viktor Nekrasov wouldn't be where he was. However, fate is often unkind, and those with the best intentions often find themselves on the wrong side of history."

 SBA_intro_assemble_the_communal_representatives_desc: "시베리아 흑군 총회는 우리가 해방시킨 아나키즘 공동체와 모든 공동체의 정책 조율을 목표로, 우리의 탄생 첫해에 만들어진 기관 중 하나였습니다. 정기적으로 소집되어 일상적인 문제를 다루는 경우가 많지만, 자유구역의 완벽한 작동엔 여전히 중요합니다.\n\n시간이 흐를수록, 우리는 이 혼란스럽고 불안정한 환경에서 계속 생존하고 있으며, 우리가 방심하지 않고 아나키의 이상을 유지한다는 사실과 많은 관련이 있습니다. 이를 위해 우리는 또한 내부에서의 협력을 추구해야하며, 총회는 우리 영토의 문제를 공개적이고 투명하게 논의함으로써 우리에게 그 일을 할 수 있는 탁월한 방법을 제공합니다."
 SBA_intro_assemble_the_security_council_desc: "시베리아 흑군은 러시아 인민의 진정한 자유를 옹호하지만, 현재 우리가 처해있는 상황에서 군대의 조직적 보호가 필요없다고 주장하는 것은 터무니 없는 거짓말일 것입니다. 그래서 우리는 인민들이 지지하는 군사적 아나키즘 체제를 채택했습니다. 이 체제에 중요한 것은 흑군에 충성하는 모든 민병대의 지휘관들로 구성된 안전 보장 위원회입니다. 물론, 이 지휘관들은 모두 군인들이 스스로 뽑은 것이고, 이렇게 함으로써 우리는 그들이 우리의 목소리와 이익을 대변한다고 확신할 수 있습니다. 안전 보장 위원회의 또 다른 회의는 우리가 최근의 모든 안보문제를 언급하고 해결하는데 도움을 줄 것입니다."

 SBA_intro_present_revolutionary_security_reports_desc: "자유구역의 군대는 해방된 우리 땅을 지키는 중추적인 역할을 하고 있는데, 그들이 아니였다면 우리는 결코 사슬을 끊어내지 못했을 것이고, 우리는 여전히 야고다의 압제적인 제국 또는 중앙 시베리아 '민주' 국가의 통치하에 있을 것입니다. 그러나 모든 부대의 기능과 동작들의 보증하는 것을 동기화되고 조화를 이루도록 하는 것은 엄청나게 어려운 작업입니다. 그러한 이유로, 우리 영토 전역의 상황들을 개략적으로 설명하고, 공동체를 위험으로부터 구제하고 방어하기 위한 노력을 조정하는데 도움을 주는 "보안 보고서"가 필요했습니다. 제 3차 칸스크 총회가 열리는 상황에서 보안 보고서는 중앙 시베리아의 큰 그림과 그것이 아나키스트 공동체에 미치는 영향을 보여주기 때문에 중요합니다. 러시아 군벌주의의 혼란 속에서 우리가 직면한 위협에 대처하는 단결력은 매우 중요합니다."
 SBA_intro_present_local_developmental_reports_desc: "칸스크 총회에서 수많은 공동대표들에게 우리 실험의 성공을 보여주려면, 프로젝트의 성과와 모든 정착지의 자치권들을 보여줘야 합니다. 모든 마을이 국가 당국으로부터가 아나라 단지 아나키 상태의 원리를 통해 도움을 받아 지역 주민들이 자유롭게 그들의 터전을 개발할 수 있도록 했다는 것은 분명합니다. 우리는 전문가들로 하여금 총회의 개발 도상 지역사회에 대한 그들의 연구 결과와 보고서를 발표하게 함으로써 이것을 강조할 필요가 있습니다. 이런 식으로, 우리는 또한 고집스러운 대표들에게 우리 체제의 효과에 대해 설득시킬 것입니다."

 SBA_second_the_red_mantle_desc: "시베리아 계획은 독소전에 산업적으로 대비하기 위해 전선에서 떨어진 곳에서 시작한 대규모 산업 계획이었습니다. 결국 전쟁에서는 패했지만, 그 기간 동안 건설한 산업은 그 어느 누구도 예상했던거보다 훨씬 능가하도록 소련을 밀었습니다. 아이러니하게도, 시베리아 소비에트의 영토는 이 계획의 핵심 지역이 아니었고, 따라서 우리의 산업 능력은 이웃 나라들에 비해 낮습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 우리가 지금 이용할 수 있는 산업은 우리가 확장할 수 있는 견고한 기반을 제공할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_peoples_survey_desc: "코뮌 경제에서 자원을 적절하게 할당하기 위해서는, 어떤 지역이 산업 개발에 적합한지 혹은 자원 추출에 적합한지 그것도 아니면 농업 개발에 적합한지 아는 것이 중요합니다. 게다가 군벌들 사이의 경계는 종종 불확실하고 바뀌기 마련입니다. 토지 조사를 통해 우리는 정확히 어떤 영토가 우리 땅인지, 그리고 전쟁이 발발했을 때 어떤 영토를 방어하는 것이 가치 있거나 전략적인지를 알 수 있을 것이다. 이를 위해 코뮌들은 이웃 코뮌들과 협력하여 자발적으로 토지를 측량하는 '인민 설문 조사'에 참여하도록 요청받을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_industrial_data_consolidation_desc: "우리의 독특한 분산형 정부 형태로 인해, 각 코뮌이 이용 할 수 있는 산업적 기계의 품질과 양은 종종 코뮌 스스로가 무엇을 생산할 수 있는지에 따라 결정됩니다. 이로 인해 지역사회 간 산업력 격차가 크게 벌어졌고, 일부 지역사회는 그들의 필요에 맞춰서 생산을 할 수 없게 되었습니다. 여러 공동체에서 제공하는 산업 정보를 조합한 결과, 생산 능력에 대한 투자를 통해 자신의 효용을 얻을 수 있는 여러 공동체들을 확인하게 되었습니다."
 SBA_second_begin_the_redistribution_desc: "우리가 시베리아 소비에트 연방을 처음 설립했을 때 시작한 토지 개혁은 아직도 끝나지 않았습니다. 단순히 시베리아 전쟁에서 살아남는 것에 초점을 맞춰서 우리의 시간과 노력의 대부분을 소비했기 때문이죠. 이러한 문제들이 해결되었기 때문에, 우리는 각 공동체의 요구에 따라 토지를 재분배하는 것을 재개 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 우리가 이 문제를 해결 하는데 실패한 것 주된 이유는, 일부 코뮌이 그들의 규모와 인력을 남용하여 다른 코뮌들의 필요로 하는 땅에서 몰아내도록 만들었기 때문입니다. 이 토지 개혁 계획은 보다 공정하고 공평한 방법으로 코뮌간 경계을 재정비하는 방안을 모색할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_repair_the_transsib_desc: "구 차르정의 몇 안 되는 성공 가운데는 시베리아 횡단 철도 건설이 있었습니다. 그 철도는 러시아에 큰 영향을 끼쳐, 그 나라를 이전에는 보지 못했던 방식으로 묶었죠. 부하린 정권 동안 광범위하게 사용되었고, 2차 세계대전 이후 1950년대 소련-독일 전쟁에서 소련의 중요한 동맥이 되었다. 우리가 전쟁에서 패한 후, 독일 폭격기들은 철도를 거의 완전히 파괴했습니다. 하지만, 독일 폭격기들은 러시아 상공에서 멀리 떨어져 있기 때문에, 우리는 국경 내에서 운행되는 철도의 일부를 수리할 수 있고, 이전의 영광 중 일부를 다시 되돌릴 수도 있을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_continue_regional_interconnection_desc: "기반 시설의 개발은 항상 우리가 해야할 중요한 일 중 하나입니다. 그것은 나라 전체의 자원 흐름을 개선할 뿐만 아니라, 경제적으로나 정치적으로 코뮌들을 더욱 가깝게 합니다. 코뮌 간 유대는 시베리아 소비에트 연방의 범위를 넓힐 때 시험 받을 수 있고, 그렇기 때문에 우리가 그런 유대를 강화시키는 모든 일들은 매우 중요합니다. 이를 위해, 우리는 시베리아 소비에트 전역을 여행했고, 우리를 가장 고립된 공동체와도 연결할 수 있는 도로 체제을 구축하는데 투자할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_return_to_the_mines_desc: "정상적인 경제 기능이 회복되고, 추가로 공공 재건 계획 형태로 좋게 경제를 자극하면서, 경제는 빠른 속도로 성장하기 시작했습니다. 광물 자원에 대한 수요는 거의 10배 증가했지만, 많은 코뮌들이 이를 제공할 준비가 되어 있지 않는거 같습니다. 독일 폭격기들이 큰 규모의 채굴 광산들을 파괴한다는 위협이 사라지면서, 지금은 이전에 폐쇄되었던 광산을 다시 열기에 좋은 시기인 것 같다. 게다가, 우리는 새로운 광산 장비를 제조하고 광업에 쉽게 접근 가능한 코뮌에 그 장비들을 배포할 시기입니다."
 SBA_second_dedicated_agricultural_production_desc: "우리의 코뮌들은 날이 갈수록 더 커지고 있습니다. 우리의 코뮌들이 매일 한 가정들에게 제공하는 영양과 경제적 안정은 출산률에 뚜렷한 영향을 끼치고 있습니다. 이 점을 염두에 두고, 우리의 농업 생산량을 늘리는 것이 옳아보입니다. 결론부터 말하면, 기계화된 농업 장비를 농업 생산량을 높히기 위해 생산하고 코뮌에 분배되어야 합니다. 이것은 우리의 농부들이 더 많은 생산품을 생산하는데 도움을 줄 뿐만 아니라, 우리 노동자들이 다른 일을 할 수 있는 자유 시간도 줄 것이다."
 SBA_second_rural_production_nodes_desc: "아나키즘 사회의 핵심은 도시나 교외에 있는 것이 아니라 시골 마을과 그 안에 있는 지역 사회에 있습니다. 이러한 공동체들이 도시의 제조품에 대한 의존을 끝내도록 돕는 것은 우리의 중요한 목표입니다. 따라서, 우리는 코뮌 스스로 생산품을 생산할 수 있도록 지역 작업장의 개발을 장려할 것입니다. 또한 이러한 코뮌을 통해 공동체들은 칼라시니코프의 총기장 같은 것이 바로 뒷마당에 있기 때문에 더욱 쉽게 무장할 수 있을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_foundation_laid_desc: "많은 사람들이 불가능하다고 생각하는 아나키즘 실험을, 우리는 반박하며 우리의 이데올로기가 우월하다는 것을 몇 번이고 계속 증명하고 있습니다. 우리의 도덕성을 손상시키지 않고, 우리는 생산수단을 통제하는 소수의 특권층없이, 모든 사람들에게 이익을 주는 경제체제를 만들 수 있었습니다. 우리는 모든 러시아 인민들을 위한 경제적 기반을 다진 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_grey_area_desc: "완벽한 이 세계에서는, 부유한 부자들이 선호하는 국가와, 그들을 지배하는 부패하고 불공정한 국가에 대한 인민들의 대답으로써, 아나키즘 사회가 자연스럽게 생겨날 것입니다. 그러나 현 상태를 보면, 인민들이 당초 예상보다 그들의 국가에 더 애착을 가지고 있는 것처럼 보이고, 그러한 인민들이 사는 많은 국가들은 우리의 존재 자체를 문제 삼고 있습니다. 개개 코뮌들은 이들의 침략을 물리칠 수 없기 때문에 우리가 살아남으려면 중앙집권적인 군대가 필요합니다. 그러나 그런 기구들은 아나키즘의 근본과 모순되지 않나요? 게다가, 얼마나 민주적인지에 상관없이 모든 코뮌들을 지배하는 중앙 평의회는 아나키즘의 이상에도 반대하지 않나요? 우리의 이념적 핵심을 배반 했다고 할 수준으로 우리의 뿌리로부터 멀어지려면 어느정도 멀어져야 할까요? 중앙정부가 아닌 코뮌들과 개인에게 어디까지 그 권리가 허용되어야 하는지 정확히 짚고 넘어가야 할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_delegate_industrial_administration_desc: "공산주의의 핵심은 생산수단을 인민에게 돌려주는 것이 목표인 이념입니다. 중앙집권적인 정부에게 경제를 통제하게 하는 것은 이 목표와 완전히 모순됩니다. 따라서 우리 경제의 효율성을 향상시키기 위해서는, 우리는 대신 몇몇 공동체로부터 산업 평의회를 만들어, 가능한 산업적 개선과 투자 할만한 지역의 목록을 만들고, 그 목록을 각 코뮌의 지방 평의회에 제출하여 검토해야 합니다. 그리고 산업 평의회는 또한 소외된 코뮌들에서 산업 건설 계획을할 수 있도록 정해진 양의 자본을 배정받게 될 것입니다."

However, our work does not stop here, as there is much to be done. Firstly and most importantly, many new villages, towns, and even cities have come under our control, and we must work to help organize all of our new lands into proper communes. Furthermore, we must begin the long process of helping the people acclimate and understand why anarchism is the proper future of Russia.\n\nLurking and mostly unspoken is the fear that the Siberian Soviet will be subsumed by the Black Army, leading to the anarchist dream falling into the trappings of a military junta. While some of these fears may have merit, we can hopefully find a solution that allows for us to maintain freedom while preventing chaos!"
 SBA_regional_consolidate_the_regional_courts_desc: "The new territories under our control have to be consolidated and reformed into proper anarchist communes. The solution, at first glance, is to simply let the people organize themselves into communes. However, while this may seem simply easy on paper, the actual process over this reformation has caused quite the ideological debate. The people of Central Siberia have never lived under an anarchist society, and likely have no idea how to organize themselves. Furthermore, it is also likely that there are too many who still wish to see our dream foiled. Therefore, we are left with a choice. Do we allow the people to self-organize, as our ideology tells us to, or do we have the Black Army provisionally lead these lands until they are ready to properly organize?"
 SBA_regional_instate_provisional_leadership_desc: "Despite our hopes otherwise, the leaders of the SIberian Soviet know the truth. Too many of the people in the newly conquered lands are opposed to anarchism as of right now, and letting the people self-organize would only invite sabotage. While it might sting, we have no choice but to let the Black Army provisionally lead the new lands until we can be certain that the people are ready to self-organize. It may seem contradictory, but we have to do this for the sake of the revolution. With luck, the people will acclimate to anarchism quickly and control can be handed over properly to the future anarchist communes, preventing the authority of the Black Army from becoming too entrenched."
 SBA_regional_faith_in_the_newly_integrated_desc: "To let the Black Army control our new lands would be nothing but an absolute betrayal of our ideology! It may seem inane, but allowing the Black Army to control our new lands sets a bad precedent. After all, if we expand farther, why shouldn't the Black Army control those new lands until the people are acclimated to anarchism? In any case, showing that we don't trust the people undermines anarchism here in Siberia as a whole. After all, one of the major tenets of anarchism is mutual cooperation, and failing to extend a hand in trust does nothing but sabotage our hopes from the very beginning! There may be those who are unwilling to self-organize, but through proper execution of anarchist ideology as compared to throwing the army around like a fascist state, we can forge an anarchist society that is truly free!"
 SBA_regional_strike_the_balance_of_power_desc: "The Black Army is undeniably a powerful authority, and we've had to rely greatly upon them throughout all of our struggles and expansion. Such a reliance is worrying to many, and the fears of the Black Army eventually forming a military junta in all but name are widespread. Of course, we cannot allow such a tragedy to occur, especially after coming so far. To prevent the Black Army from controlling too much power, we must take efforts to reinforce the soviets and communes. Strengthening the civilian councils, combined with transferring Black Army tasks to other, more representative organs will allow us to maintain our anarchist ideals even in the fact of threats!"
 SBA_regional_extend_the_communication_systems_desc: "One of the biggest issues that we have encountered in our expansion is a lack of communication ability. It can take days, even weeks to find out about various events that occur in the more rural areas. Furthermore, the need for better communication and coordination with our rural comrades is critical in this time of reorganization, as access to superior resources and ending any lurking threats are matters of the utmost importance. This communication expansion will be done by extending telegraph lines, building new radio towers, and constructing a modern phone system, allowing us to reach even the most isolated of communities. No longer will we be left in the dark when it comes to rural matters!"
 SBA_regional_correct_the_misguided_teachings_desc: "Education is undoubtedly the foundation of our future. After all, it is education that instills values in the youth, and it is education that people refer back to throughout their life. While there are aspects of the old Soviet and CSR teaching that were taught correctly and properly, there are many other aspects that must be retaught to the populace in order for them to become model anarchists. Most importantly, we must highlight the failures of the states to bring long-term stability and peace to central Siberia, and similarly showcase how anarchist thought will succeed where the puppet democracy and statist thought has failed. It may take time, but the people will finally understand the truth of anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_cast_down_social_injustice_desc: "Throughout the centuries, the Russian states in whatever form they may have taken have created a culture of inequality. Women are, more often than not, seen as inferior to men, and consigned to be housewives. People of other races have faced similar criticism, being viewed with suspicion for no other reason than prejudice. However, the group who has had it the worst of all are homosexuals. They barely have even a right to exist, with many having persecuted those unlucky enough to be revealed. Such prejudices have no place in an anarchist society. We must work to break the chains that shackle our women, show people that race is merely appearance and nothing more, and allow our homosexual comrades to finally be able to freely love whomever they want!"
 SBA_regional_enshrine_the_material_rights_desc: "Every human, no matter what, deserves the right to live. Of course, one cannot merely just live. People require material resources such as food and water. In order to ensure that we truly uphold the right of everyone to live, we must also ensure that everyone, no matter who they are, has access to the necessities of life. In order to ensure this, we must help ensure that the communes are always able to provide whatever is necessary for people to live. Obviously, we will inform the communes of their duty, but we will also remind them that they have access to aid from the greater communes if need be. We will ensure that life is able to prosper under anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_establish_the_provisional_resource_council_desc: "With our access to new lands and resources, many comrades have pointed out a need to properly coordinate said resources so that the communes can properly function. To this end, we shall establish the Provisional Resource Council. This Council's main function will be ensuring the extraction and distribution of all resources within the Free Territory. To this end, the Council will be composed of workers from resource-gathering industries and representatives from areas who need resources. This Council will hopefully be able to solve any and all needs from the cities and villages involving resource needs, while allowing the workers who produce said resources a place to be heard."
 SBA_regional_the_last_congress_of_kansk_desc: "With the rapid growth of new lands for the Free Territory, it has become clear that a more central location is needed in order for the communes to properly coordinate. However, there are a few issues that still need to be worked out, and we must make sure that the movement of the communal congress to a more central city like Novosibirsk is done officially, through democratic vote. Therefore, we shall hold one final Congress in Kansk, to solve any remaining internal issues, before moving to Novosibirsk!"
 SBA_regional_rectify_the_rural_urban_split_desc: "The first major issue that the Congress of Kansk has chosen to focus on is the urban-rural split. While most of our rural comrades have been able to begin reorganizing the villages into proper anarchist communes, our urban comrades have had difficulties. The large population of the cities combined with the high concentration of people has led to efforts requiring more intensive care and resources in order to succeed. With the consolidation of some of the other new communes, we can afford to devote more time and effort into properly reorganizing the cities. These communal governments, more than anything, will set the model for any future communes. We must try our hardest to truly liberate all of the people who live in the Free Territory and show them the light of anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_honors_for_humanity_desc: "When the Soviet Union fell and the Central SIberian Republic splintered, the people were left adrift, with lawlessness plaguing the land. To deal with the chaos, many people turned to religion, leading to the church becoming a very powerful influence in Central Siberia. While we have no interest in outright banning the church, we must take steps to curb its influence on our populace. We must take efforts to educate the populace about secularism and inspire their hopes in the communes, lessening their dependence on the church for stability. We shall also utilize the church wealth that we have been able to obtain for our own purposes instead of returning it to the church. Such efforts may seem controversial to some of our comrades, but it is necessary to help forge a better society!"
 SBA_regional_present_the_cure_desc: "When the Tsar was deposed, the people turned to another government in the form of the USSR. When the USSR fell, the people turned to yet another government in the CSR. Yet in the end, the CSR fell, like the two governments before it. These states were unable to deal with the problems that plagued Russia, and so they collapsed. However, where statism has failed, anarchism has succeeded! Indeed, in a short period of time, Central Siberia has soared by leaps and bounds! Indeed, it seems that Russia has fallen ill, and anarchism is the obvious cure to its woes! We owe it to be the stalwart doctors that ensure that the cure is properly administered!"
 SBA_regional_liberty_all_encompassing_and_eternal_desc: "With all major issues settled, the last Congress at Kansk has begun to wind down. All major internal issues seem to have been settled, with the creation of communes and councils proceeding smoothly. The Congress shall conclude with the formal vote to have all future meetings be based in Novosibirsk. Against all odds, the Free Territory has not only been able to expand, but prosper and spread anarchism all across Central Siberia! We fought in Ukraine, we fought in Catalonia, and finally, here in Central Siberia, we have succeeded. Freedom has been brought to the people, and a new dawn approaches for the Free Territory. A new dawn in which we are all able to enjoy the fruits of liberty!"
 SBA_regional_develop_the_free_territory_desc: "Our territory was never a major focus for the former Soviet government. While we did receive investment in the form of an expanded Trans-Siberian Railroad and some upgraded machinery for our urban centers, the Soviet Union simply didn't have the time or resources to invest into our home like it did in other regions. This wasn't always meant to be the case, however. The Siberian Plan would have included increased development of our civilian infrastructure, an expansion of the cities, and major investments into our military industrial plants. There would have been almost complete vertical integration of our military industry, from the extraction of unrefined iron in the ground all the way to the manufacture and distribution of Kalashnikovs. While this plan was unfeasible at the time, given our newfound resources, these plans can finally be realized."
 SBA_regional_integrate_the_urban_economies_desc: "Urban areas have always been somewhat difficult to integrate into the communal economy that we practice. Unable to provide food for themselves, oftentimes cities would be able to trade weapons produced in the city for food in the adjacent towns. With the development of localized production of guns in town centers now, this economic balance has been thrown off. In order to compensate for this lost revenue stream for the cities, we must encourage the cities to better utilize their resources, namely their larger skill pool and additional manpower, to produce more specialized items and civilian goods that they can use to continue bringing capital and food into the cities."
 SBA_regional_rebuild_urban_infrastructure_desc: "Though central Siberia was spared from the wrath of the German bombers that plagued the lands further west, its cities have not escaped damage entirely. The collapse of the Central Siberian Republic, and the subsequent wars fought to liberate the region have left the infrastructure of urban centres in dire need of repair. Thankfully, with peace finally brought to Siberia, and the newly-established communes more than willing to begin rebuilding, the task should be easily completed."
 SBA_regional_re_organize_the_industrial_centers_desc: "At its heart, communism is about the community above all else, and the idea that everyone can contribute to a common good. Such an ideal of community is easy to develop in tight knit villages or town communities, but far more difficult in large cities. We must endeavor to promote a feeling of solidarity and brotherhood among citizens living in these cities. Such community begins in the workplace, among your coworkers and colleagues in the factory. In order to achieve this, we will rip out the old ideas of the boss worker relationship and institute a new system of worker self management."
 SBA_regional_establish_the_council_of_trade_unions_desc: "Though many trade unions existed in central Siberia prior to the Black Army's triumph over the region's warlords and despots, they are in much need of reform. The Kostinsty, for example, are too fond of Bolshevism to be entrusted with the influence they currently have, while the rest are too small-scale to unite all workers across Siberia. Thus, an official council, endorsed and supported by the Security Council, must be established to unite all unions and prevent authoritarians from subverting their ranks."
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_kostinsty_desc: "The Kostinsty are a militant worker's organization that have existed in the area before we arrived. While our politics are not perfectly aligned, with their leadership seemingly leaning towards pre-war Bukharinist philosophy as opposed to our more radical anarcho communist policies, their organizational expertise and influence could prove incredibly useful to us. Their leadership has indicated that they are not opposed to working alongside us, and have offered assistance in the implementation of our redesigned Siberian Plan. We would be fools not to accept their offer."
 SBA_regional_the_bounty_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "The Siberian Plan is almost complete. Already thousands of industrial machines, distributed across the whole of Siberia both to cities and towns alike, are being installed and tested for the first time. Electrical light is beginning to shine in places that had never so much as seen a light bulb before, just as thousands of positions in new coal plants across Siberia open up. The standard of living for millions across Siberia is about to experience a quantum leap, and in doing so we will thrust ourselves into becoming one of the foremost industrial powers of Russia. At this rate, we may one day eclipse even Germany..."
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_peasant_communes_desc: "Communism is inherently an ideology that favours the community over private individuals. What greater community is there of men and women than that of their whole land? We must encourage isolated rural communities, typically left unrepresented in government, to reach out and join the economic and political scene of the country. While production in a single rural community might be small, if all the rural towns and villages across the Free Territory work together, then they will know true prosperity."
 SBA_regional_develop_the_altai_region_desc: "Altai is a region of great industrial potential. While infrastructure is minimal in the region, its natural resources are practically untapped, and has a large enough population to sustain several mineral extraction and factory sites. Even just the first step to achieving this goal of industrialization within this region, that being laying down railway tracks, should be enough to begin boosting agricultural and mineral output over the course of the next few weeks as we begin pouring resources into the region."
 SBA_regional_facilitate_rural_mechanization_desc: "One of the important features of communal life is self sufficiency. While this is often not possible, given that more rural communities simply do not have the skilled labour or industrial facilities to produce things like modern electronics or automobiles, we can set these communities up with the means to acquire such items. By facilitating mechanization in the rural areas of the Free Territory, we can help rural communes outproduce their needs, allowing them to exchange the extra produce and livestock for items the rural population cannot obtain. Not to mention, having an agricultural surplus will be useful for expanding the population."
 SBA_regional_ensure_rural_interconnection_desc: "There are rural regions of the free territory that are simply unfit for major industrialization and expansion. These regions are either too isolated, or not populous enough, or are in an area vulnerable to foreign invasion. For these areas, the best we can do is extend infrastructure to connect their territories to our own. This can be done in a variety of ways, from building actual roads or railroads, to setting up phone lines or the simpler telegraph lines, to extending the power grid into their territory. This won't provide manufacturing jobs for these people, but it will hopefully allow them to attain somewhat of a higher standard of living."
 SBA_regional_enlightenment_for_all_desc: "While Russia has been embroiled in the constant civil wars and skirmishes that have resulted because of this warlordism, the superpowers of the world have been advancing their technological arsenal. From the space race to the development of transistor computing, they have expanded their computational, agricultural, and industrial output tenfold, while we have been forced to rely on decades old machinery. If we are to bring ourselves up to their level, we must begin investing into the local schools, universities, and labs in the Free Territory. Giving these centers of learning funding and autonomy is the surest way to raise our educational standard."
 SBA_regional_the_interventionist_approach_desc: "All around Russia there are nations with the capability to destroy our nation with the press of a button. Thousands of ICBMs, SLBMs, and IRBMs are armed and ready to rain down atomic fire upon Russia should those nations choose to do so. Even without such weapons, crushing our nation would be easy with modern guns and missiles they have at their disposal. Our technological ability has stagnated heavily since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and that has left our nation vulnerable. While we do not currently possess the technology or skilled technical workers capable of developing these weapons, creating an education system under the supervision of the military council will surely help us begin to bridge the gap in technological ability."
 SBA_regional_trust_in_the_educators_desc: "Some have argued that in order to bring our educational system up to par with our more advanced neighbors, we need to place the educational system under the power of the military council, so that we might bring all students and educators to the same level of educational quality across the board. This is foolish. Different regions will have different needs. Rural villages might want to teach their students about tractor maintenance and engine repair, whereas cities might want to educate their students in power production and computer science. We should trust local educators to decide on a curriculum that benefits their community's needs."
 SBA_regional_inspire_progressive_thought_desc: "Control of education is of the utmost importance to the security of the Free Territory. While the military council would like to leave the communes' educators to their own devices, it would invite subversion and reactionary ideas to be indoctrinated into our nation's youth. Anarchism as a whole would be threatened if the military doesn't step in and prevent its collapse. The fifth column must be stopped. To that end, we will create an all encompassing curriculum that will teach both the basics necessary for the students to function as adults as well as professing the tenets of anarchism."
 SBA_regional_the_right_to_well_being_desc: "Just as Pyotr Kropotkin wrote, vague proclamations of "the right to work" or "to each the whole result of his labour" are insufficient. Not one individual should be left behind in our pursuit of a truly free and equal society. Some may say that the scars of war left on Russia make sacrifices necessary, and inequality an unfortunate fact. We see such excuses as what they are; the lies of an elite class wishing to consolidate the growing wealth of Russia into their own hands. Every kilowatt hour that our energy production grows, every good that leaves the production line, every building that finishes construction should be a victory which the common man can reap the benefits of. Well-being for all is not a dream."
 SBA_regional_provide_schools_for_all_desc: "Education is a powerful tool - the increasing literacy of the European working classes in the 19th century catalysed the growth of socialist movements, as political theory was no longer the domain of intellectuals alone. Not only this, but the education of the masses lead to an unprecedented growth in production and technology. Unfortunately, as a mostly rural and unstable region, central Siberia lacks the school coverage and quality of more developed areas. It is imperative that new schools be constructed to ensure the entirety of our population has access to quality education."
 SBA_regional_expand_research_cooperatives_desc: "Russia has been left behind the rest of the world in many aspects, but perhaps most significantly is in technological progress. While televisions became common for American households, radios were considered a luxury here. While fighter jets were being developed in Japan, we repaired Bukharin-era planes. While Germany stockpiled thousands of nuclear warheads, we are yet to build a single one.\n\nTo remedy this, communal research initiatives must be supported and encouraged greatly. The innovation that brought the Ukrainian Black Army the tachanka must bring ours tanks and jets."
  SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_union_desc: "The Siberian plan has been a greater success than we could have ever thought possible. Even before its completion, industrial productivity across Siberia has grown by over 200 percent. In the past month alone, energy production in Siberia has grown by over 330 million kilowatt-hours, approximately the same amount as the Hoover dam produces every month. And all this has been by the mandate of our Security Council. Voices of fears that such a council might detract from our civil liberties, or even worsen the long term prosperity of our nation are now silent in the face of such great accomplishment."
 SBA_regional_reach_for_the_dawn_desc: "Rigid economic planning both restricts the rights of our citizens, and harms our economy long term. If we truly wish to see Russia prosper, and the glory of communism prevail, we must abandon these authoritarian ideas of controlling the economy through the state. Bukharin tried, and failed. If we wish to see true prosperity, we must allow worker's organizations and unions to decide for themselves what to produce as a natural reaction to the needs and demands of society and the economy. While some decry such a system as capitalism under another name, we reject such a title. This is a true socialist economy."
 SBA_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc: "The Free Territory's borders are always at risk. Warlords, bandits, and raiders stand ready to raid and loot our cities and towns at the drop of a dime. It has become necessary to begin reforming the militia into a fully fledged army. In order to achieve this, we will need to invest into more specialized equipment, like anti-tank, anti-air, and sniper weapons, in order to increase our army's effectiveness. Additionally, we will need to begin increasing the discipline of our army. These men can no longer simply be volunteer farmers, they must be soldiers, and we will drill this into them."
 SBA_regional_maintain_the_flawless_legacy_desc: "We cannot abandon our roots. The militia organization that is the Black Army is one that is for and by the people. We cannot go back upon this legacy now. Abandoning this legacy would mean fundamentally changing the foundation of our society. Additionally, given that the military is so intertwined with our government, by instituting a top down structure of organization in the Black army, we would be inviting corruption and the threat of coup from the ruling generals in a newly reformed army. For the safety of our anarchic way of life, despite its faults, we must maintain our election based military."
 SBA_regional_welcome_the_rehabilitated_desc: "The Black Army has been supremely successful in its march of conquest across Siberia, but cracks are starting to show in the army. Our manpower reserves have been slowly atrophied as our reunification efforts have progressed, and we may not be able to rely on our home communes for many more men. In order to rectify this, we should begin integrating conquered militaries into our ranks. Not only would it alleviate our manpower issues, but it would also ease integration of their territory into ours considerably."
 SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_liberation_war_desc: "The wars we have fought in our efforts to reunify Russia were not one by sheer brute force and manpower, like those Russia has fought in the past, but rather with the cunning and finesse of smart generals and strategic thinking. We can use these reports and plans and draw on the experience of these generals and commanders to continue developing the military doctrines the old Soviet government had begun developing in the Second World War. Already, we have begun collecting and teaching the strategies used in the previous conflicts in our military schools."
 SBA_regional_industrial_warfare_desc: "The Great War of so many decades past was catastrophic not only in its casualties, but also in its material consumption. The lesson had been learned by all nations of the world after the war. The development of heavy artillery, tanks, and aeroplanes meant that wars of the future would demand a strong industry to support the militaries of the future. This theory has been proved correct. Our military conquests have only been possible thus far due to the hard workers at home pushing out thousands of guns, artillery, and planes month after month. Unfortunately, the farther our military ventures out into Russia, the large our military needs to become to defend our long borders. Thus, we must expand our military industry to keep pace with our industry."
 SBA_regional_reinforce_the_soldiers_desc: "The military machine continues to demand more and more manpower as we spread out across Russia. In order to sate this demand, we must boost recruitment in newly conquered territories. While volunteers have always been welcome from newly integrated territory, the amount of volunteers joining up was always tiny. Simply put, conquered peoples do not take well to their conquerors, even though we have afforded these people almost complete autonomy. We must begin a mass recruitment drive in the new communes and endear ourselves to the populace. With hope, we should see increased enlistment in the new territories."
 SBA_regional_following_the_falcon_desc: "Defeating Novosibirsk was no simple task. While their army might not have been as strong as ours, their air force certainly outshined ours. We suffered far too many casualties at the hands of enemy air support to ignore this problem any more. Thankfully, we no longer need to. Novosibirsk is home to one of the largest aircraft production plants in all of Russia, and consequently is also home to one of the largest air fleets in Russia. Additionally, this fleet will be serviced by some of the best plane mechanics in Siberia. The Free Territory takes another step into modernity."
 SBA_regional_black_wings_above_desc: "The Black Army has had little experience with aerial warfare in the past. While we have used some planes in combat in the past, simply put, we didn't have the industrial capacity or skilled airmen needed to operate an air force. Given our size and the relative strength of our enemies however, we must create and integrate a true air force into our military forces. We have a vast array of former pilots to educate the next generation of airmen, somewhat modern designs for airplanes, and the industrial capacity to begin manufacturing said airplanes."
 SBA_regional_experimental_helicopter_designs_desc: "Helicopters are one of the many technological advances made by the world while Russia regressed into infighting and warlordism. These strange flying devices are unlike airplanes of the past, in that they use a vertical rotor liftoff system whose benefits include aerial attacks on ground targets and even transporting troops and supplies to areas where a landing strip is not available. The devices have great potential, as seen from their performance in the South African War, and domestic development has already begun."
 SBA_regional_past_the_tachanka_desc: "Modern armoured and motorized technology has once again changed warfare for Russia. Formerly, our design had revolved around building large amounts of cheap tanks to overwhelm the German enemy. While tank production never reached the amounts needed to truly test this military doctrine, many generals had supported the idea of simply overwhelming their enemies. However, research into the tanks doctrines of Japan and Germany have indicated a focus on mobility and quality. We should strive to learn from their doctrines and designs and update our armoured and motorized military tactics."
 SBA_regional_tanks_for_peace_desc: "If Russia learned anything from the German invasion two decades ago, it was the utility and efficient brutality of mechanized warfare. Russian troops were cut up and overwhelmed by the speed and explosive power that panzer divisions had at their disposal. The failure of Bukharin to build a tank force capable of protecting the Soviet Union will not be repeated. Our neighbors have surely come to the same conclusions as us. Developing an armoured corps for the Black Army must become a priority if we wish to secure our borders."
 SBA_regional_compile_the_strategies_desc: "Despite recent efforts to reform the army and enforce some form of basic military doctrine, many officers end up implementing their own tactics or offensive strategy many times in opposition of what might be optimal. We should endeavor to create a unified military doctrine that our officers can follow in order to further whatever grand strategy is being implemented during any wars we might be involved with in the future. This will allow us to get a better understanding of how the war is going and as to the capabilities of our troops, instead of simply hoping that an officer makes the right decision."
 SBA_regional_military_egalitarianism_desc: "One of the most outstanding features of the Black Army was its democratic military structure. Unlike most every other army, power was derived not from the top, among the generals and highest ranking military leaders, but rather from the lowest soldiers, who elected their own officers and promoted those who they thought were best equipped. The generals at the top of the military command structure are considered no more equal in terms of value than any other man in the military, and it is precisely because of this that our men fight as hard as they do."
 SBA_regional_the_tomsk_firearms_collective_desc: "While the people of Tomsk are well suited to our style of democracy, having already had local democratic structures they could use, they have yet to adopt the gun culture so vital to our defense. People either do not have the interest or the money to purchase weapons, and most did not feel the need to have one, feeling that their armies would protect them. Our presence here indicates that this was obviously not true. Thus, we should create an organization to educate the people of Tomsk as to the need and operation of guns."
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_liberation_desc: "The ultimate duty of Black army must be to spread our anarchist way of life to all of Russia, so that the peoples of creeds might be freed from the tyranny of states. More so than defense, we must prepare ourselves to be on the offense. Traditionally, conscripts signed up for the Black Army in order to defend our homes, not conquer others. We must convince them that in order to defend ourselves, we must liberate everyone else. Soon, all of Russia will fly the black flag."
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_self_defense_desc: "The purpose of our militias have always been to protect, not to harm. The Black Army is not like the terrorizing force of Yagoda. They fought for domination and power, we fight for peace and bread. Our past conquests should have little bearing on our future. In order to preserve the dignity and integrity of the Siberian Black Army and the Free Territory, we must prevent ourselves from following down the same tyrannical path our predecessors did, and perhaps in doing so we might finally find prosperity."
 SBA_regional_looking_outwards_desc: "Geopolitics is a game of diplomacy and tact just as much as it is armies and wars. In order to secure the Free Territories, we must assess our standing with our neighbors to the west and the east to assess whether they are a threat to us or not, and if they are to assess how much of a threat they pose. And, should we find ourselves to be fortunate to share a border with a nation friendly to the Free Territory, arranging some trade deals or defensive pacts might serve to benefit our interests."
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_liberation_desc: "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of global liberation. If an opportunity to support our fellow socialists or anarchist friends abroad, we should seize the opportunity to do so. Arms, funding, technology... If there exists a need, we shall strive to provide for it. Let us be the kindling that sparks the flames of revolution in all nations. It may cause us to lose reputation among our global peers, perhaps even spark aggression on their part, but if we can help liberate even one oppressed peoples, then we will know that our efforts have not been in vain."
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_protection_desc: "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of protection. The last thing we need is to anger the likes of Japan or Germany and spark another war to devastate Russia. Should the socialists and anarchists liberate themselves from their oppressors, or begin a campaign to do in their own nation, they will have our full support, but not our weapons. Besides, nothing good can ever come of intervening in a foreign conflict. Just look at the United States, it's doubtful they ever expected to be in South Africa as long as they did."
 SBA_regional_exporting_the_revolution_desc: "In order to support our socialist and anarchist friends around the world, we will need to first find them. A new organization will be created, clandestine in nature and global in scale. Its purpose? To find and aid the revolutionaries of the world, even the ones that don't yet know they are yet. From just beyond our borders to the farthest reaches of Africa and South America, our men will be there, providing both the means and motivation for the people to liberate themselves. Some might call it propaganda, we prefer to call it the truth."
 SBA_regional_declare_a_safe_harbor_desc: "The world has become a harsh place. Across the world, individuals are being persecuted for race, religion, ideology, you name it. The Free Territory isn't like that. We are one of the few nations on Earth that can profess to be truly free. We must open our borders to the world and become the safe harbor of the world. So long as you do not intend to cause harm or havok within our borders, you are welcome to join our grand experiment. Additionally, immigration has its own benefits for us as well. The more numerous we are, the better we can protect ourselves."
 SBA_regional_an_eye_to_the_world_desc: "Russia is a harsh mistress, and our neighbors are even harsher. We need to know what they are doing at all times in order to defend ourselves. To that end, we must create some kind of clandestine organization to achieve this end. Should our neighbors begin mobilizing against us, we will know. If our neighbors develop new tanks and aircraft, we will know. If the leader of our neighbour country goes to walk his dog, we will know. With this new agency, the Black Army will have a hand in every folder and an eye on every nation."
 SBA_regional_solidarity_with_the_world_desc: "Building a spy agency is no simple task. It requires time and patience to build something so large and important in secret. Decisions to be made, directions to take. For example, defensive intelligence organizations are often operated and structured differently than more aggressive intelligence services. A focus on long term infiltration and surveillance may be more important than foreign instigation and smuggling. Neither choice is poor, just a different way in which to allocate your resources."

 SBA_power_struggle_siuda_winning_a_game_i_was_never_playing_desc: "As the Siberian War has drawn to a close, it was expected that the cessation of official hostilities would mean the end of hardship for the Free Territories, and a new period of integration and further unification could begin. However, life is never so easy.\n\nAs Stepanov has begun to establish his own sphere of influence in the former Far Eastern territories, it has become clear as to just how much of a threat this developing struggle may become. As the frontiers across the Baikal have become hot with the power struggle of the traitorous Stepanov, it is now obvious that action must be taken.\n\nWhile Siuda has been shocked by this sinister betrayal -and from his inner circle no less- his determination remains resolute as ever. If Anarchism is to survive, Siuda must persevere. Siuda will need to play Stepanov's game in this struggle, lest anarchism dissolve forever."

With the overthrowing of the corrupt system with the February Revolution, the system should have stayed buried. How it has sprung up in the Far East is beyond most any anarchist. It is high time that the people of Chita are reminded why the system had ended in the first place, and reveal to them the best aspects of anarchism.\n\nIf we hope to show the people of Chita just how much anyone can accomplish when cooperating with their neighbor, we will need to give them a beacon to anarchism. Coincidentally, we may be able to dispose of the last monument to monarchism, as well as enlighten the people of Chita.\n\nThrough renovating and retrofitting the Tsar's palace, we will be able to convert the building into the meeting place of the city's council. As well as killing two birds with one stone, the propaganda value of this renovation will be priceless, certainly swaying much of the populace towards true anarchism."

The most despicable ideology, that which was responsible for endless death and destruction, not to mention the dissolution of Russia, found a foothold in Amur. How this came to be has continued to be a mystery, though time is short, and action must be taken.\n\nSiuda has opted to begin a campaign of de-Nazification of the region surrounding Amur. While this program is directed towards bringing the population of Amur closer to the true meaning of anarchism, we must also use it as a tool to dismember the image of Nazism within the Free Territories. One of the foremost propaganda objectives, however, will be to take out the neon swastika taken from Harbin, and to record blowing up the swastika for propaganda distribution. Simply to ensure the metaphor is not lost on anyone."

As the people of the port city starved and froze in the streets, the fascists sat upon their mountain of riches and American funding. No more will the people of Magadan suffer under this injustice.\n\nIn an effort to root out the fascists and restore power to the people, we must redistribute the arms imported from America, and ensure that all within the port city are aware of the misdeeds done to them by the fascists of years past. Reminding them that those years are passed, and the best is yet to begin will only bring the city onto the side of Siuda."

 SBA_power_struggle_siuda_remember_the_tyrant_desc: "Throughout the wastes of the Far East, you can ask any opponent of authoritarianism as to who Genrikh Yagoda was, and they will tell you of the remnants of the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic of years past. They will tell you of the securocratic measures implemented without end in sight. They will tell you of the NKVD kicking down doors in the night, all in the name of a doomed nation. They will tell you of the Siberian War against the Central Siberian Republic, doing nothing but wearing both nations down to nothing, and devastating the birthplace of Siberian anarchism. Why, then, do the people of Irkutsk continue to think of the madman fondly?\n\nIt is something of a mystery, that is without question, though now is not the time to ponder why some may idolize the tyrant, so much as it is to strike these memories down. Those that do not remember the worst excesses of the NKVD will be shown how horrific Yagoda's reign was, whether or not they want to hear it."

Leading this brave rebellion was a man known as Valery Sablin, and his intentions were once pure. However, as soon as this man gained an inch of power, he betrayed his beliefs. Enacting conscription, the elimination of his political enemies, and countless other oppressive acts, it would not take long until Valery Sablin closely resembled the very man he meant to oppose. Even now, there are those in Buryatia who continue to celebrate the actions of Sablin. This must come to an end.\n\nJust as a supposed "Second Red October" occurred within Buryatia, there must be a counterbalance to this horrible misjudgment; the first Black October will occur within the city, and all will know of the wonders of anarchism."

While religion is entirely legal within the Free Territories, the notion of giving any kind of power to the church is an uncomfortable notion to many within the communes, up to and including Siuda himself. Of course, those of the northern Siberian wastelands do not share our sentiment. If we hope to bring them onto our side, we will need to strike a compromise with the local communes.\n\nWhile this will likely do plenty for our popularity, it may not be enough to bring all of the region to our side. As a result, it has been decided that Siuda will begin a variety of charities during his trip to the north. With a little bit of luck, it may be enough to bring the north onto our side."

As his position is vital to the maintenance of the Free Territories, the expansion of anarchism across Siberia has necessitated the inclusion of new additions to the position, such as Vasily Shukshin, and the establishment of a new board, that being the "Communal Economic Directive Board." As this system is both powerful and apolitical, it can easily make or break the destiny of anarchism.\n\nOf course, we would much prefer if anarchism would survive.

With her experience and skill as a writer, Taratuta may prove invaluable in this ever-present power struggle.\n\nBeing the skilled writer that she is, it would be far from a challenge to write a children's book on the adventures of... a character fighting for the dreams of anarchism... in a fantasy world, against the vile... dragon who would want otherwise for the people of Russia.\n\nIn due time, this piece will surely become a best-seller."

In the face of anarchism's greatest threat, however, alliances cannot be determined by a friendship or lack thereof.\n\nSiuda will host a private meeting with Valenteev and will do his damnedest to shore up support in favor of true anarchism.

Over the past decade within the Siberian Black Army, Ivan Stepanov's goal has not shifted in the slightest, and he has slaved to acquire power within the Free Territories. As the Far East lays open with potential, and Siuda's populism has yet to take hold of the region, the way lays open for a new age of anarchism.\n\nThe game is afoot. May Stepanov lead Russia with strength, and strike hard against the weak anarchists of Siuda's following."

This collection of officers, Generals, Field Marshals, and government officials have all maintained a position of power one way or another, and continue to maintain a position of power.\n\nOf course, if we hope to establish any kind of a foothold in Chita, we will begin the standard procedures of wining and dining these aristocrats. Assuming all goes well within the city of Chita, a new stronghold to Stepanov's influence will be established, and Siuda's anarchism will come one step closer to disappearing into nothing."

This subordinate has approached Stepanov with a wondrous deal of grand potential. As there remains plenty of resources in the arsenal of these blackshirts, they have offered to provide the efforts of Stepanov and the Black Army with files on the RFP, white emigre donations and wealth, and muscle, should it come to that, in exchange for becoming the governors of Amur once more following the success of Stepanov's coup.\n\nWhile the legitimacy of these blackshirts are undoubtedly still up in the air, we may have no choice but to accept this deal, for both lack of alternatives and lack of reasons to refrain from accepting such a perfect deal."

 SBA_power_struggle_stepanov_the_cowards_foundation_desc: "One of the greatest failings of the RFP within Magadan was that they relied far too heavily on foreign, unreliable troops. Mercenaries, more specifically. As the armies of Matkovsky's state have proven insufficient to lead a nation as a whole, we may be able to use the mercenaries for a more specialized use.\n\nSince the total annihilation of the Far East, the mercenaries of Magadan have been spread across the region like dust in the wind, though remain open for business from the sounds of things. Should we hope to establish ourselves as a proper, professional force, we need to bring these disparate elements into our sphere. Soon enough, a new army of bodyguards and personal security will join the ranks of the Black Army, dedicated to the survival of the Free Territories."

Assuming that these ex-NKVD hold no quarrels in keeping the spirits of the army high -no matter the exact army or cause- then the Siberian Black Army will find itself far stronger than before.\n\nOf course, few soldiers of the NKVD will be persuaded to join Stepanov's cause, though we have a tool for bringing those uncertain soldiers on side. Should these ex-NKVD decide to join Stepanov's army, we will do what can be done to bring these brave soldiers a life of luxury and pleasure, so long as they manage to aid in suppression efforts whenever needed."

Unfortunately for Ivan Stepanov, he knows he lacks skill in the first point thanks to his proficiency in the second. Similarly clear to Stepanov is the one thing that seems to work well with the people of Buryatia; populism.\n\nSomething which is known to all those within the Black Army is the simple fact that we cannot allow for Siuda to reach the region before we do. If so much as a whisper from Siuda reaches the other side of the Baikal, we may completely lose Buryatia. This can not happen. Even if Stepanov is incompetent with speeches, so much as even a bad speech will run laps around the notion of simply letting Siuda take hold of the region."

Siuda would try to trick these northerners into thinking that he doesn't despise the very notion of religion, though we know that this is clearly not the case. If anyone is going to warn the north wasteland of Siuda's intentions, then it is us.\n\nIvan Stepanov will visit northern Siberia, and inform them of Siuda's horrible beliefs, of strictly enforced state atheism, and of oppressing the north into the Free Territories. While the legitimacy of these claims is up to debate, it will be the responsibility of our own brave leader Stepanov to warn his fellow Orthodox Christians of the evils of anarchism."

 SBA_power_struggle_stepanov_return_to_form_desc: "Throughout Ivan Stepanov's adventures throughout the Far East, instability and anger have been growing at home, as his attention has been called away from suppressing the excesses of anarchism. Within the city of Tomsk, protests have been mounting and mounting since the Siberian Black Army has encroached further on the state apparatus of the Free Territories, as well as demanding for Stepanov's return to Central Siberia.\n\nAsk, and the people will receive. As the protests have already been crushed beneath the competent soldiers at home, we now stand with several brave Siberian Black Army members and substantially fewer residents to the city of Tomsk. For these soldiers which operated as instructed, it is high time that we reward them for their efforts. Such is the reward for those who support the interests of Stepanov, and we are liable to distribute countless more medals over the coming months."

In spite of neither one being true anarchists, and doing no more than lip service to anarchism, the pair have become invaluable to the state of the military. That is where their similarities end, however.\n\nAs Stepanov has worked tirelessly to become the preeminent leader of the Free Territories, Mishurenko has instead labored to prepare the Siberian Black Army to retake Russia from the Germanic occupiers. Regardless of differences, however, it is clear that Stepanov's past efforts to court Mishurenko must come to a head, otherwise, Stepanov will forever lose out on a close ally."

With his staunch beliefs in anarchism seemingly unshakeable in tenacity, Stepan Valenteev has only weakened our position within the Siberian Black Army. While the most apolitical of all military men in the Free Territories, Valenteev only continues to be the only remaining potential ally to Siuda. As we approach the final days until a clear victor is decided, it is clear that we only have so much time. Due to his strong ideological convictions, we have no way to bring Valenteev onto our side, not with the time we have. The solution, then, is simple.\n\nValenteev is too powerful, too ideologically opposed, and too far into Siuda's sphere that there is no longer anything that can be done for him. It is such a shame that there happens to be a plot of a... radical, extremist anarchist who is looking to rid the Siberian Black Army of all statism.\n\nSuch a shame for Valenteev."

Not anymore.\n\nStepanov has spent his whole life fighting for this day. Every objective, duty, and ambition has been nothing but a byproduct of his hope to lead Russia. Through the corrupt, dysfunctional anarchism which stands in his way, Ivan Stepanov holds no regret in his heart, or sadness in his actions. This was the plan, and it progresses without failure, hesitation, or remorse.\n\nAll facets of power lay firmly within the grasp of Ivan Stepanov. Siuda's anarchism has fought him every step of the way, though it was far from enough to stop the inevitable progression of Ivan Stepanov.\n\nMay Russia live forevermore, and may Stepanov take the helm."

The General Assembly assumed that a greater level of interconnection between urban and rural communes would allow resources each are suited for to spread more easily between the two types of commune, Siuda instead argues that such trade actually works to weaken smaller rural communes.

Even if our nuclear stockpile never matches the likes of Germany and Japan, the fact that we can pose an organizational military threat may be enough to protect us."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_king_of_the_anarchic_wastes: "아나키 쓰레기의 왕"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_king_of_the_anarchic_wastes_desc: "It has been a long road to reach this pinnacle of military and social achievement. From the tributaries of the Ob to the shores of Magadan, and from the streets of Tomsk to the peaks of the Verkhoyansk, our Black Army stands triumphant over the entirety of Siberia. Ivan Stepanov has taken our glorious effort to heights undreamt of, and he now reigns as the uncrowned king of this vast territory."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_deliberations_of_stepanov: "스테파노프의 숙고"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_deliberations_of_stepanov_desc: "Now that the Black Army reigns victorious over Siberia, there are important choices to be made. First and foremost, how must this land be governed? In order to shape the future of our territory, we must carefully balance the idealism of the original Black Army with the necessities and responsibilities of great power. Shall Stepanov seize unquestioned control, guiding our territory towards further triumph, but risking backlash for his challenge to our founding ideals? Or should he bide his time, acting with subtlety and paying the proper respect to the traditions which have brought us so far? This choice may determine the future of Siberia."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_put_on_a_good_show: "좋은 공연 하기"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_put_on_a_good_show_desc: "Without a doubt, we will need to tighten our grip on Siberia. But we cannot simply proclaim a dictatorship. The territory would rise up against us in an instant, and our agenda would be dead. Along with us. No, we must act with more subtlety than that. We should work within the established systems and traditions of the Black Army, and only begin sidelining the communes once it's clear that they have no hope of resisting us. Siberia will not be ours overnight, perhaps, but we cannot be rash about this."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_fighting_off_the_vultures: "독수리와 싸우다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_fighting_off_the_vultures_desc: "The Black Army may have conquered the vastest, most unforgiving swath of land on the planet, but there are still many who see us as weak. From the proxies of Japan to the despots of western Russia, there are vultures circling, seeking to peck at our flesh. General Stepanov has therefore decided that the Black Army should begin a new campaign of public strengthening. There will be extensive recruitment drives, bold military exercises near the borders of our enemies, and we will even commission a new series of films for public consumption. The overall appearance will be one of strength, to cow those who would happily see us torn apart. In keeping with our anarchist traditions, of course."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_theres_only_room_for_one_state: "한 국가를 위한 공간만이 있다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_theres_only_room_for_one_state_desc: "Public memory can be a surprisingly malleable thing. Through new propaganda leaflets and posters, as well as some alterations to education curriculums across Siberia, we can start to establish a new version of history. In this new telling, Siuda will be portrayed as a leader who was flawed at best, and whose ambitions would have brought down the Black Army as a whole. Meanwhile, General Stepanov will be portrayed as a visionary anarchist leader. He who controls the past, after all, controls the future. And this shall be our future."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mandatory_freedoms: "의무적인 자유"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mandatory_freedoms_desc: "Years of the Black Army's conflict and struggle have produced a set of traditions forged in blood and fire. These traditions have, over time, solidified into laws customarily obeyed by the many communes of Siberia. Both common administrative law and higher ideals of human rights have been laid out, and it is our job to enforce them. Sending the Black Army, and armed auxiliaries, into the communes will make it clear to all that our territory is governed with both justice and strength. There shall be law, order, and liberty in Siberia, by whatever means are necessary."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_on_every_council: "모든 평의회에 장교를"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_on_every_council_desc: "The Black Army is the backbone of our territory. It has won us dominion over Siberia, and secured the wellbeing of the people against every despotic and reactionary threat. Not every resident of our territories is a soldier, though. Most live humble civilian lives on communes. However, they rely upon us for protection, and as such, we should require that the Black Army have more of a say in the governance of local communes and regions. By requiring every communal council to have at least one Black Army liaison, we can make sure that our interests are represented. It's for the good of all."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_ask_for_permission_first: "권한 요청 먼저"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_ask_for_permission_first_desc: "Years of the Black Army's conflict and struggle have produced a set of traditions forged in blood and fire. These traditions have, over time, solidified into laws customarily obeyed by the many communes of Siberia. However, some of those laws may have to change. By calling a convention of delegates from the many communes and regions, we can create a new code of laws. Such a code would grant us far more legitimacy in the eyes of the people, and is perfectly fitting with the anarchist ideal of the popular will. So long as the process is malleable, we can use democracy to achieve our own ends."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_advisory_communes: "자문 공동체"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_advisory_communes_desc: "The commune system forms the main unit of social order in our territory. Most people, be they farmers, artisans, or educated professionals, live in a commune system. For the most part, these communes have also formed the main unit of governance, with their councils deciding upon the allocation of resources and the administration of justice. However, this cannot stand. With the advent of the Security Council, and the realities of governing as vast a realm as Siberia, one thing is clear: hayseed peasants distributing harvests and levies is no basis for a system of government. The commune governments may have an advisory role, but the leadership of the Black Army will be doing the grunt work of administration from here on out."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_ascendancy_of_military_anarchism: "전위대 아나키즘의 등극"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_ascendancy_of_military_anarchism_desc: "The old traditions of communal governance are all well and good, but the world is a dangerous place. Those who would threaten us must fear our might. While we may fly the black flag, and while our soldiers may cite Bakunin, we are still an army. By blending the ideals of anarchism with dedication to protecting and expanding our gains, the Black Army will triumph. Vanguard anarchism has ascended across our territory, and we will lay down our lives to defend it."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_keeping_the_generals_in_check: "장군들 견제"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_keeping_the_generals_in_check_desc: "The Black Army may be run by those who claim the title of \"anarchist\", but it still has an officer corps. The Security Council is dominated by a handful of these men, a set of generals who have earned the loyalty of their troops through kindness and terror alike. We'll need to deal with them carefully. Each has their own set of flaws, and each their own virtues. And not all are worth keeping around."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_kilchichakovs_greed: "킬치차코프의 탐욕"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_kilchichakovs_greed_desc: "Mikhail Kilchichakov is a liability. At least, that's his reputation. His main motivation for ascending to leadership in the Black Army is greed, and everybody knows it. He skims off the top of budgets and requisitions all the time. With that said, he's also competent. His administrative staff run large swathes of our territory with skill and aplomb, while Kilichichakov himself is a fine general. He will be loyal, useful, and while they may inspire some disgust, his excesses can be easily swept under the rug. Mikhail can be kept, as long as he doesn't prove himself to be more of an embarrassment than an asset."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mishurenkos_toy_soldiers: "미슈렌코의 장난감 병정"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mishurenkos_toy_soldiers_desc: "Androniy Mishuernko is a warmonger. He's proud of it, too. At Council meetings, he often advocates for new enlistment, new equipment, and new offensives against the enemies of the Black Army. A charitable observer might call him enthusiastic. A less charitable one might call him a rabid madman, and we aren't exactly charitable ourselves. Still, Mishuernko is a highly capable general, who is, moreover, fairly loyal to us. Androniy can be kept, as long as his bloodthirsty eccentricities don't push us over the edge. But, what are the odds of that?"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_valenteevs_scheming: "발렌티예프의 계략"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_valenteevs_scheming_desc: "Stepan Valenteev is a threat. There is no escaping it. Valenteev and Siuda were old friends and ideological comrades, and Valenteev likely sees himself as the natural successor. What's more, he's good at his job. Valenteev has distinguished himself on the field of battle, and commands the respect of many of the Black Army's rank-and-file. His experience and capability makes him too dangerous to have around. We must prepare to have him removed from the picture, in a deniable situation. A minor operation gone wrong, perhaps. A friendly fire incident. Something of that nature. The most important thing is that Valenteev must die."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_open_secret: "공공연한 비밀"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_open_secret_desc: "There are times when gradualism is called for. When a course of action must be taken with the utmost precaution, lest that course become uncontrollable.\n\nThis is not one of those times.\n\nThe vast territories of Siberia which have come under our control must be broken to the will of Stepanov. Otherwise, the rabble of the Black Army will come under the control of men like Valenteev. That cannot happen. We must take control of the army and assert control over the BA, the communes, and all within our territory. The people will all say that we are dictators in the clothing of anarchists, but if we triumph, it won't matter what they say."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_greatest_threat_is_inside_us: "가장 큰 위협은 우리 안에 있다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_greatest_threat_is_inside_us_desc: "The General Assembly has been a useful tool for maintaining power in Siberia. However, it is only useful up to a point. Too much dissent and disunity spilling out of the Assembly would pose a major risk to our political efforts. Therefore, we must dissolve the General Assembly and assume greater powers for ourselves."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_targeting_the_next_generation: "다음세대를 목표로"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_targeting_the_next_generation_desc: "Children are, in many ways, more useful than adults. They willl parrot any slogan you feed them, adapt to any situation you place them in, and, best of all, they can conform to any ideology that you steep them in. It is in the youth of Siberia that the future of the Black Army will be found, and it is on the youth of Siberia that our efforts must be focused."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_conscription_lotteries: "징병복권"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_conscription_lotteries_desc: "All true anarchists must be willing to lay down their lives for the cause of the Black Army. If one is unwilling to die for their commune, and for the good of all their peers, then there must be consequences, and the conscription process, regrettable though it may be, is one such consequence. In communities where recruitment of volunteers is insufficient, we will hold lotteries to draft new levies for the struggle against outside tyrants. It will certainly save some money on higher education."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_schooling_required_to_hold_a_gun: "총을 잡는 데 학교 교육은 필요 없다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_schooling_required_to_hold_a_gun_desc: "In the salons of Tomsk, men may have pondered the nature of education, and planned esoteric curricula. But this is not Tomsk. In our territory, one does not need a diploma or certificate to hold a rifle in defense of the Black Army's ideals. Our education system will reflect this. Obviously three-year-olds will be taught to count and so forth, but the only colleges we will need are officer academies. The serpents of reaction will be overcome by our swarms of ants!"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_sack_the_teacher_introduce_the_officer: "교사 해고, 장교 소개"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_sack_the_teacher_introduce_the_officer_desc: "Perhaps education is necessary to a functioning society after all. However, that doesn't mean that we cannot adjust our education policies to suit our most pressing needs. Primary and secondary curricula will be geared towards the skills that our territory needs the most, from engineering to medicine to militant anarchist theory. When the time comes, all students will be prepared for battle against the enemies of the Black Army, and that preparation will have come from the classroom and the training ground alike. After all, there will be no difference between the two."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_school_to_soldier_pipeline: "학교에서 병사로"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_school_to_soldier_pipeline_desc: "Continuing with the program of militarized education, it is vital that we blur the lines between a student and a soldier. This can be done through a variety of methods, but we find it best to introduce new youth programs into schools across the territory. These reserve corps for the training of officers will normalize the ideals of vanguard anarchism, and prepare the youth to kill and die in the wars to come. Plus, it will provide them with something to do on their days off. Idle hands are the devils' playground..."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_freedom_has_its_limits: "자유의 한계"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_freedom_has_its_limits_desc: "Anarchism proclaims itself as the pinnacle of human freedom, and this may be true. However, every society in the history of humanity, even stateless ones, has had to put some limits on freedom. After all, one cannot cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater. To permit infinite freedoms would invite chaos, and anarchism is not chaos. It is the people moving in lockstep towards higher triumphs. Yes, freedom has its limits, and in our territory, that will be clear."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_proclaim_the_necessity_of_continuing_revolution: "지속적 혁명의 필요성 선언"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_proclaim_the_necessity_of_continuing_revolution_desc: "All of our radical changes to the structure of the Black Army have inspired whispers among the common people. They say that we have betrayed all of our ideals, and that there is no hope for an anarchist future anywhere in our lands.\n\nWe can change this.\n\nWe shall, therefore, declare publicly that the goal of the Black Army is continuing revolution, until Russia is liberated. Once Russia is liberated, however, there is still an entire planet that lies shackled by tyranny of all stripes. Man was born free, but from the fields of America to the prisons of Germany, from the cities of Japan's empire to the depths of Africa, he is in chains. So let us go to the people and declare that beyond Siberia, out there, is a new world!\n\nOut there is our destiny."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_leader_to_make_makhno_proud: "마흐노를 자랑스럽게 만들 지도자"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_leader_to_make_makhno_proud_desc: "It is finished. The vast realm of Siberia is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, within our control. In cities, villages, and communal fields alike, the people pledge their allegiance to General Stepanov. Their days are filled with work and strictly patriotic leisure, while their children drill with weapons behind their schoolhouses. Nestor Makhno himself, forefather of our efforts, however flawed he may have been, would be proud of what we have accomplished. Asiatic Russia lies under the flag of the Black Army, and Stepanov sits at the head of it all."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_peoples_stick: "인민의 막대기"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_peoples_stick_desc: "Why did America, that vast colossus of a continental superpower, surrender to Japan?\n\nWhy do the three great powers of the world stay in a perpetual standoff, with knives at one another's throats, but with no will to make the cut?\n\nWhy did the German Civil War inspire so much anxiety among the generals and advisors of the world?\n\nThere is only one reason: nuclear weapons. A power with access to nuclear weapons has the ultimate bargaining chip, and can threaten the annihilation of all with just a knowing word. A united Russia with nuclear weapons would be unstoppable.\n\nWe must have our own."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_zelenogorsk_has_much_to_offer: "젤레노고르스크는 많은 것을 제공한다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_zelenogorsk_has_much_to_offer_desc: "Siberia is well-known for its vast mineral resources, and as such, we have a number of options for where to source materials for our nascent nuclear program. One of the best options, in the view of the program heads, would be the Krasnoyarsk region. It is a fairly populous and industrialized region, and the facilities in the city of Zelenogorsk would be particularly well-suited to our purposes. The supply chains required for nuclear weapons development might be somewhat difficult to deal with, but Zelenogorsk remains the experts' top recommendation."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_black_army_mining_detachments: "흑군 채굴 파견대"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_black_army_mining_detachments_desc: "What with the Black Army's perpetual growth and somewhat bloated nature, we have found ourselves with quite a few soldiers with nothing to do at the moment. One of the best uses for such surplus populations is engaging in vital labor, and our nuclear program provides such an opportunity. While they will never fully replace civilian uranium miners, they will provide an essential boost to production. We can begin sending troops to mining facilities at places such as Khiagdinskoye and Elkon immediately. This is an excellent proposal to deal with any potential labor shortages, and will result in greater efficiency for our nuclear program."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_in_every_mine: "모든 광산에 장교를"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_in_every_mine_desc: "It would appear that tasking soldiers to mine uranium in far-flung parts of our territories was less than ideal for the Black Army's esprit de corps. At the uranium mines in question, there have been reports of work stoppages, violence against supervisors, and rock-bottom morale. While we cannot ameliorate all of the problems that have led to this unrest, we can certainly crack the whip, as it were. We must begin sending new officers to the mines. Those trained in law enforcement and riot control should be prioritized. The uranium must flow, for the good of the Black Army."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_discovery_in_streltsovsk: "스트렐촙스크의 발견"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_discovery_in_streltsovsk_desc: "Far beyond our heartland of central Siberia, near the frontiers we share with the proxies and puppets of the Sphere, is the small mining city of Krasnokamensk. Much of the city's economy is based around the extraction of coal and manganese, but more recently, the mine technicians have come across something new: uranium. In the pits of the Streltsovsk Mine may lie one of Russia's greatest deposits of the stuff. Having access to this would be an incredible boon for our nuclear program. With that said, the mine is in the Far East, well outside our original stomping grounds. This would present new difficulties in mining, transport, and processing, to say nothing of potential labor shortages in a region so recently conquered. The risks of moving our nuclear program east are clear, but the potential rewards are immense."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_statists_of_siberia: "시베리아의 국가 통제주의자들"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_statists_of_siberia_desc: "The abundant resources of the Streltsovsk Mine are undoubtedly a positive for our nuclear program. However, there is one issue hanging over our heads: the Russian Far East was a warzone until very recently. While many of the civilian populations of the region have been integrated successfully, the scars of the fighting with fascists and statist communists alike run deep. We will need to act carefully in the Far East, and navigate the situation with caution."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_earn_your_liberation: "너의 해방을 얻어라"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_earn_your_liberation_desc: "There are still many thousands of captured prisoners from the conquest of the Far East in camps across the territory. Many, especially those from left-leaning factions of the conflict, have joined the Black Army, but many more adhere to various strains of fascism and White monarchism. Maintaining these POW camps is a strain on our resources, and they are a very tempting manpower pool. Furthermore, many of them would welcome the chance to earn their freedom, even if it takes digging up radioactive materials in a godforsaken speck of Central Asia. By giving these prisoners a chance to enter civilian life again, we would be killing many birds with one stone."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_pity_for_tyrants: "폭군에게 동정은 없다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_pity_for_tyrants_desc: "What kind of an idiot would presume that a fascist can be redeemed? There are still many thousand of the bastards languishing in prison camps run by the Black Army, the detritus of fighting in places like Chita, Amur, and Magadan. They can be put to work mining uranium, but let's not kid ourselves. They won't have much of a choice in the matter. Instead, they will be given a taste of their own medicine.\n\nThe fascists would have strapped all of Russia to the yoke of serfdom once again. Let's see how much they like it when the shoe is on the other foot."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_revolution_will_succeed: "혁명은 성공할 것이다..."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_revolution_will_succeed_desc: "Our nuclear weapons program is moving along impressively, with extraction and research efforts continuing to yield results. But it will not be enough. Not yet. For the success of the global triumph of anarchism, our coups de grace must be ready as soon as possible. More miners, more engineers, and more researchers will be tasked to the program. The success of this program will be the highest priority!"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_by_any_means_necessary: "무슨 수단을 써서든"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_by_any_means_necessary_desc: "Our nuclear weapons program has succeeded. Within a matter of weeks, we expect to have our first pure fission bomb complete and ready for testing. While it cannot yet hold a candle to the vast arsenals of America, Germany, and Japan, it would still be a triumph without equal in the annals of Russian military history. The Black Army is about to split the atom, and capture the fearful eyes of the world. Congratulations."
