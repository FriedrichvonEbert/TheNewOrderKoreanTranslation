 UTL_Veli_Rides_Again: "Veli Kayyum Rides Again!"
 UTL_Veli_Rides_Again_desc: "Veli Kayyum was a man of decadence. He was a man who lived life best as he could with all the advantages which corruption would provide, from the free flow of cash to the countless favors which he would be owed. Now, however, he has seen the light of life. He has seen the error of corruption and free luxury. He knows that there are few things better than earning success, not asking and receiving freedoms as though there is no opposition in his way.\n\nLife has granted Kayyum a chance to peer into what a life has in store for those who fight, and he is satisfied beyond measure as to what it can offer him. All that remains is to fulfill his duties to the Legion. To fulfill his duties to Turkmenistan."
 UTL_Black_Dogs: "Black Dogs"
 UTL_Black_Dogs_desc: "The Legion has become a pack of dogs. Betrayed, backstabbed, and left to rot by others, the Turkestan Legion finds itself being kicked to the curb by all those who interacted with it, and finally being left with its blood bubbling from its mouth.\n\nNow, foreign powers reach out to it, asking for its aid, asking for it to fight on behalf of the whims of others. What answer is there to give if not "no"? Now, the Legion finds itself in a position which some would consider being of geopolitical importance, an entrance into Central Asia. The Legion does not care. Now, they bite and snap at those who would hope to strongarm them into their influence. The Legion has taken it upon itself to reject all foreign influence from this moment onwards. After all, the Legion does not fight the battles of others."

 POLITICS_SHER_MUHAMMAD_DESC: "With a stern face, and dark sunglasses, Shir Muhammad-bek Gaza cuts an imposing figure. Few would have expected a mercenary to seize control of the Turkestan Legion. Yet since he emerged from a Russian prison as a boy, he has surprised many who underestimated him.\n\nMuhammad-bek played a critical role in the Fegana Uprising before engaging in guerilla warfare against the Soviet Union. He built an extensive network on the Afghan-Soviet border, and sold information to Turkey, Japan, and Germany. This network was later used by Germany to assist in restoring the former Bukharan Emir to the throne.\n\nFollowing the Nazi victory, Muhammad-bek embraced the life of a mercenary, taking the name "Korşirmat." Yet he realized that it was not wealth he truly sought - but power. This desire led him to the Turkestan Legion - and seized power when the opportunity arose.\n\nNone can say for certain if it was luck, foreign powers, or one of his own schemes that led to his ascent, but it matters not. With the Legion in his grasp, few obstacles stand between him, and a final battle to decide the fate of Central Asia."
 POLITICS_BAYMIRZA_HAYIT_DESC: "The greatest Turkic fighting force in the history of the modern world was assembled and unleashed upon her enemies twenty years ago. And for twenty years, the blood and lives of its brave soldiers has been wasted by its incompetent leadership.\n\nBaymirza Hayit was born in Yargorgan, a small village in what is now Uzbekistan in 1917. From a young age, Baymirza had shown a great deal of interest in literature and matters of the mind, only interrupted by the onset of war and his conscription into the Red Army in 1939, right after he had graduated from Tashkent University. For two years, Baymirza Hayit served the Soviet Union in fighting the Germans, until he was captured by those same Germans in 1941. It would not be the Red Army that would come to define the rest of his life, however, but the Legion formed out of Turkic prisoners of war in Germany. The Turkestan Legion.\n\nThough the Second World War had ended, the task ahead for the Turkestan Legion did not. Under Veli Kayyum's leadership, they re-entered their homeland, but a mixture of sheer incompetence and greed has led to the Legion only controlling a mere fraction of the nation. The Legion's destiny remains unfulfilled, in spite of all that they have collectively sacrificed. Veli Kayyum made much noise about his new plans, the "Yangi Ergenekon" that he had hoped to build, and like every other half-brained scheme he had cooked, it exploded in his face. Now it falls to Baymirza to pick up the pieces and begin the process of fulfilling the grand and glorious Turkic Destiny, the project of unification now in the hands of someone passionate, decisive, and most of all, competent. The path forward is clear, and all that's required now is the strength to see it through to its end."
