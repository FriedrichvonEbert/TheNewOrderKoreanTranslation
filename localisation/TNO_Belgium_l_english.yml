 POLITICS_Leon_Degrelle_DESC:0 "Who would have thought that Leon Degrelle would have made it this far? Not many, least of all the man himself- but he's here now, and he has one chance to succeed.\n\nLeon Degrelle was torn on the German invasion at first, along with his party, but he grew into one of their most ardent collaborators with time. An Iron Cross recipient, a war hero, and a proud advocate of the Wallonian people, suffice it to say that Degrelle was heavily displeased with the news that his lands were to be put under the control of Heinrich Himmler and his acolytes- a displeasure that has only grown with time, as Himmler's spartanist Aryan ideal ground Wallonian culture and independence into the dirt.\n\nAt first, Degrelle tried to covertly undermine Himmler's work, subtly stocking arms and preparing his men for an uprising. This was revealed, despite his efforts to keep it hidden, and Degrelle and his men have been on the run ever since. Even as they have succeeded in hiding from the SS brigades that hunt for them so far, Degrelle knows it's only a matter of time until they find him- an assumption that only deepened when Heydrich emerged victorious in Germany. With no way out, Degrelle and his men were playing for time- that is, until Heydrich broke from Himmler in spectacular fashion, and a faint hint of hope broke through.\n\nIn the chaos of the split, Degrelle and his men have seized Wallonia from Himmler's clutches, setting up their forces for the inevitable counterattack. There is only one hope for the Walloon Division now- that he and Heydrich can come to an agreement, joining forces and fighting off Himmler's assault together. If, for whatever reason, such an agreement falls through, then Degrelle and the Walloon Division will certainly die- and Wallonia may go with them."

 BEL_restorationist_fervor:0 "Restorationist Fervor"
 BEL_restorationist_fervor_desc:0 "Degrelle longs to see Belgium reborn under his own auspices, cleansed of unwanted elements and elevated to the status of equal with the Reich. Such an aspiration seems unlikely in these times, but Degrelle has never been one for action rather than talk."
 
 BEL_high_in_honors:0 "High in Honors"
 BEL_high_in_honors_desc:0 "Degrelle and the Walloon Legion are highly respected within the SS. They are the most famed collaborator legion by far, having proven their valor time and again against the Bolsheviks in both the Second World War and West Russian War."
