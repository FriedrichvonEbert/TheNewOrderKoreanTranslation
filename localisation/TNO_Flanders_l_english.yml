 POLITICS_Bert_Eriksson_DESC:0 "In Flanders fields, the Langemarck Division re-asserts their control over territories they had lost- and prepare to rejoin their Reichsführer.\n\nBert Eriksson is an anomaly in the SS in many ways. The youngest of the major figures in Burgundy today, Eriksson joined the SS as soon as he could, swiftly making his way through the ranks of the Langemarck Division. Even if the troubles of the 50's have blunted his once favorable views towards the economic side of things, he remains one of the most driven collaborators in Burgundy today- reliable, useful, and loyal.\n\nHowever, this loyalty is less driven by a personal liking of Himmler, nor even a particular attachment to the System that the Reichsführer endorses, but rather an intense dislike of his southern counterpart, Leon Degrelle. Eriksson knows that, should he be removed from his position of power, Degrelle and the Walloons will waste no time in seizing Flanders for themselves- something that he refuses to allow. As such, the leader of the Langemarck Division has used shadier methods to boost his division's strength, making under-the-table deals with Breton traders and falsifying resistance attacks to gain aid and strengthen his side.\n\nNow, with Heydrich's split and Degrelle seemingly wavering on the edge of outright treason, Eriksson sees his opportunity arise- and he has no intention of letting it slip away. Soon, he and his men shall join Himmler's forces in one final, crushing strike against Degrelle and his pack of dogs. Then, and only then, will Eriksson know that he has succeeded in keeping the Flemish way of life safe."

 FLR_fearful_victory:0 "The Fearful Victory"
 FLR_fearful_victory_desc:0 "The triumph over degenerated National Socialism was a welcome development to the Flemish SS - but not for long. Now that the final struggle is over, Eriksson has suddenly realized that Flanders is surrounded by prowling wolves, and feels very, very alone."
 
 FLR_eyes_on_the_border:0 "Eyes on the Border"
 FLR_eyes_on_the_border_desc:0 "Leon Degrelle makes no bones about his ambitions; he wants Belgium back together. The Walloon Legion is quite the force to be reckoned with, something Eriksson is acutely aware of. He has thus prepared his SS to defend Flanders at all costs."
