 societal_development.1102.t:0 "Decrease in Poverty"
 societal_development.1102.desc:0 "Thanks to our greater poverty relief efforts, as well as the expansion of our civilian economy, the poverty rate has decreased significantly enough to be notable internationally.\n\nAs our government congratulates itself for its efforts, the first official state projections on the impact of this improved popular prosperity are filed, stating that the people are able to access superior goods, economic opportunity shall be greatly increased, and our workforce shall be capable of greater and greater feats."
 societal_development.1102.a:0 "A toast to our economists!"
 
 societal_development.1103.t:0 "Increase in Poverty"
 societal_development.1103.desc:0 "The men on the streets begging have grown, and grown, and grown. Every day, more boys have to work to support their family. The poverty line, that dreaded point at which a family simply cannot support itself, has become to encompass a larger slice of our populace. This doesn't just result in less consumer spending and stress on our economy, but stress on the systems that hold our state up. Tax income goes down, less are willing to sign up to die in a war when their family is already starving, and the masses cry out."
 societal_development.1103.a:0 "Does anybody have any change to spare?"
 
 societal_development.1104.t:0 "Smarter Academic Base"
 societal_development.1104.desc:0 "Time and time again, societies crumble. All will agree, it is usually a slow, painful process. However, there are many voices of dissent as to the exact cause. One prominent theory is that the foundation of any complex society is education. Molding adolescents to fit a role in any society is key to maintaining it's longevity. \n\nWhen a society experiences conflict, be it economic recession, civil war, or social conflict, money and attention is often drawn away from schooling, creating a vicious cycle that slows down technological progress and discovery and kills curiosity."
 societal_development.1104.a:0 "Towards the future!"
 
 societal_development.1105.t:0 "Dumber Academic Base"
 societal_development.1105.desc:0 "Time and time again, societies crumble. All will agree, it is usually a slow, painful process. However, there are many voices of dissent as to the exact cause. One prominent theory is that the foundation of any complex society is education. Molding adolescents to fit a role in any society is key to maintaining it's longevity. \n\nWhen a society experiences conflict, be it economic recession, civil war, or social conflict, money and attention is often drawn away from schooling, creating a vicious cycle that slows down technological progress and discovery and kills curiosity."
 societal_development.1105.a:0 "Perhaps the children aren't wrong after all..."
 
 societal_development.1106.t:0 "Better Research Facilities"
 societal_development.1106.desc:0 "The money keeps on rolling in, and our scientists are loving it! With the budget of our research and development programs skyrocketing, we've built new research facilities and upgraded our old laboratories. This won't just allow us to be safer when working, but handle more dangerous materials and ensure greater amounts of research to be done. Across the private and public sector, new technologies from military to civilian uses are being developed. Of course, this is good for more than just scientists. Now, citizens will be able to enjoy the boon of research, and economic bonuses like new industrial technology will keep the economy moving!"
 societal_development.1106.a:0 "We'll get back to the schools... eventually."
 
 societal_development.1107.t:0 "Research Facilities Decline"
 societal_development.1107.desc:0 "Laboratories are the backbones of any country's research capabilities. Scientists cannot develop new robots, guns, planes, computers or medicine without complex labs. They are also, however, a massive money sink. It is an unavoidable reality that funding sterile, controlled buildings takes away from national projects that country's may prioritize more. As our nation struggles to properly fund labs due to political corruption and recession, we will see a marked decrease in our research capabilities that may last years."
 societal_development.1107.a:0 "A tragedy. Now, about that new home?"
 
 societal_development.1108.t:0 "Larger Nuclear Stockpile"
 societal_development.1108.desc:0 "When the first nuclear bomb exploded in Hawaii, the world stood in shock. For the first time in history, man had the capability to destroy itself. At the turn of a key and the touch of a button, the culmination of thousands of years of human achievement; art, architecture, science, politics, men, could be destroyed in less than an hour. It was a power once thought unthinkable, relegated to gods. Now, a petty man atop a petty government holds this power. In fact, it has grown, from something catastrophic but not apocalyptic to something one-step closer to world ending. A terrifying development."
 societal_development.1108.a:0 "None shall threaten us again."
 
 societal_development.1109.t:0 "Downsize in Nuclear Stockpile"
 societal_development.1109.desc:0 "Those who saw opportunity in the creation of the atomic bomb also saw terrible consequences. They saw the ability to kill billions manifested in one destructive weapon. They warned that one day it might result in the end of it's builders. For once, we heed their warning. It may have been motivated partially by economic, pragmatic concerns, but it was also motivated by that terrifying possibility. The amount of nuclear missiles, bombs, and weapons in our stockpiles has gone down as some are systematically destroyed through a long, expensive process. The waste has been thrown in a secure center and documents preserved so that in the distant future, men may look upon our decision and learn from it."
 societal_development.1109.a:0 "I am become death, destroyer of worlds."
 
 societal_development.1110.t:0 "Better Industrial Expertise"
 societal_development.1110.desc:0 "New training programs motivated by a need for better workers and managers has resulted in industrial workplaces that are more exact, efficient, and smart in their production of goods. New technologies and equipment are important, but they will never trump the human element, that which is driven by practice and education. These new training programs, motivated by national vocation programs and investments in worker safety programs, have driven our workers further towards true, perfect industrial efficiency. When they clock in, they will become machines of the highest order. That is the goal."
 societal_development.1110.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 societal_development.1111.t:0 "Worse Industrial Expertise"
 societal_development.1111.desc:0 "Yesterday, a man was killed. Not in murder, nor by some horrible disease. He died where he spent most of his waking life, stamping logos onto poorly-constructed mugs. A falsely placed pneumatic tube exploded, sending the conveyor belt's nails and screws across the factory, killing him instantly. His family mourns for something to change, and the manufacturers make a half-hearted apology. Life moves on.\n\nThese are the consequences of declining industrial expertise. Not only poorer goods and slower production, but lives. The government neglected the people it ostensibly serves, instead shifting money to relief efforts or new homes or just plain old corruption. It will have its consequences."
 societal_development.1111.a:0 "Disgraceful."
 
 societal_development.1112.t:0 "Better Industrial Equipment"
 societal_development.1112.desc:0 "The economy is doing great, and new reforms in industrial subsidizing have resulted in the shipping of updated industrial equipment across the country! Products are being produced quicker and cheapeer. The further progress of mechanization into the once-ossified industrial world will prove a boon to worker and manager alike! No more long, horrible hours. No more sub-par products screwed in by imperfect human hands. Industry continues her march forward!\n\nThese were a long time coming, however. Increases in budgets and a renewed focus on what our industries are making have increased support for a much-needed renovation of our country's industrial equipment."
 societal_development.1112.a:0 "Now, what to make?"
 
 societal_development.1113.t:0 "Worse Industrial Equipment"
 societal_development.1113.desc:0 "Somewhere, in a cavernous factory, a rolling mill machine's engine cracked under pressure. It was not the fault of a worker or the installer, simply the age of the equipment. Years of neglect and lack of funds from managers had meant that most of the factory was old and decrepit. This was not a huge problem, of course. The worker called his manager, who made a request for a repairman. The serviceman replaced the small engine and within a couple hours of the problem the man was back at work.\n\nOf course, one example of old industry does not cause economic struggles for so many. It is the ignorance of millions of pieces of industrial equipment, over many years, that results in this. All over the country, every day, so many pieces of equipment break down, and are poorly fixed or replaced by older, simpler products. By the end of this all, our country's industrial capabilities will be far worse then when we started."
 societal_development.1113.a:0 "Disgraceful."

 societal_development.1114.t:0 "Better Agricultural Methods"
 societal_development.1114.desc:0 "Without food, men may not work. And without work, government simply ceases to exist, the bureaucracy that sustained it evaporating in a matter of weeks. However, the inverse is also true. With more food comes more plenty and the formation of ever more complex states. After all, were not the first states formed with the creation of agriculture?\n\nNew agricultural innovations will reduce the amount of hard labor needed on the fields and shift the workload to mechanized equipment like tractors and automated harvesters. Advances in fertilizer allows crops to grow quicker and cheaper. Man will have food, and it will be plenty."
 societal_development.1114.a:0 "For this bread, we thank Thee."
 
 societal_development.1115.t:0 "Worse Agricultural Methods"
 societal_development.1115.desc:0 "In the past, it was those who could predict the movement of the moon and the changing of the seasons that held ultimate spiritual authority. Priests held detailed mathematic tables predicting when a river would flood or when it was ripe to harvest. This was the ultimate power, the authority to control (or at least judge) the world around them. The priests of ancient times have been replaced by procedural agricultural almanacs, time-tables and simple calculators. All one needs to do is glance at the calendar on the wall to judge when the wheat is ready for harvest.\n\nAnd yet, that does not mean agricultural methods are foolproof in this new world of printed materials. When farmers don't receive the latest information about harvests, or when they use inefficient land management methods, the harvest is smaller. From these farmers, the entire economy suffers. The most basic commodities go up in price and more go to receive food stamps or simply starve. That is what is happening today - inefficient water use, land management, and use of seeds has led the nation towards a poorer agricultural base, and consequentially a poorer nation."
 societal_development.1115.a:0 "Disgraceful."

 societal_development.1116.t:0 "Better Army Professionalism"
 societal_development.1116.desc:0 ""Yes, sir!"\n\nThose two words seem to be the ultimate lesson in the history of military theory. It is not the quality of guns or weaponry, that make an army, but discipline. Those men that hold until the death because of a command will be the ones to claim victory. In a world of absolute war, of brave new weaponry, it seems we often forget that simple fact. An army cannot function without those two words. Luckily, anti-corruption programs in the army and new boot camps have brought our army one step closer to the ultimate goal of spartanic valor. No longer will our men defect or serve political masters. They will serve the generals, and nothing less."
 societal_development.1116.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 societal_development.1117.t:0 "Worse Army Professionalism"
 societal_development.1117.desc:0 "It seems that every so often, a scandal erupts in the army. Sometimes, it's a battalion drunkely rattling off military secrets after being plied with enough wine. Sometimes, it's a chief general sending his men to some place that happens to benefit a certain wealthy politican or lobbying group. Sometimes, it's a simple matter of mass disobedience.\n\nThe issue with these cases is that they continue to happen with increasing frequency. No longer is this a one-off occasion, but the state that the military has become. It is no doubt due to declining priorities in our armed forces and a lax watch of those who hold the true monopoly of power."
 societal_development.1117.a:0 "Disgraceful."
