fiscal_crisis.0.t:0 "Fiscal Crisis!"
fiscal_crisis.0.desc: "We have mismanaged our finances and our debt-to-GDP has skyrocketed! The government must now significantly cut expenditures or face a major economic crisis.\n\nThe government, led by [THIS.GetLeader], must find a way to balance the budget while also significantly reducing the country's sovereign debt, lest we be forced to default, or worse, face complete insolvency."
fiscal_crisis.0.a: "You don't get a sustained economic recovery while the fiscal system is in crisis."

fiscal_crisis.1.t: "The Long Road To Recovery"
fiscal_crisis.1.desc: "As the banks reopen their doors, shops unshutter their windows, and as belts are loosened, our nation breathes a sigh of relief. Our economy has weathered the worst of the storm and clear skies appear on the horizon. However, not all is well. Homes have been foreclosed, businesses folded, and lives ruined by poverty. For some, the recovery has come far too late. "
fiscal_crisis.1.a: "The future is brighter, if only a little bit."

fiscal_crisis.2.t: "Breathing Room"
fiscal_crisis.2.desc: "The wound left by our economic downturn has begun to scar. Though it still throbs and pulsates with pain from time to time, it is healing. Government support and individual ingenuity have led to our fiscal recovery, and we can only be thankful for how far we have come. Across the country, people tentatively have begun to invest, to take out loans, to make some risks with their money, the fear of sudden descent into poverty averted. Though things are improving, we must stay vigilant, lest we slip into such a crisis again."
fiscal_crisis.2.a: "A little hope goes a long way."

fiscal_crisis.11.t: "Credit Out of Default"
fiscal_crisis.11.desc: "A year after our government could no longer pay its debt and declared bankruptcy, we have, thankfully, escaped from our fiscal sinkhole.

Our economists, however, urge us to be more careful in the future, lest we find ourselves back in such dire circumstances."
fiscal_crisis.11.a: "Steady as she goes."

fiscal_crisis.12.t: "Bankruptcy"
fiscal_crisis.12.desc: "Due to terrible mismanagement and misfortune, we are no longer able to pay our creditors. As a result, we have declared bankruptcy, which will have devastating effects on our economy and citizenry. Our reputation amongst our creditors will be damaged, the banks will be forced to issue write offs, and internal demand will plummet. We can only hope that things will improve, but we face a bleak immediate future."
fiscal_crisis.12.a: "How did we let this happen?"
TNO_bankruptcy: "§RThis will not be good for the economy§!"

fiscal_crisis.20.t: "Deeper Into The Red"
fiscal_crisis.20.desc: "Despite our best efforts, the fiscal crisis continues to worsen. Homes have foreclosed, businesses have evaporated, and jobs have been lost. If we continue on this path, we stand to lose even more than we already have. As economists and politicians scramble, the people watch their savings go up in smoke. As money makes a hasty exit, so too does trust in the government."
fiscal_crisis.20.a: ""Fix this, and fast!""
