 POLITICS_PETROS_POGHOSYAN_DESC:0 "No beast in human skin, no desolate Russian prison, no amount of guns, men and bullets could keep Petros Poghosyan from his beloved Armenia.\n\nWhen the Ottomans forced his countrymen to perish in the cruel desert heat, he struck back alongside his fellow patriots like an avenging angel of death, watering the earth with the blood of Djemal Pasha for his crimes. When the Soviets invaded Armenia, Petros was taken by those cruel Russian commissars and forced into the bitter arctic gulags in Vorkuta. Even the frozen chain fences of the Soviet Union could not hold him, and when the prisoners of Vorkuta took flight, Petros was free once more to return to beloved Armenia, a nation still in chains.\n\nThe avenging angel has wasted no time in taking up arms once more, linking back up with his fellow conspirators of ages past, like Marius Yuzbashyan, to plan the restoration of the Armenian nation and people. The coming war will be long and hard-fought, this Petros knows, and such petty concerns as ideology and faith matters little when the gun is to the head of an entire nation.\n\nWoe be to the Turkish oppressor, for forty years were not enough to rid them of Poghosyan, and now it is certain. §RNothing will ever be.§!"
 POLITICS_MARIUS_YUZBASHYAN_DESC:0 "Marius Aramovich- titled Yuzbashyan- has spent his life in service of Armenia, whether or not that nation has had a state to call her own. As the former Head of State Security for the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Marius already had an extensive web of connections- both professional and off-the-book- that he was able to utilize after the Turks stormed into the collapsing Union and put the Armenian people in chains. The process of building up an active and effective resistance is slow, steady work, fraught with peril, but Marius has not blinked or faltered in his duty.\n\nTo accomplish his goals, Marius needs allies, and he has found one of the most loyal and capable a man can, Petros Poghosyan, one of the masterminds of Operation Nemesis all of those years ago. His own Marxist-Leninist ideals may not line up perfectly with Poghosyan's more single-minded nationalism, but both men know that ideology cannot stand in the way of the restoration of a free and independent Armenia.\n\nThe traps have been set, his agents are in place. All throughout Armenia men and women- patriots all- await the call of Marius and Petros. They await the call to action, to the final battle, in which Armenia will stand on her own two feet, or she will die on her own two feet!"
 
 ARM_Fedayeen_Gather:0 "페다이, 집합!"
 ARM_Fedayeen_Gather_desc:0 "For too long have the people of Armenia suffered under the oppression of the Turk. We have been beaten down, chained, tortured, and killed by our oppressor, all in the name of some grand vision by a man long dead. Now, our people will gather, and we will take our revenge.\n\nOur brave fedayi gather, and make ready for war. It will be a glorious struggle, worthy of song and verse! As long as the people support us, we will never give up, never surrender, §Vnot until the very last drop of Armenian blood has been shed in the name of our homeland.§!"
 ARM_united_front:0 "아라스 통일전선"
 ARM_united_front_desc:0 "The Armenian people are not the only ones to have felt the displeasure of the Turk. Many of our Caucasian brothers and sisters have felt the lash as we have, and feel the same anger that we do towards our hated enemy. The Azeri in particular have joined with us in great numbers, and make their way to the front lines alongside us. Arm in arm, the many peoples of Caucasia will join together to finally make our shared dream a reality. We will be free."
 ARM_Operation_Nemesis:0 "작전명: 네메시스"
 ARM_Operation_Nemesis_desc:0 "The Armenian government has come together for one thing, and one thing only: the complete and total liberation of the Armenian people from Turkey. Nothing else matters in the pursuit of this goal. They care not for good governance, for pittances like domestic policy or foreign relations. There is not time for such things. All must be swept aside in the name of freedom; they care not for what comes after. So long as they take their revenge, and the blood of their families never runs dry, all means will be justified in the end."
