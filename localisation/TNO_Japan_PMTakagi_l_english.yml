 JAP_takagi_prime_minister_takagi:0 "타카기 총리"
 JAP_takagi_prime_minister_takagi_desc:0 "마침내, 익찬회의 자유화를 위한 우리 개혁주의자들이 결실을 맺었습니다. 타카기 소키치는 정부를 구성할 수 있는 충분한 국회 내 지지를 확보했고, 이제 그의 임무가 일본과 공영권이 볼 수 있도록 제시될 것입니다. 제독의 약속에 따라 심각한 부패, 정부의 권력남용, 과도한 군국주의의 시대는 지나갈 것입니다.\n\n그러나 모든 개혁에 신중을 가해야 합니다. 즉, 일본 국가 장치는 다루기 힘든 짐승이고 만약 걸려 넘어지면 심하게 넘어질 것입니다. 그러나 만약 제독이 올바른 방법을 구사하고 언제 어디서 전투를 벌여야 할지 안다면, 우리는 과거의 지나침을 없애는 일본 사회의 장기적인 개혁의 시작을 볼 수 있을 것입니다."
 JAP_new_beginning:0 "익찬회의 새로운 시작"
 JAP_new_beginning_desc:0 "대정익찬회는 엄청나게 거대하고, 느릿느릿하며, 융통성이 없는 정치 조직의 짐승이며, 보수파에서 혁신관료에 이르기까지 무수한 파벌로 얽혀 있으며 항상 무소속 파벌이 반대하고 있습니다. 불행하게도, 이 단체는 일본 내에서 유일한 합법적인 정당이며, 국회의원의 대다수는 합법적인 당원들입니다. 제독의 정권이 들어서기 위해서는 익찬회의 약점을 이용해야 하고 자신들의 이익을 위해 약점을 이용해야 할 것입니다. 아마도 더 빡빡한 배를 운행하는 것이 귀족원의 자신감을 높여줄 것이고, 결국 우리에게 큰 도움이 될 것입니다."
 JAP_problem_sectarianism:0 "파벌주의의 문제점"
 JAP_problem_sectarianism_desc:0 "익찬회는 단순한 통제불능의 짐승이 아니라 서로 반대되는 자유파, 보수파, 혁신관료, 무소속과 같이 4개의 파벌로 구성된 히드라입니다. 무엇보다도 군부의 지휘관이 우리 머리 위에 남아 있습니다.\n\n그러나 우리는 누구에게 호소할 것인지, 그리고 국회에서 어떤 역할을 하는지 선택함으로써 이러한 내분을 이용할 수 있습니다. 바라건대, 올바른 방법으로 올바른 접근에 집중함으로써 우리는 국회 내의 파벌주의를 반대파들과 맞서게 하고, 우리의 이익을 위해 바꿀 수 있기를 바랍니다.\n\n그렇다면 우리가 누구와 연합을 맺어야 하고, 누구를 개들에게 맡길 지 결정하는 것이 가장 중요할 것입니다. 그것을 대충 설명하자면, 우리가 가진 모든 차이점들에도 불구하고 이케다의 보수파는 우리에게 기울어질 가능성이 높습니다. 왜냐하면 보수파와 자유파는 예측불허의 급진적인 키도파와 혁신관료들에 비하면 온건하기 때문입니다."

 JAP_cooperation_and_compromise_desc:0 "우리는 국회 내의 다른 파벌들에 대해 더 가벼운 손을 내미는 동시에 국회 밖에서 우리 파벌의 지지자들의 이상주의를 활용 할 수 있습니다. 이를 위해 우리는 다른 의원들의 호의를 바탕으로 협력과 타협의 렌즈를 통해 우리의 개혁주의를 촉진시킬 것입니다. 그러나 일부 개혁에 영향을 줄 것입니다. 우리가 이 길을 가려면 다른 파벌들의 조율에 더 가깝게 따라가야 할 것입니다."

 JAP_reconciling_and_reformism_desc:0 "우리 파벌과 혁신관료들은 일본이 개혁과 조정이 필요하고 그렇게 하지 않다면 일본이 사라진다고 보는 요소들은 겹치는 관점입니다. 그러나, 우리가 행동하고자 하는 방법과 지향하는 목표에 있어서 혁신관료들과 크게 다릅니다.\n\n국가장치의 합리화 같은 혁신관료들과 특정한 문제들을 타협함으로써, 우리는 대부분의 온건 혁신관료들과 심지어 몇몇 기시의 하인들로부터 지지를 끌어낼 수 있을 것입니다. 즉 다시말해 급진적인 구조조정은 위험하여 귀족원의 지지도와 군부의 분노와 같은 대가를 치르게 될 것입니다."

 JAP_unified_resistance_desc:0 "우리는 이노와 이케다의 보수파와 군부에 대해 좀 더 독립적인 마인드의 혁신관료들의 반대에 부응할 수 있을 것입니다. 수단과 목적이 아무리 이질적이더라도, 우린 국회 냉에서 단결된 전선을 촉진함으로써 두 쪽 전부 이득을 볼 수 있습니다. 이것은 물론 국회 내의 정치계를 크게 뒤흔들 것입니다. 그렇게 크고 빈약한 전선은 분명히 정책에 대한 이견과 충돌을 야기할 것입니다. 그러나 지금 당장은 보수주의자들을 몰아낸 다음, 나중에 우리끼리 이견을 정리하는 것이 좋을 것입니다."
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy:0 "계속되는 유산"
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy_desc:0 "개혁과 자유화를 위한 제독의 거대한 계획은 사실 새로운 계획이 아닙니다. 이것은 메이지 천황과 다이쇼 천황의 현상으로의 회귀라고 주장할 수 있는데, 자유와 억제, 전통적 가치와 진보적 가치 사이의 균형입니다. 따라서 우리는 메이지 시대와 다이쇼 시대의 긍정적인 면들을 활용할 수 있고, 그 시대의 연속으로서 제독의 행정부를 투영할 수 있습니다.\n\n의심할 여지 없이, 그러한 개혁을 추진하는 것은 국회의 강격한 의원들뿐만 아니라 귀족원에도 호소할 것이지만, 가장 중요한 것은 군국주의의 과잉에 잃어버린 시대와 정신을 호소함으로써 우리를 대중과 함께 안전한 지역에 머물게 할 것입니다."
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai:0 "국체론을 어필하다"
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai_desc:0 "메이지와 다이쇼 천황의 영광스러운 시대의 유산을 호소하는 것 외에도, 우리는 정부를 국가 정치와 주권의 본질인 국체론 강화와 우리 사회가 지켜야 할 정당한 수단을 제시할 수 있을 것입니다.\n\n이것은 우리의 개혁적인 노력을 구시대의 회귀로 제시하고, 순수성을 강화하며, 사회 불안을 극복하고, 동시에 군국주의자들과 보수주의자들의 과오를 폄하하는 동시에 일본의 새로운 황금시대를 이끌어냄으로써 달성될 수 있습니다."
 JAP_strength_and_totality:0 "힘과 완전성"
 JAP_strength_and_totality_desc:0 "물론 일본은 개혁을 필요로 하고, 보수파에 의해 정해진 길을 계속 가면 국체론이 훼손되고 일본 국가 주권과 같은 중요한 요소들이 박탈될 것입니다.\n\n그러나 국회에 있는 모든 사람들이나 귀족원이 이것에 만족하지는 않을 것이지만, 거래에 영항을 받지 않으면서 우리가 의도한 개혁의 범위를 더 자유롭게 결정할 수 있을 것입니다."
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned:0 "환멸에 호소하다"
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned_desc:0 "연정을 세우는 작업을 시작하기 위해, 국회의 가장자리에 있는 자들과 찌꺼기같은 자들을 아웃시킬 수 있습니다. 특히, 기시와 카야의 노선에 환멸을 느끼거나 동의하지 않는 혁신관료들을 흡수하는 작업을 마련할 수 있을 것입니다. 게다가, 이노의 거대한 보수연합체는 적어도 몇몇 반대파가 섞여있을 가능성이 높은, 복잡한 조직입니다. 마지막으로, 우리는 더욱 독자적인 생각을 가진 의원들, 특히 파벌주의에 싫증이 나고 진절머리가 난 의원들을 끌어들일 수 있습니다. 하나하나씩, 우리는 개혁 법안을 안정적으로 통과시키기 위해 필요한 과반수를 획득하기 위해 노력할 것입니다."
 JAP_solidify_base:0 "기반 강화"
 JAP_solidify_base_desc:0 "환멸을 느끼고 쉽게 설득될 수 있었던 의원들이 우리 산하에 있는 가운데, 이제 우리는 자유파 진영을 국회 내부에서 공고히 하는데 집중할 수 있을 것입니다. 몇번의 저녁 파티가, 낚시 여행과 요트 여행도 이뤄졌습니다. 우리의 개혁적인 관점이 탄력을 받고, 투표되고, 그리고 수월하게 과반수 득표와 큰 차이로 비준되는 길으로 아마 제대로 가고 있을 것입니다.\n\n물론 우리 파벌이 강해질수록, 혁신관료, 보수파, 그리고 군이 우리의 반대파를 지원할 가능성이 기하급수적으로 커질 것입니다. 하지만 방향을 명백히 한 것이 우리가 할 수 있었던 최선의 선택이었는지는 오직 시간만이 알 수 있을 것입니다."
 JAP_end_siege_mentality:0 "포위 의식의 끝"
 JAP_end_siege_mentality_desc:0 "우리나라의 부와 번영은 사실 전쟁을 통해 형성되었으며, 지난 20년 동안 군국주의, 적개심, 그리고 제노포비아 문화가 위에서 아래로 스며들었습니다. 조선인 노동자들에 반발해 일어나는 우리 도시들 내에서의 폭동부터 여전히 근질근질해하는 대본영의 방아쇠의 손가락까지, 끊임없이 자신을 드러내고 있습니다. 이는 전시 국가의 구조에 적합할지도 모르지만, 우리는 더 이상 그런 상황에 있지 않습니다.\n\n이 상황을 끝내기 위해, 우리의 평화, 번영, 개방의 증진이라는 우리의 강령을 일본 뿐만 아니라, 전 세계로 확대할 것입니다. 이는 일부 파벌들에게 분명 인기가 없을 것이지만, 이는 개방적이고 투명한 정부의 새로운 시대를 열 것입니다."
 JAP_appropriating_reformism:0 "적절한 개혁주의"
 JAP_appropriating_reformism_desc:0 "혁신관료는 의회에서 엄청나게 강력한 파벌이며, 우리만큼 이노와 이케다의 보수파들을 강력히 반대합니다. 문제는 그들이 국가기구가 어떻게 정의되고, 개혁되며, 재구성되어야 하는지에 대해서 우리와는 매우 다른 입장이라는 것입니다.\n\n우리가 국방국가라는 그들의 주장에 동의하지는 않지만, 그들의 덜 급진적인 국유화 계획들 중의 일부를 가져와 선수쳐버릴 수 있을 것입니다. 가장 중요한 것은 여기에 핵심 부문의 국유화와 자이바츠 영향력의 축소하는 안이 포함되어 있다는 겁니다."
 JAP_beginning_second_phase:0 "두번째 단계의 시작"
 JAP_beginning_second_phase_desc:0 "이제 자유파의 사람들과 내부조직이 굳건해지면서 제독은 우리의 세력 통합의 두번째 단계로 나아갈 수 있게 되었습니다. 즉, 그저 이케다와 키도의 찌꺼기들만 골라내는 게 아니라, 그들의 지지기반들을 어떻게 적절히 다루어야 하는가 마이죠. 우리는 키도와 이케다의 타협을 형식상 묵인하거나, 그 대신 우리 세력이 주도권을 잡는데 유리하도록 그들의 다리를 묶어버릴 수도 있습니다."
 JAP_coalition_equals:0 "평등의 연합"
 JAP_coalition_equals_desc:0 "이케다, 키도와 제대로 된 연정에 들어가는 것이 군국주의자와 강경파에 대항하는 광범위한 연합전선인 의회에서 살아남기 위한 가장 안전한 길이 될 것입니다. 이것은 우리의 장기적인 생존을 위해 더 나은 선택일 수 있으나, 거의 확실히도 우리의 개혁적인 정책에서 한발 물러서야 한다는 것을 의미합니다.\n\n적어도 이로서 될 수 있는 것은 이케다의 거대한 파벌이 우리 법안의 통과를 위해 충분한 과반수를 확실히 보장해줄 수 있다는 것입니다. 하지만, 우리는 세력이 너무 작은 댓가로 매우 많은 것을 내주어야 할지도 모릅니다."
 JAP_settling_differences:0 "차이점 극복"
 JAP_settling_differences_desc:0 "우리의 자유파, 보수파, 그리고 키도 충성파 간의 차이점은 경제로부터 군국주의, 그리고 심지어 우리가 공영권의 거대한 번영과 부를 어떻게 통제하여야 하는가에 이르기까지 매우 큽니다. 그러나 우리 파벌이 개혁을 추진하고 군국주의자들의 영향력을 종식시키기 위해서는 보다 급진적인 개혁을 포기하는 댓가를 치르더라도 군과 이노 내각의 폭주에 대한 공동 반대 입장으로 뭉쳐야 합니다. 이를 염두에 둔다면, 마침내 우리는 우리의 자유주의자들 뿐만 아니라, 저 보수주의자들과 충성파들을 포함하는 방향으로 우리의 거대한 연정을 확장하기 시작할 수 있습니다."
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue:0 "파벌간 음모의 종식"
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue_desc:0 "밀실 거래, 개인적인 부탁, 내부 정치, 협박, 뇌물수수. 이것들은 모두 이노 내각 기간 동안 행해졌던 것들이었습니다. 이는 투명성의 부족, 부패, 그리고 행정의 혼돈을 불러오기 때문에, 제독이 혐오하는 방식입니다.\n\n이 상태를 끝내기 위해, 제독과 그의 최측근 보좌관들은 가장 악랄한 범죄자들을 시작으로 더러운 정치와 부패의 역사를 가진 우리의 의원들의 과거를 뒤질 것입니다. 곧 국회 내 다수파가 될 우리에게 맞서는 사람들에게는 그들의 정치생명을 확실히 끝내줄 것이기에, 그들은 이에 따를 수 밖에 없을 것입니다."
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda:0 "이케다와의 협력"
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda_desc:0 "이케다 마사노스케는 확고한 사람입니다. 엄격한 보수주의자이고, 성질이 급하며, 무엇보다도 가장 중요한 것은 국회 내에서 가장 강력한 파벌을 이끌고 있는 사람이라는 것입니다. 우리 자유주의자들과 그들 보수주의자들은 모든 정책과 관련해서 잘 맞지는 않을지도 모르지만, 지금까지 우리는 혁신관료와 군국주의자들을 약화시키려는 목적 하에 뭉쳤습니다.\n\n우리는 군국주의의 축소와 관련된 중요한 법안을 통과시키기 위해 국회에서 그의 협조를 계속 추구할 것입니다. 이를 확실히 하여 상대적으로 우리가 더욱 나아갈 수 있게 할 것입니다. 더욱 중대한 사안들로 말이죠..."
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido:0 "키도의 평판 회복"
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido_desc:0 "키도 코이치는 복합적인 유산을 남긴 사람입니다. 한쪽 면으로는, 우리나라의 통제가 완화된 이유는 전쟁 이후 군에 대한 그의 계획적인 탈정치화가 신호탄이 되었습니다. 반면, 그는 군국주의자들과 개혁 관료들의 강한 불만으로, 암울하게 퇴임했습니다. 이제 그는 국회 내의 우리 파벌들과 협력을 구했는데, 그의 제안을 받아들이지 않는 것은 말도 안되는 일이며, 그의 황실 및  귀족원과의 연게가 지지를 강화하는 데 결정적인 역할을 할 것입니다.\n\n그 대신, 제독에게는 키도의 이미지를 회복시켜주는 것이 현명할 것입니다. 이는 국회 연설, 익찬회 관보, 그리고 신문 인터뷰에서 그의 노력을 인정하는 것으로서 달성될 수 있습니다. 바라건대, 그 노인이 일본 사람들에 의해 그의 구원을 볼 수 있도록 살기를 바랍니다."

 JAP_accessing_our_coalition_desc:0 "이케다 마사노스케와 그의 패거리들과 연합하는 것에 대해 의구심을 품은 사람들이 많았습니다. 보수와의 결별이라는 우리들의 근본을 감안할 때 이는 이해할 수 있는 일이지만, 이제는 연정이 현명한 조치라고 볼 수 있을 것입니다. 타카기 총리의 유능한 리더십을 통해 연정은 예상을 훨씬 뛰어넘었습니다. 우리는 주로 보수파를 견제해왔으며, 그들의 다양한 경제 및 사회 기관과의 연계는 그들을 우리의 통치를 발전시키는 데 특히 유용했습니다. 연정은 제국의회에서 예의범절을 지키는 것 뿐만 아니라 시민들의 행복을 유지하는 데에도 도움을 주었습니다. 하지만 지금은 초창기이며, 이케다와의 협력이 일본을 얼마나 번영하게 만들 수 있을지는 두고 보아야 할 것입니다. 언제나 해야 할 일이 더 많이 남아있습니다."

 JAP_piecemeal_compromises_desc:0 "혁신관료들은 집단으로서 자유주의적인 움직임에 완강한 반대를 표방하고 있습니다. 아이러니하게도, 이들의 몇몇 개별적인 구성원들은 우리 파벌과 타협하기 가장 쉬운것으로 드러났습니다. 하지만, 우리 파벌의 영향력을 고려했을 때, 우리는 주요 정책에서 너무 많은 타협을 할 필요가 없습니다.\n\n중요하지 않은 분야의 온건한 국유화나 해외의 소규모 자이바츠 소유주에 대한 강제적인 구조조정 등 공통점을 찾을 수 있는 몇몇 지점이 있다는 이점을 누릴 수 있습니다. 이 모든 것들이 아마 국가에 유리하게 기업 권력을 축소시킬 수 있을 것입니다. 결국, 이는 혁신관료들 중 일부를 지지하게 하고, 그들이 우리에게 명백히 반대하지 못하도록 하는 역할을 할 것입니다."

In the wider Sphere, the army is cut loose to do as they please, much to the chagrin of anyone not in their good graces. Prime Minister Takagi's efforts to eliminate corruption have so far been mostly limited to the Home Islands. It would be wise to examine the situation in the colonies as well, as the army is surely commiting worse crimes outside of Japan.

In the past, we have also viewed these garrisons as an important part of keeping our presence felt in the colonies. The army, too, had reasons for maintaining the garrisons for so long. A great deal of territory and resources had been handed over to them by Prime Minister Ino, which they now cling to dearly.\n\nAlthough we would be fools to entirely trust the colonial administrations to handle themselves, many of the army garrisons do little more than sit in their barracks these days. Their presence is costly and inefficient, so the Prime Minister will be recalling them to Japan. Any opportunity to weaken the army and balance the budget is well worth committing to."

The Prime Minister is still committed to the demilitarization of the Sphere and must therefore work around or with our armed forces to achieve this goal. By utilizing the Prime Minister's connection in the Navy, we can begin to establish firmer relationships with both branches of the military. This will allow us to properly negotiate, rather than cause a diplomatic meltdown each time we attempt to curtail excess military power. Our allies within the armed forces will ensure that the branches act in a suitable manner. The military will turn its attention to defending our shores from threats from within and without. After all, what use is there in a complacent military?\n\nOnce we have the IJA and IJN off our backs, we will be able to fully focus on the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

In the army headquarters and in their garrisons across the Sphere, traces of corruption and deep misconduct linger on.

Ino, already heavily embroiled in corruption, only allowed the issues within the party to grow worse. This is the disaster that we have inherited.\n\nThe Imperial Diet is our primary target in removing Ino's legacy. Both Houses will be targeted, and we will pay particular attention to the conservatives.

As we have a vested interest in investigating that army group, it would be wise to infiltrate and observe their domain in the Liaodong peninsula. Fortunately for us, the civilian administration of Kwantung, the Kanto-Cho, indirectly reports to us through the Ministry of Greater East Asia.\n\nThe Prime Minister has issued a quiet directive to loyalists in Dairen to closely observe any suspicious activities of the IJA.

He is far too likely to try to cover up the army's crimes.\n\nInstead of going to him, we will seek out our contacts in Hsinking and have them begin something of an unofficial investigation into army activity in Manchukuo.

Its imposing presence aside, it would be simple enough for a few of our agents, disguised as Kwantung soldiers, to march in, wiretap a few key locations, and then slip out before anyone notices.\n\nOnce the HQ is cracked open for us, we will be able to listen in on whatever matters the Kwantung commanders had hoped to keep private.

Both partners in the alliance grew immensely wealthy as a result of their addicted "customers". However, their partnership strained when the army began to favour the Reform Bureaucrats. While we care little for the morality of these past actions, the slow disintegration of relations between the IJA and Mitsui has the potential to be useful.\n\nThe Prime Minister intends to approach Mitsui with the offer of letting them keep their side of the profits in return for information about the army.

Allowing the army to regain their hold on the Diet would be truly disastrous. Fortunately for us, the IJA's corruption has spilled over onto the Reform Bureaucrats.\n\nTheir extensive association with duplicitous members of the army is more than enough evidence for us to attack.

Yet even in their weakened state, the army and parts of the Imperial Diet still respect the words and leadership of these aged figures. Their influence is enough to warrant removal in the Prime Minister's eyes.\n\nThe Toseiha generals' connections to various corrupt officials and businessmen provides us with more than enough justification for removing them.

After all, there have been plenty of corruption accusations levied against peers in the past.\n\nPrime Minister Takagi is determined to make sure that none of these allegations are a risk to his government. To surrender the House of Peers to bribery and deceit would be a defeat not worth suffering under any circumstances.

The sight of these buildings left empty is not something that anyone wants repeated. Therefore, the Prime Minister has hired a great number of officials to observe warehouses across Japan.

In its place, Nakasone aims to implement a system similar to that in the US and the rest of the Western world.

As a result, the government is directing funding to areas that do not contribute to the well-being of the people. These extraneous expenses have bled the nation's funds dry, leaving no money for projects that are actually useful or beneficial.\n\nNakasone's solution is simple: sell off these money-sinks to corporations that would make better use of them.

Japan cannot survive the ever-growing economic connectedness of the modern world if it is to use old systems built on domination and conquest.\n\nTogether, Takagi and Nakasone have agreed to further their collective vision of a free market and cut-down government.

It is a cycle of growth, one which Nakasone believes can be accelerated through the aforementioned cutting of taxes and regulations.\n\nTakagi, like in all things, is cautious towards what he considers Nakasone's unbridled idealism with regards to the free market and the corporations within.

The freer the individual is, the better Japan will be.\n\nYet none in the Diet, not even among the liberals, believe that liberalization will be an easy or straightforward task. The activists, the students, and the media provide the Japanese social landscape with an inherent unpredictability.

For good reason: the liberals and the student movement share many frustrations with the system, however, the reforms must stick - and that is what the government is preparing to do.\n\nThe Admiral instead chooses to interpret the term "winter" differently.

A firebrand and an activist, an agitator to the agitated, she could prove to be crucial in summoning the political will needed to enact Admiral Takagi's reforms.\n\nAnd so, the Prime Minister accepts her into his inner circle.

Matters such as pay, social roles, and the recurrent notion that a wife should submit to a husband have damaged the standing of women ever since the Meiji Restoration. Or perhaps a long time before.\n\nMobilizing the female sex into political consciousness shall be Shidzue Kato's policy as a key member of the liberal clique.

The Prime Minister shall seek to reason with them, for there exists a thing to Japanese life, far beneath its economic underpinnnings: the heart and soul of its people.

While the youths generally support the end of sterilisation for patients of leprosy and for inheritable conditions deemed undesirable by the public, Kato herself has been rather tight-lipped over the issue.

Many of them are still looking for a chance at appearing active in Diet affairs. There is no harm in humouring their wishes.\n\nOur collaboration with the conservatives will take one of two forms.

After all, no reform bureaucrat is opposed to the creation of new protections, which cannot be said of the conservatives. We would also be increasing our own control of the economy, and hopefully appeasing the protesters. Yet it would be naive to consider this an alliance without potential repercussions.\n\nThere are quite a few Liberals who would raise hell should we align with the Reform Bureaucrats, several of which have cabinet positions.

Therefore, we shall allow the reform bureaucrats to operate as they see fit, within reason. It is even possible that the Prime Minister takes onboard some of their suggestions.

In contrast to a similar proposal by the conservatives, this "technocratic protections bureau" would be granted much more direct authority. While this would certainly ensure the Zaibatsu and Keiretsu behave themselves, the bureau itself might have some issues.\n\nThe Reform Bureaucrats have been very clear that they would be heavily involved with its creation and staffing.

With this in mind, the Prime Minister has made it clear that the corporations are not to have a say in the coming changes. Using the information we gathered with our corruption investigations as well as a few pieces of information gathered by the reform bureaucrats, we should be able to silence the corporations for the near future. It is doubtful that they wish to make their difficult situation any worse.\n\nIt is undeniable that this harsh tactic has gone against some of the principles of the liberal clique, but Prime Minister Takagi releases that this is the right path forward.

Once this is done, it is far more likely that our allies will actively work towards the implementation of the reforms.\n\nThe second part of our plan is just as critical as the fist. We must now choose how we are going to counteract or subdue the influence of the corporations. While some of them are open to negotiation, the others will require the use of more indirect tactics.

Getting the finance minister has been something of a hassle, but it should be of immense value to our cause. Nakasone, due to his great popularity within corporate circles, is the man with the most sway with the keiretsu in the government. He would be more than capable of cutting a few deals with the right people, in order to get some of the corporations off our backs. Given enough time and some of them might even see the light of supporting the new laws. Surely it is good for business to appear consumer-friendly?

However, the sheer scale of such an operation is nearly impossible for the employees of the ministry of finance to handle at the moment. During this critical phase on the road to enforce protective legislation, it is vital that our bureaucracy can function at utmost effectiveness. The Prime Minister has therefore given the green light to expanding the responsible departments to a suitable size.

Not everyone sees the light of this approach unfortunately. The presence of hardliners in the Diet has hindered the Prime Minister's mission to gather enough votes. Regardless of if they are proponents of deregulation or nationalization, these voices are little more than sources of provocation.\n\nSome of the hardliners can fortunately be swayed by promises of compensation or ressaunces of further reforms.

Their rights as consumers are now better defined, and more government oversight is to begin in corporate circles. The latter point takes the form of a "Protections Bureau", which would act as a government watchdog, with the power to quickly act upon corporate malpractice and abuse. Although Prime Minister Takagi had originally hoped for a more radical act, it would appear that his concerns have now been mitigated.

The core ideals are largely based on those proposed by the Prime Minister, that of a government that is empowered to deal with the misdeeds of Keiretsu and Zaibatsu alike. However, the involvement of the Reform Bureaucrats has taken these initial ideas further.\n\nShould this act become law then we, and our allies will have the power to greatly curtail the powers of the corporations.

Needless to say, the Prime Minister is very displeased, and our cabinet is at a loss as they attempt to mop up the clutter of our recent failures."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Paving_The_Way:0 "앞길을 닦다"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Paving_The_Way_desc:0 "Our attempts to reform and strengthen the empire have largely been a success. Our cabinet seems quite pleased with the results of their findings, and the Diet has approved of most of our moves in regards to our Asian holdings. However, our mission is not yet complete; we have achieved much in the name of organisation and planning, and now comes the time to execute what we have spent many tireless days and nights preparing for. We have coordinated with offices and administrations from across the Pacific, and at the behest of the Prime Minister, the next stage of our plans will be set in motion, The Empire shall stand stronger than ever."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Begin_The_Dismantlement:0 "해체 시작"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Begin_The_Dismantlement_desc:0 "The time has come to withdraw from North Borneo and do away with the millions of yen wasted each year spent supporting a costly military administration over Sarawak. Our ships will arrive soon to relieve General Baba and his men from their posts and return them home, where they will be welcomed as war heroes and patriots. Upon arrival, medals will be awarded, military songs chanted, beautiful girls kissed... and the administration will be dismantled entirely. With the money now safely conserved in our coffers, our government can direct more funding, investment, energy, and attention towards properly developing our mighty empire."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_To_The_Victor:0 "To The Victor Go The Spoils"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_To_The_Victor_desc:0 "With the military administration in Northern Borneo lifted, Malayan, Indonesian, and Filipino emissaries have been invited to discuss the finalization of our plans to divide the land amongst our allies. Accompanied by anthropologists and geological professionals, we welcome the emissaries and settle them into talks over the future of Southeast Asia, in particular, who will get what in the division of the dissolved colony.\n\nWhile disagreement and squabbles might arise over miniscule land disputes between the representatives, the Prime Minister remains charismatic enough to bargain with all three parties and intimidating enough to force them into agreement."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Suppress_Environmentalists:0 "환경운동 탄압"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Suppress_Environmentalists_desc:0 "A movement across Japan has recently surfaced, critical of the increasing industrialization, carbon emissions, and resource extraction across the Sphere. Concerned with the preservation of the natural environment 'now threatened by rising pollution levels', young people fill the streets and universities to spread these lies, poisoning the growing strength of our Empire. Understanding this vocal opposition is key to defeating it. We will begin using interrogation and infiltration as our key tools in stomping out the environmental movement before it can truly undermine our administration's efforts to strengthen the development of Japan."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_New_Britain_New_Dig:0 "New Britain's New Dig"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_New_Britain_New_Dig_desc:0 "With our economic interests firmly anchored in the Melanesian islands, our great resource projects are due to be finalized and then opened to private investment. We expect to rake in enormous streams of revenue and develop the region beyond our original ambition for the isles.\n\nDespite the heaps of cash already flowing into the tropical island, we have yet to announce the opening of an offshore oilfield to drilling contractors eager to make billions from crude oil. The immense wealth-creation in this business is due to bring great riches to the empire and circulate throughout the Sphere, clear proof of Japan's economic might over the Pacific and East Asia."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Colonial_Investments:0 "식민지 투자"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Colonial_Investments_desc:0 "The Empire of Japan, mightier and more powerful than ever, stands tall over colonial possessions across the Pacific. From Tokyo, Osaka, and every other major city, investments flow to develop our holdings' infrastructure and economies.\n\nToday, bridges are built, tall buildings are erected, and roads are paved in the name of our achievements in reforming the empire. Jobs are abundant in the Melansian regions, and quality of life is rising. The Prime Minister is applauded for his outstanding successes in developing even the most uncultivated and barren corners of our empire."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Japanisation_Continues:0 "계속되는 일본화"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Japanisation_Continues_desc:0 "Our process of assimilation and civilization in our colonies has proved extremely successful in Choson and Taiwan, and our government is determined to continue the initiative in our Pacific territories. Just as we have industrialized and urbanized Choson and abolished backwards traditions in Taiwan, we will seek to enlighten the peoples of Melanesia by assimilating them into the Japanese way of life.\n\nMore and more Japanese migrate to these colonies, bringing with them our traditions and values; we aim to successfully integrate these native peoples into our customs and raise them from their own indecencies. Indeed, the Empire of Japan leads with an altruistic guidance, determined to lift her subjects from darkness."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Nihonjinron_Doctrine:0 "The Nihonjinron Doctrine"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Nihonjinron_Doctrine_desc:0 "Our government, faced with the challenges of a modern Japan, has developed a vast and sophisticated program of activity across the Co-Prosperity Sphere to build up influence throughout Asia. Broadly, the strategy has two prongs: first, to develop the technological and strategic expertise needed for Japan to maintain its position as a first-rank industrial and military power; second, to assert Japanese economic and cultural leadership around the world, cementing its position as a serious rival to the German and American regimes. Takagi names this the 'Nihonjinron Doctrine' as an expression of Japan's unique cultural and political position in the world, championing this key strategy as the path to international primacy and prestige." 
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Japanese_Duty:0 "일본의 의무"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Japanese_Duty_desc:0 "As the shining light of liberation across Asia and the leading beacon of resistance against western aggression, it is the duty of our mighty and just empire to lift our Asian brothers out of poverty and squalor. Just as our great nation modernised in all fields in the Meiji era, we must bring a similar enlightenment to our brother nations across the Sphere so they may also touch greatness. It is the fate of the Empire of Japan to be at the helm of this modern Asian renaissance and to bear witness to the ascension of East Asia to international acclaim."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Education_In_The_Sphere:0 "공영권 내 교육"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Education_In_The_Sphere_desc:0 "For the Co-Prosperity Sphere to remain a powerful competitor against her rivals across the globe, the nations under Japan's benevolent watch must be elevated to form a cohesive and fraternal community of peoples. Therefore, we have determined that educational standards across Asia must be improved and that we shall focus on the enlightenment of future generations from Nanjing to Rangoon. With new educational boards, improved teaching methods, and a drive for higher levels of funding for education across the Sphere, we expect to initiate an entire generation of skilled professionals with a schooling that will raise our communities to new heights."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Pan_Asianist_Propganda:0 "범아시아 선전"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Pan_Asianist_Propganda_desc:0 "The fraternity of nations across Asia has been at the center of our attention since the early Showa era. Millions of men took up arms and gave their lives for the liberation of Asia, and today we live in an age of prosperity which our dead have built for us. With a new generation born after the Greater East Asia War and living free from foreign occupation, it is paramount we do not forget the honor of Pan-Asian brotherhood. Thus, from this day forth, we will remind our children that the peace in Asia was secured under immense pressure and agonizing hardship, and that passionate fraternity between brother nations has brought us liberation from foreign domination."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Investments_In_Azad_Hind:0 "자유 인도 투자"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Investments_In_Azad_Hind_desc:0 "The Azad Hind, our ally in the Indian subcontinent, stands a testament to the virtues of Pan-Asian thought. In this spirit of Pan-Asian fraternity, we have decided to show our patronage and solidarity to our brothers in Bengal. By directing foreign investments, development loans, and other forms of economic assistance to the Government of Free India, we hope to encourage a drive to improve living standards and economic performance. By setting up a strong and reliable Indian ally, our government can retain its Pan-Asian appearance as we aid the brother nations across Asia and also bolster the ranks with another client state subordinate to the Emperor's will."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Middle_East_Beckons:0 "중동이 손짓하다"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Middle_East_Beckons_desc:0 "Recent Zaibatsu interest has drawn our government's attention to the Italian corporations in the Persian Gulf, where oil is cheap and luxuries are plenty. In such a small sliver of land with such great, yet untapped potential, economic investment and influence can benefit the Empire of Japan immensely. With Japanese economic ascendency in these markets, the region has the potential to be a key location for our own political interests. Indeed, sinking the teeth of Japanese capital into these markets and anchoring our influence across the Gulf region can extend our influence across the globe, strengthening national competitiveness and building international leverage."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_A_Soft_Victory:0 "A Soft Victory"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_A_Soft_Victory_desc:0 "Our government has pursued many campaigns and drives internationally to exhibit the cultural capital of Japan as benefactors and patrons of our Asian brothers. Our efforts to aid our allies from Calcutta to Harbin have proved fruitful and ultimately successful in showing the world the generous nature of our Empire. Moreover, with our recent interest and investments outside of the Sphere, our geopolitical muscle is beginning to match our economic might as we continue to leverage our strong cultural assets to improve our overall soft power. With the Prime Minister's recent international showcase of all things Japanese, all eyes and hearts are now turned towards the Land of the Rising Sun."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Military_Might:0 "The Military's Might"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Military_Might_desc:0 "The military, a symbol of the Emperor's peace over Asia, is a sacred institution in Japanese society. From the days of Yamagata to the Great East Asia War, the Japanese military has been characterized as strong, authoritative, and most importantly subordinate to the Emperor.\n\nThundering and determined, the dedication of the military to preserving the Empire is unmatched in intensity and vigor. We cannot let this undying passion go to waste, and showcasing the pride and the image of the Imperial Armed Forces can work in our favor. Exercising the might and will of the Empire of Japan may just be the thing we need to impress our allies and intimidate our foes, humbling all those who dare question our primacy."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Parades_In_Tokyo:0 "도쿄의 시가행진"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Parades_In_Tokyo_desc:0 "In order to maintain the prestige of the Imperial Japanese Army, we must remind the citizens of the Empire of the IJA's vital role in protecting Asia. Many of Tokyo's salarymen, housewives, and students have read of military success and listened to military stories without witnessing the nobility of the institution itself. So, to instill greater pride in the Japanese public, thousands of our brave soldiers will march down the streets of Tokyo, accompanied by marching bands, waving banners, and great cheering crowds. With such marvelous energy and zeal, our soldiers are sure to be hailed as mighty and honorable servants of the Emperor, and the public will cry out with enthusiastic support for our armed forces."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Exercise_Arashi:0 "'아라시' 훈련"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Exercise_Arashi_desc:0 "The indivisible fleets of the Imperial Japanese Navy rule over the Pacific, crashing over the foamy waves and choppy eastern waters. At the order of the Prime Minister, we shall deploy these indomitable fleets across oceans to the four corners of the Pacific, stretching our reach from Fiji to the Bering Straits. As we extend our fleet's reach and project our power across half the globe, the world shall sit and watch as we flex our naval muscles. The shock of artillery fire will tumble through the air as fighters soar off of the deck of colossal aircraft carriers, buzzing across the skies of our conquered oceans. We will show our neighbors that Japan commands the seas, and the Emperor's rule over the oceans shall not be questioned."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Airbases_On_Midway:0 "미드웨이의 비행장"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Airbases_On_Midway_desc:0 "Our decision to build airbases on Midway was motivated by aggression from our neighbors across the Pacific. The American, so ignorant and pig-faced, is unable to accept his own negotiated peace. In his own incoherent rattling for war, he calls for an end to the Emperor's peace over these oceans. To defend against this violent irritation, we will construct great airfields and hangars to house entire squadrons of planes to zoom over the vast Pacific skies. With a base in such a central and strategically advantageous position, the Imperial Armed Forces will have the ability to thrash the fool who dares sail into Japanese territory. While we will not shame our people with pointless conflict now, the world shall know that the Empire of Japan will not cower in the face of foreign invasion."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Improve_Strategic_Deterance:0 "Improve Strategic Deterrence"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Improve_Strategic_Deterance_desc:0 "The mightiest arms in our arsenal are reserved for the mightiest of enemies - the American and the German. Once a rival and once an ally, both of these adversaries chant for our demise and the end of the Emperor's Peace. Therefore, we have deemed it necessary that our nuclear capabilities to defend Asia be at their peak. We will order the research, development, and deployment of the most modern nuclear weapons technologies across our Empire. We refuse to be held hostage by our enemies' call to war and claims of armament, and so we must unveil our arsenal so that they, too, will consider threats of retaliation and thermonuclear destruction."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Steel_Sun_Rises:0 "강철의 태양이 떠오른다"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Steel_Sun_Rises_desc:0 "Like a steel blade, the Imperial Armed Forces are unbroken by the enemy, sailing the choppiest of seas and fighting the toughest battles. Even in relative peace, the glory of our service to the Emperor has been enshrined across the Empire. Children wave imperial banners and crowds cheer upon witnessing the honor of our servicemen defending the Empire and Asia from foreign aggression. A rejuvenated sense of pride shimmers throughout the Empire, and the people rejoice to know our country is not just safe, but prepared to fight in the name of the Emperor if he so wishes. Our great navy crashes through the oceans to guard from foreign invasion, while our men stand proud across the Empire to preserve the existing peace. The flag of the Rising Sun waves higher in the air than ever, not only as a symbol of our nation's pride, but as a reminder to the world that Japan is here to stay."

Their loud humming and whirring had relegated them to the building's corner as to not disturb the rest of the floor, whose own work required more quiet conditions. Officially, the computers were there to solve mathematical equations and to complete simple organizational tasks. However, Nishioka Tetsuya, a computing researcher, had for a long while been pushing the boundaries of what the computers were truly capable of.\n\n"Mister Nishioka, I believe you wished to show me something. You mentioned a potential computing innovation?" The head of Toshiba's research department seemed like an intimidating man to Nishioka, who feared he had heard the promise of miraculous innovation followed by little more than poor excuses for failure. Nor did it help that his superior stood a good foot taller than him, which blotted out the light from the lamp behind him. "Yes, well I have been conducting some independent research into what our computers could theoretically be used for. You see sir, I was able to create a sort of virtual filing cabinet. It's little more than a set of names and occupations right now, but it seems promising. One of my colleagues thinks he can make one of our devices simulate a stock exchange and I've heard plenty of other promising ideas around the lab too!" A brief silence ensued, as Nishoka's superior seemed to not only analyse the information he had been given, but the purpose of his employee's occupation. "Very well Nishioka, I expect to see the computers operating your new systems by the end of the week."\n\nWithin a day, most every available researcher was assisting in the computing department. Trails of wires now spewed from the computer room's double doors, keeping them firmly open. A system of monitors had been set up, allowing for numerous personnel to observe the creation of a computerized archive of staff records as well as a simulated stock exchange. The latter innovation had created something of a joke around the lab: "Whatever you do, buy more Toshiba stock now!". Indeed, once the company higher ups unveiled their latest products to the market, said joke became something more of a cry on the Tokyo exchange floor."

 jappmtakagi.19.d:0 "The warm day made it an excellent time for Prime Minister Takagi to speak with his esteemed guests in a small cottage outside of Tokyo. His days away from the endless tumult the government gave in Tokyo were rare, and even rarer did work follow him outside the city. But with men like Nakasone and Kido, a few hours would not hurt.\n\nBoth men had been audacious in their insistence to see him, after Takagi had sent his feelers out for new allies in the Lower House. While the former was certainly well-liked, his proposals for merging Kido's reformists to the Reform Bureaucrats had irritated the admiral, who curtly dismissed his appeals before another call from Koichi Kido, a man whose political maneuvering could never be kept in check.\n\nWith a number of short talks outside the government complexes of Tokyo, Kido had made an excellent case for unifying the more liberal factions in the Yokusankai. It was a great gamble to take a man as volatile to the conservative groups as Kido into his coalition, but such men would settle for a return to the Shogunate before they acquiesced to moving Japan forward. Takagi swirled the crystal glass of champagne around before giving into the sly man's offer."

He served on a cruiser under his command in the Great East Asian War, he worked as a middleman to get Imperial Navy officers to support his rise to politics, and now he struggled even harder in Takagi's grab for the seat of Prime Minister. Now he stood on an unstable mountain, where the wrong steps would see an avalanche suffocate not only the greying admiral, but Osahito and every other ally and cabinet member the Prime Minister used to reach the summit.\n\nTakagi's plan was desperate, almost the opposite of what one would expect from the fast-thinking admiral he was twenty years prior. He would settle for nothing less than to force his plans through the webs of Japanese administration, no matter the cost. Even his closest ministers felt the plan was too reckless. Both Saato and Yasushiro threatened to leave, but the charismatic Takagi sat them back down.\n\n"The path we are facing will not be made easier by conceding any more than we have and allying with those who but weeks ago wished for our downfall. Japan needs to be restructured, and I promise all of you that it will be. To leave now is not just cowardice or treachery, but to consign yourself to the continued decline of Japan and the ascendance of our national enemies." As he spoke, his eyes stabbed into everyone present with him, furious yet collected, orderly yet authoritative. He continued onwards, and by the end of his short speech, the power of the room had shifted entirely to him.\n\nHe dismissed everyone, including the young Saato. Never before had he felt so threatened and inspired. As he took the train back to his apartment, his thoughts no longer went to disbelief at Takagi's stalwartness, but plots to ensure his vision stayed true."

The Prime Minister's rooms included a single room customized for his own needs. Prime Minister Takagi found the room distractingly ornate, but it provided a place to invite Representative Kido for a number of private discussions.\n\nThe two men led some of the most liberal cliques in the party, but even then their allies would spar with each other. The old admiral had his own scores to settle with Kido's wildly unpopular plans, and Koichi found Sokichi's policies to cater too much to his pals in the Navy and the keiretsu. Yet the two would need to work together and get still another faction into their growing coalition to secure a majority in the Lower House. The unlikely target was Ikeda's Conservatives, who were not so reactionary that they were all guaranteed to dig themselves into the opposition, but compromises would have to be made.\n\nWhile the two spent the evening figuring out their approaches, the great question remained of Kido's most radical reformists; could Ikeda be brought into the coalition without destroying their own faction and forcing Takagi to search for another ally? It would only work, it seemed, if all three ringleaders were treated as equals, even if one was the Prime Minister."

But the uptight nobility of the Meiji era were not the audience he expected to meet with. Most of the fading aristocrats sent their estate managers to deliver their records, though a few showed up to personally meet with the lower-level auditors, often with complaints of how Takagi showed no respect for the greatest families of Japan. Even some of the commissioner's own subordinates were buying into their claims of unjust inspection.\n\nThe one who first began to question the legality was a rather plain auditor from Sapporo; his records showed no mention of affiliation with radicals or the Kazoku. He had even threatened to speak with a number of Japanese news agencies about the supposed 'purging' of Japan's old families to provide the Prime Minister with a slush fund. From the perspective of the average citizen, the agitator's case seemed sound. But the commissioner had not spent decades of work just to let public opinion interfere now; the Board of Audits was already a name reviled as much as any criminal gang to many.\n\nDespite all this, nobody, not even the descendants of the legendary heroes of Japan, would be above a financial review. He quickly wrote up a notice to report his subordinate, then moved on to the next family on the list."

While many of the rebel Chinese groups have been quashed, the vast territory remained a hotspot for illicit figures to make shadowy deals, far from the observant eyes of the Kempetei. Alongside the normal complaints of drug smugglers, bandits, and so-called 'exploration parties' from Russia, the valuable riches of Manchuria and its strategic position to the rest of Northern China guaranteed that whoever ran Manchukuo could turn his head and receive some very handsome sums from military leaders, local administrators, and mining executives.\n\nTakagi had spent much of his years aware of the troubles that the vast and profitable region dealt with, ever since the Mukden Incident. If he was to clean the whole Co-Prosperity Sphere from the corruption it had bathed in since the East Asian War, Manchukuo would be the ideal starting ground. While government agents had arrested some collaborators in the machinations of Manchuria's rotten workings, he wondered if he should tempt any more rats to catch before sweeping the protectorate of all those who used it to benefit themselves, or kick down the door.\n\nAs a new report of an IJA-run iron mine was delivered to his desk, his thoughts drifted to the drain, both morally and financially, these institutions had wrought upon Japan."

Over the span of two days, reports from government agents and federal police in Mukden, Dalian, and Shenyang confirmed almost all of the underhanded bureaucrats and greedy officers had been taken in for questioning, along with a slew of native Manchurians working alongside their masters in a long list of stealing funds, false reports, secret concessions to the Army and Navy, and supplying material to potential rebel groups.\n\nTakagi enjoyed the good news; even the most conservative representatives and councilors in the Imperial Diet applauded, at least publicly, the Prime Minister's most recent efforts to protect both Japanese and Manchurian from dishonorable and thuggish enemies.\n\nAnd as the televisions and radios sung their praises, the Prime Minister turned his eyes to other members of the Sphere whose administrations had been long left unchecked."

It was more than anything the companies that annoyed the commander. Space alongside one of the largest port cities in Asia was tough to find, and the transportation arms of the zaibatsu had no problem bullying the local leaders into displacing whole neighborhoods to expand their holdings. Worst of all were the other base commanders in Guangdong, who would take lifetime's worth of bribes to let these freighters dock at Imperial Navy stations.\n\nLooking out as another freighter belched smoke on its course through the ruddy water, he went to deliver a phone call to a good friend in Tokyo, urging him to put an immediate end to the blatant corruption that ran through Guangdong."

Gagged and handcuffed, all they could do was look up at the officer's guns, and pray that they would not meet their end at the firing line. The whole lot, including a few dockyard managers, had been part of an anti-corruption operation by an unnamed admiral. Frantic phone calls across the bay in the night had not given an answer, but for Rear-Admiral Kudo, he had been able to slip away from any accusations.

 jappmtakagi.27.d:0 "Takagi flicked through the dossier that had sat on his table for hours now. He didn't want to open it and read its contents, as he already knew what was inside. After a deep breath, he dashed for the files. Flicking through the papers, he read through the names of members of the National Diet that were of interest to his government. All conservatives, his eyes wafted through the list of titles, ages, names, families - everything the state could scrounge up about them, from commendments to potential scandals. There was something that tied many of these conservative politicians together: they were all still loyal to Ino.\n\nMinamoto - A childhood friend of Ino\nSugawara - A old colleague of Ino from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce\nWatanabe - A politician from Hiroshima on good terms with Ino\nTanomogi - A close financier of Ino's past campaigns\n\nThe Prime minister reclined momentarily in his seat, before lunging forwards towards his desk and grabbing a pen. Bribes, he thought to himself; the only thing that could pry these men from their loyalties to one another was significant financial gain over each other. It was ghastly disappointment to see the inner-workings of the Diet be so corrupted by money, but with his stone-cold determination to reform this system, Takagi knew he had to play this sick and kleptocratic game to win."

Although he was far from completing his 'to-do list' of economic, military, and political reform, there were certainly more successes in his lineup of propositions to the Diet. Even in votes he had lost, the Prime Minister commanded the confidence of far more conservatives in each motion.\n\nClinks of fine beverages at fancy dinners and flashy new cars at motor races; all of these lavish and luxurious lifestyle choices Takagi occasionally wedged himself in on to get on amicable terms with the conservatives in the Diet. Whilst some grew to hate him even more, a significant portion looked to him and smiled, either for his suddenly ornate appreciation of Japanese upper-class pleasures or simply for the money he slipped them. Regardless, Takagi used these tools occasionally to swing enough members under his influence, and it was working quite well.\n\nTakagi scratched the fat cat's belly, and in doing so, he had won the loyalty of a large conservative camp in the National Diet. It was a dirty move, but if it meant they would stop blocking his reforms, it was worth it. No longer having to copy the failed initiatives of the past onto tomorrow's agenda, the efforts to bribe opposition in the Diet had certainly impacted the successes of Takagi's call for reform. He had fattened their wallets with cash prizes to win their vote, and possibly a chance at changing Japan altogether."

The room was dark, lit only by the small jade lamps dotted across the room. The crack of the small burning fire was peace amongst the deluge from the night sky; its embers were calming as they roasted in the great fireplace. Takagi sat in a leather chair in the corner of his office, away from his desk, and scribbled names of politicians identified to be of use in the National Diet.\n\nThe Liberals had continually shown their affinity for reform, supporting measures and initiatives to re-invent and reorganise the ways in which we conduct domestic and foreign policy. Whilst many have been known to back his motions in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister made note of their reluctance to follow through on key policy change. Omoto, Amago, Oda - all names infamous in the Diet for rallying opposition to the Prime Minister's legislative efforts in aligning his vision for a new Japan. Takagi remembered their sneering grins. He could feel the same bubbling and seething anger he had to bury under parliamentary procedure in that moment as if they were mocking him from across the room he was currently in.\n\nAfter moments of rage, Takagi exhaled a deep breath. The rain still pummelled against the windows of his office, and his attention turned to the crackling fire. The Prime Minister knew their lack of compromise would be eased by slipping money through the cracks of their political discipline. It was a dirty move; one full of corruption, duplicity, and fraud. Even so, this was a dirty game, and if the Prime Minister could not convince the Liberals with words, he would use wealth to sway their votes in his favor.

In fact, Takagi commanded significant confidence from many in the Liberal camp, with the exception of the occasional die-hard oppositional politician who snared under his breath from the corner of his seat.\n\nThe bribes worked, and an unusual ease came over the Prime Minister. No longer fighting an uphill battle with the Liberals in the National Diet, some time and mental space was freed from these vices. "What to do now?" he thought, reclining behind his desk and thinking about his new political agenda in the Diet. A silence submerged his thoughts in a mist of confusion. How was it so easy? They had abandoned their high and mighty standards for a pretty price, and now they followed the same line of the Prime Minister they used to heckle from the stands as he read it to the crowds.\n\nWith these blocks to Takagi's aims lifted, the Liberals would seemingly roll over to his demands. Their loyalty had been bought, and they were now on-board with the Prime Minister as long as the money was slid right under the table. Time would test this mutual understanding, but for now it seemed that the Prime Minister had struck a perfect deal."

I seemingly cannot escape the corruption in the Diet, even when attempting to introduce minor legislation. It appears that I have more work to do than I had previously thought.\n\nEarlier today, I had called the diet together to discuss the matter of introducing standardized quality checks at farms across Japan. I thought it to be a trifling matter that would not take more than a few minutes to debate and vote upon. Yet before I could even finish reading my own proposal, a series of loud objections were made quite clear to me by a cluster of liberals. I therefore believed that my proposal was now doomed, due to the nagging and minute complaints of members of my own clique. Even so, the vote on the subject was to be held after lunch. There was perhaps still some hope that I could reassure the disgruntled representatives.\n\nI had taken to eating in the Lunchroom as most other members of the Diet did, mostly for the purpose of keeping an eye on my opponents but also for the quality of the food. I was pleased to see the offending liberals there, as I had hoped to sit with them to resolve the matter before the vote. Yet as I was about to approach their table, I noticed that two others had joined them. These were men that I was familiar with, reliable politicians who believed firmly in my cause. Observing from afar, I noted the jovial nature of the conversation. It appeared that they had beaten me to implementing my own plan. However, just as the conversation broke off, I witnessed the quick transfer of paper money to the objecting liberals. I focused entirely on eating my food for the rest of lunch.\n\nWhen the votes were tallied, it did not surprise me when my proposal was approved by the Diet.

Yet as he gazed out of his office window, it became apparent that six accountants would indeed be needed. A second car pulled up at the steps and the driver began to onload a number of large boxes, each one containing documents. "I suppose those are the financial files we will be looking over," inquired the Prime Minister. The accountants replied with a respectful nod.\n\nEventually, the seven or so boxes were delivered to the Prime Minister's office. Their work could begin. Immediately, it became apparent that little effort had been put in properly organizing the documents. Although not directly involved in the process of organizing, Takagi would occasionally request an update on their progress. "It would appear that the think tanks are trying to make this a challenge for us. We've had to re-organize everything in these boxes."\n\n"Prime Minister, I believe it pertinent that you see this. Once you begin looking at the whole picture, you realise that money simply pours in and out of these think tanks. They've separated their budgets from the sections detailing their funding. Here, you'll see they've accepted money from-"\n\n"The military, Diet representatives, and a number of corporations, sir," chimed in another accountant. "They've carefully hidden their real records within these ones. If you give us more time, we should be able to decipher more."

He had similar feelings about the decor, but unlike the food, the design was not to his taste. Regardless, he ate his meals without complaint and focused mostly on casually observing other members of the diet from the strategic placement of his cabinet minister table. He could now recognise virtually anyone who regularly ate in the lunchroom, whether they were a Representative or a Peer.\n\nIt therefore came as a surprise to him when two men that he had never seen before sat down at the table for cabinet members as if that had been their dining table since birth. They clearly knew each other, as Takagi observed their relaxed and cheery conservation from a few feet away. His gaze did not break from the pair, even as their conversation turned to idle chatter upon starting their meal. Eventually, they noticed the Prime Minister staring at them. Clearly put off by the look they were getting from Takagi, they silently greeted him with a respectful nod and then hastily finished their meal in silence.\n\nThe Prime Minister returned to his office, considering the offensive sight he had witnessed. There was no doubt that they were new members of his cabinet, or they would not have dared to breach decorum by occupying the cabinet table. Yet Takagi had not appointed them to his cabinet. He certainly never would, based on their behaviour in the lunchroom. No, someone else had selected these two for cabinet positions without informing him. While he intended to eventually discover the perpetrator, the Prime Minister was in truth more concerned with finding an excuse to get rid of his unwanted subordinates. Once he had replaced them with suitable choices, the message would be quite clear enough."

The Prime Minister has just announced that several think tanks have been taking money from generals and corporations!" Kenichi dismissed his older brother's concern as another overreaction to what had probably been an open secret for ages. Taken slightly aback that his younger brother had once again dismissed the news, Teruo restated that it only once again proved that the Prime Minister was truly committed to reform. This had not been the first time he had exposed high-level corruption, after all. "Why else would he so publically share something that affects even the most secretive parts of our society?" Clearly annoyed by his brother's insistence, Kenichi finally turned to look at Teruo. "All you've done since graduating from university is sit at home and read the papers. There's a whole world out there! Go out and find a job!"\n\nSensing his cause was quite lost, Teruo returned to his newspaper. He probably did need a job. It would certainly take his mind off things. The job listings proved quite boring and disheartening until he came upon the last thing he could have possibly expected. One of the think tanks was searching for a junior economist. "It looks like that degree might finally pay off, huh?" The older brother tossed the paper towards his sibling, who proceeded to pick it up after it narrowly missed the TV.

The results of the vote were often dubious too, although the level of interference was ultimately decided by the Prime Minister and the wider Taisei Yokusankai. Usually this took the form of intimidating independent candidates or making last minute changes to polling stations and minor electoral regulations. Prime Minister Takagi had, until recently, largely focused his attention on other matters, but now a report had arrived on his desk. It seemed he would have to consider the future of the Japanese electoral process.\n\nThe report outlined possible ways that a potential future election could be rigged in favour of the government. It would work, there was no question about that in Takagi's mind. However, as the public was more than aware of previous electoral fraud, Takagi would certainly suffer a blow to his standing with the populace. Realising that he could not possibly make a decision on whether to commit to the plan now, the Prime Minister dismissed the advisors in his office and bade them return in the afternoon.\n\nIn truth, losing face with the public was not something Takagi wished to deal with. He had worked hard to earn the trust of a population that had grown tired by years of negligent governments and army obstruction. Yet this downside was in many ways a tactical loss, rather than a strategic one. If Takagi increased his strength in the Imperial Diet, then he would be far more capable of implementing his own reforms. Many of said reforms would go a long way in improving the lives of Japanese people. Prime Minister Takagi was now sure of his choice.

During the hour-long bus ride, the classes' teacher Kagawa-san had taken the opportunity to go into greater detail about what their trip was about. The government had begun a new initiative to promote an interest in politics in the younger generations. Part of this involved taking a few classes to visit the Imperial Diet Building, where they would get to witness politics in action. Kagawa-san was careful to remind her students they were to be exceptionally well-behaved in the Diet Building, as it was in that place that their future was being decided. Ryo vowed to remember that.\n\nTo the disappointment of the class, they were not let in through the grand front entrance of the National Diet building. Instead, they entered through a side door and had their bags searched. With that done, the children were finally allowed into the building proper, where they were greeted by a Mihara-San, who was to be their guide. Ryo listened diligently to Mihara-San's descriptions of the Diet's many rooms and their functions, but it was the stunning architecture that truly captured his attention. The central hall, with its ornately carved walls and arches, landscape paintings and shining glasswork stuck with Ryo the most. Mihara-San did a good job of capturing the class's attention, so when he announced that they would now be attending a session of the Diet, many of them were quite excited. The House of Representatives' chamber was equally as impressive as the entrance hall, with the added benefit of comfortable seating. As the grand chamber filled with the representatives of the Diet, Ryo was eager to hear what they would be discussing. As it turned out, the meeting of the Diet was in fact rather dull.

The audits had yielded plenty of evidence against certain independents, but it was ultimately up to Takagi to decide what would become of them. The first file pertained to a man he recognised. He had been a promising naval officer, whose career had been cut short by a sudden desire to play politics. Takagi considered him a good friend, even if they did have their disagreements on policy. "I needn't say that it would be stupid to exectute and imprison every independent. I think I'll select a few of them at random. That should produce the desired effect."\n\nTakagi continued his examination of the audits. He came across a few more friends, some of whom had crossed the line on a few occasions. Regardless, The Prime Minister quickly placed them into the pile of those that would be spared. Most of the other Independents were not men he knew especially well, little more than nuisances in his mind. Sending a few of them to prison would lose the Prime Minister no sleep. Some of the audits had produced little in the way of evidence, while others contained solid proof of treason. Either way, Takagi selected them at random with an efficient pace.\n\nIt was only when he read the file of another one of his friends that he paused. He was another naval officer, although his career had been much longer. He turned to politics after retiring from the Navy. As an independent his focus has been on local politics for his small rural community in Yamagata. Yet it appeared that he had made some deals with foreign companies, and used his connections in the navy to smuggle them Japanese goods. Takagi was deeply distrubed by the actions of his trusted friend. He all but dropped the file into the pile of the guilty, before reconsidering and placing it in the opposite stack. "He'll learn his lesson", the Prime Minister thought to himself."

All but the essential staff at the Imperial Diet had gone home for the day, which had turned the usually bustling and noisy halls rather more quiet. It was this time of day that the Prime Minister used to reflect upon current events, as well as his own recent actions and decisions. He could not deny that he had made good progress in terms of implementing democratic reforms.\n\nThe school tours of the Imperial Diet had proved successful; More young people than ever had expressed interest in joining the YSK, and many more were eager to vote in the next election. The best result had perhaps been the increased support for the government among the youth. There had been successes in other areas too. The independents had recently proven more agreeable in the Diet, ever since their numbers were slightly thinned through the auditing process. Even more corruption, Takagi's ever-present enemy, had been purged through a recent examination of the Think-Tanks. Not only had this yet again weakened bribery and subversion, but it had markedly improved the effectiveness of the Think-Tanks themselves. For the first time in a while, they were actually doing their jobs.\n\nProgress had been swift and certainly efficient. Still, this left the Prime Minister with a single linger question: "Has too much been done, in too little time?" This was not the first time Takagi had feared that his reforms had been rushed through without enough thought given to long term consequences. He reminded himself this was the inevitable effect of hindsight. The dice had been cast in his favour, now all Takagi could do was plan his next turns carefully. Precise and steady reform was necessary, but nothing would truly get his enemies off his back. The Ship had set sail long ago and the Captain was now bound to sail it safely into port."

They had leads on uncovering corruption and embezzlement in government pay and were gathering evidence on clear criminal activity so they could reach a just conclusion.\n\nNoticing great differences between individual civil servants and certain officers in the IJA, Nakasone glanced between two printed sheets spread out across the floor. He called to the rest of the cabinet to notice that even in senior positions, their pay was not even comparable to various colonial administrators throughout the empire. Moreover, and much to Takagi's displeasure, it seemed that different members of government were receiving varying levels of pay. Scandal, he called it, grabbing the papers from Nakasone's hands and gazing at the payrolls; the Prime Minister decided that it was up to him to reverse such excessive greed."

 jappmtakagi.40.d:0 "The foamy pacific waves crashed against the great harbors as Takagi had sent investigators across the empire in search of the nation's criminal fraudsters. Based on information gathered with his cabinet, the Prime Minister had requested a survey of all major Japanese ports in search of misappropriated funds, resources, and labor. The investigations went through mostly unchallenged in major dockyards but often faced the scowls and sneers of officers made uncomfortable with the poking and prodding of anti-corruption officials.\n\nSome cabinet members were quick to point out that the Prime Minister, himself of a naval background in the IJN, may impede the successes of the investigations by covering up details on account of his history as a naval officer. Outraged by the infidelity of his own ministers, Takagi lashed back in a tense dispute - eventually coming to an agreement that his domestic minister, Horikiri Zenjiro, should be delegated the authority to carry out the inquiry across the country."

They shook hands and sat opposite to each other whilst discussing Tadashi's findings; the Prime Minister was fascinated by the responsibilities of the military in defense and administration across Asia. Also being presented with Ino's 1962 report on the economic affairs of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Takagi drew his attention to the great costs of this military bureaucracy.\n\nIn truth, the Armed Forces' role across Asia was bloated and inefficiently organized. They racked up billions of Yen each year, and often found themselves inadequately trained or running particularly repressive administrations over civilian populations. The Prime Minister, now aware of the great burden to reform the colonial responsibilities of the empire, closed the report and leaned back in his chair and let out a deep breath - preparing himself for the great task at hand."

Overall, military involvement in the governance of Taiwan was the most tame; as the 'model colony' acquired in the Japan-Qing War, the people of Taiwan had grown accustomed to and comfortable with IJA presence across the island. The island was vastly underdeveloped, however, and was in desperate need of modernizing. However, cooperation between natives, Japanese settlers, and the IJA formed a uniquely constructive community in Taiwan - striking a pleasing balance for the Prime Minister.\n\nChoson was a different story, however. Repeated abuses of the native population by the IJA had been reported by civilian organizations as they used slave labor in military administration. Things were particularly brutal in the north of the peninsula, where local populations were regularly worked for the benefit and sometimes entertainment of corrupt and irresponsible military officials. The Prime Minister was aware of the particularly gluttonous governance of southern Choson, particularly in major cities, but news of the abuses in the north and rural regions revolted him."

 jappmtakagi.43.d:0 "Sifting further through Tadashi's dossier, Takagi read of the military presence in Southeast Asia. Garrisons were freckled throughout the region, undertaking patrols throughout the dense jungles and rambling cities of the region. Indeed, the nations of Southeast Asia had largely been deferential towards the Empire of Japan.\n\nWhat was to be noted was how unnecessary the presence of thousands of troops in single regions were to the integrity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Not only did this burden Tokyo with sky-high costs in growing military budgets, but the overbearing residence of our troops agitated the local populations and often proliferated anti-Japanese sentiment. Where the power really rested, however, was in the IJN that dominated the South China Sea and Indonesian Archipelago, influencing the affairs of collaborationist governments through corrupt dealings and threats of bombardment. Takagi rubbed his eyes and scribbled down the notes of his findings as he read on, hoping to come up with a conclusive argument for colonial reform in the region."

 jappmtakagi.44.t:0 "식민지 상황 - 중국"
 jappmtakagi.44.d:0 "The Prime Minister had come to the section of the report he felt he knew, opening each page armed with a skepticism of legal IJA activities in China. He certainly approved of military administrations across the region, maintaining a firm paternalism over the affairs of the Chinese. However, reading reports detailing IJA abuses in rural regions, the Takagi was troubled more by the accounts of massacres, weapons tests, and other atrocities committed against the local populace.\n\nThis was too common among the undisciplined troops in China, Takagi thought, it was bad for the civilian interaction with their Japanese benefactors. He scoffed; what bastard thought that slave labor, random acts of killing, and the rapes of entire households of women would increase their opinion of us? So, after spending some time massaging his temples, Takagi took the time to begin piecing together notes and ideas on how to end the juvenile negligence of duty in the Chinese regions, and make the IJA a force worthy of fear and respect. After all, if the Japanese were to maintain their rule in China, they would have to do it well."

Skimming over the paragraphs explaining statistics and operations, it was clear to the Prime Minister that the IJA largely relied on the collaborator government in defending the region.\n\nThe military of the Azad Hind government was large enough to defend much of its territories, only requesting Japanese support in strategic and intelligence operations. Indeed, with IJA advisors as comfortable friends as well as allies with officials in Calcutta, the region was not nearly dominated by the military affairs of the empire. Takagi came to the conclusive paragraph, nodding and informed, noting the contingency of the numbers of Japanese forces within Indian territories in the withdrawals that he may request."

The Prime Minister and his cabinet had spent hours of their time sifting through statistics, reports, and graphs, and this was their moment to present a conclusive declaration of the government's actions towards corruption and misappropriation throughout the military.\n\nAfter finalizing his government's opinions on the report, Takagi announced that cuts to the IJA were going to be made across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, withdrawing military personnel and tightening the budget. Many advisors with ties to the armed forces gasped and grumbled, and Takagi raised his voice to quell the ambiguities and outrage among his small audience. Dealing with their reactions will be the hardest part of this process, he thought, before smiling at the advisors and taking questions."

They're gonna have to deal with a flood of thanks and praise for him, even if they don't like his navy roots."\n\nThey relax themselves, cracking their knuckles and enjoying the pleasantries of the home isles. Another young officer arrives at the table, carrying with him several alcoholic drinks, which are then distributed around the table.\n\n"What are you guys talking about?" he states as he takes his seat.\n\nOne of the less sociable officers, sitting in a corner seat and smoking, speaks up. "Our friend over here believes that the withdrawal of the garrisons is going to get Takagi in with the higher-ups, and it might do, for a while. But, ultimately, flooding the home islands with troops who have nothing to do is only going to go bad for him. What he doesn't know is that at any moment, all the praise is gonna disappear if he makes the wrong room, and then what."

 jappmtakagi.48.d:0 "It is the old men who drag down every one of our reforms, it is the old men who blindly cling to the ideals of the old Japan. It is the old men who act as dripping manifestations of social inertia across the political battlefields of the nation. It is only right that, with time, the political establishment must wipe away vestiges of bygone eras. Or, at least, that is what Takagi thought as he ordered his allies and followers to cut ties with, or even ostracize, the old men of the Tōseiha, an informal web of political alliances dating back to the 20s. And, after a few weeks of silence, Takagi sat back with relief at the success of the operation. There would be no battle, it would seem, over letting sick dogs loose.\n\nThat would be until, the next morning, a letter appeared on top of the stack of papers he was to read through and sign. Opening it with deliberation, Takagi read the words on top; "A warning, for the Prime Minister's eyes." Pulling out the letter from the envelope, Takagi anxiously glanced over the paragraphs contained within. The letter detailed a plan, abound with blackmail and scandal, which would bring about the downfall of the Takagi government if the old men were not welcomed, with open arms, back into both the Tōseiha and the administration. Apparently, from what the letter said, nearly the entire government bureaucracy was waiting for the right moment to overthrow Takagi, and his ever-despised reforms.\n\nThe day, then forward, moved at a distorted pace. At every mark of his pen, at every sentence read, Takagi could not help but survey his environment. A secretary pushing a cart down a hallway. The clock ticking, and ticking, and ticking again. Once his cabinet, at last, came to meet with him, he wrangled them into a spare closet. Each of them, after looking over the letter, laughed it off. After closer inspection, it was discovered that several titles and names were misspelled, the letter's plans didn't really make sense, and its claims were far too grandiose. At the behest of his advisers, Takagi threw the letter in the trash, and moved on with the day. It could only be a bluff... right?"

After making a mess of his office, throwing old pens and discarded contracts all over the floor, the old man arrives at his goal. A torn-up letter sits in Takagi's hands, the one he discarded earlier that day. Reaching into a drawer in his desk, Takagi finds a small flask, the contents of which he shakily pours over the letter. Takagi takes the letter, soaking wet in alcohol, out into the parking lot of the National Diet Building. He pulls a lighter from his pocket, and flicks at it a few times before setting the letter alight. Takagi lets go of the letter as it burns, transforming it into mere ash in the wind.\n\nThe night is sleepless. Takagi arrives at the office with his eyes burning, stumbling around woozily. It continues like this for weeks on end, until Takagi is at last able to meet with his cabinet. The cabinet sets up in the boardroom in a sombre quiet, all while Takagi stares forward, unwavering in his sight. "So..." Takagi whispers forward. "There is no plot, no revolt, to depose us. The letter was lying."\n\nNakasone puts his hands forward, and gives a gentle chuckle. "Well... of course, I thought we already proved this? It was amateur work. I would be delighted to see anyone try to pull off the plan in that letter." Nakasone looks around with a bright smile, while the rest of the cabinet laugh. The thought that the entire bureaucracy would revolt because a few old men lost their place in society was, indeed, amusing.\n\nTakagi delivers a heavy heave, before joining his cabinet in laughter. It was, after all, just an empty threat. Takagi's laughter is, however, underlined by a lingering anxiety. If a few old men could have such an effect on him, what about the rest of the targets of his reforms? Would these threats remain empty? The path forward is dark, and our only light is our dwindling hopes."

This chair presided over the rows upon rows of Japan's noblemen, each staring at Takagi. The chair was a massive piece of decor, made of ornately carved and polished Sugi. Takagi settled his arms uncomfortably within its bounds, the hard back of the chair already taking its toll on his spine. The throne of the Emperor, colorful in its design and of a heavenly, regal craft, sat empty a few feet behind the seat of the Prime Minister. The last time he had been in the House of Peers, years and years ago, he had only sat in the observer's balcony. He couldn't remember much, only that he held a distaste for these men of privilege who took it upon themselves to abuse the positions and promises of their forefathers.\n\nOnce the crowd settled down, and the aides began motioning him to begin, he sat up, his pre-prepared speech in his hands. Takagi read, "it is my formal duty, as the Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan, to announce this opening of the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet. It is in this moment that I wish to, in front of you, our most noble servants of the Emperor, address what changes are to be expected under my administration in comparison to those of old. It is no secret that I, and those in my administration, believe that the nature and systems of our nation, as they currently stand, are unsustainable. The corruption of Hiroya Ino's government, and the interference of the government in the market, cannot stand if we wish for our nation to truly prosper..."\n\nAlready, just a few sentences into his speech, and the House of Peers was in uproar. What was, at first, whisperings between Peers, became conversations and underhanded mockery in an instant. Takagi was stunned. Where was the noble stoicism? Were the Peers not to be quiet servants of the Empire? Takagi looked around with confusion, the bickering of the Peers giving him head pain he had only experienced after long, grueling arguments in the lower house.

Budget, infrastructure, anti-corruption measures, it doesn't matter what the bill contains, it won't change the result. So, you got a bill you wanna pass, but no one else does. You see, our ever-humble public servants have found it to be most profitable to sell their votes. What you and I know as 'government' is, in reality, an auction building. Our tax dollars flow up and into the blender of the Diet, to be distributed to whichever politician's vote is most important. You don't have to be rich to play the game, to dance that fandango just use your second bank account, otherwise known as the 'treasury'. Once your allies are salted with cash, time to move onto the hardballs. To get those bastards on board, whip out the pork barrel, and start funneling cash into their hands for 'administrative purposes'. Alright, you still don't have the votes, time to do some favors. A fishing regulation here, an unbanning of underground bureaucratic channels there, whatever needs to be shoved into the bill to get it to pass. Keep ramming it in, and nothing can go wro- was that the flash of a camera I heard? Uh-oh, the press is on your tail, time to start flooding all the media channels you know with cash and hoping they don't release evidence of your corruption. But... if they do release the evidence, just claim that you and your cronies deserve the extra money for your hard and dedicated efforts in improving the nation. The bill is on the Diet floor now, and sure to pass. By the way, what was this bill about again? Who cares. Your job as an administrator has been fulfilled. Now, let us move onto the House of Peers..."\n\nTakagi grimaced as he read over the satirical comic. It was an underground publication, backed by American money. Even so, large parts of it rung true. Corruption was an ever-present spectre in legislative matters. No matter how much Takagi didn't want to be involved, he was forced to "dance that fandango," as the comic stated, in order to be anything more than a figurehead Prime Minister."

I can't land a finger on his pulse, his goals are beyond me, but whatever they are, I have no interest in fulfilling them.\n\nOut of the ear-piercing cacophony of Kido's rant, dulcet tones ring out.

He slips over a bundle of papers, a proposal he's been cooking up, no doubt.\n\n"If I may, my apologies Kido, but I would like to bring up the subject of a new economic reform that I have been researching for the past few weeks." Of course. "Basically, the premise is that we loosen price controls, and the market will use the extra room in order to situate on the most consumer and market-friendly prices themselves. Surprisingly, after looking into it, such a policy would yield an uptick in Gross Domestic Product yet unseen in our administration."\n\nYeah, no it wouldn't.

This institution, the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, served as his home and learning environment for several years. The paint was wearing, the stones eroding, and the roof tiles breaking off. It was a monument to a simple, idealistic past which, in reality, never existed. Walking through its front doors, Takagi was sent on a nostalgia trip. A young man, who believed that he could transform the IJN from the inside, who would go on to see his innocence and naivety ripped from him in the fire and blood of empire.\n\nIt was in those classrooms that he was taught absolute discipline and the strategies of naval warfare. He remembered the long-dead teachers who saw to it that he would grow up to be an honorable servant of the Emperor. It was in those cafeterias that he ate salted rice for years on end to train his instinctual desires. Looking over the walls, he spotted photos of his class, fifty years ago. Young men, old friends, smiling towards the future. Some died in the East Asia War. Most drifted apart. This was a somber place, more so than he remembered.\n\nWhile examining a model of the battleship Yamato, Takagi noticed a figure in the empty halls of the academy. A janitor, mopping the floors. Looking him over, seeing his slow, cyclic movements, Takagi felt a strange sensation. This man, whoever he was, reminded him of his younger self, but a younger self that could never feel the glory of the Empire nor the hope of social mobility. This man could have been the next great admiral or at least a dedicated sailor. Instead, this janitor, who looks to be in his 30s, has had his life ended right here, in these halls.\n\nTakagi walked out, his head down, as dedicated as he was those fifty years ago. Educational opportunities would be expanded, and he would make sure his cabinet saw it through. No more languishing.

New electrical wiring and sewage systems had begun to fill the ground beneath Tokyo, above which came the new streets and buildings. The capital was beginning to gain the verticality of a modern city, but the changes had not gone unchallenged. Among the many districts deemed suitable for redevelopment was Asakusa, a district of the Taito ward. Not only was the area to be extensively modernized, it was to receive another train line, the first of many to be added to the metro network. This new section of the network would connect the city center with the southern residential areas. The announcement of the Toei Asakusa line had, like much of the development work, been advertised heavily. Asakusa's streets were dotted with billboards and neon lights hailing the meto's imminent arrival. Yet the populace had not been keen to see it or much else of the development.\n\nSince work had begun, the district had been rocked by protests. Beloved buildings, designated for demolition, were occupied by locals, and it was not uncommon for construction workers to be stopped from working by large crowds. Some of the crews had even laid down their tools and joined the Asakusans. The center of the protests was at the Senso-ji Buddhist temple, where residents of Asakusa maintained a constant encampment.\n\nWith construction beginning to fall well behind schedule, pressure was now on Prime Minister Takagi's government to respond with decisive action. Investors and developers were adamant that the Prime Minister should respond with force to bring a swift end to the delays. Yet other voices suggested that sending in riot police and strike-breakers would defeat the point of any development. A tactful and populist gesture would be to make a donation to the Senso-ji temple, and make some accommodations for the people of Asakusa."

After a sigh, he slung his arm forward to reach for the folder, scowling at the uncertain gaze of the police commissioners who had gathered in his presence to discuss the unrest. As he flicked through the files, one of the men piped up with a rough voice, stuttering out a suggestion.\n\n"Prime Minister, we do advise that we take caution with these groups; force may push them further to radicalism. At this moment, they are in a position to be talked to and negotiated with - something that could be used to our advantage. If we set the example here, by limiting our force and compromising with the citizens, we may find a solution and a way out of this mess for good."\n\nThe words of the man irked Takagi, but he was right; perhaps putting down the batons and hoses would be a better idea. Sweat clung to his body and a shivery prickle ran down his back. The soreness of his eyes ached from beneath his skull.

The youth of today were born in the Emperor's victory, a time of unique peace and prosperity, but they knew war just like any generation before.\n\nMilitarism had entrenched itself into society during the Great East Asian War, and its warring culture had now coalesced around the youth. IJA and IJN recruitment is rife in universities, well-established in libraries, and praised by the government itself. With a cemented, undying devotion to defending East Asia, propping up their fathers' military conquests had developed a pride in these young men that only violence could satiate.\n\nWith Japan's rising affluence in the twentieth century, urbanisation had risen as populations flocked into cities. Travelling from rural communities, many young people had come in search of wealth, employment, or a new start. The mingling of these varied forms of language, mannerisms, and personal philosophies created a distinctively eccentric class of urbanites loyal to the Imperial throne.\n\nHowever, it has been observed that groups in universities, theatres, and youth organisations have developed an odd affinity for American culture. Smuggled literature is distributed in secret, jazz music has seen a resurgence along with popular American tunes, and some have even begun to cut their hair in American styles and use American words.\n\nThe youth of Tokyo have come to represent the most idiosyncratic aspects of the fringes of Japanese society, but as absurd as the youth seems, they remain committed to the Emperor, and to Japan."

 jappmtakagi.103.d:0 "From the glittering cultural districts to the growing residential areas in the city's south, nearly all of Tokyo had been included in Prime Minister Takagi's ambitious development project. Even Chiyoda, the special ward of Tokyo that contained the Imperial Palace, was to see extensive construction work. Parts of the National Gardens would be redeveloped to better accommodate the metro at Tokyo station, as well as a number of new roads. These wer e to allow for traffic to better flow through the heart of the capital. Maintenance work was to be done on all key government buildings. Not only were the roads leading to these vital centers to be completely replaced, but the buildings themselves were to receive expensive renovations.\n\nChiyoda's small population made it fairly easy for contractors and the to proceed with their plan without much popular discontent. Instead, it was the Imperial Household Ministry who keenly expressed displeasure with the redevelopment. The grounds had largely remained the same since the Chrysanthemum throne's move to Tokyo and it seemed as if the ministry would resist any attempt to change that fact.\n\nAlready, the Prime Minister had received numerous complaints from the minister, all containing demands to remove the Palace grounds from the development plan entirely. Parts of the cabinet, including Koichi Kido, felt that making some accommodations for the Imperial Palace would be reasonable enough. Development could then carry on without the threat of Imperial disapproval hanging over the entire operation. Other voices, notably the new guard liberals, were adamant to not surrender to the Imperial household ministry. They instead proposed that the Prime Minister stand his ground, possibly make a few bribes and simply wait for the letters of objection to cease. With no one wishing to see construction to grind to a halt, Prime Minister Takagi would need to make his decision immediately."

 jappmtakagi.104.d:0 "Tokyo was always a loud and modern city, but the drive for recent urban development by the Takagi government had made it even more energised and lively. By day, the light rail systems charged between city districts, shepherding great masses of accountants, engineers, and technicians to their places of employment. By night, the white haze of street lights illuminated the once darkened areas of the city, and thousands flocked to fill their bellies in the restaurants with warm foods not provided in ration-packs.\n\nThe city moved faster, worked harder, and seemed much happier to have benefitted from these infrastructural improvements. The percentage of homes with access to electricity, adequate sanitation, and central heating increased significantly, and these improvements were certainly recognised. Indeed, citizens within the city expressed their support for the Takagi administration, and hoped for further development of Tokyo worthy of true international prestige."

He sat down, extending his arm from behind his desk to offer the two men a seat in the chairs adjacent to his.\n\n"With our recent investments into the city's infrastructure, we have determined that Tokyo requires your firm to re-evaluate the capacities of the electrical grid." Takagi then nodded his head to signal to a secretary to reveal a large and colorful graph depicting current energy capacity, contrasted with future energy requirements.\n\nThe representatives gulped, one leaned forward to observe the intricacies of the graph, the other coughed and covered his mouth with his gloved hand.\n\n"Prime Minister, this... this is monumental. We would -"\n\n"Be met with an opportunity to power the capital and reap immense reward," interrupted a firm and determined Takagi. A brief moment of silence followed. Takagi introduced the men to his Minister for the Economy, Yasuhiro Nakasone, and then rested his hands on the desk. "Tokyo has new offices, homes, and metro stations... we want you to reconfigure the grid to power them."\n\nThe two men glanced at each other, and turned back to Takagi. One was impressed, the other looked curious. Takagi smiled, and reached over for a fountain pen.\n\n"Let us begin. How shall we do this?""

Weeks of negotiation had led him to this point. He leaned over slightly to his side as he pressed his fingers into his back to massage his sore body, now he could rest knowing the task was complete.\n\nThe TEPCO negotiations had come to a conclusion in the fateful hours preceding Takagi's breather, and an agreement had finally been made. With the ink still fresh on the papers resting on his desk, the flickering recent memories of shaking hands over the table were a personal victory for the Prime Minister, as well as a political one. His heavy eyelids grew heavier; Takagi peered out of the slither of vision unclaimed by his fatigue to glance once more at the clauses and statements freckling the signed agreement.\n\nTokyo was to have its power grids restructured and reconfigured, so that the city could generate and use more electricity whilst keeping waste and cost at a minimum. For the benefit of the city's citizenry, and the businesses that draw in billions of Yen each year, electricity would be made more affordable and accessible. Takagi drew in a final deep breath, reaching for his coat that was perched on the hangar, looking back at the papers on the desk once more, before turning off the desk lamp and leaving for the Kantei."

 japtakagirecon.1.d:0 "Takagi sat with his men, surrounded in a busy and regal bar with Tokyo's elites. Soft keys of the piano were playing as the general chatter of the room was a low hum. Although visibly at ease, the Prime Minister spoke sternly to his men about a very serious issue.\n\n"Make no mistake, gentlemen, we have come a very long way. We've practically stomped out corruption from the dark corners of the Diet and Civil Service, and the economy has more or less recovered. May we drink to that tonight."\n\nThe cabinet sat with the Prime Minister, sipping on glasses of champagne and leaning back in their circle of chairs. Zenjiro blew a puff of his cigarette, and Kido chewed on a small snack provided with his round of drinks. After they had clinked their glasses a second time and chuckled, Takagi continued his speech.\n\n"I hate to say it, though, our work is not over. The students and protesters demand more from us, beyond what I am actually willing to give to them-"\n\n"I knew this would blow up in our faces," Nakasone interrupted, scoffing and clearly tipsy from his drinks, "I wished they knew how good we're being to them."\n\nTakagi looked over at Nakasone with a frown, but eased his intimidation after noticing that he was merry from the champagne. Nakasone wasn't incorrect, Takagi admitted to himself, now sitting in silence among his chattering colleagues."

 japtakagirecon.2.d:0 "In a dark, candle-lit study, Shidzue Kato was typing up her final notes for her next piece. With each punch of the keys, another letter was added to her paragraphs decrying the Takagi government and the Taisei Yokusankai for their moderation and restraint in issues she determined were "non-negotiable" and "integral to the freedom of men and women."\n\nThe Prime Minister received a copy of the article the day it was published, sneering at the mere sight of it. He flicked through the piece, trying to find humor in its ridiculous claims and outrageous accusations. Dripping with irony, the Prime Minister noted that the only reason the public had access to such defamatory literature was because of his recent relaxation of press censorship, to which he scoffed and smirked as he tossed the article to his side."

The economic woes that plagued the nation and the limited rights of students have been at the forefront of their complaints as they harass the Kentai and other institutions for solutions to their desperate difficulties.\n\nTakagi sat in his office overlooking the streets, reading reports of the protests from intelligence services. Law enforcement did their best to contain the protests and lead them away from important buildings, periodically skirmishing with the occasional brave student who dared challenge the authority of an officer. The situation did not seem to improve for the government, and the rage of the crowds only intensified in the Prime Minister's quiet neglect."

 japtakagirecon.4.d:0 ""Our economy is certainly recovering, Prime Minister. Everything seems to be lining up just as we need."\n\nNakasone, Takagi's Economic Minister, stood across the conference room surrounded by panels of graphs and charts, presenting his findings to the Prime Minister and the rest of the cabinet. Wielding a presentation pointer, he commanded the room's attention to pie charts of revenue diversification, bar graphs of income in each region, and line graphs predicting the growth of the Japanese economy in the next few fiscal years. Waving his hands in front of him while explaining the potential of the Japanese market share, his crooked smile crept across his face, pleased with the recognition he had now achieved.\n\nAfter a moment of small applause ended abruptly by the Prime Minister, Nakasone continued his speech with Takagi's begrudging permission. He cleared his throat and unveiled a new selection of graphs, grinning like a child showing off his new toys. Nakasone announced his proposition to go the extra mile; praising a free-market model used in many Western countries, he brought the attention of the cabinet to his prospects of budding market liberalisation across the Empire.\n\nWhilst Takagi sat at the head of the conference room's table, overshadowing all the members of his cabinet before him, it seemed as if Nakasone had convinced a handful of these men with his preaching to deregulate and privatize state-controlled assets. Takagi knew he couldn't win every battle, and thought that perhaps Nakasone had a point. He would show some respect for the minister for the time being, but Takagi's unfriendly stare reminded Nakasone of his place - subordinate to the Prime Minister."

Takagi sat behind the mighty desk and was still in his chair, staring down at Nakasone with tired eyes. Nakasone, somewhat unphased by this encounter, reclined in his seat and gazed back at the Prime Minister. Both of the men knew what they were here to discuss, but Takagi, drained of any sane patience, could barely bring himself to face Nakasone's endless proposals.\n\n"Mister Prime Minister... I know you're tired... we all are. We've come a long way since the crash, and the economy seems to be in a good place! I have here with me some plans, and I'm sure they are worth reading."\n\nAs Nakasone pulled out the fat dossier from his suitcase, the Prime Minister sighed and rolled his eyes, clearly trying to keep himself away from the brinks of anger. A seething haze blurred over Takagi's vision, as the minutes crept slowly through Nakasone's ramblings.\n\n"... We outline three 'Grand Pillars': Privatization, Fiscal Responsibility, and Export Deregulation. We clearly need not look beyond opinion in the Diet and among lobbyists; this is exactly what they want. We command their support for these liberalizations, and it is sure to bring Japan riches. To shy away from this... well I don't think we'd last for much longer in the seats we are sitting in. Now, with the economic developments throughout the Empire stabilizing, we are taking this as a green light to-"\n\n"Nakasone." the Prime Minister interrupted, visibly irritated and knowing he must concede, "What do you want here?"

These men were the leading figures in Japan's keiretsu firms; their secret agreements fattened their profits by the second as their corporate influence began to stretch across the Empire. They clinked champagne glasses and grumbled to each other, lightly snacking on the extravagant refreshments prepared for the occasion. Nakasone, eager to begin his consultation, stood up from his seat and clinked on his glass to gather the room's attention.\n\n"Gentlemen. Our government has gone forward with plans to free our choked-up economy. Deregulation. Privatization. You've heard it all before, and now it's happening."\n\nHe continued with his speech, and as he preached of economic reform, the businessmen's grins grew hungrier; it was only a matter of time before vicious, yet immensely profitable, competition could begin. The slouched men sat forward with their attention firmly commanded by the bright and beautiful words of the Nakasone. Their eyes sparkled and glistened, looking like piranhas ready to dart at any moment. By the end of his address, the men applauded Nakasone with a passion like no other. Though they appeared to support the movements of the government, with some even getting up to shake Nakasone's hand and chuckle, it was clear they craved only one thing - the sooner the deregulation came, the sooner they could sink their teeth into each other's profits. There was an odd shift of control in the area; the now upright tycoons mingled as experts in their fields, as enemies in public, but as allies at least for now. Nakasone felt a sense of achievement as he had the support of these men, but suddenly and frighteningly in that gloomy amber room, he felt outnumbered."

He trembled, as if a schoolboy preparing to give a speech in front of class. It had taken a lot of effort to wrangle together the big four, or big three more accurately, to hear out his proposal. The delegates were, to put it lightly, ancient. The old men, veterans of decades of corporate struggle and Zaibatsu antics, fiddled with their pens and straightened their papers as Nakasone coughed to prepare his voice.\n\n"G-gentlemen, we sit here today to discuss the possibilities presented to the free market by the deregulation and privatization policies of Sōkichi Takagi's government. We in the administration look to the private sector as the next area of reform if we are to maintain the prosperity and growth of Japan and the Dai Tōa Kyōei Ken."\n\nNakasone continued on, as smarmy as ever, hoping to curry favor with these titans of industry. He flicked through his pre-prepared presentation, until suddenly, the remote clicker stopped working. He coughed again, and laughed nervously as beads of sweat rolled off his face.\n\n"W-well-"\n\nThe snapping turtles, at last, spoke up. "I think I speak for all of us when I say that this proposal is, indeed, intriguing, but it is clear you have no understanding of how such an operation should be completed and what its goals should be. You treat economic reform like a boy wielding his father's gun. We would not like to conduct business with a partner who operates in ignorance of the realities of the market, good day." The old men shoved their papers into their suitcases, and promptly shuffled out. Only one delegate, that of Sumitomo, remained. Sumitomo's delegate walked up to Nakasone, who was, at the moment, sulking in place, and put his hand on Nakasone's shoulder.\n\n"Listen, just between you and me, I hate those old bastards. Let me get Sumitomo in on your deal, alright? The only future they see is one of absolute domination, but I think we both know the path Japan is going down.""

 japtakagirecon.8.d:0 "Takagi, once again, found himself staring down Nakasone as he half-demanded, half-begged for the fulfillment of another one of his proposals. This was getting ridiculous. They sat in the dining car of a train transporting them to one of Takagi's media channels, for Takagi would see to it that his public relations didn't deteriorate following the recent... changes. This was supposed to be a break, where they could relax and eat expensive appetizers. But, as with all things, Nakasone transformed it into work. He kept bringing up his agreements with the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus, and the four pillars of the free market, and so forth. Nakasone would never be satisfied.\n\n"Takagi, listen. Sumitomo and all of the Keiretsus have agreed to our proposal. The market is waiting for us to fulfill our end of the deal. Reforming Japan necessitates the expansion and growth of the free market. And, even if you don't fully agree that liberalization of the economy is a necessity, you must admit that making deals and then dropping them isn't going to bode well for our political relationships."\n\n"You," Takagi states as he points his bony finger towards Nakasone. "You made the deals, not me. You are the one who pushed me into this corner. I don't have time to clean up the messes from your personal adventures, Nakasone!" Takagi breathes in, and restrains his behavior. "Nakasone... I am simply concerned with the policies that you are diving head-first into. Look at Manchukuo, Showa Steel Works and Mantetsu hold absolute domination over the area, and the living conditions are awful, and will stay awful. All I am saying is that you are blindly trusting these corporations out of dedication to the free market. Noble, sure, but very naive."\n\n"That is why we must hurry to liberalize the market. As soon as competition can be introduced, we can prevent the rise of monopolistic enterprises, the likes in Manchukuo... do you follow me, Takagi?"\n\nTakagi sat in silence, looking over the rolling landscape of the Japanese countryside."

A procession of the navy's men marched towards Showa Steel's headquarters, disarming or strong-arming all guards positioned in the facility. The procession, led by a smiling gentlemen in business attire, forcefully entered the headquarters and marched to the office of the head of the facility. What the head operator did not expect was that Yasuhiro Nakasone, the Minister of Finance, was commanding the occupation.\n\nAs nonchalantly as humanly possible, Nakasone entered the office of the head operator, and began giving out orders. This whole operation was unapologetic thuggery acting under the guise of administrative formality.\n\n"Hello, my name is Yasuhiro Nakasone, I expect you to be the head of this facility. I am acting on behalf of a government commission, the goal of which is the prosperity and growth of our nation's free market and entrepreneurial enterprises. I come to you with a... proposal. I am humbly asking you, and the body you work for, to consider the privatization of your facilities." With the word 'privatization,' the navy's men pulled out their pistols and a bundle of papers was then laid on the head operator's desk. The bundle contained within a series of forged entries and reports which attested to the incompetence of the administration of the steelworks.\n\nNakasone then turned to the office window. Looking over the bursts of smog, the heat blasting from the furnaces, the smashing of metal, and the roaring machines, Nakasone felt satisfaction. The might of industry, the delight of mass production. The economist's dream. Looking back to the navy's men, he nodded his head. They shot into the ceiling of the office, which then followed with the cracking of gunshots across the facility.\n\nThe head operator was agape with terror and confusion. Nakasone turned to leave, remarking, "This needs to be done, sir, I hope you can understand. The future is upon us, and I only want to make our transition easier.""

Takagi, stuck in his desk, listening to another one of Nakasone's proposals. Various reports, statistics, graphs, and whatnot were scattered all over the office. Takagi questioned Nakasone's mental integrity. Did Nakasone really think he was going to look over all this data, or did he just want a lot of random statistics to make his argument sound more convincing. Wait, was he doing that the entire time?\n\n"Please, Takagi, pay attention. Essentially, the point of this proposal is a reduction in government spending and bloat across the board. The smaller the government is, the less the next government will be able to undo our reforms, and the less the next government will be able to interfere with the free market."\n\nTakagi truly wondered if Nakasone dreamt of the words 'free market' while sleeping. How many times had those words pierced his ears and burrowed into his skull.\n\n"Now, a key to this proposal is cutting the budget of the army. It is no secret that the army is a reactionary organization that would only undo our reforms if given the chance. Not to mention that the army is consuming unimaginable proportions of our budget already, and as such, we could do with trimming that fat. Government subsidies, too, must be cut. Or, at least the subsidies to unloyal firms. To avoid the publicity hit, I suggest we do it behind the scenes, disguising the cuts as business actions taken on behalf of bad projections. Of course, we should also consider cutting..."\n\nTakagi had heard enough. If this proposal would undermine the army's influence and satisfy Nakasone's lust for a freer market, then it already had more upsides than whatever downsides the rest of the proposal could contain.\n\n"Alright, Nakasone. You may move forward with your proposal, although, ultimately, it isn't my decision whether or not this proposal will pass into law. Do keep in mind, I won't fight your battles for you. You are going to be the one to dance the fandango, this time around. Nakasone, I want to welcome you to the bloodiest battlefield our nation has to offer.""

The whole Diet was and not to be trusted for any longer than it took for the cash in their pocket to burn up.\n\nHe had a plan, however. A plan to rock the lower house, to wield his charm and charisma to command a majority. Takagi would see that he could do it, that he was capable, that he could master the blood court. Stepping onto the central speaking platform, Nakasone unleashed his smile, as bright as he could muster it.\n\n"Hello, I am Yasuhiro Nakasone, for the remainder of this session I will be speaking on behalf of the Sōkichi Takagi government. I have called upon the House of Representatives to discuss the merits, and ultimately approve or deny, a budgetary reform which will, as is included in the folders in front of you all, cut unnecessary bloat throughout the entire government structure."\n\nThe House of Representatives erupted. The reform bureaucrats exploded at the premise of weakening the government and the army especially. In order to counteract the jeers and boos of the reform bureaucrats, Takagi's liberal faction cheered Nakasone on. The Kidoites waited to see what would happen, while the independents crumbled into factions. Ikeda's conservatives, the kingmakers, waited for Ikeda himself to make a decision.\n\nFollowing the wait, Ikeda descended the steps in order to meet with Nakasone. Upon reaching the speaking platform, Ikeda slung his hand on Nakasone's shoulder, and smiled. The House of Representatives transformed into pandemonium on Earth, but eventually, the applause beat out the screams of the decriers.

He wore colorless business attire and expressed all emotion in the boundaries of bureaucratic decorum.

I expect you to present a list of reasonable complaints against my proposal, but, let's be honest, you're going to act like I spat on the Emperor's shoes for merely suggesting the budget be reformed."\n\nKishi got as close as he could to Nakasone. He stared forward, ignoring Nakasone's comments. "Don't act like I don't know what you're doing. You think you can just walk up and sway the Diet by preaching nothing but blind ideology. You have the disposition of an arrogant schoolboy. You need someone to check your ever-expanding ego, and I would be all but too glad to rip apart this proposal, your list of fever dreams, in front of the crowds and cameras. Run off, boy, before you reveal to the nation your idiocy."\n\nThe crowd undulated with excitement, rage and rancor. Screams bursted out from across the mob.

Nakasone made his way down towards the central speaking platform. Kishi and his cronies were already waiting there as Kishi gave a speech in opposition to the proposal. Nakasone could not contain his fury, his bitter resentment. Upon seeing Nakasone, Kishi remarked "Here we see, Nakasone returns. I expect he will want to give a few words, sadly, he already was given the opportunity to give a speech and relinquished it."\n\nNakasone ignored Kishi, and moved to meet him on the speaking platform. "My dear friend, Nobusuke Kishi, has unfortunately, as in many things, overestimated the poignance of his words and the skill inherent to him. My proposal would not, in any dramatic effect, weaken our military capabilities or the effectiveness of our government. The goal is to cut bloat. If you have a meal with a rotten ingredient, removing the ingredient will not weaken the quality of the meal, only improve it."\n\nKishi whispered to Nakasone, "You remain a child in all things, even your metaphors speak of immaturity."\n\nNakasone stared forward. The emotions bubbled from within, but through mental fortitude, he restrained himself. "You know, behind your facade, I would bet you envy youth. In fact, I know you do."\n\nSuddenly, a representative ran into the chamber, shouting for the lower house's attention. The nobles had spoken out in favor of the proposal. All conversations were broken by fierce applause, originating from the liberal faction. Members of the other factions took this opportunity to reconsider their positions in the wake of this... unexpected news."

But... it didn't satisfy him. It wasn't because of Kido sharing the victory, no.

Had Nakasone not been such a vital part of Takagi's government, then he would have certainly not have done this again and again. Having actually scheduled a proper meeting with Takagi, Nakasone was now certain that he could make himself properly heard.\n\n"Prime Minister, I know I have made the point many times before, but I still feel you need to understand why my policies are so vital. It is a matter of the nation's survival."\n\nTakagi had little to offer his finance minister than a nod, signalling him to continue his business pitch"\n\n"The world economy is headed towards a cataclysm, but it can be avoided if we take the proper steps. If we do not wish to be swept away, then I implore you to allow the economy to be properly liberalized. The current half-measures will not see us through the coming years. Set the economy free, let competition and innovation flourish!"\n\nNakasone presented his rather dramatic case with great emphasis on the dangers of what he proposed was to come. Takagi could even register that the minister was being quite earnest, despite his hyperbolic delivery. Noting that Nakasone had finally stopped talking, the Prime Minister considered what he had been told. Were he to refuse to liberalize the economy further, then Nakasone would invariably continue to plead his case whenever he got the chance. There was no point in refusing. Perhaps he even had a point.\n\n"Very well, I want you to formulate a plan for this immediately, if it truly is so urgent."\n\nDelighted to have succeeded, Nakasone promised to begin as soon as possible."

Japan has for too long kept itself isolated, and nowhere has this isolation been more extreme than in economic matters. The regulations on exports only serve to strangle our global competitiveness. Pride and conservative economics are holding us back. We must cut away these regulations and allow exports to flow freely from our shores at once. The Three-Hundred Year Tragedy must end!"\n\nThe Finance Minister was pleased to see Takagi listening intently to his proposal, even if his expression had only eased up ever so slightly. The Prime Minister was indeed listening carefully, despite the fact that he could not have cared less about such a minor matter.\n\nThe Finance Minister carried on with his speech, utilising a number of reports he had commissioned to reinforce his argument. To Prime Minister Takagi, the information they contained was at best dull and at worst meaningless. Once he had had enough of the reports, he interrupted Nakasone.

They drank tea and gazed into the chopping waters and dark blue sky, wondering where their youth had disappeared to. Both of the men chattered of their fishing pastimes in the Tokyo Bay, and reminisced of a past that had now been taken from them.\n\nThe men sat there for hours, gazing at the countless freighter ships hauling in thousands of tonnes of shipment in each hour and discussed how this had changed everything. Akito expressed his anger that there was no more space left for fishermen like him, as the great ships would crush his vessel without even noticing. Eizo was silent, and then grunted in agreement; he insisted that it was a great shame that the nation had forgotten its history of small fishing communities. Both of the old men sipped their teas and continued to watch the great stretches of the Pacific waters, occasionally pointing at a bird or another freighter ship charging into the bay.\n\nThey didn't bother bringing any fishing equipment with them, as their cynicism had already judged the government had replaced any desire to support fishing communities with the profits of off-shore fishing operations and using the ports for shipping. In fact, these men were far too old to even climb down to the harbor to fish. They had no choice but to watch the buoys dance in the distant waters and listen to the gusts of ocean winds as prisoners of their old age. Akito and Eizo both grumbled as ships continued to sail in and dock in Tokyo's harbors, but they knew their age had eclipsed anything they could do to bring them back out to sea."

Today, he was especially interested in the Middle East. While politically dominated by the Italians, much of the region was open to trade and investment by foreign companies. However, very few companies had actually taken the opportunity to do just that. This was a fine chance for Japan to step in.\n\nThe Middle East was free of many restrictions and protections that Nakasone considered a great pain for businesses in Japan. With just a foot in the door, the Keiretsu and Zaibatsu would be free to operate at their peak of their potential efficiency. While this would initially provide Japan with merely more cheap labour, the Middle East was in truth offering much more. Precious resources, such as oil, were just waiting beneath the surface to be extracted. Best of all, it could be done without time being wasted on petty regulations and worries about fair deals with local populations. Japan could soon have itself a gigantic stockpile of oil that it so desperately needed, all to be had at a fine price.\n\nRealising that such an idea was best put into motion without a moment of delay, he began to search through his book of contacts for just the right people to call. Once they were made to be in the know, the wheels of great profits would once again begin spinning at an incredible rate. The Finance Minister could not help but smile at his own plan."

Another leans back on his wooden stool, his spine against the chipping paint of the wall. They toss polished and tightly wound grenades between their hands, and stare at a wooden table covered in high-tech weaponry between them. This stuff was better than what the government could afford, even. They glanced at each other in an amused confusion. Sure, they had bargained with contacts before, oil and intel in exchange for guns, bread and butter. This was a little different. All the guns and bullets they usually got were sub-par, to put it lightly. Caked in dust, lots of duds, chips in the metal and, as was normal, some bullets were missing here or there.\n\nThis, now this was manna from heaven. It was only right for them to begin wondering, who was the contact? The one on the sofa spoke up first.\n\n"You think it could be the Italians? Yeah, the government is bending over backwards for them, but maybe they're getting suspicious. Using us as probes or something, to see if the government is lying about the output."\n\nThe other glanced at him, his complexion one of bemusement. "Fuck, no. If the Italians wanted to know if the government was lying, they could just pull some strings. Everyone follows their beck and call anyway. They don't need us to do it for them.

They're asking us to raid a government-owned oil refinery next week, it's high-security high-risk, but with this, I think we could pull it off."\n\nFollowing that, they each returned to their bored meanderings, content with what they didn't know."

The actors twirled and flew across the stage, bringing a serene calm to the Prime Minister as he could soak up these artistic pleasures as a break from his administrative duties. The same could not be said for Nakasone, as he constantly wriggled around his chair and critiqued every feature he could in a naive attempt to impress Takagi.\n\nJust as a period of silence fell over the two and the Prime Minister could return his attention to the actors, Nakasone pointed out the symbols of wealth the actors bore and began to mumble about complex economic systems and taxation across the Empire. Tired of returning banal platitudes, Takagi turned his head to gaze at Nakasone with an empty expression. Only encouraging the man, Nakasone pulled out a handkerchief and scribbled a rough graph in a weak black ink. Takagi, lost for words at how inappropriate Nakasone's incessant ramblings were, could only pick up the words 'Rolle's theorem' from the distorted whispers distracting him from the drum of the Tsuzumi. The scribbled handkerchief was placed on the Prime Minister's arm rest as Nakasone continued to babble over intricacies of taxation levels across Japan, seemingly unaware the Kabuki theater was still airing a performance. Embarrassed by Nakasone's ignorance of his surroundings, and as the stringing of the Shamisen grew more intense, Takagi grabbed the handkerchief and leaned over to Nakasone, interrupting him with an dry and low grumble:\n\n"Look, I'll cut taxes and regulations.

After arriving, Kajiwara sat herself down at her workstation and began to sow. To her left was a giant pile of shoe pieces which she was expected to make into footwear by the end of the day. As Kajiwara worked, she would occasionally glance towards the back of the cavernous room. That section of the sweatshop had been turned into a makeshift office for her supervisor, Mr Handa. When he was not enjoying the cool air from the fan upon his desk, Mr Handa would patrol the sweatshop floor. While scanning the workers, he would casually twirl the stick he carried in his right hand, a reminder of just how much power he held in that room.\n\nWork in the oppressively humid climate carried on mostly as normal for Kajiwara. She worked quicker than she might have usually done. She had missed her quota last week, and the thought of repeating that mistake was terrifying. Her grueling shift carried on until just after sunset, and the pile of shoe parts was just about gone. As she was about to finish her work, the stick carried by Handa slammed down on the table, sending the last pieces of leather flying.\n\n"Kajiwara, I just checked the record and I realised you didn't make the quota last week. It doesn't seem like you'll manage it this week either. I think it's time we made an example out of you."\n\nThe sweatshop workers were forcefully beckoned to watch as Handa prepared to strike his employer across the hand with his stick.

The intense buzz in the air formed a thick mist; industrial chemicals seeping from the churns of production appliances were an awful stench filling Nakasone's nose. He covered his face in disgust, and awkwardly smiled back at his company of advisors, before again gazing at the filthy and cramped factory floor.\n\nThe manager of the sweatshop approached the group of men from the railing's stairs and, with a heavy hand, shook Nakasone's hand, greeting him and thanking him for his visit. Nakasone, in the presence of a fellow business-orientated mind, smiled back and chuckled, and began to confess his appreciation of the great output of the manager's industrial facility. Both the men grinned, and began to talk of plans for the state-backed expansion of the plant in a series of programs to develop the economy. Nakasone and the manager talked for a long while, until the exhausted workers around the factory seemed more interested in the government visit than in their laborious work.\n\nNoticing and signalling a colleague, the manager ordered the workers back to their stations in a blustering scream, and the fatigued operators were hurried back to their buzzing machines. Yelling and shrieking followed, causing a small ruckus before being dissipated by other members of staff dragging workers away to be punished. To Nakasone and his party of advisors, this was a great display of modern industrial discipline and they began to applaud the manager's skill.

Japan's ramparts against progress and change were broken with the arrival of the Western World. The imperialists, originating from the West, took it upon themselves to form pseudo-colonies out of China and Japan, economic slaves for their mercantile greed. China was made a drug-addicted shell of its former self, the West claiming entire cities for themselves, and carving it into spheres of influence. Japan would not fall to that fate.\n\nThe arrival of the West was a necessary baptism of fire, for it taught Japan what they needed to do to survive in this world of the strong and weak. Undergoing an industrial revolution in a few decades, Japan was determined to make itself into a regional power. Prepared to expand and feed Japan's burgeoning industry, the governments of Japan went on adventures of conquest, from Taiwan to Korea, Manchuria to Micronesia. The Konoe and Tojo governments formed our modern Japan, from the dominance of the Zaibatsus and the Keiretsus, to masterhood over Asia.\n\nWith triumph, Japan rested complacent with its conquests, and with complacence, Japan's industry has stagnated and declined. The Zaibatsus and Keiretsus are only interested in lands abroad, from Guangdong to China to Vietnam. Without reason to develop the Home Islands, they have abandoned our nation to its current state of industry, dating back to the 1930s. With the economically liberalizing reforms of Minister of Finance Nakasone, this slide into the abyss has been counteracted. Fresh and productive industrial plants have popped up throughout Japan's cities. Pustules of industry have appeared across the face of our nation, and are only expanding.

This would be his night to celebrate how far he had come. In his time as Minister of Finance, Japan had entered into a period of economic liberalization beyond his wildest dreams as a political flunkie, only a few years ago. The night air was frigid and gnawed at his skin, but it could not overpower his delight. Looking over the Tokyo skyline, Nakasone saw something so magnificent he could hardly contain his awe. Where once Tokyo was a city of poor fisherman and the scattered nobleman, it was now a city of lights. Bright yellows originating from the industrial plants, neon reds and blues from the advertisements and signs, and a single, piercing green light from across the bayside.

After laughing and chuckling for hours before, the conversation suddenly became very somber and gloomy as Takagi began to speak of his troubled childhood in the quiet of the night sky that stretched above them:\n\n"I remember going to bed some nights hungry. I remember my education consisting of learning how to read and write in a brick room. We had chalkboards to write words, and we were beaten for thinking anything above and beyond what our teacher wanted. It was no way for a child to live. I don't want that for the children of today."\n\nThe Prime Minister continued to speak of his poor upbringing and education, but was not overwhelmed by emotion. Instead, he was rather cold and bitter, seemingly uncaring of the past he no longer lived in. Nakasone, interpreting this as an opportunity to weigh in, compared his childhood to Takagi's; he smirked and spoke of the silly stories and memories he had with friends. He mumbled about learning French in his adolescence and reading the Aeneid, forgetting all but a few words from each, and poking the Prime Minister as he recalled childhood stories of classroom pranks in his peaceful, idyllic youth.\n\nNakasone took a gulp of champagne, knocking his head back as he swallowed, before returning his vision to the Prime Minister. Takagi was silent, nodding his head - brushing his nose before glancing back at Nakasone and half-smiling with a mix of envy and resentment."

With his backpack hanging from his small shoulders, he swung open the door and ran to his mother, who was finely preparing Rui-be for her husband, and embraced her before dashing to the table. The boy hurled open his backpack, drawing sheets of paper and pencils and spreading them across the table before scurrying over to grab a jar of pennies from beneath his father.\n\nThe boy's mother called to him whilst paying attention to her meal, not quite understanding her son's dexterity to his homework, but impressed at his new-found studious attitude towards his work. Language, she assumed, as her son had been piecing together his understanding of the complexities of Kanji characters. As she brought over the wooden bowl of seafood to her husband, she peered down to see the boy's work and gasped - numbers! Small columns and tables were sprawled across the boy's sheets of paper as he used the pennies to count, with answers to simple problems scribbled in pencil lead beneath symbols of multiplication and division. She called over her husband, who in turn hurried over to examine the papers and observe his son.\n\nHe flicked through the papers; each creased sheet reading 'Science' or 'Mathematics', reading with basic problems or chemical formulas with diagrams printed onto them. The boy's father scratched his head and gazed down at him, smiling and clearly proud. Both parents were amazed that even their boy, who lived in rural Hokkaido, was educated with the standard expected children in the southern islands. Now sitting at the table with his son, the boy's father gazed in absolute awe as he continued to jot down his answers in the homework."

The Finance Minister therefore asked that Takagi inform him of his idea.\n\n"As we have recently invested into education, I thought it might also be pertinent to make some investments into scientific research. I am aware of several institutes that have recently made requests for more government funding.\n\n"I see, Prime Minister. Do you believe that the economy can benefit from such measures?"\n\nNakasone was already quite aware of a few ways that the economy could gain from government investments in science. The question he posed was merely a way to understand Takagi's own reasoning.\n\n"Giving grant money to deserving scientists could greatly speed up the pace at which new technologies enter the market. The corporations are sure to then fund anything of value at that point, which will make said products more economically viable to the general population.\n\n"You have clearly thought this proposal through, sir. I think it sounds like a fine idea. However, you should carefully consider your options when it comes to handing out the grants. Our budget should not be wasted on dead-end research."\n\nWishing to attend to some intricate matter, Naksone excused himself with a polite bow. The Prime Minister was somewhat surprised that his suggestion had gone down so well. He had been expecting the finance minister to either explain to him the intricate details of how to implement a better plan or even dismiss the idea as nonesone. Perhaps he had in fact learned a thing or two from Nakasone, which was something Takagi had never expected himself to do."

Twelve scientists headed out to enjoy the night. And found themselves at the large corner table they usually occupied in their favourite bar. Before the mood became too jovial and a few of them became a bit too tipsy to hold a complex conservation, one of their number spoke up\n\nI'd just like to say a few words before we begin drinking."\n\n"Oh come on Horiuchi! Can't we start and then you can talk?"\n\n"Let him speak, Okita. I think we all want to hear him speak"\n\nAs the group's unofficial leader, Yoneda's defence of Horiuchi was met with immediate agreement. Okita even apologized for his over-eagerness.\n\n"Thanks Yoneda. I'd just like to say that we've been really lucky this past week. Funding has been tight for mobile communication across the country. A few projects even got shut down in Osaka from what I've heard. So that grant we got really saved our backsides!\n\nA murmur of approval emitted from the scientists as well as a few chuckles. Horiuchi was not one to usually use a word like "backside".\n\n"It's good to know someone cares about what we're trying to do in the lab. I mean, everyone will eventually thank us when their radios and phones shrink a few sizes, but someone has to have faith in us now as well! Let's all raise a toast to the future, to innovation, to the help we're getting and most of all, to us!"\n\n"To the future, to innovation, to the help we're getting and to us!"

The warm palette of colors illuminated the park with great displays of flowers and plants. Enthralling botanical exhibits caught both the men's eyes as they strolled through the gardens, discussing policy and administration. Fields of green were speckled with the pink and blue petals of flowers freckling the freshly cut grass, and a light breeze brushed fresh air through the crimson leaves of the Japanese maple that hung over the path in which the men walked. They were immersed in a lush and palatial garden, calmed by the charms of the earthly paradise.\n\nThe Prime Minister and his accomplice approached the pond to feed ducks, throwing small handfuls of feed on the water surface. Another soft breeze blew through the gardens, and the whoosh of leaves brought a heavenly calm to Takagi. For Nakasone, however, he was overcome with an overwhelming anxiety. Turning to Takagi, he expressed his worries that he had not done enough during his time as Minister of Finance, and accused himself of failure before sinking his head in shame.\n\nTakagi, as stoic and serene as ever, grabbed Nakasone by the shoulders and patted him on the back, assuring him that he had nothing to worry about. Nakasone peered up at the Prime Minister, noticing again the serene gardens that surrounded them both. He saw the small birds singing and dashing through the air; he saw the sea of vibrant flowers waving in the light breeze; he saw the white and peaceful clouds rest in the deep blue sky. Nakasone inhaled a deep breath of the cool, refreshing air, before returning his attention back to a friendly and fraternal Takagi who had found a unique peace in the spring gardens the two had explored."

From the start, it was going to be another slog through budget discussions and arguments over what type of reform they should be fighting for. Economic liberalization, as Nakasone and Tadashi always argued for, would be pitted against whatever reform plan had taken up Zenjiro's interest. He would side with Zenjiro, there would be some arguments, and ultimately they would forge a compromise so that Japan could continue to progress. This procedure had become so commonplace that they would sometimes skip straight to the compromise segment.\n\nTakagi took his seat, rubbed his eyes, and shuffled the weekly reports until he could see the recent news going about. But... something was off. The cabinet had been unusually silent as he was entering, rather than their typical rowdiness. Zenjiro was leaning forward, prepared to speak. Strange. Zenjiro wasn't the type to jump into arguments. And, for some ungodly reason, Kido was missing. Upon making himself comfortable, Takagi motioned for Zenjiro to speak his thoughts.\n\n"Takagi, our intelligence has been noting something. The youth has, for reasons yet unknown, been experiencing an uptick in anti-government behavior. Now, that isn't abnormal, but the rate and scale of this all is... bewildering. Across the Home Islands, local governments are reporting vandalism and disobedience en masse. Nothing has been concluded, but we suspect that our lack of social reform may have something to do with it. They want us to act, is the working theory."\n\nNakasone banged his fist against the table. He leaned forward, placing his other hand underneath his chin. "We're reformers, not puppets of the mob, especially when the mob consists of children. Let the anger boil over. They always do this, get frustrated over the little things and then explode in a temper tantrum when they aren't given what they want. I... know- look, let's just move onto the important things." Takagi took a moment to contemplate. This wasn't going to work. They were going to have to accede to something, some form of social reform. Takagi looked back towards Nakasone."

It had only taken a few days, and in that time, a typhoon of the mind crashed upon Japanese society, or more accurately a caste of the Japanese social hierarchy. The name had not yet pierced the ears of Prime Minister Takagi or Minister of Finance of Nakasone, but the young, radical, poor, and exiled heard it and it only. It repeated over and over again, in whispers and thoughts. It burned itself into the consciousness of the lower class, and with every repetition, a flame of rage and injustice was fueled. Kato. Kato. Kato.\n\nShidzue Kato was a self-made woman, a wily and cunning operator of the Japanese blood court. Even without political office she has fought for the feminist cause, from reproductive rights to the destruction of gender norms entrenched in Japanese society. She came so close to the greatest goal a woman can aspire to, a political position in the government. But her efforts failed. A single woman cannot beat the society and culture of millions, her critics said. So she made her next goal to beat the society and culture of millions. Her autobiography has been released, detailing her progress so far and the regressive injustice of the systems she fights. It didn't take long for the work to be banned, but it also doesn't take much looking around to see that banning the book hasn't stopped its movement. Even as an underground publication, it is a best-seller and can be found hidden in backpacks, secluded corners, and store-rooms across the nation. The work has started widespread albeit small protests, all of them fighting for Kato's largest and most ambitious goal, the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho, the National Eugenics Law, which has cemented eugenics, restriction of birth control access, and the sterilization of 'inferiors' as government policy since the 40s."

Once dusk arrived and all the park goers had long since left, a few dregs of the crowds came out from the woodworks and assembled underneath the bridge. Other groups, arriving in beat-up cars and the last buses of the night, joined their peers below the bridge. More and more came forward, springing outwards from the nearby slums and alleyways. Students. They spread red paint and ribbons between themselves, emulating the socialist revolutionaries and communist freedom fighters of yore. A few select firebrands dragged out soapboxes, park benches and lunch tables, prepared to extol the righteousness of their mission. Others lit alight barrels filled with brush, the chilly wind gnawing at their skin. One of the leaders of the students' unions, a proverbial veteran of the movement, got up to speak, and with him the mob silenced itself.\n\n"You all know what we're here to discuss. Kato. Now, I know some of you think this is our opportunity to spring forward, to make our presence known and get the government working for true progress. Yes, this is our moment, but I ask of you all, we must wait a little longer. This is a spark, but the flame has not yet been struck. Of course, this is injustice. The government is out there, murdering innocents in the name of 'racial hygiene' and preventing the oppressed from stopping their oppression. That said, a woman getting denied a political position isn't what we need, it isn't powerful enough. We want progress? Blood has to be shed. The moment blood runs in the gutters, and you know they'll take the first chance they can to kill a kid, we riot. You hear? We riot, and they'll have to listen!"\n\nThe mob began to slam their fists against their chests. With two fingers, they stroked red paint across their cheeks.

Now she remembered the awkward comments made by her mother whenever she stepped out of her bounds and what the government spewed from its outlets about the roles of girls and boys. Indoctrination was what it was. Looking up from the autobiography, she formed a wily smile. It didn't work. The years of propaganda had failed, because she was here, realizing that it was what it was, indoctrination.\n\nSuddenly, upon entering a suburban courtyard of her district, she couldn't feel her foot reach the ground. She glanced down, only to find the cold, hard concrete floor of the courtyard meeting her face. She could tell, even in her position, it was another goddamn pothole she had just tripped in. Kato's autobiography slipped from her fingers in the panic, and in its flight, the false cover she had been using to hide the book's identity flew from the autobiography's confines. The book slid away, far from her grasp. A local policeman, noticing what had happened, began to run over. Dizzily, she attempted to snatch Kato's autobiography, but she wasn't quick enough. The policeman, noticing the cover of the book, stopped his running.\n\nShe steadied herself, but upon looking back towards the policeman, all she could sense was pain and blunt force. A bone, she couldn't tell which, cracked, and with it blood sprayed onto the concrete. The policeman, wielding a wooden truncheon, again smashed his club into her forehead. She winced and grabbed at her eye. Through her fingers, a torrent of blood washed onto the floor. She attempted to cry, but the pain of doing so forced her to collapse onto the ground. He kept beating into the convulsing body of the woman until she lay mangled and bloodied in the center of the courtyard. A few passersby desperately attempted to hold him back, but to no avail. Most stayed at arm's length, content to stare instead of intervene. By the end, she was dragged away, handcuffs locked onto her disfigured wrists."

The beating and mutilation of an innocent woman just for carrying around the wrong book was the limit of their patience, however. They kicked at the walls, preparing their feet for the real thing.

All of that had changed once a single word had stormed through their minds and ink, Kato. With Kato, they were at last able to see the injustice that surrounded them, and with knowledge, they could fight that injustice. This generation was not unified, however. Although all followed Kato, they varied from reformers to revolutionaries. One question lingered in the minds of those who wanted change: how do we make the government listen? Protests, riots, terror? No matter, things had to change somehow, and they would be the ones to bring it about. News was going around that universities across the nation were all staging incidents to force the government's hand. Keio was special, in that regard. Its students were those uplifted from the lower class, the next generation of parvenus. The student body itched at the trigger, prepared to take extreme action to bring about Kato's vision.\n\nThe bell rang, and so the students dragged out backpacks, purses and packages. What emerged was weaponry, make-shift batons and bludgeons, even the occasional pistol. They stormed the halls, breaking through into the general offices of the university. The teachers took their chance to evacuate, and in their absence the PA systems were left open for use in the student's mission. A grainy, blaring voice spread their message throughout the halls, classrooms and dormitories of the university. "Spread the word, the next generation has taken command of Keio University. Our demands are simple, and the living conditions we ask for are matched across the world. First, a repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho. We are not barbarians who freely murder our own citizens over their skills and abilities. Secondly, the government must answer for the beating and maiming of all those, across the nation, who have done nothing but read the works of Shidzue Kato. Kato's autobiography should be unbanned, and the government should rein in the police force. Such acts are crimes against morality.

 japtakagirecon.47.d:0 "Sweat rolled off of Takagi's chin as he approached the door to the boardroom. Another cabinet meeting, yes, but this occasion was anything but usual. He was sloppily dressed, his suit hanging loosely on his body. A stream of papers leaked from his briefcase with every shamble of his legs. Something had happened, and he would have to take the fall. It was never meant to come to this; Takagi did not want anyone dead from these antics. Yet, people were dying. Not just those students, but every infant killed due to the Kokumin Yuseiho. Some would say Takagi was buying into the propaganda, but he couldn't ignore the reality of sterilization and extermination which pervaded the Japanese system. He was supposed to be a liberal, a reformer. What had happened...?\n\nTakagi pushed into the boardroom, exhausted after the long night of scheduling and fuming at the notion that students had died under his administration. It was an unusual sort of anger for Takagi. He was never a furious or vindictive man. He took his anger out in controlled bursts of frustration, always in the form of pragmatic analyses turned attacks. He could be hostile, yes, but never openly enraged. This day would be different. This day, Takagi was explosive.\n\n"Nakasone. What have you done? There are students, children, dead on the floor of Keio University because of your actions, your propositions! Why... Why could we not have negotiated? Why did you have to suggest we crack down, we beat down children? You act like lives and people are nothing. I truly wonder, Nakasone. Why do you do what you do? Is there any reason you oppose a repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho? From the looks of it, you mindlessly put your faith in systems which are killing people. Killing people, Nakasone! We're killing people, don't you realize! Every day, there is blood on my hands..."\n\nTakagi placed his head between his hands. Nakasone glanced around, confused at what he had ever 'suggested.'"

 japtakagirecon.48.d:0 "The wind howled and dew slipped from the pink leaves of the cherry blossom trees. Takagi walked, with slow, heavy steps, towards the memorial site of those two students killed during the seizure of Keio University. He wasn't lying when he said he had never meant for any of this. He was, too, a student with radical dreams once. He thought he could transform the navy from the inside into a liberalized, less militaristic organization. He had succeeded, but these children had not. Frustrated by an oppressive system, they rebelled. They lost, of course, in the most tragic of ways. Takagi shed a few tears as he looked over their cobblestone plaques. The fog and humid mist of the horizon was all that would welcome his sadness.\n\nA few camera flashes and forlorn questions thrown pitifully against his back greeted his return to the reality of Japan and its politics. Some straggler journalists had followed him here, so it seemed. Even in the abyss of the mind, he could not attain privacy. Takagi turned to the journalists, prepared to make an announcement.\n\n"To all of those who may be listening in, I would like to make a promise. The deaths of these students, dark though it may seem, were acts of martyrdom for a righteous cause, and I will see to it that their cause does not die before justice is done. This situation will be handled appropriately. It has been my resolve, ever since the beginning of my premiership, to see to it that the innocent and good-willed do not experience pain for nothing. I cannot undo their deaths, but I will fight for their legacies."\n\nThe rains were picking up again, and with their arrival Takagi made his leave. He bowed his head, the cameras flashing the entire way, and left the memorial site. The journalists screamed and begged for answers to their questions, for any more pieces of information. Takagi ignored their calls, instead choosing to leave these deaths as they were: a call for action."

 japtakagirecon.49.d:0 "Takagi scoffed over some reports on his desk until an article was thrown in front of him by Deputy Prime Minister Kido. It read 'To the Takagi Administration' and was authored by a certain Shidzue Kato. Takagi fell back in his chair with a great sigh. He threw away the reports and began to scan through the article and its defaming content, trying not to become overwhelmed with fury from the scrap of political dissent.\n\nThe article decried the 'horrible abuses of the Takagi government' as brutal and barbaric, branding the Prime Minister as 'not worthy of Japan.' Takagi smirked, skeptical of Kato's sanity, and continued flicking through the article's claims. He came across phrases such as 'treasonous against the freedom of humanity' and 'a misogyny amplified to imperial standards', and chuckled harder at the outrageousness of their claims.\n\nAfter reading some of the terms to Kido, the Prime Minister found Kato's section on the recent student protests. She remained ambiguous over her support of the student protests, but noted that the more Takagi's police used violence, the more violent the students would grow. Takagi, lost for words, read this over many times. The students grew louder and louder each day, motivated by their resistance against law enforcement. He had already thought it, already seen it. Now, the public was seeing it too, and this worried him greatly."

 japtakagirecon.50.t:0 "The Public Discontent Grows"
 japtakagirecon.50.d:0 "The Prime Minister was informed of a great march in the streets of Tokyo. Consisting of thousands of people, women's groups and student activists congregate in the streets of the capital to join the protests born from Keio University's student unrest. Bearing hundreds of signs and placards, the protesters call for an end to the Kokumin Yuseiho as well as various pieces of Tojo-era wartime legislation. They marched towards the Diet, chanting cries of reform like a vast swarm of wasps. The mass gathering of protesters buzzed through the city, frothing at the mouth in search for anyone to hold accountable.\n\nTakagi sat with his cabinet in his office, the crowds only a few streets away. Law enforcement redirected the masses of people, but the Prime Minister knew they'd eventually reach his building. He tapped his finger repeatedly on his desk; his eyes fixated on the air in front of him as he thought about what to do. The room was sweating with a bothered worry, until Foreign Minister Kuranari Tadashi groaned and yelled, "We have to do something. These are radicals, Prime Minister! Who knows what they will do if we let their grubby hands near our legislature. Look outside - it's treason!"\n\nTakagi glanced at the irritated man before returning his vision to the thin air. He was still and silent, but sweating profusely. The faint roar of the protests grew louder and louder as the march continued, with law enforcement regrouping closer to the cabinet's office. Behind them, they had left destruction in their path, litter across the streets and windows smashed near outbreaks of violence. Clashes with law enforcement became more frequent, now visible from the windows of Takagi's offices. He peered from behind a curtain and turned back to his cabinet, all eager to hear his next move. Takagi's lips began to tremble as he announced orders to contain the protest beyond the building's doors."

Once they considered his previous suggestions to solve the situation at hand, neither minister was too surprised that he was now absent. Once everyone had taken their seats, Prime Minister Takagi began to summarize recent developments since their last meeting.\n\n"Since our last security meeting, the situation with the students has only grown to great heights. More protests have broken out, and the students have shown no sign of being willing to back down. There is a growing possibility that failure to handle this matter will shift public opinion away from us. That is not something I can tolerate happening.\n\nUnlike the last time, the cabinet ministers were less eager to voice their opinions. Hasty dismissal of the protests had only caused more problems. Eventually, it was Koichi Kido who broke the uneasy silence.\n\n"A more careful and prolonged application of force will solve this. Once the students release that their actions will only be met with force, they will return to their classes."\n\nHorikiri was the next to speak\n\n" I disagree. If we meet them with force, they will only become more emboldened and radical. Let us attempt negotiations again. Once someone reminds of how reforms are actually made, they will give in."\n\nBefore any sort of argument between his two ministers could begin, Takagi held up a hand to quiet them. The Prime Minister considered his options in silence for a moment. He had his two options, now he had to choose one. After another few moments, Takagi had reached his conclusion."

It had been a good few years since his days at Tokyo Imperial University, and even those buildings had been rebuilt forty years ago. Much had changed since those days. When Prime Minister Takagi had appointed him to meet with the protesting students, Horikiri had gladly accepted. The Home Minister had little faith in their commitments to the protests and was sure that they would back down upon hearing him speak.\n\nThe Home Minister was led to a stage in the university's main hall, where he was greeted by the sight of several hundreds students. "I stand before you today as an emissary of the Prime Minister. He has asked me to explain the circumstances regarding the commission to you. "\n\nA murmur began to spread around the crowd, which Horikiri allowed to simmer for a moment before continuing.\n\n"The commission is engaged in matters of great importance to the nation. It must be allowed to operate underdisturbed those not educated to speak on matters such as the Kokumin Yusheiho. The Prime Minister asks that you remain peaceful and civ-"\n\nBefore Horikiri could finish his sentence, he was cut off by a voice in the crowd. "Why should we not be allowed to participate? We ask only to be included in matters that shape our future, that we feel strongly about. The government will have to put up with us until our demands are met!" The student was met with applause from his fellows.\n\n"Your concerns have been noted, but the decisions concerning your involvement have already been made. You must accept this." Horikiri seemed to only embolden the students further each time he refused their demands. Each voice in the crowd was received with great praise, while he was met with silence. Eventually he was met with no choice but to offer them his word that he would once again bring their demands before the government. He only hoped that a small victory would not give them the taste for even more change."

 japtakagirecon.53.d:0 "In the Prime Minister's office, Takagi and Kido had sat staring at each other in silence. The Prime Minister was tired and apprehensive; he sighed in his chair and threw himself forward to lean over from behind his desk. Kido, welcoming this interaction, was seemingly unaware of the desperate fatigue smeared over Takagi's face and simply wished to hear the Prime Minister's offer. Takagi sighed again and threw a pen across his desk to initiate the potentially exhausting interaction.\n\n"Kido, you and I are in some trouble if we don't act soon. Kishi is up to something, and if he plays his cards right we may be outnumbered in the Diet. You know exactly where we will end up if we let this happen." Kido adjusted the glasses that sat on his nose, and he nodded whilst listening to the Prime Minister's request. Thoroughly impressed, Kido brandished a grin and spoke with a fresh optimism, approving of Takagi's request. He began to blabber about who he will ring and speak to, and with each breath he took Takagi failed to interrupt him. Unbenounced to Kido, the Prime Minister's fury bubbled up with each word he uttered.\n\nA civil servant burst through the office door carrying sheets of paper for the Prime Minister, and Takagi's fiery, piercing gaze melted him. The servant retreated in second, and Tagaki returned his furious attention to an intimidated Kido who had curled up in his chair. Taking a breath and keeping his cool, he spoke to Kido with a slower yet firm tone: "I don't think you understand. We will be out of here in weeks if you and I don't get things done." Kido gulped, having never seen Takagi this vexed before, and shook his hand before discussing things further."

They strolled through the green gardens and caught up about personal affairs, approaching a wooden bench to sit and watch the birds while discussing various events across the globe. The two men nodded and agreed with one another on multiple issues and chuckled about others, usually pausing with a brief and awkward silence between each sentence.\n\nSuddenly, Kishi turned to the Prime Minister and gave him a stern look. "I know who you are talking to," he said, bluntly, "the student leaders. It's becoming more obvious." Takagi's eyes widened and his mouth went dry, but he did not let any sign of weakness show. He turned his head towards Kishi with a look of disapproval, pressuring him to apologize for his deceitful claims. Kishi, unbothered by the Prime Minister's appearance, smirked silently, before pulling a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his nose. He looked back towards the serene gardens for a moment, then uttered to Takagi: "Don't try to hide it from me," provoking the Prime Minister further.\n\n"Mr. Kishi, I hope you're not planning anything malevolent," remarked Takagi, prying for more information from his acquaintance.\n\nKishi replied after a moment, gazing into the garden's graceful fountains. "Mr. Prime Minister, what I think remains with me as a law-abiding citizen. All I say is to be careful what you bring up in the Diet; the protests are closely watched, but you are watched more so.""

It was late, and they had both stood in front of the great panel of glass, peering out over Tokyo's evening skyline through the trickles of raindrops smeared over the window. The rain pattered and tapped on the glass; it was a calming and musical experience that distracted Zenjiro from his recently far more stressful role. After clearing his throat, the Prime Minister began speaking to him, slowly and softly enough that the rain was still very much audible.\n\n"We can't let this keep happening. It will be chaos out there," Takagi paused, before speaking again, "You and I both know this ends one way... I want the Tokko at work tomorrow morning."\n\nZenjiro turned to Takagi with a disapproving scowl, protesting the Prime Minister's request. He insisted it was far beyond what was necessary for the students; it was inessential to be so draconian, yet all of his pleas were met with a solemn frown from Takagi. Zenjiro darted his head back to the window and was silent for a moment. He peered out over the city and at the great marvels the empire had built in the last fifty years. He gulped, knowing the Prime Minister was right to combat the protests, and began to speak slowly to Takagi, "And... what do you want to be done?"\n\nThe Prime Minister, now a few feet away and sitting behind his desk, began to list operations and times for meetings to coordinate the use of the Tokko with the rest of his cabinet. Zenjiro, knowing what was right, agreed and then bowed before leaving the Prime Minister's office.

Carrying a slim briefcase, Takagi turned back and greeted the two men with a confused frown, shaking their hands firmly. Usually, these men would heckle and jeer at his government in the chamber, harassing his legislative attempts with all kinds of vetoes and ideological opposition. It confused the Prime Minister to see his adversaries greet him so familiarly.\n\nKishi and Ikeda grinned throughout the entire interaction with a smug aura about them, chuckling and smirking with the Prime Minister. They congratulated him for his 'bravery' to 'deal with' the students with appropriate law enforcement and security measures. "Brave, a man such as yourself fighting back," Ikeda snickered, wiping his nose as he gagged on his own laughs. The Prime Minister was unimpressed, keeping a straight face. In what felt like a backhanded compliment, Kishi noted he especially admired the retaliation of riot police fighting back at radicals in the crowd, possibly alluring and humoring Takagi's pacifism relative to their dexterity to call for repression.\n\nTakagi shook their hands once more, thanking them for their presence, and left to return to his estate, unsure of the true intentions of the interaction. As Takagi stepped into his car and the chauffeur closed the door behind him, Kishi and Ikeda waved at him from the steps of the Diet.

Takagi dashed some of the flyers in front of him and fell back in his chair, rocking forward and back in an attempt to keep himself calm.\n\nKido, sifting through sheets and sheets of paper, took off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. He cleared his throat, and spoke to the Prime Minister: "They're all saying the same thing. They want incomprehensible and revolutionary change." A deafening silence followed, only broken by the sound of creasing paper and the occasional sigh of a minister. Nakasone, with tired eyes and sweat clinging to the inside of his suit, groaned to Takagi, noting that their demands were outrageous and could never be satisfied. Takagi raised his brow, acknowledging the irrationality of the radicals put things in his favor, but he was not comforted to be in such a precarious position.\n\nThe cabinet stayed in the boardroom into the late hours of the night, eventually stripping down their overcoats and blazers to work with rolled-up sleeves and loosened ties. As the clock struck two in the morning, they had come to a consensus. The men gazed at the piles and piles of pages they had gone through and noted the core ofwhat the protesters demanded - fix the economy and repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho.

As he merrily approached Zunjiro, the security minister scowled and muttered: "What makes you so bloody zany?", dimming Nakasone's mood and reducing him to a quiet shell of his cheerful self.\n\nKido, sprawled out on a leather chair, sat back and engaged with Takagi in discussing any possible outcome of future efforts to legislate and ignore the agenda of the protesters. The Prime Minister chuckled, cynical of the Diet's attention to detail, and shook his head. Kido nodded, understanding of Takagi's pains and began to involve Nakasone and Tadashi in the discussions between the five of them. Soon after, a buzz disrupted the music on the radio, and Nakasone dragged himself from his seat to turn it off.\n\nAt the very last moment, Takagi whipped his head around and demanded Nakasone turn the volume up. The five sat there and listened, not quite knowing what to expect, and all of them leapt from their positions upon hearing the news - a huge protest with thousands of attendees had gathered in the Tokyo suburbs, sounding more radical than before. The Prime Minister's eyes widened as he looked back to Kido, and Nakasone's head fell into his hands. Calling for Zenjiro to get a hold of the head of Tokyo's law enforcement, a cold sweat climbed up Takagi's back as his face grew red with worry."

Takagi was starving, and any food would be good enough to get him thinking straight again. The three made the occasional comment about their lunch as they chewed through the expensive delicacies, until Takagi began to make a point of his position as Prime Minister.\n\nKido and Zenjiro listened diligently to Takagi, who sat explaining his dilemmas to the two whilst eating his sea urchin and fresh salmon. He debated about putting an end to the protests once and for all, much to Zenjiro's surprise, and asked if suppression would drown out the radical cries. Talking of police raids and mass arrests, the Prime Minister risked jeopardizing his entire support base in his impassioned ramblings. Zenjiro stopped eating and listened very carefully to him, momentarily glancing over at Kido who was lost for words at the sheer nature of Takagi's argument.\n\nAfter taking a sip of water, Takagi then continued to contemplate - now wondering if he should simply invite Kato over for an honest discussion. The Prime Minister looked towards Kido whilst rambling, and Zenjiro attempted to hold back a snicker. Kido kicked him from under the table, and continued to pay attention to a reflecting Takagi. He nodded and returned one-word replies to the Prime Minister, attempting to hide his hesitance under a blanket of cool approval.

I am sure you have seen and heard much of the student movement that has taken the streets these past few months. I am so very happy to see young people here stand up for themselves and fight back. Such a movement for genuine reform has been long coming in this country. I cannot say I agree with all their demands, but I suppose I am somewhat older than them! I hope this does not undermine their hard work, as I fear the older generations will not be so radical as they are... My public support for these students has had some unexpected consequences. It seems that I have ended up becoming some of a figurehead for this movement, despite my hesitations. While it has been good to provide them with this support, I must say the attention from the political establishment is becoming uncomfortable.\n\nThe Prime Minister has recently expressed interest in meeting with me and I am deeply unsure as to what I must do. He speaks of negotiation and compromise, but I wonder if that is truly what he, or those he represents wants. Agreeing to meet with him, even if it does illicit a workable compromise, might push me further into the limelight. I don't want to suffer through another arrest like I did all those years ago.\n\nAs you can see, I need your aid. You know how to deal with politicians and bureaucrats, you've stood against the YSK for years and called for reforms all the while. What do you do in situations like this?

 japtakagirecon.62.d:0 "It has been over thirty years since the implementation of the now deeply controversial Kukumin Yuseiho. Since then, it has been used to suppress the rights of women, while masking itself in a guise of protecting the population from genetic disease. Failure on the part of the government to address this long-standing issue has caused numerous problems over the decades. While Prime Minister Takagi has recently opened a commission to "re-examine" the kokumin yuseiho, it is doubtful that much will change through this process. What is clear, is that the youth of this country are no longer willing to sit by and allow their future to be decided by the older generations. Can we really blame them for protesting the government's sluggish response to the changing times? I do not think so. When a piece of legislation affects around half the population's rights to their own bodies, is it truly so unreasonable that many young people in Japan today wish to see the kokumin Yuseiho go?\n\nIt is narrow-minded to view the student protests as merely a spark of rebelliousness. I believe they demonstrate the will and demands of a much larger section of the population that has been too suppressed, both politically and socially, to speak up prior to now. These are laws that affect the fundamental rights of women and they stand in the face of progress and equality. The activism of the youth in the face of government stubbornness should be seen as an inspiration and a bright hope of future reforms towards a more equal society. The Kokumin Yuseiho must now be repealed and replaced with something more fitting with the times we live in. It is my hope that the student's hard work can demonstrate this to the government."

Was meeting with Kato too great of a risk? Fortunately for Takagi, a new solution presented itself firstly through a knock on the door.\n\nHaving been told to come in, it was Kido Koichi who entered the office.\n\n"Prime Minister, I understand that Kato has not been in contact with you?"\n\n"That is correct. Do you have some sort of suggestion for me?\n\n"That is exactly what I have for you, sir. I believe it would be wiser that someone visit Kato in your stead, possibly myself or Horikiri. It would be a private meeting, one that you can dictate the terms of without having to be in attendance yourself.\n\nIt did not take long for the Prime Minister to see the wisdom of this, which he signified to his deputy with a nod.\n\n"Then I would suggest you inform Kato of this change of plan immediately. Enough time has been wasted and I dread to think what could happen if Nakasone or Kishi were to speak to her first."\n\nKido bowed and departed to make the necessary calls for the meeting.

She was a difficult and unwieldy force to be reckoned with, he noted, and could not help but be intrigued by her passions for such an absurd cause. Nonetheless, he had a duty to piece together what she stood for, and understand her role in the recent chaos spreading throughout Japan's cities. Putting the clipboard to the side and crossing one leg over the other, Kido began to question Kato on her political positions and theory. He was seized by her theses, creating great mental notes on her postulations over the state of modern Japan. Kido nodded and smiled - he couldn't get enough of her bullshit."

 japtakagirecon.65.d:0 ""Haven't I already made it simple, Mr. Kido? A total abolition of the Kokumin Yuseiho. It is an insult and affront to the equality of the sexes and the respect of the nation."\n\nKato sat across from Kido, quite pleased with herself. She was firm and her position was immovable; she held her chin up and looked down upon the pampered Mr. Kido. They had been discussing her feminist theory for over an hour now, and Kido listened casually whilst scribbling notes. He sat across from her and watched from behind his clipboard, recording key pieces of information to be passed on in a later report, though at moments he found himself doodling during her over-scrupulous ranting.\n\nEventually, she had finished speaking and Kido saw his chance; referring to his notes, he glanced back up at her and prodded her with loaded questions: \n"I appreciate your passion, Miss Kato. I do ask, if I may, what grand solution to wipe away the 'Patriarchal Dictatorship' would repealing a single law be? Do you speak out for a second about the sterilisation clause? For a woman of modern academia, you have left a lot unclear."\n\nKido had a despicably smug look across his face. He had caught Kato out, and she was red-faced and furious. The meeting ended inconclusively, and although Kido left with his ego thoroughly stroked, none could claim victory over the other."

The two conversed whilst listening to birdsong and the breeze brushing through the Japanese maple leaves. Gradually, Kido prodded Kato to ask about her stance on the sterilization clause of the Kokumin Yuseiho, to which she cleared her throat and blinked a few times in astonishment. Kido chuckled, insisting he was curious as she did not relieve him with an answer in their last interaction. Comforted by the tranquil and serene environment, she began to disclose her thoughts to the well-dressed and cunning Mr. Kido:\n\n"In truth, my opinion... well I have no opinion. I have no problem with the sterilization clause. I have not come into any friction with it, and I don't understand how anyone would, frankly."\n\nKido's eyes lit up like stars as he nodded, maintaining his facade of genuine interest to keep her talking. Nudging his fingers across the underside of the table to check the bugging device was still recording, Kido broke into a firm smile that seemed to approve of Kato's stance. She explained herself, and every word he treated as a gift. She mentioned, somewhat reluctantly, that if the student's found out about this opinion she would be treated as an outcast and as an enemy. Kido's smile spread across his face, delighted her confessions were being recorded on tape, and his amiable expressions urged her to divulge further. He could barely contain his glee; this was all the evidence Kido needed, and he was already thinking of ways to blackmail her as he gazed into her eyes."

Indeed, as he presented the bounties of information to Takagi, the Prime Minister let out a genuine smile that stuck from cheek to cheek throughout the entire meeting. Kido, briefing Takagi with any and all information he needed to know about Kato, spoke for a long while, dashing between anecdotes and figures to help him make sense of the operation.\n\nTagaki stood up from his seat, still listening to Kido, and reached for a couple of luxury, expansive glasses from behind a cabinet. He poured a small amount of his finest champagne for himself and his colleague as Kido began to announce his news of the tapes. Thoroughly impressed, Takagi could not be more happy with the lengths Kido had gone to to gather the evidence required to keep Kato under his finger. They raised their glasses, and sipped from the wine with a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe Prime Minister fell back into his chair and exhaled a sigh of relief. Nodding his head in approval, he noted to Kido that he thought Kato was an idiot, but a useful one that had potential to be the unraveling of the student movement. With a sense of achievement, both Takagi and Kido took another sip of the champagne and sat back in their chairs, taking in this moment of personal victory."

However, Takagi's recent policy pushes would require all of Kido's connections and guile to successfully sell it to the Kazoku. The Deputy Prime Minister's task would be to convince some of the more conservative nobility of supporting Takagi. While he had no chance of winning them all over, there were some that could be convinced through flattery and conversation. As such, Kido had gathered his chosen candidates for lunch.\n\n"Esteemed gentlemen, I am honored that you have all accepted my invitation to lunch."\n\n"We could hardly refuse when you take us to lunch here, Kido." This comment was met with polite chuckles from Kido and the rest of the nobles around the table. "I hope whatever business you wish to discuss will not ruin this meal. I do understand it has something to do with that dreadful woman Kato, yes?\n\n"I am afraid so gentlemen. Yet, I do ask that you hear me out, The Prime Minister has agreed to implement some of Kato's reforms and he requires your support to succeed. I understand that you are far from keen to see Kato get her way, but this a matter of saving the nation from disaster in the long-term. These small reforms will pacify the student protests and restore order to the streets. Besides, most of the changes will go unnoticed by most people. They are mostly symbolic gestures that will ultimately protect national polity"\n\nIt would have been incorrect to describe the assembled Kazoku as convinced. Kido could tell that he had not entirely won them over, but planted the seeds of consideration in heads. Stressing the issue would not do any good..\n\n"I do not need to hear a yes or no right now, gentlemen. Please consider what I said in your own time. Now, let us enjoy the rest of this luncheon." Forcing the nobility to act was unwise. It was better to give them the idea that they were making the decisions."

While they had remained fairly amicable over the years since the divorce, they usually spoke over the phone or through letters. This time however, Kato had been adamant about meeting him in person. Ishimoto felt it was best not to refuse and therefore invited her to meet him at this office in the Imperial Diet building. Kato was slightly surprised to see Ishimoto eating his lunch when she arrived.\n\n"This was the only time in my schedule that was open. Hopefully you don't need too much time to say what you need to"\n\n"I'm going to need a favor. I won't lie, it's quite a big ask, but I need you to do this."\n\nThe old politician sighed before finishing the food on his plate. "Go on then, you might as well tell me what you want."\n\n"As you know, the Prime Minister and I have come to an agreement regarding reforms to the kokumin yuseiho. He is planning to move forward with these reforms and put them to a vote in the Imperial Diet. However, it's not clear how much support Takagi has for this. That's why I need your help."\n\n"I think I see what you want. You want me to whip up independent support for the Prime Minister, correct?"\n\nKato gave a simple nod as a reply.\n\n"Do you really think this is worth it? Some piecemeal reform to get the youth off the government's back for a few years?"\n\n"I need you to understand that this is probably the best shot we have of implementing some genuine reform. When was the last time we had a chance like this to make things better for so many people?. At times like this, you're going to have to put away your distaste for the Prime Minister to achieve something good.\n\nIshimoto remained silent for a good few seconds, but expression changed to that of reluctant acceptance. "Fine, I'll see what strings I can pull for you. You're going to need a lot of help to pull this off.""

The opposition sat with eager looks on their faces, keen to hear Kishi speak. Those who were yet undecided on the matter of the Kokumin Yuseiho were also keen to hear the reform bureaucrat speak; perhaps he could help them make up their minds. The Prime Minister and his supporters were less than enthused. Finally, Kishi stood up from his seat among the rows of representatives.\n\n"From its inception, I have been an opponent of this government. The ideological direction of the Prime Minister has swayed Japan off course and led us down into a shameful state. I had expected as much from this government, but I had not expected them to now stoop even lower. In the face of protesting students, the Prime Minister has bowed his head in defeat!"\n\nKishi paused to allow his fellow reform bureaucrats to laugh for a few moments, keeping a close eye on Takagi's facial expression.\n\n"As for what the Prime Minister is offering these students in the hopes of appeasing them, it is nothing short of the gradual destruction of our society. This government will surrender the moral fabric of the nation under the guise of being diplomats and populists. Talks of reforming laws such as the Kokumin Yuseiho violate the Kokutai itself! This, of course, begs the question of how far this government is prepared to tear Japan apart. Will the Kokutai soon be examined by a commission? Will the Taisei Yokusankai be forcefully disbanded? I dread to think what will happen if the Prime Minister is not stopped. Those men in this room who still have your dignity, your morals and your conscience, I ask of you to vote against any proposed reform to the Kokumin Yuseiho. The very future of the nation is otherwise at risk."\n\nKishi was met with great applause by his fellows as he sat down.

I have a reputation!"\n\nIkeda stood on the opposite end of the boardroom from the Prime Minister, with a hand in his pockets and the other waving about, exclaiming his reluctance to support Takagi's legislation in the Diet. He was a conservative, and he stood against such sweeping reform. However, with such a precarious and uncertain political climate, Ikeda relied on stability, even if it came from this Prime Minister. After what felt like hours of tense reasoning, Takagi felt like Ikeda was on a knife's edge; with a bit of bartering, he could be convinced. The old man was wary of even mentioning any attempt to repeal the Konoe-era law, and sighed out of frustration - despite everything, Takagi's plan was the safest option for the stability of the nation.\n\n"It's hardly religion, Ikeda. It's our last chance - there's no saying the Taisei Yokusankai will survive if we don't pass this through. The old law will go, but a new one will fall in its place. You have my word, the protections will stay in place."\n\nIkeda slowly shut his eyes. He bit his lip and slowly nodded, his hands sinking to his sides as he visibly began to concede to the Prime Minister. Takagi approached him with a smile and patted him on the back, thanking him for his support. Ikeda shook his head and made a point, noting that his support will disappear the moment legislation deviates from this promised path. Takagi, assuring Ikeda, grabbed his hand and shook it firmly. With a tired smile, Ikeda shook it back and buried his hands deep in his pockets again."

Starting early in the morning, they had all spent their day trying to gather every last scrap of support or influence they could collectively muster. Before they began their meeting, they had all taken a moment to breathe. When Kido and Horikiri had entered the office they too were quite clearly out of breath. The three men sat around the Prime Minister's table, and Takagi began by explaining what he had managed throughout the day.\n\nThe Prime Minister had focused on his connections among the navy, hoping to limit their involvement in the matter or even get them to support him. Takagi had also worked to shore up the liberal clique in the diet, to ensure that none of them had any sudden ideas about how to vote. While the Prime Minister was not calling upon the largest pool of support, he was undeniably bringing in old allies that had always been fairly reliable. Takagi was therefore grateful for Horikiri and Kido, who had contacts of their own to call upon.\n\nAs expected, Deputy Prime Minister Kido had contacted numerous members of the House of Peers as well as a few officials in the Imperial Household. Meanwhile, Horikiri had spent his time hunting down potential allies in the House of Representatives.\n\nAll of this they told the Prime Minister, who, while clearly listening, was locked in deep consideration. Before ending the meeting for the night, Takagi summarized his feelings on the matter.\n\n"Even with all the allies we have gathered, the favors we have called in, and whatever other methods we have deployed, it is not yet clear whether we can be sure of victory. This is the beginning of the job, and I do not suspect it will be much easier to finish. We have stabilized our foundations, but now we must build a highrise.""

I would like to declare this government's efforts to approach the final repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho."\n\nTakagi paused in his speech, gazing into the sea of bobbing heads that watched him from the chamber's floor. He had spoken for almost twenty minutes, describing his new policy drive to the National Diet. His elucidations were clothed in a unique pragmatism; he was aware of the traditions and duties he had to uphold as Prime Minister but also conscious of the increasingly popular demands of the students who stood to protest in the streets again. Takagi stood tall and firm, yet his words sailed over the heads of many sitting in the hall.\n\nIt became more and more obvious towards the conclusion of the Prime Minister's speech that the Diet was split. Independents and Kidoites nodded and applauded the motions of Prime Minister Takagi, hailing him as a wise and pragmatic mediator. The same could not be said for the Reform Bureaucrats and many of the conservatives that filled the Diet's seats, as they shook their heads and audibly protested the speech with low groans and mumbles. An empty applause sounded throughout the great hall. From his podium, even with the supportive grins of allies in the Diet, it was clear that many would not even consider supporting him after voicing his intention to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. The Prime Minister let out a tired sigh, bowing his head from behind the platform, and retreated back to his seat as the session continued."

Takagi was beyond arguing with her as they had for months now, and simply snapped at her that the Diet was not cooperating with any attempt to revoke the law. He spoke down to her, scowling that the necessity to appeal to conservatives and independents in the Taisei Yokusankai was their only hope to gain a majority. It was daunting to the Prime Minister; he found himself at a stand-still - how could he convince moderates and conservatives to vote in favor of such a radical and liberal action?\n\nKato, turning to the Prime Minister after a brief moment, suddenly proposed a counter offer as Tagaki pinched the bridge of his nose in an exhausted and defeated frustration. She mentioned, to appease those who oppose the repeal, he could introduce legal protections expanding state welfare, childcare, and even legalizing abortion. Takagi looked up from his enraged despair, and with a confused smile he wagged his finger at her smug face. He refused to show his excitement; he wouldn't give her the satisfaction of being right. As he quietly signaled a servant to get on the phone to Kido, Kato smiled and began to listen to the birdsong of the gardens, finding peace in the Prime Minister's non-verbal gratification."

After a particularly heated moment, Takagi rubbed his brow and asked for Ikeda's honest opinion of the move to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. Ikeda inhaled a large breath, and then relented, mentioning he was personally apathetic. What mattered, he insisted, was that the government had a system in place to defend the traditional morality of the nation. National Eugenics Law or not, Ikeda confessed, many conservatives would support a respectful homage to the traditions of the empire in the budget and government policy proposals.\n\nTakagi was silent, staring at the man in confusion. Surely it was not that easy, he thought, in denial of the whole affair. The Prime Minister, now at relative ease compared to the anger of the earlier argument, could not hide his astonishment; he had the information he needed to get the conservatives behind a replacement bill. He still had to wrestle with the legislature, but understanding the Ikeda's platform on abortion and other issues gave him information key to drawing up a potentially successful bill in the National Diet. The question was, how much should he give them?"

Takagi stopped him once Kido had shuffled out of the door, and asked the minister about his family and personal life. After a short but amiable exchange of conversation, Takagi brought up the recent movements to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho.\n\n"To be totally honest, sir, I support the repeal. It's a better alternative to overbearing state power. It's not perfect, but all things considered I think it's the best way forward." Nakasone nodded, and spoke frankly to the Prime Minister after affirming his loyalties. Takagi, pleased to hear this, stood upright and proud to shake Nakasone's hand. In a political scene where rivals critiqued him from all sides, the Prime Minister was pleased to know that his ministers shared the same opinion as he did. He knew this was expected of his own government, but was grateful nonetheless that he could find at least some peace being surrounded by his closest aides and colleagues."

The air in the chamber suddenly grew thick and tense as Takagi began to sweat beneath his suit. He could feel the disapproving gaze from traditionalists in the Diet prickling his skin.\n\nHailing the potential of the legal reorganization to bring positive social reform to Japanese society, the Prime Minister continued his speech with a calm and cool composure, hiding his panic from political rivals. As he began to finalize the final clauses of his bill, Takagi's irritated eyes drifted over to the seats on the right of the chamber; dozens of conservatives had collected their belongings and attempted to leave mid-session, clearly outraged at what the Prime Minister had presented to them. The speaker called them back, but to no avail. Feeling powerless, Takagi stood behind his podium and stared into the thin air, tired of facing constant friction in his efforts to solve the empire's troubles."

Takagi began to speak to the Diet, reading from a prepared speech, and maintained a calm and controlled decorum to distinguish his own authority over the diverging interests tearing the Taisei Yokusankai to pieces.\n\nComplete with all amendments, such as tightened restrictions on the period of pregnancy termination and a government-approved gynecological code of ethics, the bill had been taken apart and pieced back together many times over to find approval from the conservatives in the House of Peers. Takagi waved the bill, priding it for its comprehensive covering of modern attitudes towards women's health, whilst acknowledging a respectful relationship it had with traditional morality seen as virtuous across the nation. Despite this, however, the amendments did not inoculate the Prime Minister from scrutiny, and scowls from conservative factions of the Taisei Yokusankai were frequent as he gazed into the crowds of men scoffing at his works.\n\nThe Prime Minister finished his speech and sat down in the lukewarm tumble of applause that sounded from the Diet floor.

Her breathing was labored; her mouth and throat were thoroughly dried out. She rested, face lying on the rim of the toilet. It was not until a faint light shone through the window that she stood up, ever so cautiously. She looked at the mess in her toilet wondering how long this cycle of getting up to vomit and then going back to bed had gone on.\n\nShe flushed it away. Maybe she could ask her boyfriend what was going on? He was in the medical department, after all.

Takagi asked his colleagues, prompting them to reflect on their voting records.\n\nThe Prime Minister had met Ikeda Masanosuke and Miki Takeo in a boardroom in the National Diet building for a 'private conversation' that had since turned into a grilling, with Takagi pressing them on their intentions in the Diet. Time and time again they proudly voted against his reforms, with smug looks on their faces, and now the Prime Minister was here to convince them otherwise.\n\n"Prime Minister, we are simply not convinced your legislative proposals are appropriate in bringing 'reform' to the empire. We cannot stand for your misappropriation of our nation's traditions and customs. Some would call it an outrage!"\n\n"Mr. Miki, what respect do you have for integrity and custom when you attack this government by voting down our every effort to improve this nation? Where is the honor when you vote down bills that could help us fight poverty and corruption? Our government can and will work with you if you would only let us; this is a matter of supporting the empire in times of, frankly, great instability."\n\nTakagi extended his hand towards the two men, explaining further that he wished to have their support in the Diet to defend the empire from civil unrest. Ikeda and Miki appeared embarrassed as Takagi had cornered them, caging their loyalty with their own credences. The Prime Minister grinned as they both shook his hand after a long pause - the bargain had worked, and the conservatives had given in to the pressure."

 japtakagirecon.85.d:0 "Nakasone had met with Kishi in a private garden not far from the National Diet building, and the two were discussing the personal affairs of their lives before coming onto the topic of politics. Coming to a bench, the two men sat down and relaxed their legs; Kishi joked about his old age and compared himself with the naive youth of Nakasone's political career. They chuckled and debated further, surrounded by the natural serenity of the garden.\n\n"You know, Nakasone, your seat in the Prime Minister's government has really binded you to a single path. Takagi's actions have taped you to the image of reform and short-sighted change," Kishi sighed, before continuing, "It's a shame really... but there is a way out."\n\nHe looked over to Nakasone, who was eager to hear from someone far more experienced than he was. Forgetting the political maneuvering and Takagi's warnings about the man, he could not resist asking Kishi more.\n\n"My son, we've done it in the past," Kishi chuckled, "Even the Americans do it. I have no real issue with Takagi's attempt to bring in a surrogate law after the Kokumin Yusehio is repealed. A powerful opposition will defund and neglect the surrogate law to punish the Prime Minister, rather than wasting energy fighting him for it."\n\nNaksone was struck with surprise and intrigue; he could not have come up with a more sinister yet wildly effective strategy to strike in the Diet. Kishi, even as an old man, had his despicable wits about him at all times. Though attempting to resist his malevolent influences, Nakasone could not help but feel enthralled by the irresistible wisdom of the veteran."

 japtakagirecon.86.d:0 "Takagi once again stood in front of the Diet to present a bill drafted with the conservatives in mind - the Special Groups and Youth Protections Act. Tired of friction, the bill was edited to appeal to and potentially command the support of Ikeda's faction of the Taisei Yokusankai in its vote. The law aimed to expand state-run orphanages and sponsored childcare, funding youth institutions with millions of yen. Takagi read out his intentions to the chamber with a strong pride in an attempt to gather attention from listening members, but few seemed interested in his proposals.\n\nEven noting the preservation of the sterilisation clause, Takagi was astonished to witness a great lazy apathy that had swept the Diet. He felt a confusing frustration; in all of his years of experience, nothing had prepared him to react to such sloth and general disinterest in this chamber. Takagi was puzzled, and as he looked to the side to prompt his cabinet for aid, they too were bewildered by the occasion. Some men nodded quietly whilst listening to the speech, and others yawned with indifference; the Prime Minister expected diligence and duty, but simply did not know how to ask for it."

She looked at the cheap clock hanging on the wall. The hands were pointing at the bear holding up the number 12, smiling. Kato was not. It had been precisely seven hours since she first arrived, and another eight since she first woke up. The weight of her fatigue cascaded down on her shoulders, bringing her closer and closer to the brink of collapsing. Yet Kato did not. \n\There was cleaning to do, not to mention giving the cats their food. Ever since rats were discovered to be infesting the place, they had adopted five strays to keep them at bay. Kato idly wondered why they couldn't have just hired exterminators to snuff out the rats. Not to mention that she and Michi had to replace the floorboards in the playroom next week. Kato sighed, brushing her hands when she had finished distributing the cans of cat food.\n\nDinner would have to be cooked, both for herself and the children. Just more work to do. She mumbled inside, donning the apron and taking ingredients out from the refrigerator. The hours may be long, the conditions not the best, but Kato was nothing if not caring. She would soldier on for the children."

Kato, making her rounds around the table, looked once at the boy, raising her eyebrows in concern. Silently, she walked over to him, leaning over slightly to observe what he was doing. Chatter filled the room, as the children began to show off their art to their friends.\n\nIn one hand, he held a gorgeous white and pink camellia, twirling it around occasionally. Kato moved to see the drawing he was making. It certainly wasn't the best by far -- after all, it was a ten year old drawing intricate details -- but it was leaps and bounds better than his peers.\n\n"What are you drawing?" Kato asked, expecting an answer.\n\nNo response.\n\n"Alright. If you don't mind, I'll just watch." The boy nodded his head slowly, letting Kato take a seat next to him. For the next thirty minutes, Kato and the 'camellia boy', as she had taken to calling him, stayed silent as he drew his camellia. Kato looked at the time, realizing she was late to dismiss the children for dinner. Kato stood up, cupping her hands over her mouth.\n\n"It's time for dinner! I'll be with you in a minute." She leaned down to sit again, tapping the camellia boy on the shoulder. "Before you go, what's your name?"\n\nThe boy opened his mouth: "Mi--". For a second, he panicked, before quickly muttering. "Naya Kaori.""

A transaction was usually the norm: Kato would ply Kaori with candy, cheap art supplies, and if she was lucky, a small art print. In exchange, Kaori would tell her a little part about himself. This dance had gone on for a month, with Kato and Kaori slowly becoming like mother and son.\n\nAs Kato was opening the high windows to invite the wind in, she felt a tug on her pants. She looked down from the stool, seeing the face of Kaori looking directly up at her. She opened the last window, setting the stick down against the wall. As she stepped down from the stool, Kaori spoke.\n\n"Kato-sensei, the other kids don't have parents, right?" He inquired, eyes wide.\n\n"Most don't." Kato replied, beginning to walk to the kitchen.\n\n"But...why don't they have parents?" Kaori called out.\n\nKato stopped in the hallway, looking back at Kaori, as her face fell. How could she explain the horrors of war to him? An innocent child shouldn't be burdened by her struggles. Where would she even start? She looked down, then back at Kaori, almost pitying him. She desperately wanted to answer, to tell him of her pain. Yet he wasn't old enough to understand.\n\nHe never would be. No one would ever be old enough to understand."

Cold air breezed past the boy's face, as tiny drops of cold pelted his face. None were out on the drenched street at this time, probably asleep in better clothing, blankets, and beds than he would ever get. He was a Gokiburi, a cockroach. People like him didn't deserve quarter. Didn't deserve anything. How he was lucky enough to end up here, he didn't know.\n\n"Kaori? Why are you awake?" Kato-sensei was here. She was always so nice to him. His face suddenly soured, and he didn't respond, only acknowledging her presence by turning around.\n\n"Couldn't sleep."\n\nThe teacher walked over to his position, stopping short of the window. "Why couldn't you?" She sat down on his bed. No response from Kaori. Reaching into her pocket, she pulled out a Hershey's bar, offering it to him. He knew this trick well, and he was going to fall for it. Taking the chocolate, he began speaking.\n\n"I know now. I know why I was separated from my original parents." Kaori sighed. "I'm a bastard -- a filthy Korean. My name, the name that I was given when I was born, that is, is actually Min Yoongi." Hot tears flowed down his face, as heavy as the tapping rain outside. Kato could hear his sniffling and heavy breathing, struggling to keep his composure in the face of all-consuming fear. "If you want to--if..." The sound of sniffling and hiccups swallowed whatever else he had to say.\n\nKato looked ashamed. A tense silence filled the room for several minutes, seeming to suffocate any and all conversation before it could ever start. Min Yoongi, Naya Kaori, the camellia boy, all three parts of his identity disappeared, and a scared boy was laid bare before Kato's eyes. Kato moved to turn on the lamp, illuminating the dark room with light. His head looked down, balling up, as though to protect himself from the world.\n\n"I'll keep your secret." Kato broke the silence. She would not abandon her duty now, as a teacher, as someone who had his utmost confidence. If she wouldn't protect Yoongi from a society vehemently against his people, who would?\n\n'No one should,' she thought. The camellia on the nightstand shed a few of its petals, as though it was crying with Yoongi."

He held his hands on his hips with a proud stance, basking in the glory of a small yet meaningful victory.\n\nAfter a moment of joy, Takagi turned to his colleagues and gazed at them as they slouched and fell into their seats. The two men looked at the Prime Minister, beaten and bruised by their own cynicism, and reminded him that the journey to ending the mess in Japan's streets was far from over. They spoke harshly to Takagi, catching his attention in an instant, but he did not reprimand them. Rather, he glanced over to them, seeing their fatigue and exhaustion, and spared them the punishment. After all, he was not feeling particularly energetic himself. The protesters still roared in the streets, and the fight to reform the empire had remained an uphill battle for the Prime Minister.

Not notified of this before, his natural curiosity took him to the ominous envelope, opening it slowly and with caution. It was addressed directly to him, hand-written in ink from Kato, much to his surprise, in an unknown and undisclosed location.\n\nIn her writing, Kato extended her thanks to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Kido for their dignity. She noted that she is disappointed that she could not thank them both in person due to unforeseen consequences, but did express that she regarded them as men of virtue in an otherwise dejected Japanese political landscape. As he read words of respect from Kato, Takagi was overcome with a sense of honor; despite the Diet heckling her as a radical and misandrist, he felt proud that he treated her with the same respect he expected of others. As she signed off, Takagi stood still and was silent - this would be the last he would hear from her. Feeling the nostalgia of their brief encounters, he reminisced about her eloquence and fluency when speaking and the respect he had even for her bizarre politics."

The sunset's golden rays danced between the jagged skyline of Tokyo's skyscrapers, and as Takagi approached the end of his second term he could not help but consider what he would have done differently given the chance to.\n\nMemories of endless compromise flickered through Takagi's mind; the uncomfortable dealings with Kishi and Ikeda and the routine bargaining with independents haunted him. Compromising and throwing away potential for real economic restructuring consumed the Prime Minister, as he regretted leaving much of it up to the whims of Nakasone out of frustration. Takagi looked down to what he considered tainted hands, dirtied with his involvement in the political corruption and coercion he railed against in the beginning of his career. He wondered if it was a necessary evil, or simply avoidable if he just tried harder.\n\nBiting his lip, the Prime Minister retreated to his desk, falling into his leather chair and scratching his chin. He gulped and felt an overwhelming passion - after all of the struggles between these few triumphs, Japan had barely tasted reform. A sense of defeat fell over Takagi as he realized the dexterity and determination that initially surrounded his administration had since fallen to waste, leaving him to wonder if he had fallen with it."

He wiped his mouth of any spilled water droplets and leaned over the kitchen counter-top for a moment to think.\n\nHe couldn't take his mind off of it; following such resounding defeats and constant friction, Takagi was all but certain that he had been dejected from the Diet. He lived where the Prime Minister would live, and he sat where the Prime Minister would sit, but he could not command authority in the Diet for much longer. Conservatives branded him a coward and a traitor; liberals vilified him in accusations of despotism - he felt there was no balance to be struck anymore. Takagi gazed out of the window and into the estate's gardens and watched the moonlit sky beam a silver-blue light on the short grass. He found a slither of peace watching nature so still in the deadest of the night.\n\nAfter another moment of silent and demoralized pondering, Takagi made his way back to his bed and crawled underneath the sheets to find some respite.

He could not find peace in simply glancing at the monument of Japanese civilization anymore; it brought him nothing but cynicism and fatigue.\n\nThe newspapers this morning read that thirty more students had been reported dead following clashes with law enforcement in the rioting, and Takagi of all people felt pained by this most. He shut his eyes and reflected, questioning if he had done enough in his position of power across the empire. The Diet could barely agree on anything, and Japan's youth, a significant portion of the public, would forever remember him as a tyrant. Takagi was overcome with an immense dread, only noticeable in his deeper breaths and glossy eyes. After a gulp, he hearkened towards the darkening sky beyond the glass and turned to his desk to find a pen.

He had done this sort of work for the Tokko so many times that it was a mere routine for him. From his car, or an empty building nearby, he could watch his target throughout the day, making sure to keep note of when they left their house and for how long. After about a week of this partner, Kanda had a detailed idea of just how his target spent their time.\n\nKato Shidzue had been an interesting target for Kanda. Kato was not oblivious to her current position, as she always checked the lock on her doors twice before heading out. She would also wear dark sunglasses and a hat which obscured her face. She would do this every time she left the house, always scanning her surroundings before heading to her car. Once his week of observation had ended, the Tokko agent was ready to begin his real task.\n\nAs usual, Kato left her house at twelve o clock, something she had done for the past four days. Kanda was not especially interested in where she was going, only that she would likely be gone for at least two hours. That was more than enough time for him to work. Stepping out of his car, he headed over to Kato's house and quietly picked the simple lock. Once inside, he wasted no time in wiretapping both the phones in her home andre-locking her front door. After which he drove off in his car back to Tokko HQ. Of course, he did not want to miss the results of his work.\n\nOnce Kato had returned home Kanda and his colleagues began to listen in. Only a few minutes after she had got in the door, the phone rang.\n\n"Kato, we need to meet with you at the book club at ten o'clock tomorrow. 'Thoreau', 'Fitzgerald' and 'Hemmingway' will be there when you arrive. They'll be waiting at the corner table for you when you arrive.

In order to blend in, they would enter the club as plainclothes and wait for the targets to arrive. The Tokko themselves arrived at the location at precisely twenty-past eight. As to avert suspicion, the agents all entered at random intervals. The book club was little more than a large, converted basement. The walls were lined with bookshelves, and a desk had been placed in front of what might have been a back room. The agents began to read or make small talk with the friendly, if cautious staff. So far, they were the only people there.\n\nAt around half-past nine, a man entered, who made his way over to the corner table. Three minutes later another man entered, who dallied around the shelves before joining the first man at the table. Finally, a woman entered the club and sat herself down at the table. By quarter to nine, none of the three figures had left their spots and no one else had entered. Kanda therefore judged it to be time to act. After a quick gesture to his fellow agents, he drew his gun and pointed it at the corner table.\n\nAll of you, get your hands up now. Do the cover names 'Ffitzgerald','Hhemingway' and 'Tthoreau' mean anything to you'"\n\nThe trio at the table now had four guns pointed at them. While seemingly frozen with fear, they still managed to nod in response to the question."\n\n" Good. Now get in the back room.

It was quiet inside. Despite the club's relatively small size, the only people she could see were the two members of staff. They did not do as much as greet Kato as she stepped inside. Immediately, she noticed that the corner table was unoccupied. Her watch told her she was exactly on time. The feeling of panic began to set in as she turned to look at the staff for a possible answer. The brief look she got from one of them turned panic into fear. With only his eyes, the staff member seemed to say:\n\n"Run"\n\nKato turned back towards the door and raced up the steps. She was stopped in her tracks by three men, all pointing guns at her.

Dozens of arrests were made each day and several universities had even been stormed by the police. While life carried on in Tokyo, an oppressive mood hung over the city. Yet In the quieter corners of Tokyo,, peaceful gatherings were still able to take place. At the spot where Kato Shidzue had last been seen, a candlelit vigil had begun, with hundreds in attendance. Apart from the sounds of distant police sirens, the street was completely quiet. At the top of the steps down into the book club basement, a number of signs had been placed with messages of appreciation for Kato and her activism. A young woman, one of the many students in attendance that had personally spoken to Kato, began to read a message she had written. The student hoped that somehow, whether Kato was, she would hear it and know that her sacrifice was not in vain. Before she had a chance to begin reading, a police car pulled up.\n\nRoof-mounted speakers loudly blared for the crowds to disperse, claiming that they were blocking a busy road. Without warning, the street began to flood with police, who set about dismantling the vigil. Those who did not move out of their way were beaten down or shoved forcefully to the ground. As more and more of the students attempted to get away, they found themselves surrounded by police from nearly every angle. What at first seemed like warning shots from the approaching police quickly began to hit the fleeing students. Panic and chaos set in, and the struggle to get away became increasingly desperate. Those caught by the police were pushed into vans and driven away, or otherwise beaten until let go. By the street was empty, the bodies of three students lay lifeless among the remains of the vigil.

Where once Tokyo had essentially been the only city that was being rocked by intense riots, now Nagoya and Osaka were also deeply affected. As the authorities' response to the demands of the students grew harsher and harsher, it seemed that the protesters only became more determined to fight back. Smashed windows, overturned cars and fires in the streets were now a common sight across several major cities. More peaceful gatherings were met with crackdowns from the police as soon as they sprung up. Simply being in some form of attendance was enough to warrant an arrest. Once released, they were usually beaten and bloodied, their bodies acting as a warning sign for what could happen if they did not stop protesting. Some were not so lucky. Many seemed to disappear, both literally and from police records. Others suffered the extreme brutality during the riots themselves. "Inaccurate warning shots" and "falls" were common excuses for the mounting pile of bodies.\n\nEven as the police deployed these measures against anyone found during a riot, it did nothing to end the unrest. The riots continued, growing larger and larger each day, as each death or disappearance added fuel to the fires. By this point, it was largely impossible for the general population to ignore the events happening outside their windows. Everyone knew a nephew or neighbour's child who had been blasted by a water cannon or bashed by a riot shield. Everyone had heard the stories of parents losing their children, deaths which the police or national media had yet to acknowledge.\n\nTokyo, Nagoya and Osaka were lit at night by the fires of unrest while similar flames promised to be enkindled across more cities.

Raising a middle ground, the Prime Minister could continue to use force in the most violent riots, whilst simultaneously strengthening the committee to reexamine the Kokumin Yuseiho.

It is not worthy of the empire and all our forefathers have given us."\n\nThe father smiled, seeing the Prime Minister on the television, but lost his joy when looking over to his apathetic daughter, who seemed disinterested in the appeals of Takagi to end the riots.\n\n"... Which is why this government has decided to strengthen the commission to reform the Kokumin Yuseiho. If the Emperor's subjects want change, change they shall get - we will begin hard work to craft an all-inclusive settlement of this issue once and for all. However, this can only be completed with the cooperation of all parties involved, and an end to the riots."\n\nThe teenage daughter scoffed, rolling her eyes at the broadcast - much to her father's disapproval. She grumbled, hurling insults at the Prime Minister for his arrogance and misogyny before storming off to her bedroom. The girl's father was astonished and remained still in his seat, shocked by the encounter. He returned his attention back to the television, and noticing the speech had ended, he softly sang the occasional word of 'Kimigayo' along with the broadcast."

With your recent calls to end the violence and appeal to reason, it seems like the protests are beginning to clean themselves up."\n\nTakagi, barely conscious and exhausted from working, took a moment to process what Zenjiro had told him. He rubbed his eyes and stretched, and as he flicked through the documents he sprung into action.\n\n"As you can read in the dossier, our surveillance has reported that the moderate student unions have begun dispersing from the streets, and are now encouraging their members to write to their MPs instead."\n\nTakagi's spirits raised almost in an instant; he jumped from his seat to march over to Zenjiro, shaking his hand and thanking him for his work.

Bystanders were swarmed in the masses of protestors; women and children feared being caught up in the violence; normal life came to a halt in the affected areas.\n\nThe crowds of protests turned their attention to ranks of armored police divisions who were now marching down the wide Tokyo streets. It was late evening, though the night sky was lit with the embers of dumpster fires and makeshift floodlights. Supported by armored vehicles, the police units trudged forward towards the chaotic crowds now scampering to face them. Bracing, they lifted their shields as thrown bricks and other debris clattered against their armor. Clashes between law enforcement and protesters erupted, and many officers were outnumbered by the maddened students.\n\nSuddenly, a crashing burst of water shot across the road and hurled many students to the ground. The water cannons were used to support the encircled officers and back the students away from them. Moreover, the pop of teargas canisters among the ruined streets dispersed many of the rioters, allowing the police units to sweep in and contain the demonstrations. Students were beaten in the streets, and hundreds of arrests were made that night. The rioters had become a threat to Japanese civilization itself, the Prime Minister claimed, and to combat this he approved law enforcement with the order to treat them as such."

Uncomfortably obliging, Takagi dismissed the minister and was overcome with a concerning sense of defeat.\n\nBargaining with the idea, Takagi thought deeply after Nakasone had left his office - how could he be cornered like this? Such was the reality, however, and the Prime Minister had little choice but to accept it. His influence over the cabinet was diminishing, and Nakasone's break from the established line could be the beginning of the end for the government. Fighting unreasonable beliefs, Takagi sat still and exhaled, returning to his stoic position and managing his thoughts to fit what would be best to move on with.

A measure you propose that fits the description will be sure to garner my vote, and perhaps some from my allies too. The problem is, you don't have the full confidence of the Diet. They may applaud your speeches and support the government, but a lot of men in that room hate working with you.

A sinister smirk spread across his own face, acknowledging Kishi's congratulations, and he raised his arm to wave at the members still applauding on the floor of the Diet.\n\nNotably abstaining from the bill, Takagi's silence has been regarded as bitterness by his rivals in the Diet.

Above the chalkboard were pro-imperial slogans and icons, referred to daily by teachers as paragons of youthful virtue and education. Class six, taught by the proud and protective Mr. Tamotsu, began their work on teaching the older children about Choson in the empire; the teacher amazed the class with bright and sensual tales of Japanese altruism and charity in the region, as well as educating them on the might and benevolence of the military in defending the peninsula.

College deans and staff had reported on the rising number of student societies named after revered emperors of Japan, each one filled with dozens of hysterical and youthful nationalist cliques. Moreover, student-organised plays began to air commemorating Japanese victory in the Japan–Qing War, the victory in the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan, as well as entire strings of conflicts throughout the Greater East Asia War.

 japtakagirecon.126.d:0 "Accompanied by IJN marines, geological surveyors and businessmen examined and scaled the resource-rich areas of New Britain due for extraction. They were tasked with the eviction of natives from their villages on the land, and approached the local leaders with the aid of translators. Attempting to negotiate, the businessmen tried every trick they knew to convince the natives to leave and alluded to financial compensation, but to no avail. With every word the businessmen uttered, a deeper red flush of anger swept over their faces as they too began to realise the ignorance and insanity of their proposition.\n\nIn their dealings, an altercation arose from a dispute; the natives were outraged at the ignorance and greed shown by the foreigners. The negotiators retreated back to their encampment, scampering to escape from the increasingly rowdy crowds now gathered to heckle at the negotiators. With the failure to make a deal, it had been noted by field command that the marines were sanctioned to use deadly force in response to any resistance; they cocked their rifles and leapt from the back of military vehicles, marching to the settlements with cold, objectifying stares.\n\nMoving into the small village, the marines opened fire and mowed down the natives for having the gall to resist the "negotiations". The crackle of gunshots and wails of natives could be heard from the distance as the surveyors awkwardly awaited clearance from the IJN. Runaways were shot, homes were burned, and survivors were beaten for their disobedience. As the businessmen and negotiators re-entered the village they were met with scowls from the surviving and subdued locals."

Fen watched the sunset from the rickety balcony, ever-so-slightly creaking as she lit the lanterns. She rushed to the front of her house, turning on the porch lights, to give anyone walking outside some light to find their way back home. Ever since the power had gone out -- it had never come back on for about five years -- they had all agreed to light up the streets by whatever means they could. For Fen, it was porch lights, for others, it was via lanterns and candles. As she fiddled with the batteries, the day finished its transition into dusk. One minute, the streets were dark. The next, all of the street and the houses were soaked in golden light.\n\nTens of people, from the elderly, to the children who had barely learned to walk, rushed out of their homes, stunned by the sudden brightness. The tall white poles shone once more, as metal roofs and rickety wooden porches became bright as day. Perhaps it was useless to those outside of the slums, but to the inhabitants here, this light was as beautiful as gold."

Now, after all of his strenuous efforts, it was buried under the constant stream of cars that would bring him home. Today, like any Friday, the hordes of cars turned into a gas-fuming swamp. If Ruogang was lucky enough, he would be home by ten, but even then the only thing he could do during a coveted moment of solitude would be to prepare a simple dinner, set an alarm, and hope that he wasn't tired enough to oversleep. There must be another way, he thought.\n\nAn old mountain road. Feng once told him that he sometimes takes it just to escape traffic jams. It was quite an awkwardly disguised route, but if all urban routes were clogged it should be a faster way to get home. Ruogang smiled, for perhaps the first time in a week, and approached his old Toyota. It was not as shiny as it was seven years ago, but it still did the job well enough, just as he did. Ruogang passed a dozen odd streets just to find one Feng mentioned, but in the end he found an exit from the claustrophobic city and drove down the old mountain road.\n\nThe path was bumpy, rattling his car constantly, considerably worse than what Feng told him. The road was covered in potholes, ruined by age and poorly lit with flickering bulbs only every few minutes. Even a seemingly safe stretch of the path could be dangerous. It was almost nine, and as his urge to speed up the journey bubbled in his chest, Ruogang stepped on the gas pedal and clenched his hands on the wheel. His eyes were tired and drowsy. His head hit the ceiling of the car, his hands flew off the wheel, the vehicle tipped over, and he gazed into the fast-approaching forested earth below."

Giggling and restless, the boys greeted their mother back.\n\n"Konnichiwa okasan!"\n\nHer eyes widened and her jaw dropped as her children skipped away to play in their room. Confusion ran through her head and hammered at her skull; she wondered why her own sons did not greet her in their native Taiwanese Hokkien language. It must have been the schools, she thought as she panicked, unsure of how to react. Her sons always praised the way things were in Japan; they watched Japanese television, read Japanese stories, ate Japanese foods, and much to her prickling resentment, they were losing their own Taiwanese identity she had taught them."

He was paid enough to afford his food and bills, but could not scrape enough pay together for much else. It was a simple living, but he, like many other miners in the region, was always on the lookout to make extra money for himself if he could.\n\nOn one of the night shifts, Sung-Nam and a few other miners were working in the deepest tunnels of the mine; they were tasked with the extraction of wolframite, one of the rare and valuable ores that processed into tungsten, a vital component in the arms industry that ran the imperial war machine. They hammered and drilled chunks of the ore from the walls of the mine for hours at a time, but the twinkling glimpse of a shiny, silver material had caught Sung-Nam's eye. Acknowledging that supervisors were absent in the early hours of the morning, the impoverished miners discussed and gathered around the vein; no one knew what the material was, but split equally between them, it was sure to sell for a high price.\n\nSome time after his tiresome shift, Sung-Nam went to the local market, filled to the brim with the chatter of people and little shops packed with trinkets and fragrances. Bargaining with a merchant, he sold the mineral for a hefty sum, almost half of his usual salary. The ore probably cost a lot more, but he was happy with the price he sold for, as for the first time in months he could afford a fresh and juicy cut of meat for dinner."

Byeong-ho tried to get some sleep, but his efforts were made vain by the general clattering and shuddering of the train carriage rushing down the railways. After some time, he decided to gaze out the window, and he saw a beautiful plain of fields, with luscious bright green grass. In that instant, his body shot forward and he heard a bellowing crash.\n\nInvestigators arrived at the incident site only three hours later; the train was in utter ruin - the carts had flown off the rails and were scattered across the field, some of them were still burning. Most of the passengers managed to crawl out of overturned carts and expose their seared flesh to the beaming sun. Many were not so lucky, and rows of lifeless bodies were left lying on the burned grass, covered by dirty white sheets. Upon further examination, investigators noticed something wrong with the rails - the steel was ripped and chewed apart like rotting wood.\n\nThe track geometry report concluded that this section of railroad was in no condition to sustain high-speed trains, and was in need of modernization. Trains swarm the plains and hills of Northern Choson like blowflies, the investigators noted, and this incident may be the first of many more potential disasters in the future. The report was shuffled about the various levels of administration in Choson, until finally reaching Tokyo, where it held the attention of the Prime Minister, who had become concerned over the frequency of the disasters."

He always was a rebellious boy, fighting authority in ways that often caused more harm than good.\n\nA sudden knock hammered from outside of the barn - they had been found.\n\n"Sung-Chul, our death... will it not be in vain?"\n\nHe was at a loss for words, unable to react. Their lonely resistance cell was discovered before they could do anything worthwhile. The Tokko's forces had stormed their improvised hideout and killed most of them in the raid, and only a lucky few found a way out to disperse through the night to safety. For Ji-Tae and Sung-Chul, their luck had just run out.\n\n"No, it won't. No matter the time, we die for our motherland, and our efforts will not go to waste."\n\nJi-Tae let out a soft sigh of relief before coughing up blood.

The offices of the administration lay in the north, the mountainous and craggy terrain of Sarawak spread out behind them, hiding the high jungles with a veil of grey mist. The warm winds blew seawards, venting the oppressive heat from Sakai's body. His destination was a shrine on one of the hilltops near the administrative complexes. Masao often meditated there when he was not whipping the locals to submission or bullying his subordinates.\n\nNeedless to say, Sakai hated his role as a courier. At least the news was good - for Masao. The feeling of discomfort grew, blossomed, and flared within his chest as his feet drew closer to the shrine. Every instinct in his body told him to bolt into the nearest jungle, to escape Masao's clutches forever. However, the high, veiled forests coldly looked on. They would not help a man escape civilization.\n\nWhen Sakai reached Masao, he found the old commander meditating, his posture cross-legged. Sakai was a courier, a soldier: he had no business kicking a hornet's nest, and so he decided to wait. Standing on the entrance of the shrine awkwardly, he waited until Masao opened his eyes and stood. Sakai called out to him. "Masao-sama." He said. "A message, from the headquarters. A most auspicious piece of news Masao-sama. They will let you stay here for another year."\n\nMasao smiled. "Dismissed. Thank you." Better a quick dismissal than bullying, Sakai supposed. He broke into a run when he saw that Masao had returned to his meditation."

Japan does not stand to benefit from any measures that you propose. We implore you, Takagi-san to take our advice to heart and pull back on these measures."\n\nTakagi had been expecting such a response both from his cabinet and the liberals in general. He sighed. Still, it had come faster than he had expected. "Nakasone," Takagi said, trying to sound as sympathetic as possible, "I know of your concerns. You have not approved of my colonial policies ever since I entered the Diet. I am not a politician by trade, but Japan does stand to benefit if we administer our colonies properly. After all," Takagi smirked, "is not Japan the light of all Asia?"\n\n"Prime Minister, I find that description of the kokutai as insulting. The Japanese people also have their needs, and I cannot approve of measures that squander the hard-earned victories of the Japanese people."\n\n"Of course, of course," Takagi replied, trying to calm Nakasone down. "The Japanese people have their concerns. However, think of it this way, Nakasone. Well-administered colonies would mean a lot less strain on the Home Islands. I trust you understand, for these ideas form a core part of your economic ideas."\n\n"Prime Minister, I-"\n\n"I think we are in agreement," Takagi interrupted. Nakasone backed down.

The faces of everyone he knew slipped away, leaving only hints of seasickness. He was sure that at that moment his face must have been as green as the algae that occasionally drifted beside the ship's hull. Where would he go now, he thought, his thoughts tossing, turning, listing from port to starboard every few minutes.\n\nLooking back on his days on the ship, Hisaguchi would never have thought that he would become the administrator of a portion of Karenko. At first, he had hoped that he would be placed in Tainan, where it was the most Japan-like. Instead, they stuck him in the rural areas, where friction between the local and Japanese customs tempered the dull days spent baking under the sun. He missed winter.\n\nHowever, Hisaguchi struck gold. Tokyo was particularly generous with the distribution of funds for the purposes of "aiding the local populace." At first, Hisaguchi tried to use the money in good faith. He contributed to the electrification of the district in which he resided. However, debt collectors came for him - on his trail for his gambling debts. In desperation, Hisaguchi took the money out of his safety box and waited for retribution.\n\nNothing came. Hisaguchi was happy. From then on, he took the money. At first, it was bit-by-bit, piece-by-piece. Nowadays, Hisaguchi thought of the funds as extra wages for the month.

Masao found it hard to believe that years could pass him by as easily as leaves picked off by the wind. At least his uniform was still in an acceptable condition. Medals gleamed on his chest. He heard a knock on the door. It was time to go.\n\nOutside, crowds of the natives greeted Masao. He got into the car, and the parade began. To his left and right the copper-skinned and sunburnt inhabitants of this place threw out cheers to him, hailing him as a hero, or so he thought. They could have been as easily throwing insults and jeers, happy that the Japanese military governor would be gone, perhaps forever. Masao preferred to look for the silver lining. He would see Japan again. A return to Kumamoto was no longer a dream.\n\nOnce they were out of sight of the crowds, Masao sat down in his car, exhausted, for some reason. His tears welled up. The chauffeur, concerned, leaned back. "Baba-sama," he said, "are you all right?"\n\nThe words that came out sounded broken, the voice of no hero."

It was the kind of cheap trash that young men and women read in stacks these days, but whatever. He noted the title. Maybe Headquarters was looking for a survey on the youth's interests in literature.\n\nThen, an acquaintance! He set himself down on a chair opposite to her, and spoke. Of what?

It's golden feathers shimmered in the slithers of sunlight that reached into the classroom, and flapped around her face to cause her to panic and drop her cane. She darted over the floor to grab the stick to attack the bird, and in that moment, the crying boy leapt from her lap and scurried out of the classroom, still glossy-eyed and sore from her punishments.\n\nWith the shrieking of the classroom still audible to the boy, he dashed down to the beachfront to escape his teacher's abuse and play in the sand. As the fresh, salty air blew on his face, he felt the energy to run into the sunlit shore and wash his feet in the foamy waters. He felt the fresh brush of the sea between his small toes and the small pebbles beneath his soles.
