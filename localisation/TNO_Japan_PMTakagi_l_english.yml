 JAP_takagi_prime_minister_takagi_desc:0 "마침내, 익찬회의 자유화를 위한 우리 개혁주의자들이 결실을 맺었습니다. 타카기 소키치는 정부를 구성할 수 있는 충분한 국회 내 지지를 확보했고, 이제 그의 임무가 일본과 공영권이 볼 수 있도록 제시될 것입니다. 제독의 약속에 따라 심각한 부패, 정부의 권력남용, 과도한 군국주의의 시대는 지나갈 것입니다.\n\n그러나 모든 개혁에 신중을 가해야 합니다. 즉, 일본 국가 장치는 다루기 힘든 짐승이고 만약 걸려 넘어지면 심하게 넘어질 것입니다. 그러나 만약 제독이 올바른 방법을 구사하고 언제 어디서 전투를 벌여야 할지 안다면, 우리는 과거의 지나침을 없애는 일본 사회의 장기적인 개혁의 시작을 볼 수 있을 것입니다."
 JAP_new_beginning:0 "익찬회의 새로운 시작"
 JAP_new_beginning_desc:0 "대정익찬회는 엄청나게 거대하고, 느릿느릿하며, 융통성이 없는 정치 조직의 짐승이며, 보수파에서 혁신관료에 이르기까지 무수한 파벌로 얽혀 있으며 항상 무소속 파벌이 반대하고 있습니다. 불행하게도, 이 단체는 일본 내에서 유일한 합법적인 정당이며, 국회의원의 대다수는 합법적인 당원들입니다. 제독의 정권이 들어서기 위해서는 익찬회의 약점을 이용해야 하고 자신들의 이익을 위해 약점을 이용해야 할 것입니다. 아마도 더 빡빡한 배를 운행하는 것이 귀족원의 자신감을 높여줄 것이고, 결국 우리에게 큰 도움이 될 것입니다."
 JAP_problem_sectarianism:0 "파벌주의의 문제점"
 JAP_problem_sectarianism_desc:0 "익찬회는 단순한 통제불능의 짐승이 아니라 서로 반대되는 자유파, 보수파, 혁신관료, 무소속과 같이 4개의 파벌로 구성된 히드라입니다. 무엇보다도 군부의 지휘관이 우리 머리 위에 남아 있습니다.\n\n그러나 우리는 누구에게 호소할 것인지, 그리고 국회에서 어떤 역할을 하는지 선택함으로써 이러한 내분을 이용할 수 있습니다. 바라건대, 올바른 방법으로 올바른 접근에 집중함으로써 우리는 국회 내의 파벌주의를 반대파들과 맞서게 하고, 우리의 이익을 위해 바꿀 수 있기를 바랍니다.\n\n그렇다면 우리가 누구와 연합을 맺어야 하고, 누구를 개들에게 맡길 지 결정하는 것이 가장 중요할 것입니다. 그것을 대충 설명하자면, 우리가 가진 모든 차이점들에도 불구하고 이케다의 보수파는 우리에게 기울어질 가능성이 높습니다. 왜냐하면 보수파와 자유파는 예측불허의 급진적인 키도파와 혁신관료들에 비하면 온건하기 때문입니다."
 JAP_cooperation_and_compromise:0 "협력과 타협"
 JAP_cooperation_and_compromise_desc:0 "우리는 국회 내의 다른 파벌들에 대해 더 가벼운 손을 내미는 동시에 국회 밖에서 우리 파벌의 지지자들의 이상주의를 활용 할 수 있습니다. 이를 위해 우리는 다른 의원들의 호의를 바탕으로 협력과 타협의 렌즈를 통해 우리의 개혁주의를 촉진시킬 것입니다. 그러나 일부 개혁에 영향을 줄 것입니다. 우리가 이 길을 가려면 다른 파벌들의 조율에 더 가깝게 따라가야 할 것입니다."

 JAP_reconciling_and_reformism_desc:0 "우리 파벌과 혁신관료들은 일본이 개혁과 조정이 필요하고 그렇게 하지 않다면 일본이 사라진다고 보는 요소들은 겹치는 관점입니다. 그러나, 우리가 행동하고자 하는 방법과 지향하는 목표에 있어서 혁신관료들과 크게 다릅니다.\n\n국가장치의 합리화 같은 혁신관료들과 특정한 문제들을 타협함으로써, 우리는 대부분의 온건 혁신관료들과 심지어 몇몇 기시의 하인들로부터 지지를 끌어낼 수 있을 것입니다. 즉 다시말해 급진적인 구조조정은 위험하여 귀족원의 지지도와 군부의 분노와 같은 대가를 치르게 될 것입니다."
 JAP_unified_resistance:0 "Unified Resistance"
 JAP_unified_resistance_desc:0 "We could play to some of the more independent-minded Reform Bureaucrats' opposition to Ino and Ikeda's conservatives and the military. No matter how disparate our means and ends, we can both benefit by promoting a united front within the Diet. This would, of course, shake up the political scene within the Diet massively - such a large, tenuous front would definitely result in disagreement and clashes over policy, but right now it would be better to drive the conservatives out, then sort out our differences later."
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy:0 "Continuing the Legacy"
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy_desc:0 "The Admiral's grand scheme of reform and liberalisation is not a new one. In fact, one could argue that it is a return to the status quo of Emperors Meiji and Taisho, a careful balance between freedom and restraint, between traditional values and foreign ones. We could therefore leverage the positive aspects of the Meiji and Taisho eras and project the Admiral's administration as a continuation of those eras.\n\nNo doubt, promoting our reforms as such would appeal to the more cautious and hardline members of the Diet as well as the nobility within the House of Peers, but most importantly it will keep us in a safe zone with the public by appealing to a time and ethos lost to the excesses of militarism."
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai:0 "Appealing to the Kokutai"
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai_desc:0 "In addition to appealing to the legacy of the glorious times of Emperors Meiji and Taisho, we could present our administration as a means to strengthen the Kokutai - the national polity and the essence of Japanese sovereignty, as well as the rightful means through which our society should be governed.\n\nThis could be achieved by presenting our reformist efforts as a return to older times, strengthening our purity, overcoming social unrest, and bringing forth a new golden era for Japan as per the Kokutai No Hongi, while at the same time discrediting the excesses of the militarists and the conservatives."
 JAP_strength_and_totality:0 "Strength and Totality"
 JAP_strength_and_totality_desc:0 "Of course, we could also try to project our faction as one that is able to blaze its own path - Japan needs reform, and continuing on the path set by the conservatives will ensure that the Kokutai will be sullied, stripped of what makes it important to the Japanese national sovereignty.\n\nNot everyone in the Diet, nor the House of Peers would be happy with this however, but without being weighed down by backroom deals, we would be more free to determine the extent and totality of our intended reforms."
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned:0 "Appeal to the Disillusioned"
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned_desc:0 "To begin this path of coalition building, we could pick off at the edges and the scraps of the Diet. In particular, we could arrange for the incorporation of reform bureaucrats disillusioned or in disagreement with the path Kishi and Kaya has set for them. In addition, Ino's grand coalition of conservatives is a labyrinthine organisation bound to contain at the very least, a few dissidents. Lastly, we can incorporate some of the more independent-minded members of the Diet, particularly those who have grown tired and sick of factionalism. One by one, we will work our way towards garnering a majority to reliably pass our reformist bills."
 JAP_solidify_base:0 "Solidify Our Base"
 JAP_solidify_base_desc:0 "With the disillusioned and more easily convinced members of the Diet under our wing, we will now be able to focus on solidifying the liberal camp within the diet. A few dinner parties here, and a few fishing trips and yacht vacations there, and we may be well on our way to ensure that our reformist angle gets pushed, voted and ratified with comfortable majorities and margins.\n\nOf course, the stronger our bloc becomes, the risk of the reform bureaucrats, conservatives and the military riling up support against us would be exponentially larger, but only time can tell whether blazing our own path is the best decision we could have made."
 JAP_end_siege_mentality:0 "End the Siege Mentality"
 JAP_end_siege_mentality_desc:0 "The riches and prosperity of our nation have indeed been forged through war, and for the past twenty years, a culture of militarism, hostility, and xenophobia has permeated our nation from top to bottom. From the riots against Korean labour in our cities, to our perennial itchy Daihon'ei's trigger finger, it has made itself constantly known. This may suit the mechanisms of a war-bound state, but we are no longer in such a position.\n\nTo this end, we will define our platform as such - the promotion of peace, prosperity and openness, not only within Japan itself, but to the world as a whole. This will be unpopular with some factions, no doubt, but it will bring forth a new era of open, transparent government."
 JAP_appropriating_reformism:0 "Appropriating Reformism"
 JAP_appropriating_reformism_desc:0 "The Reform Bureaucrats are an incredibly powerful faction in the Diet, and oppose Ino and Ikeda's conservatives as strongly as we do. The problem is, they have an incredibly different interpretation of how the state apparatus should be defined, reformed and restructured.\n\nWhile we are no friend to their pretenses of a National Defence State, we could take the wind out of their sails by co-opting some of their less radical nationalisation plans - not the least of which includes nationalisation of key sectors and curtailing the influence of the Zaibatsu."
 JAP_beginning_second_phase:0 "Beginning the Second Phase"
 JAP_beginning_second_phase_desc:0 "Now that our liberalising bloc proper has solidified its ranks and its internal structure, the Admiral can move on to the next phase of our power consolidation, namely how to deal with Ikeda and Kido's strongholds proper, instead of merely picking off their scraps. We could either choose to formally acquiesce to Kido and Ikeda's compromises, or alternatively we could sideline them in favour of our own bloc taking the lead."
 JAP_coalition_equals:0 "A Coalition of Equals"
 JAP_coalition_equals_desc:0 "Entering a proper coalition with Ikeda and Kido would be the safer route for our bloc to survive in the Diet - a broad, united front against the militarists and the hardliners. While this might be better for our long-term survival, it almost certainly means that we would have to water down our reformist policies.\n\nThe very least it could do is that Ikeda's gargantuan bloc would almost certainly ensure a sufficient majority for us to pass our bills. However, we may end up in a position where we concede too much in exchange for too little."
 JAP_settling_differences:0 "Settling Our Differences"
 JAP_settling_differences_desc:0 "The differences between our liberal bloc, the conservatives, and Kido's royalists are vast - from economics, to militarism, and even to how we ought to govern the vast prosperity and riches of the Sphere. However, for our coalition to push forward with our reforms and to put an end to the influence of the militarists, we have to unite in our common opposition to the excesses of the military and the Ino administration - even at the cost of some of our more radical reforms.\n\nWith this in mind, we can finally start to expand our grand coalition to include not only our liberals but also those conservatives who still possess dignity and the royalists."
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue:0 "Ending Sectarian Intrigue"
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue_desc:0 "Backroom deals, personal favours, internal politicking. blackmail, bribery. These were the means through which everything was done during the Ino administration. It is a way of doing things that the Admiral detests, as it leads to a lack of transparency, corruption, and administrative chaos.\n\nTo this end, the Admiral and his closest advisors will scour the histories of some of our deputies that have histories of dirty politicking and corruption, starting with the most flagrant offenders. They will have no choice but to comply, as our soon-to-be-majority in the Diet will ensure the deaths of their political careers if they resist."
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda:0 "Collaborate with Ikeda"
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda_desc:0 "Masanosuke Ikeda is an implacable man - a strict conservative, a man with a temper, and most importantly, the leader of the most powerful faction in the Diet. While our liberals and their conservatives may not get along on all policy-related fronts, by this point we are united in the purpose of curtailing the Reform Bureaucrats and the Militarists.\n\nWe will proceed to seek his cooperation in the Diet to pass some crucial legislation pertaining to the curtailing of militarism, a relatively secure platform following which we can move on to more... crucial matters."
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido:0 "Rehabilitate Kido"
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido_desc:0 "Koichi Kido is a man with a mixed legacy. On the one hand, our liberalizing cause has taken cues from his planned depoliticization of the military after the War. On the other hand, he left office in a dismal state, with heavy disapproval from the Militarists and Reform Bureaucrats. Now he has sought cooperation with our faction in the Diet, and it would be ridiculous to not take up his offer - his connections with the Imperial Family and the House of Peers will be crucial in shoring up support.\n\nIn exchange, it would be wise for the Admiral to rehabilitate his image. This can be achieved by acknowledging his efforts in Diet speeches, Yokusankai gazettes, and newspaper interviews. Hopefully, the old man will live to see his redemption in the eyes of the Japanese people."
 JAP_accessing_our_coalition:0 "Accessing Our Coalition"
 JAP_accessing_our_coalition_desc:0 "There were many who had doubts about forming a coalition with Masanosuke Ikeda and his clique. This is understandable, given our own origin as a breakoff from the conservatives, but now it would seem that the alliance was a wise move. Through Prime Minister Takagi's capable leadership, the coalition has far exceeded expectations. We have largely kept the conservatives in check, and their connections to various economic and societal institutions have made them particularly useful for advancing our mandate. The coalition has also assisted us in maintaining civility in the Imperial Diet as well as keeping the civilian population happy. These are early days however, and it remains to be seen just how prosperous our collaboration with Ikeda can make Japan. There is always more work to be done."
 JAP_takagi_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
 JAP_takagi_on_our_own_desc:0 "Of course, we could leave cooperation with the other factions to the wind and blaze our own path. This would allow us to have free rein in enacting our reformist policies, but will naturally leave us vulnerable to losing on numbers in the Diet.\n\nGoing down this path would involve strong-arming some factions and locking up others in a corner so that they'll have no means of weaseling out of a deal with us, and will inevitably draw the ire of some of the....less persuadable members of the Diet."
 JAP_piecemeal_compromises:0 "Piecemeal Compromises with the Reformists"
 JAP_piecemeal_compromises_desc:0 "The Reform Bureaucrats, as a group, represent the staunchest opposition to our liberal movement. Ironically, some of the individual members of reformists also happen to be most susceptible to compromise with our faction, as lame-toothed as the results may be. However, given the strength of our bloc, we do not need to compromise too much on our key policies.\n\nWe could take advantage of some of the places we can find common ground, such as mild nationalization in unimportant sectors or the forced restructuring of minor Zaibatsu holdings overseas, all hopefully curtailing corporate power in favour of the state apparatus. In the end, this will only serve to keep some of the Reform Bureaucrats sated, and prevent them from forming a solid front against us."
 JAP_strengthening_our_agreements:0 "Strengthening Our Agreements"
 JAP_strengthening_our_agreements_desc:0 "Our reformist cause mainly draws its strength from two wildly divergent factions: the students and the Imperial Navy. While both bases of support agree on what the end goals of the Admiral's administration should be, it is still largely an alliance of convenience, only united by a shared desire to end the excesses of the Ino era.\n\nBy publishing gazettes and interviews as well as holding further talks and discussions with the representatives of our support bases, we will be able to connect the disparate interests of our public supporters into a formidable popular backing for our legislation, and hopefully we can take the wind out of the sails of other diet factions' popular support."
 JAP_merging_ikedas_camp:0 "Merging Ikeda's Camp"
 JAP_merging_ikedas_camp_desc:0 "Masanosuke Ikeda is an implacable man - a strict conservative, a man with a temper, and most importantly, the leader of the most powerful faction in the Diet. At least, that was the situation a few weeks ago, before the downfall of the Ino administration and the subsequent weakening of the conservatives and strengthening of our liberals.\n\nBy boxing Ikeda and his faction into a corner, we can easily ensure his cooperation. The Admiral can convince him that cooperation with us is the only way to remain relevant in the Diet - the consequences of not doing so would be opening up a window for the Reform Bureaucrats, which is an outcome less than desirable for any of us, let alone a crumbling bloc such as Ikeda's conservatives"
 JAP_incorporate_kido:0 "Incorporate Kido"
 JAP_incorporate_kido_desc:0 "Koichi Kido is a man with a mixed legacy. On one hand, our liberalising cause has indeed taken cues from his planned depoliticisation of the military after the War. On the other hand, he left office dismally, with heavy disapproval from the Militarists and the Reform Bureaucrats. However, it would be ridiculous for us to not incorporate a man of his caliber.\n\nWhile his faction may be the smallest in quantity, cooperation with Kido provides us with an ace up our sleeve - access to the Imperial Family and the House of Peers, which will provide us with a necessary leverage in the event of any deadlock within the diet, as well as leveraging on the personal counsel of the Emperor himself, if need be."
 JAP_dealing_with_others:0 "Dealing with the Others"
 JAP_dealing_with_others_desc:0 "Previously, we have worked hard to prove ourselves as a capable, fair and assertive government. Our success in doing so has greatly boosted our popularity with the general public. As our popularity has soared, the reputations of the other factions in the Imperial Diet have been diminished somewhat. If we are to earn a reputation as the only viable and respectable form of government, then we must do more to dampen the opposition's status.\n\nThe Prime Minister has ordered a full scale campaign to portray the other cliques as corrupt, ineffectual, and dangerous. There is no need for any fabrication to complete this task. We have acquired plenty of evidence that only needs to be shown to the public in the right light. At the same time, the public will be made aware of just who the other cliques associate with, to make their true allegiances clear. Let it be known that the opposition can only offer the Japanese Empire a humiliating decline into obscurity."
 JAP_the_sun_rises_once_more:0 "The Sun Rises Once More"
 JAP_the_sun_rises_once_more_desc:0 "By now, we have solidified political control, made inroads towards ending corruption, ended the siege mentality in Japanese society, and curbed the excesses of wartime. The future is bright, and it is a future paved by the Admiral's hand. We will now move towards the economic side of things, where we shall concentrate on the tuning of our economy and research into the development of a proper technocracy - a future of merit, hard work, and professionalism, all imbued with the essence of the Kokutai, of course."
 JAP_push_for_normalcy:0 "Push for Normalcy"
 JAP_push_for_normalcy_desc:0 "Our greatest national triumph occurred nearly twenty years ago, when we triumphed over the United States and their imperialist allies. However, it seems as if the cumbersome administrations which preceded us have failed to acknowledge the fact that the war is over, and many wartime laws and policies remain a part of Japanese life even now.\n\nThis presents several issues, as the inefficiencies and rigidity of wartime mobilisation have lasted well into the present and prevent us from making full use of the economic benefits and privileges that the Sphere provides. Most importantly, dissent is growing as our citizenry's material needs increase - a problem we need to curtail if our administration is to proceed with any semblance of a popular mandate.\n\nMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone has come up with a grand plan to gradually dismantle wartime restrictions, all so Japan can benefit from the full strength of market forces, of course."
 JAP_curtail_wartime_privileges:0 "Curtail Wartime Privileges"
 JAP_curtail_wartime_privileges_desc:0 "The Zaibatsu and Keiretsu have enjoyed close cooperation with the state ever since the industrialisation of Japan in the late 19th century - a relationship which we would be wise to maintain positively, even amidst our liberalisation programs. However, it is also undeniable that wartime contracts and subsidies have taken a decent toll on our balance of payments, putting our fiscal situation in dangerous zones if we don't watch our step.\n\nHence, it would be necessary for us to terminate some of the more....outrageous wartime subsidies and contracts - ostensibly a means to improve our balance of payments, but it would be a step in the right direction to start dismantling the incredible grip the Zaibatsu and Keiretsu have over our stagnating economy."

 JAP_grease_the_gears_desc:0 "Deregulation is a fickle mistress, and the gradual dismantlement of decades-old cartels is an extremely risky exercise. However, we could gradually convince them that privatization would be ideal both from the perspective of national interests and firm profitability. To this end, Minister Nakasone will meet with officials from the zaibatsu and keiretsu, specifically outlining the increases in profitability in the long run as firms slide back from diseconomies of scale.\n\nOf course, if these firms cannot be persuaded with logic and mathematics (and the very generous private R&D research grants), there might be more under-the-table means of making the firms bend to our administration's will.\n\nNo matter - Minister Nakasone is an expert in the field of economics and negotiation with the corporate giants, and we would be wise to entrust him with the necessary means to accomplish this."
 JAP_easing_nationalization:0 "Easing Nationalization"
 JAP_easing_nationalization_desc:0 "While negotiations with firms themselves would be a tricky affair, our administration will have a freer hand in easing the nationalization of assets and firms which are already under government control. Cutting away unprofitable assets would be a good start, especially ones in far-flung regions such as Central China and the South Pacific.\n\nIn addition, chipping away at the Sangyo Hokokukai to chip away at the legacy of the National Mobilization Law would also increase our standing with the corporations - with no union dues to increase labor costs, even though the Sangyo Hokokukai is merely a puppet.\n\nWhile this move would increase the support we receive from private businesses, it would definitely draw the ire of the military and the Reform Bureaucrats, who would definitely be opposed to the loosening of the state's grip over industries and assets."
 JAP_privatize_the_railways:0 "Privatize the Railways"
 JAP_privatize_the_railways_desc:0 "When peace returned to the Pacific, it provided us with an opportunity to consolidate our holdings throughout not only Korea and Taiwan but also the rest of the Sphere. To that end, old administrations engaged in widespread state-owned railway construction, largely to feed the needs of the military. As it is with most of our current economic woes, these assets have largely failed to be profitable.\n\nWhile privatizing the entire railway network would be unwise considering the military importance of many of the lines, we could start to make inroads into privatization within Japan itself. Minister Nakasone has a plan, namely to use the Tokyo inner-city underground metropolitan system as a guinea pig for large-scale privatization in the future."
 JAP_returning_seized_assets:0 "Returning Seized Assets"
 JAP_returning_seized_assets_desc:0 "The industrial centers of Western Japan have been the backbone of our industry, especially in the automotive and electronics industries. However, they are a drain on our state coffers, so privatizing some of these industries would be a good way to facilitate greater economic liberalization. Furthermore, it is a good opportunity for us to see the effects of privatization when applied to the unique contexts of Japan.\n\nWhile we may run into opposition from the Reform Bureaucrats, some of whom have argued that the automotive and electronic industries are still "essential" industries, our support from the moderates within the Diet should be enough to overwhelm their opposition. This move wouldn't hurt our standing with our zaibatsu allies such as Mitsubishi, either."
 JAP_remove_the_barriers_on_trading:0 "Remove the Barriers on Trading"
 JAP_remove_the_barriers_on_trading_desc:0 "The Co-Prosperity Sphere, while designed to foster Asian economic development (naturally, under our very close oversight) is still very much facing wartime restrictions courtesy of previous administrations. Moreover, some local army garrisons have vested interests in ensuring their chokeholds through black market dominance and off-the-books provisions remain untouched. While this benefits the pockets of individuals, it does not benefit Japan - in fact, it hurts our ability to placate the populace of the Sphere's member states.\n\nHence, our cabinet has proposed to lift wartime trading and resource restrictions in order to facilitate a liberalised flow of goods and capital - allowing for our businesses to thrive and fully capitalise on the immense resource wealth the Sphere offers. From Beijing to Bengkulu, Japanese business will flourish - and so will the Japanese people."
 JAP_keep_hold_of_key_industries:0 "Keep Hold of Key Industries"
 JAP_keep_hold_of_key_industries_desc:0 "While the long-term goal of the Admiral's administration should be the greater liberalization of the Japanese economy, liberalizing too many sectors at once would lead to great economic uncertainty and market shocks across the Sphere. Hence, it would be wise for our administration to keep significant shares in several key industries, namely the defense, steel, and petrochemical sectors.\n\nIn addition, Minister Nakasone has a means of keeping the Reform Bureaucrats and the military on our side as we gradually liberalize more and more of our economy, namely an increase in the production capabilities of the aforementioned industries through increased R&D into new technologies, such as automation and line production, influenced by the efficiency of Toyota's production methods. Turning the Reform Bureaucrats' principles against them in our management of the economy could also do well to take the wind out of their sails."
 JAP_maintain_resource_dominance:0 "Assert Resource Dominance"
 JAP_maintain_resource_dominance_desc:0 "Alternatively, we could focus on keeping the state's fingers in the resource extraction industry's proverbial pie instead. It's a less risky move than further privatization: the state already controls a more significant amount of the resource extraction industry's assets and is guaranteed a near-monopoly on extraction in remote areas, such as the South Pacific and Outer Manchuria.\n\nOf course, total state control would be undesirable for us in the long run, hence the need for Minister Nakasone to come up with contingency plans with the zaibatsu officials. The zaibatsu would be tacitly given priority in future privatization biddings and use their expertise to help with any current state expansion."

From the coal mines of Kyushu to Nissan's factories in Manchuria, labor - forced and participatory - has been crucial to the betterment of the Japanese economy and people. However, with a modernizing economy comes a new challenge for our labor pool - mechanization and automation necessitates a greater need to modernize the skills of our labor pool.\n\nWe could consider the reduction of our reliance on forced labor, simultaneously reducing the dissent within the Sphere and improving our public image both within Japan and without. We should not keep our fingers out of requisitioned labour entirely - their contributions to jobs the average Japanese person would not touch are still crucial, for the time being. In addition, keeping labor costs on the low end definitely wouldn't hurt our standing with the zaibatsu and keiretsu. After all, with the presence of our security forces, striking laborers will have little luck or leverage."

Their triumphs are signs of Japan's economic prowess and prosperity. In turn, however, they also need to be fed themselves with a steady diet of labor and natural resources. Allowing the zaibatsu and keiretsu to maintain their free hand over labor requisitioning across the Sphere would definitely keep our administration in their good books in addition to maintaining the temporary approval of the conservatives.\n\nThis would not look good in the eyes of the public, though. The progressives wish to curtail the usage of forced labor, and the ultranationalists wish for the state to have a greater say in the usage of forced labor. In addition, we also could run into the risk of angering our collaborators within the Sphere - exploitation of their people for our own gain is not the most ideal or agreeable thing there is."

We have spent a good deal of time ensuring that the industry of the Home Islands operates according to the highest of standards. New safety measures have been implemented, including through examinations of machines and tools before use and intensive training to better handle workplace accidents. Much work has also been done to ensure the industrial sector operates with full energy and production efficiency.\n\nWhile our efforts at home have proved fruitful, the new practices have yet to be implemented across the Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is now time to do just that. Once all of Asia utilises our new methods, the Sphere will see a leap of economic progress."

Socially, Japan has been stagnating due to the effects of wartime laws; a siege mentality permeating Japanese society has prevented its best and brightest from shining, trapped in a vicious cycle of insurgencies and conscription. In addition, while we have won the war and claimed our mantle as the liberator of East Asia, the Japanese people have not benefited from the fruits of the Sphere.\n\nHence, with our majority in the Diet secured and with sufficient backing from the House of Peers, the Admiral will make moves to restore normalcy in the Home Islands, starting with mobilization laws and then moving on to further economic and social deregulation. A bold step forward, this would definitely make waves among our popular support base, but it will also definitely earn the ire of the militarists and the bureaucrats."

While necessary twenty years ago, it has long since stopped being relevant. In particular, the Law focuses on several key sectors of Japanese society: labor unions, nationalisation of strategic industries, price controls, rationing, curfews, and media censorship, the continuation of all of which is a stranglehold on Japanese society.\n\nWe could once again push for a gradual easing of the National Mobilization Law, attacking it from the angle of unconstitutionality the way the House did nearly thirty years ago, or we could attack it from the angle of economics and financial prudence - loosening regulations and privatizing assets would do the treasury good in the long term.\n\nEither way, we must dismantle the act and then rebuild Japanese society."

Through the Chuo Bukka Tosei Kyoryoku Kaigi, wartime price floors and ceilings have ensured tighter government control over the prices of essential goods, but in the process have also inevitably created black markets both in rural and urban areas, proliferating crime.\n\nIn addition, the presence of price controls have also created a resource crisis within our military and defense industries as the Army and Navy compete for raw materials such as aluminium, which is also having adverse effects on civilian industry.\n\nWhile dismantling the legislation itself would be a fairly straightforward task, given the support from both the conservatives and the Kidoites, we would also have to dedicate police and Kempeitai resources to tracking and shutting down black markets."

The continued fear of reprisals and prosecution from the Tokko have generated an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, fomenting unrest among our populace.\n\nIt would be wise for us to ease the punishment clauses, the result of which would be a definite boost to our approval amongst the public. The Tokko resources and manpower that could be freed from a relaxed policy at home could be better deployed overseas, especially in Manchukuo and China.\n\nOnce this return to normalcy is complete, Japanese society will flourish in the material and spiritual glory of our place in the sun and achieve the desired balance between freedom to flourish and respect for the rule of law."

While rightfully stifled by the National Mobilization Law through distribution and licensing restrictions, we could look into easing some of these press regulations if we wanted to.\n\nNaturally, we should be able to shore up our public support through easing these press regulations, but there is also a second, less apparent purpose in deregulating the press: namely the purpose of weaponizing it against our opponents in the diet, be it through candid interviews, honest audits of corruption, or even some... sensationalized news pieces.\n\nAfter all, media coverage and exposure is a double-edged sword."

The expansion of the Education Ministry would be focused on increasing educational quality and training, especially in rural areas, as well as branching out to Japanese communities throughout the Sphere so that these loyal sons and daughters of Nihon could be on par with their compatriots back home.\n\nIn addition, we would also spare some expenses for a commission to rejuvenate the national syllabi to fit the renewed strength and totality of Japan in this post-war era."

All this is a new, benevolent form of positive propaganda which portrays the Pan-Asian ideal - hopefully this will help calm dissent amongst our population."

Starting from our own citizens, we ought to redefine the national syllabi to include lessons about the benevolence ofJapan towards the Sphere and how Pan-Asianism can only be achieved through Japan's leadership.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Education is also looking at the possibility of increasing overseas education investments - provided that they allow Japanese educators to hold advisory roles in redefining and implementing compulsory education.

After all, fewer people in the military equates to more people in vocational schools and more skilled workers for the labor pool.\n\nOf course, to reach a compromise with the hardliners and perhaps even the Admiral himself, conscription laws will not be entirely abolished - Japan needs a strong military still, especially amidst the uncertainty in the global geopolitical atmosphere as of late."

Where once, the young and inspired Japanese youth would be sent off to serve in Imperial Armed Forces, many are now able to dedicate themselves to improving Japan through science, emerging industries, and new technologies. Relaxations on criminal law and press restrictions have eased the fears of the populace, especially for those who remember the days of the Taisho era.\n\nWhile these very palpable changes are significant, especially for the general population, we cannot now lie back and consider our own work done.

One choice of where to start is to target the military, its various overseas holdings, and members of the reformist faction. Our other choice is to investigate the conservative and liberal sections of the Imperial Diet as well as a number of government-controlled ports and warehouses.

In fact, many an impoverished noble has been known to sell their political integrity in order to gain any amount of yen. That is not to say that wealthy nobles are exempt from this behaviour. Indeed, many of their number are just as guilty. This can go on for no longer. The upper house of the imperial diet cannot be allowed to be a nest of corruption any longer.

Many use their yen to live out their days in prison in relative comfort. Others have used their ill-gotten money to escape our reach. It is time that we cut them off from their power.\n\nNow, the money that they never should have accepted in the first place will be given to the state. We are sure that we can put it to better use, anyways. Without their grafts, the recently imprisoned businessmen and officials are sure to suffer the consequences of their crimes to the fullest.

Despite the inconsistent nature of their political existence, independent leader Takeo Miki is clamoring about electoral fraud.

We care little for the fate of the non-endorsed, but this is a way to set us apart from the rest of the YSK. As tedious as the Prime Minister might find the independents, he has chosen to pardon their imprisoned brethren. This will certainly irritate the rest of our party, but not without carrying a reward.

Unlike factions of the YSK, who were at least willing to subject themselves to audits for appearances' sake, the independents are fiercely distrustful of us. They see any attempt to investigate them as us an attempt to stifle their limited influence. Yet as many of the independents are immensely wealthy figures, such as Ryoichi Sasakawa, it would be wise to examine their finances.

However, the days when Japanese Communist Party posed a threat are long gone, and there has been little in the way of ideological resistance to our rule since the war.\n\nThe Tokko spend most of their time in the present intimidating non-endorsed politicians, particularly during elections. This is by no means a secret to the general public, who see the Tokko as a stain upon the nation's claim to democractic rule. The Prime Minister therefore wishes to reduce the role of the Tokko, keeping them away from public eyes. If they are doing more harm than good, then he thinks it best that they be kept on a much shorter leash."'

The Prime Minister intends to remedy this error through simple, yet significant reform. Firstly, more training will be given to poll organisers to assist them in dealing with long queues and confused citizens.

The Prime Minister, an admiral in the IJN, is well aware of the danger that the army can pose when riled up. Former Prime Minister Kido knows that perhaps more than anyone. Therefore, Prime Minister Takagi will pursue a careful and protracted investigation into the corruption of the IJA. Before anything else, we will examine the payrolls of several high ranking members of the army. These are military governors, generals and other figures who often find themselves in contact with politicians and businessmen. If anyone in the army is receiving suspiciously generous wages, it will be them."

Certain whispers have also reached our ears, suggesting that the navy may be misusing their extensive funds. Prime Minister Takagi has managed to convince enough of the admirals to allow for an audit of their budget, to root out any financial sinkholes. At the same time, we will be searching for any traces of corruption that the budget might hint at.

In the wider Sphere, the army is cut loose to do as they please, much to the chagrin of anyone not in their good graces. Prime Minister Takagi's efforts to eliminate corruption have so far been mostly limited to the Home Islands. It would be wise to examine the situation in the colonies as well, as the army is surely commiting worse crimes outside of Japan.

A great deal of territory and resources had been handed over to them by Prime Minister Ino, which they now cling to dearly.\n\nAlthough we would be fools to entirely trust the colonial administrations to handle themselves, many of the army garrisons do little more than sit in their barracks these days.

By utilizing the Prime Minister's connection in the Navy, we can begin to establish firmer relationships with both branches of the military. This will allow us to properly negotiate, rather than cause a diplomatic meltdown each time we attempt to curtail excess military power. Our allies within the armed forces will ensure that the branches act in a suitable manner. The military will turn its attention to defending our shores from threats from within and without.

Fortunately for us, the civilian administration of Kwantung, the Kanto-Cho, indirectly reports to us through the Ministry of Greater East Asia.\n\nThe Prime Minister has issued a quiet directive to loyalists in Dairen to closely observe any suspicious activities of the IJA.

By reducing the upkeep of these programs and institutions, the government saves money that can re-enter the economy through business initiatives."

With the decline in military spending, it has become unprofitable, a burden to state and people alike. The previous governments have only maintained it out of respect to the past, but in that time, it has driven deep cuts into the nation's revenue.\n\nAs part of the large-scale privatization effort, Nakasone has personally promised Takagi that through use of Takagi's influence in the navy, he can ensure that Showa Steel is not only privatized, but that it will offer itself up for privatization.

As a result, the government enters debt for those who are only a drain on society.\n\nFiscal responsibility shall be the keyword of Prime Minister Takagi's economic policy. The citizens of Japan pay their taxes every year, and therefore the government should answer to them and them only. The government shall be cut, cut, cut until it reaches a baseline that it is economically sustainable. Only the necessities shall be kept.

Continuing the trend of fiscal responsibility that Nakasone has set, the government shall again cut extraneous expenses and attempt to balance the national budget.

The freer the individual is, the better Japan will be.\n\nYet none in the Diet, not even among the liberals, believe that liberalization will be an easy or straightforward task. The activists, the students, and the media provide the Japanese social landscape with an inherent unpredictability.

For good reason: the liberals and the student movement share many frustrations with the system, however, the reforms must stick - and that is what the government is preparing to do.\n\nThe Admiral instead chooses to interpret the term "winter" differently.

Matters such as pay, social roles, and the recurrent notion that a wife should submit to a husband have damaged the standing of women ever since the Meiji Restoration. Or perhaps a long time before.\n\nMobilizing the female sex into political consciousness shall be Shidzue Kato's policy as a key member of the liberal clique.

The question is, what would come in its place?\n\nSome have suggested the redefining the law to include legalization of abortions - a radical move, but one that will sate the demands of the younger, and more radical protesters.

While the youths generally support the end of sterilisation for patients of leprosy and for inheritable conditions deemed undesirable by the public, Kato herself has been rather tight-lipped over the issue.

After all, no reform bureaucrat is opposed to the creation of new protections, which cannot be said of the conservatives. We would also be increasing our own control of the economy, and hopefully appeasing the protesters. Yet it would be naive to consider this an alliance without potential repercussions.\n\nThere are quite a few Liberals who would raise hell should we align with the Reform Bureaucrats, several of which have cabinet positions.

Therefore, we shall allow the reform bureaucrats to operate as they see fit, within reason. It is even possible that the Prime Minister takes onboard some of their suggestions.

In contrast to a similar proposal by the conservatives, this "technocratic protections bureau" would be granted much more direct authority. While this would certainly ensure the Zaibatsu and Keiretsu behave themselves, the bureau itself might have some issues.\n\nThe Reform Bureaucrats have been very clear that they would be heavily involved with its creation and staffing.

Using the information we gathered with our corruption investigations as well as a few pieces of information gathered by the reform bureaucrats, we should be able to silence the corporations for the near future. It is doubtful that they wish to make their difficult situation any worse.\n\nIt is undeniable that this harsh tactic has gone against some of the principles of the liberal clique, but Prime Minister Takagi releases that this is the right path forward.

Once this is done, it is far more likely that our allies will actively work towards the implementation of the reforms.\n\nThe second part of our plan is just as critical as the fist.

Getting the finance minister has been something of a hassle, but it should be of immense value to our cause. Nakasone, due to his great popularity within corporate circles, is the man with the most sway with the keiretsu in the government. He would be more than capable of cutting a few deals with the right people, in order to get some of the corporations off our backs.

However, the sheer scale of such an operation is nearly impossible for the employees of the ministry of finance to handle at the moment. During this critical phase on the road to enforce protective legislation, it is vital that our bureaucracy can function at utmost effectiveness.

The latter point takes the form of a "Protections Bureau", which would act as a government watchdog, with the power to quickly act upon corporate malpractice and abuse.

 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Choson_Mining_Company:0 "The Choson Mining Operation" 
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Choson_Mining_Company_desc:0 "Our government has been pointed towards possible excavation sites in Northeastern Choson by eager geologists and businessmen. With millions of tonnes of magnesite, tungsten, and many other metals in natural deposits in the Northern mountain ranges, we are presented with the opportunity to expand the mining operations already at work in the colony.\n\nOur potential to rake in immense profits from this operation cannot be ignored, and so we will begin work to extend the projects and fill the mines with workers. Before long, heaps of metals and ores can be exported from the colony and sold throughout the empire, bringing great wealth and investment to the northern corners of Choson."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Railways_In_The_North:0 "Railways In The North"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Railways_In_The_North_desc:0 "Infrastructure in Choson has certainly improved since our annexation in Meiji 43, with railways cutting through the entire colony, but the system has since become over-encumbered and overused. Greater shipments of resources travelling southwards have stressed the railways and often caused major disruptions in logistical organisation across the peninsula. Thus, we find it necessary to direct significant funds to upgrade and expand the railway lines in Choson, with the aim of improving resource extraction and streamlining economic development. With the aid of Japanese engineers, the colony can benefit from our revision of the imperial administrative system."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Suppress_Subversives:0 "Suppress The Subversives"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Suppress_Subversives_desc:0 "Our rule in Choson has been law for over fifty years, but we have been constantly beset by violent guerrillas and bloodthirsty partisans. Scattered and in small pockets, the few yet passionate guerrillas commit acts of terror and banditry in the countryside. We have effectively repressed any and all organised resistance in the colony, but sporadic harassment throughout the colony persists to this day.\n\nIn order to stamp out the violence on the peninsula, Prime Minister Takagi has ordered for an increased Tokko presence in rural regions - upping surveillance and search privileges, and sanctioning lethal force if necessary. We need not worry about appearing as bullies; the Korean terrorists have demonized themselves to the people of Choson already."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Too_Much_At_Once:0 "Too Much At Once"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Too_Much_At_Once_desc:0 "Our plans for Choson and Taiwan, as logical and righteous as they may have seemed, have buckled under the incredible weight of our imperial bureaucracy. Allocated funds have disappeared, and local administrators seem to have pork-barrelled in their own projects in both of our neighboring colonies.\n\nWe have seen very limited successes in this suddenly messy situation, and those few successes have ensnared us with the negative externalities of unemployment and local price inflation we now must churn through. Needless to say, the Prime Minister is very displeased, and our cabinet is at a loss as they attempt to mop up the clutter of our recent failures."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Paving_The_Way:0 "Paving The Way"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Paving_The_Way_desc:0 "Our attempts to reform and strengthen the empire have largely been a success. Our cabinet seems quite pleased with the results of their findings, and the Diet has approved of most of our moves in regards to our Asian holdings. However, our mission is not yet complete; we have achieved much in the name of organisation and planning, and now comes the time to execute what we have spent many tireless days and nights preparing for. We have coordinated with offices and administrations from across the Pacific, and at the behest of the Prime Minister, the next stage of our plans will be set in motion, The Empire shall stand stronger than ever."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Begin_The_Dismantlement_desc:0 "The time has come to withdraw from North Borneo and do away with the millions of yen wasted each year spent supporting a costly military administration over Sarawak. Our ships will arrive soon to relieve General Baba and his men from their posts and return them home, where they will be welcomed as war heroes and patriots. Upon arrival, medals will be awarded, military songs chanted, beautiful girls kissed... and the administration will be dismantled entirely. With the money now safely conserved in our coffers, our government can direct more funding, investment, energy, and attention towards properly developing our mighty empire."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_To_The_Victor:0 "To The Victor Go The Spoils"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_To_The_Victor_desc:0 "With the military administration in Northern Borneo lifted, Malayan, Indonesian, and Filipino emissaries have been invited to discuss the finalization of our plans to divide the land amongst our allies. Accompanied by anthropologists and geological professionals, we welcome the emissaries and settle them into talks over the future of Southeast Asia, in particular, who will get what in the division of the dissolved colony.\n\nWhile disagreement and squabbles might arise over miniscule land disputes between the representatives, the Prime Minister remains charismatic enough to bargain with all three parties and intimidating enough to force them into agreement."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Suppress_Environmentalists:0 "Suppress The Environmentalist Movement"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Suppress_Environmentalists_desc:0 "A movement across Japan has recently surfaced, critical of the increasing industrialization, carbon emissions, and resource extraction across the Sphere. Concerned with the preservation of the natural environment 'now threatened by rising pollution levels', young people fill the streets and universities to spread these lies, poisoning the growing strength of our Empire. Understanding this vocal opposition is key to defeating it. We will begin using interrogation and infiltration as our key tools in stomping out the environmental movement before it can truly undermine our administration's efforts to strengthen the development of Japan."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_New_Britain_New_Dig:0 "New Britain's New Dig"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_New_Britain_New_Dig_desc:0 "With our economic interests firmly anchored in the Melanesian islands, our great resource projects are due to be finalized and then opened to private investment. We expect to rake in enormous streams of revenue and develop the region beyond our original ambition for the isles.\n\nDespite the heaps of cash already flowing into the tropical island, we have yet to announce the opening of an offshore oilfield to drilling contractors eager to make billions from crude oil. The immense wealth-creation in this business is due to bring great riches to the empire and circulate throughout the Sphere, clear proof of Japan's economic might over the Pacific and East Asia."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Colonial_Investments:0 "The Colonial Investments"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Colonial_Investments_desc:0 "The Empire of Japan, mightier and more powerful than ever, stands tall over colonial possessions across the Pacific. From Tokyo, Osaka, and every other major city, investments flow to develop our holdings' infrastructure and economies.\n\nToday, bridges are built, tall buildings are erected, and roads are paved in the name of our achievements in reforming the empire. Jobs are abundant in the Melansian regions, and quality of life is rising. The Prime Minister is applauded for his outstanding successes in developing even the most uncultivated and barren corners of our empire."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Japanisation_Continues:0 "Japanization Continues"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_Japanisation_Continues_desc:0 "Our process of assimilation and civilization in our colonies has proved extremely successful in Choson and Taiwan, and our government is determined to continue the initiative in our Pacific territories. Just as we have industrialized and urbanized Choson and abolished backwards traditions in Taiwan, we will seek to enlighten the peoples of Melanesia by assimilating them into the Japanese way of life.\n\nMore and more Japanese migrate to these colonies, bringing with them our traditions and values; we aim to successfully integrate these native peoples into our customs and raise them from their own indecencies. Indeed, the Empire of Japan leads with an altruistic guidance, determined to lift her subjects from darkness."
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Nihonjinron_Doctrine:0 "The Nihonjinron Doctrine"
 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Nihonjinron_Doctrine_desc:0 "Our government, faced with the challenges of a modern Japan, has developed a vast and sophisticated program of activity across the Co-Prosperity Sphere to build up influence throughout Asia. Broadly, the strategy has two prongs: first, to develop the technological and strategic expertise needed for Japan to maintain its position as a first-rank industrial and military power; second, to assert Japanese economic and cultural leadership around the world, cementing its position as a serious rival to the German and American regimes. Takagi names this the 'Nihonjinron Doctrine' as an expression of Japan's unique cultural and political position in the world, championing this key strategy as the path to international primacy and prestige."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Japanese_Duty_desc:0 "As the shining light of liberation across Asia and the leading beacon of resistance against western aggression, it is the duty of our mighty and just empire to lift our Asian brothers out of poverty and squalor. Just as our great nation modernised in all fields in the Meiji era, we must bring a similar enlightenment to our brother nations across the Sphere so they may also touch greatness. It is the fate of the Empire of Japan to be at the helm of this modern Asian renaissance and to bear witness to the ascension of East Asia to international acclaim."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Education_In_The_Sphere_desc:0 "For the Co-Prosperity Sphere to remain a powerful competitor against her rivals across the globe, the nations under Japan's benevolent watch must be elevated to form a cohesive and fraternal community of peoples. Therefore, we have determined that educational standards across Asia must be improved and that we shall focus on the enlightenment of future generations from Nanjing to Rangoon. With new educational boards, improved teaching methods, and a drive for higher levels of funding for education across the Sphere, we expect to initiate an entire generation of skilled professionals with a schooling that will raise our communities to new heights."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Pan_Asianist_Propganda_desc:0 "The fraternity of nations across Asia has been at the center of our attention since the early Showa era. Millions of men took up arms and gave their lives for the liberation of Asia, and today we live in an age of prosperity which our dead have built for us. With a new generation born after the Greater East Asia War and living free from foreign occupation, it is paramount we do not forget the honor of Pan-Asian brotherhood. Thus, from this day forth, we will remind our children that the peace in Asia was secured under immense pressure and agonizing hardship, and that passionate fraternity between brother nations has brought us liberation from foreign domination."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Investments_In_Azad_Hind_desc:0 "The Azad Hind, our ally in the Indian subcontinent, stands a testament to the virtues of Pan-Asian thought. In this spirit of Pan-Asian fraternity, we have decided to show our patronage and solidarity to our brothers in Bengal. By directing foreign investments, development loans, and other forms of economic assistance to the Government of Free India, we hope to encourage a drive to improve living standards and economic performance. By setting up a strong and reliable Indian ally, our government can retain its Pan-Asian appearance as we aid the brother nations across Asia and also bolster the ranks with another client state subordinate to the Emperor's will."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Middle_East_Beckons_desc:0 "Recent Zaibatsu interest has drawn our government's attention to the Italian corporations in the Persian Gulf, where oil is cheap and luxuries are plenty. In such a small sliver of land with such great, yet untapped potential, economic investment and influence can benefit the Empire of Japan immensely. With Japanese economic ascendency in these markets, the region has the potential to be a key location for our own political interests. Indeed, sinking the teeth of Japanese capital into these markets and anchoring our influence across the Gulf region can extend our influence across the globe, strengthening national competitiveness and building international leverage."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_A_Soft_Victory_desc:0 "Our government has pursued many campaigns and drives internationally to exhibit the cultural capital of Japan as benefactors and patrons of our Asian brothers. Our efforts to aid our allies from Calcutta to Harbin have proved fruitful and ultimately successful in showing the world the generous nature of our Empire. Moreover, with our recent interest and investments outside of the Sphere, our geopolitical muscle is beginning to match our economic might as we continue to leverage our strong cultural assets to improve our overall soft power.

 JAP_TakagiRecon_The_Military_Might_desc:0 "The military, a symbol of the Emperor's peace over Asia, is a sacred institution in Japanese society. From the days of Yamagata to the Great East Asia War, the Japanese military has been characterized as strong, authoritative, and most importantly subordinate to the Emperor.\n\nThundering and determined, the dedication of the military to preserving the Empire is unmatched in intensity and vigor. We cannot let this undying passion go to waste, and showcasing the pride and the image of the Imperial Armed Forces can work in our favor. Exercising the might and will of the Empire of Japan may just be the thing we need to impress our allies and intimidate our foes, humbling all those who dare question our primacy."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Parades_In_Tokyo_desc:0 "In order to maintain the prestige of the Imperial Japanese Army, we must remind the citizens of the Empire of the IJA's vital role in protecting Asia. Many of Tokyo's salarymen, housewives, and students have read of military success and listened to military stories without witnessing the nobility of the institution itself. So, to instill greater pride in the Japanese public, thousands of our brave soldiers will march down the streets of Tokyo, accompanied by marching bands, waving banners, and great cheering crowds. With such marvelous energy and zeal, our soldiers are sure to be hailed as mighty and honorable servants of the Emperor, and the public will cry out with enthusiastic support for our armed forces."

At the order of the Prime Minister, we shall deploy these indomitable fleets across oceans to the four corners of the Pacific, stretching our reach from Fiji to the Bering Straits. As we extend our fleet's reach and project our power across half the globe, the world shall sit and watch as we flex our naval muscles. The shock of artillery fire will tumble through the air as fighters soar off of the deck of colossal aircraft carriers, buzzing across the skies of our conquered oceans. We will show our neighbors that Japan commands the seas, and the Emperor's rule over the oceans shall not be questioned."

 JAP_TakagiRecon_Airbases_On_Midway_desc:0 "Our decision to build airbases on Midway was motivated by aggression from our neighbors across the Pacific. The American, so ignorant and pig-faced, is unable to accept his own negotiated peace. In his own incoherent rattling for war, he calls for an end to the Emperor's peace over these oceans. To defend against this violent irritation, we will construct great airfields and hangars to house entire squadrons of planes to zoom over the vast Pacific skies. With a base in such a central and strategically advantageous position, the Imperial Armed Forces will have the ability to thrash the fool who dares sail into Japanese territory. While we will not shame our people with pointless conflict now, the world shall know that the Empire of Japan will not cower in the face of foreign invasion."

Once a rival and once an ally, both of these adversaries chant for our demise and the end of the Emperor's Peace. Therefore, we have deemed it necessary that our nuclear capabilities to defend Asia be at their peak. We will order the research, development, and deployment of the most modern nuclear weapons technologies across our Empire. We refuse to be held hostage by our enemies' call to war and claims of armament, and so we must unveil our arsenal so that they, too, will consider threats of retaliation and thermonuclear destruction."

Even in relative peace, the glory of our service to the Emperor has been enshrined across the Empire. Children wave imperial banners and crowds cheer upon witnessing the honor of our servicemen defending the Empire and Asia from foreign aggression. A rejuvenated sense of pride shimmers throughout the Empire, and the people rejoice to know our country is not just safe, but prepared to fight in the name of the Emperor if he so wishes. Our great navy crashes through the oceans to guard from foreign invasion, while our men stand proud across the Empire to preserve the existing peace. The flag of the Rising Sun waves higher in the air than ever, not only as a symbol of our nation's pride, but as a reminder to the world that Japan is here to stay."

 jappmtakagi.1.t:0 "The Inauguration of Soukichi Takagi"
 jappmtakagi.1.d:0 "From his distinguished role as the leader of the liberal faction in the Diet, Soukichi Takagi's slow approach to the premiership of the Empire of Japan came swiftly, yet expectedly. His ascendance through the ranks of the Taisei Yokusankai had branded him as a natural leader; stoic and composed, his unwavering commitment to the service of the Emperor had been impressed onto him during his service in the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nHe was dressed in a noble military uniform, decorated with his wartime medals and ribbons. His face was calm and still, respectful of the presence of His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, throughout the ceremony. Takagi did not flinch and moved perfectly, retaining an immaculate composure during his official appointment to the position of Prime Minister; he declared determination to serve the empire to the best of his ability by honoring a righteous and just path for the nation.\n\nFew could warm up to Takagi, and even fewer had seen him smile, but all in the Diet could recall his passionate determination to lift the empire from its economic and political woes and return it to an era of prosperity and security. Now in the Prime Minister's seat, Mr. Takagi seeks to tear the corrupt and decadent camarilla from their elite positions and wipe clean the militarism that festered in the seats of the Diet so that the empire could best enjoy its peaceful reign over Asia."

 jappmtakagi.2.d:0 "The first step was to achieve power, which we have now done, to the surprise and anger of our enemies. There is no time to celebrate our victories, as now we must face the challenges of carrying out our mandate. The number of reforms we must now enact in order to set Japan on the right course are numerous. However, three issues above all must be resolved. The first is that of the infighting between the factions of the YSK. We need to expand our small coalition and improve its resilience against outside attack. Simultaneously, the wider party must be made to submit or comply with our national leadership, whether they like us or not.\n\nThen there is the issue of corruption, which infests every part of Imperial leadership. The state cannot be expected to function if most of its curators and guardians have sold themselves to the highest bidder. The guilty will have to be removed from power before the situation grows even more out of hand.\n\nFinally, the Prime Minister has also spoken of engaging in a series of demilitarization programs across the Sphere. The military apparatus has become bloated and tired, leeching resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. It is time that we showed some trust towards the civilian colonial administrations. If we are to achieve much of anything, then we must act swiftly and decisively."

 jappmtakagi.3.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai is in a sorry state. As the years have gone by, the divides between the party's factions have grown only deeper. Infighting and petty bickering are the norm, and it is sometimes hard to tell that most of the Diet is in fact working under the same banner. Even with a unified support base to back the Prime Minister, we cannot simply ignore the rest of the YSK. Their support will still be necessary upon occasion, so disregarding the remaining conservatives and the reform bureaucrats will be of little gain to us now. They will need to be dealt with, either through compromise and placation or through enforcing our will upon them without restraint. A pair of plans have therefore been put forward by two main branches of Prime Minister Takagi's faction. Koichi Kido, as well as a number of members of the Liberal old guard have backed a series of compromises aimed at winning over more of the opposition within the YSK. They hope to simultaneously pick up the mantle of the conservatives while also appealing to the Reform Bureaucrats desire for extensive change.\n\nThe Liberal New Guard, made up of newer and more radical members of the diet, such as Nakasone Yasuhiro have argued that compromising now would be a grave mistake. Instead, the Prime Minister would be better off leaving his mandate unchanged and instead focus on bringing in more representatives into the liberal cause directly. Now Prime Minister Takagi must select which plan to go forward with."

They rushed to work and later hurried home to their families, making their way to fill their bellies half-full in accordance with the dietary advice from the government. The noise of the city was lively, and the orange evening sky draped the isles in a warm comfort that the limited gas supplies could not provide.\n\nThe familiar scurry for house keys lost in the deep pockets of coats was a daily routine, one that eventually opened up his small home to a family, a bed, and rationed food. Birdsong would wake him up each morning, but he would only leave for work once the nighttime curfew had lifted. Mr. Kobayashi would be sure to try and buy his son candy on the way home, though none for himself, as prices for imports had danced in and around 'too expensive'.\n\nNormal life was said to have already returned to Japan, but it was far beyond the reach of the average citizen. Hidden behind the veil of 'National Security' and dire circumstances, these tight protocols had chained society away from healthy, happy lives. The peace had arrived, yet Japan did not live comfortably in her triumphs, suffering for a war that they were no longer fighting. The Zaibatsus grew fat from their profits, and the Imperial Navy sailed the seas, but Mr. Kobayashi often went to bed hungry, his wife angry and his children bored."

 jappmtakagimil.2.d:0 "The ornate room, filled with the shuffling of paper and the greetings of representatives, came to a sudden halt when the Prime Minister took to the floor. Even after decades on the battlefields of Tokyo's government, the old admiral still carried the aura of dignity and sharpness all men have in their younger years. He stood in front of the Imperial Diet and adjusted the microphone.\n\nTakagi was never a man to shy away from a risky action, but to point the finger at Konoe so aggressively was most certainly a gamble. But his wasteful programs drove Japan into the series of disasters it now faced, all so he could curry favor with those who would line his pockets. It was a silent truth that Konoe had engaged in shifty activity as Prime Minister, but Takagi's allies did not have to look too hard to see how deep the prince's rot had affected the Japanese system.\n\nAs he delivered his speech to the hundreds of representatives, Takagi gauged that the mood of the room was shifting in his favor. Quick glances saw the party hardliners dart their eyes about or glare at opponents across the hall, while the men in the more liberal cliques gave their silent approval. He paused for a second - the climax of his speech, the true figure of Konoe's recklessness. Not just in the yen squirreled away in the pockets of generals and industrial magnates, but the message it would send to any aspiring Japanese citizen. What sense of honor is there in the footsteps of such a corrupt man?\n\nThe true answer is none at all."

They detailed the forced labor system and its recent performance across the Co-Prosperity Sphere. He tapped his pen on the desk a few times, and then reached over to the folders titled 'HEALTH AND LIFE EXPECTANCY SHOWA 36-37,' flicking through the relevant numbers. His face remained stiff and unbothered, and he scribbled down copied information, glancing back at the folder a few times.\n\nInstrumental for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure during the Great East Asian War, the Romusha penal servants now assembled goods and erected buildings for the corporations, with the Zaibatsus hiring hundreds, or even thousands, at a time. They worked mindlessly as slaves to their own crimes, and their labour was a redemption in the service of the Empire.\n\nTakagi grouped the folders to one corner of his desk, and reached for another sheet of paper to begin writing to his cabinet. He debated the benefits of regulation; with adequate protections, the labourers could work harder, for longer, and see real value in their service. However, he did acknowledge the contrary - leaving the laborers to the hungry Zaibatsus, and letting the market decide who was fittest in the servitude of their country, and who would perish seeking such forgiveness."

The populace has been terrorized into obedience and dread; inquiries were no longer necessary when the public had fostered a culture of awe and confession.\n\nEveryone knew someone who had seen a raid. They may have seen officers crash through the wooden doors of neighbours on their commute, or gazed with shock through the kitchen window at the beaten and bloodied bodies of nearby residents as they were dragged from their homes. As ghastly as these were, every raid began with a phone call or a tip from an informant - the responsible voice of the public, as propaganda demanded. Not to tell would be treason against the Emperor, a crime warranting unending agony, rotting in a sunlight-starved concrete cell.\n\nThe raw fear of the Kempeitai was an ordered chaos, and the oppressive air had morphed itself into a unique hostility in Japan. Neighbor told on neighbor. Brother told on brother. Familial squabbles could be solved with one call, and that single tip could grant the unsuspecting target a doom that death would be preferable to."

By no means a perfect time, he smiled fondly at the memories of adventure and challenge the daily marches brought.\n\nAnd when the war was done, he found himself back in Mutsu again, the cold winds from the sea a godsend. But his mind strayed back to the tropics again, though not because he was returning to the battlefield. Rather the younger Amari was to be sent there, mere weeks after he finished university. He went back indoors and turned on the radio, hoping to hear something good from Tokyo about the system that had unwillingly dragged his son into the same pit he chose to enter.\n\n"And today, Prime Minister Takagi has suggested a repeal to the long-held Mobilization Law to usher in an end to what he calls a 'war long ended, yet still long-fought for'...""

 jappmtakagi.5.t:0 "The Poison of Corruption"
 jappmtakagi.5.d:0 "Corruption. It is a thing that permeates the fabric and functions of the Japanese nation. As the corruption that Hiroya Ino so foolishly allowed to grow took root in the apparatus of state, it slowly made its way into every other level of society. Not everyone is corrupt, of course, but only the truly ignorant can claim not to know of someone who is. It could be a corporate executive, a general in the army, or a member of the house of representatives. Yet these days, it seems increasingly common that the corrupt one is someone as mundane as a minor bureaucrat or even a salaryman. Even if the problem exists among leaders and the general populace alike, the matter is handled differently among each group.\n\nFor many a general or politician, bribery has become a normal part of any deal they make, having long since thrown away their transparency and commitments. For the average citizen, corruption is something they must contend with at all times. A donation to the right person might allow them to receive a sudden promotion or send their children to a better school. Not all are lucky enough to have the money for such privileges, however.\n\nIn order to end this state of affairs, the Prime Minister has ordered that the corruption be removed from the apparatus of state so that it will no longer seep down through the rest of the nation. In response to this, two plans have been put forward. The first is to embark upon a full scale investigation that will leave no stone unturned and no suspect unquestioned. The other plan is to focus our resources on either a legislative or army investigation, as a more thorough search may provide better results."

 jappmtakagi.6.t:0 "Looking Upwards"
 jappmtakagi.6.d:0 "It had taken long enough, but Prime Minister Takagi had just about gotten comfortable in his new place of work. Indeed, the change from a small and spartan work station near the IJN anchorage to a large and grandiose office had been dramatic for him. It was most likely simply the passage of time, but the admiral felt that it had more to do with the news he was about to hear. Having finally been given a chance to take on the three-headed monster that was the three great issues that dominated the country, Takagi had found the process to be something of a slog. He could not leave one issue alone for too long, lest it reemerge and undo his progress. Yet it seemed now that his efforts were finally paying off.\n\nSitting at the center of a large table and surrounded by his cabinet, the Prime Minister awaited their usual reports. For once, it seemed as if his ministers were bringing him genuine, untwisted good news. Corruption was beginning to shrink away, the YSK was entering into a seemingly peaceful state, and much of the army's excessive militarization was being successfully curtailed. It was certainly not a tidal wave of upheaval and change, but it was enough to satisfy both Takagi and hopefully his supporters.\n\nAs the meeting came to a close and the ministers began to file out of the room, the Prime Minister requested that Koichi Kido stay behind. As the former first minister stood at one end of the table, he was still dwarfed by the seated Takagi. "Kido, you must have been here before. You must have sat in this very room and listened to your ministers tell you of success. But answer this. When was the moment when your efforts to reform caved in around you?" Kido considered the question before him, not moving for a good while. "It was sometime after the initial successes. I suppose I found myself feeling more confident than before. Yet I think ultimately that confidence was unfounded. I must admit... the reforms were made too quickly. There was simply no time to consider what my enemies were planning or who was joining their side."\n\nTakagi considered what Kido said. "And what can I hope to learn from this?"\n\n"Hiding beneath your banners of victory..."

 jappmtakagi.7.t:0 "Our Mandate Advances"
 jappmtakagi.7.d:0 "Prime Minister Takagi had taken the advice given to him by his deputy quite seriously. In the months following their conversation, he had taken great care to keep a close watch on both his allies and enemies. Much work had been done, and Takagi suspected that his vigilance had played a significant part in achieving that. There had indeed been much resistance to his reforms, a great deal of which had been made clear to him in the Imperial Diet and by a variety of figures within the IJA. There had been a number of attempts to lure the Prime Minister's allies away with bribes and threats, some of which had succeeded. Yet in the end, it had not been enough to topple the Prime Minister. For every ally lost, there were plenty more willing to take their place among the growing ranks of the Liberals.\n\nThe growth of Takagi's movement had certainly helped to reinforce the successes of his reforms. The dwindling cases of high-level corruption had not only eliminated a number of Takagi's rivals but also helped to effectivize the services they once abused. Militarization, an issue that once toppled Koichi Kido's government, was also in decline. It was beginning to become clear that the government, not the army, would oversee colonial matters from now on. Even the economy, once in shambles, was starting to recover. Takagi's corporate negotiations and government investment in new technology and industry had wrangled the flailing private sector into the beginnings of working order.\n\nBy this point, the Prime Minister's mandate had been established and was tolerated by the Imperial Diet. Takagi's attention now turned towards refining and harnessing his political base as well as the possibility of securing further alliances within the YSK. Finance Minister Nakasone was now also ready to put his proposal for a liberalized economy into action. Then, the colonies would also need to be thoroughly re-examined, in the hopes of truly extracting the very best out of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Takagi's mandate was in truth only starting to take effect."

 jappmtakagi.8.t:0 "Toshiba and Machine Learning"
 jappmtakagi.8.d:0 "Nestled at the back of the Toshiba building in Kanagawa was a large set of rooms. For the past few years, they had been occupied by a set of computers. Their loud humming and whirring had relegated them to the building's corner as to not disturb the rest of the floor, whose own work required more quiet conditions. Officially, the computers were there to solve mathematical equations and to complete simple organizational tasks. However, Nishioka Tetsuya, a computing researcher, had for a long while been pushing the boundaries of what the computers were truly capable of.\n\n"Mister Nishioka, I believe you wished to show me something. You mentioned a potential computing innovation?" The head of Toshiba's research department seemed like an intimidating man to Nishioka, who feared he had heard the promise of miraculous innovation followed by little more than poor excuses for failure. Nor did it help that his superior stood a good foot taller than him, which blotted out the light from the lamp behind him. "Yes, well I have been conducting some independent research into what our computers could theoretically be used for. You see sir, I was able to create a sort of virtual filing cabinet. It's little more than a set of names and occupations right now, but it seems promising. One of my colleagues thinks he can make one of our devices simulate a stock exchange and I've heard plenty of other promising ideas around the lab too!" A brief silence ensued, as Nishoka's superior seemed to not only analyse the information he had been given, but the purpose of his employee's occupation. "Very well Nishioka, I expect to see the computers operating your new systems by the end of the week."\n\nWithin a day, most every available researcher was assisting in the computing department. Trails of wires now spewed from the computer room's double doors, keeping them firmly open. A system of monitors had been set up, allowing for numerous personnel to observe the creation of a computerized archive of staff records as well as a simulated stock exchange. The latter innovation had created something of a joke around the lab: "Whatever you do, buy more Toshiba stock now!". Indeed, once the company higher ups unveiled their latest products to the market, said joke became something more of a cry on the Tokyo exchange floor."

 jappmtakagi.9.t:0 "The Tokyo of Old"
 jappmtakagi.9.d:0 "One hundred years ago, the city of Tokyo became the capital of our great nation. Since then, the "eastern capital" has grown exponentially, especially during the past few years. Tokyo is the heart of not just Japan, but of the Co-Prosperity Sphere too. Naturally, the city attracts people of all kinds, from businessmen and bureaucrats, to labourers and office workers. Although the city continues to grow, most of Tokyo's ward's remain unmodernised. While many cities across Japan have become places made up of concrete and steel, our capital seems to have become almost stuck in the past. Indeed, the core of Tokyo still consists of the buildings, plumbing and crude electrical wiring from a good few decades past. Nostalgia for our humbler past aside, the question of what to do about this dilemma is becoming increasingly pressing.\n\nTo the relief of Tokyo's city planning board, Prime Minister Takagi has embraced the chance to utilize the difficulty. Beyond merely modernizing the city, the Prime Minister believes that this may be a fine opportunity to create a clear symbol of his reforms. Indeed, what could be a finer symbol of the changing times? That the very capital of our nation, is to be rebuilt and massively improved after years of neglect. As Japan moves into the future, Tokyo will be lifted out of the past with it. It will receive all the infrastructure, utilities and grandeur of a modern capital.\n\nPerhaps most significant among these changes, is to be the creation of a new underground train network. The Prime Minister already has several companies interested in operating their own private train lines. This should also help to attract speculators to modernized wards across Tokyo. Within a few years, the city will become a metropolis worthy of the Japanese Empire."

 jappmtakagi.11.d:0 "The back of his chair was hot and sweaty; Takagi had been sitting in his office for hours now, flicking his fingers through the dossier that rested on his desk. The buzzing of his table lamp cut through the rustle of wind and roar of engines originating from the distant city center. For the first time in a while, and despite all the procrastination, the Prime Minister had finished early for the day.\n\nThe dossier laid flat on his wooden desk, fat with sheets and plans, all with the aim of restricting the top zaibatsus from growing beyond what was sustainable. From what he glanced over in his blurring memory of assorted pages, and what he picked up from the ramblings of Nakasone, there were various strategies to "leak" information about questionable zaibatsus and subsidiary companies to keiretsu insiders, ultimately attacking investor confidence and the value of shares, and thus beginning to chip away at zaibatsu power. Stirring scandals and whipping up rumors were something Takagi always wanted to stay far away from; he couldn't bear the sniffling press secretaries nibbling at his feet for more information. It was covert, unfair, and even illegal - but Takagi couldn't risk the failure of another conglomerate choking the nation into submission.\n\nAfter clearing his throat, and dancing his glares between the dossier and his coat perched still on the hanger, Takagi leapt from his seat and shuffled across his office. The plans were already in motion; Nakasone was given approval a short while ago. Burden wrested with necessity in his heart, though his steel gaze appeared as if he was unbothered and stoic as ever.\n\n"Leave it until tomorrow morning, when zeal will sober my conscience," he said to himself, exhaling out his tired words, as he prepared his items to leave the office."

He was certainly surprised that his employer made it to this position, since the admiral was largely disregarded in the Imperial Diet as the ringleader of a fringe group; relevant e`nough to ask to join a coalition in, but not enough to be considered a contender for the position of Prime Minister. Perhaps because of his success, Takagi decided to let his long-standing advisor in on the discussion at hand.\n\nIn a stately room around a platter of appetizers, Takagi Soukichi had gathered his attendants and a few representatives from the diet. In a curt speech, he outlined the main issue his government would face- their liberation of the Japanese economic market riled up many representatives who got their seats with hefty donations from the industrialists and military. While some, such as the sanctum of prince Konoe's conservatives would be hard to appeal to, other cliques in the party responded well to the feelers the Prime Minister sent out.\n\n"And above all else, we have to emphasize that unlike Kido, we are willing to strike a fair deal with potential backers in the Diet.

 jappmtakagi.19.d:0 "The warm day made it an excellent time for Prime Minister Takagi to speak with his esteemed guests in a small cottage outside of Tokyo. His days away from the endless tumult the government gave in Tokyo were rare, and even rarer did work follow him outside the city. But with men like Nakasone and Kido, a few hours would not hurt.\n\nBoth men had been audacious in their insistence to see him, after Takagi had sent his feelers out for new allies in the Lower House. While the former was certainly well-liked, his proposals for merging Kido's reformists to the Reform Bureaucrats had irritated the admiral, who curtly dismissed his appeals before another call from Koichi Kido, a man whose political maneuvering could never be kept in check.\n\nWith a number of short talks outside the government complexes of Tokyo, Kido had made an excellent case for unifying the more liberal factions in the Yokusankai. It was a great gamble to take a man as volatile to the conservative groups as Kido into his coalition, but such men would settle for a return to the Shogunate before they acquiesced to moving Japan forward. Takagi swirled the crystal glass of champagne around before giving into the sly man's offer."

He served on a cruiser under his command in the Great East Asian War, he worked as a middleman to get Imperial Navy officers to support his rise to politics, and now he struggled even harder in Takagi's grab for the seat of Prime Minister. Now he stood on an unstable mountain, where the wrong steps would see an avalanche suffocate not only the greying admiral, but Osahito and every other ally and cabinet member the Prime Minister used to reach the summit.\n\nTakagi's plan was desperate, almost the opposite of what one would expect from the fast-thinking admiral he was twenty years prior. He would settle for nothing less than to force his plans through the webs of Japanese administration, no matter the cost. Even his closest ministers felt the plan was too reckless. Both Saato and Yasushiro threatened to leave, but the charismatic Takagi sat them back down.\n\n"The path we are facing will not be made easier by conceding any more than we have and allying with those who but weeks ago wished for our downfall. Japan needs to be restructured, and I promise all of you that it will be. To leave now is not just cowardice or treachery, but to consign yourself to the continued decline of Japan and the ascendance of our national enemies." As he spoke, his eyes stabbed into everyone present with him, furious yet collected, orderly yet authoritative. He continued onwards, and by the end of his short speech, the power of the room had shifted entirely to him.\n\nHe dismissed everyone, including the young Saato. Never before had he felt so threatened and inspired. As he took the train back to his apartment, his thoughts no longer went to disbelief at Takagi's stalwartness, but plots to ensure his vision stayed true."

The Prime Minister's rooms included a single room customized for his own needs. Prime Minister Takagi found the room distractingly ornate, but it provided a place to invite Representative Kido for a number of private discussions.\n\nThe two men led some of the most liberal cliques in the party, but even then their allies would spar with each other. The old admiral had his own scores to settle with Kido's wildly unpopular plans, and Koichi found Sokichi's policies to cater too much to his pals in the Navy and the keiretsu. Yet the two would need to work together and get still another faction into their growing coalition to secure a majority in the Lower House. The unlikely target was Ikeda's Conservatives, who were not so reactionary that they were all guaranteed to dig themselves into the opposition, but compromises would have to be made.\n\nWhile the two spent the evening figuring out their approaches, the great question remained of Kido's most radical reformists; could Ikeda be brought into the coalition without destroying their own faction and forcing Takagi to search for another ally? It would only work, it seemed, if all three ringleaders were treated as equals, even if one was the Prime Minister."

But the uptight nobility of the Meiji era were not the audience he expected to meet with. Most of the fading aristocrats sent their estate managers to deliver their records, though a few showed up to personally meet with the lower-level auditors, often with complaints of how Takagi showed no respect for the greatest families of Japan. Even some of the commissioner's own subordinates were buying into their claims of unjust inspection.\n\nThe one who first began to question the legality was a rather plain auditor from Sapporo; his records showed no mention of affiliation with radicals or the Kazoku. He had even threatened to speak with a number of Japanese news agencies about the supposed 'purging' of Japan's old families to provide the Prime Minister with a slush fund. From the perspective of the average citizen, the agitator's case seemed sound. But the commissioner had not spent decades of work just to let public opinion interfere now; the Board of Audits was already a name reviled as much as any criminal gang to many.\n\nDespite all this, nobody, not even the descendants of the legendary heroes of Japan, would be above a financial review.

Alongside the normal complaints of drug smugglers, bandits, and so-called 'exploration parties' from Russia, the valuable riches of Manchuria and its strategic position to the rest of Northern China guaranteed that whoever ran Manchukuo could turn his head and receive some very handsome sums from military leaders, local administrators, and mining executives.\n\nTakagi had spent much of his years aware of the troubles that the vast and profitable region dealt with, ever since the Mukden Incident. If he was to clean the whole Co-Prosperity Sphere from the corruption it had bathed in since the East Asian War, Manchukuo would be the ideal starting ground. While government agents had arrested some collaborators in the machinations of Manchuria's rotten workings, he wondered if he should tempt any more rats to catch before sweeping the protectorate of all those who used it to benefit themselves, or kick down the door.\n\nAs a new report of an IJA-run iron mine was delivered to his desk, his thoughts drifted to the drain, both morally and financially, these institutions had wrought upon Japan."

Over the span of two days, reports from government agents and federal police in Mukden, Dalian, and Shenyang confirmed almost all of the underhanded bureaucrats and greedy officers had been taken in for questioning, along with a slew of native Manchurians working alongside their masters in a long list of stealing funds, false reports, secret concessions to the Army and Navy, and supplying material to potential rebel groups.\n\nTakagi enjoyed the good news; even the most conservative representatives and councilors in the Imperial Diet applauded, at least publicly, the Prime Minister's most recent efforts to protect both Japanese and Manchurian from dishonorable and thuggish enemies.\n\nAnd as the televisions and radios sung their praises, the Prime Minister turned his eyes to other members of the Sphere whose administrations had been long left unchecked."

It was more than anything the companies that annoyed the commander. Space alongside one of the largest port cities in Asia was tough to find, and the transportation arms of the zaibatsu had no problem bullying the local leaders into displacing whole neighborhoods to expand their holdings. Worst of all were the other base commanders in Guangdong, who would take lifetime's worth of bribes to let these freighters dock at Imperial Navy stations.\n\nLooking out as another freighter belched smoke on its course through the ruddy water, he went to deliver a phone call to a good friend in Tokyo, urging him to put an immediate end to the blatant corruption that ran through Guangdong."

Frantic phone calls across the bay in the night had not given an answer, but for Rear-Admiral Kudo, he had been able to slip away from any accusations. As the prisoners were marched into the detention rooms on base, Hayao looked up from his office and smiled."

 jappmtakagi.27.t:0 "A Hand Against The Conservatives"
 jappmtakagi.27.d:0 "Takagi flicked through the dossier that had sat on his table for hours now. He didn't want to open it and read its contents, as he already knew what was inside. After a deep breath, he dashed for the files. Flicking through the papers, he read through the names of members of the National Diet that were of interest to his government. All conservatives, his eyes wafted through the list of titles, ages, names, families - everything the state could scrounge up about them, from commendments to potential scandals. There was something that tied many of these conservative politicians together: they were all still loyal to Ino.\n\nMinamoto - A childhood friend of Ino\nSugawara - A old colleague of Ino from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce\nWatanabe - A politician from Hiroshima on good terms with Ino\nTanomogi - A close financier of Ino's past campaigns\n\nThe Prime minister reclined momentarily in his seat, before lunging forwards towards his desk and grabbing a pen. Bribes, he thought to himself; the only thing that could pry these men from their loyalties to one another was significant financial gain over each other. It was ghastly disappointment to see the inner-workings of the Diet be so corrupted by money, but with his stone-cold determination to reform this system, Takagi knew he had to play this sick and kleptocratic game to win."

 jappmtakagi.28.t:0 "The Moderates Among Us"
 jappmtakagi.28.d:0 "By the end of the session in the National Diet, Takagi noticed he had quite a lot more on his agenda completed than usual. Although he was far from completing his 'to-do list' of economic, military, and political reform, there were certainly more successes in his lineup of propositions to the Diet. Even in votes he had lost, the Prime Minister commanded the confidence of far more conservatives in each motion.\n\nClinks of fine beverages at fancy dinners and flashy new cars at motor races; all of these lavish and luxurious lifestyle choices Takagi occasionally wedged himself in on to get on amicable terms with the conservatives in the Diet. Whilst some grew to hate him even more, a significant portion looked to him and smiled, either for his suddenly ornate appreciation of Japanese upper-class pleasures or simply for the money he slipped them. Regardless, Takagi used these tools occasionally to swing enough members under his influence, and it was working quite well.\n\nTakagi scratched the fat cat's belly, and in doing so, he had won the loyalty of a large conservative camp in the National Diet. It was a dirty move, but if it meant they would stop blocking his reforms, it was worth it. No longer having to copy the failed initiatives of the past onto tomorrow's agenda, the efforts to bribe opposition in the Diet had certainly impacted the successes of Takagi's call for reform. He had fattened their wallets with cash prizes to win their vote, and possibly a chance at changing Japan altogether."

 jappmtakagi.29.t:0 "The Enemy Within"
 jappmtakagi.29.d:0 "It was late at night, and the stormy rains outside the Prime Minister's office had been hammering against the glass windows for hours. The room was dark, lit only by the small jade lamps dotted across the room. The crack of the small burning fire was peace amongst the deluge from the night sky; its embers were calming as they roasted in the great fireplace. Takagi sat in a leather chair in the corner of his office, away from his desk, and scribbled names of politicians identified to be of use in the National Diet.\n\nThe Liberals had continually shown their affinity for reform, supporting measures and initiatives to re-invent and reorganise the ways in which we conduct domestic and foreign policy. Whilst many have been known to back his motions in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister made note of their reluctance to follow through on key policy change. Omoto, Amago, Oda - all names infamous in the Diet for rallying opposition to the Prime Minister's legislative efforts in aligning his vision for a new Japan. Takagi remembered their sneering grins. He could feel the same bubbling and seething anger he had to bury under parliamentary procedure in that moment as if they were mocking him from across the room he was currently in.\n\nAfter moments of rage, Takagi exhaled a deep breath. The rain still pummelled against the windows of his office, and his attention turned to the crackling fire. The Prime Minister knew their lack of compromise would be eased by slipping money through the cracks of their political discipline. It was a dirty move; one full of corruption, duplicity, and fraud. Even so, this was a dirty game, and if the Prime Minister could not convince the Liberals with words, he would use wealth to sway their votes in his favor. Takagi tapped the end of his pen on his lips, thinking of whose names to scribble down first."

 jappmtakagi.30.t:0 "Our Faction Cleaned"
 jappmtakagi.30.d:0 "With the bribes sent and received, the session in the National Diet was not typical of Takagi's usually frustrating endeavors. Rather than being met with rolling eyes, smirking politicians, and mocking grins from many of the Liberal camp in the Diet, his legislative proposals were listened to and voted on. In fact, Takagi commanded significant confidence from many in the Liberal camp, with the exception of the occasional die-hard oppositional politician who snared under his breath from the corner of his seat.\n\nThe bribes worked, and an unusual ease came over the Prime Minister. No longer fighting an uphill battle with the Liberals in the National Diet, some time and mental space was freed from these vices. "What to do now?" he thought, reclining behind his desk and thinking about his new political agenda in the Diet. A silence submerged his thoughts in a mist of confusion. How was it so easy? They had abandoned their high and mighty standards for a pretty price, and now they followed the same line of the Prime Minister they used to heckle from the stands as he read it to the crowds.\n\nWith these blocks to Takagi's aims lifted, the Liberals would seemingly roll over to his demands. Their loyalty had been bought, and they were now on-board with the Prime Minister as long as the money was slid right under the table. Time would test this mutual understanding, but for now it seemed that the Prime Minister had struck a perfect deal."

 jappmtakagi.31.t:0 "Lunch with the Diet"
 jappmtakagi.31.d:0 "[GetDateText]\n\nThe Imperial Diet continues to baffle me. Ever since I was chosen as Prime Minister, the issue has only grown more apparent. I seemingly cannot escape the corruption in the Diet, even when attempting to introduce minor legislation. It appears that I have more work to do than I had previously thought.\n\nEarlier today, I had called the diet together to discuss the matter of introducing standardized quality checks at farms across Japan. I thought it to be a trifling matter that would not take more than a few minutes to debate and vote upon. Yet before I could even finish reading my own proposal, a series of loud objections were made quite clear to me by a cluster of liberals. I therefore believed that my proposal was now doomed, due to the nagging and minute complaints of members of my own clique. Even so, the vote on the subject was to be held after lunch. There was perhaps still some hope that I could reassure the disgruntled representatives.\n\nI had taken to eating in the Lunchroom as most other members of the Diet did, mostly for the purpose of keeping an eye on my opponents but also for the quality of the food. I was pleased to see the offending liberals there, as I had hoped to sit with them to resolve the matter before the vote. Yet as I was about to approach their table, I noticed that two others had joined them. These were men that I was familiar with, reliable politicians who believed firmly in my cause. Observing from afar, I noted the jovial nature of the conversation. It appeared that they had beaten me to implementing my own plan. However, just as the conversation broke off, I witnessed the quick transfer of paper money to the objecting liberals. I focused entirely on eating my food for the rest of lunch.\n\nWhen the votes were tallied, it did not surprise me when my proposal was approved by the Diet. While it was a victory, I could not help but feel disgust at its price."

 jappmtakagi.32.t:0 "The Finances of the Think Tanks"
 jappmtakagi.32.d:0 ""Prime Minister, the accountants have arrived with the documents from the think tanks you wanted them to examine." Prime Minister Takagi gestured for the aforementioned accountants to be let in. He had expected perhaps two or three, but as six men entered his office, Takagi was admittedly somewhat confused. Yet as he gazed out of his office window, it became apparent that six accountants would indeed be needed. A second car pulled up at the steps and the driver began to onload a number of large boxes, each one containing documents. "I suppose those are the financial files we will be looking over," inquired the Prime Minister. The accountants replied with a respectful nod.\n\nEventually, the seven or so boxes were delivered to the Prime Minister's office. Their work could begin. Immediately, it became apparent that little effort had been put in properly organizing the documents. Although not directly involved in the process of organizing, Takagi would occasionally request an update on their progress. "It would appear that the think tanks are trying to make this a challenge for us. We've had to re-organize everything in these boxes."\n\n"Prime Minister, I believe it pertinent that you see this. Once you begin looking at the whole picture, you realise that money simply pours in and out of these think tanks. They've separated their budgets from the sections detailing their funding. Here, you'll see they've accepted money from-"\n\n"The military, Diet representatives, and a number of corporations, sir," chimed in another accountant. "They've carefully hidden their real records within these ones. If you give us more time, we should be able to decipher more." Not wanting to let the think tanks go unpunished, Takagi agreed to let them take as much time as they needed. "No wonder they were always trying to contradict me," muttered the Prime Minister to himself."
 jappmtakagi.32.a:0 "Clearly they didn't think enough about secrecy."

 jappmtakagi.33.t:0 "Unauthorized Cabinet Members"
 jappmtakagi.33.d:0 "Prime Minister Takagi had grown accustomed to eating in the Lunchroom of the Imperial Diet building. While the food was much richer than that which he had been served during his time in the navy, Takagi could not say that he found it unpleasant. He had similar feelings about the decor, but unlike the food, the design was not to his taste. Regardless, he ate his meals without complaint and focused mostly on casually observing other members of the diet from the strategic placement of his cabinet minister table. He could now recognise virtually anyone who regularly ate in the lunchroom, whether they were a Representative or a Peer.\n\nIt therefore came as a surprise to him when two men that he had never seen before sat down at the table for cabinet members as if that had been their dining table since birth. They clearly knew each other, as Takagi observed their relaxed and cheery conservation from a few feet away. His gaze did not break from the pair, even as their conversation turned to idle chatter upon starting their meal. Eventually, they noticed the Prime Minister staring at them. Clearly put off by the look they were getting from Takagi, they silently greeted him with a respectful nod and then hastily finished their meal in silence.\n\nThe Prime Minister returned to his office, considering the offensive sight he had witnessed. There was no doubt that they were new members of his cabinet, or they would not have dared to breach decorum by occupying the cabinet table. Yet Takagi had not appointed them to his cabinet. He certainly never would, based on their behaviour in the lunchroom. No, someone else had selected these two for cabinet positions without informing him. While he intended to eventually discover the perpetrator, the Prime Minister was in truth more concerned with finding an excuse to get rid of his unwanted subordinates. Once he had replaced them with suitable choices, the message would be quite clear enough."

 jappmtakagi.34.d:0 ""Brother, would take a look at this?" Teruya Teruo had hoped to get his brother's attention with the article he was reading in the newspaper. Teruya Kenichi was unfortunately engrossed in a thrilling documentary about Japanese wildlife, and ignored Teruo. "Kenichi, this is genuinely important. The Prime Minister has just announced that several think tanks have been taking money from generals and corporations!" Kenichi dismissed his older brother's concern as another overreaction to what had probably been an open secret for ages. Taken slightly aback that his younger brother had once again dismissed the news, Teruo restated that it only once again proved that the Prime Minister was truly committed to reform. This had not been the first time he had exposed high-level corruption, after all. "Why else would he so publically share something that affects even the most secretive parts of our society?" Clearly annoyed by his brother's insistence, Kenichi finally turned to look at Teruo. "All you've done since graduating from university is sit at home and read the papers. There's a whole world out there! Go out and find a job!"\n\nSensing his cause was quite lost, Teruo returned to his newspaper. He probably did need a job. It would certainly take his mind off things. The job listings proved quite boring and disheartening until he came upon the last thing he could have possibly expected. One of the think tanks was searching for a junior economist. "It looks like that degree might finally pay off, huh?" The older brother tossed the paper towards his sibling, who proceeded to pick it up after it narrowly missed the TV. "Well Teruo, if you want to find out if those think tanks are bad as the Prime Minister says they are, now's your chance.""

 jappmtakagi.35.t:0 "A Shift Within Japanese Democracy"
 jappmtakagi.35.d:0 "Elections were an inconsistent matter in the Empire of Japan. Up until recently, they had not been held at regular intervals, instead occurring entirely upon the whims of the government. The results of the vote were often dubious too, although the level of interference was ultimately decided by the Prime Minister and the wider Taisei Yokusankai. Usually this took the form of intimidating independent candidates or making last minute changes to polling stations and minor electoral regulations. Prime Minister Takagi had, until recently, largely focused his attention on other matters, but now a report had arrived on his desk. It seemed he would have to consider the future of the Japanese electoral process.\n\nThe report outlined possible ways that a potential future election could be rigged in favour of the government. It would work, there was no question about that in Takagi's mind. However, as the public was more than aware of previous electoral fraud, Takagi would certainly suffer a blow to his standing with the populace. Realising that he could not possibly make a decision on whether to commit to the plan now, the Prime Minister dismissed the advisors in his office and bade them return in the afternoon.\n\nIn truth, losing face with the public was not something Takagi wished to deal with. He had worked hard to earn the trust of a population that had grown tired by years of negligent governments and army obstruction. Yet this downside was in many ways a tactical loss, rather than a strategic one. If Takagi increased his strength in the Imperial Diet, then he would be far more capable of implementing his own reforms. Many of said reforms would go a long way in improving the lives of Japanese people. Prime Minister Takagi was now sure of his choice. He would guarantee that the election produced a grand victory, and then do all that was in his power to make sure he did not waste such a golden opportunity."

 jappmtakagi.36.d:0 "The school trip into central Tokyo had been amazing so far. Kawane Ryo had visited the capital once before. This time, he was old enough to truly appreciate the sights around him. It certainly beat his quiet village by a wide margin, he thought. During the hour-long bus ride, the classes' teacher Kagawa-san had taken the opportunity to go into greater detail about what their trip was about. The government had begun a new initiative to promote an interest in politics in the younger generations. Part of this involved taking a few classes to visit the Imperial Diet Building, where they would get to witness politics in action. Kagawa-san was careful to remind her students they were to be exceptionally well-behaved in the Diet Building, as it was in that place that their future was being decided. Ryo vowed to remember that.\n\nTo the disappointment of the class, they were not let in through the grand front entrance of the National Diet building. Instead, they entered through a side door and had their bags searched. With that done, the children were finally allowed into the building proper, where they were greeted by a Mihara-San, who was to be their guide. Ryo listened diligently to Mihara-San's descriptions of the Diet's many rooms and their functions, but it was the stunning architecture that truly captured his attention. The central hall, with its ornately carved walls and arches, landscape paintings and shining glasswork stuck with Ryo the most. Mihara-San did a good job of capturing the class's attention, so when he announced that they would now be attending a session of the Diet, many of them were quite excited. The House of Representatives' chamber was equally as impressive as the entrance hall, with the added benefit of comfortable seating. As the grand chamber filled with the representatives of the Diet, Ryo was eager to hear what they would be discussing. As it turned out, the meeting of the Diet was in fact rather dull. For an entire half hour, they discussed little more than budget deficits.\n\nWhen Kawane Ryo returned home, his parents were eager to hear about his school visit to the Imperial Diet. "I had fun," was his simple but truthful response."

 jappmtakagi.37.t:0 "Auditing the Independents"
 jappmtakagi.37.d:0 ""Shall we proceed with the list, sir?" Takagi's assistant offered the Prime Minister the first of many files that had been stacked high on his desk. These were audits that had been conducted on each and every independent in the House of Representatives. The audits had yielded plenty of evidence against certain independents, but it was ultimately up to Takagi to decide what would become of them. The first file pertained to a man he recognised. He had been a promising naval officer, whose career had been cut short by a sudden desire to play politics. Takagi considered him a good friend, even if they did have their disagreements on policy. "I needn't say that it would be stupid to exectute and imprison every independent. I think I'll select a few of them at random. That should produce the desired effect."\n\nTakagi continued his examination of the audits. He came across a few more friends, some of whom had crossed the line on a few occasions. Regardless, The Prime Minister quickly placed them into the pile of those that would be spared. Most of the other Independents were not men he knew especially well, little more than nuisances in his mind. Sending a few of them to prison would lose the Prime Minister no sleep. Some of the audits had produced little in the way of evidence, while others contained solid proof of treason. Either way, Takagi selected them at random with an efficient pace.\n\nIt was only when he read the file of another one of his friends that he paused. He was another naval officer, although his career had been much longer. He turned to politics after retiring from the Navy. As an independent his focus has been on local politics for his small rural community in Yamagata. Yet it appeared that he had made some deals with foreign companies, and used his connections in the navy to smuggle them Japanese goods. Takagi was deeply distrubed by the actions of his trusted friend. He all but dropped the file into the pile of the guilty, before reconsidering and placing it in the opposite stack. "He'll learn his lesson", the Prime Minister thought to himself."
 jappmtakagi.37.a:0 "A better friend than he'll ever know."

 jappmtakagi.38.t:0 "Protecting our Democracy"
 jappmtakagi.38.d:0 "Takagi sat alone in his office. All but the essential staff at the Imperial Diet had gone home for the day, which had turned the usually bustling and noisy halls rather more quiet. It was this time of day that the Prime Minister used to reflect upon current events, as well as his own recent actions and decisions. He could not deny that he had made good progress in terms of implementing democratic reforms.\n\nThe school tours of the Imperial Diet had proved successful; More young people than ever had expressed interest in joining the YSK, and many more were eager to vote in the next election. The best result had perhaps been the increased support for the government among the youth. There had been successes in other areas too. The independents had recently proven more agreeable in the Diet, ever since their numbers were slightly thinned through the auditing process. Even more corruption, Takagi's ever-present enemy, had been purged through a recent examination of the Think-Tanks. Not only had this yet again weakened bribery and subversion, but it had markedly improved the effectiveness of the Think-Tanks themselves. For the first time in a while, they were actually doing their jobs.\n\nProgress had been swift and certainly efficient. Still, this left the Prime Minister with a single linger question: "Has too much been done, in too little time?" This was not the first time Takagi had feared that his reforms had been rushed through without enough thought given to long term consequences. He reminded himself this was the inevitable effect of hindsight. The dice had been cast in his favour, now all Takagi could do was plan his next turns carefully. Precise and steady reform was necessary, but nothing would truly get his enemies off his back. The Ship had set sail long ago and the Captain was now bound to sail it safely into port."

They had leads on uncovering corruption and embezzlement in government pay and were gathering evidence on clear criminal activity so they could reach a just conclusion.\n\nNoticing great differences between individual civil servants and certain officers in the IJA, Nakasone glanced between two printed sheets spread out across the floor. He called to the rest of the cabinet to notice that even in senior positions, their pay was not even comparable to various colonial administrators throughout the empire. Moreover, and much to Takagi's displeasure, it seemed that different members of government were receiving varying levels of pay. Scandal, he called it, grabbing the papers from Nakasone's hands and gazing at the payrolls; the Prime Minister decided that it was up to him to reverse such excessive greed."

 jappmtakagi.40.d:0 "The foamy pacific waves crashed against the great harbors as Takagi had sent investigators across the empire in search of the nation's criminal fraudsters. Based on information gathered with his cabinet, the Prime Minister had requested a survey of all major Japanese ports in search of misappropriated funds, resources, and labor. The investigations went through mostly unchallenged in major dockyards but often faced the scowls and sneers of officers made uncomfortable with the poking and prodding of anti-corruption officials.\n\nSome cabinet members were quick to point out that the Prime Minister, himself of a naval background in the IJN, may impede the successes of the investigations by covering up details on account of his history as a naval officer. Outraged by the infidelity of his own ministers, Takagi lashed back in a tense dispute - eventually coming to an agreement that his domestic minister, Horikiri Zenjiro, should be delegated the authority to carry out the inquiry across the country."

They shook hands and sat opposite to each other whilst discussing Tadashi's findings; the Prime Minister was fascinated by the responsibilities of the military in defense and administration across Asia. Also being presented with Ino's 1962 report on the economic affairs of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Takagi drew his attention to the great costs of this military bureaucracy.\n\nIn truth, the Armed Forces' role across Asia was bloated and inefficiently organized. They racked up billions of Yen each year, and often found themselves inadequately trained or running particularly repressive administrations over civilian populations. The Prime Minister, now aware of the great burden to reform the colonial responsibilities of the empire, closed the report and leaned back in his chair and let out a deep breath - preparing himself for the great task at hand."

 jappmtakagi.42.d:0 "Takagi, alone in his office, flicked through the section of Tadashi's report that detailed the IJA presence in Choson and Taiwan. Overall, military involvement in the governance of Taiwan was the most tame; as the 'model colony' acquired in the Japan-Qing War, the people of Taiwan had grown accustomed to and comfortable with IJA presence across the island. The island was vastly underdeveloped, however, and was in desperate need of modernizing. However, cooperation between natives, Japanese settlers, and the IJA formed a uniquely constructive community in Taiwan - striking a pleasing balance for the Prime Minister.\n\nChoson was a different story, however. Repeated abuses of the native population by the IJA had been reported by civilian organizations as they used slave labor in military administration. Things were particularly brutal in the north of the peninsula, where local populations were regularly worked for the benefit and sometimes entertainment of corrupt and irresponsible military officials. The Prime Minister was aware of the particularly gluttonous governance of southern Choson, particularly in major cities, but news of the abuses in the north and rural regions revolted him."

 jappmtakagi.43.t:0 "The Colonial Situation - SEA"
 jappmtakagi.43.d:0 "Sifting further through Tadashi's dossier, Takagi read of the military presence in Southeast Asia. Garrisons were freckled throughout the region, undertaking patrols throughout the dense jungles and rambling cities of the region. Indeed, the nations of Southeast Asia had largely been deferential towards the Empire of Japan.\n\nWhat was to be noted was how unnecessary the presence of thousands of troops in single regions were to the integrity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Not only did this burden Tokyo with sky-high costs in growing military budgets, but the overbearing residence of our troops agitated the local populations and often proliferated anti-Japanese sentiment. Where the power really rested, however, was in the IJN that dominated the South China Sea and Indonesian Archipelago, influencing the affairs of collaborationist governments through corrupt dealings and threats of bombardment. Takagi rubbed his eyes and scribbled down the notes of his findings as he read on, hoping to come up with a conclusive argument for colonial reform in the region."

 jappmtakagi.44.d:0 "The Prime Minister had come to the section of the report he felt he knew, opening each page armed with a skepticism of legal IJA activities in China. He certainly approved of military administrations across the region, maintaining a firm paternalism over the affairs of the Chinese. However, reading reports detailing IJA abuses in rural regions, the Takagi was troubled more by the accounts of massacres, weapons tests, and other atrocities committed against the local populace.\n\nThis was too common among the undisciplined troops in China, Takagi thought, it was bad for the civilian interaction with their Japanese benefactors. He scoffed; what bastard thought that slave labor, random acts of killing, and the rapes of entire households of women would increase their opinion of us? So, after spending some time massaging his temples, Takagi took the time to begin piecing together notes and ideas on how to end the juvenile negligence of duty in the Chinese regions, and make the IJA a force worthy of fear and respect. After all, if the Japanese were to maintain their rule in China, they would have to do it well."

Skimming over the paragraphs explaining statistics and operations, it was clear to the Prime Minister that the IJA largely relied on the collaborator government in defending the region.\n\nThe military of the Azad Hind government was large enough to defend much of its territories, only requesting Japanese support in strategic and intelligence operations. Indeed, with IJA advisors as comfortable friends as well as allies with officials in Calcutta, the region was not nearly dominated by the military affairs of the empire. Takagi came to the conclusive paragraph, nodding and informed, noting the contingency of the numbers of Japanese forces within Indian territories in the withdrawals that he may request."

He held Tadashi's report in his hand, waving it as he discussed embezzlement in the military, administrative malfeasance, and the unnecessary presence of the IJA in regions unbecoming of garrison occupation. The Prime Minister and his cabinet had spent hours of their time sifting through statistics, reports, and graphs, and this was their moment to present a conclusive declaration of the government's actions towards corruption and misappropriation throughout the military.\n\nAfter finalizing his government's opinions on the report, Takagi announced that cuts to the IJA were going to be made across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, withdrawing military personnel and tightening the budget. Many advisors with ties to the armed forces gasped and grumbled, and Takagi raised his voice to quell the ambiguities and outrage among his small audience. Dealing with their reactions will be the hardest part of this process, he thought, before smiling at the advisors and taking questions."

Another young officer arrives at the table, carrying with him several alcoholic drinks, which are then distributed around the table.\n\n"What are you guys talking about?" he states as he takes his seat.\n\nOne of the less sociable officers, sitting in a corner seat and smoking, speaks up. "Our friend over here believes that the withdrawal of the garrisons is going to get Takagi in with the higher-ups, and it might do, for a while. But, ultimately, flooding the home islands with troops who have nothing to do is only going to go bad for him. What he doesn't know is that at any moment, all the praise is gonna disappear if he makes the wrong room, and then what."

 jappmtakagi.48.t:0 "The Old Man and the Letter"
 jappmtakagi.48.d:0 "It is the old men who drag down every one of our reforms, it is the old men who blindly cling to the ideals of the old Japan. It is the old men who act as dripping manifestations of social inertia across the political battlefields of the nation. It is only right that, with time, the political establishment must wipe away vestiges of bygone eras. Or, at least, that is what Takagi thought as he ordered his allies and followers to cut ties with, or even ostracize, the old men of the Tōseiha, an informal web of political alliances dating back to the 20s. And, after a few weeks of silence, Takagi sat back with relief at the success of the operation. There would be no battle, it would seem, over letting sick dogs loose.\n\nThat would be until, the next morning, a letter appeared on top of the stack of papers he was to read through and sign. Opening it with deliberation, Takagi read the words on top; "A warning, for the Prime Minister's eyes." Pulling out the letter from the envelope, Takagi anxiously glanced over the paragraphs contained within. The letter detailed a plan, abound with blackmail and scandal, which would bring about the downfall of the Takagi government if the old men were not welcomed, with open arms, back into both the Tōseiha and the administration. Apparently, from what the letter said, nearly the entire government bureaucracy was waiting for the right moment to overthrow Takagi, and his ever-despised reforms.\n\nThe day, then forward, moved at a distorted pace. At every mark of his pen, at every sentence read, Takagi could not help but survey his environment. A secretary pushing a cart down a hallway. The clock ticking, and ticking, and ticking again. Once his cabinet, at last, came to meet with him, he wrangled them into a spare closet. Each of them, after looking over the letter, laughed it off. After closer inspection, it was discovered that several titles and names were misspelled, the letter's plans didn't really make sense, and its claims were far too grandiose. At the behest of his advisers, Takagi threw the letter in the trash, and moved on with the day. It could only be a bluff... right?"

 jappmtakagi.49.t:0 "Letters can have Nothing Inside"
 jappmtakagi.49.d:0 "In the hush hours of midnight, a sweaty old man, half-dressed, rummages through the trash can of his office. After making a mess of his office, throwing old pens and discarded contracts all over the floor, the old man arrives at his goal. A torn-up letter sits in Takagi's hands, the one he discarded earlier that day. Reaching into a drawer in his desk, Takagi finds a small flask, the contents of which he shakily pours over the letter. Takagi takes the letter, soaking wet in alcohol, out into the parking lot of the National Diet Building. He pulls a lighter from his pocket, and flicks at it a few times before setting the letter alight. Takagi lets go of the letter as it burns, transforming it into mere ash in the wind.\n\nThe night is sleepless. Takagi arrives at the office with his eyes burning, stumbling around woozily. It continues like this for weeks on end, until Takagi is at last able to meet with his cabinet. The cabinet sets up in the boardroom in a sombre quiet, all while Takagi stares forward, unwavering in his sight. "So..." Takagi whispers forward. "There is no plot, no revolt, to depose us. The letter was lying."\n\nNakasone puts his hands forward, and gives a gentle chuckle. "Well... of course, I thought we already proved this? It was amateur work. I would be delighted to see anyone try to pull off the plan in that letter." Nakasone looks around with a bright smile, while the rest of the cabinet laugh. The thought that the entire bureaucracy would revolt because a few old men lost their place in society was, indeed, amusing.\n\nTakagi delivers a heavy heave, before joining his cabinet in laughter. It was, after all, just an empty threat. Takagi's laughter is, however, underlined by a lingering anxiety. If a few old men could have such an effect on him, what about the rest of the targets of his reforms? Would these threats remain empty? The path forward is dark, and our only light is our dwindling hopes."

Climb the governmental ladder, and lie every step of the way. What you say or think as a civilian or civil servant does not matter. Lies, blackmail, forgery, and above all, violence, will only be used against us if we do not fight back. We are not defenseless, this is reform with power, reform backed by the will of the righteous. We are a flicker burning amidst a storm, and do not be mistaken. We. Will. Burn.\n\nThe "reformist" bureaucrats, who have done nothing to earn their title, have not only held our society back from true reform, but are actively regressing it. Well, justice has arrived.

 jappmtakagi.51.d:0 "Takagi took a seat. This chair, however, was not behind a desk, nor a lunch table or a counter. This chair presided over the rows upon rows of Japan's noblemen, each staring at Takagi. The chair was a massive piece of decor, made of ornately carved and polished Sugi. Takagi settled his arms uncomfortably within its bounds, the hard back of the chair already taking its toll on his spine. The throne of the Emperor, colorful in its design and of a heavenly, regal craft, sat empty a few feet behind the seat of the Prime Minister. The last time he had been in the House of Peers, years and years ago, he had only sat in the observer's balcony. He couldn't remember much, only that he held a distaste for these men of privilege who took it upon themselves to abuse the positions and promises of their forefathers.\n\nOnce the crowd settled down, and the aides began motioning him to begin, he sat up, his pre-prepared speech in his hands. Takagi read, "it is my formal duty, as the Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan, to announce this opening of the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet. It is in this moment that I wish to, in front of you, our most noble servants of the Emperor, address what changes are to be expected under my administration in comparison to those of old. It is no secret that I, and those in my administration, believe that the nature and systems of our nation, as they currently stand, are unsustainable. The corruption of Hiroya Ino's government, and the interference of the government in the market, cannot stand if we wish for our nation to truly prosper..."\n\nAlready, just a few sentences into his speech, and the House of Peers was in uproar. What was, at first, whisperings between Peers, became conversations and underhanded mockery in an instant. Takagi was stunned. Where was the noble stoicism? Were the Peers not to be quiet servants of the Empire? Takagi looked around with confusion, the bickering of the Peers giving him head pain he had only experienced after long, grueling arguments in the lower house. Have we fallen, or were we always this low?"

 jappmtakagi.52.d:0 ""So, you want to be the Prime Minister, I hear? There's a few 'steps' you oughta take if you want success in that... field. First, let's say you have a bill! Budget, infrastructure, anti-corruption measures, it doesn't matter what the bill contains, it won't change the result. So, you got a bill you wanna pass, but no one else does. You see, our ever-humble public servants have found it to be most profitable to sell their votes. What you and I know as 'government' is, in reality, an auction building. Our tax dollars flow up and into the blender of the Diet, to be distributed to whichever politician's vote is most important. You don't have to be rich to play the game, to dance that fandango just use your second bank account, otherwise known as the 'treasury'. Once your allies are salted with cash, time to move onto the hardballs. To get those bastards on board, whip out the pork barrel, and start funneling cash into their hands for 'administrative purposes'. Alright, you still don't have the votes, time to do some favors. A fishing regulation here, an unbanning of underground bureaucratic channels there, whatever needs to be shoved into the bill to get it to pass. Keep ramming it in, and nothing can go wro- was that the flash of a camera I heard? Uh-oh, the press is on your tail, time to start flooding all the media channels you know with cash and hoping they don't release evidence of your corruption. But... if they do release the evidence, just claim that you and your cronies deserve the extra money for your hard and dedicated efforts in improving the nation. The bill is on the Diet floor now, and sure to pass. By the way, what was this bill about again? Who cares. Your job as an administrator has been fulfilled. Now, let us move onto the House of Peers..."\n\nTakagi grimaced as he read over the satirical comic. It was an underground publication, backed by American money. Even so, large parts of it rung true. Corruption was an ever-present spectre in legislative matters. No matter how much Takagi didn't want to be involved, he was forced to "dance that fandango," as the comic stated, in order to be anything more than a figurehead Prime Minister."

And now, early in the morning, I've been dragged out to this boardroom to listen to my cabinet. Kido has hijacked the meeting, because of course he has, to vent out his whiny, incessant complaints. Oh, how I wish I could tell him I just do not care. My premiership isn't his vehicle to get whatever he wants. And he wants... what exactly? I can't land a finger on his pulse, his goals are beyond me, but whatever they are, I have no interest in fulfilling them.\n\nOut of the ear-piercing cacophony of Kido's rant, dulcet tones ring out. Nakasone interjected. The kid could be annoying at times, but anything would be better than goddamn Kido. He slips over a bundle of papers, a proposal he's been cooking up, no doubt.\n\n"If I may, my apologies Kido, but I would like to bring up the subject of a new economic reform that I have been researching for the past few weeks." Of course. "Basically, the premise is that we loosen price controls, and the market will use the extra room in order to situate on the most consumer and market-friendly prices themselves. Surprisingly, after looking into it, such a policy would yield an uptick in Gross Domestic Product yet unseen in our administration."\n\nYeah, no it wouldn't. But... after a couple sessions with Nakasone, his free-market leanings have been rubbing off on me. I am sure he's done his research, as would anybody interested in price controls. I rub my eyes, and write my signature on his proposal. Consider it a test of what could be, or a hint of what's to come.\n\nI look back to Kido, and my mistake hits me. His eyes flicker between me and Nakasone, all while he trembles. He is seething with an envious rage. Quickly, as he's opening his mouth, I interject."

 jappmtakagi.54.t:0 "The Waves That Could've Been"
 jappmtakagi.54.d:0 "Takagi stared at the brick and marble frontside of a long, stumpy building. This institution, the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, served as his home and learning environment for several years. The paint was wearing, the stones eroding, and the roof tiles breaking off. It was a monument to a simple, idealistic past which, in reality, never existed. Walking through its front doors, Takagi was sent on a nostalgia trip. A young man, who believed that he could transform the IJN from the inside, who would go on to see his innocence and naivety ripped from him in the fire and blood of empire.\n\nIt was in those classrooms that he was taught absolute discipline and the strategies of naval warfare. He remembered the long-dead teachers who saw to it that he would grow up to be an honorable servant of the Emperor. It was in those cafeterias that he ate salted rice for years on end to train his instinctual desires. Looking over the walls, he spotted photos of his class, fifty years ago. Young men, old friends, smiling towards the future. Some died in the East Asia War. Most drifted apart. This was a somber place, more so than he remembered.\n\nWhile examining a model of the battleship Yamato, Takagi noticed a figure in the empty halls of the academy. A janitor, mopping the floors. Looking him over, seeing his slow, cyclic movements, Takagi felt a strange sensation. This man, whoever he was, reminded him of his younger self, but a younger self that could never feel the glory of the Empire nor the hope of social mobility. This man could have been the next great admiral or at least a dedicated sailor. Instead, this janitor, who looks to be in his 30s, has had his life ended right here, in these halls.\n\nTakagi walked out, his head down, as dedicated as he was those fifty years ago. Educational opportunities would be expanded, and he would make sure his cabinet saw it through. No more languishing. He had the power, and it was time to do what he could only wish for as a young man."

 jappmtakagi.100.d:0 "Tokyo was now in the midst of its grand redevelopment. Great swathes of the city had essentially been leveled and dug up. New electrical wiring and sewage systems had begun to fill the ground beneath Tokyo, above which came the new streets and buildings. The capital was beginning to gain the verticality of a modern city, but the changes had not gone unchallenged. Among the many districts deemed suitable for redevelopment was Asakusa, a district of the Taito ward. Not only was the area to be extensively modernized, it was to receive another train line, the first of many to be added to the metro network. This new section of the network would connect the city center with the southern residential areas. The announcement of the Toei Asakusa line had, like much of the development work, been advertised heavily. Asakusa's streets were dotted with billboards and neon lights hailing the meto's imminent arrival. Yet the populace had not been keen to see it or much else of the development.\n\nSince work had begun, the district had been rocked by protests. Beloved buildings, designated for demolition, were occupied by locals, and it was not uncommon for construction workers to be stopped from working by large crowds. Some of the crews had even laid down their tools and joined the Asakusans. The center of the protests was at the Senso-ji Buddhist temple, where residents of Asakusa maintained a constant encampment.\n\nWith construction beginning to fall well behind schedule, pressure was now on Prime Minister Takagi's government to respond with decisive action. Investors and developers were adamant that the Prime Minister should respond with force to bring a swift end to the delays. Yet other voices suggested that sending in riot police and strike-breakers would defeat the point of any development. A tactful and populist gesture would be to make a donation to the Senso-ji temple, and make some accommodations for the people of Asakusa."

After a sigh, he slung his arm forward to reach for the folder, scowling at the uncertain gaze of the police commissioners who had gathered in his presence to discuss the unrest. As he flicked through the files, one of the men piped up with a rough voice, stuttering out a suggestion.\n\n"Prime Minister, we do advise that we take caution with these groups; force may push them further to radicalism. At this moment, they are in a position to be talked to and negotiated with - something that could be used to our advantage. If we set the example here, by limiting our force and compromising with the citizens, we may find a solution and a way out of this mess for good."\n\nThe words of the man irked Takagi, but he was right; perhaps putting down the batons and hoses would be a better idea. Sweat clung to his body and a shivery prickle ran down his back. The soreness of his eyes ached from beneath his skull.

The youth of today were born in the Emperor's victory, a time of unique peace and prosperity, but they knew war just like any generation before.\n\nMilitarism had entrenched itself into society during the Great East Asian War, and its warring culture had now coalesced around the youth. IJA and IJN recruitment is rife in universities, well-established in libraries, and praised by the government itself. With a cemented, undying devotion to defending East Asia, propping up their fathers' military conquests had developed a pride in these young men that only violence could satiate.\n\nWith Japan's rising affluence in the twentieth century, urbanisation had risen as populations flocked into cities. Travelling from rural communities, many young people had come in search of wealth, employment, or a new start. The mingling of these varied forms of language, mannerisms, and personal philosophies created a distinctively eccentric class of urbanites loyal to the Imperial throne.\n\nHowever, it has been observed that groups in universities, theatres, and youth organisations have developed an odd affinity for American culture. Smuggled literature is distributed in secret, jazz music has seen a resurgence along with popular American tunes, and some have even begun to cut their hair in American styles and use American words.\n\nThe youth of Tokyo have come to represent the most idiosyncratic aspects of the fringes of Japanese society, but as absurd as the youth seems, they remain committed to the Emperor, and to Japan."

Even Chiyoda, the special ward of Tokyo that contained the Imperial Palace, was to see extensive construction work. Parts of the National Gardens would be redeveloped to better accommodate the metro at Tokyo station, as well as a number of new roads. These wer e to allow for traffic to better flow through the heart of the capital. Maintenance work was to be done on all key government buildings. Not only were the roads leading to these vital centers to be completely replaced, but the buildings themselves were to receive expensive renovations.\n\nChiyoda's small population made it fairly easy for contractors and the to proceed with their plan without much popular discontent. Instead, it was the Imperial Household Ministry who keenly expressed displeasure with the redevelopment. The grounds had largely remained the same since the Chrysanthemum throne's move to Tokyo and it seemed as if the ministry would resist any attempt to change that fact.\n\nAlready, the Prime Minister had received numerous complaints from the minister, all containing demands to remove the Palace grounds from the development plan entirely. Parts of the cabinet, including Koichi Kido, felt that making some accommodations for the Imperial Palace would be reasonable enough. Development could then carry on without the threat of Imperial disapproval hanging over the entire operation. Other voices, notably the new guard liberals, were adamant to not surrender to the Imperial household ministry. They instead proposed that the Prime Minister stand his ground, possibly make a few bribes and simply wait for the letters of objection to cease. With no one wishing to see construction to grind to a halt, Prime Minister Takagi would need to make his decision immediately."

By night, the white haze of street lights illuminated the once darkened areas of the city, and thousands flocked to fill their bellies in the restaurants with warm foods not provided in ration-packs.\n\nThe city moved faster, worked harder, and seemed much happier to have benefitted from these infrastructural improvements. The percentage of homes with access to electricity, adequate sanitation, and central heating increased significantly, and these improvements were certainly recognised.

He leaned over slightly to his side as he pressed his fingers into his back to massage his sore body, now he could rest knowing the task was complete.\n\nThe TEPCO negotiations had come to a conclusion in the fateful hours preceding Takagi's breather, and an agreement had finally been made. With the ink still fresh on the papers resting on his desk, the flickering recent memories of shaking hands over the table were a personal victory for the Prime Minister, as well as a political one. His heavy eyelids grew heavier; Takagi peered out of the slither of vision unclaimed by his fatigue to glance once more at the clauses and statements freckling the signed agreement.\n\nTokyo was to have its power grids restructured and reconfigured, so that the city could generate and use more electricity whilst keeping waste and cost at a minimum. For the benefit of the city's citizenry, and the businesses that draw in billions of Yen each year, electricity would be made more affordable and accessible.

We've practically stomped out corruption from the dark corners of the Diet and Civil Service, and the economy has more or less recovered. May we drink to that tonight."\n\nThe cabinet sat with the Prime Minister, sipping on glasses of champagne and leaning back in their circle of chairs.

He flicked through the piece, trying to find humor in its ridiculous claims and outrageous accusations.

Wielding a presentation pointer, he commanded the room's attention to pie charts of revenue diversification, bar graphs of income in each region, and line graphs predicting the growth of the Japanese economy in the next few fiscal years. Waving his hands in front of him while explaining the potential of the Japanese market share, his crooked smile crept across his face, pleased with the recognition he had now achieved.\n\nAfter a moment of small applause ended abruptly by the Prime Minister, Nakasone continued his speech with Takagi's begrudging permission. He cleared his throat and unveiled a new selection of graphs, grinning like a child showing off his new toys.

Takagi knew he couldn't win every battle, and thought that perhaps Nakasone had a point.

We clearly need not look beyond opinion in the Diet and among lobbyists; this is exactly what they want. We command their support for these liberalizations, and it is sure to bring Japan riches. To shy away from this... well I don't think we'd last for much longer in the seats we are sitting in. Now, with the economic developments throughout the Empire stabilizing, we are taking this as a green light to-"\n\n"Nakasone." the Prime Minister interrupted, visibly irritated and knowing he must concede, "What do you want here?" A dull silence followed. "Do you seriously think I want to hear this right now?""

 japtakagirecon.6.d:0 "Nakasone sat in a dim dining room filled with cigar smoke, illuminated with a gloomy yellow light and surrounded by relaxed and sleazy tycoons. These men were the leading figures in Japan's keiretsu firms; their secret agreements fattened their profits by the second as their corporate influence began to stretch across the Empire. They clinked champagne glasses and grumbled to each other, lightly snacking on the extravagant refreshments prepared for the occasion. Nakasone, eager to begin his consultation, stood up from his seat and clinked on his glass to gather the room's attention.\n\n"Gentlemen. Our government has gone forward with plans to free our choked-up economy. Deregulation. Privatization. You've heard it all before, and now it's happening."\n\nHe continued with his speech, and as he preached of economic reform, the businessmen's grins grew hungrier; it was only a matter of time before vicious, yet immensely profitable, competition could begin. The slouched men sat forward with their attention firmly commanded by the bright and beautiful words of the Nakasone. Their eyes sparkled and glistened, looking like piranhas ready to dart at any moment. By the end of his address, the men applauded Nakasone with a passion like no other. Though they appeared to support the movements of the government, with some even getting up to shake Nakasone's hand and chuckle, it was clear they craved only one thing - the sooner the deregulation came, the sooner they could sink their teeth into each other's profits. There was an odd shift of control in the area; the now upright tycoons mingled as experts in their fields, as enemies in public, but as allies at least for now. Nakasone felt a sense of achievement as he had the support of these men, but suddenly and frighteningly in that gloomy amber room, he felt outnumbered."

 japtakagirecon.7.d:0 "Nakasone anxiously stood at present in front of a boardroom table, at which delegates from Mutsui, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo looked on with steely boredom. He trembled, as if a schoolboy preparing to give a speech in front of class. It had taken a lot of effort to wrangle together the big four, or big three more accurately, to hear out his proposal. The delegates were, to put it lightly, ancient. The old men, veterans of decades of corporate struggle and Zaibatsu antics, fiddled with their pens and straightened their papers as Nakasone coughed to prepare his voice.\n\n"G-gentlemen, we sit here today to discuss the possibilities presented to the free market by the deregulation and privatization policies of Sōkichi Takagi's government. We in the administration look to the private sector as the next area of reform if we are to maintain the prosperity and growth of Japan and the Dai Tōa Kyōei Ken."\n\nNakasone continued on, as smarmy as ever, hoping to curry favor with these titans of industry. He flicked through his pre-prepared presentation, until suddenly, the remote clicker stopped working. He coughed again, and laughed nervously as beads of sweat rolled off his face.\n\n"W-well-"\n\nThe snapping turtles, at last, spoke up. "I think I speak for all of us when I say that this proposal is, indeed, intriguing, but it is clear you have no understanding of how such an operation should be completed and what its goals should be. You treat economic reform like a boy wielding his father's gun. We would not like to conduct business with a partner who operates in ignorance of the realities of the market, good day." The old men shoved their papers into their suitcases, and promptly shuffled out. Only one delegate, that of Sumitomo, remained. Sumitomo's delegate walked up to Nakasone, who was, at the moment, sulking in place, and put his hand on Nakasone's shoulder.\n\n"Listen, just between you and me, I hate those old bastards. Let me get Sumitomo in on your deal, alright? The only future they see is one of absolute domination, but I think we both know the path Japan is going down.""

 japtakagirecon.8.d:0 "Takagi, once again, found himself staring down Nakasone as he half-demanded, half-begged for the fulfillment of another one of his proposals. This was getting ridiculous. They sat in the dining car of a train transporting them to one of Takagi's media channels, for Takagi would see to it that his public relations didn't deteriorate following the recent... changes. This was supposed to be a break, where they could relax and eat expensive appetizers. But, as with all things, Nakasone transformed it into work. He kept bringing up his agreements with the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus, and the four pillars of the free market, and so forth. Nakasone would never be satisfied.\n\n"Takagi, listen. Sumitomo and all of the Keiretsus have agreed to our proposal. The market is waiting for us to fulfill our end of the deal. Reforming Japan necessitates the expansion and growth of the free market. And, even if you don't fully agree that liberalization of the economy is a necessity, you must admit that making deals and then dropping them isn't going to bode well for our political relationships."\n\n"You," Takagi states as he points his bony finger towards Nakasone. "You made the deals, not me. You are the one who pushed me into this corner. I don't have time to clean up the messes from your personal adventures, Nakasone!" Takagi breathes in, and restrains his behavior. "Nakasone... I am simply concerned with the policies that you are diving head-first into. Look at Manchukuo, Showa Steel Works and Mantetsu hold absolute domination over the area, and the living conditions are awful, and will stay awful. All I am saying is that you are blindly trusting these corporations out of dedication to the free market. Noble, sure, but very naive."\n\n"That is why we must hurry to liberalize the market. As soon as competition can be introduced, we can prevent the rise of monopolistic enterprises, the likes in Manchukuo... do you follow me, Takagi?"\n\nTakagi sat in silence, looking over the rolling landscape of the Japanese countryside." I am going to regret this, but... you may, Nakasone, keep going forward with your proposal. Now, may we finally order a meal?""

A procession of the navy's men marched towards Showa Steel's headquarters, disarming or strong-arming all guards positioned in the facility. The procession, led by a smiling gentlemen in business attire, forcefully entered the headquarters and marched to the office of the head of the facility. What the head operator did not expect was that Yasuhiro Nakasone, the Minister of Finance, was commanding the occupation.\n\nAs nonchalantly as humanly possible, Nakasone entered the office of the head operator, and began giving out orders. This whole operation was unapologetic thuggery acting under the guise of administrative formality.\n\n"Hello, my name is Yasuhiro Nakasone, I expect you to be the head of this facility. I am acting on behalf of a government commission, the goal of which is the prosperity and growth of our nation's free market and entrepreneurial enterprises. I come to you with a... proposal. I am humbly asking you, and the body you work for, to consider the privatization of your facilities." With the word 'privatization,' the navy's men pulled out their pistols and a bundle of papers was then laid on the head operator's desk. The bundle contained within a series of forged entries and reports which attested to the incompetence of the administration of the steelworks.\n\nNakasone then turned to the office window. Looking over the bursts of smog, the heat blasting from the furnaces, the smashing of metal, and the roaring machines, Nakasone felt satisfaction. The might of industry, the delight of mass production. The economist's dream. Looking back to the navy's men, he nodded his head. They shot into the ceiling of the office, which then followed with the cracking of gunshots across the facility.\n\nThe head operator was agape with terror and confusion. Nakasone turned to leave, remarking, "This needs to be done, sir, I hope you can understand. The future is upon us, and I only want to make our transition easier.""

 japtakagirecon.10.d:0 "Here he was, again. It was always again and again and again. This was his Sisyphean task, his personal Hell. Life was only an interlude between these moments, it seemed. Takagi, stuck in his desk, listening to another one of Nakasone's proposals. Various reports, statistics, graphs, and whatnot were scattered all over the office. Takagi questioned Nakasone's mental integrity. Did Nakasone really think he was going to look over all this data, or did he just want a lot of random statistics to make his argument sound more convincing. Wait, was he doing that the entire time?\n\n"Please, Takagi, pay attention. Essentially, the point of this proposal is a reduction in government spending and bloat across the board. The smaller the government is, the less the next government will be able to undo our reforms, and the less the next government will be able to interfere with the free market."\n\nTakagi truly wondered if Nakasone dreamt of the words 'free market' while sleeping. How many times had those words pierced his ears and burrowed into his skull.\n\n"Now, a key to this proposal is cutting the budget of the army. It is no secret that the army is a reactionary organization that would only undo our reforms if given the chance. Not to mention that the army is consuming unimaginable proportions of our budget already, and as such, we could do with trimming that fat. Government subsidies, too, must be cut. Or, at least the subsidies to unloyal firms. To avoid the publicity hit, I suggest we do it behind the scenes, disguising the cuts as business actions taken on behalf of bad projections. Of course, we should also consider cutting..."\n\nTakagi had heard enough. If this proposal would undermine the army's influence and satisfy Nakasone's lust for a freer market, then it already had more upsides than whatever downsides the rest of the proposal could contain.\n\n"Alright, Nakasone. You may move forward with your proposal, although, ultimately, it isn't my decision whether or not this proposal will pass into law. Do keep in mind, I won't fight your battles for you. You are going to be the one to dance the fandango, this time around. Nakasone, I want to welcome you to the bloodiest battlefield our nation has to offer.""

It was, at last, time to present his comprehensive program to cut the bloat. The army would suffer under the proposal, so he expected to experience resistance from the army's sympathizers, especially Ikeda's conservative faction and the so-called "reform bureaucrats." The whole Diet was and not to be trusted for any longer than it took for the cash in their pocket to burn up.\n\nHe had a plan, however. A plan to rock the lower house, to wield his charm and charisma to command a majority. Takagi would see that he could do it, that he was capable, that he could master the blood court. Stepping onto the central speaking platform, Nakasone unleashed his smile, as bright as he could muster it.\n\n"Hello, I am Yasuhiro Nakasone, for the remainder of this session I will be speaking on behalf of the Sōkichi Takagi government. I have called upon the House of Representatives to discuss the merits, and ultimately approve or deny, a budgetary reform which will, as is included in the folders in front of you all, cut unnecessary bloat throughout the entire government structure."\n\nThe House of Representatives erupted. The reform bureaucrats exploded at the premise of weakening the government and the army especially. In order to counteract the jeers and boos of the reform bureaucrats, Takagi's liberal faction cheered Nakasone on. The Kidoites waited to see what would happen, while the independents crumbled into factions. Ikeda's conservatives, the kingmakers, waited for Ikeda himself to make a decision.\n\nFollowing the wait, Ikeda descended the steps in order to meet with Nakasone. Upon reaching the speaking platform, Ikeda slung his hand on Nakasone's shoulder, and smiled. The House of Representatives transformed into pandemonium on Earth, but eventually, the applause beat out the screams of the decriers. A surprise to be sure, but it seems that the conservatives, too, dislike the unsustainable state of the budget. All was going to plan."

The conservatives and like-minded independents came down too, if only to prevent the breakout of a fight. The Kidoites, for their part, sat still and awaited further developments.\n\nOut of the crowd of reform bureaucrats, Nakasone witnessed a figure emerging to challenge his position on the speaking platform, with dead eyes and a leathery, bloated custard sack of a neck. He wore colorless business attire and expressed all emotion in the boundaries of bureaucratic decorum. Nobusuke Kishi, the leader of the reform bureaucrats, was here to face the new blood.\n\nNakasone readied himself and in typical fashion entered the conversation headfirst. "Nobusuke Kishi. I expect you to present a list of reasonable complaints against my proposal, but, let's be honest, you're going to act like I spat on the Emperor's shoes for merely suggesting the budget be reformed."\n\nKishi got as close as he could to Nakasone. He stared forward, ignoring Nakasone's comments. "Don't act like I don't know what you're doing. You think you can just walk up and sway the Diet by preaching nothing but blind ideology. You have the disposition of an arrogant schoolboy. You need someone to check your ever-expanding ego, and I would be all but too glad to rip apart this proposal, your list of fever dreams, in front of the crowds and cameras. Run off, boy, before you reveal to the nation your idiocy."\n\nThe crowd undulated with excitement, rage and rancor. Screams bursted out from across the mob. Nakasone, taken aback, retreated from the speaking platform. He didn't look back to the lower house, instead leaving the House of Representatives as quietly as he entered. The plan didn't work, and only Takagi would know what to do now."

I need you, Takagi, if I'm going to get out of this mess."\n\nTakagi looked up from his papers and breathed in, the disappointment palpable. "If you knew what I said, why did you come to ask me? Nakasone, I meant it. You can't keep doing this, launching into proposals and projects of your own initiative and expecting me to bear the effects of your decisions. I'm done with this game, Nakasone, I'm finished."\n\nNakasone stepped forward, his shadow now looming over Takagi. "I wouldn't be doing this alone if you ever actually listened to me. You can't keep ignoring the future, Takagi. Our economy grows more and more interconnected with the Sphere and beyond by the day, and yet I'm the only one to see it and to prepare us for that inevitability. We're going to be destroyed by it if we don't do something. I'm begging you, Takagi, our nation needs this. I... I need this."\n\nTakagi stood up from his desk, towering over Nakasone. "Who do you think I am, Nakasone. Your puppet? Your tool? This is my premiership at stake. Threatening businesses, dealing with Zaibatsus and Keiretsus, risking everything on the market. I am the one who has to cover for your antics, for the gambles you take. Days of speeches, hours on camera, just because of you. You, Nakasone. I can't keep killing myself over a child who thinks he's a politician."\n\nNakasone was stunned. Takagi. Takagi, the man he looked up to, the man who always knew what to do, using the same lines as that bastard Kishi. Nakasone backed away, staring at the carpet. Upon reaching the hallway, Kido passed him. He put his hand on Nakasone's shoulder and whispered, "I'm going to see what I can do. You go out there, and rouse support.

That's all you must do. Calm down, do not panic, and turn the handle.\n\nNakasone swung open the doors. The representatives of the lower house, all of them, stared in silence. Nakasone made his way down towards the central speaking platform. Kishi and his cronies were already waiting there as Kishi gave a speech in opposition to the proposal. Nakasone could not contain his fury, his bitter resentment. Upon seeing Nakasone, Kishi remarked "Here we see, Nakasone returns. I expect he will want to give a few words, sadly, he already was given the opportunity to give a speech and relinquished it."\n\nNakasone ignored Kishi, and moved to meet him on the speaking platform. "My dear friend, Nobusuke Kishi, has unfortunately, as in many things, overestimated the poignance of his words and the skill inherent to him. My proposal would not, in any dramatic effect, weaken our military capabilities or the effectiveness of our government. The goal is to cut bloat. If you have a meal with a rotten ingredient, removing the ingredient will not weaken the quality of the meal, only improve it."\n\nKishi whispered to Nakasone, "You remain a child in all things, even your metaphors speak of immaturity."\n\nNakasone stared forward. The emotions bubbled from within, but through mental fortitude, he restrained himself. "You know, behind your facade, I would bet you envy youth. In fact, I know you do."\n\nSuddenly, a representative ran into the chamber, shouting for the lower house's attention. The nobles had spoken out in favor of the proposal. All conversations were broken by fierce applause, originating from the liberal faction.

Having actually scheduled a proper meeting with Takagi, Nakasone was now certain that he could make himself properly heard.\n\n"Prime Minister, I know I have made the point many times before, but I still feel you need to understand why my policies are so vital. It is a matter of the nation's survival."\n\nTakagi had little to offer his finance minister than a nod, signalling him to continue his business pitch"\n\n"The world economy is headed towards a cataclysm, but it can be avoided if we take the proper steps.

Set the economy free, let competition and innovation flourish!"\n\nNakasone presented his rather dramatic case with great emphasis on the dangers of what he proposed was to come. Takagi could even register that the minister was being quite earnest, despite his hyperbolic delivery. Noting that Nakasone had finally stopped talking, the Prime Minister considered what he had been told. Were he to refuse to liberalize the economy further, then Nakasone would invariably continue to plead his case whenever he got the chance. There was no point in refusing.

The Prime Minister was indeed listening carefully, despite the fact that he could not have cared less about such a minor matter.\n\nThe Finance Minister carried on with his speech, utilising a number of reports he had commissioned to reinforce his argument. To Prime Minister Takagi, the information they contained was at best dull and at worst meaningless. Once he had had enough of the reports, he interrupted Nakasone.

Both of the men chattered of their fishing pastimes in the Tokyo Bay, and reminisced of a past that had now been taken from them.\n\nThe men sat there for hours, gazing at the countless freighter ships hauling in thousands of tonnes of shipment in each hour and discussed how this had changed everything. Akito expressed his anger that there was no more space left for fishermen like him, as the great ships would crush his vessel without even noticing. Eizo was silent, and then grunted in agreement; he insisted that it was a great shame that the nation had forgotten its history of small fishing communities. Both of the old men sipped their teas and continued to watch the great stretches of the Pacific waters, occasionally pointing at a bird or another freighter ship charging into the bay.\n\nThey didn't bother bringing any fishing equipment with them, as their cynicism had already judged the government had replaced any desire to support fishing communities with the profits of off-shore fishing operations and using the ports for shipping. In fact, these men were far too old to even climb down to the harbor to fish. They had no choice but to watch the buoys dance in the distant waters and listen to the gusts of ocean winds as prisoners of their old age. Akito and Eizo both grumbled as ships continued to sail in and dock in Tokyo's harbors, but they knew their age had eclipsed anything they could do to bring them back out to sea."

Today, he was especially interested in the Middle East. While politically dominated by the Italians, much of the region was open to trade and investment by foreign companies. However, very few companies had actually taken the opportunity to do just that. This was a fine chance for Japan to step in.\n\nThe Middle East was free of many restrictions and protections that Nakasone considered a great pain for businesses in Japan. With just a foot in the door, the Keiretsu and Zaibatsu would be free to operate at their peak of their potential efficiency. While this would initially provide Japan with merely more cheap labour, the Middle East was in truth offering much more. Precious resources, such as oil, were just waiting beneath the surface to be extracted. Best of all, it could be done without time being wasted on petty regulations and worries about fair deals with local populations. Japan could soon have itself a gigantic stockpile of oil that it so desperately needed, all to be had at a fine price.\n\nRealising that such an idea was best put into motion without a moment of delay, he began to search through his book of contacts for just the right people to call. Once they were made to be in the know, the wheels of great profits would once again begin spinning at an incredible rate. The Finance Minister could not help but smile at his own plan."

Another leans back on his wooden stool, his spine against the chipping paint of the wall. They toss polished and tightly wound grenades between their hands, and stare at a wooden table covered in high-tech weaponry between them. This stuff was better than what the government could afford, even. They glanced at each other in an amused confusion. Sure, they had bargained with contacts before, oil and intel in exchange for guns, bread and butter. This was a little different. All the guns and bullets they usually got were sub-par, to put it lightly. Caked in dust, lots of duds, chips in the metal and, as was normal, some bullets were missing here or there.\n\nThis, now this was manna from heaven.

Yeah, the government is bending over backwards for them, but maybe they're getting suspicious.

Among the crowds and observing from the boxes overlooking the stage sat Prime Minister Takagi with the company of Nakasone. The actors twirled and flew across the stage, bringing a serene calm to the Prime Minister as he could soak up these artistic pleasures as a break from his administrative duties. The same could not be said for Nakasone, as he constantly wriggled around his chair and critiqued every feature he could in a naive attempt to impress Takagi.\n\nJust as a period of silence fell over the two and the Prime Minister could return his attention to the actors, Nakasone pointed out the symbols of wealth the actors bore and began to mumble about complex economic systems and taxation across the Empire. Tired of returning banal platitudes, Takagi turned his head to gaze at Nakasone with an empty expression. Only encouraging the man, Nakasone pulled out a handkerchief and scribbled a rough graph in a weak black ink. Takagi, lost for words at how inappropriate Nakasone's incessant ramblings were, could only pick up the words 'Rolle's theorem' from the distorted whispers distracting him from the drum of the Tsuzumi. The scribbled handkerchief was placed on the Prime Minister's arm rest as Nakasone continued to babble over intricacies of taxation levels across Japan, seemingly unaware the Kabuki theater was still airing a performance. Embarrassed by Nakasone's ignorance of his surroundings, and as the stringing of the Shamisen grew more intense, Takagi grabbed the handkerchief and leaned over to Nakasone, interrupting him with an dry and low grumble:\n\n"Look, I'll cut taxes and regulations. Just shut up for now.""

The sweatshop was hidden away in the gaps between several taller buildings, as if they were shielding an unpleasant sight from the eyes of more "dignified" people. After arriving, Kajiwara sat herself down at her workstation and began to sow. To her left was a giant pile of shoe pieces which she was expected to make into footwear by the end of the day. As Kajiwara worked, she would occasionally glance towards the back of the cavernous room. That section of the sweatshop had been turned into a makeshift office for her supervisor, Mr Handa. When he was not enjoying the cool air from the fan upon his desk, Mr Handa would patrol the sweatshop floor. While scanning the workers, he would casually twirl the stick he carried in his right hand, a reminder of just how much power he held in that room.\n\nWork in the oppressively humid climate carried on mostly as normal for Kajiwara. She worked quicker than she might have usually done. She had missed her quota last week, and the thought of repeating that mistake was terrifying. Her grueling shift carried on until just after sunset, and the pile of shoe parts was just about gone. As she was about to finish her work, the stick carried by Handa slammed down on the table, sending the last pieces of leather flying.\n\n"Kajiwara, I just checked the record and I realised you didn't make the quota last week. It doesn't seem like you'll manage it this week either. I think it's time we made an example out of you."\n\nThe sweatshop workers were forcefully beckoned to watch as Handa prepared to strike his employer across the hand with his stick. The beating provoked little more than a gasp from Kajiwara as she knew that showing any sign of weakness would only prolong her torment. She returned home later that night and hoped her hand would heal enough for the next shift."

He glanced over the rows of chattering machines, each one manned by a famished and sweaty worker toiling for hours without break. The intense buzz in the air formed a thick mist; industrial chemicals seeping from the churns of production appliances were an awful stench filling Nakasone's nose. He covered his face in disgust, and awkwardly smiled back at his company of advisors, before again gazing at the filthy and cramped factory floor.\n\nThe manager of the sweatshop approached the group of men from the railing's stairs and, with a heavy hand, shook Nakasone's hand, greeting him and thanking him for his visit. Nakasone, in the presence of a fellow business-orientated mind, smiled back and chuckled, and began to confess his appreciation of the great output of the manager's industrial facility. Both the men grinned, and began to talk of plans for the state-backed expansion of the plant in a series of programs to develop the economy. Nakasone and the manager talked for a long while, until the exhausted workers around the factory seemed more interested in the government visit than in their laborious work.\n\nNoticing and signalling a colleague, the manager ordered the workers back to their stations in a blustering scream, and the fatigued operators were hurried back to their buzzing machines. Yelling and shrieking followed, causing a small ruckus before being dissipated by other members of staff dragging workers away to be punished. To Nakasone and his party of advisors, this was a great display of modern industrial discipline and they began to applaud the manager's skill. He returned to the manager with a soft grin, and continued announcing government plans to develop the facility for even greater output."

 japtakagirecon.24.d:0 "When Japan was isolated, immigration was tight and foreign trade was outlawed, it was a backwater, a time capsule to the feudal hierarchies and caste systems of the 1600s. Japan's ramparts against progress and change were broken with the arrival of the Western World. The imperialists, originating from the West, took it upon themselves to form pseudo-colonies out of China and Japan, economic slaves for their mercantile greed. China was made a drug-addicted shell of its former self, the West claiming entire cities for themselves, and carving it into spheres of influence. Japan would not fall to that fate.\n\nThe arrival of the West was a necessary baptism of fire, for it taught Japan what they needed to do to survive in this world of the strong and weak. Undergoing an industrial revolution in a few decades, Japan was determined to make itself into a regional power. Prepared to expand and feed Japan's burgeoning industry, the governments of Japan went on adventures of conquest, from Taiwan to Korea, Manchuria to Micronesia. The Konoe and Tojo governments formed our modern Japan, from the dominance of the Zaibatsus and the Keiretsus, to masterhood over Asia.\n\nWith triumph, Japan rested complacent with its conquests, and with complacence, Japan's industry has stagnated and declined. The Zaibatsus and Keiretsus are only interested in lands abroad, from Guangdong to China to Vietnam. Without reason to develop the Home Islands, they have abandoned our nation to its current state of industry, dating back to the 1930s. With the economically liberalizing reforms of Minister of Finance Nakasone, this slide into the abyss has been counteracted. Fresh and productive industrial plants have popped up throughout Japan's cities. Pustules of industry have appeared across the face of our nation, and are only expanding. If pollution and terrible working conditions are what is necessary for our nation to take the next step in history, Nakasone is prepared to make that sacrifice."

He walked out to the balcony of the high-rise luxury hotel he would be staying in for the night, dripping wet from a recent dip in the hotel jacuzzi. This would be his night to celebrate how far he had come. In his time as Minister of Finance, Japan had entered into a period of economic liberalization beyond his wildest dreams as a political flunkie, only a few years ago. The night air was frigid and gnawed at his skin, but it could not overpower his delight. Looking over the Tokyo skyline, Nakasone saw something so magnificent he could hardly contain his awe. Where once Tokyo was a city of poor fisherman and the scattered nobleman, it was now a city of lights. Bright yellows originating from the industrial plants, neon reds and blues from the advertisements and signs, and a single, piercing green light from across the bayside. The might of industry had overtaken Tokyo, and oh, what a sight it was. A people transformed, a nation elevated.\n\nLooking into the dark blue night sky, Nakasone did not feel the same sensations he had overlooking Tokyo. Where were the stars? He glanced around, something was wrong about this all. Staring at the industrial plants, all he could notice now were the endless plumes of smog, always floating upwards and then dissipating into the Tokyo air. He felt his throat tighten, and began to cough violently and uncontrollably. Putting his weight on the balcony railing, he dropped his bottle of champagne off the side of the hotel with a limp wrist.\n\nA flurry of chilly wind hit his emplacement, seemingly transforming the water dripping down his body into streams of ice-cold frost, which burnt into his skin. He tightened the ends of his bathrobe, but no matter what he did, the freezing air would not go away. Doubts overtook his mind. Was he dragging Japan down the right path? The people suffered, and he knew it. Nothing had improved. Oh, and what of Takagi? There was never any 'compromise'; he forced Takagi to do what he wanted. He had manipulated them, he had ruined them. The cold was never going to go away, not now. It was always him."

Still as ever, the Prime Minister called out to Nakasone, but he did not answer; his breath only drew heavier gasps of air.\n\nTakagi opened his eyes and raised his brow, concerned for his colleague. Nakasone was silent for a moment longer, and then began to confess in a shaken voice of his own shortcomings. Hiding his glossy eyes from the Prime Minister, he slowly explained he believed the erratic pace of economic liberalization across Japan was self-destructive, both for him and the empire. Drawing heavier breaths, he confessed further into his worries and stresses that came with the responsibilities of his office - in particular, wondering if he was going to have to live with the shame of dismissal. Nakasone's head was low and his voice grew weaker, though he continued to face the showering rains just beyond the window's glass.\n\nTakagi stood up from his leather chair and made his way over to Nakasone, standing by his side and staring out of the great window, remaining silent for a moment. Upon hearing a few quiet sniffles, the Prime Minister slowly raised his arm to place his hand on Nakasone's shoulders in an attempt to comfort him. "Moderation," the Prime Minister said lightly to assure Nakasone. Takagi turned his head to look at the minister and smiled, before patting him on the back and returning back to his chair."

They had been lucky to even get the apartment, but with their small corner shop proving fruitful, the Okuma's just about pulled it off. However their good fortune did not last. Each month, they had to perform a careful balancing act of maintaining growth and paying off debts .\n\nWhile they managed their finances for a while without fail, the opening of a much larger store just a few streets down spelled certain doom for their corner shop. Eventually, the time came to explain the coming changes to the children.\n\nThe Okuma's gathered around the dinner table, eating a meal that was much smaller than they had grown accustomed to. The father could not even look up from his plate as he spoke.\n\n"I'm sure you've noticed that your mom and dad have been a bit anxious recently. We haven't been going to work as much and I'm aware you've seen us looking a bit worried when you come home from school. There's a bit less money going around these days and it's getting harder to scrape by.\n\nThe father took the hands of his children and looked them in the eye, trying to look hopeful. The mother chimed in,to take the pressure of her husband. She took a candle out of a small box and handed it to her eldest child.\n\n"We're going to need all three of you to be really strong, okay? When it gets dark, we need to use these now. It'll be cosy and if you get scared, you can sleep in our room." Seeing the tears in the eyes of her husband she knew she would also have to tell her children the hardest part.\n\n"And on the weekends, you're going to have to make do without food. It's not fair, I know. It's going to be so tough, but I know how strong you all are. You're going to be so brave. We promise this won't be like this forever, we really do. We'll find a way to make even more money than before, and then you can eat whatever you like."\n\nEventually, she broke down as well. The children, still too young to truly realise their situation began to suggest that they could work too, or maybe sell some of their toys and clothes.

The writing on the front mentioned something about a ministry, but the Okuma child was too tired to read it properly. Instead, he headed back up the stairs and placed the letter on the table in the kitchen. The boy's father, who's eyes were red from too little sleep and too much crying, dared not flip the envelope when he first saw it, lest it be revealed as another bill. Eventually he gained enough courage to dispel those thoughts, which revealed "Ministry of Finance" on the front of the letter. Curiosity and a spark of hope caused the father to tear upon the envelope without a moment of consideration.\n\nTo Okuma Taro and Chinatsu. You are receiving this letter due to your employment as business owners as well as the difficult situation that you find yourselves in. The government has recently implemented measures aimed at aiding businesses such as yours. Therefore, the ministry of finance has examined your financial situation and decided to subsidize your business. You will soon be receiving a cheque, valued at-"\n\nAs soon as Mr Okuma saw the amount, he called for his wife and children to read the letter too, to make sure that he had not made a mistake.\n\nThe subsidies turned out to be just what the Okuma's needed to save the corner shop. They would no longer have to fear bankruptcy and poverty. Even so, they still were forced to make a difficult choice. The business would not survive in the city, no matter how much support it received. As such, the Okuma's decided to move back to the country, where they would at least be able to live comfortably. As they left their apartment for the last time, the Okuma's hoped that they were not the only ones to have been so lucky."

Currently Nakasone was boring him with another tiresome speech about minor policy changes. Takagi considered this a fine opportunity to change the subject. Tracing a finger from Tokyo, he headed to China and after making a quick sweep of the region, the Prime Minister tapped on a small town in Hubei. The sharpness at which he did this was enough to snap Nakasone to attention, cutting his anecdote about shipping regulation short.\n\n"How do you think the people in that place live, Nakasone? I suspect they all slave away in fields.\n\nNakasone was taken aback by the suddenness of the question, but was quick to provide an answer.\n\n"It is certainly likely that they live in squalor and I suspect you are correct that they do little in terms of productive work. The same could be said of most of the Chinese labour force, it's a complete waste of manpower."\n\nIntrigued by the comments of the Finance Minister, Takagi turned away from the map.\n\n"Do you think they could be put to better use?''\n\n"Indeed they could. Those townsfolk are wasted in the fields. They should be used to industrialize and diversify the local economy. It might even result in them gaining some spending power, which is never a bad thing for a growing economy.\n\nTakagi pleased to hear Nakasone provide him with a decent proposal, without it being marred in excessive detail. Making the Chinese townsfolk more productive was undoubtedly good and if they happened to personally benefit too, then that was quite acceptable.\n\n"Very well, Nakasone.

The company car at the airport had taken him and his assistant directly to the growing industrial district, without as much as a scenic view of the city proper. Nakasone had briefly rolled down the window, but immediately rolled it back up upon inhaling the air. He realised that the hundreds of smoking chimneys should have altered him to not do this in the first place.\n\nThe factories eventually faded away, being replaced by an office complex. At the end of the road was Nakasone's destination, where he would be meeting with the man in charge of the facility he had just passed through. As he stepped out of the car, Nakasone was pleased that the air was considerably more pleasant there, but he did not wish to linger. He was quickly led inside the building to the facility manager's office. The manager himself got out of his chair and swiftly performed a rehearsed bow.\n\n"We are honored that you decided to visit our plant first, Minister. How has your journey been so far?\n\nNakasone, whose schedule included at least a dozen visits to such plants was quick to change to topic.\n\n"Everything has been quite satisfactory. Now, if you do not mind, I would very much like to discuss the matter of requisitioning some of your workforce. This would be a relatively short time contract, just some work aimed at developing the local economy. Before you responded, it should be noted that this is a government matter, one that the Prime Minister has taken great interest in.\n\nAh yes, I understand, Minister. I must ask how I will be compensated for such a deal. This will cost us a great deal of time.\n\nHaving expected to hear such words, Nakasone gestured for his assistant to open the briefcase he was carrying. A mere look at the money contained within was enough for the manager.\n\n"Yes, I think that should do nicely. You have my humblest thanks, minister".

I remember my education consisting of learning how to read and write in a brick room. We had chalkboards to write words, and we were beaten for thinking anything above and beyond what our teacher wanted. It was no way for a child to live. I don't want that for the children of today."\n\nThe Prime Minister continued to speak of his poor upbringing and education, but was not overwhelmed by emotion. Instead, he was rather cold and bitter, seemingly uncaring of the past he no longer lived in. Nakasone, interpreting this as an opportunity to weigh in, compared his childhood to Takagi's; he smirked and spoke of the silly stories and memories he had with friends. He mumbled about learning French in his adolescence and reading the Aeneid, forgetting all but a few words from each, and poking the Prime Minister as he recalled childhood stories of classroom pranks in his peaceful, idyllic youth.\n\nNakasone took a gulp of champagne, knocking his head back as he swallowed, before returning his vision to the Prime Minister.

Language, she assumed, as her son had been piecing together his understanding of the complexities of Kanji characters. As she brought over the wooden bowl of seafood to her husband, she peered down to see the boy's work and gasped - numbers! Small columns and tables were sprawled across the boy's sheets of paper as he used the pennies to count, with answers to simple problems scribbled in pencil lead beneath symbols of multiplication and division. She called over her husband, who in turn hurried over to examine the papers and observe his son.\n\nHe flicked through the papers; each creased sheet reading 'Science' or 'Mathematics', reading with basic problems or chemical formulas with diagrams printed onto them. The boy's father scratched his head and gazed down at him, smiling and clearly proud.

The question he posed was merely a way to understand Takagi's own reasoning.\n\n"Giving grant money to deserving scientists could greatly speed up the pace at which new technologies enter the market. The corporations are sure to then fund anything of value at that point, which will make said products more economically viable to the general population.\n\n"You have clearly thought this proposal through, sir. I think it sounds like a fine idea. However, you should carefully consider your options when it comes to handing out the grants. Our budget should not be wasted on dead-end research."\n\nWishing to attend to some intricate matter, Naksone excused himself with a polite bow. The Prime Minister was somewhat surprised that his suggestion had gone down so well.

He would side with Zenjiro, there would be some arguments, and ultimately they would forge a compromise so that Japan could continue to progress. This procedure had become so commonplace that they would sometimes skip straight to the compromise segment.\n\nTakagi took his seat, rubbed his eyes, and shuffled the weekly reports until he could see the recent news going about. But... something was off. The cabinet had been unusually silent as he was entering, rather than their typical rowdiness. Zenjiro was leaning forward, prepared to speak. Strange.

The work has started widespread albeit small protests, all of them fighting for Kato's largest and most ambitious goal, the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho, the National Eugenics Law, which has cemented eugenics, restriction of birth control access, and the sterilization of 'inferiors' as government policy since the 40s."

 japtakagirecon.38.d:0 "It was a park bridge, as regular as any other, but special for its distance from civilization. Once dusk arrived and all the park goers had long since left, a few dregs of the crowds came out from the woodworks and assembled underneath the bridge. Other groups, arriving in beat-up cars and the last buses of the night, joined their peers below the bridge. More and more came forward, springing outwards from the nearby slums and alleyways. Students. They spread red paint and ribbons between themselves, emulating the socialist revolutionaries and communist freedom fighters of yore. A few select firebrands dragged out soapboxes, park benches and lunch tables, prepared to extol the righteousness of their mission. Others lit alight barrels filled with brush, the chilly wind gnawing at their skin. One of the leaders of the students' unions, a proverbial veteran of the movement, got up to speak, and with him the mob silenced itself.\n\n"You all know what we're here to discuss. Kato. Now, I know some of you think this is our opportunity to spring forward, to make our presence known and get the government working for true progress. Yes, this is our moment, but I ask of you all, we must wait a little longer. This is a spark, but the flame has not yet been struck. Of course, this is injustice. The government is out there, murdering innocents in the name of 'racial hygiene' and preventing the oppressed from stopping their oppression. That said, a woman getting denied a political position isn't what we need, it isn't powerful enough. We want progress? Blood has to be shed. The moment blood runs in the gutters, and you know they'll take the first chance they can to kill a kid, we riot. You hear? We riot, and they'll have to listen!"\n\nThe mob began to slam their fists against their chests. With two fingers, they stroked red paint across their cheeks. Their eyes were an inferno, a whirlwind of rage and absolution. With the complexions of martyrs-to-be, they glanced at one another, wondering who would be the one to die at the hands of the system."

 japtakagirecon.39.d:0 "She marched forward, her face shoved into Kato's autobiography. She read over each and every word and phrase, becoming ever more infuriated at the thought of the injustice pervasive throughout Japan. She had never noticed, or perhaps she had never let herself see it. Now she remembered the awkward comments made by her mother whenever she stepped out of her bounds and what the government spewed from its outlets about the roles of girls and boys. Indoctrination was what it was. Looking up from the autobiography, she formed a wily smile. It didn't work. The years of propaganda had failed, because she was here, realizing that it was what it was, indoctrination.\n\nSuddenly, upon entering a suburban courtyard of her district, she couldn't feel her foot reach the ground. She glanced down, only to find the cold, hard concrete floor of the courtyard meeting her face. She could tell, even in her position, it was another goddamn pothole she had just tripped in. Kato's autobiography slipped from her fingers in the panic, and in its flight, the false cover she had been using to hide the book's identity flew from the autobiography's confines. The book slid away, far from her grasp. A local policeman, noticing what had happened, began to run over. Dizzily, she attempted to snatch Kato's autobiography, but she wasn't quick enough. The policeman, noticing the cover of the book, stopped his running.\n\nShe steadied herself, but upon looking back towards the policeman, all she could sense was pain and blunt force. A bone, she couldn't tell which, cracked, and with it blood sprayed onto the concrete. The policeman, wielding a wooden truncheon, again smashed his club into her forehead. She winced and grabbed at her eye. Through her fingers, a torrent of blood washed onto the floor. She attempted to cry, but the pain of doing so forced her to collapse onto the ground. He kept beating into the convulsing body of the woman until she lay mangled and bloodied in the center of the courtyard. A few passersby desperately attempted to hold him back, but to no avail. Most stayed at arm's length, content to stare instead of intervene. By the end, she was dragged away, handcuffs locked onto her disfigured wrists."

A woman being denied to a political position was a regular act of oppression, no different to the ones they all experienced day after day. The beating and mutilation of an innocent woman just for carrying around the wrong book was the limit of their patience, however. They kicked at the walls, preparing their feet for the real thing. Out of their backpacks and purses, they unfurled wooden clubs and antique guns. They were going to fight, if need be. A leader of the students' union marched onto a lunch table, and as they began to speak the mob silenced itself.\n\n"Let's get this over with. The government and police have transformed this spark into a flame. The police no longer enforce law and principle. Instead, they're all thugs. Criminals who march across our streets, beating and maiming anyone who threatens their hegemony. Where once they stopped wrongdoers and misfits, they have transformed into your local death squad! A terrorist organization the government has taught us to call 'law enforcement.' It is in this period of sorrow we must act. Get the government working for the greater good, I say! Tomorrow, a couple hours after schooling has ended, let us all congregate by the university's lecture hall. Once we get the chance, we take over and proclaim our message. Get this out to other universities, the times are going to change whether they want it to or not!"\n\nThe mob chanted to the tune of revolt. They raised their fists to their chests and foreheads.

 japtakagirecon.41.d:0 "They walked through the halls of Keio University, average students and scholars, born into a world of tradition without a notion of revolution or change. All of that had changed once a single word had stormed through their minds and ink, Kato. With Kato, they were at last able to see the injustice that surrounded them, and with knowledge, they could fight that injustice. This generation was not unified, however. Although all followed Kato, they varied from reformers to revolutionaries. One question lingered in the minds of those who wanted change: how do we make the government listen? Protests, riots, terror? No matter, things had to change somehow, and they would be the ones to bring it about. News was going around that universities across the nation were all staging incidents to force the government's hand. Keio was special, in that regard. Its students were those uplifted from the lower class, the next generation of parvenus. The student body itched at the trigger, prepared to take extreme action to bring about Kato's vision.\n\nThe bell rang, and so the students dragged out backpacks, purses and packages. What emerged was weaponry, make-shift batons and bludgeons, even the occasional pistol. They stormed the halls, breaking through into the general offices of the university. The teachers took their chance to evacuate, and in their absence the PA systems were left open for use in the student's mission. A grainy, blaring voice spread their message throughout the halls, classrooms and dormitories of the university. "Spread the word, the next generation has taken command of Keio University. Our demands are simple, and the living conditions we ask for are matched across the world. First, a repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho. We are not barbarians who freely murder our own citizens over their skills and abilities. Secondly, the government must answer for the beating and maiming of all those, across the nation, who have done nothing but read the works of Shidzue Kato. Kato's autobiography should be unbanned, and the government should rein in the police force. Such acts are crimes against morality. Lastly, the government should, as should have been done already, support the victims of the fallout of the economic crisis. The question remains, until our demands are fulfilled, who do you serve?""

The scattered papers in the streets, the glares and chants of the youth. A tension was building, he just had to land his fingers on the pulse of their animus. He could not remedy ills if he was ignorant of the facts. Zenjiro's foreboding message of a discontented youth had proven deadly accurate. If Zenjiro looked anxious or prepared to give a speech, Takagi would know something was up. As Takagi threw his briefcase onto the board room table, he searched for Zenjiro's face. After looking...\n\nWhere was he? Zenjiro was missing, but at least the rest of the cabinet had arrived, even Kido. Takagi could recognize when something was wrong, Zenjiro was not the type to miss his meetings.\n\nHe shot into the conversation, looking to break the aura of mystery surrounding the past month. "Where is Zenjiro? Look, just tell me what is going on. You are my cabinet, are you not? If something is wrong, why have I not heard of it?"\n\nKido looked about. The rest of the cabinet were sheepishly silent. Although he didn't want the task of reining in Takagi, he had become numb to the less enviable aspects of politicking. "Takagi, Zenjiro is missing because of the students. The youth have staged a series of purposeful 'incidents' across universities all throughout the nation. Most importantly, the students of Keio University have occupied the school grounds and are refusing to give up until their demands are met. A woman, Shidzue Kato, almost made it into the Diet, but upon failing she published her autobiography, which has inspired widespread protests, revolts even. They want the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho and a smattering of other demands. Zenjiro is attempting to defuse the situation, and it is my belief that we can still negotiate with the students."\n\nTakagi looked around the table. Nakasone, although keeping quiet, was clearly seething with rage. His elbows rested on the table, and his hands covered his mouth. Takagi could tell, Nakasone was begging for an end to this, a crackdown."

Out of the boredom of their duty a representative of the government arrived, loudspeaker in hand, collection of haphazardly scribbled-together notes in the other. He balanced himself on a police barricade, prepared to blare his message across Keio University.\n\n"Students of Keio University! The government of Sokichi Takagi is sympathetic to your cause!

He had gotten this far, and the students had agreed to step down if, and only if, the government took action concerning their core demand of repealing the Kokumin Yuseiho. Of course, this wasn't preferable, but at least they agreed to step down at all. Takagi summoned his cabinet for an emergency meeting, so that they could agree to what sort of action they should take. Nakasone would be adamantly opposed, that was-\n\n"Takagi, please. The whole point of this maneuver was bait and switch. They agree to step down in exchange for us taking action, and once they do step down, we intervene and put a silent end to these shenanigans. We were never meant to actually fulfill our end of the deal, we agreed to that. This was supposed to teach them a lesson without risk of harm, for fear of further backlash. We've accomplished what we've set out to do, there is no more discussion to be had. Arrest the students, put them up for the crimes they have committed in vandalizing and destroying Keio University's property, and move on. As I said earlier, we are not puppets of prepubescent mobs."\n\nUrgh. Nakasone was at it again. He couldn't accept a single gesture of good faith, any sign that we're not the corrupt backstabbers our youth sees us as. That's how Nakasone wins, compromising in a way such that he doesn't have to compromise. Perhaps- no. No more. We will demonstrate to our constituents our character and moral fiber. Besides, perhaps investigating the legitimacy of the Kokumin Yuseiho wouldn't be a bad idea?\n\n"Nakasone, it is already decided. A committee will be formed to investigate the constitutional legality of the Kokumin Yuseiho. If we are not to act, the youth will view us as backstabbers. Protests, and perhaps more revolts will arise across the nation. This is the least we can do. The only further discussion left for us to have is this: how shall we put this committee into practice?""

Takagi's piecemeal and unenthusiastic pace of social reform had not, it turned out, put an end to the youth movement's desire for progress. The Keio University Incident was what was on the headlines, a betrayal as it was painted. The students had only wanted a few reforms, most of all the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho, which continued to see through that supposed 'inferiors' were murdered or sterilized. Takagi's bandaid remedy to the deaths of innocents was not, in retrospect, a gentle way to approach the issue. Sure, a committee was formed to question the legality of the Kokumin Yuseiho, but it did nothing and continued to do nothing. Kato wrote a scathing op-ed in all mainstream newspapers, who were all too happy to accept the circulation of their papers for free. It was on everyone's minds: the youth movement was ever more enraged, and Takagi could not continue to prevent the march of social progress.\n\n"Sokichi Takagi claims to be the leader of the liberal faction of the Yokusankai, and yet his actions are painted with the colors of blind reaction and the blood of the honorable. Every day, a man, woman or child is forever more deprived of a future wherein they can birth life of their own, all due to a label of inferiority gifted to them by our government. Every day, thousands of infants, innocent souls just given consciousness, are forcefully deprived of their parents to be exterminated en masse in the fires of our government's bloodlust.

It was never meant to come to this; Takagi did not want anyone dead from these antics. Yet, people were dying. Not just those students, but every infant killed due to the Kokumin Yuseiho. Some would say Takagi was buying into the propaganda, but he couldn't ignore the reality of sterilization and extermination which pervaded the Japanese system. He was supposed to be a liberal, a reformer.

It was an unusual sort of anger for Takagi. He was never a furious or vindictive man. He took his anger out in controlled bursts of frustration, always in the form of pragmatic analyses turned attacks. He could be hostile, yes, but never openly enraged. This day would be different. This day, Takagi was explosive.\n\n"Nakasone. What have you done? There are students, children, dead on the floor of Keio University because of your actions, your propositions! Why... Why could we not have negotiated? Why did you have to suggest we crack down, we beat down children? You act like lives and people are nothing. I truly wonder, Nakasone. Why do you do what you do? Is there any reason you oppose a repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho? From the looks of it, you mindlessly put your faith in systems which are killing people. Killing people, Nakasone!

He was, too, a student with radical dreams once. He thought he could transform the navy from the inside into a liberalized, less militaristic organization. He had succeeded, but these children had not. Frustrated by an oppressive system, they rebelled. They lost, of course, in the most tragic of ways. Takagi shed a few tears as he looked over their cobblestone plaques. The fog and humid mist of the horizon was all that would welcome his sadness.\n\nA few camera flashes and forlorn questions thrown pitifully against his back greeted his return to the reality of Japan and its politics. Some straggler journalists had followed him here, so it seemed. Even in the abyss of the mind, he could not attain privacy. Takagi turned to the journalists, prepared to make an announcement.\n\n"To all of those who may be listening in, I would like to make a promise. The deaths of these students, dark though it may seem, were acts of martyrdom for a righteous cause, and I will see to it that their cause does not die before justice is done. This situation will be handled appropriately. It has been my resolve, ever since the beginning of my premiership, to see to it that the innocent and good-willed do not experience pain for nothing.

Takagi smirked, skeptical of Kato's sanity, and continued flicking through the article's claims. He came across phrases such as 'treasonous against the freedom of humanity' and 'a misogyny amplified to imperial standards', and chuckled harder at the outrageousness of their claims.\n\nAfter reading some of the terms to Kido, the Prime Minister found Kato's section on the recent student protests. She remained ambiguous over her support of the student protests, but noted that the more Takagi's police used violence, the more violent the students would grow. Takagi, lost for words, read this over many times. The students grew louder and louder each day, motivated by their resistance against law enforcement. He had already thought it, already seen it.

The mass gathering of protesters buzzed through the city, frothing at the mouth in search for anyone to hold accountable.\n\nTakagi sat with his cabinet in his office, the crowds only a few streets away. Law enforcement redirected the masses of people, but the Prime Minister knew they'd eventually reach his building. He tapped his finger repeatedly on his desk; his eyes fixated on the air in front of him as he thought about what to do. The room was sweating with a bothered worry, until Foreign Minister Kuranari Tadashi groaned and yelled, "We have to do something. These are radicals, Prime Minister! Who knows what they will do if we let their grubby hands near our legislature. Look outside - it's treason!"\n\nTakagi glanced at the irritated man before returning his vision to the thin air. He was still and silent, but sweating profusely. The faint roar of the protests grew louder and louder as the march continued, with law enforcement regrouping closer to the cabinet's office. Behind them, they had left destruction in their path, litter across the streets and windows smashed near outbreaks of violence. Clashes with law enforcement became more frequent, now visible from the windows of Takagi's offices. He peered from behind a curtain and turned back to his cabinet, all eager to hear his next move.

There is a growing possibility that failure to handle this matter will shift public opinion away from us.

Eventually, it was Koichi Kido who broke the uneasy silence.\n\n"A more careful and prolonged application of force will solve this.

If we meet them with force, they will only become more emboldened and radical. Let us attempt negotiations again. Once someone reminds of how reforms are actually made, they will give in."\n\nBefore any sort of argument between his two ministers could begin, Takagi held up a hand to quiet them.

We ask only to be included in matters that shape our future, that we feel strongly about. The government will have to put up with us until our demands are met!" The student was met with applause from his fellows.\n\n"Your concerns have been noted, but the decisions concerning your involvement have already been made. You must accept this." Horikiri seemed to only embolden the students further each time he refused their demands. Each voice in the crowd was received with great praise, while he was met with silence.

 japtakagirecon.54.d:0 "Takagi met with Kishi Nobusuke, a prominent MP in the National Diet, in a garden not too distant from the Prime Minister's estate. They strolled through the green gardens and caught up about personal affairs, approaching a wooden bench to sit and watch the birds while discussing various events across the globe. The two men nodded and agreed with one another on multiple issues and chuckled about others, usually pausing with a brief and awkward silence between each sentence.\n\nSuddenly, Kishi turned to the Prime Minister and gave him a stern look. "I know who you are talking to," he said, bluntly, "the student leaders. It's becoming more obvious." Takagi's eyes widened and his mouth went dry, but he did not let any sign of weakness show. He turned his head towards Kishi with a look of disapproval, pressuring him to apologize for his deceitful claims. Kishi, unbothered by the Prime Minister's appearance, smirked silently, before pulling a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his nose. He looked back towards the serene gardens for a moment, then uttered to Takagi: "Don't try to hide it from me," provoking the Prime Minister further.\n\n"Mr. Kishi, I hope you're not planning anything malevolent," remarked Takagi, prying for more information from his acquaintance.\n\nKishi replied after a moment, gazing into the garden's graceful fountains. "Mr. Prime Minister, what I think remains with me as a law-abiding citizen. All I say is to be careful what you bring up in the Diet; the protests are closely watched, but you are watched more so.""

It was late, and they had both stood in front of the great panel of glass, peering out over Tokyo's evening skyline through the trickles of raindrops smeared over the window. The rain pattered and tapped on the glass; it was a calming and musical experience that distracted Zenjiro from his recently far more stressful role. After clearing his throat, the Prime Minister began speaking to him, slowly and softly enough that the rain was still very much audible.\n\n"We can't let this keep happening. It will be chaos out there," Takagi paused, before speaking again, "You and I both know this ends one way... I want the Tokko at work tomorrow morning."\n\nZenjiro turned to Takagi with a disapproving scowl, protesting the Prime Minister's request. He insisted it was far beyond what was necessary for the students; it was inessential to be so draconian, yet all of his pleas were met with a solemn frown from Takagi. Zenjiro darted his head back to the window and was silent for a moment. He peered out over the city and at the great marvels the empire had built in the last fifty years. He gulped, knowing the Prime Minister was right to combat the protests, and began to speak slowly to Takagi, "And... what do you want to be done?"\n\nThe Prime Minister, now a few feet away and sitting behind his desk, began to list operations and times for meetings to coordinate the use of the Tokko with the rest of his cabinet. Zenjiro, knowing what was right, agreed and then bowed before leaving the Prime Minister's office. Takagi fell into his chair and rested his eyes, continuing to listen to the rain tapping on the glass."

We may appear as students, some of us barely even of drinking-age, but it is our generation of disaffected youth that suffers at the hands of those who lived before us. Who can say those who sit in power know what's best for us? Did they not get their empire? What does Takagi know about childhood today, or-or what it's like to have a child - nothing! We have been in the streets for a while now, calling for change - and change we shall get! We are loud, and we will have to be louder for the Prime Minister to hear us.

I'm sure you are all aware of the secret meetings Sato is leading under the code name 'Oboke Yui', and I am here to relay to you the next: in three days, not far from the Keio University libraries.

Carrying a slim briefcase, Takagi turned back and greeted the two men with a confused frown, shaking their hands firmly. Usually, these men would heckle and jeer at his government in the chamber, harassing his legislative attempts with all kinds of vetoes and ideological opposition. It confused the Prime Minister to see his adversaries greet him so familiarly.\n\nKishi and Ikeda grinned throughout the entire interaction with a smug aura about them, chuckling and smirking with the Prime Minister. They congratulated him for his 'bravery' to 'deal with' the students with appropriate law enforcement and security measures. "Brave, a man such as yourself fighting back," Ikeda snickered, wiping his nose as he gagged on his own laughs. The Prime Minister was unimpressed, keeping a straight face. In what felt like a backhanded compliment, Kishi noted he especially admired the retaliation of riot police fighting back at radicals in the crowd, possibly alluring and humoring Takagi's pacifism relative to their dexterity to call for repression.\n\nTakagi shook their hands once more, thanking them for their presence, and left to return to his estate, unsure of the true intentions of the interaction. As Takagi stepped into his car and the chauffeur closed the door behind him, Kishi and Ikeda waved at him from the steps of the Diet. The smug grins smeared across their faces revolted the Prime Minister, now trying to distract himself by fiddling with the locks on his briefcase."

 japtakagirecon.58.d:0 "The cabinet sat in a boardroom and passed about leaflets containing excerpts from the student manifestos currently circulating around areas afflicted with protests. The cheap yellow lightbulb that hung above the men buzzed as they flicked through the colorful flyers. The hum drilled into their minds, driving them insane under the mounting pressure of civil unrest in the streets of Japan. Takagi dashed some of the flyers in front of him and fell back in his chair, rocking forward and back in an attempt to keep himself calm.\n\nKido, sifting through sheets and sheets of paper, took off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. He cleared his throat, and spoke to the Prime Minister: "They're all saying the same thing. They want incomprehensible and revolutionary change." A deafening silence followed, only broken by the sound of creasing paper and the occasional sigh of a minister. Nakasone, with tired eyes and sweat clinging to the inside of his suit, groaned to Takagi, noting that their demands were outrageous and could never be satisfied. Takagi raised his brow, acknowledging the irrationality of the radicals put things in his favor, but he was not comforted to be in such a precarious position.\n\nThe cabinet stayed in the boardroom into the late hours of the night, eventually stripping down their overcoats and blazers to work with rolled-up sleeves and loosened ties. As the clock struck two in the morning, they had come to a consensus. The men gazed at the piles and piles of pages they had gone through and noted the core ofwhat the protesters demanded - fix the economy and repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. Takagi, dwarfed by the sheer amount of material, stood back in awe and understood that either the crisis must be dealt with soon, or else he would be."

 japtakagirecon.59.t:0 "A Spanner In The Works"
 japtakagirecon.59.d:0 "The cabinet had gathered at the Prime Minister's estate for drinks in the afternoon, taking a break from official appearances but still hard at work discussing policy as a unit. Nakasone, with somewhat of a spring in his step, poured glasses of water for the Prime Minister and the others to cool them down, listening to tunes on the radio. As he merrily approached Zunjiro, the security minister scowled and muttered: "What makes you so bloody zany?", dimming Nakasone's mood and reducing him to a quiet shell of his cheerful self.\n\nKido, sprawled out on a leather chair, sat back and engaged with Takagi in discussing any possible outcome of future efforts to legislate and ignore the agenda of the protesters. The Prime Minister chuckled, cynical of the Diet's attention to detail, and shook his head. Kido nodded, understanding of Takagi's pains and began to involve Nakasone and Tadashi in the discussions between the five of them. Soon after, a buzz disrupted the music on the radio, and Nakasone dragged himself from his seat to turn it off.\n\nAt the very last moment, Takagi whipped his head around and demanded Nakasone turn the volume up. The five sat there and listened, not quite knowing what to expect, and all of them leapt from their positions upon hearing the news - a huge protest with thousands of attendees had gathered in the Tokyo suburbs, sounding more radical than before. The Prime Minister's eyes widened as he looked back to Kido, and Nakasone's head fell into his hands. Calling for Zenjiro to get a hold of the head of Tokyo's law enforcement, a cold sweat climbed up Takagi's back as his face grew red with worry."

 japtakagirecon.60.t:0 "For The Sake Of National Security"
 japtakagirecon.60.d:0 "The Prime Minister sat in his estate with Kido and Zenjiro, eating lavish dishes of fresh fish and vegetables. They sat at a fine-clothed table surrounded by two servants who repeatedly refilled Kido's glass with wine, and occasionally went off to return with more extravagant meals for the men. Takagi was starving, and any food would be good enough to get him thinking straight again. The three made the occasional comment about their lunch as they chewed through the expensive delicacies, until Takagi began to make a point of his position as Prime Minister.\n\nKido and Zenjiro listened diligently to Takagi, who sat explaining his dilemmas to the two whilst eating his sea urchin and fresh salmon. He debated about putting an end to the protests once and for all, much to Zenjiro's surprise, and asked if suppression would drown out the radical cries. Talking of police raids and mass arrests, the Prime Minister risked jeopardizing his entire support base in his impassioned ramblings. Zenjiro stopped eating and listened very carefully to him, momentarily glancing over at Kido who was lost for words at the sheer nature of Takagi's argument.\n\nAfter taking a sip of water, Takagi then continued to contemplate - now wondering if he should simply invite Kato over for an honest discussion. The Prime Minister looked towards Kido whilst rambling, and Zenjiro attempted to hold back a snicker. Kido kicked him from under the table, and continued to pay attention to a reflecting Takagi. He nodded and returned one-word replies to the Prime Minister, attempting to hide his hesitance under a blanket of cool approval. Takagi then leaned back in his chair, signalling for another glass of water, and pondered for a while - what would be the right choice? Perhaps more importantly, how would he want to be remembered?"

You are a politician, and you've lived and worked in the heart of politics in Japan for longer than I have. It seems that I am being dragged into that heart more and more these days. I am sure you have seen and heard much of the student movement that has taken the streets these past few months. I am so very happy to see young people here stand up for themselves and fight back. Such a movement for genuine reform has been long coming in this country. I cannot say I agree with all their demands, but I suppose I am somewhat older than them! I hope this does not undermine their hard work, as I fear the older generations will not be so radical as they are... My public support for these students has had some unexpected consequences. It seems that I have ended up becoming some of a figurehead for this movement, despite my hesitations. While it has been good to provide them with this support, I must say the attention from the political establishment is becoming uncomfortable.\n\nThe Prime Minister has recently expressed interest in meeting with me and I am deeply unsure as to what I must do. He speaks of negotiation and compromise, but I wonder if that is truly what he, or those he represents wants. Agreeing to meet with him, even if it does illicit a workable compromise, might push me further into the limelight. I don't want to suffer through another arrest like I did all those years ago.\n\nAs you can see, I need your aid. You know how to deal with politicians and bureaucrats, you've stood against the YSK for years and called for reforms all the while. What do you do in situations like this? I hope you are well and that this letter does not cause you too much bother\n\nMy Deepest Thanks,\n\nShidzue."

 japtakagirecon.62.t:0 "On Youth Activism And Reproductive Rights"
 japtakagirecon.62.d:0 "It has been over thirty years since the implementation of the now deeply controversial Kukumin Yuseiho. Since then, it has been used to suppress the rights of women, while masking itself in a guise of protecting the population from genetic disease. Failure on the part of the government to address this long-standing issue has caused numerous problems over the decades. While Prime Minister Takagi has recently opened a commission to "re-examine" the kokumin yuseiho, it is doubtful that much will change through this process. What is clear, is that the youth of this country are no longer willing to sit by and allow their future to be decided by the older generations. Can we really blame them for protesting the government's sluggish response to the changing times? I do not think so. When a piece of legislation affects around half the population's rights to their own bodies, is it truly so unreasonable that many young people in Japan today wish to see the kokumin Yuseiho go?\n\nIt is narrow-minded to view the student protests as merely a spark of rebelliousness. I believe they demonstrate the will and demands of a much larger section of the population that has been too suppressed, both politically and socially, to speak up prior to now. These are laws that affect the fundamental rights of women and they stand in the face of progress and equality. The activism of the youth in the face of government stubbornness should be seen as an inspiration and a bright hope of future reforms towards a more equal society. The Kokumin Yuseiho must now be repealed and replaced with something more fitting with the times we live in. It is my hope that the student's hard work can demonstrate this to the government."

 japtakagirecon.63.d:0 "Some time had passed since Prime Minister Takagi had reached out to Kato Shidzue. Despite being ever so clear to present this as an opportunity for compromise and progress, it now appeared that she most likely had other plans. However, her silence had in fact given Takagi more time to think about his position. Had too much time passed at this point for the negotiations to prove fruitful? Was meeting with Kato too great of a risk? Fortunately for Takagi, a new solution presented itself firstly through a knock on the door.\n\nHaving been told to come in, it was Kido Koichi who entered the office.\n\n"Prime Minister, I understand that Kato has not been in contact with you?"\n\n"That is correct. Do you have some sort of suggestion for me?\n\n"That is exactly what I have for you, sir. I believe it would be wiser that someone visit Kato in your stead, possibly myself or Horikiri. It would be a private meeting, one that you can dictate the terms of without having to be in attendance yourself.\n\nIt did not take long for the Prime Minister to see the wisdom of this, which he signified to his deputy with a nod.\n\n"Then I would suggest you inform Kato of this change of plan immediately. Enough time has been wasted and I dread to think what could happen if Nakasone or Kishi were to speak to her first."\n\nKido bowed and departed to make the necessary calls for the meeting. The Prime Minister felt grateful for his deputy's quick thinking, although he wished he had spoken to him about the matter sooner."

 japtakagirecon.64.d:0 "Entering the small, wallpapered room with a clipboard in his hand, the finely-dressed Kido made his way over to sit across the wooden table from Kato Shidzue. He extended his arm out to greet her, to which she bowed her head and looked away. Kido, foreseeing the awkward tension of the meeting, took a deep breath and began to get comfortable.\n\nHe wiggled in his chair momentarily, before resting his arms on the table and speaking to Kato: "I knew Ishimoto Keikichi. A good man; he really stood up for what he believed in. Saying that, we could never agree.. He would always be adamant in bringing up issues no one else cared about. I respect his firm loyalty to such a cause. He must've been a hell of a husba-"\n\n"Do you respect my firm loyalty to a cause, Mr. Kido? Are we not here to discuss matters far more important than private affairs?"\n\nKido sat in awe, stunned by Kato's interruption. She was a difficult and unwieldy force to be reckoned with, he noted, and could not help but be intrigued by her passions for such an absurd cause. Nonetheless, he had a duty to piece together what she stood for, and understand her role in the recent chaos spreading throughout Japan's cities. Putting the clipboard to the side and crossing one leg over the other, Kido began to question Kato on her political positions and theory. He was seized by her theses, creating great mental notes on her postulations over the state of modern Japan. Kido nodded and smiled - he couldn't get enough of her bullshit."

 japtakagirecon.65.t:0 "The Negotiations Begin"
 japtakagirecon.65.d:0 ""Haven't I already made it simple, Mr. Kido? A total abolition of the Kokumin Yuseiho. It is an insult and affront to the equality of the sexes and the respect of the nation."\n\nKato sat across from Kido, quite pleased with herself. She was firm and her position was immovable; she held her chin up and looked down upon the pampered Mr. Kido. They had been discussing her feminist theory for over an hour now, and Kido listened casually whilst scribbling notes. He sat across from her and watched from behind his clipboard, recording key pieces of information to be passed on in a later report, though at moments he found himself doodling during her over-scrupulous ranting.\n\nEventually, she had finished speaking and Kido saw his chance; referring to his notes, he glanced back up at her and prodded her with loaded questions: \n"I appreciate your passion, Miss Kato. I do ask, if I may, what grand solution to wipe away the 'Patriarchal Dictatorship' would repealing a single law be? Do you speak out for a second about the sterilisation clause? For a woman of modern academia, you have left a lot unclear."\n\nKido had a despicably smug look across his face. He had caught Kato out, and she was red-faced and furious. The meeting ended inconclusively, and although Kido left with his ego thoroughly stroked, none could claim victory over the other."

 japtakagirecon.66.t:0 "The White Queen's Revelation"
 japtakagirecon.66.d:0 "Kido had arranged to meet Kato again over tea, where they shared a pleasant interaction in the gardens of The Kantei. The two conversed whilst listening to birdsong and the breeze brushing through the Japanese maple leaves. Gradually, Kido prodded Kato to ask about her stance on the sterilization clause of the Kokumin Yuseiho, to which she cleared her throat and blinked a few times in astonishment. Kido chuckled, insisting he was curious as she did not relieve him with an answer in their last interaction. Comforted by the tranquil and serene environment, she began to disclose her thoughts to the well-dressed and cunning Mr. Kido:\n\n"In truth, my opinion... well I have no opinion. I have no problem with the sterilization clause. I have not come into any friction with it, and I don't understand how anyone would, frankly."\n\nKido's eyes lit up like stars as he nodded, maintaining his facade of genuine interest to keep her talking. Nudging his fingers across the underside of the table to check the bugging device was still recording, Kido broke into a firm smile that seemed to approve of Kato's stance. She explained herself, and every word he treated as a gift. She mentioned, somewhat reluctantly, that if the student's found out about this opinion she would be treated as an outcast and as an enemy. Kido's smile spread across his face, delighted her confessions were being recorded on tape, and his amiable expressions urged her to divulge further. He could barely contain his glee; this was all the evidence Kido needed, and he was already thinking of ways to blackmail her as he gazed into her eyes."

Indeed, as he presented the bounties of information to Takagi, the Prime Minister let out a genuine smile that stuck from cheek to cheek throughout the entire meeting. Kido, briefing Takagi with any and all information he needed to know about Kato, spoke for a long while, dashing between anecdotes and figures to help him make sense of the operation.\n\nTagaki stood up from his seat, still listening to Kido, and reached for a couple of luxury, expansive glasses from behind a cabinet. He poured a small amount of his finest champagne for himself and his colleague as Kido began to announce his news of the tapes. Thoroughly impressed, Takagi could not be more happy with the lengths Kido had gone to to gather the evidence required to keep Kato under his finger. They raised their glasses, and sipped from the wine with a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe Prime Minister fell back into his chair and exhaled a sigh of relief. Nodding his head in approval, he noted to Kido that he thought Kato was an idiot, but a useful one that had potential to be the unraveling of the student movement. With a sense of achievement, both Takagi and Kido took another sip of the champagne and sat back in their chairs, taking in this moment of personal victory."

 japtakagirecon.68.d:0 "As Takagi's Deputy, Kido worked particularly hard with making sure the nobility remained supportive towards the Prime Minister. However, Takagi's recent policy pushes would require all of Kido's connections and guile to successfully sell it to the Kazoku. The Deputy Prime Minister's task would be to convince some of the more conservative nobility of supporting Takagi. While he had no chance of winning them all over, there were some that could be convinced through flattery and conversation. As such, Kido had gathered his chosen candidates for lunch.\n\n"Esteemed gentlemen, I am honored that you have all accepted my invitation to lunch."\n\n"We could hardly refuse when you take us to lunch here, Kido." This comment was met with polite chuckles from Kido and the rest of the nobles around the table. "I hope whatever business you wish to discuss will not ruin this meal. I do understand it has something to do with that dreadful woman Kato, yes?\n\n"I am afraid so gentlemen. Yet, I do ask that you hear me out, The Prime Minister has agreed to implement some of Kato's reforms and he requires your support to succeed. I understand that you are far from keen to see Kato get her way, but this a matter of saving the nation from disaster in the long-term. These small reforms will pacify the student protests and restore order to the streets. Besides, most of the changes will go unnoticed by most people. They are mostly symbolic gestures that will ultimately protect national polity"\n\nIt would have been incorrect to describe the assembled Kazoku as convinced. Kido could tell that he had not entirely won them over, but planted the seeds of consideration in heads. Stressing the issue would not do any good..\n\n"I do not need to hear a yes or no right now, gentlemen. Please consider what I said in your own time. Now, let us enjoy the rest of this luncheon." Forcing the nobility to act was unwise. It was better to give them the idea that they were making the decisions."

 japtakagirecon.69.d:0 "It had been some time since Ishimoto Keikichi had seen Kato in person. While they had remained fairly amicable over the years since the divorce, they usually spoke over the phone or through letters. This time however, Kato had been adamant about meeting him in person. Ishimoto felt it was best not to refuse and therefore invited her to meet him at this office in the Imperial Diet building. Kato was slightly surprised to see Ishimoto eating his lunch when she arrived.\n\n"This was the only time in my schedule that was open. Hopefully you don't need too much time to say what you need to"\n\n"I'm going to need a favor. I won't lie, it's quite a big ask, but I need you to do this."\n\nThe old politician sighed before finishing the food on his plate. "Go on then, you might as well tell me what you want."\n\n"As you know, the Prime Minister and I have come to an agreement regarding reforms to the kokumin yuseiho. He is planning to move forward with these reforms and put them to a vote in the Imperial Diet. However, it's not clear how much support Takagi has for this. That's why I need your help."\n\n"I think I see what you want. You want me to whip up independent support for the Prime Minister, correct?"\n\nKato gave a simple nod as a reply.\n\n"Do you really think this is worth it? Some piecemeal reform to get the youth off the government's back for a few years?"\n\n"I need you to understand that this is probably the best shot we have of implementing some genuine reform. When was the last time we had a chance like this to make things better for so many people?. At times like this, you're going to have to put away your distaste for the Prime Minister to achieve something good.\n\nIshimoto remained silent for a good few seconds, but expression changed to that of reluctant acceptance. "Fine, I'll see what strings I can pull for you. You're going to need a lot of help to pull this off.""

The opposition sat with eager looks on their faces, keen to hear Kishi speak. Those who were yet undecided on the matter of the Kokumin Yuseiho were also keen to hear the reform bureaucrat speak; perhaps he could help them make up their minds. The Prime Minister and his supporters were less than enthused. Finally, Kishi stood up from his seat among the rows of representatives.\n\n"From its inception, I have been an opponent of this government. The ideological direction of the Prime Minister has swayed Japan off course and led us down into a shameful state. I had expected as much from this government, but I had not expected them to now stoop even lower. In the face of protesting students, the Prime Minister has bowed his head in defeat!"\n\nKishi paused to allow his fellow reform bureaucrats to laugh for a few moments, keeping a close eye on Takagi's facial expression.\n\n"As for what the Prime Minister is offering these students in the hopes of appeasing them, it is nothing short of the gradual destruction of our society. This government will surrender the moral fabric of the nation under the guise of being diplomats and populists. Talks of reforming laws such as the Kokumin Yuseiho violate the Kokutai itself! This, of course, begs the question of how far this government is prepared to tear Japan apart. Will the Kokutai soon be examined by a commission? Will the Taisei Yokusankai be forcefully disbanded? I dread to think what will happen if the Prime Minister is not stopped. Those men in this room who still have your dignity, your morals and your conscience, I ask of you to vote against any proposed reform to the Kokumin Yuseiho. The very future of the nation is otherwise at risk."\n\nKishi was met with great applause by his fellows as he sat down.

He was a conservative, and he stood against such sweeping reform. However, with such a precarious and uncertain political climate, Ikeda relied on stability, even if it came from this Prime Minister. After what felt like hours of tense reasoning, Takagi felt like Ikeda was on a knife's edge; with a bit of bartering, he could be convinced. The old man was wary of even mentioning any attempt to repeal the Konoe-era law, and sighed out of frustration - despite everything, Takagi's plan was the safest option for the stability of the nation.\n\n"It's hardly religion, Ikeda. It's our last chance - there's no saying the Taisei Yokusankai will survive if we don't pass this through. The old law will go, but a new one will fall in its place. You have my word, the protections will stay in place."\n\nIkeda slowly shut his eyes. He bit his lip and slowly nodded, his hands sinking to his sides as he visibly began to concede to the Prime Minister. Takagi approached him with a smile and patted him on the back, thanking him for his support. Ikeda shook his head and made a point, noting that his support will disappear the moment legislation deviates from this promised path. Takagi, assuring Ikeda, grabbed his hand and shook it firmly.

Starting early in the morning, they had all spent their day trying to gather every last scrap of support or influence they could collectively muster. Before they began their meeting, they had all taken a moment to breathe. When Kido and Horikiri had entered the office they too were quite clearly out of breath. The three men sat around the Prime Minister's table, and Takagi began by explaining what he had managed throughout the day.\n\nThe Prime Minister had focused on his connections among the navy, hoping to limit their involvement in the matter or even get them to support him. Takagi had also worked to shore up the liberal clique in the diet, to ensure that none of them had any sudden ideas about how to vote. While the Prime Minister was not calling upon the largest pool of support, he was undeniably bringing in old allies that had always been fairly reliable. Takagi was therefore grateful for Horikiri and Kido, who had contacts of their own to call upon.\n\nAs expected, Deputy Prime Minister Kido had contacted numerous members of the House of Peers as well as a few officials in the Imperial Household. Meanwhile, Horikiri had spent his time hunting down potential allies in the House of Representatives.\n\nAll of this they told the Prime Minister, who, while clearly listening, was locked in deep consideration. Before ending the meeting for the night, Takagi summarized his feelings on the matter.\n\n"Even with all the allies we have gathered, the favors we have called in, and whatever other methods we have deployed, it is not yet clear whether we can be sure of victory. This is the beginning of the job, and I do not suspect it will be much easier to finish. We have stabilized our foundations, but now we must build a highrise.""

I would like to declare this government's efforts to approach the final repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho."\n\nTakagi paused in his speech, gazing into the sea of bobbing heads that watched him from the chamber's floor. He had spoken for almost twenty minutes, describing his new policy drive to the National Diet. His elucidations were clothed in a unique pragmatism; he was aware of the traditions and duties he had to uphold as Prime Minister but also conscious of the increasingly popular demands of the students who stood to protest in the streets again. Takagi stood tall and firm, yet his words sailed over the heads of many sitting in the hall.\n\nIt became more and more obvious towards the conclusion of the Prime Minister's speech that the Diet was split. Independents and Kidoites nodded and applauded the motions of Prime Minister Takagi, hailing him as a wise and pragmatic mediator. The same could not be said for the Reform Bureaucrats and many of the conservatives that filled the Diet's seats, as they shook their heads and audibly protested the speech with low groans and mumbles. An empty applause sounded throughout the great hall. From his podium, even with the supportive grins of allies in the Diet, it was clear that many would not even consider supporting him after voicing his intention to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. The Prime Minister let out a tired sigh, bowing his head from behind the platform, and retreated back to his seat as the session continued."

 japtakagirecon.74.d:0 "Takagi met with Kato in the gardens, finally face-to-face with the woman he had a deep and personal hatred for. Now she was on his own estate, and Takagi stood feet away from her as she fiddled with papers sprawled out on the table.\n\nThe Prime Minister had been discussing matters with her for a long while now, and they finally came to the topic of the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho. Takagi was beyond arguing with her as they had for months now, and simply snapped at her that the Diet was not cooperating with any attempt to revoke the law. He spoke down to her, scowling that the necessity to appeal to conservatives and independents in the Taisei Yokusankai was their only hope to gain a majority. It was daunting to the Prime Minister; he found himself at a stand-still - how could he convince moderates and conservatives to vote in favor of such a radical and liberal action?\n\nKato, turning to the Prime Minister after a brief moment, suddenly proposed a counter offer as Tagaki pinched the bridge of his nose in an exhausted and defeated frustration. She mentioned, to appease those who oppose the repeal, he could introduce legal protections expanding state welfare, childcare, and even legalizing abortion. Takagi looked up from his enraged despair, and with a confused smile he wagged his finger at her smug face. He refused to show his excitement; he wouldn't give her the satisfaction of being right. As he quietly signaled a servant to get on the phone to Kido, Kato smiled and began to listen to the birdsong of the gardens, finding peace in the Prime Minister's non-verbal gratification."

 japtakagirecon.75.d:0 ""Prime Minister, where are you going with all of this?"\n\nIn what was supposed to be a private conversation, Ikeda and Takagi argued in a boardroom in the National Diet building and the two men accused each other of all kinds of political malpractice. After a particularly heated moment, Takagi rubbed his brow and asked for Ikeda's honest opinion of the move to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. Ikeda inhaled a large breath, and then relented, mentioning he was personally apathetic. What mattered, he insisted, was that the government had a system in place to defend the traditional morality of the nation. National Eugenics Law or not, Ikeda confessed, many conservatives would support a respectful homage to the traditions of the empire in the budget and government policy proposals.\n\nTakagi was silent, staring at the man in confusion. Surely it was not that easy, he thought, in denial of the whole affair. The Prime Minister, now at relative ease compared to the anger of the earlier argument, could not hide his astonishment; he had the information he needed to get the conservatives behind a replacement bill. He still had to wrestle with the legislature, but understanding the Ikeda's platform on abortion and other issues gave him information key to drawing up a potentially successful bill in the National Diet. The question was, how much should he give them?"

They all hurried out of the room except for Nakasone, who spent some time wiping the lint off of his overcoat. Takagi stopped him once Kido had shuffled out of the door, and asked the minister about his family and personal life. After a short but amiable exchange of conversation, Takagi brought up the recent movements to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho.\n\n"To be totally honest, sir, I support the repeal. It's a better alternative to overbearing state power. It's not perfect, but all things considered I think it's the best way forward." Nakasone nodded, and spoke frankly to the Prime Minister after affirming his loyalties. Takagi, pleased to hear this, stood upright and proud to shake Nakasone's hand. In a political scene where rivals critiqued him from all sides, the Prime Minister was pleased to know that his ministers shared the same opinion as he did. He knew this was expected of his own government, but was grateful nonetheless that he could find at least some peace being surrounded by his closest aides and colleagues."

 japtakagirecon.77.d:0 "Takagi had returned to the National Diet to discuss greater efforts to legislate and cover the mess caused by recent social upheaval. The 'Eugenics Protection Law', his government penned it; a bill drafted to be debated in the Diet and approved by the legislature, receiving royal assent as soon as possible to sap at the magnitude of the ongoing nagging protests.\n\nOutlining its provisions, the Prime Minister had danced between his intentions with the law, finally mentioning its specific amendments to the status quo - the legalization of abortion as a medical procedure outside of necessity and the continuation of the practice of sterilization in medical facilities. The air in the chamber suddenly grew thick and tense as Takagi began to sweat beneath his suit. He could feel the disapproving gaze from traditionalists in the Diet prickling his skin.\n\nHailing the potential of the legal reorganization to bring positive social reform to Japanese society, the Prime Minister continued his speech with a calm and cool composure, hiding his panic from political rivals. As he began to finalize the final clauses of his bill, Takagi's irritated eyes drifted over to the seats on the right of the chamber; dozens of conservatives had collected their belongings and attempted to leave mid-session, clearly outraged at what the Prime Minister had presented to them. The speaker called them back, but to no avail. Feeling powerless, Takagi stood behind his podium and stared into the thin air, tired of facing constant friction in his efforts to solve the empire's troubles."

He cleared his throat, and peered across the chamber, brushing the room with his stern gaze - determined to pass this bill he had fought so intensely for. Takagi began to speak to the Diet, reading from a prepared speech, and maintained a calm and controlled decorum to distinguish his own authority over the diverging interests tearing the Taisei Yokusankai to pieces.\n\nComplete with all amendments, such as tightened restrictions on the period of pregnancy termination and a government-approved gynecological code of ethics, the bill had been taken apart and pieced back together many times over to find approval from the conservatives in the House of Peers. Takagi waved the bill, priding it for its comprehensive covering of modern attitudes towards women's health, whilst acknowledging a respectful relationship it had with traditional morality seen as virtuous across the nation. Despite this, however, the amendments did not inoculate the Prime Minister from scrutiny, and scowls from conservative factions of the Taisei Yokusankai were frequent as he gazed into the crowds of men scoffing at his works.\n\nThe Prime Minister finished his speech and sat down in the lukewarm tumble of applause that sounded from the Diet floor. He rested his breath and checked his pulse, calming himself down to remain still as the speaker began to gesture a vote."

She rushed to the bathroom, the dissolved remains of her dinner and lunch ending up in her toilet. She reached for the toilet paper, ripping off a piece to wipe her mouth. Her breathing was labored; her mouth and throat were thoroughly dried out. She rested, face lying on the rim of the toilet. It was not until a faint light shone through the window that she stood up, ever so cautiously. She looked at the mess in her toilet wondering how long this cycle of getting up to vomit and then going back to bed had gone on.\n\nShe flushed it away. Maybe she could ask her boyfriend what was going on? He was in the medical department, after all. Surely he'd know something.\n\nRolling her lover's number on her phone, she wondered all of the possibilities of what was going on with her. The thought struck her suddenly - 'What if you were pregnant?' As she listened to the ringing tone, Keiko stared into the distance, a stark realization sinking into every part of her being. Ignoring the voice greeting her, she looked down and realized what happened; they had been unprotected when they did 'that'.\n\nKeiko spoke into the phone: "I think I'm pregnant.""

She heard the door creak slightly, looking up from her lap to see a woman in scrubs with a folder in hand.\n\n"As to be expected, you're pregnant." The nurse read off of the file, looking at Keiko afterwards. "With your situation, I would get an abortion."\n\n"Are there any alternatives?" Keiko asked. "I don't want an abortion on my record."\n\nThe nurse's face softened. Internally, Keiko screamed, 'I don't want your pity!'. Externally, she remained neutral.\n\n"No. There aren't any alternatives other than keeping the child."\n\nShit. She was stuck between two options she didn't want. There's too much risk in keeping the fetus -- it would send her studies down the drain, not to mention the sheer cost involved. On the other, having an abortion was risky. What would her mother say? She saw the commercials; they convinced her it was abhorrent. But maybe it was the better thing to do. She couldn't sacrifice years of school now. She couldn't afford it.\n\n"Fine. I'll do it."\n\n"Follow me, then." The nurse began to walk to the hallway, with Keiko following."

She wondered how she could explain her choice to Takako -- she had told Keiko to remain celibate when she first entered university, after all.\n\n"Keiko, what's the matter with you?" Takako had placed her chopsticks on the napkin, looking straight at Keiko. In a flash, she was sitting up straight, picking up noodles and slurping them up.\n\n"What do you mean?" Keiko sipped some broth.\n\n"I've noticed that you've been looking - how do I say it - agitated? Out of it is a better term." Takako shifted a little, with her hands acting like they too showed concern for her.\n\n"It's nothing. The-" Keiko paused, thinking of a minor enough excuse that Takako would consider passable. "The weather has been extremely cold, as of late. It's nothing to be worried about."\n\n"If you want, we can go shopping for a nice coat." Takako offered, picking up the chopsticks once more. Keiko sighed in relief, before digging into her noodles. She hoped no incidents like this would happen in the future. At least until she had a good enough explanation as to why she did what she did."

Anything for her daughter.\n\nNow, Takako waited outside of Keiko's dormitory, buzzing into the building. She smiled, now that she was out of the cold. If Keiko was right about one thing, it was that the weather was enough to make someone get in a bad mood. She silently thanked Keiko's roommate, bowing slightly, before knocking on her door.\n\n"Coming!" Takako could hear Keiko rushing to the door, looking disheveled. She had probably just woken up.\n\n"Good morning, Keiko. Can I come in?" Takako asked, slightly raising her eyebrows. Keiko silently let her through, leaving shortly thereafter to go to the bathroom. This gave Takako time to look around her room, maybe see what she was up to. She noticed the yellow medical booklet on her desk. Did she have a doctor's appointment recently? It wouldn't hurt to check, right?\n\nIt started out well: Takako had flipped through the booklet, page by page, reminiscing on fond memories of when Keiko was but a tiny child. As she made her way to the last pages, she began to focus on her doctor's appointments. Maybe she had health problems? She turned to the second-to-last page, reading the information. Her eyes bulged out, processing the information laid bare before her. Her daughter had an abortion?\n\nIn her horror, Takako didn't notice Keiko's footsteps. A voice rang out: "I can explain.""

Nakasone folded his arms and scratched his chin, then pointed at the Prime Minister with an accusing scowl, demanding an explanation.\n\n"I just can't fathom why you would think this would be a good idea, Takagi. Have you not seen our budget? We are already squeezing the coffers dry as we speak. We cannot afford this!"\n\nThe Prime Minister, bubbling with anger, began to inhale deeper breaths, attempting to repress his rage at Nakasone's arrogance. How dare he tell the Prime Minister what or what not to do!\n\n"Do you know who you are talking to?", Takagi paused, before continuing with a firm and bold tone, "Have you forgotten your place in this cabinet? You are subordinate to me."\n\n"Sir, this is a matter of-"\n\n"Perhaps if you didn't stick your slimy fingers into every plan we had to fix this economy, we would be in a better place," Takagi uttered, remaining cool but with an assertive tone.\n\nThe Prime Minister's piercing eyes gazed at Nakasone, practically melting him with the intensity of his stare. Adamant to prove himself, the minister attempted to coordinate himself and question Takagi further, but could not gather his words under the pressure of Takagi's disapproving glare.

Time and time again they proudly voted against his reforms, with smug looks on their faces, and now the Prime Minister was here to convince them otherwise.\n\n"Prime Minister, we are simply not convinced your legislative proposals are appropriate in bringing 'reform' to the empire. We cannot stand for your misappropriation of our nation's traditions and customs. Some would call it an outrage!"\n\n"Mr. Miki, what respect do you have for integrity and custom when you attack this government by voting down our every effort to improve this nation? Where is the honor when you vote down bills that could help us fight poverty and corruption? Our government can and will work with you if you would only let us; this is a matter of supporting the empire in times of, frankly, great instability."\n\nTakagi extended his hand towards the two men, explaining further that he wished to have their support in the Diet to defend the empire from civil unrest. Ikeda and Miki appeared embarrassed as Takagi had cornered them, caging their loyalty with their own credences. The Prime Minister grinned as they both shook his hand after a long pause - the bargain had worked, and the conservatives had given in to the pressure."

They chuckled and debated further, surrounded by the natural serenity of the garden.\n\n"You know, Nakasone, your seat in the Prime Minister's government has really binded you to a single path. Takagi's actions have taped you to the image of reform and short-sighted change," Kishi sighed, before continuing, "It's a shame really... but there is a way out."\n\nHe looked over to Nakasone, who was eager to hear from someone far more experienced than he was. Forgetting the political maneuvering and Takagi's warnings about the man, he could not resist asking Kishi more.\n\n"My son, we've done it in the past," Kishi chuckled, "Even the Americans do it. I have no real issue with Takagi's attempt to bring in a surrogate law after the Kokumin Yusehio is repealed. A powerful opposition will defund and neglect the surrogate law to punish the Prime Minister, rather than wasting energy fighting him for it."\n\nNaksone was struck with surprise and intrigue; he could not have come up with a more sinister yet wildly effective strategy to strike in the Diet. Kishi, even as an old man, had his despicable wits about him at all times. Though attempting to resist his malevolent influences, Nakasone could not help but feel enthralled by the irresistible wisdom of the veteran."

Tired of friction, the bill was edited to appeal to and potentially command the support of Ikeda's faction of the Taisei Yokusankai in its vote. The law aimed to expand state-run orphanages and sponsored childcare, funding youth institutions with millions of yen. Takagi read out his intentions to the chamber with a strong pride in an attempt to gather attention from listening members, but few seemed interested in his proposals.\n\nEven noting the preservation of the sterilisation clause, Takagi was astonished to witness a great lazy apathy that had swept the Diet. He felt a confusing frustration; in all of his years of experience, nothing had prepared him to react to such sloth and general disinterest in this chamber. Takagi was puzzled, and as he looked to the side to prompt his cabinet for aid, they too were bewildered by the occasion. Some men nodded quietly whilst listening to the speech, and others yawned with indifference; the Prime Minister expected diligence and duty, but simply did not know how to ask for it."

It had been precisely seven hours since she first arrived, and another eight since she first woke up. The weight of her fatigue cascaded down on her shoulders, bringing her closer and closer to the brink of collapsing. Yet Kato did not. \n\There was cleaning to do, not to mention giving the cats their food. Ever since rats were discovered to be infesting the place, they had adopted five strays to keep them at bay. Kato idly wondered why they couldn't have just hired exterminators to snuff out the rats. Not to mention that she and Michi had to replace the floorboards in the playroom next week. Kato sighed, brushing her hands when she had finished distributing the cans of cat food.\n\nDinner would have to be cooked, both for herself and the children. Just more work to do.

Chatter filled the room, as the children began to show off their art to their friends.\n\nIn one hand, he held a gorgeous white and pink camellia, twirling it around occasionally. Kato moved to see the drawing he was making. It certainly wasn't the best by far -- after all, it was a ten year old drawing intricate details -- but it was leaps and bounds better than his peers.\n\n"What are you drawing?" Kato asked, expecting an answer.\n\nNo response.\n\n"Alright. If you don't mind, I'll just watch." The boy nodded his head slowly, letting Kato take a seat next to him. For the next thirty minutes, Kato and the 'camellia boy', as she had taken to calling him, stayed silent as he drew his camellia. Kato looked at the time, realizing she was late to dismiss the children for dinner. Kato stood up, cupping her hands over her mouth.\n\n"It's time for dinner! I'll be with you in a minute."

This dance had gone on for a month, with Kato and Kaori slowly becoming like mother and son.\n\nAs Kato was opening the high windows to invite the wind in, she felt a tug on her pants.

Kato replied, beginning to walk to the kitchen.\n\n"But...why don't they have parents?" Kaori called out.\n\nKato stopped in the hallway, looking back at Kaori, as her face fell. How could she explain the horrors of war to him? An innocent child shouldn't be burdened by her struggles. Where would she even start? She looked down, then back at Kaori, almost pitying him.

People like him didn't deserve quarter. Didn't deserve anything. How he was lucky enough to end up here, he didn't know.\n\n"Kaori? Why are you awake?" Kato-sensei was here. She was always so nice to him. His face suddenly soured, and he didn't respond, only acknowledging her presence by turning around.\n\n"Couldn't sleep."\n\nThe teacher walked over to his position, stopping short of the window. "Why couldn't you?" She sat down on his bed. No response from Kaori. Reaching into her pocket, she pulled out a Hershey's bar, offering it to him. He knew this trick well, and he was going to fall for it. Taking the chocolate, he began speaking.\n\n"I know now. I know why I was separated from my original parents." Kaori sighed. "I'm a bastard -- a filthy Korean. My name, the name that I was given when I was born, that is, is actually Min Yoongi." Hot tears flowed down his face, as heavy as the tapping rain outside. Kato could hear his sniffling and heavy breathing, struggling to keep his composure in the face of all-consuming fear. "If you want to--if..." The sound of sniffling and hiccups swallowed whatever else he had to say.\n\nKato looked ashamed. A tense silence filled the room for several minutes, seeming to suffocate any and all conversation before it could ever start. Min Yoongi, Naya Kaori, the camellia boy, all three parts of his identity disappeared, and a scared boy was laid bare before Kato's eyes. Kato moved to turn on the lamp, illuminating the dark room with light. His head looked down, balling up, as though to protect himself from the world.\n\n"I'll keep your secret." Kato broke the silence. She would not abandon her duty now, as a teacher, as someone who had his utmost confidence. If she wouldn't protect Yoongi from a society vehemently against his people, who would?\n\n'No one should,' she thought.

They spoke harshly to Takagi, catching his attention in an instant, but he did not reprimand them.

It was addressed directly to him, hand-written in ink from Kato, much to his surprise, in an unknown and undisclosed location.\n\nIn her writing, Kato extended her thanks to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Kido for their dignity. She noted that she is disappointed that she could not thank them both in person due to unforeseen consequences, but did express that she regarded them as men of virtue in an otherwise dejected Japanese political landscape. As he read words of respect from Kato, Takagi was overcome with a sense of honor; despite the Diet heckling her as a radical and misandrist, he felt proud that he treated her with the same respect he expected of others. As she signed off, Takagi stood still and was silent - this would be the last he would hear from her. Feeling the nostalgia of their brief encounters, he reminisced about her eloquence and fluency when speaking and the respect he had even for her bizarre politics."

The sunset's golden rays danced between the jagged skyline of Tokyo's skyscrapers, and as Takagi approached the end of his second term he could not help but consider what he would have done differently given the chance to.\n\nMemories of endless compromise flickered through Takagi's mind; the uncomfortable dealings with Kishi and Ikeda and the routine bargaining with independents haunted him. Compromising and throwing away potential for real economic restructuring consumed the Prime Minister, as he regretted leaving much of it up to the whims of Nakasone out of frustration. Takagi looked down to what he considered tainted hands, dirtied with his involvement in the political corruption and coercion he railed against in the beginning of his career. He wondered if it was a necessary evil, or simply avoidable if he just tried harder.\n\nBiting his lip, the Prime Minister retreated to his desk, falling into his leather chair and scratching his chin. He gulped and felt an overwhelming passion - after all of the struggles between these few triumphs, Japan had barely tasted reform. A sense of defeat fell over Takagi as he realized the dexterity and determination that initially surrounded his administration had since fallen to waste, leaving him to wonder if he had fallen with it."

He wiped his mouth of any spilled water droplets and leaned over the kitchen counter-top for a moment to think.\n\nHe couldn't take his mind off of it; following such resounding defeats and constant friction, Takagi was all but certain that he had been dejected from the Diet. He lived where the Prime Minister would live, and he sat where the Prime Minister would sit, but he could not command authority in the Diet for much longer. Conservatives branded him a coward and a traitor; liberals vilified him in accusations of despotism - he felt there was no balance to be struck anymore. Takagi gazed out of the window and into the estate's gardens and watched the moonlit sky beam a silver-blue light on the short grass. He found a slither of peace watching nature so still in the deadest of the night.\n\nAfter another moment of silent and demoralized pondering, Takagi made his way back to his bed and crawled underneath the sheets to find some respite.

Listening to the distant honking of horns and the chanting of protesters from his position, he held his hands behind his back and took a deep breath. He could not find peace in simply glancing at the monument of Japanese civilization anymore; it brought him nothing but cynicism and fatigue.\n\nThe newspapers this morning read that thirty more students had been reported dead following clashes with law enforcement in the rioting, and Takagi of all people felt pained by this most. He shut his eyes and reflected, questioning if he had done enough in his position of power across the empire. The Diet could barely agree on anything, and Japan's youth, a significant portion of the public, would forever remember him as a tyrant. Takagi was overcome with an immense dread, only noticeable in his deeper breaths and glossy eyes. After a gulp, he hearkened towards the darkening sky beyond the glass and turned to his desk to find a pen.

He had done this sort of work for the Tokko so many times that it was a mere routine for him. From his car, or an empty building nearby, he could watch his target throughout the day, making sure to keep note of when they left their house and for how long. After about a week of this partner, Kanda had a detailed idea of just how his target spent their time.\n\nKato Shidzue had been an interesting target for Kanda. Kato was not oblivious to her current position, as she always checked the lock on her doors twice before heading out. She would also wear dark sunglasses and a hat which obscured her face. She would do this every time she left the house, always scanning her surroundings before heading to her car. Once his week of observation had ended, the Tokko agent was ready to begin his real task.\n\nAs usual, Kato left her house at twelve o clock, something she had done for the past four days. Kanda was not especially interested in where she was going, only that she would likely be gone for at least two hours. That was more than enough time for him to work. Stepping out of his car, he headed over to Kato's house and quietly picked the simple lock. Once inside, he wasted no time in wiretapping both the phones in her home andre-locking her front door. After which he drove off in his car back to Tokko HQ. Of course, he did not want to miss the results of his work.\n\nOnce Kato had returned home Kanda and his colleagues began to listen in. Only a few minutes after she had got in the door, the phone rang.\n\n"Kato, we need to meet with you at the book club at ten o'clock tomorrow. 'Thoreau', 'Fitzgerald' and 'Hemmingway' will be there when you arrive. They'll be waiting at the corner table for you when you arrive. The address is Kawaguchi-ku Sashima 2-4-1".\n\nThe brief conversation was more than enough evidence for the Tokko. They would now be able to begin the next step of their investigation."

Their destination was the book club as described in the phone call they had recently listened in on. In order to blend in, they would enter the club as plainclothes and wait for the targets to arrive. The Tokko themselves arrived at the location at precisely twenty-past eight. As to avert suspicion, the agents all entered at random intervals. The book club was little more than a large, converted basement. The walls were lined with bookshelves, and a desk had been placed in front of what might have been a back room. The agents began to read or make small talk with the friendly, if cautious staff. So far, they were the only people there.\n\nAt around half-past nine, a man entered, who made his way over to the corner table. Three minutes later another man entered, who dallied around the shelves before joining the first man at the table. Finally, a woman entered the club and sat herself down at the table. By quarter to nine, none of the three figures had left their spots and no one else had entered. Kanda therefore judged it to be time to act. After a quick gesture to his fellow agents, he drew his gun and pointed it at the corner table.\n\nAll of you, get your hands up now. Do the cover names 'Ffitzgerald','Hhemingway' and 'Tthoreau' mean anything to you'"\n\nThe trio at the table now had four guns pointed at them. While seemingly frozen with fear, they still managed to nod in response to the question."\n\n" Good. Now get in the back room. Move slowly"\n\nThey did as they were told and were followed in by two of the Tokko. Kanda turned his attention to the book club staff.\n\n"Don't either of you dare to say a word.

Kato had passed the book club on her way to park her car, so it did not take her long to find her way back. She headed down the stairs and pushed open the door with the little bell on it. It was quiet inside. Despite the club's relatively small size, the only people she could see were the two members of staff. They did not do as much as greet Kato as she stepped inside. Immediately, she noticed that the corner table was unoccupied. Her watch told her she was exactly on time. The feeling of panic began to set in as she turned to look at the staff for a possible answer. The brief look she got from one of them turned panic into fear. With only his eyes, the staff member seemed to say:\n\n"Run"\n\nKato turned back towards the door and raced up the steps. She was stopped in her tracks by three men, all pointing guns at her. Before Kato could verbalize a plea for understanding or dialogue, the butt of a pistol connected with the back of her skull. A moment later, she hit the ground. "

Fittingly, it was Security Minister Horiki Zenjiro who brought it to the Prime Minister's office. He, and Deputy Prime Minister Kido, now waited to hear the news of Kato's arrest. For the benefit of the ministers, Takagi read the report aloud.\n\n"At twenty-past eight this morning, four plainclothes agents entered an underground book club where Kato Shidzue was scheduled to meet three individuals. Upon identifying these individuals, the agents proceeded to draw their guns and arrest them. However, a struggle with one of the suspects insured, resulting in their death. The suspect, as so far only been identified by her cover name 'thoreau'. At nine o'clock, Kato entered the building briefly before attempting to flee. She was promptly arrested by officers outside the building who were waiting in a nearby vehicle. The suspects were then taken to Tokko Headquarters for questioning. Kato was then neutralised along with the two other suspects."\n\nTakagi finished reading and let the report fall onto his desk. Kido's face was a picture of confusion.\n\n"Horikiri, surely this cannot be the entire report. What have they done to Kato?"\n\n"I checked with the Tokko twice, this is their report."\n\nBefore Kido could demand that the Security Minister demand more information, Takagi cut him off.\n\n"The details of what happened to Kato no longer matter. It's the consequences we should be worrying about. She was the figurehead of the protests and now she's missing. Once word of this spreads to the general public, they'll be no end to the chaos on the streets. We need to prepare for this, immediately. Neither of you are to leave this room until we have a plan."

 japtakagirecon.100.d:0 "The once lively and optimistic student movements that had filled the streets of Japan's cities had been replaced with two distinct forms of protests. Rioting had spread across the country like a storm, with its epicenter in Tokyo. There, armored police and water cannons had become common sights. Dozens of arrests were made each day and several universities had even been stormed by the police. While life carried on in Tokyo, an oppressive mood hung over the city. Yet In the quieter corners of Tokyo,, peaceful gatherings were still able to take place. At the spot where Kato Shidzue had last been seen, a candlelit vigil had begun, with hundreds in attendance. Apart from the sounds of distant police sirens, the street was completely quiet. At the top of the steps down into the book club basement, a number of signs had been placed with messages of appreciation for Kato and her activism. A young woman, one of the many students in attendance that had personally spoken to Kato, began to read a message she had written. The student hoped that somehow, whether Kato was, she would hear it and know that her sacrifice was not in vain. Before she had a chance to begin reading, a police car pulled up.\n\nRoof-mounted speakers loudly blared for the crowds to disperse, claiming that they were blocking a busy road. Without warning, the street began to flood with police, who set about dismantling the vigil. Those who did not move out of their way were beaten down or shoved forcefully to the ground. As more and more of the students attempted to get away, they found themselves surrounded by police from nearly every angle. What at first seemed like warning shots from the approaching police quickly began to hit the fleeing students. Panic and chaos set in, and the struggle to get away became increasingly desperate. Those caught by the police were pushed into vans and driven away, or otherwise beaten until let go. By the street was empty, the bodies of three students lay lifeless among the remains of the vigil.

 japtakagirecon.101.d:0 "News of the killings in Tokyo quickly spread throughout the country. Where once Tokyo had essentially been the only city that was being rocked by intense riots, now Nagoya and Osaka were also deeply affected. As the authorities' response to the demands of the students grew harsher and harsher, it seemed that the protesters only became more determined to fight back. Smashed windows, overturned cars and fires in the streets were now a common sight across several major cities. More peaceful gatherings were met with crackdowns from the police as soon as they sprung up. Simply being in some form of attendance was enough to warrant an arrest. Once released, they were usually beaten and bloodied, their bodies acting as a warning sign for what could happen if they did not stop protesting. Some were not so lucky. Many seemed to disappear, both literally and from police records. Others suffered the extreme brutality during the riots themselves. "Inaccurate warning shots" and "falls" were common excuses for the mounting pile of bodies.\n\nEven as the police deployed these measures against anyone found during a riot, it did nothing to end the unrest. The riots continued, growing larger and larger each day, as each death or disappearance added fuel to the fires. By this point, it was largely impossible for the general population to ignore the events happening outside their windows. Everyone knew a nephew or neighbour's child who had been blasted by a water cannon or bashed by a riot shield. Everyone had heard the stories of parents losing their children, deaths which the police or national media had yet to acknowledge.\n\nTokyo, Nagoya and Osaka were lit at night by the fires of unrest while similar flames promised to be enkindled across more cities. For the Prime Minister Takagi, the situation was exactly what he had hoped to avoid. Not only had he lost control of the protests, but now even the police were causing him trouble. Takagi could do little more than hope for a solution to materialize in time. "

The room was silent, with the exception of the distant roars of riots from an open window, and was only illuminated with the silver moonlight pouring into half the room. The men sat around a single table, all turned to face the window and pondering over the volatile future of their administration after the recent explosion of chaos in the streets of Tokyo.\n\nAfter another short period of silence, Nakasone scoffed and began to speak. He called for strong suppression; expanding the presence of law enforcement in the streets; increasing surveillance throughout the city; and using the Tokko to undermine, infiltrate, and alienate the proponents of civil unrest throughout the country. Pointing to Zenjiro, Nakasone mentioned he thought that this was the best and only way forward - noting that the rioters had forced the government's hand to take this violent path. Takagi sat still, seemingly unresponsive to the proposal as he gazed into the night sky.\n\nKido cleared his throat with a dry cough and proposed an alternative. Raising a middle ground, the Prime Minister could continue to use force in the most violent riots, whilst simultaneously strengthening the committee to reexamine the Kokumin Yuseiho. Kido noted that this would not only alienate the most radical propagators, but also amalgamate moderates in a coalition that would work with and under the government's influence.

The father of the household, a wealthy veteran, demanded his teenage daughter watch the address with him. He had lectured her about the virtues of patriotism, trying to connect with her in supporting the government in such turbulent times.\n\n"Citizens of our great nation, I greet you this evening to discuss the gathering threat to our great nation. I will not waste your time with pretty words and colorful images; the violence in our streets is unacceptable. The great chaos born from simple disagreement between us has erupted into unnecessary destruction and disorder. It is not worthy of the empire and all our forefathers have given us."\n\nThe father smiled, seeing the Prime Minister on the television, but lost his joy when looking over to his apathetic daughter, who seemed disinterested in the appeals of Takagi to end the riots.\n\n"... Which is why this government has decided to strengthen the commission to reform the Kokumin Yuseiho. If the Emperor's subjects want change, change they shall get - we will begin hard work to craft an all-inclusive settlement of this issue once and for all. However, this can only be completed with the cooperation of all parties involved, and an end to the riots."\n\nThe teenage daughter scoffed, rolling her eyes at the broadcast - much to her father's disapproval. She grumbled, hurling insults at the Prime Minister for his arrogance and misogyny before storming off to her bedroom. The girl's father was astonished and remained still in his seat, shocked by the encounter.

With your recent calls to end the violence and appeal to reason, it seems like the protests are beginning to clean themselves up."\n\nTakagi, barely conscious and exhausted from working, took a moment to process what Zenjiro had told him. He rubbed his eyes and stretched, and as he flicked through the documents he sprung into action.\n\n"As you can read in the dossier, our surveillance has reported that the moderate student unions have begun dispersing from the streets, and are now encouraging their members to write to their MPs instead."\n\nTakagi's spirits raised almost in an instant; he jumped from his seat to march over to Zenjiro, shaking his hand and thanking him for his work. He sprinted back over to his desk in the next moment and leapt to action, and with a new wind he continued the task at hand.

It was late evening, though the night sky was lit with the embers of dumpster fires and makeshift floodlights. Supported by armored vehicles, the police units trudged forward towards the chaotic crowds now scampering to face them. Bracing, they lifted their shields as thrown bricks and other debris clattered against their armor. Clashes between law enforcement and protesters erupted, and many officers were outnumbered by the maddened students.\n\nSuddenly, a crashing burst of water shot across the road and hurled many students to the ground. The water cannons were used to support the encircled officers and back the students away from them. Moreover, the pop of teargas canisters among the ruined streets dispersed many of the rioters, allowing the police units to sweep in and contain the demonstrations. Students were beaten in the streets, and hundreds of arrests were made that night.

Such was the reality, however, and the Prime Minister had little choice but to accept it. His influence over the cabinet was diminishing, and Nakasone's break from the established line could be the beginning of the end for the government.

Moreover, student-organised plays began to air commemorating Japanese victory in the Japan–Qing War, the victory in the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan, as well as entire strings of conflicts throughout the Greater East Asia War. Student radicals have begun to fill academia, and much to the government's worry, their passion for battle goes unmoderated in the ultranationalist circles springing up across the nation."

In the cooking-hot sun, the metal ships sailed the seas and navigated the coast to observe the chaos. Sailors scattered in groups on the deck of the titanic ships, gazing at the explosive marvel spewing great clouds of ash and rivers of steaming-hot lava.

Slowly, she slipped the blade away from its sheath, the last light of the sun twinkling off of its shimmering steel. The Japanese so loved their swords, passing them down from one generation to the next over hundreds if not thousands of years. They cherished them as symbols of honor, of family, of wisdom. In a way, they were the embodiment of Japan's glory and destiny to rule all the corners of the east.\n\nAnd now one was in the grubby hands of the Monkey of Dapu.

He whacked his loader on the shoulder without looking away from his sight, rotating the gun to face the light and zooming in with his sight. It was a small coastal village from the looks of it. A large fire burned in the center of it, with people dancing, enjoying the night. He saw the happy faces of celebration on each man, woman, and child's face. He began calculating the range in his head, adjusting the elevation, and with a terrible blast, he fired.\n\nThe white phosphorus shell sailed flawlessly into the crowd of people, encompassing all around the fire in a burning white cloud.

Some distrusted their words, seeing them as too good to be true, but, well, they wouldn't have been there if they refused. In the end, they all saw no better option to escape the brick wall their lives were approaching.\n\nWhen they arrived on the isolated Vitu Islands and the downtrodden were forced off ship, many suspicions among them were raised. The officers finally announced the true intentions of this journey; they were there to establish an outpost to act as a foothold for the island of New Britain south of there, for the glory of the Empire and the Co-Prosperity Sphere. They would be given adequate rations and starting supplies, but otherwise they would have to utilize the islands' own resources.\n\nThat was when the panic began. In truth, almost none of them knew how to build even a hut of straw, much less how to fend for themselves on a group of tiny islands thousands of kilometers away from home. Some began by protesting, desperately trying to explain how it must've been some kind of mistake. They begged, they pleaded, but the crew and the guards responded only by stern orders to get to work.

The crackle of gunshots and wails of natives could be heard from the distance as the surveyors awkwardly awaited clearance from the IJN.

We implore you, Takagi-san to take our advice to heart and pull back on these measures."\n\nTakagi had been expecting such a response both from his cabinet and the liberals in general. He sighed. Still, it had come faster than he had expected. "Nakasone," Takagi said, trying to sound as sympathetic as possible, "I know of your concerns. You have not approved of my colonial policies ever since I entered the Diet. I am not a politician by trade, but Japan does stand to benefit if we administer our colonies properly. After all," Takagi smirked, "is not Japan the light of all Asia?"\n\n"Prime Minister, I find that description of the kokutai as insulting. The Japanese people also have their needs, and I cannot approve of measures that squander the hard-earned victories of the Japanese people."\n\n"Of course, of course," Takagi replied, trying to calm Nakasone down. "The Japanese people have their concerns. However, think of it this way, Nakasone. Well-administered colonies would mean a lot less strain on the Home Islands. I trust you understand, for these ideas form a core part of your economic ideas."\n\n"Prime Minister, I-"\n\n"I think we are in agreement," Takagi interrupted. Nakasone backed down. He would just have to wait.

 japtakagirecon.135.d:0 "When Hisaguchi first left Hiroshima on a ship bound for Taiwan, his heart ached. He missed his home, his sweetheart. The faces of everyone he knew slipped away, leaving only hints of seasickness. He was sure that at that moment his face must have been as green as the algae that occasionally drifted beside the ship's hull. Where would he go now, he thought, his thoughts tossing, turning, listing from port to starboard every few minutes.\n\nLooking back on his days on the ship, Hisaguchi would never have thought that he would become the administrator of a portion of Karenko. At first, he had hoped that he would be placed in Tainan, where it was the most Japan-like. Instead, they stuck him in the rural areas, where friction between the local and Japanese customs tempered the dull days spent baking under the sun. He missed winter.\n\nHowever, Hisaguchi struck gold. Tokyo was particularly generous with the distribution of funds for the purposes of "aiding the local populace." At first, Hisaguchi tried to use the money in good faith. He contributed to the electrification of the district in which he resided. However, debt collectors came for him - on his trail for his gambling debts. In desperation, Hisaguchi took the money out of his safety box and waited for retribution.\n\nNothing came. Hisaguchi was happy. From then on, he took the money. At first, it was bit-by-bit, piece-by-piece. Nowadays, Hisaguchi thought of the funds as extra wages for the month. He did not care anymore - this place was a shithole, and he would do everything to forget about it."

 japtakagirecon.136.d:0 "Baba Masao looked at himself in the mirror and found an old, wrinkled man staring back. His belly was inflated, and his arms were pudgy. He chuckled. Time had left behind that dashing general, the guerilla hero who fought against the imperialist forces in Syonan. Was it really twenty years ago? Masao found it hard to believe that years could pass him by as easily as leaves picked off by the wind. At least his uniform was still in an acceptable condition. Medals gleamed on his chest. He heard a knock on the door. It was time to go.\n\nOutside, crowds of the natives greeted Masao. He got into the car, and the parade began. To his left and right the copper-skinned and sunburnt inhabitants of this place threw out cheers to him, hailing him as a hero, or so he thought. They could have been as easily throwing insults and jeers, happy that the Japanese military governor would be gone, perhaps forever. Masao preferred to look for the silver lining. He would see Japan again. A return to Kumamoto was no longer a dream.\n\nOnce they were out of sight of the crowds, Masao sat down in his car, exhausted, for some reason. His tears welled up. The chauffeur, concerned, leaned back. "Baba-sama," he said, "are you all right?"\n\nThe words that came out sounded broken, the voice of no hero."

Headquarters did not give ample explanation as to why he had to track this woman. Still, work was work, and Kenshin had to provide for himself. If being a creep was part of the job, he would damn well excel at it. It would still be nice if the agency would actually tell him why. He'd like more than "She's an activist, go see what she's doing."\n\nKenshin's tea cooled as he watched the woman enter the cafe. He averted his eyes almost immediately. No offense to the young lady, but Kenshin was a married man. He saw the lady sit down and order coffee. After that, she did... nothing. Nothing at all except read a novel that she brought with her. It was the kind of cheap trash that young men and women read in stacks these days, but whatever. He noted the title. Maybe Headquarters was looking for a survey on the youth's interests in literature.\n\nThen, an acquaintance! He set himself down on a chair opposite to her, and spoke. Of what? Is this an extramarital affair, the dramatic meeting of two lovers estranged by society? No. They talked about the arrangement of flowers. "I am serious," Kenshin wrote in his small notepad. "They talked about flower arrangement for nearly two hours. Then they left."\n\nKenshin had some choice words for his assignment."

I am here in my official capacity to christen this bridge and approve its usage as a method of public transport." He smiled to the crowd, who looked on with bored faces. Some even yawned. A camera snapped a particularly grisly image of Tanaka's bare, gap-toothed mouth. That'll be the opening of the next month's Taiwan Tabloid issue, he bet. Tanaka hated his job. Everybody hated him, yet no one wanted to vote for anyone else.\n\n"Mayor Tanaka," a reporter raised his hand. "A question?" Well, might as well. At least this guy's showing curiosity, perhaps indulging him would enliven the crowd. Maybe not. It was best to try anyway.\n\n"Ah yes, young man! What is it?"\n\nA little taken aback by the Mayor's manners, the reporter paused for several moments before he continued. Awkwardness filled the space of silence. "Well," he began. "did you outsource the concrete and cement used in constructing this bridge to a cheaper, non-government sanctioned corporation?" Now everyone was interested. Bored stares turned into nervous glances, and the crowd was stunned.\n\n"Well, I-" Tanaka began. "I think that's enough for today." With a snip of his scissors he christened the bridge, but no one clapped. The next morning's newspaper issue featured Tanaka's embarrassing gap-tooth and was headlined: BORING MAYOR CAUGHT RED-HANDED IN CORRUPTION SCHEME."

The Prime Minister, however, had no tolerance for the flashing cameras, hurrying the diplomats into a great hall to begin the talks and finalize the agreements for the end of the North Borneo Military Administration.\n\nDebating and discussing around a round table, the Prime Minister guided talks between the three nations about the territorial future of the region. Proposing many plans to the diplomats, Takagi attempted to juggle the specific and sometimes unreasonable demands of each emissary, exhausting him and his patience. In a particularly heated argument between the three, Takagi stepped away from the bickering diplomats for a moment and thought to himself, who was the Prime Minister in the room if he served these power-hungry representatives like a slave? They had apparently not noticed his momentary disappearance, and he scoffed and braced for hours of squabbling, returning to his duty with tired eyes and a forced smile."

 japtakagirecon.140.d:0 "Takagi met with his cabinet in the early morning. Almost all of his men were tired, some still yawning from barely putting themselves together when crawling out of bed, but Takagi was wide awake and freshly prepared for action. Capitalizing on their early fatigue, he came at them with a swift proposal. In order for the settlements in New Britain to be profitable, the government had to subsidize the development of the region promptly by pumping millions of Yen into the local economy.\n\nThe sheer cost of the proposal shook his entire cabinet awake as they were taken aback by the magnitude of the proposed investment. Nakasone let out a deep breath of air and cackled, unable to contain his laughter at the proposal. The Prime Minister wasn't so humored, and scowled at the minister for his inappropriate, half-awake reaction. After spending a while explaining to his men the necessity of the investment, and the stakes if they were to retract their administration's subsidizing oversight, the cabinet approved of the proposal, much to Takagi's relief."

Unfortunately, however, they were already sobered-up by midday and were wide awake to fully comprehend the ridiculous scale of Takagi's proposals.\n\nAs he insisted that New Britain needed even more investments, doubling the initial amount put into the colony, his cabinet let out a collective embarrassed sigh. Takagi, picking up on their disdain and rolling his eyes, urged his cabinet to look past the numbers and into the long term; a permanent foothold in Melanesia would be a major victory for Japan. Nakasone pinched the bridge of his nose. Kido became the first to reluctantly agree to the plan, and slowly others followed. The Prime Minister thanked his men and offered more to drink, to which they murmured polite refusal."

While settlements had been founded across the island, and refineries had been pumping oil at extraordinary rates, it was not enough to make back the money invested into the project. Takagi scoured the report for any redeeming qualities he could pretty his presentations with, but to no avail; he scrunched up the papers in his fist and dashed them across the room in a fit of rage.\n\nThe time came to present to his cabinet in the late evening, and the environment shared between his men was calm and relaxed as they unwound for the day. They clinked their glasses and applauded the Prime Minister as he stepped up to present to them in the boardroom. He gave them colorful explanations of the levels of employment on the island, as well as the soaring levels of production output from the island's offshore drilling. His cabinet applauded and thoroughly impressed, until Takagi confessed to them the profits made from the investments. The negative numbers shook the ministers. The Prime Minister pursed his lips in embarrassment and could offer nothing but banal platitudes to soften the blow."

 japtakagirecon.143.d:0 "In a small and isolated primary school by beach fronts of Soshiete-Shoto, an Austronesian boy gazed out of the window to admire a bird waddling about the sun-drenched coast. It flapped its majestic wings proudly, and irked its head back and forth as it strolled down the sandy beaches. The boy was pleased to be distracted from his Japanese class; he hated the subject, and would miss it at any opportunity he could take.\n\nMs. Asagiri, the boy's Japanese teacher, noticed his negligence and screamed his name, demanding he came to the front of the class. He was violently pulled from his serene daydreaming as the entire class of students turned to gaze at him with worry. Shocked with horror, his teacher furiously marched over to him with a deathly stare; she took his hands and dragged him to the chalkboard.\n\nHe was interrogated in front of his peers, and he broke down into tears out of lonesome embarrassment. She heckled his name mockingly, and beat him with a cane to punish him for his laziness in class and neglect of his study of the Japanese language. Ashamed and humiliated, the boy whimpered further, crying and wailing as his fellow students watched on, frozen by fear."

In disciplining the Austronesian boy, she attempted to instill a fear and respect in the other students to discipline them also, but rather she frightened the children in a moment of rage. She bore her teeth and waved her cane, causing the children to shriek.\n\nSuddenly, the bird from the beachfront swooped into the room and flapped around Ms. Asagiri. It's golden feathers shimmered in the slithers of sunlight that reached into the classroom, and flapped around her face to cause her to panic and drop her cane. She darted over the floor to grab the stick to attack the bird, and in that moment, the crying boy leapt from her lap and scurried out of the classroom, still glossy-eyed and sore from her punishments.\n\nWith the shrieking of the classroom still audible to the boy, he dashed down to the beachfront to escape his teacher's abuse and play in the sand. As the fresh, salty air blew on his face, he felt the energy to run into the sunlit shore and wash his feet in the foamy waters. He felt the fresh brush of the sea between his small toes and the small pebbles beneath his soles. The boy turned to look behind him and he saw the bird zipping out of the window of the classroom and into the azure Melanesian skies; they both knew the freedom of the natural world, and the peace that came with the glimmering seashores."
