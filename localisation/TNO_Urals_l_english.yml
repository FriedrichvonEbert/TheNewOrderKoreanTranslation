Yet the astonishing success of the training methods convinced the instructors to cast a wider net. Now, the criteria to join the Ural Guard does not depend on the recruit's prior experience, but on his toughness to march through the immense forests and snowy plains of Russia and on his willingness to, when the fires of war come, lay down their lives for this land.\n\nNew recruits from all walks of life will now be called up for our second training class."

Every kind of good was in high demand: from essentials such as food and medicine, to alcohol and pornography to ease the pain of living.\n\nFacing bandits, animals, warlords, the weather and the ever-present threat of the Luftwaffe, these groups of the few souls brave enough to handle trade are called caravans.\n\nThey could prove themselves to be a valuable addition to our forces, for their ability to keep distant posts supplied, even under overwhelming adversity, is second to none.

Some did so out of necessity recently, while others have been doing it for generations. When informed of the grave danger they are now facing, these hard men will surely take up arms along our Guard to ensure their survival.\n\nHunters and trappers will prove themselves to be a welcome addition to our efforts. With their knowledge of the hinterlands and capacity to operate autonomously for long periods they could be the perfect fit for long range scouts. They could even be grouped with some of our more experienced guards to sow immense terror in the enemy's deep rearguard, destroying their most important targets, laying traps for their troops and then vanishing through the woods without a trace."

Countless Russian men were left out of a home, a job, and a neighborhood, left to roam the countryside, doing whatever it took to survive. Though a great number of these men have turned to banditry, most of them survived on the basis of odd jobs and manual labor.\n\nThese masses of unemployed and hopeless men would be willing to enlist in the Ural Guard if offered steady employment with salaries good enough to feed their families. This coupled with a coherent pay scale and the opportunity for promotions, will encourage them to enlist for a longer period."

The ruthless attempt by the Invader to keep the Motherland from rising again with daily terror bombings targeting civilian buildings has destroyed the homes of millions of Russians, often with their loved ones still inside.\n\nThe destruction wrought by the enemy has forced these souls to roam the backwoods in search of shelter from the terrors of the Russian wastes. In many areas, the horrors of banditry were not so different from the horrors of war, and hundreds of these wanderers of the wastes arrive daily looking for the protection of the Guard.\n\nMany of these refugees are willing to enlist in our militias in exchange for the chance of owning a home. Perhaps the militia's training program could be enhanced with a section dedicated to building the houses the recruits will live in."

The Guard doesn't care for medals, honors or fame. The Guard is a family, and they want only to protect their land and people. Whenever a Guard falls in battle, his comrades feel like they've lost a dear brother."

Some of these tinned monstrosities are more than 10 years past their expiration date.\n\nThrough local farmers who have agreed to cede some of their livestock and with the labor the refugees have provided in the orchards and gardens, the Ural Guard will be able to provide their men with tasty and healthy food.\n\nBesides supplying the soldiers with the necessary nutrients for long periods of time, quality rations could cause a considerable boost to morale and attract dozens of refugees to the militia recruiting stations."

We need to organize a meeting with legitimate representatives from the communes, in such a fashion that the suspicious elements in their council can rest assured that our priority is saving lives. The few local militias they have formed will not be able to secure even the villages in an effective manner, let alone Orenburg itself.\n\nTo survive, the communes will have to accept and swallow the harsh medicine of limited centralization for an effective and well-trained military corps.\n\nIf the meeting occurs at all, we will propose that we pool our resources with Orenburg to build an effective defense force."

The necessity to protect from raids conducted by the relatively well-disciplined SS bandits is a measure that will have to be considered and implemented to deal with the more clearly identifiable threat in the short term.\n\nA darker and more mysterious danger is also looming on the horizon for the communes: the Chekist army of Magnitogorsk seems to have also shifted its keen eyes and ominous attention to the peaceful region.\n\nThe threat posed by the Black Mountain is not easily quantified, but it's necessary to prepare pre-emptive defences nonetheless. Hopefully, our delegate will reach through to the stubborn council and an effective plan can be formulated with our help."

However, their methods of achieving this security are vastly different, which has led us to support the industrious Aleksander Burba over the ineffectual communist, Georgy Malenkov.\n\nIf Malenkov were able to assert prerogative over the council, he may try to halt any negotiations with us, as informants have made us aware that he is hostile to what he perceives as a foreign power exerting influence over Orenburg.\n\nBurba, therefore, is our man. The technocrat has already been proven capable of transforming Orenburg into the city it is today after the fall of the USSR. With his focus on industrializing and centralizing  the communes further, we can be sure that he will be capable of protecting the Orenburg region. Offering to support Burba's reforms could go a long way towards strengthening the defense of the Southern Urals."

Our methods of working towards our vision of utopia may be wildly different, but if we can manage to unite on the ends, the means just become a few conversations away from being accepted by both parties.\n\nOur delegates to the Orenburg council have come back speaking highly of the moral grounds on which the communes are built. Our representatives believe that they have the capability of transforming the region for the better,and help to elevate the pain and suffering of the region. The council by and large supports our motives, praising our tenacity in hunting down dangerous criminals and protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals from oppression.\n\nIt seems our two paths are converging towards a better future for the Urals, our common interests unite us, and our unity shall lift us both."

Some within the communes fear our influence and believe that the militias who are protecting their lands are more effective and less politically dangerous.\n\nTo bypass this hiccup, we will launch clandestine, yet non-aggressive, operations into their territory to see what their defensive capabilities are, or whether they even notice our movements at all. Gathering this intel should be a simple job for the Guards. With this information, we can enter negotiations with Orenburg from a position of strength and possibly even silence opposition to cooperating with us.\n\nSome of our officers have stated the strategic significance of such a move, as it can help train our troops for more missions of this kind if we are to challenge the mysterious Lysenko or scout out Dirlewanger's bandits."

We, however, cannot simply state how pathetic the current defensive capabilities are without raising some worrying political concerns with the council and losing the diplomatic ground we have painstakingly built.\n\nIt has been decided that we should give our evaluation a mild makeover, propping up certain weak elements whilst not shifting away from our argument that the communes require our support. One of our officers had the genius idea to implement into the report to the council the idea that Orenburg had built a good military foundation, but with our help, could truly reach their own potential.\n\nIn this way we may be able to overcome arguments that warn of our influence and finally begin to help the communes help themselves."

Yet despite our warnings, the slow, unrelenting arrow of time is marching onwards towards their doom, with each tick getting closer to the event horizon, whilst the council is still fighting amongst itself.\n\nUnless they begin to take the threats seriously and finally listen to our vital advice, we may have to force them to pay attention.

It is likely the SS renegades will smash through our defense in the onset or outset of the rape of the communes.\n\nNeither we, nor the woefully unprepared anarchists, could hope to withstand Dirlewanger's forces on our own. The aggressive fighting spirit and sheer brutality of the SS will overwhelm our limited forces if we decide to stand on our own.

When the snow threatened to consume us, we left the lands that were once our prison and embarked on a grueling march to seek refuge in the south. We have lost so much and have seen all the darkness this new world has to offer, but in the end we made it to the lands we now call home.\n\nThough we have suffered far more than all our ancestors before us, we have never let the darkness corrupt our hearts. When we arrived beneath the slopes of the Ural mountains, we found all manner of survivors, wanderers, and innocents in need of protection from the dangers of the world. We became their shield, and soon more and more of them became drawn to the warm fires within our new fortresses. Over this last decade we have trained without rest, honing ourselves into a force of warriors pledged to defend those who cannot defend themselves.\n\nWe have recently come into contact with a loose collection of communes around Orenburg. They are a spirited but disorganized people, defenseless against the horrors of the wastes. Some of our soldiers have begun heading west to offer aid and support to their villages, though our men have not always been greeted warmly.\n\nThere are also worrying rumours coming from the east: villages ablaze, families disappearing in the night, and of Germans on the march once again.

While those arriving from the South speak of an increase in the bandit activity we have been battling against for years, the refugees from the east bring stories of a new threat.\n\nIn hushed tones they whisper of entire villages vanishing in the night, the houses and fields abandoned, their former inhabitants lost to the world. Rumors are spreading that the Black Mountain, long abandoned and forgotten, is stirring again, the smog of its factories once more blackening Russia's skies. Some claim to have seen men wearing ghoulish suits and masks moving within the smoky haze, dragging their unsuspecting victims back to their mountaintop lair.\n\nAs these disturbing reports increase in both quantity and severity, our eastern scouts have reported that the 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD has fortified the mountains around the old mining town of Magnitogorsk. The remnants of the division are apparently acting under the direction of Trofim Lysenko, a popular scientist in the pre-war Soviet Union. Observation of the division has revealed that they have reopened the mines and factories around the fabled Black Mountain, though their intentions are unknown as of now.\n\nThe connection between Lysenko's reappearance and these stories is impossible to miss. Our eastern scouts have already been ordered to continue their observation of the mountain to see what they can uncover. Additional guards have been recalled from their normal patrols to reinforce the rangers currently stationed in the east.

This loose assembly of German war criminals, Russian bandits, and Kazakh raiders has grown to be the largest army in the region, and their violent debauchery is almost single-handedly responsible for the refugee crisis that has put us in such a precarious situation. Even worse, should the bandits continue to grow in strength, they could soon be bold enough to mount a full attack on the League. We are strong in spirit but few in number, and are already struggling to defend our borders. Should Dirlewanger invade, it may be the end of everything we have worked so hard to build.\n\nIt has been decided that, with the Black Bandits representing the greatest threat to peace and stability in the area, what scant few men and resources we have available will be concentrated in the south to prepare for the coming war. It has also been recommended that the people of the Southern Urals under our protection be organized into militias to supplement our forces to help offset the numerical disparity between our enemies and ourselves. This has become a topic of fierce debate, as some commanders feel that without the militias, our defeat is inevitable, while others believe that creating them would be akin to using those we have sworn to protect as meat shields. Either way, time is running short. The bandit king is gathering his strength, and his lust for wealth and violence must be sated soon and it is well known that he is not a patient man."

Made up up rapists, murderers and other scum of German society, they were the Nazi's favorite attack dog and the terror of many innocent Russian families but stopped following Berlin's orders during the West Russian War and now answer only to their devilish commander.\n\nTestimony given to us by the refugees arriving each day tell us of the sheer vileness of those men. Tales of torture, rape, and murder for sport of defenseless women and children are spreading through our camps like wildfire by the families fleeing the Black Brigade's terror. Many are calling for the Guard to act and stop this terrible threat.\n\nFurther scouting has detected that the Brigade is now based around Orsk. Reconnaissance photographs coupled with interrogations of captured Brigade elements have indicated that Dirlewanger is on an arms and soldier procurement spree, attracting villains from every corner of the land with the promise of power, riches, and women. It is clear that he intends to continue his reign of terror."

Like it or not, the reality of the situation is that the Guard alone will not be enough to stop Dirlewanger's bandits, especially if Lysenko continues to press us as well. Because of this, it has been decided that the people of the Urals must be called to action, and militias must be formed.\n\nWhile the militias will provide a much needed source of manpower to augment the small size of the standing guard, few of our generals are happy. Most of the people of these mountains have seen little combat, so it has been decided that the militias will only consist of those who have fought before, or who have talents and skills that would lend themselves to warfare. Even with this stipulation in place, our commanders are reluctant to send those who thought they had managed to escape war back onto the battlefield after living in peace for so long. For years the quiet, sheltered lives of the inhabitants of the Southern Urals have been a point of pride for us, proof of our effectiveness in defending our adopted home. Now the time has come where we must disturb the peace we have worked so hard to create, and must prepare those we have protected to be thrown back into danger once again. Mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, all will be called upon to leave behind the lives they have worked so hard to rebuild. To fight against the darkness one last time. To defend their home.

Although this is all well and good, there is a growing fear among the council and the people of Orenburg in general that this current relationship is not enough to truly defend us from the various bandits and kidnappers that lurk in the Urals. Our Council is somewhat divided on the matter. Some fear that the League and its powerful military will bully us or try to take control of Orenburg should we allow them too much influence over our affairs. For this reason, many of the communes are at risk from bandit raids and the League are usually powerless to stop them.\n\nWhile we do maintain some militias, they are hardly an effective deterrent to outside threats and the bandits that already lurk within our lands, often arriving far after the attacks have ravaged our people. Some on the council have suggested that the current arrangement is defence enough against the raiders and that their presence is unavoidable. Others have pointed out that Dirlewanger's Brigade could easily slip past our defences and begin a series of raids that would end in our destruction. According to them, our only hope is with the Ural League, and that any fears of a takeover are ridiculous, stating that if they wanted to take control they would have done so already. They propose a simple meeting, in a location that would not upset too many of the council members and that it will focus on establishing a more official relationship, and nothing more just yet.

We prove our worth and ability time and time again, and yet, soon we might not be enough. As the guardians of the mountains, we have faced long odds before, but this time it is different. Dirlewanger's Bandits are the largest and most sadistically violent group to have ever threatened the region, far surpassing any of the wannabe warlords and nomadic thugs that we have wrangled with before. The few soldiers that Lysenko does have are possibly the best equipped men in all of Russia, armed with newly made machine guns and armor piercing ammunition, while our men fight with hunting rifles and scavenged bullets. These two threats may prove to be the first and last enemies the Ural league cannot stop, unless something is done soon. It is with this reasoning that Colonel Ilya Starinov has presented his planned reforms for the Ural Guard.\n\nWhile many have advocated for the Guard's recruiting standards to be lowered, allowing more men in and increasing the size of the army we can wield, Starinov's plan calls for the exact opposite. He argues that the Guard has not gone far enough in cultivating its elite status, and must reform itself into what would be the most well-trained force in not only Russia, but the world. He calls for a new training regimen that would, in his words, "Ideally disqualify 70 to 85 percent of the trainees before completion". This training would include spending weeks in the wilderness surviving off of nothing more than what they can find, being drilled endlessly on conventional combat, guerilla combat, urban combat, close quarters combat, nighttime combat, and any other kind of combat that their instructors can think of. Put simply, they will be put through a training so difficult that those who come out on the other side will see real war as a relief."

It was an unpleasant surprise when he was told that a "survivalist" was being sent into town to help train the militia. As far as Feodor was concerned, his men knew everything they needed to, and some hillbilly from the wastelands would be more of a burden than anything else.\n\nWhen the man finally arrived, all of the militia men couldn't help but stare. His beard wasn't as long as they had joked it would be, but it wasn't short. What was most surprising about him was his age. None of the men dared ask, but there was no question that this man had seen Russia collapse not once, but twice.\n\n"I don't enjoy speaking, so you children should listen. I have been living off of the land for longer than any of you have been alive. When I was seventeen, the Reds burned my home and forced me into the wild.

An old Soviet siege cannon was dragged out from the Urals and began shelling the steel-reinforced gates, while a diversionary offensive from Communal militias distracted the defenders. What Lysenko's men did not expect, however, was an attack from the mountain itself: a grizzled band of the Ural Guard's finest veterans had scaled the side of the mountain fortress using old grappling hooks and climbing tools, and launched a surprise strike where the defences were the weakest, because no one should have been insane enough to attempt that.\n\nAs the assault team reached the walls, the defenders realized they were being flanked and opened fire on the climbing Guards, killing several men before they could retaliate, but it wasn't enough: in mere minutes, the elite Guards seized key locations within the fortress and started wreaking havoc. As the last defenders retreated before being surrounded, the siege cannon finally tore down the front gate, allowing the militias to storm in as well. The battle proceeded through the rest of the fortress, many dying to the traps within, until they finally reached Lysenko in his personal study, finding him experimenting even in his last moments.\n\nThe former scientist, mad from his defeat, released his prisoners, declaring that his new breed of super soldiers would defend him to the last, but seemed surprised when the crowd immediately turned on him: his desperate screams as he was torn apart by the men he had tortured for all these years will surely haunt the dreams of those who witnessed it."

Against such things, he tells them, there is no cure but unity and brotherhood.

Military advisors will be sent on both sides to ensure security, economic support will be forthcoming to be used at Council discretion, and yearly bilateral talks will ensure this relationship continues to develop at an even pace.\n\nThe assembly listens, thinking.

All heads were turned towards him, and all conversations had died with frightful speed. Except for a few slight whispers, the room was eerily silent. The slender priest tightly gripped the small, wooden cross he always held deep in his pocket - after all, even great men may feel insecure, and require the comfort of their loved ones - and then began to speak with his eloquent, articulate yet sombre tone.\n\nFirst, he asked for a representative to accept the gift he had brought from the Guards. After a brief murmur among the council members, a muscular, bearded man, likely a farmer or manual worker judging by the calluses on his hand, reached out to introduce himself to Mendriks. Surprisingly, the man pulled a beautifully woven winter coat from his chair and entrusted it to the priest, uttering what most probably were practiced lines, that this gift was "a show of Orenburg's spirit".\n\nYet, this was not seemingly an unfriendly gesture, and the priest was almost amused to see the burly man nervously fidgeting, waiting for his reaction. With a large, friendly smile, Mendriks returned the pleasant gesture with his own gift, an adorned knife, a symbol of the strong, yet protective, nature of the Ural Guard. Deep down in his thoughts he already felt the glimmer of inspiration for an address, much like a sermon, as he observed the stark contrast between the two gifts and what they represented.

As Mendriks recounted this with his usual charismatic eloquence, he noticed that the ensuing discussion on how to best treat Orenburg, whether to follow the Guard's mission to secure the helpless, or to use its overwhelming military force to assert authority of the area and use its resources to expand the Guard's powerbase, was likely going to be a close one to call.\n\nNot everyone here had suffered the soul crushing, oppressive destruction that the Gulags had forced onto the original members of the League; these people did not understand how power corrupts a man's humanity itself, warping it into a manifestation of its worst sins.

However, until now the League's policy of non-interference has prevented these politicians from achieving any major successes, and there has been a equally powerful faction arguing for cooperation, or even an alliance with the league.\n\nUnfortunately, a recent speech by Mendriks seems to have dashed those hopes permanently. To the assembled soldiers and officers, he asserted that the League will be enforcing its hegemony over the Urals, including Orenburg, "for the Ural People's own good".\n\nAlready, the precarious political balance in the Commune has been disrupted. Urgent preparations for conflict are being made, but the fighting that has broken out between several factions is like to render these moot. Civilians have withdrawn to their homes in terror, to await the storm about to arise from what was thought to be the least dangerous of Orenburg's neighbors."

In others however, the League's operational capacity has been severely limited by their inability to find willing collaborators.\n\nThankfully, commander Mendriks seems to have found a solution. In a speech to a cohort of assembled Guardsmen, the League's supreme leader announced that pursuant to its goals as "protector" of the peoples of the southern Urals, they will be refraining from any aggression with all "deserving" neighbors.\n\nWhile it's nice to know that the nearby army of elite, disciplined soldiers will not be smashing through Orenburg's pathetic, perpetually squabbling militia to burn their homes and steal their food, this announcement hasn't really changed the people's view of the league. Those who saw the League as an ally for stability and development have cited this pronouncement as proof of their claims; while those distrustful of the League have used this as proof that not only are they an enemy, but they're a crafty one."

About all the other warlords and tyrants here? Comrade, I can tell you their history, but this kind of evil can only be truly understood by experiencing it first hand."\n\n"Most Nazis, surprisingly, are quite banal once you know more about them. Once they're done killing and looting, they go back to a normal family and a boring life. They aren't uniquely smart or evil, they just do what they do, and they do it well. It's almost bureaucratic for them: killing an innocent, burning a house with the people still inside, levelling a city with bombs, is like paperwork. They feel no joy, no pleasure, only duty fulfilled. But Dirlewanger, see, he isn't like them. He felt a sense of joy when he killed his first man; some Belgian private during the Great War, apparently. And that joy never stopped. When he got his chance to return home and live a normal life, he always refused it. Always. The Bandit King does what he does because deep down, he can't stop. Lysenko is cut from a similar cloth, of course; he has no regard for human life. However, he does not do it for pleasure, but for his personal perversion of science: discovery and invention make him do what he does. The monsters he makes, the tortures he inflicts, every scream, every death is for him like a step closer to being remembered like Einstein or Edison, at least in his mind."\n\n"Mother Russia has had to bear the brunt of tyranny for quite a while, and we will have to endure it quite a while longer. But if we ever want it to end, Dirlewanger and Lysenko must go. They will not stand for a free and united nation. Why would they? If one existed, they'd be the first to be jailed or executed. So we must defend ourselves against them, and seek their end. Understand?""

The raiding party was dismayed by the stiff resistance, like the wolf finding out that even rabbits have teeth, but still they assaulted Prechistenka, rabid animals desperate for food and blood. Grenades, machine guns, molotovs and even a score of Kazakh horsemen were thrown at the defenders, but time and time again they were repelled: the village was a fortress, every house a bastion, every road a barbican, every soul a sentinel.\n\nOne by one, the Ural Seven fell. One by one, they bravely fought and died in defence of the innocent, spurring their charges to keep fighting with their dying breath. And they did.

Despite a few run-ins with brigands, within a fortnight they reached the frigid outskirts of the Vorkuta Gulag. The camp sat empty, practically untouched since they had left it. They spent several days there, reflecting on how far they had come, leaving memorials for those who were not alive to make this pilgrimage, and hunting for anything they might have left behind.\n\nFor one soldier, however, the beginning would also be his end. For all the victory, for all the memories, his heart ran empty. He rubbed the stump of his arm where one of Dirlewanger's men had hacked it off, and thought of all the comrades he had lost in the labyrinthine halls of Lysenko's lab. Sitting in his old cell, he thought of all the men who had been imprisoned alongside him here, none of whom now remained. He wept bitterly as he questioned why he alone was still here, if not only to suffer. The answer suddenly was clear in his mind.\n\nHis comrades found him on the floor of his cell, pistol still in hand, his cheeks wet with tears.

Kolyma was a place no man deserved, reminiscent of the Devil's icy resting place: if anyone had read Dante's Inferno, it would remind them of Caina, the frozen land of Cain and his fellow traitors, where the damned endured eternal cold without the freedom of death. It was the past, but the past never faded, and Anatoly had done things in those frozen camps that made him shiver from something completely unrelated to the cold chilling him to the bones.\n\nOutside the walls, little lay: the occasional nomad, cold and distant, offered little more than soup and bread, and ruins were all he could see by the old road.. Slowly going South, some semblance of civilization returned, and with it, humanity. Bandits and criminals, thieves and beggars, but at least he could find shelter from the cold.\n\nAnatoly dimly recalled that eastwards there was ocean, and China. Westwards, maybe a Russian state lied. Perhaps more humane than the old Union. The old man resolved to march towards the setting sun.\n\nWhether by his own perception or by the Earth's movements, the days got longer. There was no longer snow, and wheat shone golden on the horizon. A fire, somewhere out there, glowed every night. It was on one long day that Anatoly arrived at a small village, somewhere high in the Urals. The guards, hardened by life outside the comforts of the developed world, asked for identification. When Anatoly expressed that he lacked any, they asked him for his tale then, and the man began, from the distant past inside the camps to the more recent years in the wild Russian East. Upon hearing about his time in the gulag, they beckoned him into the guard post and poured a glass of vodka for him. Only the bravest survived the camps, and Anatoly was one of them.

 URL.107.d:0 "Doubtlessly, you have heard of the defeat of the Hitlerite bandits in the south and the death of Dirlewanger. That the black mountain, so long feared and ominous by the people of the southern Urals, is being scaled by our men at this moment. I will not use this opportunity to lecture you on the superiority of our forces or how we are unbeatable, like some might. Rather, I want to tell you about the times when we were without hope and filled with fear. One might wonder why I tell you about the times of hardship and suffering we had to endure right now. Surely we should be giving thanks for our victory?\n\nWhen we were in Vorkuta, one would hardly see any reason to thank God then. But we stuck together, and persevered. On the march, many fell by the wayside. Nobody would be blamed for doubting the journey we took. But still we pressed on. Even when the menace to the east threatened to overwhelm us and destroy all we held dear, we kept going. Why?\n\nAt every step, from the gulag, to the march, to the battlefields of the southern Urals, we believed in a final victory. That God would help us, no matter how dire the circumstances. He was with us when we starved. He was with us when we mourned our fallen. And He is just as with us at our moment of victory.\n\nI want you to remember this moment of joy and triumph. But I want you to remember the moments of sadness and hardship as well. For when sadness and hardship visit you again, you know that through your will and your faith in our Lord, you will just as surely triumph once again."

 URL.108.d:0 "It was early morning, with few rays of light shining through the sky, when a Ural League outpost in the southern hinterlands was attacked by Dirlewanger's SS Bandits. They managed to sneak through the perimeter patrols and kill the lone lookout before they could alert the rest of the detachment, and quietly headed for the tents where the Guards were sleeping.\n\nHowever, their Raid had been noticed: a young cadet, barely fifteen, one of the Sons of the Guard, found the sentinel's corpse while on duty to bring him coffee. The quick-thinking boy took the submachine gun from the dead soldier and fired into the air, alerting the sleeping Guardsmen: within seconds, they scrambled to their arms and took the invaders by surprise, in a surprising turn of events, driving them out.\n\nAfter the blood dried,the cadet who saved the entire garrison was taken to Ust-Katav where he was paraded through the streets along with the Guards who owed their lives to him. After the parade, the young trainee received a Hero's Medal from Father Janis Mendriks, the Ural League's head himself, and the news of the event was spread far and wide. The best part of the celebration, however, was when an old woman came forward from the crowd, claiming that she knew the young man: she had been a dear friend of his mother back in their small village, and the two women had sworn a mutual oath, to take care for each other's offspring if anything had befallen one of them. When the hamlet had been attacked by bandits, the boy was with his parents as they fled alone to the forest, pursued by Kazakhs, and she had lost any trace of the family ever since. All newspapers in the Ural League bore the heart-warming photo of the boy hugging the old woman in tears, tightly holding the last remaining piece of his childhood."

 URL.109.d:0 "The Ural training procedure has drawn much criticism from within our administration. Most troops are constantly drilling throughout the day, and at best get 6 hours of sleep at night. They have a 10-minute break for each meal, only one set of clothes, which makes drilling even more rigorous, and if they have any free time at all, it's spent preparing for the next day of drilling.\n\nDespite these conditions, no one was expecting what happened last morning. At 7:30, Siyankin Gerasim Georgiy failed to report to duty,leading to drill instructor Savva Belov to search for him. Another 10 minutes passed before the drill was interrupted from the sound of 2 rounds going off in the barracks. Officers and soldiers rushed inside to find the officer lying dead, and Siyankin pointing the rifle's barrel to his mouth. With more than fifty spectators, the soldier then pulled the trigger.\n\nThe incident shocked the nation, and today's newspapers are filled with analyses and critiques, but many still defend the spartan conditions of the soldiers: they believe that the people of the Urals need to make sacrifices in order to protect themselves from foreign threats. However, there have been those who disagree, stating that what happened yesterday will happen more and more times, as recruits are driven mad from fatigue and stress while their officers enjoy much better standards: in difficult times, even eating fresh bread instead of flavourless soup can drive men insane with rivalry. They argue that there is no use in constant drilling if the soldiers will later ignore orders or, worse, revolt or simply kill themselves. Whatever stance people have taken on the issue, it has certainly become divisive."

The two most common backgrounds amongst its members are being either scholars of different fields, or veterans of our numerous conflicts. They claim to face the terror and evil lurking around us with their courage and intelligence. With premises such as these, the announcement that one of the council members was being exiled for cowardice in combat came as a shock.\n\nEarlier yesterday, a man came forward in private to some of the council members and informed them that one of the councilmen had lied about his previous service. The man said that they had encountered a gang of raiders, riding around on trucks with large machine guns. When they opened fire, the councilman dropped his gun and ran as fast as he could, while the rest of the squad fought back. They suffered heavy casulties, and the man held a grudge against the councilman, though he never felt brave enough to come forward until just then. Immediately, the officer was brought before a court martial: the soldier's story was confronted by hearing other squad members involved in the same operation, and their matching depositions, each judged precise and true, sealed the case.\n\nThe officer was stripped of his rank and relieved with dishonor from the Ural Guard. As an appendix, the verdict confiscated all his ill-earned money and sentenced him to exile. The man, now a civilian, returned his uniform and equipment, and left the barrack with only a bag with some food and his clothes, as his former comrades looked at him with eyes full of scorn, and the crowd jeered at himm. He quietly walked out of the camp, and the doors closed behind him. The League has plenty of room for exiles, refugees and the damned, but there is no space for cowards."

They looked up to him, and he looked after them in turn: they had all sworn to do everything to protect each other, even if it killed them. Dozens of times, they had kept their word, taking wounds and facing hardships together. Alexei more than all others, but he didn't consider himself superior: he may have been stronger and with a keener aim, but the others fought with all they could give, and that was enough. Finally, the day came when Alexei fulfilled his oath for the last time: in an act of supreme heroism, he ran to the grenade which had been thrown inside the house they were defending and launched himself on it, covering his comrades with his body.\n\nThe funeral service, as per his request, was short and quiet: his reposed body was dressed in his uniform, to which his commanding officer had pinned his posthumous medal, then the coffin was hauled out by his squadmates and lowered into a hole in the ground. As one of the soldiers began filling the hole with dirt, a priest read from the Bible and said some nice things about him. Then, the squad sergeant came forward and spoke, telling funny stories about him, like his attempts to hit on an uninterested woman, or the times he would get piss drunk and laugh so loudly he would wake up the entire barracks up from their sleep. Some laughed at this, but most cried, miserable at the thought that their friend was no longer with them.\n\nFinally, the hole was replaced by a small earth mound, and the sergeant played a short rendition of "Katyusha", his favorite song, with all soldiers forming the choir, and then they all left, talking amongst themselves or staying quiet. "What a damn shame," the sergeant muttered under his breath."

They were a scourge not only upon our nation, but upon humanity itself: imagine a world, where millions of innocents are sacrificed on the altar of the perversion Lysenko called "science", a world where the air is filled with smoke, and blood, and screams. Yet, despite all they have thrown at us, we have persevered. We have beaten them at their own cruel game, but we didn't become like them: unlike those devils, WE are still humans. Through the dark and sterilized hallways of Black Mountain, our comrades died for peace, for a promise of something better, and we fulfilled that promise time and again: today, we are triumphant! We have been hardened by the events of our past, and our struggle against Lysenko has been no different.\n\nIt will become a part of us and the generations that follow, in this cycle that is the ultimate struggle for survival. Order has returned to the Urals: no longer will our people live in fear, barricading themselves in their villages, fearing the night and the monsters that come with it, for these creatures are finally dead: now, they lay silent and frozen, kept securely inside graves dug deep into the earth, thrown back into the darkness that generated them, and that will hold them forever."

Victory against so-called "noble successors" of a madman, who had gone mad themselves. Victory against the same lies, and the same populism that threw the old rulers of this land, the old Union, into decadence and ruin.\n\nDespite all their efforts, our people didn't fall for those old lies a second time. The lies of Bukharin, Lenin, Lysenko, and Bunkov. In a last push, our troops stormed the city of Magnitogorsk, through smelteries and bureaucratic offices.

We thought they would come and go like all bandits before them, but we were wrong. We should have known that all SS, even the traitors among them, are deadlier than even the most poisonous snake. Like rotten meat for vermins and flies, the insane German turncoat gathered hundreds of men just like him, lured by the promise of loot and carnage, a never ending nightmare of violence and blood. His small group grew larger, the raids became full-scaled offensives against our villages, then our cities, and finally the very heart of our nation, of our people.\n\nHowever, their very greed became their grave. Dirlewanger's insane drive to loot and rape everything he sees finally doomed him, as he ruled over a circle of drunkards and drug addicts and relied on them as if they were competent: perhaps it was desperation, or perhaps he had fallen so deep into his own madness that he truly believed they would serve him with diligence.\n\nWith the capture of Orsk, the "capital" and only real settlement within the SS turncoat's petty realm, and the confirmed death of Dirlewanger himself, his reign of terror is finally over! The city has been purged of all signs of his deranged rule, from the swastikas to the gallows filled with the hanging bodies of those brave yet foolish enough to face the devil with their bare hands. When the civilians saw our soldiers entering the city, and disarming their slave drivers, they filled the roads to celebrate our soldiers, though there were many sightings of former bandits lynched and torn apart by those they had oppressed until the day before. No longer will Dirlewanger fill our nightmares, no more will he threaten the lands we hold so dear to our hearts!"

Many of them die in the hills that many are already calling the Meat-grinders, against a foe whose ranks never thin out as much as the League would like.\n\nThere is another name for those blood-soaked hills, one that is more popular by far: the Mistakes. And who can blame the public for latching on?\n\nIn quiet desperation, the leaders met in a windswept, nameless part of the city - the main complex is already accosted by multiple demonstrations of the few remaining citizens still present - and discussed plans. They circled around the normal plans; further mobilisation of reserves, exploitation of advanced weaponry, the usage of regiments still in basic training. All are soundly rejected, as everyone anticipates. After all, these solutions don't serve an inherent purpose. No, their sole purpose is to guide a reluctant council, by way of trial and error, to a single, disconcerting conclusion.\n\nMendricks breaks the deadlock as usual, reportedly snapping at his Advisors to "stop wasting his time and the lives of soldiers", before authorising a formal request to Orenburg.

Women and children carried precious heirlooms, items of invaluable significance treasured in their families for decades or even centuries.\n\nAs those not strong or brave enough to fight evacuated, the remaining village folk were shouting and receiving orders, tossing guns to one another and inspecting the weapons they would be soon using. Many of the firearms were in a truly sorry state, not used since the Great Patriotic War and intended only as trophies and sorry reminders of a time long lost. Still, a gun was a gun, and none of those gathered felt the need to complain. Loading their weapons with ease, many eyed their meager allocation of ammunition nervously. The stockpile was small enough already, and they still had to make sure to save one bullet each in case of the worst.\n\nThe irregulars looked grim as they took up their positions. Deep down, all knew they would not live to see another day. This was, barring divine intervention, their final stand. Though they could not save themselves, they could still make time for their families and other refugees. A noble sacrifice would be a worthy closing chapter of the Ural League's efforts to rid the world of evil. A slow death would even be acceptable as long as it meant they could aim another shot and pull the trigger again.\n\nIn the distance, the faintest hum of motors started to be heard. The makeshift militiamen all fell silent. All that could be heard were heavy vehicles, and the lone, sad song of a solitary bird who had stayed to enjoy the coming spectacle.

Not an hour earlier it had hosted a spectacular carnage as the remnants of the Ural Guardsmen laid down their lives to cover the escape of their loved ones. Bitter fighting had inflicted terrible casualties on the invaders as everytime a successful breach was made within the defences, it only resulted in the guards tactically retreating further into the village. Every house had been turned into a fortress, and several key locations had been booby-trapped to explode on the assailants as soon as the defenders had left. In addition to that, all buildings they had to abandon were set on fire, which protracted the siege late into the night. Only once the Guards numbers had been whittled down to a mere fraction of the initial defenders, were the invaders able to storm the final defensive line established in the village centre itself. The reprisals were vicious and hate-filled, but many of the last Guards preferred to commit suicide rather than falling into the hands of their enemies. Not only had the defenders been able to buy an unexpected amount of time but using their scorched earth tactics they also had taken away any cover opportunities for the besiegers. Now nothing of their heroic sacrifice remained: the barricades had been torn down, all buildings still standing had been levelled, and the bodies had been burned along with the rest of the ransacked village."
