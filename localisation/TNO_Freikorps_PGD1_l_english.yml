 POLITICS_Ulrich_Wegener_DESC:0 "Enough is enough. No more hiding in the sewers beneath Germania. No more shivering in the cold nights of the sane citizens of Germany's basements. No more running. No more hiding.\n\nUlrich Klaus Wegener is a new face in terms of leadership within Germany, only having served at the age of fifteen within the last days of the war, being just a mere teenager as he bore witness to the glorious days of victory on the horizon. Young Ulrich was told that Germany would prosper forevermore, knowing not of difficulty or obstacle as it would reign over the globe as the Supreme Master of the World, and no true Sons of Germany would ever suffer again!\n\nBut none of that fucking happened.\n\nInstead, Young Ulrich would bear witness to suffering and hunger, as the German economy crashed. Realizing war was brewing on the horizon, the up-and-coming leader of the Beserkers, Germany's chief Special Forces and Counter-Terrorism unit, aligned himself with Speidel's faction during the Bürgerkrieg in order to stand with some sense of sanity within the German nation at that point; yet, sanity would not win out, would it?\n\nThus began Wegener's true rise to leadership. When he helped lead the anti-militarists into hiding, finding shelter only in the rat-infested shadows as the Schutzstaffel prowled every corner, the Wolf ready to strike at any moment. Now, however, the Wolf Pack finds itself torn apart, each side ripping and tearing at each other's throats. In the midst of this chaos, in the wake of this insanity, in defense against this terror, Ulrich Klaus Wegener stands alone in fighting a double-fronted war, with every side calling for his death. Or so he would believe."

 FPG_first_and_foremost:0 "First and Foremost"
 FPG_first_and_foremost_desc:0 "Not for nothing was the 1st Panzergrenadier Division honored with the epithet 'Berserker'. Their service record is equally glorious as the sagas of old. Every man is worth a dozen of the enemy, and has proven it beyond all doubt."
 
 FPG_backs_to_the_sea:0 "Backs to the Sea"
 FPG_backs_to_the_sea_desc:0 "Hemmed in by the Oder and Elbe rivers, and with the Baltic at their back, PGD. 1's supplies are strained and their position tenuous. At Wegener's command, they have instituted strict rationing, and are restricted to purely defensive operations."
