#Leaders
POLITICS_John_XXIII_DESC:0 "His Holiness John XXIII, baptized Angelo Maria Roncalli, is the current pope of the Catholic Church, vicar of Christ on Earth and spiritual leader to the millions of Catholics of the globe. Born into a family of sharecroppers in northern Italy, Angelo joined the Franciscan Order: once ordained as a man of faith, young Angelo showed his talent as an administrator, rapidly climbing the priestly ranks. Serving in WWI as a chaplain in the Regio Esercito, Angelo later became an emissary of the Holy See: when WWII began, Angelo, now a bishop, was in Bulgaria, secretly helping the local Jews escape persecution and flee to the Levant.\n\nAfter the war, Angelo was recalled to Rome and elevated to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Pius XII. In 1958, when Pius XII died, the Church was bereft of the man who had led it across the turbulent years of WWII. Bitterly divided between opposing political factions, the Conclave opted to elect an uncharismatic, old Pope who'd do next to nothing during his pontificate, allowing the cliques of the Church to continue their squabbles: thus, they picked the humble former Nuncio, Angelo Roncalli, and they couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nPope John XXIII proved himself to be an energetic and charismatic reformer; despite his doctrinal traditionalism, the new Pope became a harsh critic of the fascist regimes of Europe, speaking in favour of democracy and denouncing those in the Church who collaborated with oppressive policies. As a symbol of hope, inspiring even non-Catholics, he became universally loved among the populace, with the Italian people even nicknaming him "the Good Pope" despite his frictions with the fascist government. However, the Church John XXIII leads is still divided, and with his age growing and his health declining, no one knows whether the path set forth by the Good Pope will be followed by his flock - perhaps, only God, in his infinite wisdom, knows."

POLITICS_CHARLOTTE_DESC:0 "Princess Charlotte Louise Juliette Grimaldi is the current ruler of the Principality of Monaco, but most days she really wishes she wasn't. Her path to rulership was fraught with strife and conflict since her very birth in 1898: an illegitimate child of prince Louis II, who had no siblings nor legitimate children, she was only made the heir apparent (despite this being against Monegasque law) to prevent the Principality from being inherited by the legal successor, a German prince, in order to avoid an international crisis between France and the German Empire.\n\nThe young princess married a French count: however, as he was homosexual, her marriage was unhappy and she had a well known affair before finally divorcing. During WWII, when Monaco was occupied by Mussolini's troops, Charlotte asked prince Louis II to let her renounce her succession rights, allowing her son Rainier to become the heir. Prince Louis refused this proposal, as Rainier was a well known sympathizer for the Allied cause, and with the Axis triumphing across the world, the Prince feared that having him as the heir would seal the doom of the tiny nation.\n\nDespite the Axis's final victory, doom did not come: Monaco bent itself to the the new European overlords, and when Louis died in 1949, Charlotte became Princess. However, her role in politics was very limited, and most power ended in the hands of a clique of ministers and administrators revolving around her son, the ever more energetic Rainier. With Monaco growing ever richer and more glamorous, as foreign stars and businessmen come to squander their wealth in its beaches and its Casino, the Princess sits in her palace, gazing at the luxurious hotels and rivieras. To some, a speck on the European map, an oversight of history; to others, a wonderland of excess and refined hedonism; to the Princess, Monaco will always be a cage, no matter how gilded."

POLITICS_Leonida_Suzzi_Valli_DESC:0 "His Excellence Leonida Suzzi Valli is the newly elected Captain Regent of the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, the tiny republic nested on the Monte Titano, in the Apennine mountains. A mathematics and physics high school teacher by trade, Valli also later became involved in the political life of the Republic, pursuing a diplomatic career and becoming the envoy of San Marino to Italy and Germany during WWII. Despite resenting fascism and its negative effects on the once free and democratic life of his small nation, Valli was forced into joining the Partito Fascista Sammarinese in order to continue his political career.\n\nAfter WWII, Valli continued his political activity, despite the country being dominated by the fascists and the powerful Gozi family, which placed its members in the position of Captain Regent multiple times. Over the years, Valli became the most prominent members of the opposition against the Gozi, finally managing to become Captain Regent with the goal of reverting the undemocratic and illiberal policies of the past and restore a semblance of freedom to the ancient Republic.\n\nDespite having its ancient tradition of democracy tarnished by the stain of fascism, San Marino developed greatly in the last few decades, and new troubles afflict the old republic. With industrialization and urbanization increasing ever faster, the economy of the country depends more and more from Italy, chipping away at San Marino's prized independence, and the workers and proles are becoming more and more resentful towards the institutions of the Republic. Now, Valli and his allies have to navigate this tangled web of problems ensnaring the Monte Titano, being careful not to draw too much unwanted attention from their Italian neighbors."

### Monaco ###
MOC_casino_monte_carlo:0 "Casino de Monte Carlo"
MOC_casino_monte_carlo_desc:0 "The Monte Carlo Casino is what Monaco is mostly well known for, attracting rich foreigners from all over the world seeking to gamble their fortunes away in its luxurious halls. The glamour and elegance of the Casino is not just for show however: it plays a fundamental role in the finances of our small state. However, since the end of WW2, the casino's traditional clientele, the European aristocracy, largely found itself impoverished, exiled, or dead, causing serious economic trouble to our Principality. If we don't find an alternative source of revenue, the glamour and hedonism associated with Monaco might soon become a distant memory as we find ourselves broke."

MOC_rainier_reform:0 "Rainier's Reformism"
MOC_rainier_reform_desc:0 "The current heir to the throne, prince Rainier III, is arguably more famous abroad and at home than his mother, the reigning princess. To the international tabloids, he's known for his marriage to American film star Grace Kelly, and to the international diplomats, he's known for his open sympathizing of the Allied cause during WW2, which almost cost Monaco its very existence as Axis troops occupied the small principality. Nevertheless, Rainier is still very politically active today: while his mother is mostly preoccupied with her affairs, Rainier manages the country to a significant degree, to the point of forming a clique of ministers and bureaucrats that are very influential in the country's government."

MOC_italian_oversight:0 "Italian Oversight"
MOC_italian_oversight_desc:0 "The very fact that our country still exists is a small miracle: successively occupied by both German and Italian troops during WW2, Monaco only managed to save itself because of her economic value to the Axis invaders. With its casino functioning as a steady source of valuable foreign currency, Monaco continued existing as a de jure independent state, later falling firmly in the Italian sphere of influence. However, Rome has not shown a light hand in governing the affairs of Monaco, and every move that may decrease the principality's dependency from Italy is looked upon with suspicion by the fascist government. Should we be too careless in our attempts to raise the fortunes of our country, the consequences might be dire indeed."

### San Marino ###
SNM_princely_sovereign_council:0 "The Princely and Sovereign Council"
SNM_princely_sovereign_council_desc:0 "San Marino, the most ancient republic in the world, has a long tradition of democracy and freedom. Or rather, it used to have: ever since 1923, the Partito Fascista Sammarinese has dominated the political life of the small country, with all opposition declared illegal, and the ancient Grand and General Council turned into its current incarnation, the Princely and Sovereign Council. While this was partially done to appease Italy, this also enshrined the power of the wealthy families like the Gozi, who formed the original core of the party, who have been firmly in control of the republic for forty years. While internal opposition has been mounting, it seems unlikely that the PFS will be ousted from power any time soon."

SNM_burgeoning_indust:0 "Burgeoning Industrialization"
SNM_burgeoning_indust_desc:0 "Since the times of Mussolini, Italy and San Marino began to work on a series of coordinated infrastructural works such as the railway connecting San Marino to Rimini. This had the effect of increasing our economic dependency on Italy, but also also of shifting our historical agrarian economy into a process of strong industrial development. As more and more countryside villagers flock to the developing industrial towns to take up jobs in the factories, the traditional fabric of Sammarinese society, once dominated by the landowning elite, is also shifting, with the urban masses becoming ever more important to the political equilibrium of the country."

SNM_rising_discontent:0 "Rising Discontent"
SNM_rising_discontent_desc:0 "Despite the recent industrial development, economic inequality is still a serious problem in the Republic. This, combined with the curtailing of labour rights by the fascist administration and the dominance of the PFS reducing political freedoms, is causing a serious wave of discontent among the working and lower classes. While our law enforcement is still keeping things under control for now, we have reason to suspect that the clandestine Partito Comunista Sammarinese is exploiting the situation to spread its seditious doctrine among the proles. Unless we deal with the situation, we might have trouble down the line."

### Vatican ###
VAC_lateran_pacts:0 "The Lateran Pacts"
VAC_lateran_pacts_desc:0 "Signed in 1929 by Benito Mussolini and the Holy See, the Lateran Pacts are the legal and diplomatic basis for the existence of the Vatican City State. Ending almost 60 years of animosity between the Papacy and the Italian state, which began with Italy's seizure of Rome during the Risorgimento, the Lateran Pacts not only restored a proper Papal State (albeit limited to the sole Vatican), but also gave other concessions to the Church such as state financing, recognition of Catholicism as the Italian state religion, and allowing the Church to maintain teaching of Catholic doctrine in public schools. As long as the Lateran Pacts are still in force, we can rest assured that our country suffers no threat under Italy's protective wing."

VAC_one_holy_catholic:0 "One, Holy, Catholic, Divided Church"
VAC_one_holy_catholic_desc:0 "Being the largest religious organization in the world and the spiritual home of millions of Catholics, it is only natural that, despite its divine unity, the Church suffers from some very human division. Faced with the challenges of a changing world, the Church is divided on what is to be done to preserve its role as the worldly house of Christ: to continue working with the numerous oppressive and tyrannical regimes of the world as long as they pay lip service to Christian doctrine, ignoring their violent excesses? To instead take a stance against the brutality of fascism and imperialism, and to truly help the poor and the meek? Or to distance from worldly politics altogether, only tending to the souls of the Catholic flock? These and more questions divide the Church, and God only knows how they will be resolved."

VAC_good_pope:0 "The Good Pope"
VAC_good_pope_desc:0 "After the controversial papacy of Pius XII, the election of John XXIII marked a significant shift in the politics of the Holy See. Where Pius XII was austere, solemn and distant, John XXIII has always been perceived as close to the common man, preaching to the masses, revitalizing the activity of lay Catholic political associations, and criticizing the oppression of the fascist regimes of Europe and beyond. The far reaching popularity of pope Roncalli earned him the nickname of "il Papa buono" in Italy and beyond, and the suspicion of several governments the world over. However, with his health ailing, the Good Pope knows he only has a limited time to guide the Church in the direction he wishes it to take, before God recalls him by His side."
