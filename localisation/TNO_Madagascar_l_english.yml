Instead, it has become the principal repository of the Reich's racial pariahs; All those men who in spite of their insufficiently aryan ancestry, could not be themselves consigned to one of the island's ghettoes due to political reasons. Moreover, once the slavery system was legalized during the 1950s, and those european jews who had not been deported became enslaved, Madagaskar's raison d'etre - and its funding - disappeared. Unsurprisingly, placing anxious exiled functionaries in a low budget environment made any pretense of carrying out the §BMadagaskarplan§! laughable. Thus, the Reichskommissariat has slowly degraded into a hemorrhoid at the bottom end of the Reich, as more and more concessions were made to the native and jewish populations by the bickering factions of the §GGeneralbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten (GMA)§!, in futile attempts to gain the upper hand.\n\nToday, Madagaskar is a major embarrassment to Germany, in which the SS is a front for §YMalagasy nationalism§!, §MJudeo-Bolshevik militias§! hold effective control of ghettos, and the §SWehrmacht§! plots against its own government. Moreover, the colony's hinterland is a ticking time bomb, with the first cases of a §gfamiliar disease§! being reported. However, these embarrassments pale in comparison to the fact that, like the other German African Reichkomissariats, Madagascar is not but the personification of its leader.\n\nPossessing the apathy of §YWolfgang Schenk§!, the administrative skill of §YSiegfried Müller§!, and the liveliness of §YHans Hüttig§!, the 1/16th Jewish §LEmil Maurice§! is the single greatest cause of Magadaskar's degenerate practices. That is, at any rate, what Hüttig, scornfully looking across the Mozambique channel, actually believes. Those still living in reality, however, are acutely aware that Maurice has never attended a GMA cabinet meeting, or exercises any power in the colony whatsoever. The fiction of Reichkommissariat's existence is kept alive only by a dedicated clique of junior bureaucrats, led by §jWilhelm Stoph§!, and permanently undermined by Generalfeldmarschall §SErhard Milch§!. Nevertheless, there is something to be said about Maurice's perpetually depressed attitude affecting the state of the colony, as noted by the fact that his uncharacteristically active participation in §Ydiplomatic talks§! about the §Tlifting of the OFN embargo§! on the island has led to unexpected success..."

 MAD_the_red_island:0 "붉은 섬"
 MAD_the_red_island_desc:0 "Madagaskar would to many seem to be the strangest place in the Reich, at least if anyone in the Reich paid attention to it. Reichskommissar Maurice is a man sitting in a very precarious position, between allegiance to Germany, and allegiance to the CIA. Meanwhile, the Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten is in actuality the organ that manages the Island, with very, very little to no oversight from the Reichskommissar.\n\nAt the same time, Malagasy rebels are giving both the garrison and the GMA constant headaches with crimes done with weapons they shouldn't have. The significant minority of Jews in the north, which the Reichskommissariat was constructed to contain, have also been a major issue, as they continue strikes on the central government. The garrison itself is a militarist hive of men who believe the Reichskommissar is corrupt.\n\nThe Red Island is unstable, but for now, we should be able to keep it under control, unless something throws a wrench in the proceedings."

 MAD_benefits_of_a_lifted_blockade_desc:0 "After the war, the United States of America enacted a mass embargo on German goods, leading to the US establishing a naval blockade on goods entering Reichskommissariat Madagaskar. For many years now, weapons and construction materials have been especially limited. Food has been heavily rationed, and more and more unrest grew as we simply couldn't do anything to stop the rebels.\n\nNow the blockade has been lifted, we can at last be free of the limitations put upon us. We have the opportunity to cancel rationing, to work on our extensive infrastructure projects, to build unbelievable things! However, rumours have been travelling that it's Reichskommissar Maurice's supposed connections to the CIA that has caused the blockade to be brought down. While the rumours surrounding the Reichskommissar's connections are entirely true, it is unknown whether he brought down the blockade."

Giant buildings to mark that the Reich can bring light to the darkest corners of the Earth! Bridges, railways, oh my! However, as the blockade came up and the materials reduced, the plans became less and less ambitious.\n\nNow that the blockade is down, we have plans to build some relatively small buildings in Toliara, as well as a single rail line connecting Toliara and Antananarivo. The Toliara Projects are not what they used to be, to be sure, but they certainly make clear the nature of the reich. While we cannot bring light to a place as dark and miserable as Reichskommissariat Madagaskar, we can hopefully build a couple of buildings."

Everything from fishing zones to infrastructure reform is under the purview of the GMA, rather than the reichskommissar.\n\nThe Reichskommissar as of late has been talking to the American government, something that the GMA picked up on very quickly. While the GMA is in a stable position, if the secret gets out beyond basic rumours the GMA is going to be in serious trouble, as will the island of Madagascar itself.

Every day, another brave soldier is shot by a bullet from the forest, another life is taken by a rebel, whether by a Jew or a Malagasy warrior. The central issue surrounding this is that the garrison is already limited and overstretched, and now that the blockade has fallen, we must do everything we can to protect our infrastructure projects. So one by one.\n\nFirst, the Jews. The grand "Madagascar Plan" was created by Franz Rademacher, the minister for Jewish affairs in the foreign policy office in 1940. The plan was simple. Ship Jews to Madagascar, and see them suffer and die of starvation and disease from the strange flora and fauna of the island. But strangely, they prospered in the new climate, and have been haunting the Madagaskar garrison and government ever since.\n\nThen, the Malagasy. To claim that the GMA wasn't expecting resistance from the natives of the island would be an understatement. Everything has been tried, and everything has failed. Infiltrators, assaults on bases, daily patrols. We don't even know where they get their weapons.\n\nWe will do what we can to handle both of these threats. We can only hope something won't go wrong."

Generalfeldmarschall Milch seems more occupied with discipline than actually fighting the various militia groups that dot the island, as well as having a clear dislike for Reichskommissar Emil Maurice.\n\nHe has suggested on multiple occasions to allow his garrison more autonomy, and to allow him the opportunity to operate without too much GMA oversight. While many have doubts that this shall make the government more effective in handling threats, many are supportive of this idea, thinking that at the very least Milch would stop opposing Maurice at every step of the way."

Each day he marches through the jungles searching for rebels to hunt and kill, and often he brings someone back. But usually, he comes back empty handed, lost in frustration. No matter how much he tries to serve the Reich, it has never dealt him a good hand, and time after time he has fallen in stature and grace.\n\nHowever, he leads the garrison on Madagaskar, and thus, we must work with him in order to get some damn stability on this godforsaken island. He'll be talking to us, and to the Reichskommissar on the subject of military strategies. There's talk that he knows that Maurice is in contact with the Americans, but we can be almost entirely positive that he has no interest in betraying Maurice."

However, many have criticised this idea, and even the Reichskommissar protested himself. He believes that a naval force for Madagaskar could easily be seized by some opponent, but the reichskommissar is simply delusional in our eyes. We'll be perfectly fine."

Fear can spread even faster than the disease, and soon the people who are not ill will be more concerned with keeping the plague away than anything else.\n\nIf we do not act quickly and decisively, things will spiral out of control.

The spread of the disease has slowed, but not stopped, and it is only a matter of time before we start to lose control again. Worse, our stocks of medical supplies are running low, and we lack the resources to replenish them on our own. One option available to us is to contact the Reich proper and ask for aid. Surely the Reich will not abandon a loyal Reichskommissariat.

The best way to do that is with strict, sweeping quarantines. We will enforce these quarantines on areas of the island that have seen significant infection, preventing anyone from entering or leaving without a valid medical purpose or explicit special permission. The garrison will be deployed to patrol the roads in quarantine areas, and they will be authorized to use whatever force they see fit to enforce our orders."

 MAD_the_ghetto_problem_desc:0 "The Jewish Ghettos are densely packed breeding grounds for plague. A starved and weak population kept in a prison of crude, unmaintained homes surrounded by military checkpoints. They live in their own filth and are neglected by the administration, many within said administration would see it as a positive that they live this way, see their susceptibility to illnesses as simply another boon of putting them in the Ghettos. But the truth is if they are contaminated, so too would the soldiers be, then their families and friends, then their communities, and so on. This turns the Ghettos into a ticking time bomb, a vestige for plague with the possibility of a single interaction resulting in death reaching far beyond their inhabitants."

With the limited number of medically trained people on the isle, we find ourselves in a precarious position with far too few doctors to treat our ill. Patients stack up as backlogs form, and then slowly dwindle as they perish awaiting their salvation. Not to mention the risk of our currently limited staff being compromised as they work so closely with patients and the Plague. Due to this ordeal, the G.M.A has deemed it necessary to reach out to our neighboring Reichskommissariats and the Reich itself to request relief and assistance in the form of medical professionals."

 MAD_we_need_everything_desc:0 "Despite all of the assistance we have requested it is becoming increasingly clear that we lack the necessary supplies to sustain ourselves against the plague any longer. Medical supplies are consumed far faster than we can attain or produce them, and the resulting shortages lead to further death and decay. In an attempt to reduce our deficit, it has been proposed that we should turn less prudent production facilities towards the production of medical supplies. Chief among these being armament production facilities, which are currently far less vital for the survival of the Reichskommissariat, thus an emergency order will be issued to our arms factories requisitioning emergency production of medical supplies."

As the American blockade remains in force for medical supplies, this leaves us with only one option: Plead to Hüttig for help.\n\nGiven the Ostafrikan Reichkommissar's well-publicized distaste for the way in which our realm is administered, aid is unlikely to be forthcoming, but we have no choice. By framing our request for help as being in the interest of "continued German rule of Africa," we may just be able to short circuit Hüttig's tiny SS mind to send us the aid we need in order to survive."

 MAD_deploy_the_planes_desc:0 "Hüttig has responded to our requests for assistance with quite the suggestion: deploying a large number of planes in order to spread pesticides across the land, with the goal of greatly reducing the rat population on our isle. Rats, serving as one of the main vectors for transmission of the plague to Humans, pose a significant threat to our people in this time of crisis. Cutting the rat population on our isle to near extinction would do wonders for limiting the spread of the plague, however many have called this plan crude in its conception and brutal in its goal. While the officials squabble over the ethics, we've already begun to execute the plan. After all, if the scientists had a better plan, they'd have already given it to us."

Specifically, his suggestion demands that we raze heavily contaminated villages. Methods akin to this have been perfected and used throughout Ostafrika, and he believes they could be effective in dealing with the plague on our isle as well. While some have again raised issue with the brutality of this plan and the destruction it could invoke on the very land we govern, most view it as a necessary sacrifice to prevent the spread of plague. Besides, most of them would die of plague if we left them alone, and we certainly can't spare the resources to treat them. With the approval of the G.M.A the operation is to be carried out and the heavily contaminated villages reduced to ash."

We must stem this tide now, for we have already allowed it to run free for far too long. If there are no infected left to spread the plague and no living left for the plague to inhabit, it will die out with them.

There was much speculation among the crews in the following days about the sudden shift in policy. One popular theory was that rising tensions in mainland Africa were the culprit, either causing the American government to back down or to consolidate strength elsewhere. Others suggested that they were just too expensive. A few even had wild theories about secret deals between the Reichskommissar and the United States.

From time to time, a Malagasy rebel shoots a soldier, or there is a drunken brawl, but little else is heard from within the dirty, badly kept hospitals. Recently, however, we've been getting reports that they've been under heavy stress as of late, as dozens of people have begun storming the hospitals, all seriously ill.\n\nOur largest issue here is that our hospitals are simply unprepared to handle such a serious load, and are overstretched. Considering our stocks of medical aid is remarkably limited, we simply don't have enough resources to manage a storming of this scale. It is unknown what is causing the rush, but the patients appear to be suffering from cases of the black plague. Hopefully, the outbreak shouldn't spread, although we can only really hope. However, the G.M.A. seems relatively hopeful, and believes that Madagaskar shall prove it's place in the reich once and for all. After all, small scale epidemics happen quite often."

Instead, they found entire villages had come down with the plague, and those few that were not yet contaminated were attempting to isolate themselves and often tried to turn away the investigative teams for fear of infection, sometimes violently. It was not clear how far, exactly, the plague had spread on the island. What was clear was that where it had spread, it had spread quickly and completely, devastating local communities.

The Reichskommissar would not address them after this, repeating his statement that what they wanted could not be and waiting for their inevitable departure.\n\nSchulz was not closely involved in the running of the island, of course, but for such a high-level position there was little to do. Maurice rarely asked him to deliver messages or schedule meetings, content to let him answer the phone and allow visitors. The indifference of the Reichskommissar had bothered him for some time, but it didn't matter. There was almost no communication going in and out of the island, and officials were talking to Maurice less and less.\n\nToday, somebody whose name Schulz actually remembered had stormed in with a cadre of officers, demanding to see the Reichskommissar- General Milch, the garrison commander. Ranting and raving about the incompetence of the administration in Toamasina, threatening to have Schulz shot when informed the Reichskommissar was busy, and barging into the office anyway.\n\nMilch received the same treatment as anyone else.

Similar conversations were taking place all across the island, at every rank and every station. Were the hospitals effective? It did not matter to the soldiers, who cared little for the people who were coming in. What mattered was the perceived danger to them and the supplies, space, and time that had been "stolen" for this "scheme". In truth, the "scheme" was working quite well. Many who would have gone untreated or been treated by some dangerous amateur were now in proper hospitals, receiving proper care.\n\nStill, it was not enough. Working well was not enough.

Taking his place on the uncomfortable seat, Moorer addresses the Reichskommissar in broken German:\n\n"Herr Kommissar, I have been authorized to discuss terms for an OFN administration of Madagascar." The admiral waved a brown paper folio, soaked by the rain, at the German governor. "You should note our special attention to the treatment of German personnel in the island..." To his surprise, Maurice reacted dismissively, "You may do as you please with this jew-infested hellhole, Admiral, but you must get me out of it."\n\nMoorer took a few seconds to wrap his brain around Emil Maurice's demands, using his memory of the document to break the resulting silence. "In that case, annex C details the forces which the OFN would be willing to commit to securing the island and the means by which your excellency's evacuation could be secured." Now, the entire demeanor of the man changed, and his attention span exponentially increased.\n\n"... This is most impressive, Admiral. Especially the bit about the helicopter."

The garrison was full of people more loyal to Milch than to Maurice or even the Reich, and needed a thorough investigation to bring it back under control.

In spite of having long since fallen out of favor with the SS, Maurice still tried to keep some semblance of the spartanism his former organization advocated for. Practical luxuries were, however, a different thing. In particular, Maurice had lately endeavored to obtain the latest communications equipment from the Reich, including the island's only automatic exchange telephone.\n\nAs the Reich took Maurice's post as seriously as he did, no call from Germania ever came through Maurice's phone. However, Maurice kept it, since the fact it didn't need a switchboard meant that no intrusive operator would hear his call. As he looked at a memorandum warning him of the sorry state of his loyalist's equipment, and the threat possessed by garrisons loyal to Milch, he sighed. However, in a rare act for Maurice, he did not despair, and instead picked up his shiny red phone, dialing in the number he'd been told to memorize from the brown folio.\n\nOn the other side of the tube, a femmine voice answered courteously in English. Hitler's driver had a hard time remembering the correct words, "I will speak with Admiral Moorer." The borderline cartoonish accent and the brashness of his words would have made the secretary cut off the prankster if not for Admiral Moorer having overheard the Reichkommisar's voice.

Oh, and the navy can probably give you some intelligence of intercepted communications."

A former military household requisitioned when its occupant deserted to Milch's forces, the french-looking building was bustling with panicking staffers still loyal to Maurice, who could only ponder the reverberating radio bulletins proudly announcing the list of GMA civil servants facing a firing squad at the former capital. The compound stank, courtesy of the gunpowder used to shoot suspected plague victims at the nearby field hospital, a smell complimented only by that of burning paper - the colony's classified documents - but Maurice could hardly take note of the stench.\n\nAmidst all this, the Reichskommissar was chiefly concerned with finding the telephone landline which military maps indicated was somewhere nearby. He had made sure that Stoph was engaged in the futile task of reorganizing the irredeemably stupid who refused to desert into a force capable of delaying the enemy. With the chief engineer of the colony - an SS sergeant - nonthewiser to his objectives, Maurice ordered him to hook up the telephone he had hurriedly salvaged from his Toamasina office, and then dismissed the man. Once he was gone, the man who had once been Adolf Hitler's best friend pulled out the brown folio given to him by Admiral Moorer.

 MADAGASKAR_MAURICE.15.desc:0 "Emil Maurice had never really worried about anything in all his tormentous years as Reichkommissar of Madagascar. Today, however, he panicked.\n\nIt had been a few days since he sent out his plea for help. There was no way the Americans had missed it. Nevertheless, the Reichskommissar insisted on deluding himself - perhaps, he thought, the Americans were keeping radio silence for an outright occupation of the island. As more and more hours passed, and the hours turned into days, and the days into weeks, Maurice has become increasingly unhinged. Every backfiring motorcycle is an enemy assassin, every deserter is a Milch fifth columnist. If Maurice had any authority left, his little corner of Madagaskar would look much like an army commanded by General Schroner.\n\nAll that Maurice can do now is to stand up for himself, and fight."

In front of him, a scrawny man with grey hair and a copy of Mein Kampf stood, desperate not to get shot, but not so much as to raise his hands, for he knew that he would live.\n\n"Calm down you moron, we are here for him." Lundstrom's superior officer, much to his own disappointment, had to stop any notion of shooting the man with the swastika armband and SS uniform. "Mr. uh - Maurice? Its time to go now." For the first time in years, Maurice was giddy with excitement, as he gleefully helped himself to the American's PT boat, which took him to the battleship USS Iowa, anchored just a few miles away.\n\nAs the Iowa sailed back to the OFN base at Christmas island, Lundstrom was put on guard duty at the signals compartment. Soon after he got there, the sailor in charge of the decryptor handed him over a piece of paper, "get it to Captain Becton, will you." Having nothing better to do, Lundstrom got on his merry way, stopping along the junction between the officer's mess hall and the bridge.

Although they saluted him, the mistmaching uniforms and probably dysfunctional guns they showed off while guarding the two columns on the entrance to the building made them almost a parody of military discipline. It was only after he went in that he realized one of them had a French Adrian helmet instead of a german model. Stoph shook his head. "Can't get any worse than this."\n\nHowever, Stoph soon found out he was wrong. Walking into the meeting, he found the GMA council in an absolute panic. "Wilhem, where the fuck have you been?" Horst von Oppenfeld's voice traveled across the room and hit Stoph quite suddenly. After composing himself, Stoph responded with the obvious, "Maurice sent me to organize the army, Horst. Didn't he tell you?" The assembled leadership of the colony looked at him as if he'd claimed martian ancestry. "Maurice is gone, he's vanished." A cold sweat struck Stoph at that moment. If they couldn't offer the Reichskommissar's head to the rebels, their ass would be on the line.\n\nNo sooner had Stoph joined the bickering GMA colleagues in discussion what to do, than the conscript with the Adrian helmet rushed in, handed over a note, and left. Von Oppenfeld had to read it outloud to believe it.\n\n"This is Admiral Moorer of the OFN's Indian Ocean Command. Reichskommissar Maurice is under our protection.

There was only one hope left for him now.\n\nShortly before, Maurice had sent a message to the Americans. He begged them, pleaded that they should send a helicopter to extract him. He'd been loyal to them, betraying Germany and offering the whole island for the chance to get off this miserable rock. The response on the other end had been horrifyingly ambiguous, and Maurice was left unsure of whether they were coming.\n\nThe sounds of battle got closer and closer to the palace. The army was nearly gone. It would be down to the palace guard, then, and they were brave and had an excellent defensive position, but even greater disadvantages in terms of number and firepower. They would have to get out of the palace and to the landing zone once they knew the helicopter was coming. If it was coming. They were taking a long time.

When he looked forward again, Maurice saw the helicopter taking off. They were too late the whole time.\n\n"Fuck it." Johnson was pissed. They had flown through a whole sky of shit, coming out for some Nazi fuck, and he doesn't even show up? Fuck this. "We're getting out of here before we get killed. He's not coming.
