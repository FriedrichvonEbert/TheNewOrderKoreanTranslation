 COUNTRY_INFO_MADAGASKAR:0 "§G==REICHSKOMMISSARIAT MADAGASKAR==§!\n\nLast amongst equals in Germany's african territories is the §GReichskommisariat of Madagaskar§!. Originally intended to house the jewish population of Europe, the Reichskommissariat was supposed to be a tightly controlled, efficient, island-wide ghetto by means of which Germany could put the jewish question to rest. Instead, it has become the principal repository of the Reich's racial pariahs; All those men who in spite of their insufficiently aryan ancestry, could not be themselves consigned to one of the island's ghettoes due to political reasons. Moreover, once the slavery system was legalized during the 1950s, and those european jews who had not been deported became enslaved, Madagaskar's raison d'etre - and its funding - disappeared. Unsurprisingly, placing anxious exiled functionaries in a low budget environment made any pretense of carrying out the §BMadagaskarplan§! laughable. Thus, the Reichskommissariat has slowly degraded into a hemorrhoid at the bottom end of the Reich, as more and more concessions were made to the native and jewish populations by the bickering factions of the §GGeneralbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten (GMA)§!, in futile attempts to gain the upper hand.\n\nToday, Madagaskar is a major embarrassment to Germany, in which the SS is a front for §YMalagasy nationalism§!, §MJudeo-Bolshevik militias§! hold effective control of ghettos, and the §SWehrmacht§! plots against its own government. Moreover, the colony's hinterland is a ticking time bomb, with the first cases of a §gfamiliar disease§! being reported. However, these embarrassments pale in comparison to the fact that, like the other German African Reichkomissariats, Madagascar is not but the personification of its leader.\n\nPossessing the apathy of §YWolfgang Schenk§!, the administrative skill of §YSiegfried Müller§!, and the liveliness of §YHans Hüttig§!, the 1/16th Jewish §LEmil Maurice§! is the single greatest cause of Magadaskar's degenerate practices. That is, at any rate, what Huttig, scornfully looking across the Mozambique channel, actually believes. Those still living in reality, however, are acutely aware that Maurice has never attended a GMA cabinet meeting, or exercises any power in the colony whatsoever. The fiction of Reichkommissariat's existence is kept alive only by a dedicated clique of junior bureaucrats, led by §jWilhelm Stoph§!, and permanently undermined by Generalfeldmarschall §SErhard Milch§!. Nevertheless, there is something to be said about Maurice's perpetually depressed attitude affecting the state of the colony, as noted by the fact that his uncharacteristically active participation in §Ydiplomatic talks§! about the §Tlifting of the OFN embargo§! on the island has led to unexpected success..."
 POLITICS_GABRIEL_RAMANANTSOA_DESC:0 "Men like Gabriel Ramanantsoa can be found all over Germany's empire: Decent, patriotic, and old enough to have seen their countries pass from one colonial overlord to another. Like many of his counterparts in the Reich's other possessions, Ramanantsoa endeavored to make his homeland's suffering the least worst possible by collaborating. He did this exceptionally well, and rapidly gained command of the native-SS in the colony.\n\nFrom his post, Ramanantsoa was keen to appreciate just how strong the native's position in the colony really was. After the first meeting with the Reichkommisar, it became clear to him that Emil Maurice was so totally disinterested in the management of the colony, and that Erhard Milch was so powerless over the SS, that he could turn the entire organization into a front for Malagasy liberation. He spent the subsequent years doing exactly that, slowly creating a parallel government to the increasingly powerless office of the Reichskommissar, coming to terms with Bar-Lev's Hitnagdut movement, and eliminating rivals for the leadership of the malagasy independence movement. By 1962, the stage was set for him to launch an uprising and depose Maurice. To Ramanantsoa dismay, he was beaten to this by Erhard Milch, and had to launch a hasty revolution in the hinterland in order to prevent his entire plan from falling apart. \n\nBearing Madagascar's national symbols over the torn schutzstaffel insignias in his uniform, Ramanantsoa has now become the undisputed poster child of Malagasy liberation. Nevertheless, he must prove himself worthy of the rank by defeating the german military machine on the island, and so free his nation from the cycle of exploitation and poverty, which seventy years of colonial rule have made her a victim of. If he succeeds, Ramanantsoa knows he will be immortalized as the savior of his people, securing what he most wants most: A place in history."
 POLITICS_HAIM_BAR_LEV_DESC:0 "Rising above the squalid african ghettos to which the last survivors of European jewry were confined to during the 1940s, Haïm Bar-Lev seeks not just to win against the hated nazis, but to remain morally superior to them once the smoke of battle clears.\n\nLike many in the Hitnagdut movement, Bar-Lev's life of resistance began shortly after the creation of the Reichskommissariat, when the power struggle between Maurice and his generals became the German's main preoccupation. An important consequence of infighting amongst the Germans is that the original aim of the colony: Implementing the Madagaskar Plan, was rapidly forgotten. By the grace of this blissful ignorance, the jewish community was free to begin having major infighting of their own, which continued to hamper their efforts to organize any sort of resistance. Bar-Lev, representing the most moderate wing of the nascent Hitnagdut organization, stepped in to calm his exiled compatriots down, and rapidly gained respect for his ability to compromise the disparate factions that make up the movement.\n\nAfter achieving leadership of the Hitnagdut, Bar-Lev spent the late 1950s in excruciatingly long negotiations with the native maalgasy to reach a truce between the two anti-German factions, which Ramanantsoa's ascent facilitated. Since then, he has been laying out plans for a military uprising to overthrow Maurice, but events proved to move quicker than he expected, and like everyone on the island, he must now fight on Milch's terms.\n\nAlthough Bar-Lev has had to do many things throughout his stay in Madagaskar in order to succeed, there is one common thread amongst all of them: A sense of moral purpose, of trying to be better than the Germans. The jewish leader is concerned that if he lowers his people down to the level of the Nazis, then any military victory will have been pyrrhic."
 POLITICS_ERHARD_MILCH_DESC:0 "For a man whose most distinguishing feature is a burning hatred for Emil Maurice, Erhard Milch sure has a lot in common with the object of his derision.\n\nThe supreme commander of German forces in Madagaskar was once the rising star of the Luftwaffe, and a close friend of Hermann Goering. For some, he was the obvious successor to the Reichsmarschall at the air force, but all this changed with the economic crash of the 50s. Milch's less-than-aryan ancestry had always been a source of attacks on the Field Marshall, and with the NSDAP in dire need of scapegoats, the partially jewish Milch was, like Maurice, speedily exiled to Madagaskar. Not unlike the Reichskommissar, it was the intervention of Goering which spared Milch from being inside of the island's ghettoes. Here, however, the similarities with Maurice end, for in stark contrast to his immediate superior, Milch sees his posting a temporary setback, in which hard work will win him a return ticket to Germania.\n\nInitially, he planned to do this by cooperating with Maurice in overseeing the implementation of Madagaskar plan, which was his official duty. He reasoned that the Reichkommisar, being as desperate as him to return home, would be inclined to do this same. This idea was nevertheless rapidly abandoned when it became clear that Maurice had no intention of actually fulfilling his duties, and was in any case too difficult a man to work with. Following this, Milch turned his full attention to exposing conspiracy theories surrounding the Reichskommissar, and eventually to plot his overthrow. Now that he has convinced enough of his fellow Wehrmacht officers that Maurice is plotting against the Reich, all he has to do is to wrest control of the island from his many enemies. Once he does, he is confident the Reich will welcome him back as the man who saved Madagaskar."


 MAD_the_red_island:0 "The Red Island"
 MAD_the_red_island_desc:0 "Madagaskar would to many seem to be the strangest place in the Reich, at least if anyone in the Reich paid attention to it. Reichskommissar Maurice is a man sitting in a very precarious position, between allegiance to Germany, and allegiance to the CIA. Meanwhile, the Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten is in actuality the organ that manages the Island, with very, very little to no oversight from the Reichskommissar.\n\nAt the same time, Malagasy rebels are giving both the garrison and the GMA constant headaches with crimes done with weapons they shouldn't have. The significant minority of Jews in the north, which the Reichskommissariat was constructed to contain, have also been a major issue, as they continue strikes on the central government. The garrison itself is a militarist hive of men who believe the Reichskommissar is corrupt.\n\nThe Red Island is unstable, but for now, we should be able to keep it under control, unless something throws a wrench in the proceedings."
 MAD_benefits_of_a_lifted_blockade:0 "The Benefits of a Lifted Blockade"
 MAD_benefits_of_a_lifted_blockade_desc:0 "After the war, the United States of America enacted a mass embargo on German goods, leading to the US establishing a naval blockade on goods entering Reichskommissariat Madagaskar. For many years now, weapons and construction materials have been especially limited. Food has been heavily rationed, and more and more unrest grew as we simply couldn't do anything to stop the rebels.\n\nNow the blockade has been lifted, we can at last be free of the limitations put upon us. We have the opportunity to cancel rationing, to work on our extensive infrastructure projects, to build unbelievable things! However, rumours have been travelling that it's Reichskommissar Maurice's supposed connections to the CIA that has caused the blockade to be brought down. While the rumours surrounding the Reichskommissar's connections are entirely true, it is unknown whether he brought down the blockade."
 MAD_toliara_projects:0 "Finish the Toliara Projects"
 MAD_toliara_projects_desc:0 "Hans Henselmann was always a man with a plan. He had constructed wide economic reforms for Madagaskar in the early 50s, along with a giant project known as the Toliara Projects. Giant buildings to mark that the Reich can bring light to the darkest corners of the Earth! Bridges, railways, oh my! However, as the blockade came up and the materials reduced, the plans became less and less ambitious.\n\nNow that the blockade is down, we have plans to build some relatively small buildings in Toliara, as well as a single rail line connecting Toliara and Antananarivo. The Toliara Projects are not what they used to be, to be sure, but they certainly make clear the nature of the reich. While we cannot bring light to a place as dark and miserable as Reichskommissariat Madagaskar, we can hopefully build a couple of buildings."
 MAD_trust_the_gma:0 "Trust the G.M.A."
 MAD_trust_the_gma_desc:0"It is well known among many at this point that Reichskommissar Emil Maurice is not the true controller of affairs in Madagaskar. Instead, that title goes to the Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten, or the GMA. The GMA control everything on the island with substantially little oversight. Everything from fishing zones to infrastructure reform is under the purview of the GMA, rather than the reichskommissar.\n\nThe Reichskommissar as of late has been talking to the American government, something that the GMA picked up on very quickly. While the GMA is in a stable position, if the secret gets out beyond basic rumours the GMA is going to be in serious trouble, as will the island of Madagascar itself. So we will keep this under wraps. After all, we can be trusted, can't we?"

 MAD_dealing_with_rebels_desc:0 "In our jungles and forests, there are stirrings. Every day, another brave soldier is shot by a bullet from the forest, another life is taken by a rebel, whether by a Jew or a Malagasy warrior. The central issue surrounding this is that the garrison is already limited and overstretched, and now that the blockade has fallen, we must do everything we can to protect our infrastructure projects. So one by one.\n\nFirst, the Jews. The grand "Madagascar Plan" was created by Franz Rademacher, the minister for Jewish affairs in the foreign policy office in 1940. The plan was simple. Ship Jews to Madagascar, and see them suffer and die of starvation and disease from the strange flora and fauna of the island. But strangely, they prospered in the new climate, and have been haunting the Madagaskar garrison and government ever since.\n\nThen, the Malagasy. To claim that the GMA wasn't expecting resistance from the natives of the island would be an understatement. Everything has been tried, and everything has failed. Infiltrators, assaults on bases, daily patrols. We don't even know where they get their weapons.\n\nWe will do what we can to handle both of these threats. We can only hope something won't go wrong."
 MAD_support_the_garrison:0 "Support the Garrison"
 MAD_support_the_garrison_desc:0 "The garrison of Madagaskar is a blunt force in the face of rebellion and tyranny, only marred by the fact that it seems in essence incompetent in stopping threats. Generalfeldmarschall Milch seems more occupied with discipline than actually fighting the various militia groups that dot the island, as well as having a clear dislike for Reichskommissar Emil Maurice.\n\nHe has suggested on multiple occasions to allow his garrison more autonomy, and to allow him the opportunity to operate without too much GMA oversight. While many have doubts that this shall make the government more effective in handling threats, many are supportive of this idea, thinking that at the very least Milch would stop opposing Maurice at every step of the way."
 MAD_coordinate_with_milch:0 "Coordinate with Erhard Milch"
 MAD_coordinate_with_milch_desc:0 "Erhard Milch, like any other man, is very uncomfortable living on Madagaskar. Despite his belief in direct and necessary discipline and loyalty to the Reich, he appears to be in a place of utter and total desperation. Each day he marches through the jungles searching for rebels to hunt and kill, and often he brings someone back. But usually, he comes back empty handed, lost in frustration. No matter how much he tries to serve the Reich, it has never dealt him a good hand, and time after time he has fallen in stature and grace.\n\nHowever, he leads the garrison on Madagaskar, and thus, we must work with him in order to get some damn stability on this godforsaken island. He'll be talking to us, and to the Reichskommissar on the subject of military strategies. There's talk that he knows that Maurice is in contact with the Americans, but we can be almost entirely positive that he has no interest in betraying Maurice."
 MAD_wir_lagen_vor_madagaskar:0 "Wir Lagen vor Madagaskar"
 MAD_wir_lagen_vor_madagaskar_desc:0 "Before the blockade went up, we were granted five or six disprit german ships. These hardy ships patrolled the waters of Madagaskar, at least until they were forced onto ground by the American Blockade. Over the years, they have been sitting without attention in warehouses in Toliara, without love given to them.\n\nIt's time we get them loaded out back onto the water, so that they can sail the waves in tandem once more. However, many have criticised this idea, and even the Reichskommissar protested himself. He believes that a naval force for Madagaskar could easily be seized by some opponent, but the reichskommissar is simply delusional in our eyes. We'll be perfectly fine."

The ill are unable to work, and many attempts at treatment without proper equipment and training only succeed in infecting those who would help the sick. Fear can spread even faster than the disease, and soon the people who are not ill will be more concerned with keeping the plague away than anything else.\n\nIf we do not act quickly and decisively, things will spiral out of control. Using military hospitals to help treat civilians may be unpopular with the garrison, but it will certainly help."

Worse, our stocks of medical supplies are running low, and we lack the resources to replenish them on our own. One option available to us is to contact the Reich proper and ask for aid. Surely the Reich will not abandon a loyal Reichskommissariat.

They live in their own filth and are neglected by the administration, many within said administration would see it as a positive that they live this way, see their susceptibility to     illnesses as simply another boon of putting them in the Ghettos. But the truth is if they are contaminated, so too would the soldiers be, then their families and friends, then their communities, and so on.

Not to mention the risk of our currently limited staff being compromised as they work so closely with patients and the Plague. Due to this ordeal, the G.M.A has deemed it necessary to reach out to our neighboring Reichskommissariats and the Reich itself to request relief and assistance in the form of medical professionals.

Medical supplies are consumed far faster than we can attain or produce them, and the resulting shortages lead to further death and decay. In an attempt to reduce our deficit, it has been proposed that we should turn less prudent production facilities towards the production of medical supplies. Chief among these being armament production facilities, which are currently far less vital for the survival of the Reichskommissariat, thus an emergency order will be issued to our arms factories requisitioning emergency production of medical supplies."

As the American blockade remains in force for medical supplies, this leaves us with only one option: Plead to Huttig for help.\n\nGiven the Ostafrikan Reichkommissar's well-publicized distaste for the way in which our realm is administered, aid is unlikely to be forthcoming, but we have no choice. By framing our request for help as being in the interest of "continued German rule of Africa," we may just be able to short circuit Huttig's tiny SS mind to send us the aid we need in order to survive."

Rats, serving as one of the main vectors for transmission of the plague to Humans, pose a significant threat to our people in this time of crisis.Cutting the rat population on our isle to near extinction would do wonders for limiting the spread of the plague, however many have called this plan crude in its conception and brutal in its goal. While the officials squabble over the ethics, we've already begun to execute the plan. After all, if the scientists had a better plan, they'd have already given it to us."

While some have again raised issue with the brutality of this plan and the destruction it could invoke on the very land we govern, most view it as a necessary sacrifice to prevent the spread of plague. Besides, most of them would die of plague if we left them alone, and we certainly can't spare the resources to treat them.

We must stem this tide now, for we have already allowed it to run free for far too long. If there are no infected left to spread the plague and no living left for the plague to inhabit, it will die out with them.

 MADAGASKAR.2.desc:0 "A most unusual order had come in to the American fleet blockading Madagascar. Specifically, their order was to stop blockading Madagascar. There was much speculation among the crews in the following days about the sudden shift in policy. One popular theory was that rising tensions in mainland Africa were the culprit, either causing the American government to back down or to consolidate strength elsewhere. Others suggested that they were just too expensive. A few even had wild theories about secret deals between the Reichskommissar and the United States. The only thing they all agreed on was that Madagascar would be changing quite a lot, and soon."

From time to time, a Malagasy rebel shoots a soldier, or there is a drunken brawl, but little else is heard from within the dirty, badly kept hospitals. Recently, however, we've been getting reports that they've been under heavy stress as of late, as dozens of people have begun storming the hospitals, all seriously ill.\n\nOur largest issue here is that our hospitals are simply unprepared to handle such a serious load, and are overstretched. Considering our stocks of medical aid is remarkably limited, we simply don't have enough resources to manage a storming of this scale. It is unknown what is causing the rush, but the patients appear to be suffering from cases of the black plague. Hopefully, the outbreak shouldn't spread, although we can only really hope. However, the G.M.A. seems relatively hopeful, and believes that Madagaskar shall prove it's place in the reich once and for all. After all, small scale epidemics happen quite often."

Instead, they found entire villages had come down with the plague, and those few that were not yet contaminated were attempting to isolate themselves and often tried to turn away the investigative teams for fear of infection, sometimes violently. It was not clear how far, exactly, the plague had spread on the island. What was clear was that where it had spread, it had spread quickly and completely, devastating local communities.

Becker wasn't the most creative or observant, maybe he'd overheard a similar conversation and picked it up from there or been informed by someone else.\n\n"I'm telling you, Meyer, they're screwing us on this."\n\nThe sentiment was not unusual in the garrison. Similar conversations were taking place all across the island, at every rank and every station. Were the hospitals effective? It did not matter to the soldiers, who cared little for the people who were coming in. What mattered was the perceived danger to them and the supplies, space, and time that had been "stolen" for this "scheme". In truth, the "scheme" was working quite well. Many who would have gone untreated or been treated by some dangerous amateur were now in proper hospitals, receiving proper care.\n\nStill, it was not enough. Working well was not enough.

Taking his place on the uncomfortable seat, Mooreer addresses the Reichskommissar in broken German:\n\n "Herr Kommissar, I have been authorized to discuss terms for an OFN administration of Madagascar." The admiral waved a brown paper folio, soaked by the rain, at the German governor. "You should note our special attention to the treatment of German personnel in the island..." To his surprise, Maurice reacted dismissively, "You may do as you please with this jew-infested hellhole, Admiral, but you must get me out of it."\n\n Moorer took a few seconds to wrap his brain around Emil Maurice's demands, using his memory of the document to break the resulting silence. "In that case, annex C details the forces which the OFN would be willing to commit to securing the island and the means by which your excellency's evacuation could be secured." Now, the entire demeanor of the man changed, and his attention span exponentially increased.\n\n"... This is most impressive, Admiral. Especially the bit about the helicopter."

In spite of having long since fallen out of favor with the SS, Maurice still tried to keep some semblance of the spartanism his former organization advocated for. Practical luxuries were, however, a different thing. In particular, Maurice had lately endeavored to obtain the latest communications equipment from the Reich, including the island's only automatic exchange telephone.\n\nAs the Reich took Maurice's post as seriously as he did, no call from Germania ever came through Maurice's phone. However, Maurice kept it, since the fact it didn't need a switchboard meant that no intrusive operator would hear his call. As he looked at a memorandum warning him of the sorry state of his loyalist's equipment, and the threat possessed by garrisons loyal to Milch, he sighed. However, in a rare act for Maurice, he did not despair, and instead picked up his shiny red phone, dialing in the number he'd been told to memorize from the brown folio.\n\nOn the other side of the tube, a femmine voice answered courteously in English. Hitler's driver had a hard time remembering the correct words, "I will speak with Admiral Moorer." The borderline cartoonish accent and the brashness of his words would have made the secretary cut off the prankster if not for Admiral Moorer having overheard the Reichkommisar's voice.

 MADAGASKAR_MAURICE.18.desc:0 "Willi Stoph had just returned from the frontlines to find that the GMA's temporary headquarters were even more of a mess than the Reichkommissariat's poor excuse for an army. Guarding the meeting were two boys, barely seventeen, with ill-fitting uniforms. Stoph thought they looked ridiculous. Although they saluted him, the mistmaching uniforms and probably dysfunctional guns they showed off while guarding the two columns on the entrance to the building made them almost a parody of military discipline. It was only after he went in that he realized one of them had a French Adrian helmet instead of a german model. Stoph shook his head. "Can't get any worse than this."\n\nHowever, Stoph soon found out he was wrong. Walking into the meeting, he found the GMA council in an absolute panic. "Wilhem, where the fuck have you been?" Horst von Oppenfeld's voice traveled across the room and hit Stoph quite suddenly. After composing himself, Stoph responded with the obvious, "Maurice sent me to organize the army, Horst. Didn't he tell you?" The assembled leadership of the colony looked at him as if he'd claimed martian ancestry. "Maurice is gone, he's vanished." A cold sweat struck Stoph at that moment. If they couldn't offer the Reichskommissar's head to the rebels, their ass would be on the line.\n\nNo sooner had Stoph joined the bickering GMA colleagues in discussion what to do, than the conscript with the Adrian helmet rushed in, handed over a note, and left. Von Oppenfeld had to read it outloud to believe it.\n\n"This is Admiral Moorer of the OFN's Indian Ocean Command. Reichskommissar Maurice is under our protection. We will extend such protection to you should you agree to the establishment of an OFN mandate over the island." By the format, all men knew it was a telegraph transcription, probably from a warship.

He set an example for all those who were more concerned with keeping the island German than with the idea of a nice retirement home in Florida. Soon, only Stoph, Schoeps, and a few low-ranking staff officers remained in the room.\n\n"I guess this is it then." Schoeps sighed deeply. "I suppose." Stoph looked at him for about thirty seconds before saying anything. After that, he ordered one of the staff officers to bring him a pen.\n\n"By this at, I, the acting Reichkommissar of Madagakar, hereby dissolve the Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten. Furthermore, as decided unanimously by the meeting of the Generalbüro, it is to be succeeded by the Provisional Unity Government of Madagascar, which shall administer the island until further notice."

They were outnumbered and outgunned, and even if the enemy couldn't get past them, they would run out of ammo eventually. There was nothing left to do. There was only one hope left for him now.\n\nShortly before, Maurice had sent a message to the Americans. He begged them, pleaded that they should send a helicopter to extract him. He'd been loyal to them, betraying Germany and offering the whole island for the chance to get off this miserable rock. The response on the other end had been horrifyingly ambiguous, and Maurice was left unsure of whether they were coming.\n\nThe sounds of battle got closer and closer to the palace. The army was nearly gone. It would be down to the palace guard, then, and they were brave and had an excellent defensive position, but even greater disadvantages in terms of number and firepower. They would have to get out of the palace and to the landing zone once they knew the helicopter was coming. If it was coming. They were taking a long time.

Finally, they were in sight of the LZ, and the helicopter was still there. The sounds of fighting were close by, though, and there was no telling how long they had. Maurice ran as quickly as he could. He was old, and tired, but this was all he had left. If he could just-\n\nHe tripped. Emil Maurice, Reichskommissar of Madagaskar, tripped and fell hard, and pain shot through his shoulder. He doubted he could get up, let alone get to the helicopter at this point. One of the soldiers hauled him up to his feet, prompting a fresh bout of pain, but the damage was done, and he was moving even slower now. Not that it mattered. When he looked forward again, Maurice saw the helicopter taking off. They were too late the whole time.\n\n"Fuck it." Johnson was pissed. They had flown through a whole sky of shit, coming out for some Nazi fuck, and he doesn't even show up? Fuck this. "We're getting out of here before we get killed. He's not coming. Probably got himself killed."\n\n"Yeah, alright," came the voice of his copilot as they lifted off. "Got some guys off to the left down there, careful."\n\n"I see them. No problem.

The palace guard had been involved in the fighting for some time now, and even if the Americans suddenly did turn up, which they weren't going to, Maurice doubted he could get out now. An explosion sounded, much louder than the previous ones. They were inside the building now. His office was locked, but that wouldn't stop anyone who didn't care about kicking in the door.\n\nMaurice hesitated a moment. What did it mean, that this was what it had all come to?
