POLITICS_Neil_Blaney_desc:0 "Neil Blaney should have been more careful with what he wished for.\n\nAt last, he has become Taoiseach, only to be the first holder of the office incapable of exercising any of its powers. For years, Blaney laboured to build a political machine in the Northern Counties that could propel his bid to power, but now that machine has consumed him, and Ireland.\n\nBlaney laughed as Seán Lemass proved foolish enough to trust the pro-Germans in the Irish military, glossing over the fact he was committing the same mistake. When Lemass attempted to jail him by revealing the extent of his involvement with the Arms Crisis, it was easy to convince the complicit officers that only a coup could save their careers. Who would have been to lead the resulting government than Neil Blaney, the man whose fate was intertwined with theirs?\n\nHowever, Blaney soon found out that the men behind the barrels had no personal loyalty to him, or anyone else but themselves. Only now that German-manufactured jackboots occupy every major city does Blaney realize that he has lost control over the monstrosity he created. The officers of the former NCSZ have no more sympathy for their former master than they do for the protestant civilians of the zone.\n\nWhile the country he loves languishes under the Regime of the Brigadiers, Neil Blaney can only look in despair and rubber stamp the decrees that the men in epaulets throw at his desk. This is not the future he wanted, but it is the one he caused."
POLITICS_Sean_McKeown_desc:0 "Ireland: divided once more. The fault of this national humiliation lies with the incompetent administrations that used the Defense Forces as the repository for the unemployed and gave away its wealth to Germany. A situation this dire called for a man who could stand above politics and save the country from civil war, that man was Seán McKeown.\n\nFor McKeown, the dismal performance of his beloved armed forces in the Northern Campaign proved too much to take. Knowing that the loss of Ulster was bound to push Ireland deeper into the arms of foreign powers, McKeown decided to put a stop to the never-ending subjugation of Eire to foreign powers by launching a coup with the remnants of the IDF. Now that he controls Ireland - or what is left of it - all that McKeown intends to do is restore the professionalism of the armed forces, before he can turn over the country to an elected authority, sometime in the future."
POLITICS_James_Kelly_desc:0 "Brigadier James Kelly joined the Irish Defense Forces shortly after the end of the Second World War, right as the influence of German military advisors began to take root. Owing to his brilliant performance, he was sent to Germany for further studies, before returning to Ireland and being assigned to Military Intelligence in the tumultuous Northern Counties. The posting put him in close contact with the Fianna Fáil political establishment, and after the German withdrawal a few years later, with Neil Blaney.\n\nWhile the Irish army became increasingly bloated as a consequence of German advisorship, a desire to maintain unemployment low, and the need to keep order in the Northern Counties, Kelly climbed the ranks with record speed. By 1960, he had become deputy chief of staff for Military Intelligence in the Northern Counties. Although initially identified as one of the officers who supported Blaney's use of paramilitary groups under the belief he was acting on the orders of Lemass, he rapidly developed misgivings about the Real IRA. At first, he protested against their counterproductive methods, but soon began to suspect that something was off with the organization at large.\n\nWhile Blaney attempted to put a stop to his investigation, Kelly and his connections in the Abwehr uncovered the truth about the R-IRA on their own. Released shortly after his arrest when it was revealed that he believed himself to be following orders from the government, he hurried to restore his reputation by presenting a plan to decapitate all terrorist organizations and restore order on behalf of his fellow officers.\n\nNow that his plan has been successful, Kelly can start to deconstruct Blaney's byzantine administration and replace it with something more conducive to stability. That, in any case, is what he told Seán Lemass. For while he would have liked to keep his promises, Lemass's stated intentions to reveal secret documents which could well implicate him in the initial contact between the IRA and Blaney. The undesirable prospect of his military career unfairly ending in disgrace has led to him making arrangements with fellow officers, which could well end badly for Ireland..."
POLITICS_Sean_Lemass_1_desc:0 "To say Seán Francis Lemass loves Ireland is an understatement. Since the rising against the British in 1916, he has been present ensuring a safe and prosperous future for the country. The ultimate recognition for his services was Éamon de Valera's endorsement for Taoiseach upon his retirement from the post. Thus, Lemass was thrust into the forefront of Irish politics, only to discover the dreadful state of the country.\n\nShortly after taking office, he was faced with economic meltdown, rebellion in the Northern Counties, and the shaky nature of his position. The legacy of his role in convincing de Valera to join the Germans during the attack on Northern Ireland haunts him as he watches Eire become more dependent on Berlin by the day. Every hour he spends as Taoiseach, Lemass grows more convinced he can do little more than slow the impending collapse of his own administration. In spite of this general pessimism Lemass has held on, and has, to his credit, managed to maintain Ireland's territorial integrity secured and its political system unchanged.\n\nUltimately however, Lemass's silent achievements will count for little if he cannot save the country for itself. While the difficulty of this job increases in proportion to the power of the opposition Fine Gael, and to the number of terror attacks in the Northern Counties, it is not an impossible task. If Lemass proves able to carry it out, Lemass will stand on the pantheon of Ireland's founding fathers. Should he fail, he shall be its undertaker."
POLITICS_Sean_Lemass_2_desc:0 "With his re-election, Seán Lemass has achieved all that he has ever wanted. The Blaney-Haughtey cabal and their allies lay defeated, while in the Northern Counties, there is peace. As the American puppets of Fine Gael languish in eternal opposition, Lemass looks out from his seat of power, and sees only victory.\n\nFor all of this winning, however, Lemass has found no happiness. As his health rapidly declines, Lemass must hurry to find a successor, or else risk his life's work being undone by those unworthy of leading Eire. The hard truth for Seán Lemass is that he cannot live forever, not in physical form, at least. With what little time he has left, the politician must now secure his legacy, so that the myth of Seán Lemass will stand for as long as Ireland exists."
POLITICS_Charles_Haughey_desc:0 "It has been a long road for Charles Haughey.\n\nIt took him years of painful backbench crawling, of a careful alliance with Neil Blaney, of slowly convincing DeValera that Lemass's incompetence was handing the country over to Fine Gael. In the end, it was worth it.\n\nWhile he must share power with Neil Blaney to avoid repeating the fate of his last two predecessors, his position as Taoiseach is secured. What If it took selling parts of the economy to Josef Abs and his friends? Politics was about compromise, and he has done what was necessary. Ireland's destiny may now be inseparable from that of Germany, that is true, but Haughey believes - nay, knows - that it will serve Eire best.\n\nOf course, there are those who would disagree. Fine Gael, Saor Éire, the Labour Party. These, however, are no longer a concern. With the passage of the National Stability Bill, Ireland has ceased to be weakened by things such as "the opposition". Haughey didn't like that either, but it was also a cost he is willing to pay, in order to ensure that his vision of Ireland in the New Order can be achieved."
POLITICS_Terence_ONeill_desc:0 "London born Terrence O'Neill, son of Arthur O'Neil, who had the dubious honor of being the first member of parliament to be killed in the first world war, has always been a man advocating peace and cooperation. As a young man he advocated respect towards the local Catholic Irishmen from the government, and later, when Ulster became the Northern Counties, he spoke often and at length of the cruelties that had been inflicted upon the protestants after the annexation, all while still refusing to condone a violent solution to the special situation. To some he was seen as a 'collaborator' as he worked for years within the Irish political system, but he never compromised on his ethics while he did so.\n\nWith his conciliatory attitude, and credibility among both the Catholics and the Protestants - it seems likely that Terence O'Neill is the perfect man to heal the wounds of the Northern Counties."
POLITICS_THOMAS_MCKENNA_DESC:0 "§wBorn:§! 1908, in Cork, Republic of Ireland\n\n§wMilitary Career:§!Vice Admiral Thomas McKenna of the Irish Naval Service began his career in the civilian sector, serving on an English owned shipping line. In 1942, McKenna studied at Camp Curragh in Kildare, where he quickly completed competency courses in anti-submarine warfare, land-air warfare, and indoctrination. After, he underwent a formal study of the highest levels of competency for officers of the Irish Defense Forces, the command and staff courses.\n\nCiting the need for homegrown officers, the newly established Naval Service in 1946 recruited McKenna to the Vice Admiralship, an office he has served faithfully. Though Ireland may hold one of the most humble navies in Europe, barely more than a glorified coast guard, some might say, McKenna dispenses his duties with pride, honor, and dignity."
POLITICS_Seamus_Twomey_ire_desc:0 "True to himself, Seamus Twomey didn't rush to be named President of the Republic after the revolution, nor Taoiseach, for that matter. No, he is no careerist politician. Nevertheless, Twomey knows he must retain power until, "all necessary social and economic reform to make Ireland truly free" have been carried out. Thus, Twomey deemed it necessary to remain in power by being named chief of staff for the Defense Forces, while retaining the same position within Saor Éire's paramilitary wing. Soon, both shall be one and the same, cleansed of all elements loyal to the Free State and its inherited Britishness. From their symbiosis will return the one institution which throughout the struggle for national freedom remained legitimate: The Irish Republican Army.\n\nWhat is more, with vestiges of the Free State deeply entrenched into the country's institutions, it is clear that transforming a state tainted by the original sin of the Anglo-Irish treaty is both impossible and undesirable: The civil service, the constitution, the phoney democracy which has made Ireland unfree. All of these must be cast into the ash-heap of history. In their place, a whole new structure must be erected, on which the principles of the Republican Movement reign supreme.\n\nFor all the vagueness of his proclamations, Twomey and his closest advisors know exactly what this new state will look like: A true working democracy, like that under which Saor Erie's command structure operates. A grassroots democracy. A democracy that can only take the form of the reconstituted Republican Army itself. The new IRA will become not just the Irish Armed forces, but Ireland itself.\n\nOnce he has completed the monumental task ahead of him, Twomey intends to retire at the earliest possible opportunity, and return in his words, "to watching football matches." Before he can do this, however, he's bound to face much opposition, likely including that from Ireland's ancestral foe, itself eying developments in the emerald isle with increasing concern..."

IRE_shame_of_the_giant_desc:0 "Eamon De Valera has long held a dream close to his heart: a dream of a united Ireland, free from Anglo dominance. During World War Two, the then Taoiseach accepted a deal with the devil to make his dream come true; should the Republic of Ireland collaborate with the Nazi regime, the Germans would support them in an invasion of Ulster, which was just barely accomplished through the sheer amount of German manpower thrown at the emerald isle.\n\nLike all Faustian bargains, however, the price is rarely one worth paying. German megacorporations control vast sectors of the Irish economy, and countless paramilitaries in Ulster threaten total revolt against Dublin. Fianna Fáil only holds on to power only through ruthless political suppression, press censorship, and imprisoning those who speak out too loudly against the regime.\n\nFaced with an increasing lack of confidence in De Valera's ability to govern, and Fianna Fáil's supermajority in the Dáil starting to crumble, Seán Lemass, De Valera's chosen successor, kicked the old man upstairs, to the largely ceremonial Presidency. Lemass has since tried to steer Ireland out of the nightmare that is De Valera's twisted dream. However, should Lemass prove inadequate to the task at hand, those around him can convince De Valera to use the one real power available to his office: The ability to appoint a new Taoiseach."
IRE_finance_bill_desc:0 "Despite how we may seem to the rest of the world, and the best efforts of the Taoiseach, the Republic of Ireland remains functionally a democracy. Lemass, like all leaders in a democratic system, cannot simply spend Ireland's money as he sees fit, and must seek the support of the Dáil Éireann, the Irish Parliament, to pay for the various projects he has envisioned.\n\nOur Minister of Finance Jack Lynch has proposed the budget for this fiscal year, leaving it much the same as last year's but with one key difference: Irish businesses will be subsidized at the expense of the German megacorporations. Lynch has done about as well as could be expected with his proposal, now it's time for the Taoiseach to get to work and push the proposal through the Dáil."
IRE_pollution_control_bill_desc:0 "As 1962 dawns, the world finds itself on a precipice. The Hawaiian Missile Crisis, Hitler's ailing health, and the threat of global thermonuclear war finds the world cowering in fear, awaiting the end. Life goes on, however, and Fianna Fáil continues to govern for the good of the people of Ireland. On the docket now: the issue of pollution. The TDanna, members of the Irish Dáil, have found that the enormous amount of pollution created by the factories of the German megacorporations is a large problem to their constituents. The solution: a bill has been proposed that would impose regulations on these factories, forcing them to at least put a token effort into cleaning up after themselves instead of simply dumping their refuse into our rivers and skies. This will likely annoy the megacorporations, but this is what the people want, and it's high time we remind them that this is Ireland, not the Reich."
IRE_what_the_left_has_left_desc:0 "As it happens every year, we must review the state of welfare in Ireland. Recently we've had to deal with an increase in job protection due to the current state of our economy. While the Liberals are the smallest group in the party, a large part of our support rides on Labour supporting us as well. If we want to continue to keep their support we need to make concessions to them.\n\nThere's been quite the issue recently with women's rights in Ireland. The liberals have begun to improve the rights and begin to pass laws making them equal to men, giving them a large rise in support. Along with the increase in public transportation for children to get to school. While many of us disagree with the issues that the Liberals are fighting for, we cannot risk our coalition. We should send this Welfare Bill through the Parliament to see if we can maintain our coalition, hopefully it will hold."
IRE_civillian_investment_bill_desc:0 "After our recent elevations, we have found out that our infrastructure is good, but not nearly as great as it should be. Our current budget for the year is limited, but we can see if we can stretch it. If it is possible to stretch the budget, we should try as much as possible. The more money we can acquire from projects that aren't needed can be funneled into public works and infrastructure.\n\nThis bill, if passed will give us more funds that we have allocated to our budget. Using this money we can begin to invest wholly into Ireland. We will direct a large chunk of the funds into the railway line that runs across Ireland, making our shipping more efficient. This should, in turn, help our economy. We can also give the leftover funds to investors and entrepreneurs to build Irish businesses."
IRE_the_northern_three_desc:0 "Jack Lynch, Frank Aiken, and Brendan Corish. While these men may not always agree, there is no doubt that they are the face of Irish liberalism. All three agree on the many social issues that Ireland faces today. A large topic for the three men is the status of the Magdalene Laundries in Ireland.\n\nThese so-called "Asylums" had been created by the Church to serve as places to restore the honor of "Fallen Women", mostly prostitutes and females with no other family. These laundries have been quite the stain on Ireland as the Archbishop of Dublin attempts to cover it up. We must figure out a way to shut down these establishments and to help these women. If we can do this, this will surely help our cause. Once we do follow through with this, we should see a reduction in the power that McQuaid has over the government. This should usher in new liberals to help us."
IRE_the_dublins_archbishop_desc:0 "There is one man in Ireland who wields significant power over the people and the government. This man is none other than the Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuade.\n\nThe Archbishop is a personal friend of De Valera and will definitely help us in our cause to rally the hardliners back to our side. If we can rally enough of them, we can definitely begin to take back the Fianna Fáil. However, there is one thing that stands in front of us. The issue of woman's rights in Ireland is a subject that is hotly contested. Brendan Corish and his followers have begun to campaign against the Magdalene Laundries that are in Ireland.\n\nThese Asylums had been created to make "Fallen Woman" pure again and closer to God. While the idea is seen as a thing of the past, it brings in large amounts of money for the hardliner cause. It is in our best interests that these Laundries stay open for the future. "
IRE_still_one_party_desc:0 "For decades, our Taoiseach De Valera and now the incumbent Lemass have kept the Republic of Ireland running relatively smoothly under the leadership of the Fianna Fáil. Sure, there have been hiccups, requiring us to make deals with Irish Labour that we really rather would not have made, as well as do some shady political practices, but Fianna Fáil still governs. Sure, the political opposition may call us a corrupt cesspool of political violence, but they fail to understand the nuance of the position we find ourselves in. Ireland sits on a knife's edge, balanced between political pressure from Germany, growing Irish nationalism and calls for complete political independence, and tensions from rogue paramilitaries and terrorist organizations in Ulster. Only the Fianna Fáil has been able to keep Ireland from falling apart at the seams, and only Fianna Fáil will continue to be able to do so. This is why we must continue our governance at all costs."
IRE_labour_protection_bill_desc:0 "As much as we wished it were otherwise, the Fianna Fáil does not govern Ireland alone. Having formed a coalition with the Irish Labour Party, it is important that we sometimes take steps to appease them so that they don't leave and have our government fall apart. An issue has recently come to light that should allow us to keep them happy for now. After a series of deaths caused by an industrial accident at a factory owned by IG Farben, workers have begun to strike after a series of deaths caused by industrial accidents, and are demanding safer working conditions.\n\nWe will oblige them.\n\nWe will propose a bill that will impose safety regulations in these factories, mandating break times and regular safety inspections to keep accidents to a minimum. While this might damage our relationship with Germania, it's better to risk that than have our government fall apart."
IRE_campaign_with_corish_desc:0 "The current status quo that holds Ireland together is a coalition government we hold with the help of our friends in the Labour party. While we don't actually need to promise anything to the workers for our coalition to hold in the current political climate, if we hold a few high profile rallies that show our politicians standing side by side with popular Labour leader Brendan Corish - people can make the educated guess that we're a pro-worker administration."
IRE_on_the_peoples_side_desc:0 "A democracy runs on the will of the people. This means that a good leader in a democracy should hold the same opinions as the people he rules over. In this respect, Seán Lemass is a great leader. Lemass listens to the people he governs, structuring policy based on their most immediate needs. If the people want a new bridge over the river Shannon, then Lemass will get the funding to build that bridge. If the people want a strong military to protect them, then Lemass will make their military strong. If the people want to remove protections from Irish Protestants, then, well, Lemass certainly won't oppose removing said protections. It is what the people want after all, and doing what the people want will both keep them voting Fianna Fáil at the polls, and make sure that everybody knows Seán Lemass is on their side."
IRE_religious_education_bill_desc:0 "What are the values that define an Irishman? A good Irishman is a brave, proud, firmly republican man who loves his country and his family. More importantly, a good Irishman is a god fearing Catholic. As the stewards of Ireland and her people, it is our responsibility to raise the children of Ireland to follow this ideal. We will introduce a bill to the Dáil to reform the education system to focus on teaching Catholic moralism over newer, less necessary subjects. By controlling what is taught in our public schools, we can influence societal development and will ensure every child knows that Irish values are Catholic values."
IRE_media_regulation_bill_desc:0 "The age of the television is upon us. Television and Radio have exploded recently. Nearly every house in Ireland has a television, and nearly everyone has a place they can find a radio. These devices are usually used to broadcast world events, sports, and the weather. The main focus for us the many newspapers in Ireland. All with their independent ideas and mantras.\n\nHowever, these can be great tools to garner interest in our cause. Currently, there is lots of propaganda flooding around. Whether the news corporation is pro-nazi or pro-socialist, even run by Protestants. We need to put a stop to this with the bill. Once we can limit this, we can start to print our own pro-FF news."
IRE_IECC_bill_desc:0 "If there was one thing in our history that many of us can agree on that was a mistake, was taking the German's up on their offer. In due time, we had been shackled to their trade laws and forced into the so-called "Einheitspakt". This has led to a disaster for our economy as we no longer have direct control of our government. Instead, the German's nudge our economy and government to shift their way. One of the consequences that have come along with the German's is the megacorporations that have tens of thousands of slaves working in Germany.\n\nNeil Blaney, the boot-licker, has submitted a bill to the Oireachtas. He calls it the "Irish Economic Cooperation Council". We need to figure out how we will deal with the bill. If we accept it, it will bring us closer to Germany. However, it will keep Blaney at bay in his "fiefdom" and raise our GDP. We need to decide. "
IRE_state_corporations_bill_desc:0 "Maybe we had judged Neil Blaney too harshly at first it seems.\n\nWhile he may not be the best representative for Ireland in the Einheitspakt, the IECC Bill has created jobs that we desperately need. Our GDP has also arisen and should hopefully continue to grow thanks to this new bill. Now, riding on the success of his last bill, Blaney has submitted a new one called the "State Corporations Bill." This bill seems to alleviate some of the issues that we would have with an increased German presence. It calls for the creation of state-owned cartels that will control the energy and shipyards of Ireland to make sure the German's can't get their hands on them.\n\nFrom what we've heard coming out of Germany, it seems that the whole country is in turmoil. It's probably in our best interests that we pass this bill and make sure Ireland is safe."
IRE_the_right_is_right_desc:0 "While we may not always agree with Neil Blaney, we can agree on something. His rule over the Northern Counties has been quite well. While we may not have an exact idea of what goes on inside the zone, we do know that his administration has been serving Ireland well.\n\nHowever in recent weeks after Blaney has received more clout due to his actions with both the IECC Bill and the State Corporations Bill. He has become a local celebrity of sorts within Dublin. Many know him as the man who runs the Northern Counties and the man who is attempting to save Ireland from economic doom. While this may not be totally true, let us make him believe that.\n\nBlaney has recently asked for a new shipment of weapons to get delivered to the Northern Counties for the Irish soldiers based there. There is a chance that this causes an outcry due to the methods that Blaney uses. It's probably for the better we send him the weapons though as he gets the job done."
IRE_increase_NIC_funding_desc:0 "The North Irish Constabulary is perhaps the most disastrous success story for our great nation. The N.I.C. is single-handedly our greatest ally in the mess that is the Special Situation in the Northern Counties - yet contrarily, their blatant and unrestrained corruption shows no signs of slowing down or ceasing.\n\nOn the other hand though, it means that we can trust them so long as the money keeps flowing."
IRE_public_meetings_bill_desc:0 "The protests by the Ulsterites have begun to get more and more violent as time goes on. Each day it seems like tensions get hotter and hotter. There's a chance it could boil over at any moment. While we may not exactly like the Ulsterites by any means, we still need to prevent a full-on war breaking out in Belfast and the surrounding regions.\n\nOur solution is to make a bill that will restrict the size of public meetings to ten people only. No more than that or the assembly is considered unlawful. This should begin to restrict the protests massively and give us an opportunity to arrest the troublemakers without causing a huge issue. Now we wait for these troublemakers to protest and we can arrest them."
IRE_erin_go_bragh_desc:0 "The country has finally been stabilized. Our economy is finally stable for once and not on the verge of collapsing on itself. Ulster has thankfully been stabilized as well, so now we can finally focus on other things. We can finally relax for a few moments in time, maybe throw a small celebration. However, we should begin to plan out the next few years.\n\nWhile it may seem that we are finished on the domestic stage. We still have lots to do on the international stage and even some issues back home. One of them being the situation with Ulster. While it is seemed to have stabilized, it still could boil over at any moment. On the international stage, we need to contend the issue of re-opening talks with Germany. However, right now is a time of celebration for Ireland!"

Now, it seems that the rumors have come to a head; Hitler is dead, his great Reich is in its death throes. Now, the various factions within the German government make war with each other in a desperate bid for power, leaving the remaining nations within the Einheitspakt, all made to be dependent on the Reich in one sense or another, to fend for themselves.\n\nIreland's economy, like many of those in the Pakt, has only survived thus far on the backs of the German investors and megacorporations, both sources of revenue that have now dried up entirely due to the chaos of the German Civil War. Ireland stands alone for the first time in decades, and the economy has begun to flatline. Something must be done to stabilize the nation and fix the problem, and it must be done soon if we ever hope to recover."
IRE_hold_on_tight_desc:0 "The Irish economy is in free-fall. Prices are collapsing, production is grinding to a halt, people are waking up with fortunes acquired over a lifetime of work vanished before their eyes. Something must be done. We will close the stock market indefinitely to try to put a halt to brokers selling their stock in a panic. In the meanwhile, we will also print more money in an effort to try to fill the hole left by the departure of the German investors. This will likely do no more than slow down the total economic collapse Ireland is tumbling towards, and will be terrible for the Irish economy in the long run, but we can worry about the long run when the Irish people can afford to buy food and the country isn't collapsing around us."
IRE_seatbelts_everyone_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Hitler's death and the chaos in Germany, big corporations that once stood tall with the assistance of the Reich find themselves teetering on the edge of oblivion. Enormous sectors of the Irish economy are tied up one way or another with large companies and conglomerates, and their failure would tear giant holes in our already tattered economy. These corporations are simply too big to fail. We will bail out these large corporations so that they can make it through the crisis without falling completely apart. It's sure to be an unpopular move among the people of Ireland, but they'll see it was necessary when we make it through this in one piece."
IRE_JUST_CALM_DOWN_desc:0 "The people of Ireland are quite reasonably in a state of panic. Decades of economic growth have been dashed against the stones in a matter of hours, and the people suddenly can't afford basic necessities like food and water. We need to calm them down before they start rioting in the streets. Seán Lemass will give a series of televised speeches to the public, urging calm in this time of crisis. He will also very publicly accept a lower pay, and strongly urge other members of the government to follow suit. We must do all we can to show the people that we are on top of the situation, and give the people of Ireland just a little bit of hope in these troubling times."
IRE_unite_the_dail_desc:0 "The Dáil has always been a contentious body of lawmakers. Day in and day out, our TD's bicker and fight, angling for more political power and influence, either personal or for their party. Factions within the Dáil war with each other, all hoping to drive Ireland along towards their vision. This has to stop. For the most part, we were willing to let the TD's have their petty conflicts, but in the economic crisis we find ourselves in, this is no longer acceptable. For once, the Dáil must unite behind one banner, one plan, one ideal for Ireland: that of the Taoiseach. They may not like it, but they'll damn well comply if they want to keep Ireland in one piece. They can get back to their petty bickering after we've brought our great nation back from the brink of destruction."
IRE_and_now_what_desc:0 "A few months ago, the Republic of Ireland faced one of her greatest crises in the modern era. Ireland's economy, tied as it was to the now fractured German Reich, began to rapidly collapse in on itself and could not be stopped; Ireland was on a path to ruin. Thankfully, our emergency measures have worked; and while we may not have managed to completely stop the collapse, not yet, we have managed to slow it down enough that we have a little bit of room to breathe. Even still, we're not out of the woods yet. We must come up with a more permanent plan of action than our current emergency stop-gap measures. If we fail, all of our effort, all of our sacrifices, all we have done will have been for nothing. We must not let that happen. The dream of Ireland must not die."

Thankfully, however, we do not need to come up with a solution for our problems by ourselves. Fianna Fáil has governed the Republic of Ireland through many crises over the past few decades, and surely will be able to help us come up with a solution for this one. Seán Lemass has called for a general congress of the Fianna Fáil party, where we will discuss possible solutions for our issue. All current members of the party will come together in a great effort to finally find a solution. With so many people working on the current problem, someone will have to be able to come up with a solution for us.\n\nRight?"

Thankfully, we have one last option available to us: the coalition. We will summon the entirety of our government coalition, all members of both Fianna Fáil and Irish Labour, to one grand conference, where we will discuss plans and attempt to find a solution to the economic collapse, to once and for all save the Republic of Ireland.\n\n§RWe are running out of time.

We cannot in good conscience ignore the realities of our situation any longer, we are now in an economic depression and our people will soon be beginning in the streets should we do nothing about it.\n\nOf course, the actual course of action we shall take is something of an open question. There are enough conflicting interests and political heavyweights shoving their opinions around on this issue that it could well be a challenge to solve at all. Still, we are not a land renowned for inaction. We shall bring Ireland back to her glory, for we fear what could occur if we do not. "
IRE_back_to_the_drawing_board_desc:0 "We will need all the parties on board with what we are about to do if it is to have any chance of succeeding. All the factions and cliques, everyone of influence will need some say in the planning process, or at least some method of making their desires understood. Naturally we will choose what is best of Ireland at the end of it, yet we cannot escape that necessity that broad support in the political class is vital to getting anything done around here.\n\nOn a secondary note, we should see to what degree our foreign officer can inform us on the desires of the Americans and Reich, if one or the other is especially open it might be beneficial to choose one course of action over another."
IRE_choosing_a_plan_desc:0 "Seán Lemass, Seán MacEntee, Brendan Corish. Three men who each have a vision for Ireland's future which promises to be full of wealth for all and for us most of all. Yet in a perhaps fitting dilemma each and everyone one of their policies is directly at odds with one another. Lemass wants us joined at the hip to the Americans, heedless of what the Germans would say. Corish is practically a socialist, with all the political problems implied, and MacEntee wants to all but cut us off from the global markets and re-institute austerity, heedless of the human cost. Yet each of their plans has promise, we need only choose the one which benefits Ireland the most."
IRE_lemass_rising_tide_desc:0 "Seán Lemass, quite the controversial figure that one. The game he advocates we play is a dangerous one, indeed one with some potentially quite severe consequences should we fall off the proverbial tightrope he asks we cross. In short, Lemass advocates that Ireland pull more generally towards the Organisation of Free Nations more than the Unity Pakt. Given our relations with the former Commonwealth in general and the English in particular this is asking a lot. But the question is can we trust Germany to act rationally any more? If we tie ourselves to closely to the behemoth of the Reich we may well get pulled under with it, and the Americans, whatever their flaws, are always happy to make some money."
IRE_eyes_to_the_west_desc:0 "Our relationship with the Reich has never been what one might call cordial. Their business interests used us where they could and in return we were not subject to the fate of Norway, Denmark and Poland. Their track record with abiding by the wills of even staunch allies is somewhat poor, so it falls to us to make the assessment of whether sticking solely with Germany from an economic prospect is viable economically. Right now it isn't looking so good for the Krauts.\n\nThe Americans have more money, historical ties, more Irishmen than the Reich does. International politics is not a game for the faint of heart or sentiment, Ireland follows that which will benefit it best."
IRE_the_trade_marks_bill_desc:0 "Trademarks and patents, such an American way of doing things. Privatising intellectual and physical property to ensure those with the money to claim it first receive the rewards. Despite our misgivings, it might be worth considering for Ireland to get back on track with respecting the American and more generally OFN derived intellectual property rights. At least on some nominal level, what we can plausibly deny hardly counts after all.\n\nThe Americans ought to appreciate the gesture for what it is, and even if they don't their businessmen will. In the end its a sacrifice for the greater good. What else is there to do after all?"
IRE_in_the_tracks_of_immigrants_desc:0 "In the 1800's, the neglect of the British Empire caused millions of our people to starve or flee to other nations during the Potato Famine.

Forming a cultural block which has continued to exist even unto this day.\n\nPerhaps now that we seek closer ties with the Yankees, we might use our contacts in these communities to open their ears somewhat to our proposals. To show that at the heart of things, we seek to mend our mistakes from the days of the war. With some luck we might even get the opportunity to have some of them establish business ties."
IRE_promises_to_the_germans_desc:0 "Much like any monster from the old tales, the German Reich is a paranoid and jealous beast, prone to lashing out in anger at those perceived as slighting it. Ireland will need to calm the Germans, alay their suspicions and fears with soothing words and promises. We will howl to the skies about our close historical ties and relationships. We will have jovial conversations with officials and businessmen.\n\nWe can't expect to leave fully after all, we merely need to make it clear that we intend to continue our relationship at a distance. So long as we are careful on that front, we ought not need to worry about the Reich landing on our shores any time soon."

They might not find anything on the sheer scale of the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls, but what there is to partake in is well worth the trip over the Atlantic.\n\nWe ought not to focus too heavily on the stereotypes about Ireland in America though. No mentions of leprechauns or four leaf clovers will be tolerated."

To the effect of ceasing a good portion of the trade and business we did with our friends over the Atlantic, and very specifically with the entire membership of the Organisation of Free Nations.\n\nNow that we seek to rebuild these connections, we will need to invest more than simple promises of money. We'll need to ensure those who might be leery of a potential backslide that their investments will be secure, we'll have to rebuild some connections that had been in place for centuries before the rise of the Germans broke them. But anything worth doing isn't easy. We shall persevere."

This is worse than being a security risk, it makes us look weak to the Americans and if they think us weaklings they will dismiss us as a potential ally.\n\nWe will need to build up our forces somewhat, we have the men after all just not the capacity to best utilise them at the present time. More poignantly, any future exercises can finally take into account the possibility of a German foe."

Whilst a drastic measure, we cannot defeat the Germans or even reliably delay them long enough for aid to arrive at the present moment with our present forces. The world is not a kind place, it is not a generous place.

We plan to use that, and promising him some payment, to convince him to brighten our image across the Atlantic.\n\nMostly propaganda to be quite blunt, but perhaps some cartoons show Ireland in a positive light as well.

Untangling ourselves from the German web may prove difficult, if we can achieve the Irish economy can stand on its own.

In these hard times, great measures must be taken to bring our economy back in the right direction. The strong, hardworking should receive more benefits and rights, as our strong industrial base will be built on their backs. As well, we must take a look at the economic policies still in place from the fifties, and work to weed out policies that would work against our re-imagining of the Irish economy. Loopholes that allowed German corporations to grow so influential that their loss would crash our economy must be closed. If we are to bring the Irish economy into a new age, bring our workers new rights and better benefits, and sever ourselves from the German web, we must succeed in all of these goals."

Eire must no longer allow her economy to be at the whim of foreign interests, be they German or American. However, chasing every foreign company out of Ireland isn't what we need either. In fact, we should make Ireland more enticing for foreign corporations to set up headquarters, but we should always remember to put Irish needs first. For now, at least, our efforts should be focused on our recovery, or none of these goals will be achieved."

This bill will finally tackle the issue of the remaining German corporations. If this bill passes, we will spin off the German companies into new, Irish based investment companies. This will allow us to preserve the economic value of these companies, but ensure that this value will go to Ireland instead. This will also open up many new employment opportunities for Irish workers. We expect the remaining German businessmen to firmly oppose this measure, but what can they do but complain to their dying fatherland?"
IRE_system_of_the_past_desc:0 "In olden days, smaller countries could punch above their weight in the global economic ring through protectionism. Small nations would put their economic interests first, limiting imports and imposing tariffs, and engaging in free trade only if our internal economy could support it. We abandoned this policy with the rise of the Pakt, and we hedged our bets and let German corporations run our economy. We thought this era of prosperity with the German sphere would never end. Never again will Ireland tie her economy to a foreign power, for economic empires rise and fall, but Ireland always survives.

Reducing the healthcare budget would reintroduce money into our system that we could invest in building our industrial base, but it would greatly anger Labour.

Companies, from American fast food, to Japanese electronics could find Ireland a suitable European hub, free from conflict or international entanglements. Taxes on foreign corporations that want to base themselves in Ireland should be lowered, and our government will begin an international outreach campaign that will paint Ireland as a great place to headquarter any company's European operations. Attracting foreign corporations will bring great amounts of wealth to our economy, bringing money we can invest into strengthening our economic base."

We will not need the intrusive intervention to help our economy grow. Ireland will make itself strong."
IRE_more_rights_for_the_worker_desc:0 "A happy worker is a productive worker, and in recent times our labourers have been outright miserable. They have suffered immensely from the exploitation enforced by their employers, whilst the government has done little to help. The confidence of workers will have to be restored so that their morale is raised and their faith in our economy is strengthened.\n\nRights, that were previously withheld, will be introduced so that the people know the government is on their side. We must hope that when the people are satisfied, so is the market."
IRE_germans_still_rule_desc:0 "Despite the recent turn to protectionism, there is an unsettling reality that will need to be addressed. This reality is the vast German presence that exists in our economy. They control a lot of power over our industry and without them, the economic outlook for our country will be bleak.\n\nRemoving all foreign interference from Ireland will prove much harder than first anticipated, but, given time, we can still hope that there will be a chance for us to pull away from the pakt."
IRE_industrial_grants_amendment_bill_desc:0 "After our efforts to limit foreign competition are enforced, we will need to ensure that our industry makes the strongest expansion possible. Funds will therefore need to be provided to our local industries to help them grow and hopefully go on to enrich our people. We will ensure these enterprises are successful, so we can weaken our reliance on foreign imports; so that Ireland can become a truly economic independent nation."
IRE_tariff_commission_amendment_bill_desc:0 "A new committee is to be introduced in order to oversee the changes to our tariff policy, which the government has deemed necessary. They will introduce a new era of increased trade between the countries of Ireland, Scotland and Wales; binding our economies closer together - as well as distancing us from the German economic hegemon, which has done little short of pillaging our country over the course of our cooperation.\n\nThe Tariff Commission will set our economy free and finally give it a chance to grow the wealth Ireland will need to be strong in the coming years."
IRE_third_amendment_to_constitution_bill_desc:0 "For the last twenty years, Ireland has been a client state of Germany in all but name. While we were technically an equal partner, De Valera's government signed numerous military treaties and agreements with the Reichspakt that left us firmly tied to the ship of German policy, even after the last German troops themselves left Ireland. The proposed Third Amendment to the Constitution will cancel all such military agreements and treaties and enshrine Ireland's neutrality as a constitutional principle. We should bear in mind, however, that even should the bill pass, these bold words will not have as big an impact on our politics as it might seem. Materially, the Germans will retain much influence over us, and we will need to consider further measures."
IRE_future_of_technology_desc:0 "While the rest of the world surges forward into the future, Ireland remains stuck in the past. Centuries of British rule left us with industrial underdevelopment as the norm, and even since independence our industry and agriculture have lagged behind, lacking the necessary investment to bring them up to modern standards. Other countries are making great strides in computing, robotics, and increased mechanization. If our Republic is to keep pace with her rivals, not only technologically but economically, we need to focus on improving our own capabilities in such matters."
IRE_made_in_ireland_desc:0 "Our people's confidence in the quality of our products needs a boost, and what better way to do that than to proudly advertise their origins instead of hiding our light under a bushel? Every sticker, label, and packaging of everything that leaves a factory in Ireland will now bear a little marker with a tricolor flag on it: Made In Ireland. Not only will this serve as a guarantor of quality for our own population, who will be happy to realise just how much we produce ourselves, but it will mean that people all over the world will come to associate Ireland with superior goods and bring more export profits our way."
IRE_emerald_shines_bright_desc:0 "Ireland's vibrant green fields have given it the sobriquet 'Emerald Isle', but for the last twenty years the sparkle on the emerald was dimmer than we'd like. Smeared and dirty under German economic domination, and lacking the reforms necessary to bring transform our economy from pre-mechanization agrarianism to the powerhouse we knew it could be, the poetic name for our nation had never seemed less apt. No more. Our economic reforms are beginning to tell, and the Irish economy is a powerful rising force. The emerald's shimmering brilliance will be known all over the world!"
IRE_corish_new_republic_desc:0 "Seemingly endless compromise talks and under the table threats to break the coalition if Labour's economic proposals are not entertained have won out. The shaky coalition has agreed to commit to Brendan Corish's 'New Republic' plan for economic regeneration. After all these years of domination by the right, Corish has declared that the seventies will be socialist, and this plan is how Ireland will get there. The Party of Connolly is in the driving seat!"
IRE_equal_growth_plan_desc:0 "The primary objective of the Equal Growth Plan is to ensure that economic recovery comes to everyone in Ireland, not just the rich and the corporate interests. It is ludicrous to think that a man with wealth is the equal of a man without, and so the wealthy of Ireland will bear the biggest burden in pulling the country out of depression. The rich will help the poor, and all will benefit. Corish is confident that this plan will meet with wide approval; all that is necessary now is to unveil it to the public."
IRE_bread_and_roses_desc:0 "Social democrats the world over sing out 'Bread and Roses!' as their rallying cry: that the populace deserves to have not only the necessities of life, but also the things that make life worth living. The time has come for our government to make this slogan a reality for our people. We shall ensure peace, stability, and happiness throughout Ireland: yes, it is bread we fight for, but we fight for roses too!"
IRE_state_of_the_worker_desc:0 "No country can thrive in the long term if the working class is not thriving. The workers are the bedrock of the economy and any problems they have will reverberate throughout society as a whole, sending fault lines upwards. We must ensure that our workers are happy and secure, but we cannot do that if we lack a clear understanding of their problems. A commission will be established to assess the condition of the workers of Ireland, and enable us to identify and deal with issues facing them today."
IRE_wider_middle_class_desc:0 "Social mobility is an important concern for the Republic. Our middle class is small, but economically potent, and we can strengthen the economy of the nation by making sure that this section of society continues to grow. The government shall make it easier for workers to better themselves and their situations by providing help in such areas as home-buying, access to education, and poverty relief initiatives. This will pay huge dividends in taxes and greater economic power in the future."
IRE_pensions_bill_desc:0 "We will introduce a bill in the Dáil to reform state pensions for our workforce along the lines of social insurance. The state will pay out a pension based on contributions given throughout workers' lives, meaning that the more workers put in, the more they get back in their pensions after retiring. We hope this will encourage people to work more and contribute more to the economy during their careers, while also providing them with a secure standard of living in their old age."
IRE_trade_union_year_bill_desc:0 "The trade unions up to now have not played the role they should have in Irish society. This is not the fault of the unions; they have struggled to organize due to lack of rights for unions and their members. Corish's proposed Trade Union Bill will enshrine some of these rights, such as collective bargaining without fear of reprisal from employers, and preventing discrimination of any kind against union members."
IRE_economic_development_bill_desc:0 "Ireland is a chronically under-developed country which has freely allowed its capital to be exported to the biggest money market in the world. This is a policy entirely unfavourable to home industries struggling to establish themselves, and especially difficult to deal with at a local level. The Economic Development Bill will establish temporary planning committees in county council areas, using local expertise and knowledge to direct government investment at grassroots level. The government will invest its capital at home instead of letting it be siphoned off abroad."
IRE_mother_child_service_bill_desc:0 "To date, Ireland's women and children have suffered under antiquated social sensibilities and a disregard for the special healthcare needs they have. The Mother and Child Service Bill, if it passes, will allow all Irish women and under-16s to receive medical care free at the point of use, subsidised by the government. This will be a huge improvement for the circumstances of some of the most vulnerable in our society!"
IRE_promises_in_the_dail_desc:0 "To deal with the backlash to the Mother and Child Service Bill, we need to tackle each disgruntled group head-on. The representatives from FG and FF in the Dáil can probably be appeased if we promise to implement some economic reforms along the lines of what they've been clamouring for previously. Their 'principled moral and theological opposition' to birth control will undoubtedly disappear if we dangle a free trade carrot in front of them."
IRE_dublin_protests_of_year_desc:0 "Conservatism is a huge force in Irish society, and we might have underestimated just how fiercely people believe in keeping things the way they are. The Mother and Child Service Bill has caused uproar after it was understood that free birth control comes under 'healthcare' for the women of our country, and every priest and pub loudmouth in the country has been mouthing off about the immorality of this. Protests have filled the streets of Dublin, led by church groups and TDs from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and are blocking the bridges over the Liffey. We have to find ways to deal with this unrest, or the country could grind to a halt over something as simple as contraceptives!"
IRE_promises_to_the_church_desc:0 "The Catholic Church is an immensely powerful institution in Ireland, and of all the opponents to the Mother and Child Service Bill they are the fiercest. Every priest rules like an autocrat in his own parish, with the full backing of the bishops and cardinals, and most will not hesitate to interfere in the personal lives of their parishioners. In this context, they see this bill as a direct insult and attack by the government on the legitimacy of their social control. But no matter how we feel about the Church's dominance in Irish society, we cannot afford to upset them too much. We must engage the Church leadership in dialogue and reassure them that we are not enemies, and that Christian principles of charity and care take precedence over their concerns about the bill. If we can get the cardinals and bishops to calm down, the priests and their congregations will follow."
IRE_tariff_commission_amendment_bill_2_desc:0 "The original Tariff Commission was abolished in 1939, but reinstated after the German victory in the Second World War as part of the requirement for joining the Reichspakt and restricting trade outside of that bloc. We will introduce a bill that alters the Tariff Commission's responsibilities, allowing trade with Scotland and Wales and slight increases on trade with OFN members. Fianna Fáil's members will greatly appreciate this, as they have been advocating such changes for a while, and this will be an easy way to shore up the government's support while also giving the economy a shot in the arm."
IRE_fighting_poverty_desc:0 "The best way to get the support of the man in the street is to improve his material conditions. Poverty is still rife in Ireland, as the country struggles with the impact of centuries of deliberate underdevelopment. As a government that has the interests of its people at the forefront of our minds, we will establish anti-poverty measures at the local level to ease the burden on the poorest in our society and make them productive members of the nation and the economy. Subsidised childcare and vaccination initiatives, for example, would have a huge effect on the health and economic wellbeing of our people in a very short time."
IRE_state_of_education_desc:0 "Irish education is stuck in the past like so many other things in this country. Most schools are controlled by the Catholic Church and comparatively few children go through secondary schooling when compared with other countries. We need to modernize the education system, providing free secondary schooling for all children and ensuring that the curriculum is decided by teachers rather than priests. In particular, we will introduce Economics classes for older children, teaching principles of social democratic economic regulation so that catastrophes like this depression can be avoided in the future."
IRE_promote_christian_socialism_desc:0 "While orthodox Leninists and Bukharinists might claim that religion is incompatible with socialist principles, Brendan Corish disagrees, and indeed has described the Labour Party as a Christian socialist party. Didn't the Apostles themselves share their property between them and devote their lives to helping the vulnerable? Didn't our Lord? There is nothing to say that Christianity - Catholicism, even - must be the preserve of the conservatives. The scriptures say otherwise, and so does man's conscience! Ireland is a deeply religious country - our best chance to promote socialist values is to make the obvious connection with Christian principles, and promote a Christian Socialism that will advance the cause of Ireland and of Christ."
IRE_green_lines_in_stocks_desc:0 "At long last, the depression is showing signs of ending. Dublin Stock Exchange is no longer the gloomy place it has been in recent times, and the traders and businessmen strolling along Dame Street have a spring in their step once again. It would be foolish to count our chickens before they've all hatched, but it seems like our policies have paid off: the economy is in the green again, and Corish's New Republic is being vindicated day by day."
IRE_farewell_to_depression_desc:0 "The New Republic has proven its worth! Detractors said it was pie-in-the-sky idealism, but Brendan Corish and the Labour Party have shown that it was pragmatism instead, and that economic realism need not be synonymous with callousness and austerity. The worst effects of the depression have disappeared and even the less ruinous effects have been mitigated and effectively combated. A new Ireland is ahead of us, with foundations laid for a strong and prosperous nation following principles of Christian socialism. The seventies will be socialist, just as Corish said!"
IRE_restoring_public_trust_desc:0 "Thousands are out of work, lining the streets in search of jobs, relief, or even a warm meal. Factories are closed, and stores are shuttered. Everywhere, people wonder if tomorrow they'll get a pink slip, or if their kids will go hungry. How can anyone feel pride in being from Ireland? And how can anyone even think of voting for Fianna Fáil, the ones who messed up in the first place?\n\nRegardless of how much blame is put on us versus outside factors, we have to confront the fact that people do not like us head on. We're the party that saw the people of Ireland through terrible situations like this. We're the party you put your trust in. And we're going to be the ones to fix this.\n\nOur economic relief policies will take care of fiscal matters. Now, it's time for Ireland's mental relief as well."
IRE_rte_history_broadcasts_desc:0 "The one advantage we have in this fight against the national malaise is that we can get everyone's attention. Sure, we could put up posters or billboards to ignore, or blast slogans from vans for people to not listen to, but we have something better. Because everyone in Ireland has at least a radio, if not a television set. And we have Raidió Teilifís Éireann, our national broadcaster.\n\nSoon, a new programming schedule will be put in place. One which will put an emphasis on historical dramas, documentaries, and programs with more of an emphasis on our triumphs and challenges. Viewers and listeners will tune in, and get the subtle hints about Ireland being a great country, with achievements of every sort. And that idea is going to lift them up from the gutters they find themselves in."
IRE_ulster_goodwill_tours_desc:0 "Stop thinking about the economy for a second, will you? Have you noticed the progress we have made in Ulster?\n\nWe have finally got the Protestants and Catholics talking. Things are clamped down tight. And we are closer to peace than ever. Just look at all the high-profile visits we can make without us getting ambushed! Peace is closer than ever, so regardless of what you think about the economy, at least the years of violence are finally coming to a close. And isn't that what really matters?"
IRE_the_presidents_visit_desc:0 "What the people need is something that can take their mind off of this disaster for a moment. Something that can take up time on the news. Something that can bring people out on the streets aside from the offer of soup or unemployment subsidies. And something truly momentous in the history of our young nation.\n\nWe will send a notice to Washington. Their President is humbly invited to visit Ireland for a historic tour of the nation, with visits to many points of interest. Some aid from America will also be requested. And at the end will be a hint that this might be good for improving his prospects amongst the sizable Irish diaspora in the United States. And if he accepts, we can have a week of grand occasions and celebrations that will make us more patriotic."
IRE_late_late_show_appearances_desc:0 "Of course, just broadcasting dramas set in the 1800's isn't going to get the people listening to our message. They want to stay informed, to know the people making the decisions. And we cannot just ignore that and rely on subtle and inferred messaging to get our point across. So why not take a direct approach?\n\nPoliticians will be encouraged to go on these new talk shows and even have televised debates. We will take our case directly to the people, and defend our policies on their merits. Mass media is here, and it won't be leaving anytime soon. Now, we will use it for our full advantage."
IRE_celtic_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Irish, the Bretons, the Welsh, and the Scottish. All nations descended from that legendary group of tribes so long ago. All nations that have recently been granted their liberty. And all nations left adrift by the recent turmoil on the continent. What if we started working together to plot our future course?\n\nOf course, any grand celtic alliance would be impossible at this point, given our unique governments, leanings, and domestic politics. But that doesn't mean we can't get a few diplomats from these countries in a room in Dublin and have them talk to each other in general terms. We don't have to come up with any firm commitments or specific plans for the future. The mere idea of a coordinated celtic future will make the people of these nations happy for this event."
IRE_meet_with_the_jews_desc:0 "With all this talk of sectarian fighting and violence between the faiths, it's easy to see Ireland as a case of Catholics against Protestants. But that isn't the case, and Ireland isn't so religiously binary as one may expect. We have a sizable Jewish community that has been mostly ignored and forgotten these past few years. And we should begin to remedy that.\n\nWe will start with a series of high-profile visits to Jewish synagogues and community centers. By highlighting them, we can begin to court their support. And if we show Ireland is home to faiths that can coexist with the rest, we may be able to begin an interfaith dialogue, and encourage some form of ecumenism in Ireland."
IRE_look_to_the_past_desc:0 "And we have one great and grand opportunity to accomplish all of our aims at once. To remind people of our history. To capture their attention away from the economic crash. And to bring a grand, unifying event to remind everyone of our shared Irish heritage. And events like these may truly be once in a lifetime.\n\nThe 50-year anniversary of the Easter Rising is coming up. The week that the armed insurrection against the British colonizers began, leading to our eventual independence and liberation. We must assemble a committee to begin planning for it. This will be the biggest event of the year, and we want to do it right."

After all, the hard-working Irish men and women of Ireland are the ones that make sure that the country works. With this new bill, we dedicate a considerable amount of our budget to subsidies for businesses to repay the effort made by the population. Local industries now have enough support to compete with the rest of Europe, but also producing more goods for our own people."
IRE_finance_bill_mod:0 "The Moderate Finance Bill"
IRE_finance_bill_mod_desc:0 "Supporting local businesses is important to maintain a competitive economy. This bill, however, goes one step further. Not only do we dedicate a good chunk of our budget to finance Irish industries but also we redirect money directed to German businesses towards them. As a result, we are less dependent on other countries for consumer goods. The Reich can't force us to ignore our fellow countrymen."
IRE_finance_bill_rad:0 "The Radical Finance Bill"
IRE_finance_bill_rad_desc:0 "Radical circumstances require radical solutions, especially to maintain the wellbeing of the Irish nation. Through this bill, we dedicate a portion of our budget, and the money destined to German businesses subsidize Irish businesses.

IRE_intro.1.t:0 ""Paternal" Autocracy"
IRE_intro.1.desc:0 "Seán Lemass found the lack of an official residence for the Taoiseach one of the most irritating quirks endemic to Irish politics. While even the Bulgarian monarch - his only independent counterpart at Einheitspakt meetings - could boast of a palace, he was stuck in his Dublin apartment.\n\nThere was at least one advantage to the housing situation: his son Noel. The poor bugger actually lived in the building, and carried out much the same tasks as Tsar Boris's servants. Whenever Lemass came home, he could find his dinner served and plates clean. Today, the meal wouldn't be just for him, but for Charles Haughey, too.\n\nWhile Lemass hoped that the night's discussion would not stray far away from Noel's soup, he had defeated his own expectations by veering into the Northern Counties situation while explaining the differences between stews in both parts of the country.\n\n"Blaneyyy..." Lemass's english had acquired a brewery accent. "If not for him and his... uh, what do you call them, Blaneyboys, yes." Another sip of beer graced the Taoiseach's throat. "Everything would have been fine after 61, but he had to insist on that fucking cabinet post. The liberals, too, you know, they helped ruin everything as well." Lemass's accusatory finger pointed vaguely in the direction of his son. "Noel, don't ever forget, giving into your enemies is a mistake. I allowed those pain-in-the-ass cosmopolites - Lynch and Corish - to cook up a deal with the Liberals, and look where it's got me! Now I have to bend over backwards every time I want to pass a goddamn bill."\n\nHaughey was in the process of interjecting with a deprecatory remark about the state of Fine Gael, but he didn't get far before Lemass started up again. "You know Charles, you are like a son to me. Apart from this boy here, you... you are the only man I can trust! I rely on you to save this party, no, this country!." While his thirty four year old son made a muttered protest against his description as a "boy," Charles Haughey quietly cringed. If the old man knew what was really going on."
IRE_intro.1.a:0 "Or maybe he did..."
IRE_intro.2.t:0 "The Situation"
IRE_intro.2.desc:0 "A few blocks away from Leinster House, Jack Lynch and Frank Aiken sipped on a fanta at the O'Shannessy cafe. "Christ, Jack, this German stuff tastes like shit."\n\nThe much younger Lynch had a stronger stomach, but couldn't disagree with the old dog opposite to him. "The drink or the treaty?" Aiken let out a laugh, before raising his hand, the waitress had come with the bread. As she put it down in table, Aiken's eyes widened with indignation.\n\n"What the fuck is this?. The young woman jumped back as Aiken examined the food. "Roggenbrot? What does this mean? Look at this crap, I could hit you over the head with this, its like a goddamn brick!" He turned towards the woman, "lady, can you bring us some decent bread." As the former cabinet minister screamed at her, the waitress tried to explain to him that there was no other type available, until Lynch intervened to calm Aiken down. While the girl managed to get away, Aiken didn't stop. "Those jerries, they are everywhere Jack. Even in food, why can't they leave us alone?"\n\n"Because Lemass won't stand up to them, and anyone who does ends up in a jail cell. You'd think that after how many votes the liberals and us got in the last election, he'd lay it off a bit, but since last year he's jailed 800 more. For fuck's sake, this man will drive Fianna Fáil to ruin."\n\n"Him and his buddy-in-need." Frank's euphemism for Neil Blaney got a hearty laugh out of Lynch. "I mean, its incredible Jack! Lemass puts the trade unionists in prison and damn-near sieg heils whenever Hitler dumps all of this crap into our economy, but those stupid bastards at the Labour Party keep propping up the government. We can't get rid of him either, not when the liberals keep saying they'll only support the coalition if he's still there."\n\n"The world is a mess... and we need to do something about it, Frank." Lynch sighed, if someone was going to lead liberalism back to the forefront, it was him, Frank was too old. Perhaps, Fianna Fáil was too old a vehicle to do it as well."
IRE_intro.2.a:0 "Its no good."
IRE_intro.3.t:0 "The Vanquished"
IRE_intro.3.desc:0 "James Dillon sat at his desk, filling out paperwork. It was always the same for him, being the last one inside the Fine Gael headquarters. His desk was surrounded by photos of him and many of the fellow members of the FG. He smiled before remembering the truth of the party. They hadn't won an election in twenty-two years. Longer than how old some of their party members have been alive for. He sighed and rubbed his temple. Twenty-Two long years of playing second fiddle to Fianna Fáil and the rest of Ireland. He looked at his watch, it was half-past eleven. James packed up his things into his briefcase before shutting off the lights and making his way to the main lobby.\n\nTo his surprise, Liam Cosgrave and Oliver Flanagan had pulled some chairs out and had been in the middle of a conversation before they saw James and waved him over. The men had been discussing mostly personal things, such as their families. The point of the Fianna Fáil had come up. Mostly the current issue with "liberals" as Liam and Oliver talked, James listened. Once the two men had finished, James spoke.\n\n"Well to be fair, I agree with both of you. Our time is coming. However, this is not the time to discuss this. Anyways, do you lot want to go to the pub?" asked James. The two men nodded and they walked out of the headquarters. On the way out, James thought to himself. He was going to retire soon, and Oliver seemed like the more qualified candidate. "He could do much more for Ireland than I", believed James."
IRE_intro.3.a:0 "And off they went."
IRE_intro.4.t:0 "A Special Zone for Special People"
IRE_intro.4.desc:0 "Far away from the busy streets of Belfast, the former Hillsborough Castle proudly flew the Irish tricolour. Converted into the main administrative office of the Northern Counties Ministry, it served as the residence of the province's governor: Neil Blaney.\n\nThe company of IDF men guarding the approaches thought it no surprise that a black Mercedes made its way to the building's guardhouse at noon that Friday, for it always did. Blaney's extra-official meetings with other members of the cabinet, far away from the Lemassite halls of power in Dublin, were a secret to no one.\n\nCharles Haughey, for his part, rather hoped their regular encounters would be more secret. Why exactly Lemass kept trusting him as he did when it was so well known he'd go up to the NCSZ every weekend was a mystery to him, and one that unsettled him more every day.\n\nAs soon as he got off his ministerial car, Haughey was quick to spot the grey-clad figure storming out the building, "Lieutenant Colonel Kelly, good afternoon." The IDF man opposite to him gave back a courteous remark, but ultimately continued on his way, Haughey knew it couldn't be good. He proceeded up the stairs of the Georgian construction, until he got to Blaney's office.\n\nThe Donegal TD, working at his desk, looked the same as always, albeit his hair seemed to have receded a bit more than Haughey remembered. His unmistakable gruff voice called out to Haughey shortly after he entered the room, "Hello, Charly." On his desk, a picture of a far younger Lt. Blaney in uniform, from the war.\n\n"How are you Neil, and by the way, what was Kelly doing here?" Haughey let his concern be expressed through the tone of his voice.\n\n"Jim Kelly came back talking all about his concerns over our friends... nothing to worry about, really.

Ranging from ones written by Plato to more modern books written by Thoreau. All of them had ideas that had stuck with de Valera. Photos had lined his work desk as well, many of them with his former friend, and now rival, Seán Lemass. The photo stung de Valera, made him remember things that hurt him. The pain of a friend turning on him with the whole Fianna Fial following. Their bastardly coalition with Labour, it all was going to ruin Ireland.\n\nDe Valera then decided to call Seán MacEntee to meet him in the office. While MacEntee's official abilities had been to serve the Taoiseach, he didn't interact that much with Lemass. So he was a perfect candidate for de Valera to talk to.\n\n"It just doesn't make sense Seán, how Lemass would just turn his back to me and take the whole party with it. I've become a ghost in politics, nothing more than a figurehead for the government. All of the power of the Taoiseach gone like that." Seán nodded along. "I sold the country to the Germans, thinking they would respect our boundaries. Instead, we got forced to be policed by them and forced into the so-called "Einheitspakt". Unity my arse." MacEntee tried to comfort da Valera after hearing him rant.\n\n"I don't think Ireland would forget you Éamon, your contributions to Ireland are eternal." Before Seán could continue, he checked the time and had to leave to meet Lemass. Alone, de Valera began to weep silently, hoping that he would not be forgotten."

"Time to close up, Tom," Adam told the one remaining patron still seated at the bar, "go home to your lovely wife and kids, I'm sure they miss you with all the time you spend here."\n\n"Fine, fine, I'll get out of your hair," Tom chuckled. "I'll tell Sarah you said hi, see you tomorrow."\n\nAdam shepherded Tom out into the cool night air. Tom was a decent fellow, all told. Kind hearted, hard working, went to church on Sundays. Not too well off, Adam supposed, but that was a lot of Ireland these days.\n\nThings weren't supposed to have been like this. His pa had fought in the war against the English when Adam was just a boy, and would always tell stories of how great Ireland would be when she reunited with her brothers in the north. That's all the televisions seemed to talk about: how great having the isle back together was for everybody, even if the Protestants in the north hadn't seemed to get the memo.\n\nLocking up for the night, Adam caught sight of a VW car puttering down the otherwise quiet street. Now if that wasn't a metaphor for Ireland's ills, Adam thought to himself. The damn Germans had swept into Ireland with their fancy promises and offers of assistance, but everybody but the damned Taoiseach knew that they were sucking the lifeblood out of the Irish people. Half the businesses in Dublin seemed to be German run these days, and people had even had the gall to ask if he stocked any of the piss the Germans had the audacity to call beer at his pub.\n\nAdam sighed as he walked down the street towards his home. He'd always loved his home, as any true Irishman would, but though he would never admit it, it grew harder and harder everyday to feel proud to call himself an Irishman."

Ireland was finally starting to get back on her feet it seemed, and the people were feeling the benefits. More and more people could afford to eat out or get a drink, and Adam himself was even able to afford to hire a proper cook so he could focus on the bar.\n\nTom and a few of his buddies were sitting at one end of the bar, chatting loudly among themselves. Tom was now considered a bit of a local hero after he organized a strike outside of one of those factories owned by that German bastard Josef Abs, and managed to get the whole damn country talking about worker safety. "How's about another round, Tom?" Adam shouted over the din. Tom raised his mug in acknowledgement, setting off a round of cheers among his fellows, all clamoring to pick up his tab. He hadn't paid for a beer in weeks.\n\nYes, Adam thought, things really were starting to look up for Ireland. Even the Paramilitaries in the north had quieted down some after their terrorist attack, though Adam knew better than to think that was anything more than the calm before the storm. Really, the only problem Ireland was left facing was the damn Germans.\n\nAdam frowned. Sure, the Taoiseach liked to talk about how the Irish were independent from the Reich, and had even introduced some legislation to back Irish businesses over German ones, but the big corporations in Germania still had their slimy tentacles all over Ireland. Factories owned by giant German companies still dotted the landscape, and Germany was the primary importer of Irish made goods. Too much of Ireland's economy was tied up in German hands, Adam reckoned.\n\nAdam was drawn from his reverie by a call for another round of drinks. Worrying about the Germans could come later; perhaps for now, they could enjoy a bit of peace and prosperity."

Fortunately, the left wing of our party has come up with plans to considerably expand upon the bill, in return they will offer additional support in passing it.\n\nOf course accepting these alterations will help us gather the vital votes required to pass this bill, yet we must first consider if this is worth angering the right of our party. Many of whom have already made it clear that they believe the bill is going too far to begin with. Cooperating with the Liberals and Labour will only make these deputies feel growingly more and more alienated from the rest of the government.\n\nIt is well known that the balance of power in the Dáil is a fine, and close fought, thing.

Yet with the left claiming that the bill is too moderate and the right denouncing it as too radical, it will be impossible for both sides to be appeased. Be that as it may, a hope has appeared in the form of the right wing of our party.\n\nSeveral De Valerist and Hardliner deputies have assured the powers that be that should the scope of the struggling bill be reduced, they will be able to help try and tip the balance of the vote in the government's favor. The proposition has proved tempting to those who wish to retain the support of the right within our ruling coalition. However, the same can not be said for the deputies further to the left, who will undoubtedly feel betrayed by the government's failure to pass the changes they believe to be a bare minimum.\n\nPassing a reduced bill may prove to only be a short term victory for the government, which perpetually remains at risk of fraying at the seams."

However, it is equally obvious that without the necessary adjustments the bill is doomed to fail.\n\nA decision must be made between saving the bill through embracing the right, or saving face with the left and losing yet another piece of important legislation.

You could have chosen to stay in Dublin, have an easy career... but you weren't interested. You are here to fight the good fight - solve cases, right wrongs - very well then, but Ulster isn't pretty. There's no sitting on a fence. You have to choose sides. Take a brown paper envelope to look over all of the corrupt filth that goes on in Blaney's backyard, or look behind your back every five minutes in fear of a prot or a provo trying to murder you."\n\nInspector Eamon Doherty pondered on the words which the Chief Superintendent of the Garda's Northern Counties department had left him with two months earlier. Truth be told, he'd transferred to Belfast for the pay raise: His daughter was getting married soon, and paying for weddings wasn't cheap. Perhaps, he thought, there was an element of careerism to it as well: Yes, success in cases here would make him friends back in Dublin, there was nothing wrong with that.\n\nWhatever his motivations, Doherty had come to the conclusion they weren't worth it. The counties which Doherty once helped unify as a volunteer during the war were a mess. The Northern Ireland Constabulary, themselves supposedly part of the Garda, were unreliable as all hell and each day came with a new terrorist attack from some deranged faction or the other. Today was no exception, either. Dawn had barely broken when his presence was requested by radio: Another car bombing.\n\nParking his german-made patrol car alongside the much older models of the Northern Ireland Constabulary, Doherty got out of the Daimler, and headed to see the crisp remains of a Morris Oxford, cordoned off by a dozen policemen. "Who was it?" The inspector glanced at the NIC patrolman closest to the vehicle.\n\n"Ruairi O Bradaigh, a Saor Éire bigshot." By the scorn in his voice, Doherty could tell the man was a protestant. "Where do you want to start? There's a few witnesses to talk to, but you could also take a look at the car registration first, or try searching for something meaningful in the rubble."
 IRE_investigations.1.a:0 "Let's go check the remains."

 IRE_investigations.2.t:0 "Inspecting the Remains"
 IRE_investigations.2.desc:0 "Eamon Doherty stepped around the bombed-out hull of the car. It was covered in black soot and the doors had been blown off. He tried to find anything that would tell him why it was done. However all he saw were destroyed seats and a steering wheel stuck in a tree. 	It was the work of terrorists, he could tell as the bottom of the car had been blown up. Across the road, a few officers had been in the process of trying to clean off and decipher the license plate.\n\n"Car bomb" he muttered to himself as he walked around. Something kept nagging him in the back of his head. He knew that the IRA was basically gone, and the Ulsterite groups weren't that bold to bomb a car in broad daylight. However it if it was Ulsterites it made sense. They didn't even know who the poor sap was. Didn't matter now anyway, they had a job to do. He knew it was going to be hard to find something with evidence. So far they had found a half shoe, with the other half being destroyed. As Eamon did another lap around the car, something caught his eye. On the ground, reflecting off the sun was a pair of glasses. Eamon stopped in his tracks and put on gloves, picking up the glasses and putting them in a small bag. As he walked back to his car, he noticed witnesses being asked questions by police officers. They had been assembled a little way down the road.\n\nAs he got into his car, he gave himself a dilemma. He could either phone the station to try and find a connection to the car using the license plate. It was an older model but should still check out. Eamon could also help with the interrogation, however, he could be seen as unwanted due to his presence. Either way, he was going to find out why the bombing occurred. "
 IRE_investigations.2.a:0 "Let's ring the station."

 IRE_investigations.3.t:0 "Hello, Operator"
 IRE_investigations.3.desc:0 ""Yes, I'd like to be connected to the central police station, yes that one please," said Eamon Doherty to the operator on the other side of the line. He was starting to sweat inside the small telephone booth that was located on the street. Unlike the more open ones of Dublin, the ones in Ulster had been much smaller. A product of the past he thought to himself. He waited for a few moments to be connected. Luckily for him, he had enough change that was given to him from the station to keep the line alive for the next half hour.\n\n"Eamon? Aren't you in the middle of an investigation?" asked the officer on the line.\n\n"I am, Luke. However, I found some evidence that could possibly solve this bombing faster. A pair of glasses and the license plate number. It had been blown half down the street, but it was thankfully in one piece. I want to see if you can find the car in the national registry. The number is I5I-KY-1568," Eamon requested. The line was silent for about 10 minutes, he heard papers flip periodically before Luke responded.\n\n"I got the name of the bloke, an older car it seems. Belonged to a dead member of Saor Éire, it says he died two years ago. Seemed to be quite the leader. We definitely have information here at headquarters on him if you wanna drop by," said Luke, trying to be helpful.\n\n"If I think of it I will. Thanks" Said Eamon as he hung up. He then muttered under his breath. If the Saor Éire was involved this could seem to be a much larger issue, especially if Bradaigh and car are connected. "

 IRE_investigations.4.t:0 "The Witness"
 IRE_investigations.4.desc:0 ""Joseph McCarran correct?" asked Eamon. The man sitting across from him simply grunted and turned his head away. The questioning had been difficult so far, with the man simply refusing to answer at times, especially when it came to his occupation and what he was doing when the bomb went off.\n\n"Well, he'd always walked the same route every day, I was turned around, about to go inside my house before I heard the explosion. Next thing I knew, a car had gone up in flames, and poor Bradigah was dead," said McCarran, sounding nervous as sweat dripped down his face.\n\n"Do you know who this plate belongs to?" Eamon placed the plate from the car onto the table. Immediately McCarran began to look around. Before looking at the plate and shugging, saying he's never seen the car before. Eamon thought in his head, time to play the mean cop.\n\n"You sure about that? I assume you know what happens if we find out that you had lied to an officer?" said Eamon, trying to intimidate McCarran who looked around one more time before leaning in close.\n\n"Please, look behind you. I'm being forced to do this, I beg you," McCarran said this as his eyes darted around the street. Eamon turned and immediately saw figures watching them, as soon as he met his eyes with the one in the front, they broke off and got into a car.\n\n"Bastards!" Yelled Eamon as he barked orders at another officer to continue the questioning as he raced to his car and radioed into headquarters. This day just got a hell of a lot more interesting thought Eamon. "

 IRE_investigations.5.t:0 "Law and Order on the Streets of Belfast"
 IRE_investigations.5.desc:0 "The car weaved through the streets of Belfast, recklessly dodging traffic and swerving around pedestrians with only the barest regard for safety. Eamon followed closely behind in his patrol car, sirens flashing, and taking a little more care to avoid harming any bystanders. He was forced to duck a couple times when one of the escaping suspects fired a pistol at his car, but their aim thankfully proved to be piss-poor.\n\nThe chase ended suddenly when the front of the fleeing car wrapped itself around a light pole. Both escapees staggered out of the wrecked automobile, one bleeding heavily from a cut on the head, and found shelter in the back room of a bookstore. As for Eamon, he knew that it would be suicide to go in there alone, so he waited outside the alley with his service pistol drawn and called for reinforcements.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, half a dozen Garda officers arrived, cordoning off the area and pointing weapons at the door. The shooters were silent to demands shouted by the Garda over the megaphone, and they made no demands of their own. Just while the officers considered sending someone in, the door flew open and out barreled one of the shooters, armed and bellowing wildly. He managed to hit one officer in the arm before being felled by the hail of bullets. As for the other, it appeared he bled out from his injuries.\n\nTwo days later, a file appeared on Eamon's desk: the autopsies of the two dead shooters. They had no IDs on them, but prison dental records proved illuminating: both men were Catholic and had ties to Saor Éire and the IRA, not the UDF."

 IRE_investigations.6.t:0 "Confirmation Bias"
 IRE_investigations.6.desc:0 ""Joseph McCarran, correct?" asked Eamon. The man sitting across from him simply grunted and turned his head away.

Next thing I knew, the car had gone up in flames, and poor Ó Bradaigh was dead. It's all I know, swear on Jesus, Mary, and Joseph." As much as he thought that McCarran was lying, Eamon unfortunately lacked anything that suggested otherwise.\n\nAfter thanking McCarran for his time (which was met with a "now piss off"), Eamon tried to compile all the information he gathered. The site of the bombing itself, the make and model of the car, McCarran's testimony... something just wasn't adding up. But that was something for people with a far higher pay rate than him to determine. At last, Eamon wrote down the conclusion of his report:"

##Investigation 2

 IRE_investigations.11.t:0 "Sectarian Violence and Its Consequences"
 IRE_investigations.11.desc:0 ""Get the fuck back!" The Garda officer swung his billy club at the crowd of angry protestants, driving them away with the rest of his men. Inspector Doherty lay on the ground, trying to process what had happened. He had been trying to take a look at the scene after he hopped out of the police car, and was busy trying to take stock of the crime scene when some of the crowd had broken through the police lines and hit him on the back of the head. They had been kicking up until the point where the Garda had saved him.\n\n"You alright, Inspector?" asked the Garda Lieutenant as he ran over. "If we hadn't showed up when we did, the proddy bastards would have you strung up on a tree!"\n\nDoherty took the hand. "Wouldn't have blamed them if they did," he said as he pulled himself up. "I mean, look at this mess. It's the Battle of Glenshane Pass here. I can't imagine what would be done if something like this happened in Dublin."\n\nIndeed, it was a disaster. The pub had been shot up from the outside, and there were bodies there, hunched over or on the floor. One or two people had been unlucky enough to be standing on the sidewalk when the attack happened, and they were lying several feet up the road. Given the makeup of the neighborhood, Doherty was certain the victims would turn out to be protestants, though the police would make sure to check.\n\nBefore he was attacked, the inspector had just arrived on the scene and was going to start checking the site. Since the population was not going to be cooperative on this one, this case would come down to his analysis. He started by inspecting the site the shooters started from."
 IRE_investigations.11.a:0 "There are plenty of shell casings around here. . ."

 IRE_investigations.12.t:0 "Following a Bullet's Path"
 IRE_investigations.12.desc:0 "Another one. Inspector Doherty leaned down, and picked up the cartridge by inserting his pen into the hole where the bullet had been, lifting it up. He took a closer look at it. "Same as the others," he said to himself, before placing it into an evidence bag. There were plenty of cartridges and bullets around, but he had seen enough of them to make a conclusion.\n\n"Lieutenant?" he called out to the man from Military Intelligence. "Got a bag of Thirty-Eight Smith and Wesson for you. I think our suspects were using English revolvers. The Brits had those during the war, we used Four-Fifty-Five Webley in our sidearms then."\n\n"My God. . ." said the Lieutenant. "Does this mean it's a false-flag attack?"\n\nThis was an unexpected conclusion. "What?" asked Doherty in disbelief.\n\n"The English are behind this, for sure then," said the Lieutenant. "They supplied the weapons for this attack, this means they're behind it. Are they doing IRA attacks on the Protestants to rile them up? This might be part of their plan for a takeover!"\n\n"Don't be daft," said Doherty. "They just used English ammunition, that's all. And we used English ammunition ourselves for quite a time. It doesn't mean a conspiracy when someone uses Smith and Wesson."\n\n"But you know these things do happen," said the Lieutenant. "I know you don't really believe the war started with the Gleiwitz incident, inspector."\n\nThis was a ludicrous theory, thought the inspector at first. But. . .so many crazy things had happened in the world, it did have a shred of possibility."

 IRE_investigations.13.desc:0 ""You're out of your damn mind, Doherty!" declared Commissioner Collins. "This can't be the only thing you're offering me here!"\n\n"It makes sense," insisted Inspector Doherty. "The attack happened with English weapons, and the nation with the greatest amount of English weapons is England. The IRA is being funded and supported by them, and this is a false-flag operation. You have to work with me on this, Commissioner."\n\n"Every bloody day, more Protestants are attacked! Yesterday, a Football Supporter's Club was shot up. And the only lead you have is the same English ammunition! This isn't working, Doherty, the city is breathing down my neck, telling me to find a solution and get someone behind bars. You need a suspect named and fast!"\n\n"It's not that simple," maintained Doherty, "this is a matter of national security, and they have to be told that."\n\n"I can't tell them some half-baked theory about the English! Your theory better start producing results and fast, because we're being pushed to the breaking point here in Belfast.""

 IRE_investigations.14.desc:0 ""You made the front page of the London Times," said Commissioner Collins, coldly.\n\n"What?" asked Inspector Doherty.\n\n"Your theory got out to the press, through military intelligence, and they had a field day with it. Now, London's outraged, and they are going to demand an explanation, and an apology. And Dublin has no choice but to give it to them. They don't have a shred of evidence to stand on aside from your theory. And now, Military Intelligence and every Irish police officer has egg on his face."\n\nDoherty was stunned. "So, what does this mean for the case?"\n\n"This case? This case is over, inspector. We can't move at all with only a theory that can't be proven, and one which is diplomatically impossible to follow up on. No arrests, multiple casualties, and a massive diplomatic fuckup. That's how this case is closed."\n\nCollins signed, then continued, "You fucked up Doherty, and your union is the only thing stopping me from taking your badge right here!"\n\nA long silence.

 IRE_investigations.15.desc:0 ""The .38/100 is a common cartridge," said Gerard Byrne, head of ballistics over the noise of the lunchtime crowd at the pub. "I wouldn't say it's impossible to source a revolver that uses it from a civilian source, but the most common one that uses it around here would be a British Webley or Enfield."\n\n"So where might the IRA have acquired it?" asked Inspector Doherty as he took a bite of his Tomato Farcie. "From England itself?"\n\nByrne shook his head. "England doesn't have so many stocks of those guns anymore. The vast majority of them were destroyed as part of disarmament during the postwar. Even with the switch to automatic pistols, they still keep their hands on every weapon they can get. The only source would be some stock of weapons kept as war trophies by an army similarly lacking in armaments." He took a bite out of his sandwich. "So, the Irish Army is storing a bunch of decommissioned ones from 1944 in a warehouse."\n\n"Is it worth taking a look at, then?" asked Doherty. "Some clerk might be letting some slip on the side."\n\n"Most likely, yes. That's the only source I know of, and it's most likely the one you're looking for. I say go in, check the books, and come back with a few addresses to knock on.""

 IRE_investigations.16.desc:0 "As Inspector Doherty and his men prepared to raid the warehouse holding the revolvers, the sound of approaching trucks got their attention. Several vehicles, all with army markings, passed by them. A small staff car in the middle parked in front of the Garda and a man in the uniform of an Army Captain stepped out.\n\n"Inspector Doherty?" he asked. "I'm Colonel James Kelly, Military Intelligence. Your investigation has now been transferred to me. This is a case of national security, and we'll be the ones to prosecute it."\n\n"You're taking it over?" asked Doherty. "The same people who leaked the guns in the first place? You expect me to believe this isn't some sort of cover-up?"\n\n"You're off the case, inspector. Now, are you going to stand there all night, or do you want me to get my men to remove you?"\n\nFor a hot moment, both men stared at each other. Doherty momentarily thought about the weight of his sidearm on his waist, and started considering if he should pull it out.\n\nThen, another Garda officer grabbed his arm. "It isn't worth it, Eamon," he said. "Come on, let's go back to the station."\n\nDoherty followed him, giving the smug Captain a quick glance before going back to his car."

##Investigation 3

 IRE_investigations.21.desc:0 "It was a sunny day in the Northern Irish countryside when he got the call. Something big had happened in a tiny village called Whitecross, and it had headquarters all up in arms. Inspector Doherty had gotten the call to come in as he was preparing for his daughter's wedding, a fact he was not very happy about. Unfortunately, the job had to come first.\n\nDoherty arrived at the scene, pulling up to the side of the road. Police units had cordoned off a significant part of the street, and were holding back a small but growing crowd of onlookers, likely a significant part of the tiny village. Waving his badge at one of the police officers, he made his way through the crowd into the clearing.\n\nOne of the men surveying the site noticed his entry. "You Eamon Doherty?" the man asked.\n\n"Inspector Eamon Doherty, of Garda Siochana. I was called in for something, what's the situation?"\n\nThe man held out his hand for Doherty to shake. "Officer James Flanagan, North Ireland Constabulary. It's a right mess out here, four officers of the army were killed in a roadside bombing."\n\n"Shit." Doherty swore.\n\n"Shit is right. The military is pissed, and we've gotta play this safe. The military wanted to conduct the investigation themselves, and it took a lot of convincing to get them to let us do it instead."\n\n"Alright, so what do we have so far?" Doherty asked.\n\n"Well, we think it was the Ulster Volunteer Force," Flanagan answered, "But we don't have any solid evidence to prove that yet. We have a number of witnesses who are being held to answer some questions, and then there's the bodies themselves. There's not a whole lot left of them, but you might be able to glean something if you look hard enough. It's your show inspector, just let us know if there's anything you need."\n\nDoherty took a moment to ponder before he came to his decision."

 IRE_investigations.22.t:0 "Compelling the Witness"
 IRE_investigations.22.desc:0 "Questioning the witnesses had been unproductive thus far. No one had seen much of anything of note, and people were all offering speculation on what had happened rather than anything concrete.\n\n"I didn't see much, it all happened so fast," one had claimed.\n\n"I just know it was those proddy bastards," said another, "only one'a them would have been so bold! I don't have any proof, but I know it's true."\n\nOne had said something useful, however. "I heard the attackers shout something outta their car as they ran away, but I couldn't make out what was said." the witness had said. He pointed out a young man, maybe seventeen or eighteen, lingering on the edge of the crowd. "He was a lot closer to the attack, he might have heard something."\n\nTalking to the young man, however, had been less than successful.\n\n"I told you, I didn't see anything." the young man protested.\n\n"You were the closest one to the attack when it happened," Doherty retorted, "you can't possibly have seen nothing. Four men are dead, and you're the only one in the entire village who would be close enough to see what happened."\n\nThe young man was silent for a minute, arms crossed against his chest. "Like I said, officer," he said, unable to meet Doherty's eyes, "I didn't see anything."\n\nDoherty walked away, going to confer with Officer Flanagan. "It's obvious the kid knows something."\n\nFlanagan nodded. "The only question is why he won't talk."\n\nDoherty thought to himself. The kid either sympathised with the protestants, or he was too afraid to talk. Accusing the kid of sympathising with the attack would certainly be inflammatory, but it might scare him into talking. On the other hand, coddling the kid might not convince him if he really did sympathise with the attack, but promises of safety might make him feel comfortable enough to testify."

"But," he stammered, "I- I'm not-"\n\n"Hey!" shouted one of the onlookers, a woman in her forties. "You leave Johnny alone, he's no proddy sympathiser you bastard!\n\nAnother bystander, a man this time, shouted, "He's Catholic you ninny; he's an altar boy at St. Lukes!"\n\nA third bystander spoke up, this time a young woman, shouting, "He's a good boy, leave him alone!"\n\nThe dull murmurs of the crowd began to rise into shouting and jeers, and the police officers that had been keeping them back all this time were starting to look nervous. "I think it's time to get out of here, we're never going to get any more information out of them with the crowd like this, and if we try to arrest the kid we're gonna get lynched." said Officer Flanagan. Doherty nodded, and the two made their way from the increasingly belligerent crowd.\n\nDoherty sighed as they reached his car. "Headquarters is going to be pissed that we didn't get the information from that kid."\n\n"Not much you can do about it I'm afraid," offered Flanagan, "still, it's a pretty safe bet that it was the Ulster Volunteer Force that carried out the attack. We'll have to work under that assumption for now, hopefully it'll keep the military off our backs."\n\n"I just wish we had something more concrete," replied Doherty.

"I may have heard something," he said hesitantly. "The attackers, I heard them shout something at the officers before the attackers lobbed the bomb at them. 'Take that, you fascist fucking Greenshirts,' I think it was. Another shouted about the attack being the 'will of the working people made manifest,' or something. Do you know what that means officer?"\n\nDoherty snapped his fingers. "Yeah," he said, "I think I do know what that means."\n\nThanking the young man for his help, Doherty walked over to confer with Flanagan. "Get anything good from the kid?" Flanagan asked.\n\nDoherty nodded. "It wasn't the Ulster Volunteer Force."\n\n"So who was it then if it wasn't those losers?" Flanagan responded.\n\n"It was Saor Éire," Doherty said, "the kid said he heard them spout off a couple of left wing slogans before they attacked the officers. The Ulster Volunteer Force wouldn't care all that much who they voted for in the last election. The Saor Éire, on the other hand, now they just might."\n\n"You think?" asked Flanagan.\n\n"I know," responded Doherty. "It's the Saor Éire. It has to be. I need to call headquarters, phone this in. Do you think you can get me a telephone?"\n\nDoherty was led back out through the now dispersing crowd towards a payphone.

The service had been wonderful, a traditional Catholic wedding, and his new son-in-law was a charming young man; Doherty had no doubt that the young man would make the new bride very happy.\n\nHe watched his daughter, laughing and dancing in the middle of the ballroom floor. He would have joined her, if he wasn't getting so damned old. The party seemed like it was starting to wrap up anyways; everyone had their fill of food and drink, and it was starting to get very late.\n\nHis daughter caught his eyes, and she smiled at him, making her way over to embrace him.

"I wouldn't have missed it for the world," he responded, just as softly. He knew in his heart that he had made the right choice.\n\nAs his daughter wandered away to go and mingle with the crowd once more, Doherty felt a tap on his shoulder from one of the venue's staff. "Mr. Doherty? There's a man on the phone for you."\n\nThe staff member led him to a telephone in the entryway of the building. "Inspector Doherty," he said into the receiver.\n\n"Doherty? Where the fuck are you? Why did you leave Whitecross?" shouted his captain.\n\n"Captain?" Doherty asked, "I'm at my daughters wedding, I was going to resume the investigation tomorrow-"\n\n"There is no more damned investigation!" the captain roared, "The military is furious that you left; they're taking over the investigation now. Last I heard, they've started rounding up random fucking protestants in the streets! Do you know what this means Doherty?"\n\nDoherty held the phone limply in his arm, the fury of his captain rolling over him in a wave. There was only one thought left in the inspector's mind."

 IRE_investigations.28.desc:0 "A cool mist descends upon the sleepy village of Whitecross. Nearby there is a roadway named Kingsmill, where twenty one Protestants from the surrounding areas have been rounded up by the forces of the Irish Army into hastily constructed wire fences. Soon, they will be herded into busses bound for Belfast, where the Army will conduct a thorough investigation. They pray to anyone who might listen for deliverance, though the smarter among them know that they will likely never see the light of day again.\n\nThere is one among the group of Protestants who is only nineteen years old, a man barely out of his youth. "I have a plan," he says, "We all know how this is going to end if we don't get out of here. There are only ten soldiers guarding us, we outnumber them two to one. When they come back, we overpower them, steal their guns and their truck, and we get out of Ireland."\n\n"It will never work," says a second. "If we comply, we might make it out alive. If this doesn't work we're not going to."\n\n"This is our only option," argues the first, "We're not going to get out of this unless we take matters into our own hands."\n\nThe time comes. "Out!" orders one of the guards, and they come out one by one. The brave young man feints compliance, and then rushes one of the soldiers, struggling with him for his weapon. There is a bang and a scream, and the young man feels pain like he's never felt before, like a molten lance through his side.\n\n"You stupid proddy fuck!" the guard shouts, "You fuck!" The man feels another blinding surge of pain as the soldier kicks him in the head. "You're going to fucking pay for that!"\n\nAnother soldier speaks up. "They're more trouble than they're worth," he argues, "We're better off just killing them."\n\nThe soldiers are in agreement. There is a bang, a scream, and once more the blood of the innocent waters the grasses of Eire."

 IRE_investigations.29.desc:0 "The reports had come in rapidly: there had been an explosion at the Stormont, the Northern Irish parliament building in Belfast, sometime early in the morning. N.I.C. units had responded quickly, and had realized that it was not an accident, but a deliberate attack. The building wasn't badly damaged, Inspector Doherty observed, arriving on the scene; some windows were blown out on the ground floor, but the structure itself remained stable. Past the police barricade where the inspector had parked, he could see Garda officers, N.I.C., and military personnel milling about outside of the building in a way that made it clear: things were balancing on a knife's edge.\n\nGetting out of his car, Doherty spotted a familiar face in the crowd. "Officer Flanagan!" he shouted, striding over to the man.\n\nFlanagan turned at hearing his name, and his face lit up. "Inspector Doherty!" the man responded, "We've got to stop meeting like this." Shaking the man's hand, Doherty followed him towards the parliament building. "Thanks for coming in, it's good to have someone I can trust on this investigation. We've been coordinating with Military Intelligence on this one." The two approached a familiar looking man in army fatigues. "Inspector Doherty, this is-"\n\n"Colonel James Kelly," ground out Doherty through clenched teeth, "We've met."\n\n"Brigadier General Kelly now," The man grunted, "I trust that you're enough of a professional to work with me on this?" He didn't wait for an answer. "Good, I want you to go interview some of the TD's caught in the attack. Dismissed."\n\n"Like I said, it's good to have someone I can trust here," said Flanagan, watching Kelly walk away. "We've been waiting for a full inspector to get here before we looked at the bomb site. Now that you're here, we could take a look at the damage first. What do you want to do?""

 IRE_investigations.30.desc:0 "Shattered glass crunched underfoot as Doherty and Flanagan walked through the entryway of parliament building, flanked by a veritable army of forensic investigators. Doherty could see shrapnel embedded in the walls and floors of the entrance hall, and walked carefully to avoid disturbing anything that could be used as evidence. Around them, the forensics crew took pictures of the room from various angles, hoping to find out what exactly had happened.\n\n"Inspector, come look at this," called Flanagan from across the room, "There's bullet casings."\n\nDoherty walked over to Flanagan and knelt down to look. He hadn't heard anything about gunfire at the parliament building, surely someone would have reported that sooner. Putting on disposable gloves, he picked up one of the bullet casings. "These are 7.92x57mm bullets, government issue," he noted, "If I didn't know any better I'd say these were fired out of an NF LAG, but those aren't exactly easy to come by. How would the attackers get their hands on one?"\n\nFlanagan frowned. "You think something's rotten in the state of Denmark, inspector?"\n\n"I think," Doherty muttered, "that there's something awfully strange about this attack."\n\nFlanagan glanced up out of the broken windows. "Hey, look at that," he said, "Looks like that Kelly fellow's off someplace."\n\nDoherty looked up. Sure enough, the Brigadier General was wandering off past the barricade the Garda had set up. He looked completely innocent. In fact, he was a textbook example of what to do when trying to not look conspicuous, which in of itself seemed suspicious. It could have been something innocuous, Doherty assumed, but he had a gut feeling that something was off about the entire affair. Why would the Brigadier General wander off in the middle of an important investigation? Something wasn't quite right, and Doherty had a feeling that Kelly had all the answers."

 IRE_investigations.31.desc:0 ""I need you to tell me what you saw during the attack," Doherty told the man in the ambulance.\n\nJohn Kirkpatrick, a TD of the Irish Labour party was sat on the back of an ambulance, being attended by a paramedic. He was young by Doherty's estimation, no older than about 25 years old. The man had a harrowed look about him, something that Doherty completely understood. With his many years in the Garda, Doherty understood how frightening confronting one's own mortality could be. Nevertheless, Doherty needed the man to recall the horror of his experiences in order to get to the bottom of what happened. It was one of the parts he liked the least about his job.\n\nThe TD in question shifted in his seat, unable to meet the inspector's eyes. "I didn't see very much per say, everything happened so quickly. I was off in a side office, so I never saw the attackers. All I heard was a big explosion, and then gunfire."\n\n"Gunfire? You're sure?" asked Doherty.\n\n"I'm absolutely certain, inspector," responded the TD.\n\nDoherty left the man to be attended to, instead turning towards Flanagan. "No one mentioned gunfire when I was called in. You'd think that it would be important to mention."\n\nFlanagan hummed, "Say, isn't that Kelly over there? Where's he going?"\n\nDoherty followed Flanagan's gaze. Sure enough, the Brigadier General was wandering off past the barricade the Garda had set up. He looked completely innocent. In fact, he was a textbook example of what to do when trying to not look conspicuous, which in of itself seemed suspicious. It could have been something innocuous, Doherty assumed, but he had a gut feeling that something was off about the entire affair.

 IRE_investigations.32.t:0 "A Meeting at the Docks"
 IRE_investigations.32.desc:0 "Doherty and Flanagan followed Kelly through the streets of Belfast by car. The Brigadier General had taken a winding route through the city, taking turns seemingly at random seemingly without a clear destination in mind, eventually arriving at the Belfast dockyards. Doherty and Flanagan parked a ways away, watching the man get out of his car and look around furtively. In a nearby alleyway a group of men stood hidden in the shadows. Kelly seemed to notice them and walked over.\n\n"Is that Neil Blaney over there?" asked Flanagan.\n\nDoherty examined the group again. It was hard to make out much of the group, as they were quite a distance away, but it certainly did look like the head of the Hardliners in Dublin was hanging around shady alleyways at the Belfast docks. Kelly snapped into a sharp salute that Blaney somewhat lazily returned. One of the men in the group that Doherty couldn't quite make out jerked his head in the direction of one of the warehouses, which the group went into.\n\n"What do we do now inspector? Do we go in after them?" Flanagan asked.\n\nDoherty thought for a moment. Something was wrong with the attack. Parliament was bombed in broad daylight and no one was able to report an attacker. In addition, there was gunfire from an unknown assailant that had not reported until he personally found out. Soldiers or Garda that may have been tasked with defending the building were seemingly absent during the attack, as none had been seriously injured or reported anything out of place. How did the attackers manage to get away unscathed in the middle of a major city? All questions that he didn't have the answers to, but he would bet that the answers were being discussed in that warehouse.\n\nAnd there was nothing Inspector Doherty could do about it.\n\n"Inspector?" prompted Flanagan.\n\n"We do nothing," muttered Doherty, "There's nothing we can do about this right now.""

Now, the two men were seated in Doherty's home in Belfast, saying Grace with his wife and children.\n\n"This smells lovely Martha, thank you so much for having me for dinner." Flanagan said, raising his head.\n\n"Of course," replied Doherty's wife, "Any friend of James is a friend of ours, and is welcome in this house."\n\n"So pa, did you catch any bad guys today?" asked 12 year old Lelaine, the younger of his two girls still living at home.\n\n"Let papa eat, Lelaine," responded the older one. Sophie was 16, and spoke with the level of snark only a teenage girl could muster. "You can badger him about work after he's had some of his supper.\n\n"Girls," chuckled Doherty, "There's no need to fight about this-"\n\nFlanagan was cut off by the squeal of breaking tires from outside. Doherty turned to look towards the window, and with a loud bang the front door was blown off its hinges. "Get down!" Doherty shouted, as guns began firing in from the street. Lelaine screamed as bullets whizzed past their heads, destroying flowerpots and tiles on the walls. Doherty grabbed Lelaine and pulled her in, pulling the table down in front of them. Flanagan managed to grab the other two and pull them out of harm's way. Lelaine had gone pale, clutching at her side weakly as blood stained the front of her blouse. Doherty pushed her hands out of the way and pressed firmly on the bullet wound, seeing red.\n\nMercifully, the bullets stopped overhead and the squeal of tires once again filled the night air. Flangan came thundering past through the front door, pistol drawn. "Flanagan!" Doherty shouted, pleading. "Call an Ambulance, Lelaine's been hit!""
 IRE_investigations.33.a:0 "Stay with me Lelaine, please!"

 IRE_investigations.34.t:0 "Planning the Raid"
 IRE_investigations.34.desc:0 "Inspector Doherty sat in a conference room along with officer Flanagan, Commissioner Patrick Collins, various fellow Garda officers and a team of forensic analysts. It had been a long night for the inspector, his and officer Flanagan's families had been taken into protective custody, and Lelaine had been rushed to a hospital, though much to Doherty's relief her condition had been declared stable. Still, the bastards had the audacity to attack his home and his family and put his little girl in the hospital. Doherty found himself angrier than he had ever been before. This could not go unpunished.\n\n"I want a raid," demanded Doherty, "I want a raid on the motherfuckers who decided to attack my family."\n\n"Don't worry inspector, we're not going to let an assault on one of ours go unanswered," responded the commissioner, "The only trouble is we need to find out who to raid. What information do we have on the attackers?" he addressed the room.\n\nOne of the analysts spoke up, "The attack on the Doherty household was likely conducted by the same culprit as the attack lead on the Stormont building this morning; the method of attack is the same in both cases. Another note is the shrapnel found at the scene. We believe that it's the same type of bomb that was responsible for the death of Ruairí Ó Bradaigh; it's likely the two attacks were linked. We can also safely assume that it was not the SE; they've been active in the countryside and don't have the resources necessary to commit to such a large attack in Belfast."\n\nDoherty thought for a moment. He had been assigned to the Ó Bradaigh case back in 1962. Whoever had been responsible for that would be the one who they should target. On the other hand, the similarities could be a mere coincidence, or even have been used to keep suspicion away from the true culprit."

"This is the Garda!" he shouted, "Everybody put your hands up!"\n\nThere were still a number of people in the church despite the early hour of the morning. A few of them shot to their feet in alarm, but the majority simply remained in their seats and raised their hands. A man in a priest's garb came thundering down the aisle towards Doherty as Garda officers filed in behind him. "What is the meaning of this?" the priest shouted.\n\nGarda officers marched through the church, pistols drawn, dragging the early morning churchgoers to their feet and demanding identification papers, arresting those who failed to produce the requested documents. "I'm looking for Ian Paisley," Doherty said.\n\n"You've found him," said the priest, "I ask again, what on earth is the meaning of this?"\n\n"Ian Paisley," Doherty said, "You are under arrest for terrorism against both the Republic of Ireland and officers of the Garda."\n\n"That's ridiculous, terrorism?" Paisley said, "I have no idea what you're talking about!" Two garda officers flanked him and handled him roughly, pulling his hands behind his back and handcuffing him.\n\n"Inspector!" shouted one of the Garda officers from the head of the church, "Inspector, there's nothing here."\n\n"What do you mean there's nothing here?" asked Doherty, incredulous.\n\n"Just that, inspector. There's nothing, no guns, no bombs, no plans, nothing to tie the UVF to the attacks. It wasn't them, we have to let these people go."\n\nOutside a crowd began to form. Doherty paled. If they hadn't been responsible, it meant that he had just aggravated the highest echelons of the UVF for nothing in broad daylight. This would be a disaster. Doherty looked around, seeing the struggling Paisley, the shocked churchgoers, and the angry crowd outside, and had only one word to say."

 IRE_investigations.36.t:0 "An Anonymous Tip"
 IRE_investigations.36.desc:0 "The table was silent at Doherty's declaration. "Well," one of the Garda officers said, "That's all well and good, but we know next to nothing about the IRA. We don't know who their leader is, where they operate, or where they even are. As much as we can sit here and say 'oh, let's go and raid the IRA,' we don't even know what to hit!"\n\nThe room mulled over that thought for a moment. "Actually, sir," one of the junior analysts spoke up, "That might not be true."\n\nThe commissioner glared at the analyst. "Explain," he grunted.\n\n"Well sir, we received an anonymous tip this morning, sometime between the attack on the parliament building and the attack on the Doherty household. The tip alleges that there's a hidden IRA safehouse within Belfast, in a warehouse down at the docks of Belfast, near the twin west silos. Allegedly the tipster had seen what he called 'shady fellows' going in and out of the warehouse late at night wearing IRA colors, bringing in packages of something, he wasn't sure what. I didn't bring it up earlier because it didn't seem very accurate, a warehouse within the city? But after the two attacks, it's more likely that the person who called this in was onto something," responded the analyst.\n\nDoherty and Flanagan glanced at each other. A hidden warehouse down by the docks full of shady people sounded awfully familiar to the both of them. Could it be the same warehouse that they had seen Neil Blaney and Brigadier General Kelly walk into? "I think that the tip might be accurate," said Doherty.\n\nThe commissioner hummed thoughtfully. "Well, it's a better lead than nothing," he hedged, "Doherty, take a team down to the docks and check out that son-of-a-bitch. We'll crack her open and see what's inside."\n\nDoherty didn't hesitate for a moment to give his response."

 IRE_investigations.37.t:0 "The Raid on the Warehouse"
 IRE_investigations.37.desc:0 "Inspector Doherty lined up outside of the IRA's warehouse with Flanagan and a number of other Garda officers. His suspicions had been correct, this had been the same warehouse he had seen Neil Blaney and Brigadier General Kelly sneak into. "Everyone get ready," Doherty cautioned, "We have no idea what kind of opposition we'll find in there, so be prepared for anything." With that, the inspector kicked in the door. "This is the Garda! Everyone put your hands up!"\n\nThe inspector's proclamation was met with silence. Doherty and the other Garda officers filed in through the doors, pistols drawn. Over to one side, near a pair of large bay doors, Doherty spotted a car that he had seen outside of his house the night it was attacked. Around him, the Garda officers proceeded through the empty warehouse. "Inspector!" one shouted, lifting a tarp off a large pile, "I think I've got something."\n\nDoherty walked over to the officer. Underneath the tarp was a crate filled with guns. "Jesus," Doherty swore.\n\n"NF LAGs, personal radios, body armor, a ton of ammunition. Inspector, this is military grade equipment, and a lot of it," the officer continued.\n\n"How on earth did the IRA get their hands on all of this?" Doherty asked, "We should have heard about an incident large enough for them to stockpile this much equipment."\n\nFrom across the building, another officer shouted, "Inspector, you'd better come and see this!"\n\nDoherty made his way across the warehouse into a small side room, likely a manager's office. Inside were various documents. Maps of Dublin, of the countryside, attack orders to be relayed. Doherty paled as he realized the implications spelled out by the documents in front of him. They were incomplete, likely whoever wrote them fled before they could be finished, but what lay in front of him could not be denied. He took a deep, shuddering breath.

"To Dublin," he had explained, "I'm going to take my family with me, stay with my daughter and her husband. It'll be nice to get out of Belfast while things calm down." His fellow officers of the Garda were understanding, as having holes blown into your house would make anyone want to get out of town for a bit, and the commissioner had gladly signed off on the request. The inspector hadn't taken significant time off in years. Doherty knew how important his job was. The Republic of Ireland, he thought, would always be more important than any of his personal desires.\n\nDoherty wouldn't be confronting any of those conflicting desires on this "vacation", however. In truth, the department had good reason to be skeptical; while the inspector really would be staying with his daughter in Dublin for a time, it was not an end in and of itself. Instead, it provided a convenient alibi for his true task in the capital: a meeting with the Taoiseach. Pulling up to the side of the road of the government building, the inspector made his way through security, showing the armed security guard a ticket of entry. If anyone asked, the inspector was taking a tour of the building, though in reality he was making his way towards a meeting with Seán Lemass.\n\nInside a little used side office sat the man, alone. He nodded to Doherty as the inspector shut the door behind him. "I'm risking a lot meeting with you like this," the Taoiseach said, "But I trust the commissioner not to jerk me around. I was told you had information for me."\n\nDoherty sat down in an empty chair. "I apologize for the secrecy, but I have reason to believe that the IRA has infiltrated the highest echelons of the government."\n\nLemass narrowed his eyes.

Things that the police already knew, or were not relevant to the case. Their most recent posting, however, was. They were tasked with guarding the warehouse where the IRA weapons were meant to be stored. And that suddenly made all the pieces fall into place for Doherty.\n\nThe officers were guarding the warehouse with the firearms. As part of an army plot, they were letting the IRA come in and take what they needed. However, the government had gotten suspicious over the irregularities that inevitably developed, and they were recalled to Dublin. But they never made it. Thus, the weapons cache, and the plot, had been kept secret until Doherty had stumbled onto it.\n\nBut the attackers were SE, not IRA. What was their part in this?

"They have several members of the SE picked out, and have tracked them down to a safehouse in Limerick. So we could go in there and take them into custody. It will be a quick operation."\n\n"But the problem is that we lack the evidence to go after them, correct?"\n\n"Unfortunately, it was already determined that we lack the evidence to arrest the people in the case. But this was before it took on outsized importance. So I'm asking for special permission to detain them without charge in order to investigate the attack."\n\nLemass sat back in his chair. "Inspector," he said, "you know the ability to deprive Irish citizens of their freedom is something that isn't exercised regularly. It's done in the most exceptional of cases."\n\n"Well, sir, nothing about this is ordinary. That's why I came to you. This case could be the key to unraveling the whole IRA conspiracy against the government. If we get these guys, we can find out just what SE's role in this is, and break into the IRA's organization."\n\nLemass thought it over. "Brigadier Heferson, your thoughts?"\n\n"I trust Doherty," said Heferson. "He's a good inspector, and he hasn't made a mistake so far on this.

 IRE_investigations.45.t:0 "The Bash"
 IRE_investigations.45.desc:0 "Raids on terrorists weren't the usual task of the Garda, but Doherty had been with enough to understand they were treated with a bit more care than the average no-knock raid on a narcotics dealer. Heavy weapons were the norm, and the discovery of the warehouse full of ex-military weapons had given them more cause to take extra precautions. But it all came down to the actual raid on the safehouse, which began as a Garda officer broke the lock with a blast from a shotgun.\n\nThe door flew open, and the rest of the officers began storming inside the building. Two suspects on the bottom floor were taken into custody without incident. On the top of the stairs, however, one saw the police breaking in and began running. A blast from a shotgun loaded with riot rounds did nothing to stop him. As the police stormed onto the second floor, a SE member popped out into the hallway brandishing a pistol. He was hit square in the chest with a rubber bullet, knocking him to the floor as the bullet went up into the ceiling. Before he could get up, the pistol was kicked out of his hand and he was handcuffed.\n\nA few moments later, Doherty got the all clear from the inside and he was allowed to enter. The first signs showed extreme promise. Several weapons were recovered, and Doherty knew at an instant the guns were unusual. Lee-Enfield rifles manufactured in the UK in 1942. Pistols using .38 S&W. Obviously SE had gotten their hands on some British war surplus of their own.\n\nBut that didn't shock Doherty so much as the suspect the police hauled down the stairs. The commotion and shouting between the Garda and their detainee caught the inspector's attention. And what he saw made Doherty's normally stone face fall open agape.\n\nIt was Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, alive and well."

 IRE_investigations.46.desc:0 "Doherty still pieced together in his mind how Ó Brádaigh could have done it. Certainly, he had the car blown up anyway, with a few pieces of personal belongings inside to make it look like he was taken out in the blast. Then, he had that witness set up to tell him the UVF did it. That much was certain, and as long as he lay low, the Garda would have never suspected him of being alive. But that didn't explain what his game was.\n\nThe inspector still found it hard to concentrate, but he tried to go on with searching the house anyway, opening cabinets and drawers to find something of interest. Then, a soldier who had been searching upstairs shoved a book into his hands, with a remark that he would find it interesting. Doherty started looking, and he found that assessment to be accurate.\n\nA record of finances for Saor Éire. Payments, bank account transfers, all was in here. Doherty stopped what he was doing and sat down at the kitchen table to read deeply. This was the key to the entire operation that Ó Brádaigh was doing. Soon, he took out his pocket notebook and started noting items of interest.\n\nThere was one item he found very interesting. The SE, like any decent criminal organization, had taken pains to prevent their finances from being uncovered. Thus, they relied on a complex series of fund transfers between bank accounts to disguise payments and income. Like for instance, this payment would be routed through several accounts, and then made out to. . ."Pol IRA." And this similar payment would go out to. . ."Pol IRA."\n\nWait, why was Ó Brádaigh funding the IRA's political wing?"

"We have all the transactions from Ó Brádaigh's account from them. And a bunch of them keep going into the same accounts. Those accounts, combined with the records at the safehouse, have been identified as belonging to the IRA. So this man was repeatedly sending. . ."\n\n"What the inspector is saying is there is no 'Real IRA,'" Jefferson interrupted. "Ó Brádaigh's been intentionally funding a front this entire time, and it's no stretch to think the SE was behind the whole scheme."\n\nIt took a moment for Flanagan to understand what he had just heard. Upon realization, he immediately turned back to Ó Brádaigh and asked "what the hell?"\n\nÓ Brádaigh gave off a slow chuckle. "I have to be honest, it took you a lot longer to figure the scheme out than I thought it would," he said. "I never thought it would be this successful, though I suppose the Garda is a bit smarter than the army. Willful ignorance I suppose. Blaney so badly wanted an unofficial organization who could fight the Protestants."\n\n"That was his plan all along," Doherty said. "Trick Blaney into providing you guns, organize a coup, then turn on his unwitting accomplices. And it's lucky we figured out what he was up to before he could pull it off."\n\n"You're wrong about one part, inspector," said Ó Brádaigh, "we never intended to march on Dublin at all.""

Doherty sighed, and finally drew out a small flask from his coat pocket, pouring a more than generous splash into his sixth cup of coffee.\n\n"I doubt any of you have forgotten that the Brigadier described an IRA coup in a certain way," Doherty said. "What was the word you used, Brigadier?"\n\n"Imminent, inspector. I said it was imminent."\n\n"Then I'm afraid we leave the room when the government collapses, or when we have a working plan.

It wouldn't be that easy, and he couldn't make such a bold move until his suspect was ready to talk. Doherty knew a dirty conscience when he saw one, and knew that all he needed to do was let the man stew in his own misery. The man sat in his chair, his pale face clutched in his hands, nearly vibrating with pent up anxiety. Doherty uncrossed his arms.

IRE_FT_orange_devil_desc:0 "Troubling news has been passed down from the north of Ireland. Ian Paisley and his violent gang of protestant thugs have seized control of Ulster, thus throwning the stability of the region into disarray. Such a calamitous scenario can not be allowed to persist for a moment longer; we must put all of our effort into restoring our authority over Ireland in its entirety, before Paisley can divide this isle any further.\n\nThe Orange Devil has come out, and it is up to us to prevent the terror many fear he will bring. All hope is not yet lost in Ireland, though its future has undoubtedly become more bleak."
IRE_FT_calm_down_desc:0 "As tensions have begun to mount, and both sides' willingness to resort to conflict increases, we must keep level headsl. An attempt to talk with the Ulster Volunteer Force will be made, and peace must be given a chance. However, Paisley is by no means the ideal man to negotiate with, but some form of compromise will have to be reached if further action is to be prevented.\n\nThis course of action is, unsurprisingly, expected to fail, but at least we will not be the ones who cast the first stone. At least for now."
IRE_FT_or_not_desc:0 "The Ulster Volunteer Force have completely denied our request for them to come to the table, it turns out Paisley is not a man who can be negotiated with. Very few are surprised by this change in events, and even less will be shocked by our response.\n\nThe army of the Republic of Ireland will need to be scrambled in order for us to prepare a decisive military conclusion to this whole mess. "
IRE_FT_integrate_the_garda_desc:0 "As our preparations for the operation against the force that occupies Ulster continues, it has become increasingly obvious to our commanders that we lack the units required to succeed. Nevertheless, the campaign will go ahead. More men will be mobilized.\n\nThese fresh troops will have to come from the Garda; they may not be an ideal fighting force, but little about this whole ordeal could be deemed perfect. As the police and the regular army must stand side by side to fight against the threat of the UVF."
IRE_FT_ask_germany_for_help_desc:0 "The chances of us winning this conflict by ourselves are looking increasingly unsure as time passes by. The outlook for the battles that will inevitably come have been bloody at best, near on massacres at worst. Help will be needed, and those in the government know all too well who they must ask: their masters in Germania.\n\nSo we must ask, beg if need be, for military aid from the Germans; for without it all of Ireland will be far more likely to shatter as a result of this rebellion."
IRE_FT_belfast_blitz_desc:0 "All that can be done to retake the north will be done, no matter the consequence.\n\nIt is with this motto that justifies our actions to bring unity back to the people of Ireland through unconventional means.\n\nWhile the rest of the army prepares ground operations, a small force in Belfast will place explosives around the city. We hope that these bombs will sufficiently disorganize and demoralize the troops of the Ulster Volunteer Force, thus paving the way for us to recapture what is rightfully ours."
IRE_FT_blockade_ulster_desc:0 "We hold very few advantages over our enemy to the north. The sheer extent of the size, armanaments and fanaticism of their force makes them an incredibly dangerous foe. However, there is one trick that we have that no amount of soldiers and weapons can counter; that edge comes in the form of our navy. More specifically, its ability to cut off access into Ulster's main ports.\n\nThe future repercussions of such a maneuver remain unknown, but we are certain that, nevertheless, the time is now right to deploy the navy."
IRE_FT_operation_casemate_desc:0 "All the preparations have been made, the stage is now set. All that remains is for the government to give the military the order to begin the operation; and tear down the terror the Orange Devil represents in doing so. We shall move swiftly and bravely into the NCSZ and restore the order and stability our isle so desperately needs.\n\nYet Ireland's future is as uncertain as ever, God alone knows what fate our Ireland will befall."
IRE_FT_general_staffs_plan_desc:0 "Whatever plan we had originally chosen, it was going to end up as a disaster. Whether it be planning or some other issue that was out of our control, the plan was doomed to fail. After much time and discussion, we have decided to go with the military.\n\nUnlike the civilian methods, this plan depends on the military following orders at the utmost authority inside Ulster. The plan takes notes from the tactics and plans of German tactics that will certainly repress this rebellion. "
IRE_FT_new_emergency_desc:0 "The first part of the General Staff plan is to announce a new Emergency from our government detailing our actions and upcoming motives in the Ulster Crisis. We plan to release this memo as soon as possible to alert the IDF and agents we have ingrained inside the many paramilitary groups that inhabit Ulster.\n\nOnce we announce this, we should begin to move the IDF soldiers that had been ordered to garrison the border to move into Ulster and begin to enforce martial law against the county. While we shall certainly catch fire from some of our more liberal members in the Oireachtas and Army due to personal liberty infringements, we must ignore them and continue. "
IRE_FT_dismantle_the_nic_desc:0 "The Northern Ireland Constabulary has long stood as the government-mandated police force for Ulster and the surrounding county. While they have served well, it has become apparent of late that they are not trustworthy. Rumors have been flying out of the N.I.C. reportedly saying that protestant sympathizers have been working from within to bring down the Constabulary and bring down Ulster with it.\n\nAlong with this, we have seen a rise in communist sympathies in these ranks, with members proudly supporting communist regimes. It has become time to officially dismantle the gentle hand of the N.I.C. and replace it with the much more well-meaning hand of the IDF. "
IRE_FT_purge_the_infiltrators_desc:0 "We have begun to receive more tips that there are even more fifth-columnists that have infiltrated the army. We have begun to systematically eradicate this disease that has infiltrated the army. After we had purged and dismantled the N.I.C., more reports had been flooding in from all over.\n\nWe have also begun to meet to discuss the developments of the aftermath of the N.I.C. and how we have seen a boost of recruitment by many sympathetic Ulsterians. However, the vetting process has revealed time and time again that many of them are attempting to strike us down from the inside. "
IRE_FT_german_methods_desc:0 "As we now have control over Ulster and the zone, we can begin to use our own police force that we have in Ireland. Around forty-seven percent of the officers who signed onto the plan and the mission to bring peace to Ulster had been trained in Germany by Wehrmacht and Ordnungspolizei instructors as apart of a Einheitspakt exercise. After they had come back, the methods they had learned had made the Garda quite the force to be reckoned with. However, it was not adopted by the whole Garda. Now that we are in control, we can begin to train the other fifty-three percent who didn't receive training to be trained. If these methods work as well as they did in Ireland then we will be all set. "
IRE_FT_irish_gestapo_desc:0 "We have begun to receive reports from the Garda units who have been operating within Ulster. For the most part, the Garda's methods have worked quite well. Crime has dropped quite a bit, the margin being certainly larger than it was when the N.I.C. had been the police force for Ulster.\n\nNow that we have seen the true results of these methods, we can begin to take some of the more veteran officers and bring them to military intelligence to train them. It will certainly take some time to train our agents, but the results will certainly be worth it in the end. "
IRE_FT_armageddon_desc:0 "In the new testament, the day of Armageddon is a war of biblical proportions. It can also refer to the "end times".\n\nWhile we may not be starting another World War or the end of days, this will be the culmination of all of our plans coming to fruition. Codenamed Exercise Armageddon, this is one of our largest operations. So far the Garda has done great work in Ulster, with their new training methods and interrogation techniques. Since we have implemented the new tactics, terror attacks have dropped massively. Now that we have prepared enough, we can give Colonel James Kelly full control of the NCSZ. "
IRE_FT_put_blaney_on_trial_desc:0 "Exercise Armageddon worked like a charm, the zone seems to be fully pacified, especially after the Arms Crisis. However, there are still many loose ends. Many of them all coming back to one man, the whole ringleader of this utter disaster. Neil Blaney. Over the past months, we had been preparing to fully remove him from power. A few weeks ago we finally completed this, by arresting him on charges of treason. As we dragged him out of the building, James Kelly arrived to fill the void. This move has certainly angered brass within the IDF, but they need to remember something.\n\nThis is still a democracy..."
IRE_FT_regime_of_the_brigadiers_desc:0 "Now that we have exercised control of Ulster and given Blaney more power, we can use him as our puppet. In the past our government was a bureaucratic mess that had caused more issues than it had solved due to a piss poor leader in Seán Lemass. Kelly has begun to take more power away from the government and directing it towards us. Now that we can exert our control by using McKeown, we can begin to run the country our way. One that is much more continental, one that is much more willing to work with the wider Einheitspakt.\n\nThe people of Ireland may worry, that the end of days is coming and that the Germans are invading. However, they will not fear what comes next if they follow our orders..."
IRE_FT_puppetmaster_desc:0 "The madman has actually done it! Twomey and Saor Éire militants have seized control of the northern zone. We've lost contact with the North Irish Constabulary, and going by their last reports they won't be in any shape to resist Saor Éire. Additionally, Seamus Twomey has made a bold declaration across Irish airwaves from the captured Stormont, declaring the final return of Irish rule to the north, and the end of protestant terror in Ulster. He also proclaimed this was the first step in the end of German domination in Ireland.\n\nThis crisis has parylzed our government; many TDs call for an immediate mobilization of the military to put down these radicals. Several other TDs, however, believe Seamus Twomey can be negotiated with, and we should hear his demands. Whatever course we decide, we have to choose quickly as the situation seems to be rapidly spiraling out of control..."
IRE_FT_revolution_desc:0 "While all eyes are on Ulster and the Saor Éire uprising, we can't afford to overlook the rest of Ireland. There are rumours of Twomey's men causing agitation across the nation, being the cause of riots and mass demonstrations that have broken out in Dublin and many other cities in support of Saor Éire's takeover of Ulster.\n\nAnd still, Twomey defiantly broadcasts from Stormont, and now he's turned his attention against the government itself. He demands our government acquiesce to his demands, or Saor Éire will "turn the righteous fury of the Irish towards those who stand in their way". The situation is dire, and we have no good options. Suppressing the revolt by force would certainly embolden Saor Éire, and could even lead to civil war. Negotiation would make us look weak and force us to submit to some unagreeable demands, but might be the only peaceful resolution to this conflict."
IRE_FT_negotiations_desc:0 "After much deliberation in the government, we have chosen to agree to negotiations with Twomey and the Saor Éire. This was the only real choice, after all. If we put down Twomey and Saor Éire, they would become martyrs for their cause, and many would take arms to avenge him. Additionally, many in the military sympathise with Saor Éire already, and at best they would refuse to carry out our orders, and at worst, would join Twomey.\n\nUnfortunately, negotiation is our only option. Preparations are already being made for negotiations between our government and Saor Éire. We'll hear out their demands, unreasonable or not, and work towards an outcome that doesn't bring us civil war."
IRE_FT_expel_german_advisors_desc:0 "One of Twomey's hard demands is that we immediately sever ties with the Unity Pakt. While some TDs and advisors are saying this demand is unreasonable, and Ireland would suffer some economic fallout from this move, if we don't give in to Twomey, he'll walk out and Saor Éire will revolt across Ireland.\n\nThe first step in severing ties will be expelling all German economic and military advisors. Polite letters will be sent to German officers embedded in our military, thanking them for their help, but insisting their service is no longer needed. German business advisors will receive the same treatment. Though Twomey's fiery rhetoric demands the Germans be sent packing with their tails behind their legs, there's no need to be rude about it."
IRE_FT_withdraw_from_the_pakt_desc:0 "It's finally time to pull the plug. Withdrawing from the Pakt has been a long time coming, but we hoped it'd be on our own terms, not forced by terrorist threats. Many Pakt officials are going to have a very unpleasant morning. Twomey's demands stated all Einheitspakt ties must be severed immediately, with no concessions or reparations to them. Though our government will be more gracious in giving them some notice and a small timeframe to get out, these departures will wreck our nation.\n\nOur military will be reeling from the loss of Pakt expertise and training, but hopefully our officers will be able to retain some of their lessons and keep their knowledge alive. The loss of German companies will cause our economy to crash, hard. Hopefully we'll someday be able to recover, but the loss of Pakt economic and military assistance will see us hurting for years..."
IRE_FT_preparations_desc:0 "Despite us opening negotiations with Seamus Twomey and Saor Éire, we still must make preparations for the worst. The possibility that Twomey's agreement to negotiate is merely a ploy, and he'll walk out on us once we reject his more outrageous demands. If this happens, he could turn around to the Irish people and proclaim that we're weak, unwilling to fight for a united Ireland, and start an uprising. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n\nDespite us being ready to put our best foot forward in the negotiations, we have to prepare for the unthinkable. Plans for securing vital infrastructure, bases, and government buildings to ensure any revolt is snuffed out. The army will be put on high alert, ready for anything."
IRE_FT_call_up_the_reserves_desc:0 "In the event of the unthinkable, we'd be dreadfully short on manpower. Many young Irish men have found themselves swept up by Twomey's fiery speeches and promises, and would flock to Saor Éire in the event of an uprising. Even within our own military, many enlisted and even some officers could be swayed to Twomey's side.\n\nHowever, we still have one reliable source of soldiers: old veterans of wars past. Many in the older generation are frightened and disgusted by the rhetoric spouted by Saor Éire, and would be willing to lay down their lives for the Ireland they fought to preserve years ago. Increasing the maximum age for the military would bring us more men, though men past their prime but making up for it in dedication."
IRE_FT_law_and_order_desc:0 "Though we've appeared weak for negotiating with Twomey and letting Saor Éire remain in control of Limerick and Cork, it's finally time to remind them who's really in charge. With our military manpower replenished by old veterans, and Twomey calmed down, we can finally reassert control in Ireland. Our military will move in to reoccupy territories and disarm Saor Éire militants, hopefully without too much conflict. If they want a peaceful resolution to this conflict as much as we do, they'll stand down once they see our military roll in. Hopefully, after working with us and seeing us capitulate to one of his demands, Twomey will let us re-establish control over those territories."
IRE_FT_enough_is_enough_desc:0 "With the Pakt gone, and our economy and military reeling, Twomey has got what he wanted.\n\nThere will be no more concessions.\n\nThere will be no more negotiations.\n\nTwomey has gotten enough. We've avoided crushing Saor Éire with our military might. To the Irish people and those around the world, we've shown our good side, that we're willing to work with even those who would tear down the country to get what they want. Now, it's in Twomey's hands. He can go quietly, satisfied with what concessions he's gotten. Or, he can reject our good graces and find out what happens."
IRE_The_Minefield_desc:0 "We have decided that the best way to deal with the arms crisis is through a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Unfortunately, it isn't as simple or as easy as just declaring that we want peace and calling it a day. The arms crisis didn't come out of nowhere; there are major tensions thrumming throughout Northern Ireland that have persisted for decades, these won't simply disappear in the name of peace.\n\nIan Paisley desires tolerance for the Protestants of the north and independence for Ulster. Seamus Twomey desires armed revolution and personal power. Neither of their desires sit well with the Dáil, or with each other and their respective followers. In a time where hatred and revenge are the driving forces of the day, negotiating a path to peace between the two iron wills of these conflicting desires will require navigating a veritable minefield..."
IRE_Stormont_Emergency_Meeting_desc:0 "The Northern Ireland Assembly, known informally as the Stormont has not been an especially powerful voice in the politics of our Northern province recently, at least in part due to the fact that our government has spent much of its downtime making sport of arbitrarily restricting its actions and powers. Despite this, we should note that it is still technically the legal representation for the region. This gives it a certain sense of authority, authority we could use to end this whole farce.\n\nWere we to call an emergency session and put forth some resolutions there would technically be little the more ardent anti-ulsterite voices could do. Getting from there to actually starting a peace process though will be quite the challenge indeed."
IRE_Appease_The_Moderates_desc:0 "O'Neil's Unionists, at least some of them, and Fitt's nationalists, again at least some of them, are a small bastion of sanity in the chaotic mess of Northern Irish political life. This leads to them being considered the "default" voices of reason by much of the Northern populace on both sides of the fence. Thankfully, we think we can get them both to cooperate with the peace process.\n\nIt will take some work, promises of respecting the legal boundaries of certain institutions, some more freedoms for the Anglican elements and continued patronage to the Catholics and so and so forth. The important point is that if we have them on side, we don't need those who are less conducive to peace efforts any more. Which means we can address them more thoroughly."
IRE_Control_The_NIC_desc:0 "The Northern Ireland Constabulary is an organisation of dubious loyalty at the best of times, and right now the times are most assuredly not that. We are uncertain as to the exact degree it has been infiltrated by a variety of groups, and identifying the who, why and where of this infiltration will be key to keeping the organisation under our thumb.\n\nWe do have loyal men there after all, it is merely a matter of separating them from the disloyal and incompetant. We might also be capable of working with elements who have similarly vested interests in peace, the Ulster Scots for example. This is key to our goals because if the Constabulary cannot be convinced of peace, how the hell are we going to put it in force between the paramilitaries?"
IRE_Arrest_Troublemakers_desc:0 "The Northern Irish Constabulary has been brought to heel, which means we can proceed with the next step of our plan. Ian Paisley is a menace and likely a traitor to boot but he's also one of the most prominent voices for the non-Catholic population in Northern Ireland. Twomey is equally as problematic, allegations of outright marxism aside the man will never accept a peace offered by the Unionists to begin with.\n\nSo we shall arrest them both, NOT kill them, merely arrest them. After all it never hurts to be paranoid, and frankly without those two running about we can address some of the less simple problems with more freedom."
IRE_Prevent_Leaks_desc:0 "Blaney's connection to the Irish Republican Army is something incredible, it really is a testament to the mans skills that he pulled off all he did. Unfortunately, if this ever became public knowledge then any chance of peace would be thrown out of the proverbial window, into the proverbial street and then into the proverbial sewer.\n\nThis MUST stay secret, by any means at our disposal. We shall set some loyal men to the task, men who value peace over glory and whose loyalty is unquestioned. There will be no commendations, no records, no notes. They will do their duty for the good of Ireland, they will do their duty to the people and with any luck nobody will ever know."
IRE_Burn_Evidence_desc:0 "Certain actions taken by certain people nominally under the auspices of our own government were regrettable, they were mistakes and they threaten the attempt at peace in Northern Ireland. If they were to be released to the general public chaos could ensure, and so it falls upon us to take the hard choice and remove the evidence which could implicate members of our government in such actions.\n\nThere will be a reckoning for this one day, but hopefully by the time anyone realises something is amiss Ireland will have long ago turned its swords into plowshares."
IRE_Negotiating_is_Non_Negotiable_desc:0 "Paisley and Twomey want concessions for their agreement to a peaceable solution in Northern Ireland. We've decided since their suggested concessions are mutually exclusive to just stick them in the same room and see what comes of it. Hopefully the tortured mess of a compromise they produce will result in something halfway there to an actual solution. Even if nothing of value comes of this however we'll still get the entertainment value of watching two of Ireland's most notorious figures shouting at each other for hours on end. Perhaps we should consider recording it for posterity?"
IRE_German_Question_desc:0 "Apparently God is real because miracles like this just don't occur naturally. It seems that Paisley and Twomey got along swimmingly in their mutual confinement. So much so that they have come to an agreement that despite their mutual differences and utter hatred for each others' causes - they agree that the real problem is Germany. Because of course it is.\n\nTheir suggested red line for a peace agreement and the standing down of all paramilitary forces is Ireland's withdrawal from the Pakt, immediately. This might be a risky move, but we really don't have any other options here. And we can blame the communists if things do go horribly wrong after all."

IRE_crisis.1.t:0 "Sitting Down With The Devil"
IRE_crisis.1.desc:0 "The negotiators had just flown in from Belfast, and were hurried into a vehicle to head straight to Áras an Uachtaráin. They were evidently tired from the long period of negotiation and the flight. They were afforded a small break for tea before Seán Lemass walked in. By their lack of reaction, Lemass knew what news they had wasn't good.\n\n"So, what does Paisley want?" he asked.\n\n"What doesn't he want?" responded the chief negotiator. "Complete independence for Ulster. He wants out of the country. We tried to convince him to lessen his demands, but he refused. He wants nothing to do with Ireland, and he thinks he has all the cards."\n\n"Oh." Lemass started thinking about what this meant. To surrender so much of the island to the protestant lunatics was unacceptable. To put so many Irish citizens in harms way was unacceptable. And so would giving up what his nation had fought so hard to keep. But, just to make sure. . .\n\n"And, by Ulster, does he mean. . ."\n\n"Yes," said the head negotiator. "All of it. And he would get Derry too, if he could."\n\nThat did it then. Only one way forward for Ireland and Fianna Fáil."
IRE_crisis.1.a:0 "We go to war."

IRE_crisis.2.t:0 "The Irish Defence Forces"
IRE_crisis.2.desc:0 "But we do have the men for the task," asked Lemass, "don't we?"\n\n"Yes we do, sir," said Field Marshal Carl O'Sullivan. "Far more than we need for the task. However, all of them only have guns that were only good for the last war. None of our equipment is new or modern, only hardly adequate. And in many cases, we don't even have the equipment at all. We prioritized a massive army over one we could actually outfit, and this is the problem. Hell, our only plan for anything was just to hold on and have the Heer take care of it."\n\n"I see," Lemass said. "Admiral McKenna," he asked, "could you be able to provide the army with support?"\n\nAdmiral Thomas McKenna shook his head. "The whole fleet's in need of repair," he said. "We put off maintenance of our vessels for too long, and the only ship we can really put out to sea right now is a cruiser from World War Two. Our destroyers are breaking down, and I have to think twice before sending out our faulty submarines. We can block things from getting into Belfast, but not much else if we don't call the Kriegsmarine."\n\nNow that was giving Lemass something to worry about. "But surely the Air Force can help? It's in a better position, correct?"\n\n"In my understanding, yes" said General Pat Quinlan. "The aircraft are far more modern from what I've seen, and they are maintained well enough to be effective. But, no fuel, so we can't rely on them to replace the Luftwaffe."\n\nLemass felt a lump in his throat. There were no two ways about it. The only chance he could get this war done before the election was to follow the plan and get the help of the one nation that could do anything in this situation."

IRE_crisis.3.t:0 "Operational Garda Units"
IRE_crisis.3.desc:0 "Sergeant Patrick Walsh marched down O'Connell Street in Dublin in a uniform much too uncomfortable for the occasion. Walsh, much like the others marching in lockstep alongside him, had all been conscripted from the Garda in an effort to raise troops against Paisley's Protestants in the north. The Taoiseach, in all of his wisdom, had decided to show off his shiny new recruits in a grand parade through the streets of Dublin, all dressed up to the nines. The newly minted Sergeant assumed it was an attempt to show Ireland that things were all under control, though he had to wonder if the Taoiseach was simply trying to convince himself.\n\nIt seemed as if the whole of the city had turned out for the event. Civilians were crammed on either side of the street, shouting uproariously and waving the green, white, and orange of the tricolor. The air had an almost imploring tone, almost begging the procession to bring the world back to some kind of normal.\n\nWalsh tried not to fidget with the unfamiliar weight of the rifle held in his arms; he knew how to shoot, every Garda did, but he was more comfortable with a pistol than an assault rifle. The Taoiseach may have looked at the Garda and seen disciplined men ready to be molded into soldiers, but Walsh had not joined the Garda to go off to war. No, he had joined out of a love for his country and a desire to help people, though in a roundabout way, he mused, that was still what he was doing. He knew that what they were doing was going to help Ireland in the long run; like pulling out a rotten tooth, it would be painful but necessary to restore the nation's health.\n\nThe band ahead of the procession began to strike up a song as they crossed the bridge over the river Liffey, the tune sounding melancholy to the Sergeant's ears."

IRE_crisis.4.desc:0 "Hauptmann Luis Geiger was the most nervous he had ever been outside of the combat zone. Service during the West Russian War was one thing. Fighting his own countrymen was another. But briefing the Führer? That was the most harrowing experience of all.\n\n"The Ulster Volunteer Force under Ian Paisley has taken over the north of the country," he explained, trying his best to stay composed. "Their demands are complete independence for the North of Ireland so they can establish their own Protestant state. Seán Lemass has the Irish army on high alert to deal with them, but it's not enough. He is asking for German support to drive them out in the next two months."\n\n"Two months, Hauptmann?" asked [GER.GetLeader]. Geiger nodded. "Why is it such a rush?"\n\n"Mein Führer," Geiger said, "Ireland still retains a degree of political autonomy, and Fianna Fáil, the ruling party, is still technically constrained by democracy. And the consequences of an unsuccessful war are dire. In two months, they have elections, and the opposition Fine Gael will remove Ireland from the Pakt if they come to power. If Ulster is not pacified by then, the government will lose at the polls."\n\n[GER.GetLeader] was clearly troubled by this, as this was essentially a warning. Either Germany would save Ireland, or Ireland would realign itself out of the Pakt. There was only one option for the Reich to take.\n\n"Very well, Hauptmann," said [GER.GetLeader]. "We will mobilize a Panzergrenadier Operational Group to be deployed there immediately. Tell the Luftwaffe to begin an air bridge to Dublin for immediate deployment. Dismissed.""

IRE_crisis.5.desc:0 "Several hours after leaving Cologne, a Luftwaffe Junkers JU 152 received clearance to land from Dublin. Landing on the runway, the passenger aircraft taxied its way to a special section of the tarmac. Once there, a set of stairs was rolled up to it. The hatch open, and out in single file came the passengers; German soldiers, in single file, carrying their bags of equipment.\n\nMore planes came from the Reich. One after the other, they landed, unloaded their passengers or cargo, and then left. Many were in Luftwaffe markings, but several flew under Lufthansa banners. Some opened at the front of the aircraft, some at the back. They carried men, weapons, vehicles, tanks, everything a Panzer group would need for fighting. No sooner after the men had landed, they were placed onto busses and trucks to be taken to a place nearer to the front. The equipment and weaponry stayed a bit longer, to be organized and loaded onto recently arrived Unimog trucks.\n\nThis was Germany's response to Ireland's crisis. An entire Panzer brigade, flown straight from the continent to the island. For the first time since Crete, an entire German force would be delivered and supplied via air. It was one of the most stunning shows in military history. And a demonstration of the power of the Reich.\n\nWatching this with some Irish officers and the German attache for propaganda purposes, Lemass couldn't help but be impressed. No matter how much he hated it, the Germans were a more efficient and advanced war machine than Ireland. And, fortunately for him, this might be enough to handle the Northern Irish situation once and for all."

He knew all of them by name and definitely knew why that had come to him. All looked identical in Irish military uniform, looking very German thought Lemass.\n\n"What brings you gentlemen to my office?" He looked around the room before answering his own question. "I assume it has to do with the current situation in Ireland?" he asked the men without looking up from his papers. The past few months have been nothing more than a shitshow for the government. Between the riots and bombings, Ulster was primed to explode at any point.\n\n"Well, you guessed right Lemass," said recently promoted, Brigadier General Kelly. He had a bit of a smile at the corner of his mouth. "After talks between myself, Mckeown, and the rest of the General Staff, we have decided on a new plan that will end this crisis once and for all." He gives a folder of papers to Lemass, who opens them and reads them before recoiling.\n\n"What in the bloody hell is this?" said Lemass, clearly angered at what he was reading. "Operation Armageddon? Executive Powers? Mass Represials? Do you have any fucking idea how fragile this whole situation is Kelly?". Lemass wanted an answer as his blood began to boil. Who the hell did these muppets think they are, walking into his office and giving him the most bollocks plan?\n\n"Well these would only occur if we would really need to use them, for the most part, we are just acting as a sweeping force to replace the NIC and talk over" Finished Kelly, Lemass looked up at him nodding.

He had been up for nearly nineteen hours at this point, waiting and waiting to get the call that his bomber group was taking off for a mission above Ulster. It had felt like a decade while taxiing on the runway, he had never seen real combat before, neither had the rest of his squadron. The briefing had been quite short if he was being truthful to himself, only a few minutes before the colonel had dismissed them.\n\nHe was awoken when his pilot's voice cracked through the headphones. They are right above the target, Seamus looked through his bombsights before plotting some points. He pulled the lever and heard the bay opening and out fell the bombs, all high ordinance. He sighed and waited to hear the result from the bombers behind them. The radio then cackled from the operator above him. Seamus made out that the bombs had hit their mark.\n\nAs the bomber circled around on its way back to the airfield, Seamus looked down. He expected to see a bridge, with a convoy fallen into the water. Instead, he saw a collapsed bridge with civilian cars dotting the now blocked waterway. It seemed he could barely make out an ambulance in the wreckage as cars had arrived at the scene with equipment to attempt to rescue the survivors. His eyes widened at the carnage that he had occurred, if he had said that the lever jammed then the destruction wouldn't' have occurred, all of the civilians dead. He looked in despair at his hands."

IRE_crisis.10.desc:0 "Captain Patrick McCullogh and his platoon marched out alongside their IFVs as they made their way through the streets of Belfast. Their orders were to move into the volatile Special Zone and enforce Martial Law on the populace, an order that he wasn't incredibly happy to be complying with in the first place. He had no real sympathy for the protestant and communist agitators that were the cause of all this madness in the first place, yet he felt for the innocent people of Ulster that had been swept up in everything from day one. They didn't deserve this, he thought.\n\nRounding a corner, the platoon came across a large mob of people rioting in the streets. The Captain could see what remained of the peaceful protest that the riot had grown from; cardboard signs demanding accountability from Dublin and the immediate removal of the NIC from Ulster. "This is the Ireland Defense Forces," the Captain said into a megaphone, "The NCSZ is now under Martial Law. Disperse now and return to your homes, or you will be arrested."\n\nThe declaration didn't have the calming effect that the Captain had hoped for. Several of the rioters picked up empty bottles and debris off the ground and began to throw them at the assembled soldiers. "Get out of Ulster you fascist pigs!" one particularly brave rioter shouted.\n\nMcCullogh shook his head, it seemed force would be necessary once again. Giving an order, a water cannon fired from the tops of the IFVs into the crowd. The crowd fled in a fit of terror, trampling those unable to move fast enough, and soldiers moved in to arrest the stragglers "This is Alpha team, we've sent the rioters up back towards town hall," he reported into his radio, "You should be able to cut them off there."\n\n"Good copy," the radio spat out in a hiss of static, "Keep up the good work alpha.

The building had been under a light siege for the past few days, a siege that had been easily dispatched when an armored column rolled up to the building. O'Donnell couldn't help but feel the slightest twinges of guilt as he made his way to the commissioner's office, though it was overshadowed by the iron determination to follow out his orders to the letter.\n\nThe commissioner barely looked up from the papers strewn across his desk at the Major's entry. "Ah, good," he said, shuffling papers around, "You must be the relief I asked for. Took you fellows long enough."\n\n"Actually, that's not what we're here for," O'Donnell interrupted, handing the commissioner a letter. "I have orders for you here."\n\nUnsealing the envelope, the commissioner's face turned several shades of red as he skimmed the contents of the letter. "The NIC dismantled, all files seized," he sputtered, "What is the meaning of this? Why wasn't I informed of this sooner?"\n\n"Simply put," the Major responded, "The military no longer trusts the Constabulary to serve the best interests of the Republic at this time. Had you been given advanced notice, you may have destroyed or hidden crucial information that you don't want the military to see." The Major glared at the commissioner, the man flinching from his gaze. "The NIC is a loose end, and the IDF wants it tied."\n\nThe commissioner steeled himself for one final retort, before deflating in defeat. "What do you require from me, Major?" he asked feebly.\n\n"Only your complete cooperation," the Major replied."

He had been selected by his captain to attend a seminar on "extracting information" from a suspect, a discipline that Flynn was quickly coming to learn was little more than a fancy way of saying "torture."\n\n"Denailing," said the instructor in a much too excited tone, "Is a particularly effective form of torture that has been used for centuries." The instructor, a fellow named Hans Freidrich, spoke with a strong German accent, and was rumored to have once been a part of the Orpo back in Germania. Given the man's sadistic nature, Flynn was inclined to believe those rumors, though he doubted that the man ever left. "And it is easy too," the man continued, producing a penknife from his back pocket, "All you have to do is simply slide the knife underneath the nail, and then pop!" There was a collective indrawn breath as the instructor mimed the fingernail coming off in one smooth motion. Flynn felt a bit sick himself, a sentiment that many in the room seemed to be sharing.\n\nA few of the officers in the conference were not sharing the same sentiment, instead enraptured in the display of cruelty being presented to them. One of the officers in that group raised his hand to ask a question. "Why just the fingernail, and not the entire finger? Surely getting rid of the finger hurts more," he asked.\n\n"A good question," replied the instructor cheerfully, "The area around the top of the finger and the nail itself are extremely sensitive. Have you ever had a papercut? It is painful in the same way, though I am told it is much worse. Also, you get more chances with just the nail! Nails grow back, fingers and toes do not."\n\nAn officer towards the back got up and all but ran out, his face green. Flynn held his head in his hands. It would be a long seminar"

Lieutenant James O'Malley led a small team, just four other officers of the Irish Military Intelligence, down the hall, searching for the apartment in question. They had received an anonymous tip from a neighbor that the occupants of Apartment 46, the Fleming family, were secretly UVF sympathisers, and were supposedly plotting some kind of attack. Whether or not the allegations were true was irrelevant, it was a potential threat, and it would be dealt with accordingly.\n\nComing up to the correct apartment, O'Malley kicked in the door, the tremendous crash causing the family at the table to jerk up from their Grace in alarm, fear writ clearly across their faces. "James Fleming?" O'Malley intoned, "Military intelligence, you'll be coming with us."\n\nFleming stood up in indignant rage, "Who put you up to this?" he all but shouted, "Was it that fucking asshole O'Donovan?"

Two other officers picked him up off the floor, putting him in handcuffs. "Who reported you is irrelevant. I suggest that you come quietly, if not for your sake than that of your family." O'Malley said. His eyes flicked over the woman and child, still huddling at the table, the woman visibly pregnant. "Take them, too," he ordered.\n\n"No!" Fleming shouted, straining desperately against his bonds, "Leave them alone! They've got nothing to do with anything! You can't do this!"\n\nO'Malley leaned in, his face impassive. "Oh," he said."

"Citizens of Ulster," he declared to the flashing of cameras and the clicking of shutters, "As today, the Stormont Parliament of the Northern Counties Special Zone is officially disbanded." Murmurs of shock and dismay filtered through the crowd at the announcement, and the Brigadier General had to raise his voice to be heard. "Going forward, the county of Ulster will now operate under martial law for an indefinite period of time," he said, a hush falling over the crowd, "As we speak, IDF soldiers are carrying out a number of raids across the NCSZ on the paramilitaries that are infesting our homes.

Comrade Finnigan nervously held his rifle, nervously waiting for the army to come around the corner and start opening fire.\n\n"Take heart, comrades!" Commissar Curran shouted over a bullhorn. "For although we may die on this day, our blood spilled in the name of the proletarian revolution shall inspire workers across the island a hundredfold! Was it not Connolly's death that inspired thousands of others to fight for a socialist republic? Hold the line, comrades, and the reactionaries will be in awe at our determination!"\n\nThe mortar fire started up, and the peripheries of the defenses were obliterated in showers of smoke and debris. Then came the snipers, picking off anyone whose head was visible above the makeshift barricades. At last, the army men themselves started rolling in, automatic rifles blazing.\n\nComrade Finnigan suddenly came to realize that he didn't want to die stupidly, cowering behind an overturned truck. Sure, he wanted a proletarian revolution, but he wanted to be alive to see the end of it! He dropped his rifle and ran toward a nearby alleyway, ignoring the furious shoutings of Commissar Curran about deserting the workers and betraying the cause. A few moments later, the spot where he was hunkered down was obliterated in a mortar strike.\n\nComrade Finnigan, or just Finnigan now, kept running, not daring to look back, while the Limerick Soviet died as briefly and violently as it was born."

RTE showed soldiers marching through the streets of Derry, to the applause and raucous cheers of its Catholic neighborhoods' residents. Similar scenes were playing out in Belfast, though with far more muted Catholic celebration and plenty of disdainful stares from Protestants.\n\nThe sight was almost enough to bring a tear to his eye. The goal of decades of fighting, killing, and dying by thousands of Irishmen was finally complete: a united, free, thirty-two county Republic. The souls of Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet, Patrick Pearce, and countless other martyrs could at last rest peacefully in the soil of their independent homeland.\n\nOne of his aides walked into the room, carrying a telegram. On it are simply the words "Our end of the bargain is done." It was unsigned and the sender's address was some random apartment in Dublin, but Twomey knew what it meant. All investigations into him were dropped and all charges against him were lifted. Although it seemed a bit ridiculous, he couldn't help but burst into joyous laughter at it. He then strode out of the safehouse and stepped into the sunlight, laughing all the while."

A few of them were glaring at him with nothing but spite. Some seats were even empty, with their would-be occupants refusing to be in the same building as him. Such was life in Stormont.\n\nAbsences notwithstanding, the speech had to go on. He arranged his notes and began speaking, his voice low:\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen of the North Irish Parliament, I didn't come here to speak to you about grand, sweeping agreements, or decisive laws that can solve all our problems with in one fell swoop. It is folly to think that over eight hundred years of history can be forgotten with the stroke of a pen, or to think that history can be forgotten at all. Rather, I am here to talk about careful steps and cautious changes. Some may deride these moves as slow, ineffective, or paralyzed, but they are the only way tultimately accomplish change while leaving everyone satisfied. And I believe it is the only way to bring about change on this island so that anyone, northern or southern, Catholic or Protestant, nationalist or unionist, can hope to accomplish anything."\n\nHe continued to talk at length, expounding on the virtues of cooperation and finding common ground, before ending with a quote from the Bible: "He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."\n\nThe speech was met with muted applause from most of the MPs and disdainful silence from the remainder.

Lemass be damned, if Twomey was to be executed today then he'd not spent his final moments in fear. The door slammed open and government lapdogs poured into his home, shouting demands - yelling for him to cooperate. Seamus didn't open his eyes, merely enjoying the cool breeze of Irish air as it wafted in with the thugs. He was ready.

These flimsy pieces of paper - these simple documents were the key to Irish unity at long last.\n\nLemass stormed through parliament on a warpath, snatching up legislators wherever he could find them, and having new MP's called in where he could not. By the evening the first draft of the agreement had been hashed out from what was said in the transcripts, and care was taken to compromise with Twomey and Lemass - just as surely as they had compromised with each other.\n\nThe rough proposal would be sent to Long Kesh soon enough, despite the protests of some party-men saying that the provisions of nullifying ALL Ties to German investors, returning all advisors and revoking all official relations to the Reich was too likely to end in economic or military disaster.

It was that knowledge that Lemass had leaned on when he ordered for there to be no abnormal military presence within views of the cameras. There would be no violence - everyone wanted this agreement to some degree.\n\n"With my signature, I trust that we are building a sovereign Ireland today, free of repugnant foreign influence," explained Seamus Twomey to the cameras, as he scrawled his signature on the document.\n\n"And with the consent of the communities I represent," began Paisley, stepping into Twomey's place at the document after he was finished, "we sign this document to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the protestant communities and acknowledge that we are no more or less Irish than any man in Dublin."\n\n"I have little to say," said Lemass when it was his turn.

The deaths of Twomey and his leaders in Saor Éire had unearthed a scandal that had the Irish government on its knees: Saor Éire and the Real IRA were one and the same. Chaos had gripped the towns and cities of Ulster following the revelation; leaders of the Irish garrison had been arrested and the rank and file of the garrison itself had been purged for fears of collusion. The chaos had culminated in mass defection of the N.I.C. to the UVF, and they had brought with them crucial information: the locations of several of Saor Éire's weapons caches. In one fell swoop, all of Paisley's enemies had been brought low, and his allies were stronger than ever before.\n\nNever would there be a better time to strike.\n\nSounds of automatic gunfire filled the streets of Belfast as Paisley and his soldiers marched towards the garrison's headquarters. The attack had started early in the morning, with a coordinated series of attacks on the interim leadership of the garrison. Hearing that the command structure of the garrison had once again been crippled, Paisley sounded the attack. The fighting had lasted the better part of the day; even crippled, the garrison was a formidable foe. Nonetheless, the garrison forces had continued to fall back with every attack on their positions; it seemed that the tide of the Volunteer Force could not be held back.\n\nPaisley and his forces reached the headquarters, coming to a halt. He was handed a megaphone.. "This is Ian Paisley and the Ulster Volunteer Force," he projected, "We have you cornered. There can be no further retreat. The Stormont has already been taken, surrender now and you will be spared."\n\nIt took mere minutes for a man carrying a white flag to emerge from the garrison. Paisley smiled.

Lemass held his head in his hands. The Brigadier General had demanded a meeting with the Taoiseach earlier in the morning, and had promised him answers to "all of his problems," he had said. The Taoiseach was of the mind to deny the meeting with the Brigadier General outright, but at this point he couldn't afford to. Lemass was out of options.\n\n"And am I to forget that the mess in question is all of your's, Blaney's and Haughey's doings?" the Taoiseach asked, voice dry.\n\n"If you would allow me to continue, sir," Kelley clipped back, "I believe that I have a solution to get everything back under control." The man turned back to his pegboard. "Ian Paisley and Seamus Twomey. Two of the people responsible for Ulster being on fire right now. The plan is simple." Kelley slapped the board with the pointer, causing Lemass to jolt in his seat. "A decapitation strike, we simultaneously arrest and execute key members of both the UVF and the SE, dismantling their leadership and sending their terrorists scurrying back to their homes. In the confusion, the military moves back in and enforces martial law. All dissent will be put down until the situation returns to normal. It would take time to organize, we have to be careful to cut every head off of this particular hydra, but it will work."\n\nLemass sighed, massaging his temples.

It would be a tense situation, but it would be just the thing to get the moderate unionists to the table. Such a standoff could not be won by either side, so that would nip any terrorist movement in the bud. And then, they might be brought to the negotiating table.\n\nThis was perhaps the most complicated and time-intensive plan. So many things could go wrong with it. There would be protests, certainly. There would be violence on the streets of Belfast. And not everyone who was responsible for this disaster would get justice.

All diplomatic, military and economic ties to the Reich were demanded to be cut off overnight, else there could be no peace. That was about ten steps too far.

The terrorist Seamus Twomey of the communist-leaning paramilitary organization Saor Éire outmaneuvered the Irish army, which had been tutored by our own wehrmacht for decades, to forcefully occupy the northern counties that had previously been a slice of the United Kingdom. Twomey's demand had been a complete annulment of all ties to our Reich - else there would be civil war for the fate of the nation.\n\nIt seems the spineless Fianna Fáil party were unwilling to fight for their place in the world, and have now caved in to the treacherous Bolsheviks demands."

Normally, there would be a spread of topics that Abs could browse through, getting a general sense of how the world was doing on any given day. Today, though, all the newspapers were dominated by one common headline.\n\n"Ireland out of the Einheitspakt," he muttered.\n\nDepicted on the front pages was a picture that the man was certain would become iconic in the small island nation. Sean Lemass, their leader, was sat between two other men that Abs didn't quite recognize, though the caption named them as Ian Paisley and Seamus Twomey. The three men were adding their signatures to a document in front of them, putting an official end to the paramilitary violence that had been plaguing the north for quite some time now. It was undoubtedly a good thing for the troubled country, though the terms of what had been dubbed the Good Friday Agreement dictated that Ireland would have to make an immediate and inelegant exit from the German sphere.\n\nThe Beobachter, the rag that it was, decried the agreement as the work of a Judeo-Bolshevik plot to destabilize the Pakt, and Germany as a whole, and while he questioned the attention a Zionist cabal might give to such an unimportant nation as Ireland, he had no doubts about what Ireland leaving so suddenly would do to the stability of the Einheitspakt as a whole, or more importantly, to his finances. The industrial giants, IG Farben included, had been given carte blanche to run roughshod through the Irish economy. An exit from the Pakt like the one Ireland had just agreed to was sure to cost him millions.\n\nSnarling, Abs snubbed out his cigar into a nearby ashtray, calling out for his secretary."

In one fell swoop, he had not only put an end to the unending violence and unrest in the north, but had also managed to get his nation out of the despised Einheitspakt, while all the while being able to act as if he had no choice in the matter whatsoever.\n\nThe de-Germanization process had already begun. Across Ireland, German military advisors were being escorted to awaiting ships, where they would be returned home to the Reich in shame. Similarly, German owned businesses were being boarded up, their former owners being similarly escorted to similarly awaiting boats. Some of the Taoiseach's financial advisers were already noticing a worryingly sharp downtick in the Irish economy, but Lemass dismissed the concerns as mere growing pains. Ireland would have to get a little bit worse before it got better.\n\nFor now, Lemass was sitting at a small table in front of a crowd of reporters, flanked by Paisley and Twomey on either side. In front of them were copies of the documents that had been drawn up, dubbed the Good Friday Agreement. Around him, cameras flashed, immortalizing the moment that Ireland would finally achieve peace.\n\nPicking up his pen, Lemass spoke, "This is a historic day for all Irish citizens. Today marks an end to the conflicts that have threatened to drive us apart, brother against brother, father against child. Today, Ireland is forged whole, and becomes the master of her own destiny."\n\nAnd with a stroke of his pen, cameras flashing around him, the Taoiseach brought peace once more to his troubled nation, and delivered Ireland out into the world, free as it has always wanted to be."

It had come from a Mr. Ian Paisley, a man that had been in the news recently for violently revolting against the Republic of Ireland, and it had offered him nearly unconditional overlordship over the newly independent Ulster.\n\nIt was an offer that, quite frankly, he wanted to decline.\n\nWilson knew more than anyone that the England that Mr. Paisley was so nostalgic for was long dead and buried. There was no more monarch, no more grand empire, just a small, troubled nation, trying to find its identity after decades of oppression. In that respect, he chuckled, he supposed that he could sympathise with Mr. Paisley. No, what he was afraid of was that Belfast's ideas of what England should be would differ greatly from London's. The Ulsterites had risen once in a difference of opinion, who was to say that they wouldn't do so again?\n\nAnd yet, he mused, there was always an "and yet." There were always reasons to accept the offer lingering in the back corners of his mind, tempting him with their whispers of prestige and grandeur. Reintegration of the territory would do wonders for the popularity of the SLP, especially his faction in it. They'd be able to secure an even greater majority in the next election. And didn't the Ulsterites deserve their self-determination? If reunification with the commonwealth was what they truly desired, then who was he to stand in their way?\n\nIt was a conundrum that the Prime Minister had been grappling with for hours now. Glancing outside his window, he noticed with some shock that the sun was beginning to set. He knew that continuing to argue in circles with himself was pointless.

We're looking at an angry reich, an Ireland that will never forgive us - and a hornet's nest worth of paramilitaries who will be fighting us for decades."\n\n"Well put," rumbled Macmillan, thoughtfully. "But nevertheless - I think I'm for it. Ireland is a shade of grey off from being a Reichskommissariat - far more dependent upon the Germans than we ever were, even in our darkest hour. In effect, bringing Ulster back into the fold is keeping it out of Nazi hands. It's a Reich that's one county weaker than it would be otherwise -it's one county less resources that can be leveraged against England should it come to that. And yes, perhaps we will be fighting to hold it - but we have to fight somewhere, do we not?

Thatcher asked, "They want to join us, and I don't quite see why we shouldn't let them join."\n\n"Well, it's the Irish themselves, ma'am," he said, "While Paisley might want to rejoin, Ulster is a volatile region, and many might not share the same sentiments and react violently. There's also the Republic in the south to consider; they might not appreciate so brazen a power play."\n\n"I'm not terribly concerned about Ireland's displeasure," the Prime Minister said, voice dry.\n\n"And neither am I, ma'am, but Ireland is still a member of the Einheitspakt," Pym reasoned, "The Germans might not care for us expanding into an area that they nominally protect."\n\nThatcher hummed.

In any event, that was not going to happen.\n\n"Hello?" Lemass sounded mildly confused as he grabbed the tube.\n\n"Sir, this is superintendent Carroll." The voice of the Garda's chief Dublin officer was unknown to Lemass, but he did know him by name. "There has been an incident at East Wall, some stupid student tried trowing rocks at one of our men... the officers might have overreacted." No response came from Lemass at first, who was busy concealing the noise of his yawn. "Sir, the news has broken, there are major demonstrations at the docks and in other industrial districts, nothing that we can't handle with a few extra men, but they are getting violent... Oh, at the University too, the students have holed themselves in, some of the bastards are running around looting stores, tearing down monuments, even throwing zhdanovs at the Germany embassy!\n\nAnother problem was not what Lemass needed, much less at this time of the day. "Very well then, superintendent... fix it! What do you want me to do? Do you want a blank cheque?" A few quick flashbacks brought Lemass back to 1916, when he was a student fighting for something... but that something was much more respectable than whatever this bunch of morons were up to. "Then you have it. Go on then, disperse the bastards... Use as many officers as need be." After the superintendent gave some affirmatory reply, Lemass hung up the phone.

Spending his days investigating vehicular infractions almost made him wish he hadn't made it out of Ulster during the revolution, it was a demeaning fate. Today, at least, it could be a bit more interesting.\n\nThe bloody students had taken over Trinity College, and all the officers not already engaged in putting down looters had been called to take it back. One thing Doherty was noticing on the way there from Garda HQ, was that the siren on his Daimler W111 was exuding little authority. All around him there were garda officers trying to chase down arsonists and looters, the sound of occasional gunfire. All in all, it reminded him of Belfast. Indeed, the city reassembled the northern counties more and more the closer he got to his destination, taking a turn right on Lesson street, he ran into a barricade. Backing up, he decided to take the alternative route through Hatch street, another barricade.\n\nDoherty now headed back in the opposite direction, going back where he came from, when he spotted that that road was seeing its own barricade being constructed by a group of students. Determined not to be trapped in this little corner of Dublin, he pressed his pedal on the accelerator. The angry Mercedes looked set to crash through the hastily erected boxes until Doherty noticed it: The indistinguishable muzzle flash of a machine gun. Swiveling hard to the right, Doherty crashed into a lamp post as the bullet holes filled the side of his patrol car.

Some fled, and, as expected, one aimed his shotgun at the crowd, and was promptly shot by a Saor Éire sniper parapetted at the nearby cricket club. With that, violence broke loose. The marchers swelled forward, some falling to the erratic gunfire and rubber bullets of the doomed policemen. Then, they headed for the building itself, with the help of armed Saor Éire commandos.

While he privately scoffed at the sight of some lampposts and buildings which flew red flags alongside the tricolor, he had gotten used to tolerating such imagery after twenty years of keeping up the charade to keep the fragile Saor Éire together.\n\nGoulding, on the other hand, was fawning at all the communistic paraphernalia that polluted the streets of Ireland's capital. Admittedly, Twomey thought, the communists were a brave bunch, they had resisted the Germans from the very start, without their help, the revolution would have been impossible. And then, Goulding himself, unmistakably a good man, no doubt about that: He believed in national sovereignty, in Ireland, and for that he would be remembered fondly.\n\nA sudden thud broke through the cheerful atmosphere. The unmistakable sound of a bullet sent the crowd - already jittery from the previous month's upheaval - scattering. Twomey himself jolted: Being so close to gunfire was never easy, even when one expected it. Worse yet, the sniper's bullet had spilled President Goulding's brains all over the kubelwagen.

"In 1943, with their joining of the Axis Powers, the Republic of Ireland was subjected to the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, barring all trade with it. After the war, Ireland has been deemed subject to TWEA, as it remained a staunch ally of Nazi Germany. Today, however, after high level negotiations, Ireland has agreed to a mutual thaw of relations with the United States of America, and as such, will not be pursuant to the TWEA."\n\nThis was real news, more than some briefing on foreign aid. Cameras flashed as the spokesperson continued "the Secretary of State and the State Department have concluded that Ireland is no longer a threat to the interests of America or her allies, and the strict sanctions against it are not necessary. Ireland has actively engaged with the United States, and thus the reason for sanctions is no longer applicable. Rather, from this point forward, the United States will allow more favorable deals with Ireland as a condition for further alignment with American interests."\n\nThe briefing caught the interest of many think tanks and policymakers, but was not noticed by many outside of Washington or Wall Street. In Ireland, however, the briefing was put on television at the top of the hour as a special report. Many in Dublin were happy, and many bottles of champagne were uncorked that night.

Even when the structure began to rise, people still didn't believe that the Americans were really going to invest in the country.\n\nMagnavox simply decided to move to Ireland for the most basic of reasons. Magnavox had strong sales of televisions in Europe for years, driven by a strong market in Wales and Scotland. With Ireland opened up to American trade, they felt they could muscle in on what had previously been the exclusive ground of Siemens and offer the people there a choice as well. A European factory in Ireland could save on shipping costs and take advantage of lower labor costs. And anything not sold on the emerald isle could be shipped easily to other European markets.\n\nSo, Magnavox was happy with their investment. The engineers, assembly workers, electricians, janators, secretaries, and the transport companies of Cork are happy to collect a paycheck in these trying times. The families of those who work at the factory are happy for the security the factory provides. And many people around the island are happy to own an Irish-manufactured television as good as one shipped from the States."

"I heard the shipyard workers down at Hog Island were making a sandwich with Italian bread and various other things inside. They started eating them at my construction sites, and I tried one, and I could see why they liked it. 'Hoagie' is still a dumb name, though."\n\n"I suppose it is, ambassador," said Lemass as he took a bite of his. "Though I'm sure a sandwich such as this one would catch on wherever it was invented. Now, shall we talk about what I'd like you to know?"\n\n"Lets see," said McCloskey, "you invite the American ambassador for lunch and give him some of his regional food after hardly speaking to him for years, so it's obvious you wanna get on his good side. Is that right?"\n\nLemass nodded. "It's obvious our relationship with Germany has not been for the better, economically speaking. We're interested in loosening our binds to them, and improving economic ties to America. Though, to do that, we have to get some of the restrictions on Pakt countries removed or lessened for us."\n\nMcCloskey chewed that over. "So. . .we're talking about the neutralization of a member of the Pakt, then? That might be worth the effort, then. I'll tell the President, and make some moves behind the scenes to get you what you want. I should have enough wheels greased in the R-Ds to get things rolling."\n\nLemass realised what the Ambassador was talking about. "Wait, do you mean bribery?"\n\n"Course not," McCloskey said. "I did enough fundraising for them, they owe me one. Making John Kennedy's career, giving them the hundred-dollar fundraising dinner, they'll see the sense in helping me out on this."

IRE_recovery.4.desc:0 "Mr President,\n\nI feel it is best to keep you abreast of a recent development in Irish-American relations, one that seems to hint at a realignment of the nation, and bring it in line with the OFN.\n\nIreland has long been firmly in the Pakt block, with total economic and foreign policy alignment with Germany. However, there has been substantial political opposition to this, especially among the increasingly popular Fine Gael opposition party. The German Civil War has accelerated this, with German investment drying up, and a massive economic crash resulting. With its primary benefactor gone, it seems Taoiseach Seán Lemass, the Irish PM, has seen the folly of total reliance on the Reich and is looking for economical opportunities outside the Pakt.\n\nAs such, Lemass has been making maneuvers to pursue a more neutral foreign and economic policy, one which relies more on trade with the United States and other nations in the OFN as well as with Germany. He has removed restrictions on American goods from being imported into the nation and has asked that we remove restrictions on trade with Ireland and allow American companies and individuals to invest in his nation. Also, he has made overtures to us talking about a potential split from the Pakt in the future.\n\nWe shouldn't keep our hopes up, though. The nation still has many ties with Germany, and the possibility of them joining the OFN is still small and remote. However, we scarcely get the opportunity to make money while influencing a nation on the peripheries of the Pakt. I have recommended, along with the State Department, the removal of some of the more burdensome restrictions toward investment in Ireland. Many corporations in the US are already making plans to move into the nation, so I suggest we move quickly to get our foot in the door.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew McCloskey\n\nUnited States Ambassador to Ireland"

However, according to a new report by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the tourism industry in particular has seen a massive boost in income, and is now performing better than before the Recession. Experts all point to a singular reason: visitors from North America.\n\nWith the loosening of restrictions on trade and commerce with the Organization of Free Nations, many people are taking the opportunity to visit Ireland. According to the report, bookings on Aer Lingus from the United States to Ireland have more than quadrupled, and the airline has expanded the number of flights from America to accommodate. Hotels have seen a massive increase in stays, with boosts in popularity around the winter holidays and St. Patrick's Day.\n\n"By 1970, current trends show that Ireland's hospitality sector will double in size," said Elena MacGeraghty, a spokeswoman from the Department's Tourism section. "The trend will be driven almost entirely by visitors from the United States and Canada, while tourists from Germany or other nations will remain at the same level or decrease. We find visitors of Irish heritage are the biggest market for this sector, and not only do they visit more than other tourists, they stay longer, travel more, and spend more money."\n\nSpeaking on Trinity College's Campus, tourist Harry Stenbeck from Fort Wayne, Indiana, agreed with that assessment. "This trip was a gift for my wife, who's from a heavily Irish-Catholic background," he said. "And practically everyone else on my tour is from the States as well, with a lot of O'Sheas and MacCarthys. It's a beautiful country, and I'm certain you'll be getting some return visitors from this group too!""

A narrator tells the viewer the land of Ireland is an extremely beautiful and wondrous place. But then he rhetorically asks about the people who live there.\n\nThe show goes back in time, where a young cartoon Saint Patrick is snatched away by a group of swarthy pirates, who take him to Ireland. There, as a shepherd, he and his lamb are constantly threatened by evil snakes until he is saved by a local girl. She teaches him the Song of the Magic Isle, which is the show's main musical number. With her help, Patrick escapes the island, and then later returns and chases the snakes into the sea. This is followed by segments focusing on medieval monks writing illuminated manuscripts and a short humorous segment on Irish folk music, provided by Irish-American folk group The Clancy Brothers.\n\nNow, the program switches back to present day live action, as the animated 1800s Dublin fades into the modern, real city. The next segment takes the viewer to the factories of Ireland, as the narrator tells us that Ireland is no longer the agrarian landscape it was in the past. The last few minutes are focused on the various research activities going on in many fields in Ireland's colleges and institutes. Then, we get more shots of the landscape as a chorus sings the Song of the Magic Isle to close the program.\n\nSo concludes Disney's new mixed media short "The Isle of Magic."

Doubtless, you have heard of Ireland's troubled history and economic issues before coming here, and I cannot tell you these have been myths. Ireland is a young country, still struggling to take off. But what you have seen and heard is a small slice of Ireland's potential to eventually soar. So when you leave here, I wish that you would remember this potential, and remember that all you have seen can be experienced every day in Ireland, making it a pleasant place not just to invest in, but to work as well.\n\nNow, before I go, I wish to remind you that we are planning a series of exhibitions just like the one you have seen here along the upper east coast of the United States. The Park Avenue Armory has agreed to host one in New York City, and we expect to close a deal with venues in Boston and a Canadian location shortly. This will be a governmentally funded venture, though sponsorships are available, and Jameson Irish Whiskey and American Airlines have signed on to be the lead ones.

No, now was the time for decisive action. His plan had been picked, it was now time to tell the world about it.\n\nChecking his wristwatch, the Tánaiste saw that it was time to begin. MacEntee cleared his throat. "People of Ireland," he began, "Ireland stands before you today, a humbled nation. The Emerald Isle is harrowed, nearly cast down, as the world falls to pieces. Many of our citizens are destitute, savings accumulated over years gone in an instant, and many of our most vulnerable have lost much more."\n\nMacEntee paused, giving his words time to sink in. "And yet," he continued, "Ireland still stands. Though we may be bruised and battered, we have not fallen. My fellow countrymen, my friends, we have survived. The worst is over. Now, it is time to look ahead."\n\nThe Tánaiste leaned forwards. "All of Ireland's economic woes can be traced back to one point, one figure, one nation: the Germans. The Germans took over all sectors of our economy, peddled their goods in our markets, and ran roughshod over our native population. Now," he said, pounding his fist on the podium, "It is time for Ireland to take back what is hers! The Germans abandoned us; if they no longer want to maintain what they made in Ireland, then we can maintain it for them. The Republic will begin to repossess German assets that were abandoned during the crash, giving the wealth of the Emerald Isle back to her people.

Production numbers are up, faith in the economy is at its highest point since the crash, and all our projections keep pointing that way. People are beginning to invest in Ireland again, even people outside the country are starting to take interest again."\n\nIt was all that the Tánaiste could do not to cheer. This was even better than MacEntee had hoped. "How are the Germans taking our repossession efforts?" he asked.\n\n"Well," Lynch replied, "They haven't really said much. As we predicted, the Germans have bigger issues than some seized factories that they aren't even in any state to use. Your average German probably cares very little about Ireland, but your average Irishman cares very much about it indeed."\n\nLemass sighed, slumping forward in his seat.

These suspicions are known to the Irish government, and the Abwehr, but because this man is good at his job he is able to still do it unhindered. Though his job is less the secretive assassinations and infiltrations that have caught the fancy of the population. He instead places a small envelope underneath the table, taping it to the underside. After finishing his meal and paying the check, he leaves, without anything unusual being detected.\n\nFor an hour, nothing unusual happens. Until another customer in a suit arrives and sits down at the table. He reaches down without looking, and picks the small envelope up, placing it into their pocket. This person is the recipient of the message. They are not American, nor a CIA employee, but as Irish as the rest of the customers and staff of this establishment. This envelope contains a reward for the services they have done for the CIA, and a request for more.\n\nWhat is in the envelope? Money? A plane ticket? Or some information extremely pertinent to the person? No one knows. And they could just as easily be eager to supplement their income, as they could be motivated by a hatred for the Pakt or a desire to bring their family to the prosperous new world. And these reasons make Ireland the backdoor of the Pakt for the CIA.\n\nEverything that the Irish know about gets out eventually. And mostly in drop offs such as this one, happening all over the nation."

He looked once more before walking away from the window and into his bedroom. Unlike the much more spacious flats of downtown Dublin, the flat had only two rooms and a bathroom. Small, but liveable thought Ted. As he was in his bedroom, he opened his closet, and pulled out a wooden crate that was buried in the back behind hanging pants and jackets. Inside was a typewriter and letters, all with the same address, Sixteenth Garden Lane, Dublin. The location of German Intelligence in Ireland. No-one questioned it, it served as the regional headquarters of one of those mega-corporations.\n\nTed began to type away, as a part of his day job as a civil servant serving the Garda and the government as a whole. Due to this, he had all the access in the world to all of the papers and reports that would go into the archives. Anything that would go into the archives, or to the government itself would need to pass through Ted first. Who would suspect him anyways? He was nothing more than a paperpusher trying to climb his way in the cutthroat world of politics. It was the perfect crime.\n\nHis job was easy, writing reports to the Germans detailing the efforts of the Garda on American agents. So far, it had been extremely underwhelming. Again and again the Garda had been duped by the much better trained and supplied CIA. Each week he would write a more damning report to the Germans. Not like he would care, he was getting paid. That was his motivation. He finished typing up the report and slid it into its envelope. He placed it inside the box and put it back into his closet, and looked back outside the window. They had no idea what was coming did they? He thought to himself."

With shop fronts boarded up and the muffled city life, that usually could be heard at this time of the night, all but gone. Hope bit the dust behind all the closed doors, and despair had swept in swiftly to fill its place. Indeed, it was an empty and lifeless place to be left in.\n\nDanny thought that, in some weird way, he was no different to each of these abandoned buildings. He too had been ditched by everyone around him the moment the realisation of economic chaos had set in. Though those who had already left had gone on to a far better place, at least that is what he imagined. Nevertheless, they had gone and he was left behind to rot.\n\nOne of the only comforts Danny could find in the midst of it all was the assurance that it could not possibly get any worse. The sheer amount of discontent and devastation would have to get the attention of those in power. Surely they would realise the need for change, they could not go on allowing him, and the rest of Ireland, to be beaten like this. A better country would surely form from all the insanity and confusion.\n\nYet that promise was not as comforting as he had first thought.\n\nThose who had allowed the collapse to happen appeared to be in charge of the recovery. Again Danny asked himself where the hope of the last few years had bought him. And given the bleak reality he endured he cast doubt on any optimism once more.\n\nWhy should he think the next era would be any better, let alone any different, from the last?"

Yet to every worker's continuing despair, prices continued to become steeper and steeper, while their incomes remained meager.

There was no choice but to ignore their constant aching in their half starved stomachs, all the while knowing that all this was not their fault.

So a great deal of pride had been swallowed before the members of the Dáil convened to attempt to work together for once.\n\nStanding in his usual position inside the Dáil, Lemass began his speech with a bold, or perhaps more of an unwitting, comment, "I'm glad you all have finally come round to my way of thinking."\n\n"Oh for heaven's sake sod off Lemass, get on with it man."\n\nThe Taoiseach scowled into the crowd of TDs who were assembled, trying in vain to pick out who had spoken out in such a brash manner. Failing to find the culprit, he pressed on with the more urgent matters at hand.\n\n"As I am sure we are all aware, the current economic situation has deteriorated far beyond what any of us could have, er, anticipated. Now we must work together to turn this sinking ship around, or try and bailout what we can."\n\nNot one man expected for the following to be easy, however the reality that they had all agreed to at least attempt a fix of the waning economy was enough to usher in a hope for a fundamentally different future.

Better that he was in command than some crank from outside Fianna Fáil, he thought as he stood up to take his seat in the Dáil.\n\nAfter the strained business of facing the Dáil was over with, Lemass headed hastily to the destination of the looming meeting, all the while going over the plans he had made earlier that day. And once the hour of the party congress had arrived, the taoiseach's delivery was thoroughly rehearsed.\n\n"The entire nation stands at a crossroads, and we, in the Fianna Fáil, are the ones most trusted to lead them toward a brighter age. There is no doubt that the fortunes of the people of Ireland have fallen foul to a spectacular downwards spiral, in which we empathise greatly. These peoples' futures demand that we, as a party take action; now, my accomplished colleague, deputy Ryan, has already put forward such a thorough plan for action that will assuredly usher in the new economic age. All I ask from you, as members of Fianna Fáil, is to back this deal and end this madness."\n\nA tired ripple of applause came up from the party members in reply, nothing like as resounding a response as Lemass had hoped for.

If the man was not of such importance to the government, he would have swung back in a much less literary manner. But even that would not have removed the nagging in the back of his mind that constantly questions if what he did, and carries on doing, is right.\n\n"I've done nothing but what's best for Ireland at all times, and I plan to continue doing just that," the growingly despondent Taoiseach responded. "Now, er, let's just move on to what we can do now, rather than whatever any of us did not do in the past, huh? For starters, we really need to start letting the Americans invest in Ireland."\n\n"And allow for this whole cycle to repeat with the US instead of the Germans? I'd rather hope not." McAntee shot back. "We need to rely on no one but ourselves, that way this chaos will never come back to haunt us."\n\nCorish nodded with slight approval; seeing this, Lemass tried to keep his face from dropping in despair. Nothing ever came easy in Ireland, but this was ridiculous. Hammering out a new economic policy was going to be a herculean task, and Lemass knew he had vanishingly little willingness to overcome such an obstacle. Though he was not about to let his growing hopelessness catch on, he had always been a fighter, so to fight was his only option if he were to hang on."

Weren't they supposed to be a democracy? Why couldn't Ireland expel the Nazi advisors and stand up to the hun like Scotland or Wales had? The obvious answer was if they did, the Germans would swoop down and capitulate them in a week, so that was out of the question.\n\nThe German Civil War changed that calculus.\n\nAt this point, with the economic crash and preoccupation of the Nazis, Ireland had been granted a golden opportunity. She could slip her bounds blamelessly and once more be a free nation. And yet. . .she would not. It didn't make sense to the boys from Balbriggan that Ireland would choose to stay in the Pakt. Perhaps no nation would dare risk upsetting the hold the Germans still had?\n\nEngland did, and that changed the calculus.\n\nIt was an outright embarrassment. Scotland had stood up. Wales had stood up. The bloody English were standing up. And the most historically abused, maltreated, forlorn people of the isles had decided to purchase their lives and peace with chains and slavery. This was not what the schools had told them an Irishman was. How could they reconcile the image of a brave fighter for freedom with the downtrodden men who went along with whatever their master ordered them to?\n\nThey couldn't. And they were going to live that ideal if nobody else would.\n\nOne day, the boys disappeared, along with a motor launch from the harbor, two shotguns, a hunting rifle, a revolver, and a library book detailing the lighthouses of the British isles.

German goods in our stores. German vehicles on our roads. Even when we celebrate our troops when they march down the streets, they have German equipment and German-trained officers. Our government is made up of a sole ruling party, and they do whatever the Germans want. In essence, we have traded our occupation and colonization by the English for a de facto colonization by the Germans.\n\nI know, maybe I shouldn't question it. My father does business with the Germans. And he's made money off of it. Money that has gotten my family things we wouldn't have otherwise. Money that has given me the quality of life I enjoy today. But I heard something about where that money comes from. That there are camps filled with slaves, and that's where all our goods, our equipment, our vehicles come from.\n\nI'm not sure. They say it's lies, and the British mistreated the peoples under their rule as well. But I know what the Germans have done to London, Warsaw, and Rotterdam, and I can only imagine what they are doing to Africa and Siberia right now. The Spanish and Rome itself wants nothing to do with them, and aren't they as Catholic as I am?

He shook his head at the notion. He wanted to get his own way, just as the others did, but this wasn't the time to be a partisan within his own party.\n\n"There is such a thing as a good plan done poorly.

Likewise, there is such a thing as a bad plan done well - perhaps the plan we choose won't be the one that pleases you personally, but Ireland will be better off if we work together to see the best version of that policy implemented.

However, he now found the decision was extremely hard, as the options were limited and the party would be behind him no matter which one he picked.\n\nThe first plan in front of him was the Tanaiste's plan. Sean Macentee wanted to take control of the rising deficit and trade gap. In his mind, Ireland had been too reliant on foreign trade, and the German stranglehold had ended up killing it when the foreign trade had gone away. Strict protectionism would be put into place to prevent such a thing from ever happening again. As for the budget shortfall, any decrease in revenue would be made up for with a decrease in spending.\n\nBrendan Corish, on the other hand, thought austerity was the exact opposite way to solve the problem. The main problem wasn't that the government did not have money to spend, it was the people of Ireland not having any either. Under his plan, a set of relief programs aimed at the lower and middle class would be put into place, with the goal of giving them what they needed to bear the brunt of the crisis and eventually start spending again.\n\nThese plans had their merits, but. . .perhaps Lemass knew better? He had done some thinking of his own, and he felt there was a more simple solution to the crisis, one that did not require large deficits or unpopular spending cuts. Now that Germany was in a series of violent death throes, who could stop Ireland from making some favorable deals with the OFN? Then they would fill the gap and never rely solely on the Germans again.\n\nIn the end, Lemass decided just before going to bed, and would inform the rest of the government in the morning."

 IRE_flavor.1.desc:0 "On Easter Sunday 1916, a group of Irish patriots under the command of Patrick Pearse and James Connolly occupied the General Post Office of Dublin and proclaimed an independent Irish Republic. Although the fledgling nation lasted only a week before being cruelly crushed by the British Army and the leaders were executed, their martyrdom inspired their compatriots and resulted in the Irish War of Independence. Some would even say that the Easter Rising was the true beginning of our war of independence.\n\nNeedless to say, the fiftieth anniversary of such an event is something that we cannot afford to ignore. The men who once fought in the Rising are not getting any younger, and President De Valera is one of the last surviving leaders. There are already plans to create a committee that would organize the festivities, for both the day of Easter 1966 and for events leading up to it. While a great deal of attention can be afforded to it, there is the question of just how much it should receive. On one hand, being vigorous with our involvement e be an excellent way to shore up public support for the President and Fianna Fáil. But on the other, it could draw ire from those who see it as frivolous, not to mention embolden some more... vociferous patriots in the Republic and Ulster."

 IRE_flavor.2.desc:0 "The amount of monuments in Dublin to commemorate the Easter Rising is rather slim; the only one of note is a statue of the death mythical hero Cúchulainn inside the General Post Office. The committee has identified the need for an open, public memorial space that can remind the people of Dublin of their countrymen's sacrifice for freedom, as well as the need for beautification in downtown Dublin in general.\n\nA corner of Rotunda Gardens, in Parnell Square, has already been earmarked on account of its historical significance: it's where the Irish Volunteers were founded in 1913, and where several of the Easter Rising's leaders were briefly detained before being sent to Kilmainham Gaol. A design by architect Dáithí Hanly has been approved, and ground will be broken next week. However, the major question is what exactly should be commemorated: just the fallen of the 1916 rising, or earlier anti-British rebellions. The United Irishmen of 1798, Robert Emmet in 1803, Young Ireland in 1848, and the Fenian Rising of 1867 all lack similar public memorials, and it would be a boon to public relations if the cause of the Rising were presented as the fulfillment of these earlier rebellions."

Although Emmet was executed by the British more than a century before the Rising, furthering the association between such lauded heroes and the modern Republic is a boon that cannot be understated.\n\nAn area of open land known as the Bully's Acre is said to be the final resting place of Emmet, though his body has never actually been discovered. Nevertheless, it will make a good location for a memorial. However, the question still remains of what exactly to engrave as an epitaph? Should he be extolled as a martyr for the cause of self-determination, or as a patriot who wanted Irish unity?"

They cited examples from recent English and American history of minting commemorative coins to celebrate important anniversaries, and it is not an idea without merit.\n\nA new denomination and design have already been voted upon by the committee: a silver ten-shilling coin, the highest face value of a coin yet, designed by artist T. Hugh Paget featuring an image of Patrick Pearse on the obverse the Cúchulainn memorial on the reverse. Ideally, two million of them would be minted and distributed for public circulation, but minting would stop in 1967 and no further coins of that denomination will be produced.\n\nWhile it has been approved by the planning committee and received warmly by many others in the government, some think that it would be folly to create a new denomination of coins only for one year in limited numbers.

It had always been a source of contention and a target of ire for Irish nationalists: during the Easter Rising, the Irish Republicans attempted to demolish the Pillar to no avail. Petitions and bills to have it dismantled or relocated have continually cropped up in the last half-century, but they continually faced opposition from the Pillar Trust, which owns the memorial, and the Dáil's unwillingness to bother drafting legislation to enforce it.\n\nAnd now, nearly fifty years after the first attempt at toppling it, some enterprising citizens have taken the matter into their own hands. The upper half of the pillar was severed and fell to the ground due to the blast, which caused surprisingly little damage to surrounding buildings and vehicles. The statue of Nelson that topped the pillar lies shattered, its surviving fragments severely damaged in the fall. The Gardai is unsurprisingly looking into potential involvement by the nationalist rebel group Saor Éire, but their progress seems unlikely. Public opinion ranges from indifferent to celebratory, but the probability that it was done by armed paramilitaries does deserve some form of condemnation."

Festivities began beneath the morning sun in downtown Dublin, where a long parade of Garda officers and Defense Force soldiers marched down O'Connell Street, followed by nearly a thousand surviving veterans who fought in the Rising. Crowds cheered, medals were issued, and President De Valera was (unsurprisingly) overseeing all the festivities from a stand set up in front of the General Post Office. Some noted the conspicuous absences of politicians like Lynch, Flanagan, and Corish, and speculated whether it was an intentional snub by the President.\n\nLater in the day, the center of the ceremonies shifted a bit outside of the city epicenter, to the former prison of Kilmainham Gaol. It was here numerous Irish nationalists, including De Valera himself, served time for opposing the British, and it was also here that sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed by firing squad. The President toured the facilities, recently rehabilitated thanks to a campaign by private citizens, announced the opening of a history museum on the grounds, and concluded ceremonies by laying a wreath for the fallen in the execution yard."

Next came a trip to Parnell Square, where he officially inaugurated the new Garden of Remembrance in its northern corner. Excepting a few announcements about other government initiatives, such as a list of railway stations that were being renamed to honor Irish freedom fighters, the remaining ceremonies were largely uneventful.\n\nThe overall reception for the semicentenary have largely been positive, with plenty of praise coming in for the organizing committee. There are De Valera's critics, as always, who claim he was trying to build a cult of personality around himself, but they were in a clear minority. However, some fear that it resonated a little too well with the common folk. And when there is talk of nationalism, it draws people's minds northward, to the delicate situation in Ulster.

Parking in front of one of the rows of townhouses, a group of armed men got out of the busses and took positions. Some covered the streetside, while others entered the building.\n\nThis was an extraction of an informant there was good reason to believe had been compromised. Not exactly an unheard of affair for the Northern Irish Constabulary in a Protestant neighborhood, but one that had to be performed with perfection each time. Every one of these maneuvers was designed to prevent any unwanted complications, and to show the Protestants who were really in charge. Because the UVF would take every opportunity to test their defences.\n\nAnd such an incident happened that day. As the informant was being led out of the building, a car full of young men came down the street and was noticed by the ones on guard outside the parked convoy. That was suspicious. Even more so when they parked right next to the convoy. The constabulary officers were more than aware of what could come next. And when the passenger door of the car opened, they took no chances.\n\nDid they have any weapons? Who were the boys anyway? No matter, there was no time to wait.

Adrenaline racing through his veins, he prepared to give the sermon a coup de grâce by finishing of with a denounciation of sodomy, but he was interrupted by the sound of gunfire.\n\nQuite often, the IRA or Saor Éire would try to interrupt his meetings, that wasn't new, UVF men surrounding the church usually took care of them after a short skirmish. Nevertheless, with the gunfire getting louder and louder, Paisley decided not to extend the sermon further: No point in risking his own people.\n\nWhen he stood down from the pulpit to oversee the safe vacation of the church, Paisley heard the faintest hint of another noise: A hum. Paying no attention to it, he encouraged all those present to return to their homes in an orderly fashion, while the hum - as well the gunfire - kept growing louder.\n\nWhile Paisley was hurrying the churchgoers along, the hum broke through the walls, revealing itself as the deafening engine noise of an armored car. Taken aback, Paisley looked in horror as it punched a hole in the church at full speed, overrunning several pews. This wasn't SE harassment: The Dublinites had come after him again - he could even spot the grey figures of distant IDF men through the massive gap the tankette had created.\n\nHis imminent arrest, Paisley believed, would galvanize the protestant population into rebellion.
