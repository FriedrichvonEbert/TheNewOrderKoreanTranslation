IRE_there_will_be_blood:0 "There Will Be Blood"
IRE_there_will_be_blood_desc:0 "The recent bombings in Northern Ireland have struck at the hearts of those who live in Ireland, especially those who reside in the areas close to Ulster that have large ammounts of Protestant populations as well. In the minds of most of the population, it is almost a certainty that whatever happens over in Ulster will happen over in Ireland eventually as retaliation. The population in these areas is panicked about this, fearing that they may die in an attack by secular terrorists. There is some hope that this situation could be resolved or avoided in the upcoming conference with Ulster."
IRE_humiliation_of_a_giant:0 "Humiliation of a Giant"
IRE_humiliation_of_a_giant_desc:0 "For most of Ireland's short history, the Fianna Fáil Party has held control of Ireland, and with a fairly comfortable majority in the Dáil. Even as the political situation outside the party devolved into violence and clashes throughout the '50s, de Valera continued to hold power with tight media controls and centralizing powers around the Ceannaire. However, nothing lasts forever, and a strong showing by Fine Gael has forced Fianna Fáil out of a majority. While still the largest party, they are now struggling to find a path forward to ensure their agenda can still get done."
IRE_not_much_to_gain_mr_hitler:0 "Not Much to Gain, Mr. Hitler"
IRE_not_much_to_gain_mr_hitler_desc:0 "People say that Ireland was on the winning side of the Second World War, but it doesn't feel like it in Ireland. The free world and the OFN wants nothing to do with a pakt nation, and to them, the island is essentially a non-entity. Having its economy tied to Germany has proved a disaster, with it being in stagnation since the German crash. And worst of all, it can't do anything about the situation. By joining the winning side of the war, Ireland has lost far more."
IRE_political_paranoia_has_its_consequences:0 "Political Paranoia Has Its Consequences"
IRE_political_paranoia_has_its_consequences_desc:0 "Tensions in Fianna Fáil have exploded since the defeat in the Dáil elections in 1961. Conservatives under Seán Lemass hate what they deem "cosmopolites." This faction under John Mary "Jack" Lynch has an equal disdain for the supporters of Neil Blaney. And the "Blaneyboys" hate the other two factions of the party with a burning passion. Éamon de Valera is the only one holding the extremely fractured party together, at least according to him. An outsider might come to the conclusion that perhaps de Valera's attempts to strongman his own party may have led to this massive outrage..."
IRE_giant_with_only_one_ally:0 "Giant With Only One Ally"
IRE_giant_with_only_one_ally_desc:0 "What was once unthinkable in Ireland has finally happened. Fianna Fáil has approached the Labour party and formed a coalition government, checking the right-wing Fine Gael in the Dáil with a majority. Seán Lemass successfully convinced de Valera that an alliance between FF and Labour would create a popular front government that would save Irish democracy from a fascist Fine Gael takeover. With the most pressing problem out of the way, the new coalition government is now free to work on the upcoming Ulster conference."

IRE_giant_tries_to_go_alone_desc:0 "De Valera won out with his argument with Seán Lemass about the future of Fianna Fáil. It won't sully itself by making any form of coalition government, instead just bringing a few independents on board to make a majority government. De Valera and Lemass don't need Labour to tell them what to do. Sure, the Ulster conference might go terribly, and the government might be going in a bit unprepared, but who cares? FF will show everyone why they are the largest party in Ireland."
IRE_all_alone:0 "All Alone"
IRE_all_alone_desc:0 "There's several Germanies now, and all are drowned in flame. Ireland now stands on the periphery of the Pakt, alone and isolated. The OFN won't accept Ireland into the OFN, especially with the same government in power that attacked Ulster in the Second World War. The island is economically isolated and defenseless. But on the flip side, it is independent and free to decide its own destiny."

What happens next will decide the course that the island is set upon for the future."

POLITICS_Eamon_De_Valera_desc:0 "A veteran of almost fifty years of service to the Irish state, Eamon de Valera has more than any other man come to personify the struggles of modern Ireland. When the young statesman was arrested and slated to be executed in 1917 following the disastrous Easter rising, few could have imagined the heights to which he would rise. Saved only by his American citizenship, de Valera did not shy away from the republican cause following this near death experience, becoming an MP that very year. Despite leading the ultimately unsuccessful anti-treaty faction of the Irish civil war, de Valera quickly rebounded, founding Fianna Fáil in 1926 and leading the party to a string of electoral victories. \n\nBy the mid 1950s, however, the toll of 30 years at the helm had finally begun to show. Threatened by the fascist Fine Gael party, De Valera and Fianna Fáil ruled with an increasingly heavy hand, tightening restrictions on the press and freedom of expression. In the paranoid atmosphere now suffocating Dublin, de Valera has surrounded himself with a cabal of old guard republicans, constantly devising plans to destroy their enemies while the economic and social situation in Ireland continues to deteriorate. Not content with the multitude of outside enemies surrounding the aging Taoiseach, de Valera's increasing paranoia and authoritarianism has alienated many within his own party, giving rise to a rival faction coalescing around the reformist Seán Lemass. \n\nWith support for fascist parties continuing to grow and the much-anticipated Ulster conference casting its shadow over Dublin, De Valera will need to be at his sharpest to have a hope of guiding his nation through the coming storm, but with the statesman now approaching his 90th birthday and almost totally blind, fewer and fewer glimpses of that fiery young radical can be caught behind his tired eyes."

WORLD.1988.desc:0 "Ireland has rejoiced at the news coming out of the conference between the governments of Ireland and Ulster. Supposedly reunited at the end of the Second World War, Northern Ireland has really been ruled by an autonomous government backed up by the remnants of British forces there.\n\nA conference to try and resolve the long-standing issues has met with unexpected success, with the government of Ulster agreeing to reunification in exchange for several concessions. The population is celebrating at the news of this agreement, but experts are skeptical if this is truly the end of the situation in Ireland."

WORLD.1989.desc:0 "The status quo in Ireland looks to continue for the foreseeable future, as talks between Ireland and Ulster have failed to make progress. Ulster, a de facto independent state made out of formerly British-occupied Northern Ireland, has been unable to come to an agreement with the South where they would be reintegrated into Ireland.\n\nExperts have always believed the differences between the two powers have been irreconcilable, but fear that now the sectarian violence in the two nations will worsen."

They have announced they will never submit to Irish rule, trashing every bit of nominal control by the government of Ireland.\n\nExperts believe this will put an end to any hope of a peaceful solution to the situation in Ireland, and expect massive sectarian violence to flare up in both countries, especially along the border area."
