 #Starting Ideas
 ILG_Wild_Frontier:0 "The Wild Frontier"
 ILG_Wild_Frontier_desc:0 "As an unofficial military governorate in de jure French territory, we do not receive much attention from Rome. This has essentially rendered us useless and impotent, and our only hope for survival is aid from our Italian brethren."

 ILG_Unofficial_Italian_Settlement:0 "Unofficial Italian Settlement"
 ILG_Unofficial_Italian_Settlement_desc:0 "Due to the fact that the territory is ripe for settlement, many poor Italians have immigrated in the hopes of acquiring land. Needless to say, mass immigration of Italians will only compound our miseries due to our weak hold over the area."

 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Bad:0 "Rampant Banditry"
 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Bad_desc:0 "A limited military presence and a lack of manpower means that bandits constantly raid our convoys and loot settlements. However, it is at a boiling point, as destitute natives flock to their ranks in the hope of emerging out of poverty, thus making Italian control even more difficult to maintain."

 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Crisis:0 "Rampant Banditry"
 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Crisis_desc:0 "A limited military presence and a lack of manpower means that bandits constantly raid our convoys and loot settlements.

 ILG_Saharan_Bandits:0 "Banditry Eliminated"
 ILG_Saharan_Bandits_desc:0 "Banditry has been eradicated from the Saharan provinces of Algeria. While Iberian saboteurs and terrorists still make their raids in the border regions, at least we are able to prevent them from wreaking havoc upon our outposts, convoys, and villages."

 ILG_Military_Boost_1:0 "Basic Desert Training"
 ILG_Military_Boost_1_desc:0 "With some reforms, and some training, our men will be able to fight and govern the sands of Algeria."

 ILG_Provisional_Government:0 "Provisional Government of Algeria"
 ILG_Provisional_Government_desc:0 "With this step forward, we state the right of the peoples of Algeria to form a state, even if the land is nominally French. However, with a bureaucracy and functioning system, Algeria will prosper!"

 ILG.2.a:0 "Dispatch received."

 ILG.3.t:0 "Iberia Attacks!"
 ILG.3.d:0 "The inevitable has finally come to pass: After a short period of complete diplomatic silence from Iberian Algeria, armed militias have been spotted crossing the border in Kabylie, Touggourt, Adrar, and several other regions along the Italian frontier. Although war has not been officially declared by either of our countries, one thing is clear: Iberia has begun a military offensive directly into Italian Algeria.\n\n Upon hearing of the situation, the initial response from mainland Italy has been disappointingly unalarmed — vague promises for extra shipments of equipment and manpower, and sometimes, nothing more than words of support. The ability for our inevitable calls for reinforcement to successfully maneuvere the tense political situation in Rome is not certain, and if the mainland decides that the cost of holding Algeria to be simply too great, it is possible that we may be left with very little, if any, additional support from Italy for the remainder of the war. Adding onto our troubles, this conflict shall certainly exacerbate our already significant issues with banditry; as more and more of our security forces are redirected to the Iberian front, and increasing amounts of our already scant supplies is lost to the scorching Algerian desert, roving hordes of native bandits may find easy opportunities for convoy raiding, further hurting our supply.\n\nIn any case, all of our currently deployed military forces are quickly beginning to mobilize, and any additional militias we can muster are being activated. As our few operational aircraft scramble off their runways, and ragtag groups of native platoons begin their trek through the Algerian desert, many question if we are capable of actually staging an offensive into the Iberian military government to expel their forces from Algeria entirely, and failing that, if we are capable of even repelling the incoming Iberian assault. Regardless, the battle for Algeria has begun. "
 ILG.3.a:0 "We must repel the Iberian Invaders!"

 ILG.7.t:0 "Iberian Algeria Surrenders!"
 ILG.7.d:0 "Through the blood, sweat, and tears of native and Italian forces alike, we have triumphed over Iberia!\n\nWith Italian-Algerian forces marching through Oran, as well as the loss of control of the vast majority of the Algerian desert, Iberia has accepted defeat. It has begrudgingly arranged for all of Iberian Algeria's territorial possessions to be formally turned over to our military governorate, and seeing no other option, the Iberian-Algerian Governor Jorge Jardim has been forced to return to Iberia.\n\nHowever, we are forced to make a difficult decision: In order for any any semblance of stablity to return to the war-torn country, we must end the current military government and replace it with a more permanent political system, one which is hopefully capable of maintaining stabilty and lasting peace.\n\nWe could respect our previously made promises of autononmy to the Algerian people, and establish an Algerian Republic, headed by FLN chairmen Ferhat Abbat. This state, although close to Rome, would be a democratic nation, independent from direct Italian meddling. Although we would cede the ability to directly dominate Algeria, the newly-formed country would continue to be squarely in our sphere of influence, allowing us to retain significant influence on the region.\n\n Alternatively, we could walk back on our promise, and establish an Algerian puppet state under the direct supervision of the native politican Said Boualam. Such a state would remain effectively part of our empire, and would serve as a useful bargaining chip with the French State, as well as provide an extended direct front with the Iberian Union in case of further aggression. However, Boulam is widely disliked by the populace for his anti-independence stances, and such a move could incite the already-high tensions between the current government and the native people to a boil.\n\nWith the future of Algeria in our hands, what decision do we make?"
 ILG.7.a:0 "Algeria shall remain under our direct control."
 ILG.7.b:0 "We must honor our promise to the Algerian people."

 ILG.8.t:0 "Birth of the Algerian Mandate"
 ILG.8.d:0 ""Well then," Pirani said, hope in his voice, "have we reached a mutual agreement?" The conference had been ongoing for several hours now, marked by periods of concessions, affirmations, and a sense of overarching fatigue. The Iberian diplomat looked down for a moment, quickly resetting his gaze squarely on Pirani and the rest of the Italian delegation. \n\n"I suppose so." Several reserved, but still audible sighs could be heard throughout the spacious room. "We'd like to discuss some of the specifics, of course, but yes, we find these conditions palatable." \n\n Word had quickly reached the Duce of the successful conference; as artfully explained to him a few days prior, the proposed plan would have Algeria been ruled under a dual-mandate. Instead of maintaining the vague borders between the various occupation zones, Iberian and Italian soldiers alike would keep the peace, with a functioning democractic state being built on the sands of Algeria, one which represents both native and settled inhabitants in the running of the country. A favorable outcome, of course, the Duce remarked. While there was a plausible chance of Italy winning the war that seemed so inevitable only a short time ago, neither the region nor the expected public outcry against a war made fighting such a war worth it, whether it be in the long or short term.\n\nIn any case, Algeria has been spared the horror of war, but a tulmotulous future awaits it still. If either Iberia or Italy decides to withdraw from the territory, the Duce knew, the remaining country would be forced to choose to either spend significant amounts of resources maintaining it, or to follow suit and abandon Algeria entirely. Still, all of Italy can enjoy the triumph of peace for today."
 ILG.8.a:0 "The best possible option."

 #Leader Description
 POLITICS_GIUSEPPE_CASTELLANO_DESC:0 "주세페 카스텔라노 장군은 아마 이탈리아 왕국 육군 고위층에서 가장 흔한 가십거리일 것입니다. 두 번의 세계대전의 베테랑인 그는 지난 세계 대전 동안 발칸반도에서 뛰어난 활약을 펼쳐 이탈리아 최고사령부 반열에 올랐습니다. 카스텔라노의 야망은 극에 달했지만, 운명을 다른 길로 향했습니다. 전쟁이 끝나고 몇 년 후, 새로운 두체 갈레아초 치아노는 카스텔라노에게 무법천지인 알제리 국경 지역의 감시 역할을 맡겼습니다.\n\n카스텔라노는 현재 몇 년째 알제리 군사령부 수장을 맡고있지만, 그의 지도력은 지역 정세를 개선하는데 그다지 효과적이지 못했습니다. 대부분 시칠리아 출신이라 옛 마피아 가문에 얽매여있는 이탈리아 정착민들은 로마 당국의 감시와 거리가 먼 알제리에 끌렸습니다. 정착민들의 거주지는 알제리 지형에 도배되어 있고, 카스텔라노와 마피아의 관계에 대해 많은 소문이 나돌고 있습니다. 로마가 이베리아 및 피에 누아르 동맹에 맞선 무력 분쟁에서 알제리 원주민 민병대를 지원하기로 결정함에 따라 불안정은 더욱 커지고 있습니다.\n\n알제리에 발이 묶이고 자원이 거의 주어지지 않은 총독은 상황이 자신의 손아귀에서 떠나자 앉아서 지켜볼 수 밖에 없었습니다. 하지만 트리움비라투스에서 긴장이 다시 고조되고, 곧 알제리와 카스텔라노는 다시 한번 주목을 받게 될 지도 모릅니다. 일단 그렇게 되면, 카스텔라노는 이탈리아가 자신을 새롭게 볼 기회를 갖게 될 것입니다. 음습한 거래와 밀실 협상을 이용한 제국의 뒷골목 통치에서부터 수많은 적들로부터 국경지대를 구한 국가의 영웅에 이르기까지."
