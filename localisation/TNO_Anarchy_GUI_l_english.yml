 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_tt: "§oAnarchy§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_tt_delayed: "Long before thinkers like Proudhon and Kropotkin developed the theory of anarchism, there was only one definition for anarchy: chaos. It is what Thomas Hobbes referred to as the "State of Nature," an era of war by all against all, where life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." It was the earliest state of man, from the time of hunter-gatherers, and it was gradually abandoned in favor of the settled agrarian life. And it is a state to which some of mankind has unfortunately returned.\n\nWhether due to continual warfare, natural disaster, or political instability, a region of the world has been left with no governing body able (or willing) to assert its authority. The end result is less a withering away of the state and more a total collapse of all centralized authority. No power extends beyond the outskirts of one's village, and any sort of institution or infrastructure beyond the local level simply does not exist. Those who live outside of the occasional hamlet do so as nomads, hunting and foraging for foods while dodging predators and roaming bandits. It is a lifestyle that does not allow for art, culture, or higher education, because even those who want to pursue those are too busy surviving to focus on thriving. In time, the circumstances that caused this collapse may fade, and civilization can flourish once more. But until then, there will be no gods and no masters here."

 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_Nuclear_tt: "§xThe Nuclear Wastelands§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_ZZZ_Nuclear_tt_delayed: "Once, there was a reason all this happened. A misunderstanding, maybe, or a game of chicken pushed too far, or a war so terrible, so awesome in its scale, that it left those who lived no choice.\n\nThe reasons why are long gone. So are the nations who cared about them, and the leaders who made the fatal decision, and the people who could do nothing but watch. It's all been blown away by the wind, taking billions of stories, structures, souls with it. What remains scrabbles at the ruins for life, and finds none.\n\nHumanity has not been extinguished. Embers cling on to what remains of their forefathers, marveling at now-ancient wonders and ruins, slowly pulling coherence and knowledge from the muck.\n\nIf they're lucky, they may even be able to make the same mistake someday."
 
 TNO_Anarchy_OMO_tt: "§BThe Wilderness of Northeastern Siberia§!"
 TNO_Anarchy_OMO_tt_delayed: "In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, no successor or splinter states have emerged in the most isolated peripheries of Siberia. Without any centralized bureaucracy, infrastructure, industry, large-scale trade, or long-distance communication to unite the region, the villages have largely reverted to the lifestyle they have held for centuries: subsistence farming, hunting, and animal herding. The local Yakut, Eveny, and Chukchi peoples have returned to practicing their shamanistic beliefs free of interference, and the Orthodox Russian villages do not bother to trouble them. The furthest anyone usually goes is over to the next village over, and residents may go many years before hearing a single scrap of news from the outside world.\n\nWhile the region may be rich in resources, the warlords in more habitable climes to the south and west see no point in conquering them. The size of the region, the lack of roads, and the harshness of the winters are enough to deter any sensible despot from attempting such a foolish action. And there is little danger in simply ignoring them - the closest most of the villages have to an army is a few old men armed with even older hunting rifles. It seems that unless the people of Siberia are able to somehow unify themselves or are conquered by a successful claimant to Russia's legacy, they will continue to eke out an existence as they always have: isolated and alone, on the edge of the world."

A dream of a peaceful Russia, free from all strife and suffering, under the caring guidance of one of God's many servants, a son of Men himself.\n\nHowever, God's favor was not enough to protect him, and the land suffered under a usurper, who used of His name for a tragedy beyond understanding.\n\n§xNow, from this cradle of hope, all that lies is poison and death, for God dare not give Russia a false hope again.§!"

 TNO_anarchy_NRL_tt: "§BThe Isolated Settlements of Northern Siberia§!"
 TNO_anarchy_NRL_tt_delayed: "When the Siberian Plan was drafted by the economists of the Soviet Union, there were great plans for the northern parts of central Siberia. Roads would connect the desolate wastelands with the rest of Russia, industries were to be built atop the region's bountiful mineral deposits and cities would be built where once there was nothing. All those lofty plans quickly turned into ash as the thirties went on. Shovels could barely pierce the permafrost and the use of forced labor became commonplace. Instead of being integrated into the industrial cities to the south, a rough patchwork of improvised roads barely connected a few towns and Gulag complexes. Once the Great Patriotic War began, the development plans for the region were largely abandoned except for the rapid exploitation of the mines in the far north by forced labor. When the Great Patriotic War was lost, the region fell into abject disrepair and isolation.\n\nToday, only the decayed metal husks of great projects remind the few people who venture here from the southern portions of Siberia of the great projects of the Siberian Plan. The gulags are deserted, the mines are long since derelict, and the few roads built into the region have largely been consumed by the harsh elements of Siberia itself. What little life exists in this edge of the world now more closely resembles that of centuries ago with isolated hunting and subsistence farming communities scraping by as they have for hundreds of years before industrialization briefly reached this part of the world. And as long as the anarchy persists in the rest of Russia, things are unlikely to change for a hundred more years."
