JAP_the_dlc_investigation:0 "The Dai Li Crisis Investigation"
JAP_the_dlc_investigation_desc:0 "What was suposed to be a simple intelligence operation turned out to be one of the largest conspiracies Japan has ever underwent as a nation. It speaks volumes as to how huge it is that the central government is unable to determine the sheer scale of the conspiracy, let alone who is involved in it or what its aim is. There are five possible leads one can take to solve the investigation, ranging from incursions deep into China, to covert operations in the United States, and lastly, investigations within Japan itself. Which path is chosen would determine your success in investigating the conspiracy: pick the correct path, and your conspiratorial investigation would go quicker than expected. Pick the wrong path, and you will be setting yourself down a dark path for not only Japan, but the whole Co-Prosperity Sphere."

JAP_target_western_desc:0 "After the Ichi-Go campaign of 1944, the fighting capabilities of Chiang Kai-Shek regime collapsed into disorganized and completely desperate resistance. During the march westward less and less Japanese were met with proper divisions, but instead rag-tag militias and ad-hoc created units. With them was the Loyal Patriotic Army, yet another organization led by Dai Li. The LPA took a blunt of fighting in the last year of the war and was thought to be completely eradicated from the face of earth. The arising conspiracy however suggests that just maybe, they were able to survive and still plot against the Empire of Rising Sun."

General overview and reports suggest that while the Chiang regime was generally a failure when it comes to fighting Japanese, their intelligence was able to successfully infiltrate and deal serious damage to Nanjing government. Post-war the purge of administration was conducted, but with Dai Li Conspiracy revealing the suspicion that Juntong still operates in Gao Zongwu government is as strong as ever."

japdlc.1.t:0 "General Sun Dianying Is Arrested"
japdlc.1.d:0 "Sun Dianying was relieved after Jessfield 76 had let him go some days prior. He made a note to himself to stay out of the way of secret police in the future, especially now that he would soon be retiring. Still, he had been released and relieved of the burden of their suspicions, at least in an official capacity. It was not as if further interrogations would yield anything more, they had nothing on him and it would continue that way. As he sat by the window, smoking a cheap cigarette, he wondered if any of his colleagues would also be interrogated. Still, the matter was over for him and thus not worth troubling himself too much with.\n\nIt therefore came as a great surprise to General Dianying, after opening the door to his apartment in the, to be greeted by the sight of three officers of the Kempeitai and a particularly nervous translator. Without as much as a feigned gesture of respect for military rank, he was grabbed and handcuffed by two of the Kempeitai agents, while the third read off a number of charges they had brought against him.\n\nOld General Sun Dianying was hurriedly shoved into the back of a featureless truck, while the chinese translator did his best to relay the news to him. Dianying was sure they had nothing on him, just like with Jessfield 76, he couldn't help but feel like he would be taken in for rather longer this time.\n\nIt didn't take long for the Chinese authorities to notice Dianying's arrest and disappearance into the bowels of the Kempeitai's local department. Most troubling though, was the lack of any explanation for the actions of the Japanese agents, who had simply descended upon the old general's quiet apartment complex, without as much as a phone call to any authority in China. A demand for transparency was in order, and it would be coming straight from the General Staff of the ROC. To see their colleague treated in such a manner was a striking insult and regardless of what overruling authority the Kempeitai might have within the Sphere, they had a dangerous line which could not go ignored."
japdlc.1.a:0 "Why didn't they alert anyone?"

japdlc.2.t:0 "RGOC General Staff Demands Explanation"
japdlc.2.d:0 "Not wishing to waste any more time, while the Kempeitai continued to violate not only a significant number of laws and treaties but also the dignity of the Chinese army, the ROC General Staff gathered in the early morning to force the issue to a swift conclusion.\n\nAs they sat around an office made hazy by a mixture of cigarette smoke after some hours of discussion, it was decided that a telegram would be sent straight to the very top, to the Prime Minister of Japan. The general staff would demand an answer to two questions relating to General Dianying's capture. Firstly, why had the Kempeitai decided to overrule the thorough and sound interrogation conducted by Jessfield 76? Secondly, why had they decided to abduct the general without as much as a word to the proper authorities, most importantly the ROC General Staff itself? The telegram concluded with a request that should any wrongdoing be discovered, that the generals be allowed to deal with it.\n\nThe message was then quickly dispatched after being marked as distinctly urgent. Most of the general staff elected to wait for a response, rather than retire to bed and risk finding that the situation had grown ever more appalling. When a reply from the Prime Minister did not arrive after several hours, the general staff were left with two possibilities as to what was occuring in Tokyo. Either the Japanese were still floundering for an appropriate answer to send back to them, or that the Prime Minister had simply decided to ignore their demands outright."
japdlc.2.a:0 "This is troubling."

japdlc.3.t:0 "China Demands An Explanation"
japdlc.3.d:0 "The telegram sent by the General Staff of the ROC arrived at the Kotei just in time for the Prime Minister's breakfast. After passing through a number of security checks, the telegram itself was delivered alongside the usual selection plates, cups and other crockery. As the Prime Minister read through the message between sips of green tea, a look of frank confusion, followed by severe concern spread across his face.\n\nHe had of course heard of General Dianying's previous arrest and subsqeuent unfruitful interrogation by Jessfield 76, leading him to believe that the man would fade away into retirement. Therefore, this news of his sudden, and most of all mysterious second arrest by the Kempeitai was nothing short of extremely troubling. The matter was now worsened by the fact that the ROC General Staff were demanding answers and actions on the Prime Minister's part, and they had seemingly been aware of the issue before even himself.\n\nBreakfast ended rather quicker than usual, as the Prime Minister rushed off to contact the Home Minister. As he had no explanation as to the matter either, he demanded that it be investigated immediately. In the meantime, he would send off some vague promise of a forthcoming documentation of Dianying's arrest. As the rush-job of a reply was sent back to Nanjing, the Prime Minister was left with the thought that the answer the Chinese General Staff was seeking would be far more complex than anticipated."
japdlc.3.a:0 "If we knew anything, we'd tell you already."

japdlc.4.t:0 "The Home Minister's Initial Report"
japdlc.4.d:0 "With the Prime Minister attempting to keep the ROC General Staff distracted with promises of a soon to be delivered explanation of General Dianying's arrest, it was now up to the Home Minister to formalise a report that would hopefully rectify the increasingly concerning matter.\n\nAfter some dubious reluctance on the part of the Kempeitai stationed in Nanjing, the Home Minister, was finally able to acquire a copy of their report. The initial sections of the documents explained that Diaying had been arrested following the Kempeitai's dissatisfaction with the previous efforts of Jessfield 76. Following paragraphs detailed the pressing urgency of acquiring proper information from the old general, with fears that the wider issues being examined by the Kempeitai might grow out of control. The Home Minister found himself more confused than ever, yet there were still more documents to examine.\n\nDianying, as it turned out, was only a small part of something much larger in scale. While the Japanese secret service had naturally dedicated much of their time to eradicating any traces of potential Chinese resistance from the ROC, they had in recent months began to focus on potential infiltration of the Japanese army. Dianying's arrest was an attempt to find a link between the resistance and any Japanese officers that might have become compromised in some capacity.\n\nWith this revelation now in the hands of the Home Minister, he opted to immediately deliver his report to the Prime Minister in person. As expected, the Prime Minister was deeply concerned with the developments. There was little solace to be had in knowing that the situation in China might be truly disastrous. The Prime Minister could only hope that the Kempeitai prove more forthcoming with their information in the future. As the Home Minister exited his office, he could only stare at the document presented before him, hoping that the characters on the paper might materialise into a solution."
japdlc.4.a:0 "Troubling, to say the least."

japdlc.5.t:0 "From The Valley of the Dead"
japdlc.5.d:0 "The sun was fading. The shadows got longer and longer, until beams shining through the windows created silhouettes in the ground that were outlandishly high, like beasts in a shadow puppet show. [Root.GetLeader] was tapping his foot on the ground anxiously. He had to get the call. For what must have been the fourth time in that hour, he checked the lines. They were not cut or bugged. The lines were secure, but no amount of reassurance would convince him so. The room was too dark. He did not like to see his own shadow. It loomed over him, followed him. It would never leave. He despised it for that. \n\nPulling the cord on the lamp, he read through the papers again, his hands shaking as he pulled them to the light of the lamp. From Nanjing, the Kempeitai. All connected to the end of the war with China. The final moments. He remembered those days, how it all seemed so clear. These papers offered a glimpse at those times, when peace in all the world was certain. And that grim photo, sitting atop the neat stack of papers. The body was unrecognizable, crushed by Chongqing rumble and burned to a cinder. \n\nAll of the evidence was coming together in the most terrifying way. It made [Root.GetLeader] sick to his stomach. \n\nThe telephone rang. [Root.GetLeader] hesitated for a moment. His heart was beating faster than it had ever rung before, faster then when the bombs hit the enterprise or when the Germans blew up Pearl Harbor."
japdlc.5.a:0 "Suddenly, his gut made the choice for him, and his hands shot for the telephone."

japdlc.6.t:0 "A Great Conspiracy"
japdlc.6.d:0 "As Kempeitai reports made their way to Tokyo, it was becoming clear to the Home Minister just how truly bad the Chinese infiltration had become. Older reports had little actual basis in their claims of mass infiltration of the Japanese army. They spoke little of Dai Li either, instead presenting a number of theories as to which chinese rebels were believed to still be alive and capable of directing such a plot against the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Yet as more and more information arrived at the Home Minister's office, mere rumours and dubious theories began to transform into genuine facts.\n\nThe name Dai Li began to appear in more and more reports, and as it did, so did the names of many Japanese Officers. Some were believed to have willingly joined with Dai Li's cause, fully aware of their betrayal. Others were seemingly unaware of their crimes, having been misled by the multitude of agents that the Chinese had spread throughout the Sphere. With each moment, with each paper that was read, with each telegram from the Nanjing Kempeitai, a conspiracy was being unveiled.\n\nAs the Home Minister discovered more and more about the seemingly bottomless conspiracy, the circle of those he dared to share his findings with continued to shrink.He had already begun locking away any document pertaining to Dai Li when he left his office for even a moment. He had dismissed his usual assistants too, preferring to copy each file by himself. Another safe, if tedious measure. For now, he would continue to report to the Prime Minister and only ever in person. If anyone else was to hear of Dai Li, it would be on Kantei's authority."
japdlc.6.a:0 "Oh no."

japdlc.7.t:0 "War Minister's Proposal"
japdlc.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister was not exactly sure what he was expecting and his War Minister also did not seem to know with certainty what exactly he should expect. They sat down in the cabinet and for a few minutes they were completely silent. He could expect anything – outright orders, suggestions of resignation, very forceful demands of explanations or immediate concessions. Instead, the War Minister heavily sighed, as he seemed to be struck as heavily by this news as him.\n\n"I thought I could trust them, you know?" he said. "I really thought so."\n\nThe Prime Minister silently nodded. The general stirred up his tea, not looking the Prime Minister directly into his eyes.\n\n"I just wonder how we got here. I don"t actually think Dai Li is important" he said. "What is important is that the Army is no longer the paragon of virtue. The men in high ranks, working with such war criminals and enemies of an Empire? Madness, pure madness. But it"s all true.\n\nThe leader of Japan's civilian government sighed.\n\n"We shall conduct an investigation immediately to find out the traitors and deliver justice" he promised.\n\n"Yes, I know" the war minister sighed. "You know how this works. Those are my conditions."\n\nHalf an hour later they were already set in place. The investigation was supposed to be swift, decisive, conclude swiftly and in limited scale. The Army demanded "some sort of ability" to influence the investigation, although the details would be discussed later. The War Minister also asked for the Prime Minister to inform him regularly of progress. Although the conditions were downright insulting for the elected Prime Minister of Japan, he felt down in his heart that there is not much choice."
japdlc.7.a:0 "We are in no position to deny"

japdlc.8.t:0 "Picking a Chief Investigator"
japdlc.8.d:0 "Once plans for the investigation were brought out to the military, their reaction was predictable. Many forceful letters and telegrams were sent out to the Prime Minister, before the two sides came to the negotiating table.\n\nAkira Muto was a long standing militarist, and his reputation was notorious among the Japanese government for his connections to conspiracies and coups in the interwar years. Now he entered the Prime Minister"s office, accompanied by half a dozen other Army and Navy officers, to settle the matter of the investigation.\n\n"You do understand that we will be more than willing to supervise the investigations." said Muto bluntly, his finger rapping on the hardwood chair he sat in across from the Prime Minister. \n\n"I do understand" he replied, "but this is a matter of criminal investigation. Many of my associates are suggesting the Home Ministry lead the case. To have military supervisors in an investigation over the Imperial Army in China would likely leave many stones unturned."\n\nGeneral Muto winced, even in his old age he was prone to bouts of anger, but he could not risk humiliating himself in front of the Prime Minister. He insisted once again that leaving the Home Ministry in charge would be nothing but a bureaucratic mess, and only hand more power "to the meddlesome representatives in Tokyo".\n\n"Your Excellency , the Army can acquire the records and suspects faster than it will take the Home Ministry. This is an incident outside of Japan, and it should fall under our administration, not Tokyo's."\n\nIt seems that a choice will need to be made as to who is the full authority on this investigation. More likely than not, someone close is going to be very unhappy."
japdlc.8.a:0 "The Home Ministry would be best"
japdlc.8.a:0 "A military edge is what we need"
japdlc.8.a:0 "Neither would be better than the other"

japdlc.9.t:0 "The Great Conspiracy Unfolds"
japdlc.9.d:0 ""So," the Kempeitai officer said to Masahiro, "what did you see in the forests, Lieutenant Masahiro? The HQ would be incredibly interested in the details of such." They sat in gray concrete room, with a single electric bulb alighting their conversation. Masahiro could not hear what was going on outside. The Kempeitai had requested that he come to their office for questioning. That was the scare of his day, words that chilled his soul. Now that he was in the station, he was in the hands of the military police.\n\n"Well," Masahiro began, "the villagers have sighted a figure walking through the bamboo forests, wearing a cloak made out of the long leaves." He rustled his hands against one another. "They say that it is a spirit of vengeance. You know, like a Chinese version of Youkai. I did not believe them, either. I don't take many walks out there in the woods - but the reports kept coming in. Soon, my office was full of villagers outright gossiping that a spirit of vengeance is coming for us all."\n\nThe Kempeitai officer looked at Masahiro, noting everything that he said. "Do you believe it, Masahiro-san? Personally?"\n\n"No, I don't. As I said, I don't take many walks out there in the woods. However, when I do, there is a certain chill that runs through me." He looked down at his fingers. "Like someone was watching me."\n\n"Hmm." The Kempeitai officer coughed. "That will be all. Thank you, Lieutenant Masahiro."\n\n"Just one question." The officer looked at him intently."
japdlc.9.a:0 "How will you go about ghost-busting?"

japdlc.100.t:0 "Chongqing: Where Everything Started"
japdlc.100.d:0 "The Battle of Chongqing ended in 1947, and as the last battle of the Second World War, both sides were equally devastated. Due to starvation and general dissent, most of the proper army of Chiang Kai-Shek collapsed into disorganized militias. One of those militias was the infamous Loyal Patriotic Army led by Dai Li. Despite massive shortages, Dai Li's leadership and fanaticism inspired his men to ferociously resist the Japanese.\n\nIn the ruins of Chongqing, the supposedly dead body of Dai Li was found, and with LPA units limiting their activity, it was thought that total victory was finally won. Now that we know that Dai Li cheated death, we cannot be certain anymore. There are two major questions. Did LPA survive the aftermath of the Chongqing battle, and if yes, are they still related to the great conspiracy set by Dai Li?"
japdlc.100.a:0 "Let's examine aftermath of Battle of Chongqing."

japdlc.101.t:0 "Remains of Loyal Patriotic Army"
japdlc.101.d:0 "Takeichi Takamura's office swelters in the humid Sichuan weather, punctuated with the distinct smell of Chunghwas and a smattering of both Japanese and Chinese among his clerks. Chengdu was nearing the far ends of Tokyo's grasp over China, and while it may not be an active warzone like Mengjiang was, it was a pretty dead-end posting for a career bureaucrat.\n\nThat is, until the reports by panicking locals started flooding.\n\nIt started with an upsurge of watchman weapon requisitions. Sure, a few surplus rifles and sidearms - who cares what goes missing in the labyrinth of Japanese-controlled China anyway. Then, bit by bit, the weapons started to disappear. And then, the declarations and warnings started.\n\nTakamura was called to investigate an attack on a depot far to the north. Reading through the details of the attack, he felt his blood freeze.\n\n"This is for Chongqing"\n\nThere aren't that many organised resistance forces in the region that's capable of such an attack, and the telltale signs were all there. Surely this can't be it, uttered Takamura - we got rid of the LPA ages ago!\n\n"Call Sato for a private meeting - I think we may be onto something huge here""
japdlc.101.a:0 "Irrelevant. Focus on Juntong core."
japdlc.101.b:0 "Launch investigation into Dai Li's militia force."

japdlc.102.t:0 "The Investigation Begins"
japdlc.102.d:0 "The Sichuan humidity was tempered by a cooling morning shower, as raindrops tap on the window in Takeichi Takamura's office. What was usually a cool respite for the liaisons officer turned into an immense distraction to his work on the investigation. Opposite him was Masaharu Sato, jovially whistling the melody of a Shanghai bar-room singer playing on the turntable.\n\n"Cut it out, Sato - I'm working here."\n\n"Well, where the hell are you even gonna start at? There's twenty new groups calling themselves resistance fighters every month, only to reveal themselves as extortion gangs in their second week."\n\n"It's not what you - forget it, just turn down the turntable a little, and pass me that folder."\n\n"Noteworthy Groups and Organisations. Interesting little folder for a backwater like this."\n\nThe folder was indeed, as Sato had mentioned previously, filled with irrelevant and trifling groups. Hell, there were even 6 groups claiming to be directly loyal to Chiang Kai-Shek himself - ignoring how he's dead, and decidedly so for more than twenty years now. Takamura lights a cigarette and sighs in frustration, until Sato breaks the silence:\n\n"Hey, how come that new monastic order from Hui isn't in this file?"\n\n"Why on earth would you raise suspicion on a monastic order?"\n\n"Because Tsuji shoots damn near everyone who tries to leave. Either they're ridiculously lucky, or they're not from Hui in the first place.""
japdlc.102.a:0 "Like sand in a sea of sand."

japdlc.103.t:0 "The Order Of The Auspicious Jade"
japdlc.103.d:0 ""Why the hell didn't I guess that earlier."\n\n"I told you before Takamura, no real resistance fighter group would actually come out and call themselves resistance fighters."\n\nThe Order of the Auspicious Jade was an ordinary monastic organisation on the surface. Adherents of Mongolian Buddhism, they claim to be refugees from Hui State - an organisation dedicated to forming mutual aid networks through their circle of temples, to alleviate the misery and savagery brought upon by Tsuji's administration. Noble on the surface, it seems, with little reasons to suspect. At least, until one realises that it's nigh impossible to evade Tsuji's cavalry patrols, roaming around the borders of Hui to ensure nobody escapes.\n\n"So, what now?"\n\n"Well, we could just wait for them to reveal themselves - heard from one certain Zhang Liren that they don't even speak Mandarin in the Northwestern dialect, one of their leaders even sounds like he's from Yunnan."\n\nTakamura knows they don't have much time - but who can he rely on for a quick and decisive raid? The police? Poorly equipped rabble, and bathing in a cloud of opium half the time. The Kempeitai? Who's to say that they're not allied? The only reasonable option left is the army - and he could count on a favour from a gambling-addled colonel.\n\n"Give me the address of the Order's headquarters. I'll ring Colonel Tameichi, once he lets his hand go off the bottle.""
japdlc.103.a:0 "Let's snoop them out."

japdlc.104.t:0 "Round-up in Chengde Successful"
japdlc.104.d:0 "Masaharu Sato stands underneath a street lamp in a seemingly empty road. Taking out a match, he lights one up - and wipes it on his boot. He repeats the weird gesture again, twice for posterity. Upon the third match, eight plainclothes armed with Arisaka rifles and Nambus emerge from an alley.\n\n"Almost thought you forgot the signal. Where's Takamura?"\n\n"Bureaucracy."\n\nThe nine men walk up to the monastery's compound carefully - stopping behind a corner to avoid a sentry. The sentry made a fateful turn towards the patrol, as Sato locked him in a chokehold with a knife to his throat.\n\n"I know who you are, and I know what you do. If you cooperate, I'll let you live. So answer this question good - is the Order a Juntong unit?"\n\nThe sentry nods, swallowing a glob nervously.\n\n"Good man. Two of you - keep him tied here."\n\nThe attacking detachment split themselves into two units - one from the main entrance, and the rest from a side gate left unlocked by the sentry. The ensuing firefight was a one-sided slaughter, with only one Japanese operative dead. As Sato approached the corpse of the Order's leader, he stumbled upon several dossiers left in an unlocked safe.\n\n"OPERATION 'AUSPICIOUS JADE' - CHENGDU INFILTRATION CONTINGENCY"\n\nAt the foot of the folder lies the personal seal of Dai Li, as well as the Juntong's seal of approval. Sato lets out a grin - his mission is accomplished."
japdlc.104.a:0 "All in a day's work."

japdlc.105.t:0 "The Chinese are Interfering"
japdlc.105.d:0 "Takamura is by his lonesome again, in the scorching Sichuan heat. The fluctuating weather and the unpleasantness of its extremes only add to his ever-expanding stress. Lately, he's noticed his nicotine consumption has been on an uptick - two packs a day. The days are longer and the nights are shorter - but it doesn't really make much difference given how he barely leaves the office.\n\n"NATIONAL SECURITY BUREAU - CHENGDU SPECIAL DETACHMENT"\n\nOn the surface, the folder looks fine. Chinese intelligence has been cooperating reasonably - granting extra manpower and weaponry when called upon and deemed appropriate. At least, until Takamura got to the "Evidence Collected" segment, ostensibly to check whether Japanese and Chinese records match when it came to evidence.\n\n"Chengdu Dossier - Disregard, send to Nanjing for confirmation."\n\nTakamura wondered to himself why would the Chinese send such crucial evidence to Nanjing first, without Japanese approval? Sato has already sent in his report to Tokyo - as per procedure, but the Chinese side of the investigation has seemingly missed out a crucial administrative procedure.\n\nCould it be sabotage? It couldn't be, China has everything to lose if they break away from the Sphere now. Gao's reforms are still weak. On the other hand, Takamura has little to lose. There aren't many political consequences for expelling the Chinese - hell, Tokyo may even prefer that to risking any state secrets. On the other hand, playing their game may lead Takamura's investigation to levels previously unheard of. All in all, one question rings in Takamura's head:\n\n"Is this risk worth it?""
japdlc.105.a:0 "A lonesome Japanese effort."
japdlc.105.b:0 "Play their game - let's see where that leads us."

japdlc.106.t:0 "Back To Square One"
japdlc.106.d:0 ""Great fucking job, Takamura. You've expelled the Chinese - now what? Going solo, huh? Need I remind you that you've just been here for a month? What do you know about working in Sichuan."\n\nTakamura rubs his fingers against his temple and pours another glass of rice wine for himself. In the far reaches of Sichuan, Takamura has adjusted comparatively well to the vastly different living conditions compared to his cushy job in Ginza previously. Though, the adjustment in living conditions wasn't met with an appropriate adjustment to his new job - especially compared to his nominal subordinate."I had little choice, Sato! Either way, we're back at square one - what now?"\n\n"I'll tell you what now - know the enemy inside and out. Study their fucking command structures, look for fucking clues. I'm out for lunch right now - I'll be back in an hour."\n\nTakamura's answer was replied with a door in his face. It's unfortunate, but Takamura knows that this is the only way now, now that the Chinese leads are gone. He picked up a file on the bookshelf.\n\n"INTELLIGENCE REPORT - JUNTONG INFILTRATION CAPABILITIES"\n\nTakamura notes how the Juntong was successfully able to infiltrate civilian organisations with ease, through a combination of both coercion and charm, sometimes either, sometimes both. Most commonly, Juntong detachments that were caught mostly disguised themselves as traders, or Nanjing-aligned militias. In the far reaches of the Chinese countryside, it's hard to tell who's who, who's an enemy, and who's an ally - and sometimes, one can never get a proper answer."
japdlc.106.a:0 "Hopefully, two steps forward the next round."

japdlc.107.t:0 "Luring Them Out"
japdlc.107.d:0 ""You sure about this, Sato?"\n\n"I've served here for almost a decade now, Takamura. I know how to wring secrets out like fish guts. Just act natural, and follow my lead. Remember - it's dinner and drinks, not swords and swashbuckling."\n\nThe two officers finally met their Chinese counterparts. Dressed in ordinary, unassuming suits, the men lit up cigarettes and made pleasantries. Sato in particular surprised Takamura, especially with his near-fluency of Sichuanese. Takamura himself restrained from much comment beyond basic greetings in Mandarin. Ending their pleasantries, the four men entered the restaurant with a lit neon sign saying "Bai Shi Lao Restaurant" and ordered a multi-course meal.\n\n"So gentlemen, how's the weather up north lately?"\n\n"Nothing too harsh - just a few scattered sandstorms here and there. Last week there was a particularly bad sandstorm though - at Nanchang."\n\n"I see, I see."\n\nThe men wrapped up their main courses and moved on to desserts. No alcohol yet, Sato was holding off until they're fully comfortable. Takamura would have never been able to do this by his lonesome - in Japan, perhaps, but not in Sichuan.\n\n"Well, the night is still young, gentlemen - would you like to join me and my colleague here for some rounds of baijiu?"\n\n"Sato-san, we'd love to - but we've got a train to catch tomorrow, headed for Guangzhou.""
japdlc.107.a:0 "Well, I insist - it's on me."

japdlc.108.t:0 "Mere Fools, Mere Pawns"
japdlc.108.d:0 ""What a bender eh, Takamura. I thought you'd be a lot more of a man with all that rice wine at your desk all the time."\n\n"Not all at once, Sato." said Takamura groggily. "Did they say anything though, on the cab home?"\n\n"Not a word - held their liquor pretty damn well."\n\nTakamura let his head drop backwards in frustration. What now? The soft route couldn't take care of them. The hard route? They're off to Guangzhou now, and dealing with the Guangzhou detachment is another whole can of worms Takamura would rather avoid dealing with entirely. It's almost as if Takamura lost his lead entirely.\n\n"What now Sato? I'm going to fucking lose it, if we don't get any leads."\n\nSato laid out to Takamura that there are still plenty of avenues for the investigation to move forward, but Takamura points out it can only be done on one condition - expel the Chinese agents from the investigation.\n\n"Why would you do that? We're losing leads here!"\n\n"Better to get rid of them than to risk anything, Sato. That's an order."\n\n"

"Did they say anything though, on the cab home?"\n\n"Well, I'd suggest you sober up a little - you'll want to hear every detail of this."Takamura stood up, holding onto the sofa every inch of the way towards the door. Outside, he washed his face before lighting a cigarette. Glancing at the bright Sichuan sun peeking over the hills, a slight grin formed on his face. Maybe he'd get used to this, a life in the tropics. The liaison office is small, but it fits, almost dreaming of an idyllic existence - only to be interrupted by Sato's call.\n\n"Hey, Lieutenant, I'm not sure if Tokyo is paying you to smoke cigarettes and drink yourself to death, but we still have an investigation ongoing."\n\nTakamura headed back inside groggily, picking up a cup of coffee on his way to his desk.\n\n"So - those two fucks? Spilled everything we wanted to hear. I didn't even need to prod them all that much, I just brought up the missing evidence. They thought I was with the fucking NSB, so they spoke a little about Kempeitai operations in Nanjing before they blacked out.\n\nAt last, a breakthrough."

It seems as though he has finally tracked down the ever-elusive Loyal Patriotic Army - or at least, whatever's left of it. Though this was a shot in the dark, it was the only shot the department had at the moment, and time is ticking away before they can yet again bleed into the countryside.\n\n"Maybe we can finally get this Dai Li shit moving"\n\n"Maybe so, Sato-san, maybe so".\n\nTakamura and Sato quickly realised that their overstretched police squadrons probably wouldn't be up to task for a job like this and unfortunately, there's only one more authority in the region they could trust to expand this mission with - the army. The pent-up paranoia from interservice rivalry, partisan and "partisan" attacks understandably have made Takamura incredibly reluctant to cooperate with the army, let alone on such a high-risk mission like this.\n\nUnfortunately, only the army has the resources for such an excursion to both conduct the sweep and gather sensitive intelligence from the countryside.\n\n"Ring that old dog Fujimura right now - tell him Takamura wants a meeting in confidence as soon as he lets go of that bottle"\n\n"Oh and, don't bring the Kempeitai into this. Not yet, at least"\n\nTakamura knows he has to act - and he has to act fast. Now, his entire premise hinges on whether the Army is willing to cooperate in his sweep."

What greeted him made his heart sink.\n\n"Hey, Takamura - you may want to see this."\n\nFearing the worst, Takamura snatches the folder from Sato's hands.

japdlc.202.d:0 "The crash sites would be examined first, upon the investigators suggestion. After all, the American documents were at least being preserved in a drawer somewhere. Their journey from the airport at Nanjing to the mountains of southwestern China had presented them with a multitude of memorable vistas as they traveled by rail, road and finally, footpath to reach their destination. It was nothing short of deeply refreshing to leave their Tokyo office for more than a day or two.\n\nThe sites themselves consisted of wrecks of about four downed American aircraft, lost during their attempted evacuation in 1944. In the ensuing twenty years since the initial investigation had closed with little to report other than the obvious, nature had distinctly managed to reclaim much of the wreckage. Nature had also begun to creep back in to one or two sites, with a wing or two sticking out of a field of crops. The site was steadily becoming steadily more disappointing, as the investigators looked on.\n\nWith the aid of the report from the previous team that had worked on the crashes, the investigators were able to confirm one thing, the previous report was absolutely correct. The planes were some of the last that had attempted to leave China, and had been caught by anti-air guns positioned to stop them. Apart from some battered ration kits, a dog tag and some other personal effigies, the search was fruitless. Worst of all was the lack of anything that led back to Dai Li, or even a hint that perhaps some Americans were still out there.\n\nThey would need to widen their search, perhaps into Tibet. Had anyone managed to escape the crash, or otherwise survive the evacuation, then they would have quickly tried to move on. The investigators could take solace in one thing alone at this point, at least the scenery would continue to be interesting."

There, they had hoped to find some evidence of the route taken by SACO, after leaving China. Yet the trail was quickly found to be colder than the mountains the investigators trekked through. Locals confirmed that American soldiers had indeed traveled through their communities, but they had never stayed for long and never left a trace of their presence.\n\nThe Chinese side of the investigation proved to be equally disappointing. Despite searching the area in what could only be described as a thorough manner, the team found little more than a few scraps of metal from the crashed planes. They had sunk to the bottom of a nearby river and upon their extraction, the scraps unearthed some shards of ancient chinese pottery. These were jokingly regarded as the real finds of the entire expedition, although the investigators were never allowed in on the joke.\n\nAfter several weeks of searching, only one more object of interest was found. A single plane. It had gone down over the Himalayas, and by examining what little that remained of it, the investigators were able to only achieve one thing. It told them the same, now redundant facts, that they had known since they first read the initial report from twenty years ago."

At the very least, the investigators were able to confirm the findings of the initial investigation in the 1940s were most certainly accurate. Yet this ultimately did little to dampen the impact of their failure. They would be forced to remain in Tokyo for a good while now, whilst the government turned towards its other assets for aid.\n\nIn the United States, the Japanese government employed a number of spies to provide them with insight as to the workings of the United States government. Since the Dai Li conspiracy had first been uncovered, these figures had been waiting to find out exactly what the Americans might know about the situation. Their time was now soon to come, with Tokyo desperate for answers. Besides, guarded state secrets must surely contain some useful information."

Each entrance would be checked for alarms, guard patrols would be memorised and any potential job opportunity that might get one inside the building would be quickly taken. \n\nMore and more information was gathered regarding the archives. Photographs were taken of the exterior and surrounding area, at every hour of the day. Eventually, blueprints of the building were discovered, providing the spies with a new level of insight. A plan was beginning to take shape. The next step would involve getting inside the archive for long enough to expand upon their limited insider knowledge. The fastest possible route from one entrance to the SACO files would be plotted and if possible, tested before the actual break-in would take place. These next few steps would be delicately executed, even with pressure from the government back in Japan.\n\nSome back in Tokyo had demanded a quicker operation, yet this course of action was ruled out. It was better to not start a diplomatic incident with the United States, while at the same time dealing with a possible conspiracy within the ranks of the army."

The janitor on duty had been careless enough to leave the back entrance way unlocked after finishing up for the night. Five minutes later, the power went out, and the security guard called for an electrician to resolve the issue. For the brief fifteen minutes, the building was completely dark and security a little laxer as the security guard himself escorted the electrician to the fusebox. Yet that was all it took. At that time, a man in a black coat entered the building and removed exactly one document from the Chinese section of the archives, before leaving and driving off in a rather anonymous van. He would later meet with the janitor and the electrician to celebrate their successful operation.\n\nThe cargo of that van was then handed off to another agent, waiting at a nearby airfield. After a number of plane and car journeys from the east coast to the west, and a brief stop in San Francisco, he boarded a boat headed to Hawaii. Waiting there was Gen. Fujiwara himself, who had been anxious to see the documents delivered. Now, they were in his hands, safe on his personal plane en route to Tokyo.\n\nIt was there that the files were finally opened. Behind closed doors Fujiwara and the Prime Minister, alongside other trusted officials gathered to hear just what the Americans knew. It was a simple enough thing, a mere list of the fates of the SACO members, listed alphabetically, beginning with those killed. One name of interest cropped up, General Joseph Stilwell, confirmed to have been KIA.The assembled politicians continued to scan the list, with a growing sense of angst and urgency. Just as it seemed they were about to hit another dead end consisting of nothing but RETURNED, more and more Americans were listed as MIA, possibly having been forced to stay behind. Yet one name made the officials pause in their tracks, the name of a rumoured friend of Dai Li.\n\nMILES, MILTON E. (ADMIRAL)- MIA: LAST SEEN 3 DAYS PRIOR TO FULL SACO EVACUATION."

A degree of normalcy then returned to the room, before the Prime Minister dismissed his array of advisors. Just prior to exiting himself, the Home Minister announced that he would be contacting Kempeitai departments across the Sphere, in the hopes that they might now finally be able to narrow down the search.\n\nWith the investigators now out in the field again, they were able to make some headway regarding the missing Admiral. A courier sent out of Shanghai was found to be carrying a package discreetly marked with the emblem of the Juntong, the intelligence service belonging to Dai Li. Interrogating the courier relieved that he had been paid a hefty sum to take the package from Shanghai to Hangzhou, where he would be again paid upon delivering the parcel to a location just outside the city. The man in question was certainly not the Admiral based upon the Courier's description, yet it was a solid lead nonetheless.\n\nBefore proceeding any further with their mission, the agents delivered their report to the Home Minister, detailing the investigator's new hypothesis regarding the Admiral's current actions and whereabouts. While they were yet to confirm his exact location, the most obvious spot was now Shanghai. A large, coastal city, with a great deal of foreigners made for a good hideout for an American not looking for attention.

They would slowly sink their claws into the city, sealing off each and every escape route with every passing day. If nothing else, the Admiral would be quite unable to leave without being seen. An invisible siege had just begun. \n\nWhile the investigating agents continued to widen their net over Shanghai, they turned their focus towards what identity Milton E. Miles might have assumed to blend into his new surroundings. As an American, the Admiral would already be limited in his options. He would need to remain in districts home to many foreigners, with the financial district coming to the minds of the investigators first. Miles was likely posing as a merchant, someone recognisable to his allies, but subtle enough to avoid suspicion.\n\nThen there was the issue of whether the Admiral was still in communication with the United States. There were undoubtedly other Americans working covertly in Shanghai, most of which would be working for the CIA in some direct or indirect capacity. Yet it was still too early to determine whether Miles would be among this group of his countrymen. He was a major threat to Japan first and foremost, regardless of who he counted among his allies.\n\nWith that, another round of theorising was completed by the investigators as they sat around a dingy bar on the outskirts of Shanghai proper. It was now time to enter the Admiral's hiding grounds, and root him out by whatever means necessary."

Yet, here he was in Shanghai, an Australian merchant who had sold rare herbs from the Chinese countryside to rich westerners for over twenty years. Much had been achieved, both above and under the table.\n\nBut, he would never be able to return home at this point, no matter how hard he tried. He was simply too sick, and at his point, unhooking him from the machines in the hospital would be to let the cancer take over.Could have done more towards his ultimate goals, could he have been a better ally to his friend? He thought it a shame that he might not live long enough to witness the fall of the Sphere. At least he would have hastened its demise, perhaps more than he had anticipated.\n\nThe former trader turned his weary head towards the window. The sun was beginning to set, casting a bright orange glow over Shanghai.The trader seemed to breathe easier, and eventually the gentle hum of the fan above him lulled him into a sleep from which he did not wake.\n\nAlthough somewhat well known, the trader had remained somewhat of a mystery to his peers. He had not written a will, and seemingly no friends or family to mourn him. However, there was a small note that he had scribbled one request upon for those who would be tasked with burying him. It was a simple enough thing to ask; to be buried in his old uniform. It had been kept in a box near to his deathbed, folded with great care and respect. As it was taken out of its container, the nurse couldn't help but notice the golden name plate fastened upon the breast pocket: Admiral Milton E. Miles."

Many Shanghainese had indeed heard of a western trader, either from Australia or possibly the United States. He had in fact arrived some decades ago, and quickly blended in among the traditional-style shops and stalls of the district outskirts. \n\nHe had seemingly disappeared only a few years ago, having closed up his shop and said his last goodbyes to his business associates. At the very least, they were able to locate the supposed trader's shop. The new owners had met their predecessor only very briefly. Some weeks later he had been buried up on a hill outside the city.\n\nIt was a simple, almost unmarked grave, hidden among many others of its kind. A simple, if elegantly crafted cross marked the spot. The name upon it was false, that of some persona that Admiral Milton E. Miles had created for himself. He had apparently died in December of 1961, something that concerned the investigators greatly. The next step was crude enough, but necessary. The dead man was dug up and found to be wearing Admiral Miles' uniform. Hospital records confirmed that he had indeed been dying of cancer, and doctors were just about able to recognise his photograph, even without the beard he had grown during his time in Shanghai.\n\nThey had finally reached the trail's end. The last few interrogations yielded little more than to lead them back to that same grave, where the trail would go icy cold over and over again. The dead man could only be Admiral Miles. There was nothing to suggest he had faked his own death and nothing to suggest that the SACO files had been deliberately made inaccurate. The trail had ended. Fujiwara was left puzzled by the revelation. It provided a sense of finality, yet raised new concerns. Most of all, it cast a shadow of doubt over the entire conspiracy now that one of its key figures had in fact been dead for some time now. Progress had been made, but now was certainly not the time to rest easy."

The most powerful men in Japan wanted answers now, and so the vetted agents went to work.\n\nDay and night investigators pored through every footnote they had on his organization. During 1944, there were at least 100,000 other Juntong agents throughout China, and probably twice as many military or political men who could have followed the man out of Chongqing. A network of that many people would need to be whittled down if any evidence was to lead to more than a hunt for a senile ex-spy. Decrypted lists from the war detailed hundreds of NRA cells and caches. Fortunately for the archivists, there was plenty of records from the IJA of which holdouts had been found and eliminated. \n\nAfter days of searching, it became clear that Dai Li had plenty of ways to get out of Chongqing, and with other anti-Japanese leaders declared missing."

Villages where high-level Jutong agents lived, suspected locations in rural China, even the great cities of the coast were probable areas for Dai Li to remain unseen. But their superior had come in with excellent news.\n\n"It's impossible that the Americans would still be supplying Dai Li" a chief investigator bristled to his staff; "there is no way that there could be any amount of supplies transferred without our knowledge to fuel any sort of unrest. No, Dai Li is gathering strength without the Americans, but he still has other conspirators in his ranks."\n\nThe other investigators listened intently as their lieutenant briefed them on new revelations. A separate task force had found connections to Admiral Miles, a U.S naval officer and well-known friend of Dai Li in Shanghai.

The investigators were clear though, that even the slightest mention of their existence to the Japanese public would be met with the utmost repercussions on their entire careers at best. \n\nAround a conference table in one of many buildings the investigators occupied, the dozen or so men and women who made up Japan's greatest psychologists could only come to a few conclusions. Some said Dai Li was simply driven insane by the war, others suspected he could be planning an attempt to sabotage the Army, or even an overthrow of the Chinese government. Other psychologists suggested countless other motives, though these were reasons for a thug to rob a home, not the driving force for a national conspiracy. \n\nAfter some more hours of debate, the conclusive statement is that of a currently unknown motive. As insane or vengeful as any fanatical holdout may be, China is not susceptible to any sort of uprising to turn them against the Japanese Empire. The investigators sigh in frustration.

The old temples and forts were shattered, and the lush parks and gardens had been burnt to cinders. It did not feel like an act of man, but the wrath of a higher power.\n\nLieutenant-General Dai Li turned to his two comrades before breaking the silence they had kept since they arrived.To his right stood Li Kenong. A longtime opponent since the generalissimo began to purge the Communists from his clique, now one of the only men he could trust. Aside from them was American, Admiral Miles, silently mouthing a prayer at the sight of unimaginable devastation.\n\nDai Li thought back to the millennia old tales of the Three Kingdoms, of three noble and cunning leaders meeting to become blood brothers. Yet great princes with honor would have had no answer for a foe which could bring death on land, air, and sea. Their peach garden was reduced to ash.\n\nAnd as Chongqing burned, the three men made an oath that this would not be the end. Japan would answer for what they did in Chongqing and dozens of other cities.\n\n"We will fight" Dai Li said, "We will never give up this burden, until Japan burns like this garden."

On the end of the line, his coworker in a Tokyo office attempted to calm him down, but he refused. "Tell me why the hell one of our three biggest suspects has turned out to be dead. The Army finally realized Dai Li isn't dead, and now we find out Miles is. Doesn't this seem a-"\n\nThe phone hung up. Cursing, the investigator went back down the streets to the graveyard. The Shanghai cops might not have cared when he was alive, but they were doing a better job keeping people away once they had actual superiors. But how on Earth is a supposedly dead man alive, and a supposedly alive man dead?"

japdlc.307.t:0 "Proof and Its Consequences"
japdlc.307.desc:0 ""Prime Minister, the Dai Li situation has taken a severe turn and I believe it is best I meet with you to discuss the matter at once." The Home Minister put down the receiver and prepared to deliver the news to the Prime Minister. He had been expecting an awful conspiracy to be uncovered, that the military was utterly compromised and posed to strike at the government. Yet now that he knew the truth, that he had been leading his entire ministry on a ghost hunt, he felt even more disturbed. There was no time to dwell on the matter, not when the Prime Minister needed to be informed as well.\n\nThe office of his superior was lit only by the setting sun as the Home Minister entered, casting beams of pinkish light across the floor and right-hand wall. The Home Minister gave his best bow and approached the desk. "Sir, I have finally received the reports from my agents, they bring news of a great....but deeply troubling development that we could not have anticipated." <Prime minister's name> poured over the documents, while his minister could not help but watch the look of concern and spread over his face.\n\nFinally, the Prime Minister raised his head from the mass of papers. "But this suggests.... That Dai Li's return was little more than a byproduct of Kempeitai mismanagement. You cannot mean to tell me that we have been led astray by panic alone?" The Home Minister seemed to struggle with bringing forth the necessary words before finally speaking. "I-..I am afraid so, Sir. Our every investigative path leads us either to a dead end or back to the initial report. The rumour of Dai Li infiltrating the army simply falls apart when one examines the situation more closely. This has been a ploy to keep us distracted." \n\nIt was the Prime Minister's turn to be without the capabilities of speech. He instead turned towards the window with his mouth covered by a hand, watching as the Sun disappeared over the horizon. The room fell into darkness. "I need you to find more proof of this disaster, raid every Kempeitai office if you must. This matter needs to die." As he spoke, the Prime Minister did not turn from the window.\n\nThe Home Minister stood up from his seat, bowed and exited the room. Prime Minister [Root.getleader] could not help but wonder..."

japdlc.308.t:0 "Raid on Kempeitai HQ in Nanjing"
japdlc.308.desc:0 "The Prime Minister's order to raid the Kempeitai had been taken to heart by the Home Minister. Not wanting to waste any more time, lest the Kempeitai discovered that they were compromised, he had contacted the Navy. Nanjing was the heart of the military police's power. Except for around the ports, they could be found patrolling the streets in equal frequency to the IJA. To crack open their Headquarters, the navy would have to provide the manpower.\n\nBelow decks on an IJN warship, a unit of the Special Naval Landing Force prepared to storm the streets leading up the Kempeitai Compound.Surprise was their biggest advantage, as there was no reason to believe the military police had any idea of their presence or impending strike. Their orders were simple, open a path to the heart of the compound and seize any documents housed within. Resistance was to be met with force.\n\nThree boats departed from the warship under the cover darkness, each one filled to capacity with the marines of the SNLF. Upon entering the city port, the marines climbed up onto the docks and headed deeper into Nanjing. The unit then split in two and readied themselves to pincer the compound.\n\nThe lone guard at the back gate of Kempeitai HQ was quietly dispatched. A rifle stock which emerged from the shadows connected with his face, knocking him to the ground . A similar scene took place at the side door, where the guard was startled by the marines, before he too was knocked unconscious. With everyone in position, the raid began. Doors at both the back and side of the building were kicked open as dozens of SNLF troops swarmed in. Within thirty seconds, most of the ground floor had been taken without as much as a shot having been fired. Only the military police near the armory and barracks put up much of a fight, although overwhelming gunfire from all sides eventually dislodged them. The building was filled with the sounds of marines rushing towards the upper floors. The race was now on to find the Kempeitai's archive before any of them had the bright idea to burn it all to the ground."

japdlc.309.desc:0 "From the open windows of the abandoned farmhouse that Dai Li called a field base, came a terrible hacking cough. This was followed by the crashing of glass and the toppling of furniture. To the Juntong soldiers who called Dai Li a commander, this was all part of the nightly routine. At the end of the day, he would seclude himself in his farmhouse, drink until he could no longer stand and then fall into a stupor. His men cared not, they in fact appreciated the calm after the drunken storm. Silence meant that they could rest and avoid Dai Li's cruel gaze. Even so, the coughing was particularly vile that night. When it was suggested that someone should check on him, the idea was immediately shot down. Disturbing his "sleep" was deeply unwise and it usually ended in someone being beaten to the ground. The Juntong would simply have to sleep through the tortuous noise.\n\nThe morning usually began with Dai Li viciously waking everyone by whatever means he felt necessary. Yet this morning, Dai Li was nowhere to be found. The decision was made to now finally check on him. Inside the farmhouse, the juntong found the corpse of their commander. The open eyes and mouth, pallid skin and bloody phlegm on his shirt was enough to confirm it then and there. For about a minute, no one dared to even move. Not one among them had considered what to do once the bastard actually died. Some had even thought he was going to outlive them all. The silence was then broken by a suggestion everyone found agreeable.\n\n"We take the body to the woods, bury it and leave."\n\nThe body was carried to a clearing deep in the woods and buried quickly. No one stayed at the spot for long. Once they had all returned to the farmhouse, the former juntong exchanged looks and departed. Some wished to return home, most simply wanted a home to return to."

japdlc.310.desc:0 ""Hold your fire!"\n\nAs the haze cleared from the entranceway to the Kempeitai archives, the bodies of three military police lay scattered on the ground. Where most had simply laid down their guns or tried to run, it seemed that these men were willing to die for what they were guarding. The commander of the SNLF unit trudged through the blood-strewn and bullet-ridden corridor, he quickly noticed that the door to the archive locked.\n\n"Someone go get me a key off one the bodies, now"\n\nA moment later, a key was placed in the commander's hand. He wasted no time in unlocking the door. Fearing that he might still have arrived too late, the sight of untouched shelves and cabinets was a relief.\n\nSearch this place, get going."\n\nAs the marines headed into the archive to begin their search, the commander's attention was quickly drawn to a small unmarked box that had been placed on a desk. Inside was a single unmarked file.\n\n"According to every verifiable source at our disposal, it would appear that Dai Li has been dead since the late 1950s. The exact cause of his death is not entirely understood, but it can be concluded that alcoholism and general poor health were the contributing factors. Despite the descriptions of events given by some of Dai Li's closet followers, a burial location has not been located either. We are also now aware that Dai Li's followers did not attempt to continue operations following his death. We can therefore assume that the Juntong is no longer a threat to the Empire in any capacity."\n\nAs soon as he was done reading, he turned to his second in command who was waiting by the door. n\n"Get this file to Tokyo without delay.\n\n''What does it say, sir?\n\nDon't ask, you'll find out soon enough.""

All of a sudden, a special broadcast interrupted the scheduled programming on both television and radio across Japan. For those watching, the Imperial Seal appeared on the screen, which was quickly followed by a blaring rendition of the national anthem, which also played on the radio transmission. After a few moments, both the seal and the anthem faded away, into a recording from the office of the Home Minister.\n\n"Citizens of the Japanese Empire, a great conspiracy has been uncovered on this day. The Kempeitai, empowered to enforce peace and stability across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, have been uncovered as traitors and turncoats. For several months, they engaged in a scheme to sow chaos and disorder throughout Asia, in hopes of toppling the Emperor's government. Rumours of long-dead chinese rebels and terrorists were spread to deliberately mislead and demoralize the government and armed forces of the Empire. However, due to the swift investigation of these falsehoods, they were dispelled and traced to their source. The Kempeitai have been pacified, their compounds and offices stormed by the loyal troops of the Empire. Their plot, and their very organisation is no more. These traitors will be treated as what they are, enemies of state and to kokutai. Let the fates that await be a reminder of the strength and security of the Empire.\n\nAs the Home Minister finished his message, the national anthem was played again and the Imperial Seal was again displayed. Regular broadcasting resumed just as suddenly as it had been interrupted."

The parties, bizarre relationships - none of that was to be ignored anymore. Post 1947 Republic of China administration was purged out of agents, or at least it was believed so. Now with the unholy revelations being unleashed, those events that should ring the alarm, now would. \n\nOf course, the Republic of China and its administration is loyal to us. But lone wolves can work in its structure nonetheless. It is therefore very important to immediately conduct full-scale investigation into both civilian administration of Nanjing government and intelligence service of Jessfield 76, whose chief Ding Mocun, while loyal - proved to be rather incompetent. \n\nUnfortunately, while this objective has to be done, we have to rely on Chinese cooperation with us and that they will not slow down the investigation.

To the right, the heart of Japan's investigative committee, on a mission to find a once dead terrorist now influencing all of China to revolt. The Japanese investigators were hesitant of their Chinese comrade's findings, but remained eager to see the final results of the audit.\n\nThe head of the joint Sino-Japanese group entered, holding a pile of papers; the summation of their work in tracking down the Juntong. He distributed copies across the table, and the room was silent, but for the flipping of paper and breathing.\n\nAuditing revealed that the Juntong, Dai Li's powerful intelligence agency, is likely not in a direct command structure. Rather, it appears that the Juntong has become decentralized; as small cells dot all of China with little cross communication. A single hunt might bring in just half a dozen agents with no direct superiors. It seems that we will need to find out how exactly these cells coordinate their findings if the Himmler of China is to be caught and defeated. Any intercepted message must be analyzed thoroughly from now on."

The Japanese officials had begun cooperation with intelligence in Nanjing to track down the still living Dai Li, and his plan to turn China against the Japanese Empire. What would be revealed could stop Japan from the threat of a war as brutal as that which brought Japan to the forefront of the world, or aid Dai Li in throwing the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere in madness.\n\nOne of the senior investigators entered the room, passing out dossiers on the results of the audit to everyone in attendance. The committee members looked in fascination at the findings in the report. Dai Li's intelligence network had a hub.\n\nBeyond the authority of Nanjing, in Sichuan province, the underground remnants of the Chinese Nationalist spy network took their orders from Dai Li himself. If the Juntong were headquartered there, action had to be taken immediately before Dai Li flees further beyond Japan's reach. An expedition would be organized to search and destroy those fighting until the bitter end."

japdlc.403.desc:0 "The branch of the investigative committee in Nanjing had been working fiercely after their sabotage by Chinese agents, who lied about the structure of Dai Li's resistance organization, including the Juntong, Li's spy network that made Japan's war in China an even more brutal affair. After removing the Chinese investigators, they had been able to determine a number of Juntong cells operating in China. And among their leaders was Milton Miles, an American admiral also confirmed to be alive in China, no doubt helping the Juntong however he could.\n\nInvestigator Tadano Nishi, while in discussion with his fellow agents, laid out a brilliant theory as to Admiral Miles' current situation.\n\n"Since both Dai Li and Admiral Miles are still alive," he began, "there is no doubt these two men are working together. However we have not received many letters confirming this connection."\n\n"But that doesn't mean they aren't working together. What if the two are purposeful in sending out such outdated and minute information? I've been poring through the letters available and I've noticed a few interesting patterned symbols. I've noticed only twelve of these symbols ever being used."\n\n"It has to be the Chinese calendar!" Nishi suggested, and the others nodded along in agreement. "It's a long chance, but I think it might work. And if it does, each and every one of us will be written in the records of history as the codebreakers that saved the Empire."\n\nFor days the encryption strategy of the Chinese calendar yielded nothing but swathes of hidden information, more than they had acquired in months. Nishi, a young and aspiring officer, may have just opened the door to ending this titanic conspiracy. It was clearer than ever that if Milton Miles was alive, he was operating in a Shanghai cell. Kempetei were sent immediately to the streets of the city, and the youthful investigator earned himself commendation from the highest members of the investigation."

There was indeed remnants of the Chinese Loyal Patriotic Army left in the far western regions of the country, but the claims of Dai Li hiding out in Chengde were nothing but lies.\n\nSecret police were moving in on any Chinese agents who have been deemed as "uncooperative" or even traitors. Nishi shuddered at their possible fates; the best such men could get from sabotage of the investigation was a swift hanging.\n\nShunji's superior slammed the phone shut and stormed out of his office, veins bulging from under his skin with unbridled rage.\n\n"It seems all our work since we started working with the bastard Chinese now must be destroyed." he gritted, "Every.

There was no news from any members of the Chinese agents he worked with, and he put the thoughts of dead men out of his mind.\n\nThe report was written with an aggravated tone, detailing how the true organization of the Juntong was in a number of splinter cells. To what extent the cells worked together on sharing information or how was still unsolved. But the Chinese claims of Dai Li's network being a centralized and hierarchical organization were totally false.\n\n"These results, while confirmed to be accurate, were done without working with the Nanjing government. Untrustworthy sources and the poor status of the Chinese intelligence agency caused the results to be heavily delayed." Nishi knew that whoever wrote this was likely trying their best to not curse the Chinese agents outright in an unprofessional manner, but in the world of bureaucratic investigations, this was the equivalent of spitting in a man's face.\n\nInvestigator Shunji continued to read through the file that day, finding more and more about the locations and size of Juntong cells, along with many more harsh words about Chinese officials sabotaging the committee."

Their origins stemmed from a number of locations in China, some from large cities while others feel into investigator's hands from far-flung villages and outposts, and each one contained a mess of jargon that still needed to be decoded. But the letters all were sent to a specific neighborhood, deep in the heart of Shanghai.\n\nAccording to members of the investigation and the kempeitai, the underbelly of Shanghai would serve as a likely hideout for Dai Li and other conspirators to vanish in. The sprawling harbor districts were notorious for hosting many illicit figures, and a vagabond rebel like Dai Li could hide among the Triad and no policeman would question it if he came out with his knees intact, and a small stack of bills.\n\nWith our suspect's range shrunk to the limits of the city, we can probably catch the two before they get wind and flee from Shanghai.

The best code breaking machines in our arsenal seem to find no pattern in the piles of messages delivered daily. It is near impossible any partisan could create an unbreakable code without help.\n\nSome are pointing the finger at Admiral Miles, who probably gets codes created by American computers across the Pacific, and gives them to Dai Li and any other Juntong groups in China. There could even be the possibility that there is internal sabotage, but it is more than likely that these uncrackable codes are more than what Dai Li could create, even at his height of power."

"If your claim is even the slightest bit incorrect, you will be terminated from this investigation at the least."\n\nMr. Isuzu's eyes darted frantically across the room. He had a theory yes, but who else would believe it? It would bring the whole investigation crashing down, perhaps even the country. It made no sense, but he felt it to be the case."Investigator Kawashima, I work for the decryption department. We've been seeing nothing but failure in our efforts. Every day the kempeitai deliver us piles upon piles of 'acquired documents' from raids, but there is no pattern." He cleared his throat before continuing, "These papers are not code, they are completely random characters and words thrown together."The investigator took a cigarette out from his pocket, "Isn't it your job to separate this randomness? I do understand the delays in codebreaking, and I can tell you there are people far more powerful than either of us who want it done now.""Investigator, I am telling you, look at this!" Mr. Isuzu opened a folder of documents, labelled as unimportant. "There is no pattern. We have checked this against Juntong codes, German, American, even old Russian ones!

"The kempeitai are sending these, Investigator. I cannot see any other answer. I swear to you it is true, Investigator Kawashima!" He grew more frantic with each sentence, slamming his fist down on the metal table. "They're giving us nothing! Nothing! You can ask anyone else! I swear!" all the while, Mr. Kawashima looked on in cold anger.\n\n"The kempeitai are hiding something, I can feel it. Please, look into it! Do it for yourself, for our empire! They are not telling us everything!"\n\nWhen Mr. Isuzu collapsed into his seat, his voice hoarse, Mr. Kawashima looked at him with a mix of shock and fury. He felt his blood seethe as this lone technician raved about the kempeitai. It couldn't be true. He was a madman, driven to lunacy in order to justify his lack of progress.

It might have been possible that Dai Li had infiltrated their lower ranks too, in order to remain one step ahead of his adversaries\n\nDespite their well-meaning and ultimately friendly request to examine the Kempeitai for signs of conspirator infiltration, the investigators were told to stand down by the military upon each attempt they made. Even the Home Minister received a sign of the military's scrutiny, in the form of a letter, encouraging him to "focus his attention on the actual investigation". Not wanting to be seemingly pacified by these idle demands to both himself and his investigators, the Home Minister began to consider what he could do to break through the military blockade. There were still many within the army and navy who he could count as allies. Some even owed him favors going years back. <Home Minister's Name> had a few phone calls to make and even a couple of letters to write.\n\nWithin a few days, the investigators were finally granted access to sections of the army and navy's records, particularly regarding finance.

Among these enthusiastic and oftentimes fanatical army men, there was little sign infiltration or serious corruption. Apart from the odd case of a disciplinary issue, which was better handled by the army anyway, the investigators came across nothing of any note to cause them concern.\n\nMoving up the chain of command yielded some more resistance and overall reluctant on the part of the "cooperating" officers. Questions were still answered and files were still promptly delivered to the investigating agents. Yet it was clear from the looks on the faces of the interviewees that they were starting to perhaps provoke a sense of discomfort.\n\nA couple of days later, the Home Minister received a sharp, yet polite letter from the Minister of War. Behind a genial tone, the War Minister produced a detailed summary of the action's of the investigating agents. He made a point to highlight the significant number of issues he had found with their conduct. As such, the War Minister felt it necessary to inform their superior of this issue and that it would best of all involved if he could ensure that their "over-eagerness to protect the nation" might be dialled back greatly.\n\nBy "dialled back greatly", the War Minister was in truth asking for the investigation of the army to come to an end, or at the very least become a mere reenactment of a security check. The army was not afraid to apply pressure when need be, it seemed.

Files arrived on time and interviews were carried out, always together with those seemingly ubiquitous looks of anger. Yet the agents were still able to carry out their task, albeit with an uncomfortable aura around them at all times. The investigation swept through a number of low level sections of the army and in seemingly very little time. The daunting and dangerous upper levels were next.\n\nFortunately for them, there would be a number of assets, courtesy of the Home Minister, to aid them. A number of "aligned" army personnel would make sure the operation ran smoothly. If one soldier refused to deliver a document, it would soon enough be delivered by a superior officer. Interviews went by without too much difficulty, as a word or two from the Home Minister kept the army mostly in check. It was enough to make the officers know that cooperation would lead to a hastened promotion and not a hastened retirement. All in all, the assistance of the Home Minister was more than enough to aid his investigation.\n\nAmong the plethora of unusual and suspicious documents collected by the investigating agents, a selection of financial records stood out the most. The first detail of note, was that they concerned a number of Kempeitai officers. The second detail was that these officers had become obscenely wealthy over the course of only a few weeks. Money had seeming been poured into the welfare of these Military Police Officers, yet at no point did the record state why this had been authorised.\n\nA new series of interviews, all approved with great reluctance, by the Minister of War, were conducted. Some of the soldiers had heard rumours of fortunes materialising for certain officers among the Kempeitai. What these rumours hadn't told them anything of a source for the yen, the soldiers had come to an agreed hypothesis.

Their interrogations of the junior officers seemed to yield little of much interest. Documents and files produced similar results. Deciding that they were clearly being given only a fraction of what was actually available for them to read, the agents set about demanding direct access to the navy archives.\n\nIt did not take long for the War Minister to take note of what was happening. His response to what seemed to him like a severe transgression was to dispatch a letter to the Home Minister. It arrived just as he was about to sit down for dinner. The letter was short, written with a considerably more genial tone than the Home Minister was used to the War Minister using. The intent revealed that more usual tone.\n\nThe War Minister had written to express his concern that the investigation into Dai Li was focusing its attention in the wrong places. Not only was this a serious worry for the War Ministry, but the manner in which the investigation was being carried out seemed to bother them as well. While deeply polite in its prose, the letter ended with a warning:\n\n"We fear that should your agents continue along their current course, they may perhaps cause more trouble then they are worth"\n\nThe Home Minister, by now used to such hints othreats, decided that this was just a sign that he was looking in the right direction.

It was certainly a disappointing end to another few weeks of hard work for them.\n\nThey had examined financial,recruitment and diplomatic records for tracers of anything incriminating, and turned up empty handed. Interviews provided little else of use to the investigation. Even a number of ships were searched. Cargo was opened and checked and some boats were even partially dismantled to check for hidden compartments or storage areas. Nothing beyond the official records was ever found It would never be quite possible to tell exactly what the Navy was doing, for there was certainly a number of secrets that they would rather die than let slip, but they were not harbouring the pawns of Dai Li.\n\nWhile the lack of proper results was never a positive, the Home Minister was at least relieved to be able to check the Navy of the list. The amusing thought of holding any and all meetings relevant to the Dai Li situation on navy ships from this point crossed his mind before he regained focus. There were other paths for the investigation to pursue. <Home Minister's name> hoped that they would be resolved as easily as the Navy had been.\n\nSome had suggested that attempting to clear the army of suspicion would be a wise choice. It was in many ways quite dangerous to let either branch of the military operate without being cleared of suspicions, especially if Dai Li had turned so many officers into his puppets. Yet examining the military had certain "political" complications too, just as with the Navy.\n\nAs the Home Minister began to retire for the night, his head was filled with the choices he would once again have to make. It was never an easy choice, seemingly growing more difficult as the options narrowed. Failure seemed like a dangerously palpable possibility as this point. It would be another long night for the Home Minister."

The army, already somewhat reluctant in their cooperation, quickly turned against the agents in subtle ways.\n\nInterviews began to drag on for much longer. The officer's being questioned would either jump around answering the agents, or produce absurdly long answers that never seemed to quite reach any sort of true meaning. The investigators met great difficulty in even getting the army to provide them with officers willing to be questioned. If they ever agreed to be interrogated, they would arrive late or only comply with meeting the agents at particularly late or early hours.\n\nNot even physical evidence could be relied upon at this point. The army was surprisingly happy to honour the request made by the investigators to see a number of files relating to their finances, recruitment and interactions with other sections of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. If the files were not suddenly lost in transit across the bureaucratic web, then they ended up being severely damaged in transit. The few files that did arrive in decent condition turned out to be the wrong documents and were sent back, never to be heard of again.\n\nThe investigators back to the Home Minister did not paint a picture of a particularly functional work environment for his agents. Despite it all, some scant progress had been made, mostly by rearranging ripped, or possibly shredded, papers. This had been part of what he had anticipated the army's initial response to be. There was still much work to be done and yet at the same time the pressure was becoming a serious problem. The Home Minister could either continue his investigation, or cut his losses and try another route. Neither option seemed particularly pleasant to him as he considered the possibilities to come."

japdlc.507.desc:0 "While the Kempeitai officers were currently out of reach, having been reported as "out on covert assignment", their families were not. Fortunately for the investigation, that was where the trail of money led them. The Kempeitai official's suddenly discovered fortunes had not been sent directly to their bank accounts. Instead, the money had gone towards their close relations, whether that be their girlfriends, wives, parents or siblings.\n\nThe interviews with these relatives went well. Some coaxing was initially required, as many of them felt anxious about their money possibly being taken away from them. Their fears were eventually quelled with the realisation of the investigators actual interest. Among those questioned, the universal story was that of a charitable donation having been made to them due to their Kempeitai family member. The benefactor was always anonymous, at least to the recipients of their money.\n\nTheories raged as to just where the money could be coming from. Naturally, there were many ideas tossed about beyond the money merely coming from Dai Li, or an associate of his. Some suggested interference from powerful business groups, perhaps a Keiretsu trying to utilise members of the Kempeitai against their competitors. Possible American involvement was the idea that intrigued the investigators most. They wouldn't put it past the CIA to attempt to corrupt part of the military police into leaking valuable information or to overlook one or two spies.\n\nHypotheses aside, there was still much work to do to verify any one of them. The reports of mysterious sums of yen appearing out of thin air were certainly not good signs, no matter who the cash originally belonged to in the first place. The paper trail was there, the agents needed only to locate it."

There were many more ships to search, interviews to conduct and files to analyse. In order to see the job done at twice the pace, the Home Minister had arranged for reinforcements to be sent to the investigation sites belonging to the Navy.\n\nThe Navy was ready too. After realising that the agents would not back down from their tasks, they had realised that a new strategy would need to be employed. The Navy would seek to delay and tamper with the investigation as much as possible. With the discreet blessing of both the Admiralty and the War Ministry, the Navy was fully prepared to hinder the agents of the Home Minister as much as they could.\n\nOn the very surface, little seemed to change for the investigation. The Navy, still ever hostile in tone, did in fact agree to comply with whatever the agents required. Beneath the surface however, there was a distinctly different environment awaiting them as they searched for clues. Ships due to be searched were suddenly sent out on assignment. Files were mysteriously transferred between archives for indefinite amounts of time. If they survived this endless journey, the documents would either be severely damaged or occasionally and miraculously arrive as intended.\n\nThe investigation ground to a sickening halt. In terms of viable leads, the agents where now dealing with the crumbs of breadcrumbs. It was uncertain if they would be able to garner much of anything from what little they had at this point. The Home Minister was naturally displeased with the development, as he had hoped the Navy would back down. Yet again he would have to consider whether the secrets of the Navy were truly worth the trouble. Perhaps he could strike out against them in his own way to counter their efforts."

While they were yet to find its end, the investigators felt confident that they might soon find it. The army had tried to handicap them at every possible turn, but enough information slipped through grasp for the agents to make observations.From the Home Minister's perspective, it seemed as if his hardline perseverance would pay off in the long run. It might harm his already shaky relations with the War Ministry, but that was simply part of the political day-to-day. Soon enough the investigation would be completed, and the War Minister would be of no concern.\n\nA letter from that very man changed the Home Minister's outlook in a flash. In contrast to the War Minister's previous letters, this one entirely lacked the calm and cordial tone that he had previously employed. There would be no pretense of friendship this time."Should you continue this ridiculous stunt of yours, then I will be forced to enact drastic measures that you and the rest of your colleagues cannot recover from". A sense of impending defeat washed over the Home Minister as he continued to read.\n\n"You must surely know that I have allies in the Diet that would be more than happy to see the Prime Minister removed from office. If you know that, then you must also be aware of the fact that I possess the means of making their ambitions possible. Put a stop to your investigation and return to your senses immediately."\n\nThat was not a challenge. It was a loaded pistol pointed right at the head of the Home Minister. He had no choice but to stand down and refocus the eyes of the investigation elsewhere. For all his connections within the military, it seemed they were not yet susceptible to outside interference. Perhaps there would be other opportunities."

japdlc.510.t:0 "Meetings in Shanghai"
japdlc.510.desc:0 "As they so often do, the trail was found far from where the investigation had least expected it. The Home Minister, as per his job description, had contacts in virtually every branch of the Japanese government and military. Most rumours therefore made their way to his ears sooner or later. Loose lips in the war ministry provided him with a rather peculiar fact. A number of Kempeitai officers were on their way to Shanghai. Not only this, but orders supposedly from a Dai Li agent had just been intercepted outside the city. It was simply too big of a coincidence for the investigation to pass up on.\n\nWith a sense of direction restored, the investigating agents rushed to their new target. The investigation would look towards local officials for possible leads. A large enough bribe or a serious enough threat made all but the most stubborn of them comply with the investigation. Piece by piece, the trail reformd once again, All of the Kempeitai agents had booked into the Astor House Hotel.\n\nIt was simple enough to "win" the hotel over to their side . A phone call from the Home Minister assured the Astor House's manager that they would receive a rather generous donation should they comply with the investigation's demands. Relatively few of the officers left the hotel for more than a stroll through the streets, most stayed in their rooms or gathered in the lobby to discuss trivial matters. Yet after about two days of this seemingly dull routine, the officers would one by one visit the reception desk and book themselves into the conference room. They would all be attending some sort of meeting between two and five o'clock the next day, and at least two unnamed individuals would be joining them.\n\nAs the day of the meeting arrived, the investigation, together with local police units stood ready to burst into the hotel conference room and arrest all those present. For that to happen, they would need the express approval of the senior investigating officer, who acted as an emissary for the Home Minister. Until he gave the command, the agents of the Home Ministry would watch the meeting, lest they miss some important building."

japdlc.511.desc:0 "The War Minister's letters had piled up upon the desk of the Home Minister. He had stopped reading them about a week ago. After the fourth, or possibly fifth threat of "dangerous consequences", The Home Minister had grown tired of their ubiquitous content. For as long as letters from the War Ministry continued to arrive at his office, the Home Minister knew that the investigation was not complete.\n\nThe state of the Investigation was at that time, like that of someone trying to fit a jigsaw together with only a fraction of the required pieces.The rest of the jigsaw was locked away and guarded day and night. This was the true focus of the investigating agents at the present. While a skeleton crew worked on deciphering the information they had available to them, the rest of the agents worked on devising plans to acquire the documents they truly needed to actually make a breakthrough.\n\nIn the dead of night, a black car stopped a few streets away from the Naval Archives. The building was eerily quiet as the two agents who had just exited their vehicle headed towards it. It didn't take long for them to notice the lack of any guards outside the front gate, which had instead been crudely secured with a chain. After realising that there were no signs of life on the inside of the archive compound either, the chain was removed by way of bolt cutters.\n\nThe archive entrance itself had not even been shut properly, with one door hanging quite ajar, swaying slightly with the breeze. With someone undoubtedly wrong with the Naval archives, the two agents determined that they were possibly walking into a trap. Using the scant moonlight, one agent pointed a hand mirror at an angle through the open door to reveal... nothing. It was not that the reflection revealed no guards or that there was nothing of particular interest immediately inside. No, the archive's main hall was empty of anything at all. Every document, recording and file was missing. Pinned to the wall opposite the door was a note, labeled in large characters as:"For the Home Ministry"\n\n"Due to security concerns regarding a number of our archives, including this one, the War Minister has seen fit to move their contents to a number of new and secure locations. The Admiralty and the War Ministry humbly apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused"\n\nThe investigation was at this point practically pleading with the Home Minster to find an end to the conflict with the Navy, or otherwise focus on other leads regarding Dai Li. Ultimately, the Home Minister alone had the deciding power. Therefore, he elected to:"

They had three hours to witness a crime taking place. After that, the officers would disperse around the building, making it much harder to take them in for questioning. For the moment, the agents of the Home Minister would stand by, waiting for the proper moment to arrest everyone inside the conference room. Observations continued, as they were joined by members of the Shanghai police force.\n\nThe conference itself was proving to be rather dull. Although it had officially begun, the Kempeitai officers present were still idly talking amongst themselves, with seemingly no coherent conversation between the lot of them. They could only be awaiting something to happen, that was seemingly out of their hands. An hour passed and still nothing happened. From their vantage point in a dubiously acquired apartment across the street, the agents could see the senior Kempeitai being to check his watch more frequently. They were overdue for something to happen, possibly a late arrival.\n\nAnother hour passed and the mood in the conference room was growing more and more uneasy. They had been aware of some sort of delay, but nothing of this length. The conference would be over, at least officially, in just under one hour. All the agents could do, was continue to wait."

Had any of the Kempeitai considered exiting through a third storey window, then their last sight would have been of their mangled body being handcuffed by agents awaiting them on the street below. Not one of the assembled figures took a second look at the windows.\n\nThe actual arrests were smooth enough. The officers in the conference room quietly surrendered themselves and were handcuffed, saying nothing as they were escorted out of the hotel through a back door. The Shanghai police force had been enthusiastic in aiding the operation, with more than a little contempt on display for the Kempeitai. Despite the occasional punch or baton to the stomach, the prisoners arrived mostly in one piece. They were to be isolated from one another, with each one getting their own remote cell. Interviews began shortly after, before any one of the Kempeitai officers had time to devise a smart enough alibi.\n\nIt quickly became clear that the Kempeitai were more than prepared for being questioned. They all remained calm during their questioning, speaking only to answer questions and always giving a succinct answer. As more time passed without the investigation being able to extract any information from the Kempeitai officers, the more dangerous their imprisonment became. Sooner or later, the army would get word of the conference having been raided, and begin causing a serious diplomatic meltdown back in Japan. Time was running out for the investigating agents."

It had taken them quite some time to compile and consisted of a number of loose threads that they had just about managed to inelegantly tie off . After failing to recover anything from the Naval archives, the agents had been forced to stoop even more by further committing acts of petty burglary. After locating their much-needed sources, the investigation had staged over a dozen break-ins across Naval bases in the Home Islands.\n\nTheft had at least procured them some of the information they needed. It was just about enough to finally, after many months of borderline insane scuffles with the Navy, to put an end to this branch of the Dai Li investigation. In truth, a great deal of the agents had suspected the worst for some time now. Their scant sources had in no way suggested any involvement or infiltration by Dai Li. Financial reports hinted at some funding being kept secret, possibly for covert research operations. Beyond this, there was nothing of value to be learned, least of all in connection to Dai Li. There was nothing to do but report the facts to the Home Minister.\n\nThe Home Minister had little to say on the investigation for the next few days. He remained in his office for almost all of the work day, leaving only for essential cabinet meetings. To his investigative staff he gave only simple instructions, that they should " begin to pursue new leads" or otherwise set about "returning borrowed Navy property". The staff, on the other hand, saw it as the closest thing to a break that they would be getting in some time."

This unease seemed to grow all the more real as the seconds ticked by, summoning up images of the Home Ministry agents being caught in a trap themselves. Just as quickly as those images were summoned, they were then banished by an agent speaking over the radio...\n\n"Wait...I think we might finally have something\". A particularly unremarkable man, who had nearly escaped the attention of the agent stationed near the hotel's entrance, had just entered the conference room. To the agents monitoring the development from afar, he looked as though he might have been just another Kempeitai officer, using a heavy coat and wide-brimmed hat to cover disguise himself out on the streets. Yet as he removed his garments, it became clear that he was very much not just another of the assembled men.\n\nHis clothes were not what caught the eyes of the agents, but his face. That was a face they had seen before. During the very beginning of the investigation, a dossier containing files on anyone close to Dai Li not accounted for during war had been passed around. The very same face had appeared in an old photograph of Dai Li, standing right beside him. The man in Astor House had aged of course, but it could be him.\n\nA near deathly silence took hold over the agents, as they watched the Kempeitai calmly listen to the Dai Li operative, as if they had all met many times before and become the most trusted of allies.

The contact would receive just enough care to keep him alive and slowly recovering, but not enough comfort to allow him to relax in the face of interrogation. While the investigation might need to hold off on their most aggressive and uncomfortable methods, there were still plenty of options for how they could squeeze information out of the Dai Li operative.\n\nThe Kempeitai agents on the other hand, were left in their cells. The investigation had little interest in the mere acomplacies of the Dai Li, especially now that they had a direct link to the man himself. By keeping them merely locked up and well fed, the army could do little more than grumble. They of course would demand the release of the Kempeitai officers, but beyond that they were essentially powerless as long as the officers were not directly harmed.\n\nWithout any form of anaesthetic, the chinese contact was in constant pain. His broken limbs were suspended to keep them straight while healing, only served to drag out his excruciating experience. An anaesthetic was of course readily available, as the agents were ever so willing to inform him. There was a catch, as expected. The anaesthetic was available to him should he be willing to part with everything he knew about Dai Li and his connections to the Japanese army. He was asked to answer this on several occasions, but the agents would always be met with a blank stare. Even when they put just a little bit of pressure on his broken bones, they would only elicit a slight wince or twinge, never more.\n\nThe investigation, although disappointed with their captives unwillingness to cooperate, was still confident that he would snap sooner or later.

This was the case with the investigation and their newly "acquired" Kempeitai prisoners. While they were hardened men of military background, there were still a number of methods that could prove effective. Many of those methods were ones that the Kempeitai had employed themselves, tried and tested across the sphere. The native Shanghai police had been particularly forthcoming with the details of this methods of interrogation, having heard the stories of their application over the years. Behind clothes and bolted doors, the agents of the investigation began their bloody and agonizing work.\n\nOne by one, the Kempeitai officers were escorted to a small room at the back of the police station. After an invariable amount of time, they would return. Some had been cut, others beaten, some had been burned and others seemingly electrocuted. The investigation knew that they could withstand most forms of torture, and that killing one of them "by mistake" would not soften them up during questioning. This would be a battle of attrition. The longer that they were locked up, away from the wider world, the more worn down they would become. If they started to believe that no help was coming for them, then they would snap. After all, if this was loyalty's reward, then what good was keeping military secrets, really?\n\nThe military had been aware of the matter for some time, however. The dramatic raid of the Astor House has been hard for them to miss. Army intelligence was quickly able to locate where the Kempeitai officers were being held. With the knowledge that the Kempeitai officers were being detained, the war ministry was swift to issue a diplomatic protest against the investigation. While the Home Minister would keep the army busy by means of rescheduling their meetings about the matter at the last moment, the investigation would continue their interrogations.

While the the police were left to deal with the men in the conference room, two agents pursued the chinese contact down the hall.\n\nBy the time they had managed to turn the corner, he had already made his way through the emergency exit. The alarm connected to the door now blared throughout the hallway, causing a panicked wave of hotel guests to exit their rooms. The agents were forced to shove their way past as dozens of guests tried to rush towards the exits. After barging their way through, the agents were greeted by the sight of two of their own at the bottom of the spiral staircase. They had seen the contact for a split second, before he had disappeared back into the hotel through the first storey door. Blocked by the mass of guests descending the stairs at the same time, the agents awaiting below had no chance to fire upon him.\n\nEntering the hotel once again, the now four agents followed the trail of opened doors. With no rooms on these floors, he could only have attempted to leave through another fire escape, the main entrance or a staff entrance. Yet these paths would have this point been blocked off to him, any attempt would have resulted in arrest or death.

He finished his retort with a brief chuckle. Deciding that their prisoner was perhaps growing too comfortable with his present conditions, one of the agents grabbed him by the face and thrust him to the ground.\n\n"The time for answers is now. If you continue to fail to understand your situation, you will suffer worse by the end of the day."\n\nDazed by the pain at the back of his head, the Kempeitai officer continued to lay on the floor. As he did so, the two agents circled above him, as if they were vultures about to feast on a dying animal.\n\n"It would be simple enough for us to make you disappear. Do you think your colleagues will want you alive after what you have told us already?"\n\nAs if in response, the officer's eyes snapped open. He attempted to lift himself back up but was forced to the ground again. His eyes became fixed to the ceiling for a good moment, before he exhaled.\n\n"You're never going to find Dai Li. We don't know where he is. We don't even know if he is alive. The report we gave you was nothing short of an investigative travesty. Yet here you are,at your wit's end, looking for ghosts and conspiracies! "\n\nHe laughed again, before a kick to the ribs cut him short. The officer spluttered on the floor, before resuming his answer. This time, there was a rage in his voice, as if the kick had only made him more desperate to speak.\n\n"Ask any one of my peers these questions enough, and they will snap, and then tell you exactly what I am telling you now. The Dai Li you want is nothing more than a story that we cooked up, to cover our own asses! Now, you have your answer.\n\nHis final attempt to rise from the ground awarded him a kick to the face. It knocked him out cold. The guard sent in to remove the unconscious officer found the two agents sitting in opposite corners of the room with their heads in their laps.

One would have been foolish to write all of the prisoners off as die-hard military loyalists, as shown by their willingness to take bribes from mysterious benefactors. Perhaps if their financial situations were to be taken care off, then they would be open to discussing their backroom deals.\n\nOther methods were employed too. Officers who had expressed great faith in the military soon arriving to release them were specifically told that they had been abandoned by their superiors. Some of the Kempeitai were subjected to volleys of questions, that were directed to them at random with either a great deal of aggression or geniality.\n\nStubbornness had been expected, considered by the investigation to be part and parcel when dealing with members of the military.

Why tell you this, and then refuse to aid you in any meaningful way? Every time you've lifted the curtain just a little bit higher than the Kempeitai, what have you found? Nothing. "\n\nThe agents of the investigation did not respond when the chinese contact finished giving them the answer to the question they had asked him so many times. One stared at the floor, while the other rested his head against the cool brick wall. It was just about beginning to click into place. One report from the Kempeitai had spawned all this. A mere whisper of a ghost haunting China had sent the entire political establishment into a thunderous panic.\n\nThe agent with his head against the wall produced a sigh of both great anguish and great relief. "Phone the Home Minister, tell him that investigation has taken a new turn. Tell him that, and that we are on our way to Nanjing""

japdlc.700.t:0 "Unannounced Army Manuevers"
japdlc.700.d:0 "Earlier this morning, the Chief of the Army sent a letter to the Home Office. It arrived onto the Prime Minister's desk, a seal of the Army granting its envelope protection against prying eyes. A top-secret matter, then, for both the Army and the Government of Japan. The letter lay in the open, its seal exuding a dread from the contents housed within. The question was clear from the start: why all this secrecy?\n\nUnbinding the seal, [Root.GetLeader] unfolded the envelope. Inside was a piece of paper, neatly typed and spaced. Its contents were unremarkable. The Army planned exercises to take place throughout Japan to test the readiness of the troops and reservists in cases of sudden attacks. The reason for secrecy answered itself: the enemy cannot know that Japan prepared to meet its enemy in the field.\n\nThe implication, however, was grim. The "Great Conspiracy," as those in-the-know within the cabinet dubbed it, was quickly becoming capable of shaking the very foundation of the Japanese state. Hands trembling, he picked up the telephone's handset. He dialed the number of the Army offices and asked to talk to the Chief for a moment. After a brief exchange, the Army agreed to postpone the exercises for a few days. Collapsing into the chair, [Root.GetLeader] breathed a sigh of relief. He had delayed chaos for a few days."

The inner-city rail ran on time today and hit all its stops without any problems, ferrying people safely and speedily. From the Imperial Palace, it looked as if today would be beautiful, idyllic, even.\n\nLines of uniformed men marched from the Navy's base in Yokosuka. Their destination: the Palace. The civilian government had failed the people of Japan, and it was up to her sons in the armed services to save her from doom. They were a curiosity to bystanders; armed to the teeth and wearing khaki uniforms, they walked the streets in full view of all they encounter on the way.\n\nThey were not alone in this line of thought. From the Saitama Prefecture, the Army made their own move. Laws and propriety be damned; now is the time for the inferiors to rule from below, outside the structure. If all it took to save Japan were only a few violations of the rules, they would do it every time.\n\nThese conflicting forces would come against one another like waves against a wall; in the middle of Japan, they met. Unslinging their rifles and pointing it at each other, yet refusing to fire, they would garrison the buildings in the capital, maintaining the unstable equilibrium. The panicked Parliament mobilized the 1st Guards Division and ordered them to defend the Diet building as well as the Imperial Palace."

Confused as to what their next move would be, both Army and Navy units had begun their initiatives in the countryside, occupying the minor towns and villages without sharing intelligence.\n\nWhere Army units marched into Navy territories, however, firefights break out. While not on the scale of a civil war or even the Mukden incident, firefights broke out as no one in either service could ascertain if the other was planning a takeover of Japan.\n\nIn one notable event, an Army unit entered a town occupied by another Army division during the night. The latter opened fire, mistaking the uniforms of the former for Navy ones. It took half an hour to defuse the situation, and by then, a dozen men had already died.\n\nThough the central government is in no state to entirely halt the movement of its armed forces, they still control police units throughout the country. A risky move would be to use these to slow down the progress of the Army and the Navy before chaos could erupt; however, should these units perish, the government would have no other means of restoring control and order."

The Army and the Navy occupy a third of the city each, taking the capital in a vicelike grip and paralyzing the government. Both were unwilling to listen to orders to stand down and held their ground. There was a silver lining, at least: the Army and the Navy had refused to open fire on one another, and the 1st Guards Divisions were giving and receiving the same treatment.\n\nSomeone tapped his shoulder. [Root.GetLeader] turned. It was his aide, apologizing to be so rude, but that nevertheless he had a piece of news to deliver. Judging from his expression, [Root.GetLeader] guessed that the gods hadn't stepped down to stop this madness, only to add more to it. Hearing what the aide said, however, made his shoulders slump deep.\n\nThe War Minister was dead. The news came this morning when the minister's son, who lived close, visited the house and found that someone had broken through the door. In the living room, clutching a revolver in his last moments, was his father, with several bruises and stab wounds on his head and torso. The police found no clear suspects and the Army, suspecting the Navy to be behind all of this, can barely contain their anger.\n\nTime was of the essence. To the Prime Minister, there were only two options: to throw the Army a bone and let them decide on a War Minister or appoint the Chief of Staff as interim minister until all of this blows over. Phone in hand, he called the Army's offices again, his choice already made."

Here was the Army, one of the proudest institutions of the Japanese state, deliberating for too long for a matter so simple yet so crucial. He cracked his knuckles and tapped his foot; anxiety had taken over his nerves. The office hours became unbearably long, and each knock on his door signaled hope but delivered no catharsis. The Army had not reached a consensus.\n\nA rap on the door. An aide came forward with a smile on her face and offered a name for [Root.GetLeader] to appoint as War Minister. Finally! He took out a piece of paper and prepared a speech for the inauguration of the new candidate. A few minutes later, just after he finished drafting the address, another aide came, bearing another name. Half an hour later, another one. At the end of the day, there were more than a dozen names on his desk. Which one to appoint? Where was the consensus? These questions ran through his mind.\n\nHe summoned the aides back to his room and questioned them. "Where did you get this name?" He asked. The answer diverged from one another, from many sources advocating for many candidates. He ordered them out. He was less angry than shocked and horrified: the Army had not agreed to a single candidate, teetering on the edge of collapse. There was no time to waste; throwing propriety and procedure out the window, he drafted his decision: the Chief of Staff was to serve as War Minister..."

He would need all the help he could get from all the organs of the government. Telegrams, letters, phone calls, the whole lot: his timetable for the next few days would be full, and his family was out there, in the country engulfed in chaos. He wondered if it was all worth it, shaking and sighing the thought away. It was his duty to his Emperor; he could do no less.\n\nHe picked up the phone and started dialing the first numbers that emerged his head. General this and that, currently last known whereabouts in this district in that prefecture. He wanted to reign in the most dangerous ones. The Army and the Navy needed to cool down. Armed forces should be out of the capital as soon as possible. He mouthed a silent prayer before lifting the receiver and speaking..."

japdlc.706.t:0 "War Minister Partially Successful"
japdlc.706.d:0 "The Minister was tired, exhausted. The work of the last few days had humiliated him, and the strain of staying for hours on end had made his eyebags sink even deeper into his face. The Emperor and the Prime Minister had tied him to a horse and let it drag him for the amusement of both the Army and the Navy. He whispered in private company that he loathed his job, but he must shoulder his duty like a loyal subject of the Emperor. He wished that the Emperor would intervene and lighten his load, and shine a light that would bring the country together.\n\nAt least, he had achieved a breakthrough. The Army had bombarded a navy base yesterday. If it had happened any other way, it would have been a disaster on an unprecedented scale. However, the news reached him: the attack had wounded no one. Sobriety had returned to both the Army and the Navy, as no further attacks had occurred. He hoped that this incidental show of force would be enough to convince the armed forces that conflict amongst them would only hurt the Japanese people.\n\nOf course, chatter still filled through the Army radios, proclaiming that the Marines of the Navy had run like dogs and abandoned the base before the bombardment commenced. Their counterpart, however, retorted by saying that the artillery units could not aim to save their lives. He did not care which is true and which is not; truth does not matter, only results."

japdlc.707.d:0 ""Prime Minister, Prime Minister!" A hurried aide burst through the doors of [Root.GetLeader]'s office, demanding an audience immediately. [Root.GetLeader] looked at him, and decided that his message would determine if the breach of protocol and etiquette was worth it. If the aide had eyes or ears, he would have known that the Prime Minister was a busy man these days. The country was, figuratively, on fire, and he needed all hands on deck to help extinguish the flames that threaten to consume his beloved country.\n\n"What is it now, Tanaka?" the Prime Minister asked, raising his eyebrows, "I am a busy man. Pray that your message has weight, for we cannot afford distractions at this juncture that fate has presented us."\n\n"It is very important, sir," Tanaka said, breathing raggedly, his hands on his knees, "I bring a message from the communications bureau." He took a deep breath and rose, his sweat a thin film above his face, "We have established contact with the city of Nagoya. We had previously thought that all communications were cut; that seems not to be the case. We need to send a message." He sighed, "The people across the country will demand to know what is going on. Silence is not an option here, sir."\n\nBefore Tanaka had said the last few phrases of his message, [Root.GetLeader] had known that silence would only permit the fires to run unabated through Japan. What should he say? He had two clear options on his head. The first is to admit to the scale of the problem, which would turn the people against the armed forces. The second is to lie and state that the cause of the chaos was terrorism, espionage, whatever that diverted attention from the Army and the Navy. He opened his mouth to speak."
japdlc.707.a:0 "We cannot hide this forever."

"Down with the government!" was a rallying cry heard in Japanese cities, as the people began to lose faith in the Prime Minister and his cabinet. The Army and the Navy, meanwhile, was left untouched in the wake of the protests, often hailed as heroes that that defended the country from barbarians wreaking havoc against the will of the emperor.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] had jeopardized the prospects of his government continuing by deciding to take the blame for the Army and the Navy's conflict. Historians would look upon this event with a favorable eye, that of a government willing to sacrifice itself for the good of the nation. However, as things stood, everything seemed bleak, with the future obscured without a clear way forward."
japdlc.708.a:0 "A necessary sacrifice."

japdlc.709.t:0 "Anti-Army Protests"
japdlc.709.d:0 "The streets were tense and hot; the beaming sun baked the concrete roads and cooked the buildings, reflecting sunlight off of the glass and searing those filling the streets underneath. The swathes of crowds gathered to protest the recent treatment of Nishi were maddened by the intense rays of sun beating down on them. They were divided into two groups; veterans, who set up small encampments outside of the Diet building to demand the full force of the law to fall on Nishi, and pacifists, who urged the government intervene to diffuse the situation entirely with a full pardon. \n\nThe intense heat spread a hysteria between the two crowds heckling from either side of the street. Both sides waved placards, yelled accusations, and threw small fragments of debris across the road at their opposition. Enraged and impassioned by the crowds, a student broke from the front-lines of the pacifists' crowd and charged to skirmish with a band of particularly aggressive veterans, and a great swarm was compelled to follow him. A great roar erupted from the street, followed soon after by the chatter and collision of makeshift batons, shields, and other equipment fashioned as weapons to fight the opposition. \n\nGreat crowds of people clashed in small groups throughout the street, tumbling on the floor and tussling with each other against brick walls and metal debris. The stench of violence grew thick in the warm sun, and brutality became a common sight between the groups. Eventually, law enforcement had arrived in heavily-armed droves to diffuse the chaos, but even their sirens and loud-speakers could not prize many off of barbarically mauling and attacking their countrymen in the streets of the capital."

For now, the civilian government and the Yokusankai can only wait, in bated breath for the next unravelling by either branch of the military.\n\n"Who knew the continued existence of the Co-Prosperity Sphere depended on a single intelligence screw-up in Chengdu?"\n\nThe answer to that question was the military. Throughout the entire Sphere, the Army and the Navy are both currently engaging in a war of deception - an intensification of the already existing interservice rivalry within an already fragile system. Rumours of officer's purges, assasination lists and equipment procurement flood the civilian government's ministries day by day, yet [Root.GetLeader] still has an ace up his sleeve - the Daihon'ei. The independent joint chiefs of staff that was supposed to coordinate the efforts of the Army and the Navy.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe red telephone rang. [Root.GetLeader] knew what it meant.

The radicals aboard her had seized control over the ship, citing the civilian government's inability to handle the current crisis. The Naval Authority had authorized the deployment of special forces, while the remaining loyalists attempted to distract the ship from opening its anti-air guns.\n\nA few kilometers away from the objective, Ishikawa saw the pride of the Japanese fleet - a humongous dreadnought with guns that could tear any other battleship at sea. True to the loyalists' words, the ship's guns were quiet. Too quiet. Ishikawa was expecting a few gunshots to drift their way. The helicopter landed on the Yamato's stern, and the special forces split up. Forty people, with state-of-the-art weapons and gear. Yet, everything was silent. The halls were empty. They stepped down into the hold, ready to meet a burst of machinegun fire.\n\nBodies. Bodies of shirtless young men keeled forward in Seppuku.

This was a situation which needed to be delicately handled. One more unit wiped out, the closer Japan gets to total anarchy. Anarchy caused, yet again by a single intelligence fuck-up in Chengdu.

He takes a sip from the glass of water in front of him, and awaits Takayama's questions.\n\n"So, Mr. Prime Minister, before our break we were talking about recent investments into Choson?"\n\n"Well, yes: recently we've been investing in infrastructure in the northern border along the Yalu River - but construction planners and teams have been sabotaged lately. Nothing new, probably just bandits crossing over from Manchukuo."\n\n"May I ask whether the Army was inquired into this?"\n\nA slight hesitation forms on [Root.GetLeader]'s face. "No", he said.\n\n"Well, if I may inquire - why not?"\n\n"Well, there were complications in the command structure, and- and- you know what Takayama-san, let's move on shall we?"\n\n"Very well. Next up on our agenda is the car bombings in Eastern Osaka: What do you have to sa-"\n\nThe host's jaw dropped in hesitation as [Root.GetLeader] stood up, politely bowed him goodbye and walked offstage.

This was basically a kangaroo court, little difference from what he had seen throughout the Sphere. However, seeing that treatment being given upon military men: his comrades-in-arms was unacceptable. As he felt himself losing control, Mr. Kinji lets out a deep sigh as he leaned back into the sofa.\n\nIn his head he contemplates heading back to Nakano - maybe for some more emergency meetings with the Veteran's Association.

Nishi, ordered to be silent in the defendant's stand, sat before the judges and gazed into the thin air in front of him; the court could not afford for his celebrity-like status to draw attention from the plaintiff's prosecutions.\n\nAfter a short hearing of a witness, the outcry of the jury showed clear division between pro-Nishi and anti-Nishi camps.

Increased numbers of police units have been deployed across Japanese cities, and the public have been asked by law enforcement to avoid areas where the protesters are expected to be marching.

Nishi's in court right now, for conspiracy or some other bullshit charge!" \n\nMr. Kinji looked at his friend in disbelief; how could Nishi Takeichi, the Olympian and war hero, even be considered to have committed such horrid crimes? Blinking repeatedly, Mr. Kinji inquired further about the nonsense now case all over the news.\n\n"You heard me right, friend. The man who we all looked up to is now on trial for trumped-up charges of high treason. Some horseshit about plotting to overthrow the government or something. Either way, that's not the man we knew. They'd ought to end the case before the whole nation is up in arms!" \n\nOvercome with a confused outrage, Mr. Kinji sat by his friends and read from the newspapers.

Organisations from all across the political spectrum have been galvanized by what they brand as 'an insult to justice and the truth'. Skirmishes with law enforcement have become more common, and the amber haze of civil unrest has arisen in major cities afflicted with disruptive marches.

Closing his eyes for a brief moment, Nishi knew this would be the last time he would see his homeland. \n\nMr. Nishi was ordered to be exiled away from the Home Isles for his crimes, and was subsequently being sent to Bengal to live out the rest of his days. The humid, foreign lands under the jurisdiction of the Azad Hind government were decided to be his new home as they were the most distant and most alien to what he knew and grew up with in Tokyo.

The news of Nishi's trial had not been received well by the Chrysanthemum throne, a feeling that he expressed plainly on his face. The Emperor had even arrived late to the privy council meeting, which was particularly unusual. For half an hour, he had remained silent, barely even moving his eyes to look at the assembled council. Even the words of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal had not stirred the Emperor enough to say even a simple 'yes' or a 'no'.\n\nRegardless, the Privy Council was desperate for the Emperor to speak, as it seemed increasingly likely that his voice would be the only thing that would calm the country. Protests against Nishi's sentence had become increasingly common and most were growing in size by the day. No amount of policing or promises by the government had so far worked. Indeed, the Emperor's voice was in fact their last chance.\n\n"Your Imperial Majesty, we once again beg of you to consider our request. Think of your subjects, think of your Empire!"\n\nWithout as much as a word, or a chance in his facial expression, the Emperor stood up and departed from the room. The Privy Council President returned to his seat, too stunned to comment on what had just happened. The rest of the council were similarly shocked.

There had therefore been no time to find him a proper cell. Besides, the protesters outside the courthouse would have likely swarmed the car had they tried to take Nishi much further than a few city blocks away. In the brief hours he had stayed in the cell, Nishi had found the time to consider what he would say before his execution. He would reaffirm his innocence, and once again call on the military to do what was right for the nation. He did not wish to die, but fear was not what filled his mind when he thought about the execution. If anything, he felt disappointed at the state of the nation. How could the Emperor let this happen?\n\n"Sir? Colonel Nishi, are you there?\n\nFrom out of the shadows came the figures of three prison guards.\n\n"What do you want? Do you have something for me?\n\nThe Colonel was unsure how to react to their respectful tone.\n\n"We do sir. We've brought you the means to escape."\n\nThe cell door sprung open and the three guards carefully stepped inside. Nishi quickly got to his feet, still suspicious of what seemed like something too good to be true.\n\n"And what might that be?"\n\nThe first guard stepped forward, bowed and presented Nishi with a pistol. The second one also bowed, but he presented the Colonel with his own sword, retrieved from the armour of the nearby garrison. Nishi felt that he could now trust these men.\n\n"There's a car waiting for you at the back of the prison, sir. We'll escort you there, but after that, we can't go further."\n\nNishi took both the pistol and the sword before he saluted the three guards.\n\n"Let's go.

The Colonel had decided to stop by here for a few minutes before going into hiding for some time.\n\nHis house had been somewhat wrecked in the scuffle during his arrest, but most of his possessions were still here. He packed a few valuables into a large bag, before Nishi realised he had yet to check the stables. Leaving the bag on his bed, he quickly headed out into the garden. To the Colonel's great relief, Jupiter was still in his box, happily munching away on a pile of hay. Nishi gave him a hug around the neck, and then realised that he would have to leave his prize horse behind.\n\nThat was of course only true if Nishi was to go into hiding. As he looked at Jupiter, the colonel had a thought. There was one more way he could be saved from execution. If he could make an appeal directly to the Emperor, then the charges would no longer matter. There was of course a risk that the Emperor would not hear his plea or that he would be shot before he could make it to the Imperial Palace. The car would get him there, but why would he use such a meaningless vehicle? There was only one way Nishi was going to do this.\n\nThe Colonel gathered the reins and saddle from the stable and attached them to Jupiter. If he was to die, or be pardoned, Nishi would go to his fate in his own way. He would let all of Tokyo know that he was a man of conviction and courage.

When a squad of police cars headed after him, the people of Tokyo only grew more amazed and bewildered.\n\nNishi had not met much trouble on his journey until he reached the city center. The Police presence was greatly heightened there; a result of the protests. The element of surprise had favoured Nishi though. He was able to ride along the sidewalks and alleyways, providing momentary respite from the police cars. His path was still a chaotic one; Jupiter came close to trampling several bystanders along the way. Nishi would disappear down one street and then repeear moments later; always way ahead of his pursuers. Attempts at erecting barricades were soon found to be pointless too. After all, what waist-high obstacle could stop a showjumping horse?\n\nAs Nishi reached the Imperial Palace gardens, his plan became clear to the police. Pursuit through into the park was impossible for the cars; their only hope was that the Imperial Guard could stop him. Said guards had orders to kill anyone who attempted to break into the palace. However, the sight of Colonel Nishi charging straight at them on horseback was enough to freeze them in their tracks. In the end, it was the gate to the palace that stopped Nishi. He dismounted Jupiter, before letting the horse go and began to climb the gate to the Imperial Palace."

The charges that I stood accused of were naught but hyperbole and slander. I defended myself as a man of honor, who wishes nothing more than to serve the Emperor and his Empire.

Although this was done swiftly, several civilians had witnessed the shooting from across the river.\n\nNishi's death quickly became a rallying-cry for the anti-militarist cause. A beloved officer was now dead; all due to the military's corruption and overreaching power. The very facts of death added fuel to the fire too. The guards responsible for the shooting became the living images of the rash soldier; overconfident and over empowered.\n\nAs protests continued across the major cities of Japan, the usual placards and banners were joined by images of Colonel Nishi. Some were paired with messages: "When will the madness stop?" and "He will not be forgotten" were common. Indeed, who could forget a man who only sought to achieve redemption in his final hours?"

They were divided into two groups; veterans, who set up small encampments outside of the Diet building to demand the full force of the law to fall on Nishi, and pacifists, who urged the government intervene to diffuse the situation entirely with a full pardon. \n\nThe intense heat spread a hysteria between the two crowds heckling from either side of the street. Both sides waved placards, yelled accusations, and threw small fragments of debris across the road at their opposition. Enraged and impassioned by the crowds, a student broke from the front-lines of the pacifists' crowd and charged to skirmish with a band of particularly aggressive veterans, and a great swarm was compelled to follow him. A great roar erupted from the street, followed soon after by the chatter and collision of makeshift batons, shields, and other equipment fashioned as weapons to fight the opposition. \n\nGreat crowds of people clashed in small groups throughout the street, tumbling on the floor and tussling with each other against brick walls and metal debris. The stench of violence grew thick in the warm sun, and brutality became a common sight between the groups. Eventually, law enforcement had arrived in heavily-armed droves to diffuse the chaos, but even their sirens and loud-speakers could not prize many off of barbarically mauling and attacking their countrymen in the streets of the capital."

This is something not worthy of our nation, nor it is deemed acceptable in the eyes of this eternal throne.

Despite the chaos of the present situation, out of it a Japan reborn could awaken from the ashes. Everything and... everyone who had led Japan down this path would receive justice, he repeated to himself.\n\nThe knob of the door creaked. Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda rotated his neck to face the visitor, and out the shadows emerged the Devil of Showa himself. He brought with him a tension, a lingering spectre of distraught. Behind Takeda's mask of emotionless formality, he likened the face of Nobusuke Kishi to the corpse of a biological experiment he had witnessed during the Greater East Asian War. Despite his looks, Kishi would be the one to force Japan through rebirth, no matter the blood and screaming it would take. Kishi shambled into his seat, at the other end of the glass table. Prince Takeda would be the first to strike up their planned topic of conversation.\n\n"I expect, Nobusuke Kishi, we may begin to discuss the 'emergency contingency plan' you mentioned to me at the beginning of this... affair. This 'plan,' which shall serve as our method to save Japan from that which ails it. I would be very interested to hear of your proposal, perhaps we can formulate a plan of action if the time comes for such an operation."\n\nKishi clenched the upholstered arms of the chair upon which he sat. "There will be no more waiting, Prince Takeda. The time for our plan of action is now, we simply must formulate our methodology and put it to practice.

You may be learning, or already know, that such deployments were conducted and carried out in my name, by my order. There are several reasons for the actions taken, let me assure you.\n\nFirstly, all divisions deployed were recently trained, fresh from recruitment. I am concerned over their wellbeing, as the current military situation of Japan has been tumultuous over the past few months, to say the least. They will be, in some form or another, safe in their positions, until they may be moved back. That said, I also hold concerns over the loyalty of these divisions. In the course of the past few months, the roots of anti-Japanese corruption have been uncovered in our military apparatus. The allegiance of these divisions to our nation has been found to be questionable, and so they may remain on the peripheries until all is said and done and troops may again be screened for their behavior and loyalty.\n\nI would also like to put forward a humble suggestion, to you our esteemed Home Minister. Akira Muto, a veteran commander and organizer, has proven to me personally his abilities in the realm of defense, especially concerning internal security operations. In times such as these, I suggest granting to Akira Muto the position of head of the Imperial General Headquarters. Included with this letter is a roll of microfilm. On this microfilm is data, and knowledge, attesting to certain unseemly truths within the current administration. For the sake of the nation, appoint Akira Muto and nothing will have to happen concerning the information included. Thank you, Home Minister.\n\nRegards, Nobusuke Kishi""

A kindly, old paternalistic figure, with the appearance of a grandpa welcoming his children to a family feast, sat with them.

Behind his calm, soothing aura and his grin was a man of bloodlust. You would not expect such a man to have taken part in the worst 'excesses' of the Nanjing Incident, during the Greater East Asian War. Indeed, he remembered it well, the blood-curdling screams and the piles upon piles of massacred corpses which littered the roads. A man of normal, well-adjusted temperament would be disgusted by the actions of the soldiers in Nanjing, but not Muto. No, Muto took it to heart, and adopted such policies for use in internal peacekeeping operations throughout the rest of the war. From China to the Philippines, though they may not have known his name, it was Muto butchering his way through East Asia.\n\n"So..." Kishi coughed up, "We have all come here to fulfill the aspects of our 'emergency contingency plan' which necessitate connections to our separate spheres of influence. I will build up pressure within the bureaucracy, and through use of my political allies, the underbelly of government will be prepared for what is to come. Prince Takeda, you are to use your connections in the Imperial Family, so that they do not revolt upon the initiation of our plan of action. Muto, this should be obvious, but we need you to corral and rile the military. The military will be the core centerpiece of our plan of action.

The first... Deputy Prime Minister. Oh... that wouldn't do. In these chaotic times, Japan did not need further division of its commanding power. Kishi assured himself, he could fulfill whatever duties were necessitated by both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister positions. He scrawled out the position of Deputy Prime Minister, the ink blotching and ultimately overtaking the writing.\n\nNext on to what was ultimately the most important position up for consideration. The Home Minister, who would be overseeing Japan's defense and security, both internal and external. The internal security aspect of this all was especially important. He needed someone who would, without question or hesitation, eliminate the opponents of Japan's rebirth. Perhaps, even make them suffer, so as to dissuade the fearful dissident from taking action. This was a simple choice, he would take up the position of Home Minister. Who else was more capable? Wait... no. He had promises to fulfill, and people to please. Akira Muto would be Defense Minister. If anybody could kill and kill again, it was Muto.\n\nAlright, onto the Minister of Finance. Perhaps... he could fulfill this position? It was only right for a commander to have in-roads into his own cabinet. Besides, he knew what Japan needed economically, technocratic centralization was practically Reform Bureaucrat manifesto. N-no... that wasn't how in-roads worked. He needed a man on the inside. Thinking back, how about Shiina Etsusaburo? He had been a close colleague and ally in Manchukuo. He just had to call him back and he could have the best toady a man could ask for, and a Reform Bureaucrat too.\n\nWhat next? Ah, yes, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In regular circumstances this would be his own cabinet position, but there were always powerful men to make happy, and Prince Takeda was soon to be a very powerful man. He could have it, for all he cared. Now... the skeleton of government was organized. Kishi pulled out, from underneath his desk, a bundle of papers. The real work was about to begin."

He had known all these men for decades. Allies, rivals, firebrands and schemers, he had been through it all with them. After those decades of politicking, he had come to a singular truth, a truth which now clogged his throat and strangled his thoughts. For every single one of them, he felt an insurmountable inferno of raw, seething hatred. They were all useless, or counteractive. Pompous, or rowdy. He despised every moment he was forced to play along to the Diet's newest game, for it was always a game. The nation, the people, the Dai Tōa Kyōei Ken, the Imperial Family. All were chips to gamble away for the sake of their personal ambitions. Let them know, this will be the final gamble.\n\nKishi brought forward his inkpen, and with it he blotched out the eyes of Sokichi Takagi, Koichi Kido, and Fumimaro Konoe. The rest of the Diet were malleable, and weak. They would bow to him, he just had to assert pressure in the correct locations. These three... fucking traitors would not bend and he knew it. From their entrance into Japan's political scene, each have done nothing but destroy everything they touch. Takagi champions his obliteration of the nation. Kido corrupts us all behind the curtain of the blood court. Konoe is nothing but a blind and stubborn fuck-up. For Japan to have a future, these men have to have their's ripped from them.\n\nKishi did not stop at these men's eyes. The ink blotched and soaked, but it wasn't enough.

The intense beam of the tactical lights illuminated the room, but the blinding beams did not even make Takagi flinch. Rather, he turned to them and looked them up and down, before swiveling his head back to pay attention to the darkened sky.\n\n"I know why you're here," he uttered calmly after an officer yelled his name, throwing a glass across the room to intimidate him, "I know that I can't stop this, either."\n\nThe soldiers, in awe of Takagi's stoic tranquility, were paralyzed where they stood and unable to act on their orders. They glimpsed back at a commanding officer for approval, though he himself had a look of concern smeared over his face.\n\n"Gentlemen, I will do you the honors, if you would let me. Pass me the blade, and I will die without bringing shame upon this family."\n\nAfter a few moments, Takagi looked to the officer from across the room with a cool expression; he welcomed death, but his request for the tanto knife fell on deaf ears. A bullet shot through Takagi's head, spewing blood across the cream-white walls of the room as his body collapsed to its side.

Kido was used to chaos, he had mastered it. Bouncing off of different factions and figures and scandals, he had become numb to it all. This chaos was different, however. This chaos was destructive, in a way he had never known before. Not only that, but he couldn't wipe the thought from his mind that something, some pale spectre, was orchestrating it all. Had someone beat him at his own game...?\n\nOut of Kido's ethereal dream of calm, a figure emerged. Kido, stone-faced and soft-spoken, prepared himself for a dialogue, as had been usual for the past three decades of politicking. As he opened his mouth...\n\nA world turned upside down. A bullet ripped through his stomach, spraying blood and viscera onto Kido's meditation mat. Kido, trembling, collapsed against the wall at his back. In an instant, the fog and euphoria dissipated, and so Kido awoke to his nightmare. The edges of his vision darkened with his fading cognition. All that remained to him was fury.\n\nAs the figure lumbered forward, aiming his pistol towards Kido's forehead, rage and rancor was all that Kido could summon to mind. So... many... years of laborious work, forging alliances and breaking down his political opponents. It was all for... nothing. And what was his reward for his works? To be killed with a pistol.

But only the abyss was present to answer his knocking.\n\nHe smashed his hand against the wall of the entryway, cluelessly searching for anything resembling a light switch. Just gotta... there we go.

The IJA had a new master, Kishi Nobusuke, and he was adamant in securing the home isles as promptly as possible in time for his appointment as Prime Minister.

The crackle of gunfire bounced throughout the city and the great thuds of artillery shook besieged government buildings as citizens fled in fear. Families cowered in their homes as others caught in the streets were shepherded into tents, makeshift cover, or simply lined up and executed on the orders of particularly cruel commanding officers.

The Members knew what they were witnessing: a hush-hush coup d'état. This was no outcry of the nation's bureaucratic underbelly, but a concerted effort to overthrow the government. There was no one left to save them, all soldiers not in line with Kishi had been sent off to the outer rims of the Dai Tōa Kyōei Ken. Hope was lost, but resistance remained in those with the will to fight. Kishi had not expected it, but they would fight.\n\nThey roared onto the ground floor of the House of Representatives, wielding high-tech weaponry and a blank check for all blood shed. A sea of grey and black helmets, the blood-red rays of the rising sun coating their arms, helmets and chest plates. Seizure. The Members responded with force, running onto the speaking platform of the lower house to push back the wall of soldiers. First came the batons and canes, a frothing wave of flesh meeting metal. The members were repulsed, bruises and blinded eyes their gifts of return. The resistance had not yet died, Japan was not yet lost. A gang of those most libertarian or reformist Members, headed by the up and coming Yasuhiro Nakasone, made a final, desperate push against Kishi's men. They were making progress, taking back the speaking platform, but then... the guns arrived. As Nakasone pushed back the last soldier off the speaking platform, a military grade shotgun was shoved up and against his stomach, and then came the waterfall. Nakasone collapsed, a torrent of blood streaming from out his chest. The soldiers returned to the speaking platform, trampling over Nakasone's corpse and shooting into the rest of those who dared oppose them.

Ideas that would see a generation of Japanese children lost to war, ideas that would see the peoples of all Asia die suffocating from smokestacks and the chemicals of war.
