 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_Theodor_Hoffmann_DESC:0 "Theodor Hoffman has reached the summit of his climb up the Kriegsmarine. Power everlasting and status, like nothing his peers and predecessors could ever dream of. Yet Theodor Hoffman - commander of the most powerful fleet in human history - looks to the murky, orange horizon, over the Black Sea, with nothing but dread and loathing. Karl Donitz is gone, the Fatherland lies shattered - a prisoner of its brutality - and Crimea stands as a lonely bastion of German civilisation. For Hoffman, the monkey's paw has curled.\n\nTheodor Hoffman was born in 1935 to modest circumstances. In 1952, Hoffman began his affair with the ocean as part of the maritime police. The young policeman became the young Admiral, all too quickly. It was during his studies that he would meet the legendary "Seewolf'' Karl Donitz. Not content to become a second-rate captain, Hoffman forged a vital friendship with Donitz, something that would serve him increasingly well. Soon after his diploma from the Kiel Naval Academy, the job as the Kriegsmarine second-in-command was his.\n\nThe winds have changed. With Heydrich's victory - and the deathmatch against Himmler - Karl Donitz reluctantly returned to Germania to assist Heydrich. In his place, Theodor Hoffman stands. The savage slaughter that enveloped Eastern Europe has not spread to Crimea. Yet. The waves of time are as unpredictable as the ones in the North Sea, and death is only one slight mistake away.\n\nCrimea stands alone, the frothing waves of insanity dashing themselves against the seawalls. But for how long?"
