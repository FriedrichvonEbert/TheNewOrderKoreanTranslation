 #GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS#
 ITA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Italy's recent history is one strung with an impressive sequence of victories and defeats. The minor partner in the European Axis, Italy entered the war playing second fiddle to Germany and performing disastrously in the Balkans - only to win an incredible victory in Egypt. Italy soon found itself ruling over an overstretched empire and a divided nation, the country surviving the disaster of Atlantropa only to its newly acquired immense oil reserves. Under the guidance of Ciano, fascism seems to be fading away, but even that could be an illusion - and many in the country fear that Italy may fall from the ranks of the world powers just as quickly as it rose them."
 IEA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Italian East Africa wasn't the first conquest of the Italian Empire, but surely it is its proudest one. From the great heights of the Ethiopian mountains to the palm tree lined shores of Somalia, East Africa is home to endless fields of grain, unfathomable veins of gold and other minerals, loyal and hard-working natives, and just and honorable administrators. At least, that is the image constantly conveyed by Italian media and propaganda. In truth, East Africa is barely functioning despite the decent stewardship of its Viceroy, Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta. Rebels and partisans still haunt the territory's mountains and forests, and despite its vast riches, its economy struggles to develop in a mire of corruption. The crown jewel of the Italian Empire is starting to crack, and many believe that Italy will have to let go of its most precious conquest - either willingly or not..."
 IME_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "When the Italian Empire expanded at a breakneck pace during World War Two, few among the fascist leadership stopped to consider the fact that some of the newly conquered territories would have been more trouble than they were worth. In the Levant, Italian rule was constantly marked by fierce resistance by native Arabs, and the plans to counterbalance them with Jewish immigrants backfired as Zionist groups took up arms against Italy as well. Dalla Chiesa, the new young Governor, adopted a new strategy - attempting to negotiate with moderate of both camps, which fostered an uneasy peace between the Italians, Haganah and Fatah. The threat of Turkey looms on the horizon, and it might be the only thing capable of uniting the peoples of the Levant, or to once and for all doom the region to chaos."
 EGY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Egypt's days as the center of global civilization are long, long over, but King Farouk I knows that to be successful you have to look successful, and what looks more like success than fast cars and cans of caviar? Whether his nation can afford to subsidize his... tastes... in the long term is debatable, but so long as the taxes are paid and the grain shipped, Egypt's Italian masters don't much mind its king's extravagance. Unfortunately, there are many who oppose the king's rule, either in the name of revolutionary fervour or reactionary fanaticism - but both are more than willing to take advantage of a ruler who much prefers cavorting and carriages to actual leadership. When the festivities reach their conclusion and the sun rises on the gilded ruins, will you have the strength and discipline to help Egypt navigate the next decade into true prosperity?"
 IRQ_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Iraq is a curious case among the motley despots and colonialists within the Italian sphere. As the Italian attempt to integrate it as a puppet state of the empire failed miserably after a revolution, Rome was forced to accept Baghdad's autonomy, and Iraq is now one of the few truly democratic states in the Middle East, at least nominally. It operates as an authoritarian democracy, in which every willing political party under the sun is allowed a foot in the government so long as they don't challenge Italian control over the nation's oil, or the political dominance of Abd al-Karim Qasim and the National Democratic Party. But the system is a house of cards, with schemers, conspirators and plotters from every direction threatening Iraq and its leader. If (or when) it all comes tumbling down, who will rise from the ashes?"
 ILG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Italian Empire is, for the most part, a scrupulously legal entity. While the Nazis simply take what they want, Italy's lands were obtained honorably, after the surrender of a foe. That is, except for Algeria. It began as a few settlers looking for new homes in what was de-jure part of the crumbling French State - the Empire's wild west, far away from the eye of Rome. When Italy's supposed ally, Iberia, began to expand her influence over the region, it was tribal bribery and armed incursions. Now Italian Algeria is controlled by a tentative military administration, which has grown more and more reliant on a shaky alliance with Algerian natives. Naturally, tensions are high with the Iberians and their allies, the pied-noir militias. As the Triumvirate folds into itself, which empire, if any, will rule Algeria, and how much will be left for them to rule?"
 CRO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "From its inception, the Independent State of Croatia was a farce. An Axis puppet government borne out of World War Two and theoretically a monarchy led by an Italian king, it was practically in the hands of Ante Pavelić and his brutal Ustaše. With the collapse of the Axis and the death of Pavelić, the Italian empire reaffirmed its control over Croatia - ousting the Ustaše and placing the kingdom in the hands of a small cadre of Italian generals and advisors. With partisan activity still rampant in the country and the Ustaše now operating underground, the kingdom appears to be on its last legs - change is coming to the country, for good or for worse..."
 GRE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Hellenic State was born in the fires of World War Two, and even in this new age, it still suffers from the same problems it had when Europe was engulfed by conflict. A deeply unpopular and undemocratic government, the recent history of Greece is characterized by a consistent failure to reform or liberalize the country in any way, as the state is kept together only by the heavy presence of Triumvirate garrisons to keep the numerous partisan groups and organizations in check. However, with the Prime Minister's health ailing, a crisis seems to be inevitable - and the cradle of European civilization might soon be engulfed by war once more. Will Greece manage to resurrect from her ashes as a phoenix, or is the country doomed to more decades of darkness?"
 SAU_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "From humble beginnings, the house of al-Saud became one of the dominant powers of the entire Arabian peninsula - and when World War Two changed everything, in Arabia everything stayed the same. With meetings and handshakes, the Saudi royalty kept its independence under the wings of the Italian empire - becoming the only nation in the Italian sphere not to host a garrison from Rome, all in exchange for easy access to oil. Thanks to oil deals with Italy, the Saudi house became fabulously rich, and they fully intend to put their wealth to good use. As many in the Arab and Islamic world look to Riyadh as a beacon for Muslim opposition to western imperialism, the Saudis silently bid their time, waiting for the right moment to lead the fight against the Italian oppressors, and to finally achieve their true calling as the leaders of the faithful."

 #LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
 POLITICS_CIANO_DESC:0 "Gian Galeazzo Ciano, 2nd Count of Cortellazzo and Buccari, son-in-law of Benito Mussolini, and Duce of Italy, began his career as a bomber squadron commander during the invasion of Ethiopia, winning two silver medals of valor and returning home a hero. In Ethiopia, he learned valuable lessons about people and leading, lessons which have given him the ability to bring Italy to greatness. After the war ended, Mussolini chose Ciano to be his foreign minister, preparing him to be his successor by giving him valuable political experience. As foreign minister, Ciano presided over Italian affairs on the world stage, helping her expand during and before the Second World War through both peaceful and violent means. Throughout the entire war, he managed to keep the Germans from dominating over Italy, fighting tooth and nail to keep his country as an equal partner with the Reich. And when the time came for peace, Ciano fought even further for the concessions that Italy required to make an empire that spanned multiple continents. Post-1948, Ciano retained his position as foreign minister and became much closer with his father-in-law. Knowing his time was near, Mussolini taught him everything he knew about leading, and when the Duce passed away, Ciano took up the reins. As the leader of Italy, Ciano has chosen to take a softer approach to ruling, dreaming of liberalizing the fascist state and returning rights to the people while working with his neighbors rather than fighting them. The path before him is treacherous, and only through gile and skill will Ciano manage to keep Italy afloat in this turbulent world."

#2nd Verona Congress Scorza#

ita_the_second_verona_congress_new:0 "The Second Verona Congress"
ita_the_second_verona_congress_new_desc:0 "The new Duce barely took office after the removal of Ciano, and already trouble is brewing within his own party. Enthused by the winds of change within the PNF, several high profile representatives of important organizations of the party have decided to call a Second Congress in Verona, convinced that Scorza will be glad to participate. Their goal is to set out a program of reforms and measures aimed at reviving the spark of the fascist revolution of 1922, now that the reactionaries and liberals rallying around Ciano have been ousted from their previous position of dominance. However, the Duce is yet to issue an official statement on this Second Congress, and according to some this might be a thinly veiled power play by members of the PNF who wish to subdue Scorza into obedience. The first challenge of Scorza as Duce will be to either allow the Congress, or to shut it down."
ita_approve_the_congress:0 "Approve the Congress"
ita_approve_the_congress_desc:0 "Carlo Scorza, Duce of Fascism, has released a statement to the press, saying that the Second Congress of Verona shall take place with his blessing, and that he himself will attend it and take the floor to address the important themes discussed there. Attending the Congress means showing good will towards reformists within the PNF, but most of all demonstrates the willingness of the new Duce to listen to his own party rather than concentrate decisional power into his own hands. However, it is hard to predict how the Duce will actually deal with the PNF, once at the Congress."
ita_shut_down_the_congress:0 "Shut Down the Congress"
ita_shut_down_the_congress_desc:0 "The Second Verona Congress is, at best, a threatening development, and at worst, an act of treason. If the situation isn't dealt with immediately, Scorza's rule might be tarnished by an undisciplined PNF who starts to act independently of his own Duce - and we all know how it ended the last time that happened. For the sake of the nation's and the regime's stability and security, Scorza has decided to move against the Congress, declaring it unlawful, and urging the participants to leave the premises immediately and orderly. This likely won't be taken kindly by the numerous supporters of the Congress who have gathered in Verona, but it's a necessary act to reaffirm Scorza's rule."
ita_promises_of_reform_2019:0 "Promises of Reform"
ita_promises_of_reform_2019_desc:0 "Despite the victory in the Second World War, many fascists within the PNF started to feel that fascism was failing to deliver what it had promised during its early days. Even worse, during the reign of Ciano, the fascist flame was at risk of being snuffed out, perhaps once and for all. However, with our newfound predominance in the Mediterranean, we can now fully reform the Italian society according to the ideals and visions of the fascist revolution. By returning to the roots of the fascist ideology, Scorza promises a sweeping transformation of the PNF, and of Italy itself."
ita_remind_them_their_duties:0 "Remind Them of Their Duties"
ita_remind_them_their_duties_desc:0 "The Task of Fascism Is Simple - to grant Italy the greatness it deserves. For this reason, what most matters in this moment is further solidifying the PNF's hold over the country. To do this however, it is of the utmost importance that all members of the party are strong in their faith to Scorza, for the will of the Duce is the will of the party, and of Italy. Therefore, all fascists in Italy must be reminded that now that the traitor Ciano has been ousted from a position he wrongfully occupied, their obedience and loyalty goes to the true Duce of Fascism, Carlo Scorza. Disobeying an order from the Duce is tantamount to betrayal to the fascist ideal - thus, reforms and changes will happen if and when the Duce decides it."
ita_PNF_stays_PNF:0 "What Happens In The PNF Stays In The PNF"
ita_PNF_stays_PNF_desc:0 "While our decision to shut down the Congress has caused quite a commotion, there is no need to escalate conflict. If we keep this as an internal matter of the PNF, the situation can be resolved with little further chaos and risk of violence than if we get the other government organizations involved. Scorza has urged the high profile PNF representatives in Verona to stand down or see their status within the party threatened - at the same time, all party members who will take part in demonstrations in Verona will see their party membership suspended or revoked. Hopefully, this relatively light conduct will convince the people in Verona that the Duce is open to dialogue, even if only under his own terms."
ita_national_emergency_time:0 "A Matter of National Emergency"
ita_national_emergency_time_desc:0 "The current happenings in Verona aren't just a problem for the Duce or the PNF to deal with, but a serious threat to the stability of Italy, and therefore, a threat to all Italians. For this reason, the Duce has pressured King Umberto II into declaring a status of national emergency, for the city of Verona is currently occupied by a gang of subversives and rabble rousers who wish to remove Scorza from power as part of their petty intrigues. With this move, Scorza will most of all send a message to all dissidents in his own party - that the Duce won't stop at anything to ensure that his dominion over the party is unchallenged."
ita_back_to_san_sepolcro:0 "Back to San Sepolcro"
ita_back_to_san_sepolcro_desc:0 "The very first fascist party in Italy was the Italian Fasci of Combat, founded by Benito Mussolini on the 23rd of March, 1919, at San Sepolcro Square in Milan. This new party was a wind of true revolutionary change in the midst of an Italy suffocated by liberalism and threatened by the communist spectre. In that square, the first spark of the fascist revolution shone - we must return to that spark, to that revolutionary fervor that burned in the hearts of WWI veterans, of revolutionary syndicalists, of nationalists and of all those who wanted to see Italy and the Italian people achieve the greatness they deserved. Today marks the beginning of a new fascist revolution, for we shall return to that spark, and turn it into a great flame."
ita_controllable_reforms:0 "Controllable Reform"
ita_controllable_reforms_desc:0 "While the fascist political edifice is the strongest and most adequate that Italy has ever seen, it could admittedly use some renovations. Cobwebs and dust will accumulate even in the halls of grand palaces if they're poorly kept, and under Ciano the PNF and the other fascist institutions have stagnated. For this reason, Scorza has promised to enact a series of measures to make sure that the all the fascist organizations, from the PNF to the MVSN, from the fascist syndicates to the GIL and the ONB, are brought back to their former glory and efficiency, all under the watchful eyes of himself, the Duce of Fascism."
ita_the_ghost_of_mussolini:0 "The Ghost of Mussolini"
ita_the_ghost_of_mussolini_desc:0 "Asserting that the fascist system needs reforms implies that it's perfectible - but the fact that it's perfectible implies that it's imperfect. As it should be evident to all sensible fascists, suggesting that the fascist system is imperfect is very close to ideological treason. All this talk of change, even when spoken by well meaning fascists, is a crack in the edifice through which treason, deceit and intrigue might easily slip in. Shouldn't we instead took pride in what we already have achieved, instead of always striving to make changes that might pervert the fascist ideals? Shouldn't we be proud of our Mare Nostrum, of the greatness of Mussolini, and now of the greatness of Scorza, who is all but a second Mussolini?"
ita_we_can_talk_this_out:0 "We Can Talk This Out"
ita_we_can_talk_this_out_desc:0 "The situation in Verona might be serious, but it is not yet hopeless. The Duce has insisted that the Congress will be disbanded, but that violence will only be used as a last resort, and that for the sake of the party and of Italy, he is willing to negotiate with all the representatives of the PNF who are in Verona. While negotiating from a position of strength, Scorza hopes to reaffirm his rule over the party without having to resort to violence - but it's possible that the people in Verona aren't willing to negotiate at all, taking the Duce's unwillingness to use force as a sign of weakness."
ita_surrounding_verona:0 "Surround Verona"
ita_surrounding_verona_desc:0 "While it's true that violence is best avoided, sometimes a little show of force is necessary to get one's point across. The Duce has ordered MVSN and public order units to move in strategic locations around the city of Verona, effectively putting the city under siege, blocking anyone from entering or leaving the central parts of the urban area. The Duce's goal is to make the people at the Congress feel trapped and defenseless, and if that is successful, there's no doubt that they will be much more willing to listen to our arguments, and actually stand down."
ita_storimg_verona:0 "Storm Verona"
ita_storimg_verona_desc:0 "Against such a blatant and open display of insubordination, or even worse treason, there can be only one answer - repression. After strong arming the king into giving him permission, the Duce has ordered MVSN and Regio Esercito units to take positions around Verona, mobilizing to retake the city by storm from those who unlawfully occupied it. This will undoubtedly lead to some resistance from the people at the Congress, but we're confident that the majority of them will simply surrender when faced with the prospect of an unwinnable battle - and when the dust settles, everyone will know exactly how Scorza deals with upstarts and rabble rousers."
ita_spirit_of_fiume:0 "The Spirit of Fiume"
ita_spirit_of_fiume_desc:0 "Even before the March of Rome and the founding of the PNF, an event which involved numerous soon to be fascists took place, in what was then a territory outside of Italy. The glorious saga of Fiume, where poet-warrior Gabriele D'Annunzio set up his state after taking the city by storm, with the eventual goal of integrating the city into Italy. The Carnaro Regency, D'Annunzio's state, was a masterwork of political engineering, and its constitution, the Charter of Carnaro, was the most forward-thinking and advanced set of laws that a nation could hope for at the time. Fiume is to us as a shining beacon, an example to follow, and we are the only ones who can realize D'Annunzio's ideals in the modern times."
ita_doctorine_of_fascism_2019:0 "The Doctrine of Fascism"
ita_doctorine_of_fascism_2019_desc:0 "According to Giovanni Gentile, the fascist ideology differs from all other political orientations because it is by far the most adaptive, and it changes with the times. Fascism lives to the beat of history, and for this reason it is foolish to believe that we can try to suddenly shape the culture, tradition, and spirit of the Italian nation to follow an ideological project. At the same time, we must recognize that the rise of fascism was fundamental to save Italy from the threat of communism which was emerging at the time, and also brought it to newfound greatness over the decades. Fascism is a historical project that, like any project, changes with the times, and we too shall make our changes, but without disrespecting our past."
ita_loyalty_to_the_duce:0 "Loyalty to the Duce"
ita_loyalty_to_the_duce_desc:0 "Fascism as an ideology is defined by a single factor - fanatical loyalty to the leader. All the rest is secondary, as fascism cannot be separated from the figure of the Duce, who should at all times occupy the minds and hearts of any fascist worthy of this adjective. Contradicting the Duce is equal to treason - disobeying the Duce is identical to high treason. All those in Verona will be reminded of these truths, so that they do not get the idea that just as Scorza was put in place after his predecessor was ousted, that means that the same can happen to the current Duce. Obedience, devotion, and loyalty - anyone who does not possess these three qualities is an enemy of the State and of the Duce."
ita_send_the_carabinieri:0 "Send the Carabinieri"
ita_send_the_carabinieri_desc:0 "While the situation in Verona seems to have at least partially defused, some of the more violent and rowdy protestors are still a source of worry. For this reason, Scorza has ordered the Carabinieri to move into Verona and make sure that the ruckus is kept to a minimum - they have orders to arrest the troublemakers, make sure nobody gets too hurt, and use tear gas and fire hydrants to disperse riots and large crowds, only using live ammunition if strictly necessary. Hopefully, and with a bit of luck, the worst is over, and the situation will be under complete control soon."
ita_send_in_the_blackshirts_2019:0 "Send the Blackshirts"
ita_send_in_the_blackshirts_2019_desc:0 "The Duce, in his wisdom, has decided that the best way to deal with the situation in Verona is to unleash the MVSN, the most well known fascist paramilitary, also known as Blackshirts. Their orders are to restore public order in Verona and make sure any act of insubordination is dealt with, without hesitating to use violence if the situation calls for it. The Blackshirts are notoriously somewhat rowdy, and it's likely that there will be at least some small scale urban warfare, but sending in the MVSN is first and foremost equal to broadcasting a political message - that the people in Verona are betraying the fascist cause, and the most appropriate way to remind them of that is sending the fascist militia after them."
ita_send_in_the_big_ol_army:0 "Send the Army"
ita_send_in_the_big_ol_army_desc:0 "Carlo Scorza has ordered that the time has come to make an example out of the would be subversives currently squatting in Verona. Generals of the Regio Esercito were given orders to enter Verona in full force (including tanks and helicopters), remove all threats to public order, and not hesitate to use lethal violence whenever they feel it is necessary. Urban warfare will be almost inevitable, as will be collateral damage to civilians and property, but this is exactly the kind of message the Duce has decided to send the nation. By giving the people of the Congress a thorough thrashing, Scorza will make sure that anyone will think twice before ever challenging his rule again."

Once again, their voices are heard, and once again, a new generation of fascists seems to be ready to carry on their legacy, with Scorza at the helm - only time will tell if they will manage to live up to this promise."

The voice of Carlo Scorza, the new Duce of Italy, who has now made it clear that he does not intend to follow the path of his predecessor, and who has already shown that his hold on the PNF is indeed solid. The liberals and reformists within the party have been swayed to his side or turned to silence, and from a high balcony in Verona, the new Duce is announcing to Italy and to the world that his reign has begun, and will not end anytime soon."

Without much ado, and with only small scale violence, the people at the Congress have either been arrested or left the premises; the PNF representatives who were behind the whole organization have either been silenced or convinced to never challenging the Duce again; and above it all stands the new Duce. Carlo Scorza has now solidified his rule over the party, removing or silencing reformists and dissenters - this will undoubtedly strengthen the PNF in the future, as well as Scorza's own rule."

The consequences of defying the Duce are shown for all to see in Verona - with most of those who were present at the Congress now filling the city's morgues, hospitals and prisons. The PNF representatives at the Congress are already starting to be trialed and purged one by one for treason, and it seems that from now on Scorza will have an almost total control over his party."

While numerous prominent early fascists belonged to the female gender and the early fascist movement asked for more rights for women in their programs, the praxis of the fascist government after 1922 told a different story, as women were systematically discriminated upon in jobs, governmental positions, and even education. However, this didn't stop Italian women in the fascist camp, especially among the youth, from demanding more rights and equality - they hope that Scorza's seizure of power might bring about change to the female condition in Italy, but many voices within the party, especially in the conservative and traditionalist wings of the PNF, have expressed worry at these sentiments."

As our regime is still new and strongly entrenched, we can expect little pushback from the bureaucrats themselves if we were to remove or redefine some regulations to allow for some flexibility.

They represent a considerable power bloc within the state that can actually challenge the state itself on matters of power and authority, and that represents a problem. We need to find a way to break up that power without antagonizing the workers too much.\n\nWhile outright outlawing the unions and stripping them of their ability to collectively negotiate is a non-starter, we can choose to instead, break up the unions and let smaller, more localized unions take their place. They'll still have their representation, but not so much that we can't keep them under control."

If we can continue making overtures to the working class, we will only grow all the stronger for it.\n\nPublicly endorsing the unions, showing our support for them and being seen among them will do a lot for our public image. It will give us opportunities to enact more comprehensive measures without losing their faith in the future. A pragmatic but benevolent appearance will pay back dividends in the future, so we should move to embrace it as entirely as possible."

We'd be foolish to not take advantage of this fact like the powers that be have so far. \n\nThrough our efforts, we have successfully managed to concentrate near total economic power into a handful of capable and trustworthy cartels.

After our previous affirmations to the Unions, this will seem as something akin to a betrayal, but in order to balance the interest of the unions against the rest of the nation, it is necessary."

We stand ready to present the culmination of the Fascist project, and be aware, all eyes are on us while we do so. "

They found that the reforms, in their words, were "more imaginary and real", and seemed designed to "satiate the Italian public rather than to affect real change". Though the advisors were dismissed in a huff, they weren't wrong. In the early stages of the Italian spring, Ciano and his underlings had to proceed with the purest caution, lest they tread on the wrong toes and send their nation spiraling into chaos. Now, though, the future seems far more assured. The Fascist Party was won over at Verona, the people have chosen Ciano's vision of the future over the sad nostalgia of Scorza, the inept hallucinations of Curcio, or the madness of Farinacci. From now on, the reforms will proceed, and the true potential of the Italian eagle will be unleashed."

Our long term goal is to liberalize the daily lives of the Italian people, democracy is useless if we can't convince the population that things are truly about to change, and if we don't clarify that, we're simply going to end up with another dictatorship sooner rather than later."

Of course, if we are to reform into a democracy, we cannot maintain these laws. We must roll back these rules so that other parties can exist and have power in Italy. No longer will one need to be part of the PNF in order to keep a job or to run for office! We shall begin a campaign to make people not stigmatize those who don't join the PNF.

We will shift some of the MinCulPop's tasks to the much more efficient and transparent Ministry of National Education, which will be made into a intermediary between the government and the Italian cultural industry, while finally dissolving this relic of a bygone age once and for all, this is a fundamental step in liberalizing Italian culture and arts."

The obvious best solution is to burn the documents in secret, removing any trace of the info.

However, these old horrible times are over. A personality cult will not work well with our nascent democracy, as any party that comes into power will merely wish to restore the Duce to being the leader of Italy. Besides, despite what many may believe, Benito Mussolini was not a perfect man, and he in fact had many flaws. We must move to begin to show the truth of how the Duce is not a God amongst men, but a normal person who does in fact make mistakes. This probably will spark much outrage, especially from the hardliner fascists, but we shall be able to weather it, as Verona has shown that the hardliner ideas are not the true way forward for Italy."

He's regarded as a sort of savior, a hero for his people, who never did anything wrong. While it's nice for the people to have someone they can look up to, the aura of perfection built around Mussolini has made many people, especially in the uneducated underclasses, instinctively distrust the democratizing reforms of Ciano. If democracy is so great, then why did Mussolini remove it, they wonder. We must begin to instill the radical idea that perhaps Mussolini wasn't an infallible prophet, but just a human like everyone else, sure, a great leader that did everything he could do to make his country great, but still a human, and laws made by humans have to be changed when the times require it."

Yes, the Italian Army is nowhere near innocent and has done horrible things. Yes, the problems of the past decades are not solely attributable to Atlantropa and Germany, but to the government's incompetence as well.

For this reason, we will completely remove the King's power to intervene in Italian politics, then we shall reform the executive, by eliminating the Grand Council, and finally, we shall democratize Parliament, thus removing all vestiges of the fascist state in the Italian government.

This, for example, allowed Mussolini to simply change the Statute in order to legally turn Italy from a democratic state into a fascist one. However, many lawmakers and jurists in Italy have pointed out that many laws of the Statute imply that the King has large legal powers in the Italian government, and while historically the Crown has mostly stayed out of the political life (or more recently, was effectively a fancy rubber stamp for Mussolini), these parts of the Statute are a loaded gun pointed directly at our nascent democracy. A functioning democratic state simply can't run the risk of legally turning back into an authoritarian monarchy if King Umberto or one of his successors decide that they don't like the political state of our country, thus, we need to modify the Statute and add safeguards to make sure that the King of Italy can only play a ceremonial and symbolic role, without influencing the political life of our country."

It is imperative that such an organ is dissolved, and a new, democratically elected Chamber of Deputies is created, to be elected democratically. To put an additional safeguard for our democracy, we will create a regime of perfect bicameralism, meaning that the Chamber and the Senate will share the same responsibilities and the same level of powers, that way, governments will need a majority in both Houses to pass laws and change the Statute, making it significantly harder for single parties to dominate politics."

For starters, we shall remove the King's ability to appoint senators; secondly, we will make sure that current senators-for-life (those appointed by the King) have their status removed when the Senate is reformed after the election.

This, as we have sadly seen, is blatantly false. The various government departments whose leaders were chosen by this system have turned into money sinks to rival Africa Orientale Italiana! We need to remove these people chosen through this nepotism, and replace them with well educated leaders. We need to do this, however, in a slow and steady manner, as the hardliner fascist factions will say that Ciano is purging the Italian government of "true, hard-working Italians"! We can use the many complaints filed by superiors and inferiors of the uneducated leaders, that were ignored in the past.

All the rooms were packed, the seats were filled and journalists swarmed around the elegant Roman palaces where the fascist regime was officially about to end its own existence. Ciano delivered a very similar speech, all three times, he fondly remembered the days of Mussolini, spent a few somber words to remember the tragedies of the last World War, then spoke fiercely about his own role as Italy's Duce. He openly admitted that much of what he did was controversial, an abrupt change from the glorious recent past of Italy, tension was clearly hanging in the air as he outlined the sheer change that the PNF, the government and the very country had undergone in his years as Duce. But that tension was dissolved and erupted, all three times, into thundering applause as Ciano thanked his audience, and left the floor, for the last time.

The first of them to form was the Christian Democrats (or DC), led by Amintore Fanfani, a loose coalition of moderate conservatives, catholics and liberals who stress the importance of accelerating reforms to free up Italy's economy and society, their critics have pointed out, however, that their economic plan would probably spell disaster on Italy's underclasses. To the left, we have the Democratic Front (or FD), led by well known socialist Pietro Nenni, who has managed to take the reins of the leftist movement coalescing it into a single party, the FD mostly wish to liberalize the country's society, while creating a strong welfare state to make sure that Italy's poorest are cared for. The very existence of the PSDI has outraged the more radical conservatives and ex-fascists, who claim it to be a den of communists in disguise. Finally, the party which took the longest to form, to the right stand the National Blocs (or BN), a quite heterogeneous alliance of former moderate fascists (as the PNF formally dissolved to coalesce into the BN), monarchists, and radical conservatives, all gravitating around the charismatic former PNF secretary Giorgio Almirante, who seems poised to continue Ciano's status quo of slow-burn reforms. As the electoral race picks up more and more speed, we can only hope that, whoever gets elected, the formation of the next government will be a smooth and orderly process, without the ugly face of violent radicalism appearing again."

demitaly.9.t:0 "Ciano Speaks to the Gran Consiglio"
demitaly.9.d:0 "Today Ciano has taken the floor in Palazzo Venezia to address the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo, in a speech that was strictly kept secret from national media. As spoke, Ciano criticized Mussolini's tenure as Duce, underlining key aspects which "undermined the Italian state"; Ciano moved on to criticize several aspects of the current fascist state, and the necessity of them being immediately changed.\n\nThe Duce mentioned the cult of personality around his figure and that of his predecessors, the excessively authoritarian and repressive measures taken by fascism against political opponents, the lack of transparency and accountability in many fascist institutions, and the forced italianization of linguistic and cultural minorities. All these factors, according to Ciano, have "kept Italy from achieving its full potential as a free nation", and "must be addressed if we wish our nation to prosper into the future".\n\nThe speech was partially leaked to the press, and caused much discussion among both supporters and opposers of Ciano. At this point, the writing is clearly on the wall, and it is apparent that the Duce wants to at least partially dismantle the system that he's the leader of. International observers agree that this might be the beginning of the end for the fascist state, possibly leading to the dawn of a new, democratic era."

demitaly.11.d:0 "In a speech broadcasted through national radio, His Majesty King Umberto II di Savoia, King of Italy, Emperor of Ethiopia, First Marshal of the Empire, has spoken about the recent modifications of the Albertine Statute, Italy's constitutional law. In particular, the King gracefully accepted and welcomed the new limitations imposed by law on his person, and swore to comply with them in order to "follow the will of the Italian nation, which I serve".\n\nIn particular, the recent modifications, imposed by Ciano and agreed upon by King Umberto, remove the king's power to appoint ministers, to dissolve Parliament, and make it impossible for His Majesty to veto laws in Parliament. From now on, unless these new laws are changed again by Parliament, the King will effectively lose all political power in Italy, and continue existing as a mere figurehead.\n\nIt was already well known that Umberto II wasn't very engaged with the political matters of the Kingdom, and that he enjoyed mutual trust and friendship with Ciano; however, few would have speculated that the King would willingly renounce all political power for him and his descendants. Strangely, this news has been welcomed by both the left and the right wing, as many fascists still hold true to the original republican ideals of the PNF."

demitaly.12.t:0 "The End of the Gran Consiglio"
demitaly.12.d:0 "Today, Ciano has passed what might be his most controversial law, the one that would dissolve the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo, the most important executive body of the fascist regime. The Grand Council of Fascism won't be the only organism that will be dissolved, but with it the various fascist unions and syndicates, the MVSN, and several others, will be eliminated.\n\nThis is so far the most serious and decisive blow that Ciano has dealt to the fascist power structure, effectively striking at the heart of the fascist regime in the name of a renewed democracy. Of course, many conservative and pro-fascist representatives voiced harsh dissent, but the news were welcomed by large strata of Italian society which are largely in favor of Ciano's reforms.\n\nThe Grand Council will be replaced by a cabinet of ministers, appointed by a Prime Minister who will be in turn elected by Parliament. This is the first serious step towards the creation of a new democratic order in Italy, and the media speculate that it is only a matter of time before elections and full democratization come to the country."
demitaly.12.a:0 "It was about time"

demitaly.13.t:0 "Ciano Announces a Democratic Camera"
demitaly.13.d:0 "The Italian lower house, since 1939, has been represented by the Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni, a non-elected assembly made up of important representatives of the regime, in theory it was supposed to be the main organ of the fascist political edifice, but in practice it was filled by yesmen who did nothing more than put a rubber stamp on Mussolini's orders. Ciano has demanded the dissolution of the Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni, which will be replaced by a democratically elected Camera dei Deputati.\n\nThe new Camera will also function in tandem with the Senate in a regime of perfect bicameralism, this reforms was put in place by Ciano to ensure that in order to change laws any party must hold a majority in both the upper and the lower chamber of Parliament. It is clear that Ciano's goal isn't simply to dismantle fascism, but also to make sure that it doesn't come back any time soon.\n\nAs another key element of the fascist regime disappears from Italy, to be replaced by a democratic legislative body, some are already starting to get ready for the new elections. Many are still skeptical about Ciano's democratization of the country, but there's no denying that the Duce wants to see it through to the end."
demitaly.13.a:0 "Ciano is a determined man, it seems"

demitaly.14.t:0 "The Reset of the Senate"
demitaly.14.d:0 "The Senate, one of the few pre-fascist political organisms that was left mostly untouched by Mussolini's restructuring of Italian politics, is still however packed full by senators-for-life appointed by the former Duce, remarkably, just in 1939, 212 people were made senators from a decree signed by the King, who was strong-armed by Mussolini. Ciano has ordered that all senators-for-life will lose their status after the coming elections, thus ensuring a full "reset" of the Senate.\n\nNo exceptions were made to this rule, in order to avoid adding even more controversy to a decision that is already extremely divisive, the Senate, as the upper chamber of the Italian kingdom, is the most prestigious and respected political body of the State. Ciano has however remarked multiple times that there can be no democracy if the upper chamber is still packed with non-democratically elected representatives.\n\nBy now, it is pretty certain that the date of the election will be announced soon, and several parties and political movements are already starting to form, as the different strata and groups of Italian society start to look for those who could protect their interests. International media are still amazed at Ciano's push towards democracy, the first such case in a fascist country."

demitaly.16.d:0 "His faction shattered, his attempted coup of the PNF foiled, Scorza has been much quieter since the Verona Congress, stepping down from the position of Secretary of the PNF and being content to live as just another fascist uniform among many others. However, in his wisdom, the Duce has decided that Scorza's talent was wasted in Italy, and decided to assign him to a delicate and important diplomatic position, as an ambassador to the Caribbean island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nBehaving like a proper fascist, Scorza did not question the order coming from the Duce, and quietly accepted his duty. In his formal letter to him, Ciano urged him to show his devotion to the Italian nation and to the fascist cause by carrying out this task of the utmost geopolitical importance. Scorza will have to safeguard and uphold the Italian interests in the islands, making sure that the flame of the fascist revolution shines its light even half a world away.\n\nSince Ciano knew that Scorza would be so eager to complete this task, he didn't wait too long to send him on his way; this also meant that the few friends and associates Scorza still has in the PNF knew of his departure only when he was inside a plane above the Atlantic Ocean, but sometimes such things are inevitable. The whole nation of Italy places its hopes in Scorza, and the population will surely devote their thoughts to him and his mission."

The King has gracefully accepted to preside over the transition period, acting as the supreme executive power in Italy until the elections have taken place.\n\nThis moment marks a historic landmark for Italy, and will forever be remembered as the day when the birthplace of fascism decided to abandon that system, and return to democracy. In the shade of the great monuments of the fascist era, such as the EUR district in Rome, large crowds celebrate the beginning of a new era, which will mean freedom, prosperity and happiness for all.\n\nOptimism is universal at this point, as all major political factions think they have a good shot at winning the elections; the predictions made by media are completely inconsistent, with some polls projecting a victory for the liberals, others betting on the leftists, and a few are even adamant that it will be the neo-fascists who will secure the mandate. No one knows who will win the battle of democracy, but one thing is certain, Ciano, the Duce that ended fascism, has won his own battle."

cianopartysupport.5.t:0 "The First Election"
cianopartysupport.5.d:0 "It seems that the Italian Spring has finally turned into summer: the last remains of the fascist regime have thawed, melting away to reveal a blossoming democracy. Such an optimistic prospect, however, might be a bit too naive. The electoral race will be hotly contested, and while for now the prospect of violent radicalism is unlikely to materialize, the vote will reveal large fractures within the Italian society. Three parties have entered the fight, but only one can come out on top.\n\nTo the right, we have the Blocchi Nazionali. Ostensibly a big tent right-wing coalition, the BN is in fact dominated by former members of the PNF loyal to Ciano - the press calls them "neofascists", but it's tough to understand exactly how "neo" they are. Giorgio Almirante, their leader, is undeniably gifted at politics, and has rallied the vast majority of those who, for a reason or another, wish that fascism never went away. Voting for the BN means voting for status quo, stability, and continuation of policies that have proved successful in the past. A victory for the BN is unlikely, but not impossible - sometimes, in a democracy, the underdog can win.\n\nIn the centre, the Democrazia Cristiana. A coalition of liberals, centrists, and moderates, they designed a vast program of reforms aimed at bringing Italy into the modern age. Focusing on economic development, the DC hopes to abandon the cumbersome leftovers from the fascist era, while still respecting Italy's heritage, traditions and history. The DC are split between a liberal wing and a conservative one tied to the Church, but so far divisions have been set aside in favor of cohesion, and the party rallied behind the charismatic Aldo Moro. The DC attracts votes from the economically liberal but socially conservative upper - middle classes of Italy, as well as from the more Catholic-minded strata of the population. According to media observers, a DC victory is highly likely.\n\nTo the left, last but not least, the Fronte Democratico. Their platform can be summarized in a single word: antifascism. This wider leftist front, crafted by the political skill of former exile Pietro Nenni, sees fascism as the biggest threat to the existence of democracy, and has sworn to fight with all its strength to remove the vestiges of the fascist regime and give Italy the fresh start it deserves. The FD gets its votes mostly from students, for their promises of liberalization of education and press, and from the lower classes, who have been swayed by their promises of a strong welfare state and of policies meant to look after all Italians. It's difficult to estimate how likely a victory for the FD is, but it is certainly a real possibility.\n\nThe pieces have been set, and the game is in motion: the future of Italy will be shaped by these elections, more than it can be predicted now."

ita_grand_council_session:0 "Session XXXIII of the Grand Council"
ita_grand_council_session_desc:0 "In the year of our lord 1962, or the fortieth year of the Fascist Era, Italy stands as one of the world's largest empires and among the ranks of the world's great powers. The political situation in the country is fragmented however, with the ruling PNF, or Partito Nazionale Fascista, divided between the conservative and radical faction led by its secretary, Carlo Scorza, and a more progressive faction tied to the current Duce, Galeazzo Ciano. The Grand Council of Fascism, Italy's supreme executive body, has been called to decide on several issues currently plaguing the nation and its empire, in what is seemingly a routine session - however, what is decided here might have far reaching effects for Italy's future."

ita_forza:0 "Forza"
ita_forza_desc:0 "The primacy of Italy over its empire and its allies must not be ensured through naked coercion and sabre rattling. Instead, Italy must act as a beacon of stability, prosperity and peace in the Mediterranean and in Europe. We must act to better integrate the various nations under our protective wing into a unified economic and political structure. This is the official party line endorsed by Galeazzo Ciano, the current Duce, and while it might have prevailed at this session, it's hard to tell how well this will translate into practice."

ita_prepare_constitutional_comitee:0 "Prepare A Special Committee"
ita_prepare_constitutional_comitee_desc:0 "Around the person of Galeazzo Ciano, a small number of prominent party members and high ranking officials has gathered, functioning as an unofficial council of advisors to the Duce, including party politicians like Dino Grandi and generals such as Giovanni de Lorenzo. Solidifying and cementing this small clique as the Duce's inner circle will be vital to carry out Ciano's plans, as fierce opposition from within the ranks of the PNF might at any moment bring the Duce's reforms to a crashing halt. "

ita_speak_in_parliament:0 "Speak To The Council"
ita_speak_in_parliament_desc:0 "Among the ranks of the Grand Council, one can find an image of the varied and often contradictory components and interest groups that make up the fascist states. Blackshirt generals, fascist trade unionists, old time politicians, jurists, bureaucrats, scholars and many more. This somewhat colorful ensemble of characters, uniforms, medals and suits must be reigned in and convinced that the Duce is working for them all. Pleasing everyone is impossible, but there are surely many among the Council that could be swayed to Ciano's side, therefore strengthening his ranks and politically isolating Scorza."

ita_sicurezza:0 "Sicurezza"
ita_sicurezza_desc:0 "Our brave soldiers have won Italy the empire she deserved, our place in the sun. But maintaining an empire under control isn't easy - all over, subversives, terrorists and insurgents threaten the peace that we have established in the Mediterranean. We must act to ensure that nobody can dare to threaten our hold of the Mare Nostrum, unless we wish to see the empire that we endured so many hardships to build fall into anarchy. This is the line espoused by Carlo Scorza, secretary of the PNF, and which the current Duce was strong-armed into adopting to avoid risking a rebellion from within his own party. It's hard to say how much this new policy will affect reality, but observers from the nations in the Italian sphere don't seem too pleased."

Maintaining an empire is not an easy task, and thus we must utilize all the proper tools for the jobs - after all, the censorship laws, the OVRA, and the Special Tribunals for enemies of the state were created for a reason."

However, from all the corners of the Mare Nostrum, our brave men in uniform cry out that they need more men and resources to carry out their duties. Therefore, we must reinforce and strengthen our garrisons and armies across the whole Mediterranean, in order to make sure that nobody can threaten the Pax Romana."

ita_remind_the_king_desc:0 "His Imperial and Royal Majesty Umberto II, by the Grace of God and the Will of the Nation King of Italy and Albania, Emperor of Ethiopia, First Marshal of the Empire, is a man with numerous grandiose titles, but little real weight in politics. Italian kings have rarely directly meddled with their kingdom's political troubles, and Umberto II is no exception, instead preferring to act as a symbolic figurehead. However, with the Verona Congress now appearing on the horizon, it would be wise to involve the King in drawing up emergency and fallback plans in case something in Verona goes horribly wrong. We expect the Congress to proceed in an orderly and calm fashion, but perhaps one can never be too cautious."

ita_road_to_freedom:0 "The Road To Freedom"
ita_road_to_freedom_desc:0 "The numerous restrictions and oppressive measures that we have placed upon our numerous subjects in the empire were borne out of emergency. Now that our hold over the Mediterranean is firm, we can start moving towards granting greater autonomy and freedom to our vassals in the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa - we will still maintain our sphere of influence, but without the need for violence or threats. Italy shall be the first among equals in a community of nations, all sharing the common goal of building peace in Europe and protection against the brutality of the German boot."

ita_road_to_order:0 "The Road To Order"
ita_road_to_order_desc:0 "Italy has managed to succeed where most others, in history, have failed - creating a lasting peace in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East. Such a peace could only be achieved through might - the might of our armed forces. If we renounce our role as peacekeepers and guardians of order in our empire, we will undo all our past efforts, and thus we must reinforce our hold over the far reaches of our empire, from Algeria to Oman, in order to ensure that the Roman dream of Mussolini and of fascism doesn't disappear like sand in the wind."

ita_40_years_of_fascism_desc:0 "In forty years, Italy has gone far. From a nation threatened by poverty and bolshevism, to a glorious victory in a world war - from a weak nation almost destroyed by the First World War into one of the globe's major powers. For better or worse, fascism transformed our nation, turning it into what it is now - the names of Mussolini and the other great men of the regime will forever be consigned to history books as the creators and leaders of this brave new era. However, fascism's legacy is complex, and while some feel that the conquests of the fascist revolution have not gone far enough in creating a new order, many more believe that the fascist era has entered its final years. None can tell if this fortieth anniversary of the March on Rome marks the beginning of the end, or simply the end of the beginning."

ita_prepare_for_malta_conference_newintro_desc:0 "The Mediterranean is Our Sea, Mare Nostrum. At least that's what fascist propaganda tells people - as always, reality is a bit more complex than that. Our relationship with other major nations in the area has been regulated by the accords and treaties set up together with the so called Triumvirate, an alliance reuniting the three major nations of the region, Italy, Iberia, and Turkey. However, increasing issues over different spheres of influence, in Algeria, the Middle East, and other such problems are threatening the stability of this alliance. A conference in Malta, the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, will surely help reinforce the bonds between us and our loyal allies."

ita_send_out_the_invites_newintro_desc:0 "La Valletta, reclaimed in World War Two from the British who were squatting there since Napoleon's times and finally reunited with Italy, has never looked as beautiful as it does now. The flags of Italy, Iberia, Turkey and the smaller nations of the Triumvirate wave in the wind, and the hot Mediterranean sun kisses the rooftops and bell towers of the city as ships come and go from its harbor. The only thing left to do now is to send out the formal invitations to the politicians, diplomats and dignitaries that will arrive from all over the Mediterranean to convene in Malta, where hopefully a future of peace and shared prosperity for all of our nations can be built."

ita_am_icizia:0 "Impero"
ita_am_icizia_desc:0 "Italy currently boasts the world's fourth economy and its vast empire and sphere of influence span over three continents. A focus on proper foreign policy, which in the past has been neglected in favor of the pursuit of autarky, is now necessary to mend the various issues that plague the empire and its subjects. Deals with foreign powers, reworked relationships with vassal states and increased integration into the empire are just some of the problems that have to be addressed to achieve the prosperity we deserve."

ita_empire_renewal:0 "Empire Renewal"
ita_empire_renewal_desc:0 "Our empire is currently a patchwork of directly governed territories (such as Montenegro and Albania), military governates (such as the Levant), puppet states (such as Croatia and Egypt), allies and friendly regimes (such as the Arabian monarchies) and even a viceroyalty, Italian East Africa. Therefore, it should be no surprise that such a vast empire is somewhat disjointed - however, we should focus on improving economic and political integration between the various territories under our control. Building more infrastructure, encouraging political reforms and investing into the more underdeveloped parts of the empire are just some of the things we can do to move closer to achieving a status truly worthy of the name Pax Romana."

ita_citizens_in_NAF:0 "End Military Dominance of Libya"
ita_citizens_in_NAF_desc:0 "The territories of Libya have been annexed to the metropolitan kingdom of Italy in 1934 under the leadership of governor Italo Balbo. Since then, the indigenous Arabs who inhabit Libya have been granted the status of 'Italian Libyan citizens', which gives them a legal status identical to the Italians - however, this legal status is only valid as long as they reside in Libya, and outside of it they are simply colonial subjects of the Crown. The Muslim population of Libya has proved time and time again their loyalty to us, and we believe it's time to remove these restrictions and grant the Libyan Arabs the full status of Italian citizen."

ita_balkan_reform:0 "Balkan Initiative"
ita_balkan_reform_desc:0 "Our hold on the Balkans is currently dependent on three things: first the several regions under our direct control, such as Montenegro, Albania and Dalmazia, which in many cases are inhabited by non-Italian populations who have expressed discontent at our rule. Secondly, the Kingdom of Croatia, a nominally independent nation and factually puppet state, dealing with partisan insurgency and Ustaše terrorism. Thirdly, Greece, a state barely holding itself together under the pressure of several well armed and trained insurgent groups. The situation isn't exactly looking rosy, so addressing our Balkan woes is in order if we don't want that damn peninsula turning into the spark that ignites yet another crisis."

ita_algerian_summit:0 "Algerian Summit"
ita_algerian_summit_desc:0 "The situation in Algeria is, to put it simply, a complete mess. Pied-noir militias, native insurgent groups, and settler defense groups all fight over territory and oil producing regions, all while the whole country is nominally still part in the French State. In the recent years, Algeria became the theatre of low intensity warfare between these different groups, and the steady advance of Iberian soldiers and settlers into the territory is rapidly becoming a source of concern among both the Italian settlers and our military. We must immediately call a summit with Iberia to resolve the situation before it escalates."

ita_deustasization:0 "Crush the Ustaše"
ita_deustasization_desc:0 "After Yugoslavia was invaded by Axis forces in WW2, the Independent State of Croatia was established as a kingdom in the Italian sphere of influence, with Aimone di Savoia-Aosta ruling as King Tomislav II. However, real power in the country was in the hands of the Ustaše, a fascist and ultranationalist party and paramilitary known for its brutality against Serbs and other ethno-religious minorities. The leader of the Ustaše, Ante Pavelić, died in 1959, and this gave us the opportunity to intervene more directly in Croatia and sidelining the Ustaše more and more, to the point that they have turned against us and are now waging a guerrilla war against the Kingdom. We must quickly move more resources and men to Croatia to crush the Ustaše and its fanatical followers before they become too powerful!"

ita_slave_rights_gaming:0 "Rights For Refugees"
ita_slave_rights_gaming_desc:0 "After the end of World War II, Italy and her former German friend have started to drift apart more and more, as allies rapidly turned into bitter rivals. In the chaos that followed the economic crash of the '50s, a wave of refugees coming from Germany, largely Jews and members of other ethnic minorities, made their way to Italy to escape Nazi oppression. Many of them were resettled in the new Adriatic lands reclaimed by Atlantropa, and have lived there since then. While these communities have integrated rather well into Italian society, they still lack numerous basic rights granted to Italian citizens. We should move towards granting equality and rights to these men and women, so that they too can become children of Rome."

ita_croatia_on_the_road:0 "Croatia Center Stage"
ita_croatia_on_the_road_desc:0 "Croatia is quickly revealing itself to be the weak spot in our empire, with the Ustaše becoming an ever greater threat and the ZAVNOH partisans getting stronger with every passing day. The situation might quickly slip out of control if we don't immediately intervene. The autonomy and independence granted to the Croatian government will be further reduced, declaring a state of national emergency and giving supreme power to the cadre of Italian generals and advisors surrounding King Tomislav. An empire is not too different from a chain, and Croatia is its weakest link - we cannot allow it to break."

ita_potential_in_india_desc:0 "Since the Nineteenth Century our foreign and colonial policy has always had an eastern direction, with our two earliest colonies, Somalia and Eritrea, located on the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea respectively. Therefore, it is only natural that we seek closer trade deals and relationships with India, as this won't only allow us to find new profitable markets to sell our products to, but also reinforce our geopolitical presence in the Indian Ocean.

Some in Italy say that this happened in spite of its democratic and popular government, but many are starting to think that India's newfound prosperity and stability is actually the result of a well managed democracy. As goods and people pass through our Indian Ocean ports in ever greater quantities, ideas are starting to pass through as well, and having a friendly, powerful democratic ally will surely do no good for the fascist cause in Italy."

By creating new bureaucratic and legal frameworks to allow freer commerce and movement of goods and people in the Indian Ocean, as well as further investing into infrastructure, we can turn our eastern ports (such as Mogadiscio, Dubai and Assab) into international maritime trade hubs that will make our vast empire even more profitable."

ita_italo_japan_gaming:0 "Italo-Japanese Partnership"
ita_italo_japan_gaming_desc:0 "The economies of Japan and Italy are extremely compatible with one another, as the Italians can offer them massive amounts of oil in exchange for Japanese manufactured goods and raw materials from Sphere nations. By signing closer trade deals, we can increase the volume of goods moved between our respective sides of the Indian Ocean, therefore increasing our profit margins and the amount of money we'll be able to invest in our empire.

As a sign of friendship, the Regia Marina and the IJN will conduct joint military exercises and drills: not only this will strike fear in the heart of our rivals, but it will also give us important insight on how the world's foremost naval superpower manages its navy.

With delegates and representatives from all the upper echelons of the fascist government gathered in the Eternal City, the Duce took the floor to address the numerous problems faced by Italy and its empire. Despite being the world's fourth superpower, Italy is still plagued by a myriad of issues both domestic and foreign, including growing dissatisfaction towards the fascist regime and rising dissent in the colonies and puppets making up Italy's empire.\n\nCiano's speech was met with thunderous applause from the Grand Council, but one part of the delegates were much colder than others. Particularly, the current secretary of the PNF Carlo Scorza and the politicians closest to him within the party are known for their opposition to the Duce, and rumors seem to imply that tensions inside the PNF are growing by the day."

In a secret meeting at Palazzo Venezia, a small number of high ranking members of the PNF as well as some generals from the armed forces have gathered in Palazzo Venezia to speak with the Duce regarding the situation.\n\nIncluding party politicians like Dino Grandi, generals like Giovanni de Lorenzo and diplomats like Edgardo Sogno, this newly formed 'Secret Committee' will function as the Duce's inner circle to oppose the clique of party politicians gravitating around Carlo Scorza."

In a political power move that left many shocked, it seems that the secretary of the PNF, Carlo Scorza, has strong armed Ciano to let him speak before the congress almost as much as the Duce himself - after a short introductory address by Ciano, it was Carlo Scorza who took the floor.\n\nSuch a development is quite telling of the influence and power that Scorza has reached within the fascist government. There are many rumors circulating about Scorza's true aims and goals, but the only thing that is certain is that now someone is directly threatening Ciano's hold over the PNF."

itaintro.5.d:0 "The contradictions between different party lines in the PNF have become immensely apparent today, as Ciano's attempts to introduce reformist plans have bogged down, faced by fierce opposition from Scorza and his faction. Rapidly, the situation devolved into bickering and arguing in circles, and after sunset everyone left the Palazzo della Farnesina dissatisfaction and anger were visible in every politicians' face.\n\nThe situation seems to become more worrying by the day, as Ciano's position is becoming increasingly precarious. Scorza has been seen talking with numerous important gerarchi, as his political manoeuvring is becoming more and more blatant. International observers are starting to become concerned that the political situation in Italy might take a sudden shift in the near future."

In particular, Greece is a constant source of concern, as several partisan and insurgent groups still control large parts of the mountainous interior of the country.\n\nA proper anti-partisan campaign to get rid of the rebels would be too costly and difficult to carry out, but we can strengthen our hold of the major cities, like Athens and Thessaloniki, by sending more men and resources there. Already Italian troops and armored vehicles are embarking for Greece, and the garrisons already there have received orders to bolster their defensive positions.

The talks between the two have been largely kept secret from the media, but many speculate that Ciano is trying to seek the king's support in his political schemes - what's particularly attractive for the media is the upcoming Verona Congress, scheduled to take place a few months from now. The two are natural political allies, as many of the hardline fascists opposed to Ciano's reforms also call for the abolishment of the monarchy.\n\nThe first national congress of the PNF during Ciano's reign as Duce, the Congress will take place in the Venetian city famed as the setting of Romeo and Juliet. Like in the Shakespearean tragedy, Verona will be the battlefield of two angry opposing factions - with Carlo Scorza growing ever more powerful and respected in Italy's political apparatus, and the loyalty of the army and Blackshirts uncertain. It can only be hoped that the senseless tragedy portended by the play will not come to pass.\n\nKing Umberto is well known for his shyness regarding politics, so it's hard to predict what actions will he take, if any at all. However, with a political storm likely approaching on the horizon, many look towards the Crown as a stabilizing factor - one which the nation hopefully won't need. At a time when many had written off the whims and wants of Monarchs as relics of a long forgotten age, it seems that royalty still has a little kick left in it."

With fiery words, Roman reminiscences and rhetorical bombast, the Duce argued for a new policy towards the numerous Italian puppet states and allies in our sphere, from Algeria to Arabia, Eripus to Ethiopia. The grand plan includes granting more autonomy to subject states, gradually disengaging the Italian armed forces from the Empire and instead relying on native troops, and finally integrating the economies of the sphere to turn the Empire into a community in which Italy is a 'primus inter pares', in true Roman fashion.\n\nThe Council's reaction was..mixed. Split between thunderous applause and barely concealed rumbling, as the radicals within the PNF accused Ciano of betraying the principles of autarky and corporatism from which fascism rose. Such objections however fell on deaf ears, and many within the PNF look forward to the benefits of a new imperial policy, and perhaps reap some of them for themselves. "

itaintro.8.d:0 "Ciano's sidelining within the PNF is becoming ever more apparent, as he was forced to leave the floor to Carlo Scorza once again. With austere words, strong gestures and burning eyes he delivered a speech reminiscent of those of Cato Major in ancient Rome - Italy is burdened with a historical destiny, of ruling over the Mediterranean. This Empire that embraces three continents can be ruled by one thing alone - strength. And to show strength is what we need - more soldiers, larger ships, better weapons, all are needed to keep the Empire safe.\n\nApplause and cheers followed the speech, with even Ciano finding himself forced to timidly clap. As Scorza's appeal to strength and military power has silenced Ciano's democratizing ideas, many wonder what the implications of this renewed policy of militarism will mean for Italy's numerous subjects - but the more keen eyed political observers have predicted that it's only a matter of time before Carlo Scorza, the pretender, makes his move against Mussolini's heir."

The Italian eagle has spread her wings over the Mediterranean and risen over her enemies, defeating the British lion and reclaiming its Roman heritage. Troops paraded in Rome to celebrate the start of this ascent to imperial glory, the March on Rome, taking place in 1922, exactly four years ago. Men of the MVSN paraded among the Fori Imperiali, painting the Roman streets black with their uniforms; tanks of the Regio Esercito rolled in the streets, demonstrations of the might of the new Legions; the Regia Marina paraded with Junio Valerio Borghese and the Xª MAS at its head, as the crowds cheered the hero of Gibraltar and Alexandria; finally the aerobatic team of the Regia Aeronautica, the Frecce Tricolori, painted the skies of Rome green, white and red as the people below looked in awe.\n\nAnd after it was all done, one by one, the families who came to see the soldiers parade all went home - the fanfare ended, the politicians left the stage, and the troops returned to the barracks, Silence returned in the skies of Rome, as the moon illuminated the now empty Fori Imperiali and the Colosseum. A display of might is always reassuring, but sometimes it hides the true reality of things. With dissent spreading among the population, violent divisions emerging in the PNF, and the colonial empire becoming more and more unstable and troubled, the future of Italy, and of all Europe, hangs in the balance.\n\nIn the middle of the night, one man is still awake in Palazzo Chigi. A pile of documents sits on the Duce's desk, reports from ever more worried colonial governors, letters from members of the PNF obliquely criticizing him, and communiques from foreign leaders slathered in empty praises and vague words. However, in the silence of the night, Ciano is reading something else - a novel, titled The Leopard, published a few years ago by a Sicilian author - and one quote strikes him particularly..."

With the Italian Empire suddenly expanding to include many more territories and protected states, numerous problems quickly arose, mostly due to unending partisan activity, resistance from subject people and a slow recovery from the devastation of the war. Atlantropa only made things worse, wrecking the economy of numerous nations and forcing Mediterranean trade to be funneled across Suez, the lifeline of the Empire.\n\nIn such a situation, even the most staunch of conservatives can see the writing on the wall and be convinced that some form of action is needed, especially to amend the poor trade situation and to strengthen the Empire in general. The Duce proposed a series of radical changes to the administrative and economic realities of our great Empire, and no doubt change shall come."

itaintro.11.d:0 "A new round of meetings is set to take place in the Italian capital, as representatives from the local governments of several Italian puppet states and imperial dependencies have gathered to push for new policies to be implemented across the Empire. Delegates from Egypt, led by Commissioner Italo Balbo, arrived together with generals from the governates of the Levant, followed by a small crowd of politicians and even native representatives from Italian East Africa all convened in Rome, each hoping to see reforms and changes brought about for their slice of the Empire.\n\nThe path to further cooperation and integration among the various parts of the Empire won't be an easy one, as contrasting interests and requests for more autonomy make this endeavor a political nightmare. However, important concessions have already been made by Rome, as Ciano renewed promises to increase political autonomy for states under Italian protections, and to loosen the hold that the Italian armed forces have over territories like the Levant."
itaintro.11.a:0 "Perhaps the Imperial dream isn't dead"

itaintro.12.t:0 "The Integration of Libya"
itaintro.12.d:0 "In a historic turn of events, all the barriers left between Italians and Libyans were torn down by Ciano's signature, as a new law was approved finally granting Libyans with Italian citizenship. Ciano announced this decision by condemning 'mistakes' committed by Italy in the past regarding the Libyan population, referencing the infamous massacres committed in Cyrenaica in the 1920s, while at the same time expressing his hope that this reform is the last act of the decades long integration of Libya within Italy. With the Italian and Arab populations having lived largely in peace for about two decades now, this new law recognizes the de facto assimilation of the native Muslim population into the Italian administrative unity.\n\nPublic opinion has been mixed about this new development, but the Libyan public opinion generally approved the elimination of one last bureaucratic hurdle that kept them from being considered full Italian citizens. However, many wonder if this is truly enough to contain autonomist and independentist movements from being active in the region, or if this decision might backfire in the future."
itaintro.12.a:0 "At least it should"

itaintro.13.t:0 "Reeling In Croatia" ##Croatia is about to lose autonomy##
itaintro.13.d:0 "With the situation in Croatia becoming ever more worrisome, Ciano has released a press statement regarding the possibility of a 'greater involvement' of Italian forces in the region. While in the past the Italian government has always presented its puppet state, Croatia, as a successful and prosperous country, Ciano painted a grim picture of the real situation in the Kingdom, citing the recent rise in partisan activity and the ever present threat of the Ustaše.\n\nCroatia has enjoyed close ties to Italy since World War II, when an Italian king was placed on the throne of the newly created kingdom. However, it seems that soon the country might find itself occupied once again by Italian forces intervening to shore up the Kingdom against insurgent movements."
itaintro.13.a:0 "This can't end well"

itaintro.14.t:0 "The Algerian Summit" ##Meet with Iberia, NOT IN ALGIERS, to discuss border disputes. No progress is made##
itaintro.14.d:0 "Diplomats from Iberia and Italy have met in Palermo to discuss the current situation in Algeria. Considering the extremely chaotic and complex situation that the region currently is in, the news that the summit ended without any serious accomplishment was taken with no surprise. The poorly defined and porous borders between the military administrations of the two respective countries have done very little to halt the passage of weapons, militias and smuggled goods from one side to the other, and each country was happy to blame the other for that.\n\nOther points of contention included the support and armament of Pied Noirs militias, mostly reunited under the Cité Catholique umbrella organization led by Yves Guérin-Sérac, by Iberia's military government - Iberian representatives responded by pointing out the rampant mafia activities in Italian controlled areas and the alleged support given by Italy to Algerian independentist groups. Each side ended up denying the other's accusation, but it seems that what truly caused this heated climate was leaked reports from ENI, the Italian oil company, suggesting that the Algerian region may be rich in oil deposits. With all these overlapping interests and the general instability of the area, many predict that an escalation might be inevitable."
itaintro.14.a:0 "Is this yet another war on the horizon?"

itaintro.15.t:0 "Operation Trolista"
itaintro.15.d:0 "The international press is reporting that troops of the Croatian kingdom, aided by Italian advisors and reinforcements, have begun to carry out Operation Trolista, a country-wide military and police operation aimed at arresting prominent people associated with or part of the Ustaše and eliminating Ustaše holdouts in rural areas of the country. In urban areas, the operation sometime resulted in guerrilla as Ustaše supporters were informed about the operation in advanced and fought back against the soldiers who came to apprehend them, resulting in small scale urban warfare.\n\nIn rural areas, the situation was much worse: heavy fighting has been reported in mountainous regions, in which Ustaše paramilitary groups still control a few hamlets and villages, many of which were either besieges and conquered after brutal combat or simply bombed into dust by Italian artillery fire. Overall, it is difficult to gauge exactly how much Trolista has actually weakened the Ustaše - while many members of the paramilitary organization have been either arrested or killed, numerous important figures of the organization, including its de facto leader Jure Francetić, seem to have de facto vanished into thin air, escaping the grasp of Italian and Croatian forces."
itaintro.15.a:0 "Hopefully this is enough to stop those fanatics"

itaintro.16.t:0 "The Situation Regarding German Refugees"
itaintro.16.d:0 "In the last decade, the political relationship between the former Axis powers of Europe, Germany and Italy, soured to the point of no return, and turned the two allies into bitter rivals. When the economic crisis was rocking the German sphere, Italy was also suffering, but certainly not as much as its northern neighbor - thus, the Italian boot were a natural destination for the thousands of refugees that sought escape from Nazi persecution and terror, seizing their chance to flee the grasp of Germania in the chaos of the West Russian War and the economic crash.\n\nNumerous Jews, Roma and Sinti people, and even other persecuted groups such as homosexuals fled towards Italy, hoping to find refuge in a country that, while still fascist, was much more lenient than the Reich towards discriminated groups. The then Minister of Foreign Affairs and now Duce Galeazzo Ciano was supportive of Mussolini's decision to give refuge to the escaping masses, and many of them were dispersed across the vast reaches of the Empire. However, many still live in refugee camps and temporary structures, many of them located in the reclaimed lands in the Adriatic. The Duce has signed an order allocating resources to encourage integration and an eventual path to citizenship for the German refugees, in order to turn them from a burden on the back of the state into a valuable asset for our Empire."
itaintro.16.a:0 "The Roman Empire was all about assimilation and integration after all"

itaintro.17.t:0 "Operation Teuta" ##Croatia has lost autonomy##
itaintro.17.d:0 "At midnight of yesterday Italian troops deployed along the border with Croatia have launched Operation Teuta. Italian armored columns and troops have marched into Croatia, advancing into the Kingdom's territory to bolster the already existing garrisons in several major cities, as well as set up new bases deep in the countryside and the mountains of the country. According to the first reports, anti-partisan operations have already started, with sparse fighting in the hills of the interior. The major target of the operation however still seems to be the final eradication of the Ustaše from the country.\n\nInternational media has called Operation Teuta a second invasion of Croatia, and any pretense that the country had any sort of autonomy or sovereignty is now lost. Everyone can plainly see that the Croatian Kingdom is de facto an Italian military administration, currently struggling to contain its numerous opponents. Italian public opinion has been critical of this new development, as many fail to see the benefit of yet another campaign of repression that will surely result in numerous Italian lives being wasted."
Itaintro.17.a:0 "It might be the only solution to this mess"

itaintro.18.t:0 "Indian Trade"
itaintro.18.d:0 "After Atlantropa and the collapse of our relations with Germany, the Italian Empire was left starved for trade. While the formation of the Triumvirate has ameliorated these issues to an extent, more trade relations with other countries can't hurt our country.\n\nTo this end, our diplomats have entered talks recently with the Republic of India, a natural trade partner in the Indian Ocean, in an attempt to increase trade between our two nations. It seems that our efforts have borne fruit, as the Indian government has agreed to sign a trade agreement between our two great nations, which will surely improve our trade issues. "
itaintro.18.a:0 "Another step in the long road towards economic recovery."

itaintro.19.t:0 "The Indian System"
itaintro.19.d:0 "Italy and India have never been particularly close, an isolation re-enforced by distance and opposed politics. Still, in some ways, India is not too distant from us. They are a second-rate power, with few friends and many enemies. Despite this, we have both stood tall in a hostile world. We are not as powerful as the Reich or Japan, but we are still a force to be reckoned with. However, much to the chagrin of many fascists here in Italy, they are not fascist. The intellectual basis for the continuation of the fascist regime is that a relatively isolated power such as ourselves can only stay alive through a strong, ordered nation, casting away pretensions such as individualism and democracy as detrimental to the ultimate goal. India, in contrast holds free elections, lacks a corporatist economy, and is not culturally constructed around a staunch sense of nationalism. Yet, somehow, they are powerful, and Nehru's government is quite stable, on par with us and on par with the world. How could this be?"
itaintro.19.a:0 "Perhaps men are not tired of liberty."

itaintro.20.t:0 "Indian Ocean Wind"
itaintro.20.d:0 "Chairman Mattei looked from the windows of ENI's headquarters building in Dubai, a modern, shiny building made of glass and steel, but still somewhat influenced by the rationalist style typical of fascist architecture. From his office, he could enjoy an eagle's view over Dubai's port, and there he saw a large ship, from which many men, not too dissimilar from ants at this distance, slowly disembarked one by one. The first ship of workers from India had arrived.\n\nDubai is a strange place: envisioned by the fascist leadership as a shining city in the desert, built as a pet project to rival Atlantropa, it rapidly became a fiefdom of ENI when staggering amounts of oil were discovered in the area. Fueled by the oil fever, Dubai kept growing, and its expanding oil and naval industries are ever thirsty for more man power. Thanks to the new trade deals between Italy and India, new and marvelous opportunities of profit will be realized in Dubai, much to the benefit of both our great nations."
itaintro.20.a:0 "Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai."

itaintro.21.t:0 "Trade Deals With Japan"
itaintro.21.d:0 "To the east, the ocean gleams, shining with opportunity. While our relationships with Germany might have gone sour, our friendship with Japan is still as strong as it was when the Tripartite Pact was first signed in 1940, despite the recent and troublesome events that shook the two great Empires. The most natural solution to reinvigorate our economy would be a renewed trade compact with Japan, allowing us to exchange oil and manufactured goods for cheap resources extracted in the Sphere, which will serve to fuel our industrial expansion.\n\nA team of diplomats, including representatives of ENI hand picked by Enrico Mattei, has started to negotiate the exact term of these accords with representatives of the Rising Sun, and it seems that an official visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ino is going to take place in Rome soon."
itaintro.21.a:0 "Trusted friends are always nice to have"

itaintro.22.t:0 "Roman Evenings"
itaintro.22.d:0 "The Sun sets over Rome, its rays playing with the branches of the cypress trees that line the Appian Way. The cobblestone road seems to stretch eternally in the hills that surround the city, as it once did when Roman legionaries, merchants, peasants and emperors walked along it. Now the Appia Antica is much more quiet, and only two people are walking on it, talking quietly in a perfect French, the language of diplomacy. After all the fanfare, the politics, and the crowds, the Duce proposed a tranquil walk among the Roman ruins of the Appian Way to conclude the last day of Japanese Prime Minister Hiroya Ino's official state visit to the Italian capital.\n\nAs the sound of cicadas is heard faintly in the background, Ciano and Ino find themselves more and more involved in their informal conversation, which started from personal themes such as tastes in music and theatre - but rapidly took much more melancholic undertones. As the first stars begin to appear in the evening sky, two men realize more and more that perhaps, even if separated by oceans and continents, they are not much different from each other. The burden of ruling an empire on the brink of catastrophe, threatened by outside enemies and torn by internal fights, the extenuating task of being forced to commit ever more morally dubious acts of realpolitik, the ever present terror of the possibility that in the end it was all for nothing: such things cannot be easily shared. But perhaps, in that Roman sunset, as the cicadas sung, two men found some peace, even if it was just for a passing moment."
itaintro.22.a:0 "Sometimes, one needs to put things into perspective."

itaintro.23.t:0 "The Nagasaki Trade Compact"
itaintro.23.d:0 "A new commercial agreement was signed today in Nagasaki by Italian diplomats and representatives from Japan, Manchuria, China, Guangdong and several other nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Perhaps an event not attracting as much attention as the naval exercises or the state visits, it however far exceeds them in importance. Both nations stand to benefit from the new trade compact, as it allows freer circulation of goods and capital in the Indian Ocean, thus linking the vital resources possessed by the two empires."
itaintro.23.a:0 "Here's to profit!"

itaintro.24.t:0 "Our Success With Japan"
itaintro.24.d:0 "An Italian ship sails into the port of Tokyo. On its deck are hundreds of containers. Some carry the goods that are famously Italian - wine, motor scooters, the like. In others, machine parts and grain. Only a few hundred metres away, barrels of oil are piped out of Italian tankers. Italian oil, extracted from North Africa, now fuels the Japanese Army from Manchuria to Bengal, offsetting the need to exploit the relatively limited Sphere reserves. But the success does not stop here. No, it goes far further. Italian ties and suits fly off the shelf in the Mitsukoshi department stores. Italian cinema dominates Japanese theaters. An "Italy Fever" has seemed to have swept Japan. It certainly will not last, but it still proves just how quickly our new friendship has come together. Still, the most important effect of our new success is the cash that returns to Italy, to Italian artisans and Italian manufacturers. This new cash will help in the rejuvenation of our economy, and will help propel us into an Italian century!"
itaintro.24.a:0 "Salute!"

itaintro.25.t:0 "Suez Sunrise" ##Bad trade will naturally go away in 10 years, Suez is VERY important
itaintro.25.d:0 "Another day, another shift for the many soldiers and sailors staffed in the many military installations in Suez. The Egyptian sun is as ruthless as it always was, but in recent times something has changed indeed: more and more ships pass through the Canal with each passing day. Japan, India, China, Australia, Thailand: Suez is turning more and more into a true Babel of languages and races, all passing through under the watchful eye of the Regia Marina.\n\nSince the creation of Atlantropa, Suez became the jugular vein of the Italian Empire, the one passage that connects the Mediterranean with the rest of the world's waters. Italy's monopoly over it is a vital asset for the Empire, and thus it should be no surprise that the place is one of the most heavily fortified regions in the world, dotted with military installations, bunkers, outposts and fortifications. Losing Suez is synonymous with losing the Empire, and everyone of some importance in Italy's government knows that perfectly."
itaintro.25.a:0 "The fate of our country rests on a canal?"

itaintro.27.t:0 "Italian Delegation Sent To Tokyo"
itaintro.27.d:0 "In a newly constructed building in the Bunkyō ward of Tokyo, the Italian Economic Delegation has finally set up shop. The culmination of the new trade deals recently undertook by Italy with Japan, the Delegation will serve as a board of businessmen and industrialists keeping contacts and renewing deals with Japanese zaibatsus and keiretsus, much to the advantage of Italian businesses selling and buying in the area.\n\nRepresentatives from ENI, Olivetti, Finmeccanica and even relatively minor ones like Ferrari will now have a direct link with the Far East, allowing the Italian government to reap the benefits of transoceanic trade."

ita_the_death_of_mussolini_desc:0 "Our glorious leader, Benito Mussolini, has passed on from this world. The exact cause of his death may have been humiliatingly having a stroke and being hung from his balcony upside down, but he was still the greatest, most honourable man in Italy and the Caesar to the Triumvirate alliance, meaning he must be presented to the populace with a bit more dignity than he left with. After spinning his death into something that doesn't cause all Italians to immediately erupt into laughter, we will need to begin making the proper arrangements. First off, a state funeral was to be held that included opera performances, festivals, a grand military parade, the construction of huge statues all over the empire, and an entire month of mourning sufficient enough to faithfully serve his memory. Next, after the past is setted we must look to the future; specifically who shall replace Mussolini as Il Duce. This issue is of course made difficult due to the fact that Mussolini hadn't made any preparations whatsoever in case of his demise and there is no precedent dictating how to go about replacing him with a new Duce. The most obvious successor is of course Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law. Of course, he cannot simply take the mantle without first going through a long string of bureaucracy and politics."

He served Italy as a skilled foreign minister who both triumphed in war and peace, preferring the latter yet willing to wage the former. His great skill in international diplomacy, however, is what makes him extraordinary, with Albania even making him an honorary citizen out of appreciation of his service right before orchestrating their invasion. As such, he has always seemed to be the natural heir of Mussolini, and therefore should take the initiative to step up and be declared the new Duce. After he accepts the position, it will be up to him to take Italy by the hand and lead her through a new era, one characterised more by diplomacy, his specialty, rather than the warmongering of the previous decades. Italy is in a difficult position, surrounded by enemies, and we need a strong leader. We need someone willing to do whatever it takes to ensure our survival and prosperity, and if Ciano can survive the tests that he faces and fill the shoes Mussolini left, then we may just overcome yet again."

These past years have been rough on all of us, and many are feeling the already straining tensions in the alliance, meaning this conference will be a crucial point in deciding whether or not the Triumvirate has what it takes to persist for more than a few months. Due to the importance of such an occasion, we are planning on hosting this meeting on the Mediterranean island of Malta. This is due to the fact that Malta is small, although slightly larger from Atlantropa, secure, and centralised, allowing us to enforce security and keep the delegates safe. Everyone involved will be on their toes of course, and if we mess something up our fate could take a turn for the worse. It is likely that, if successful, this conference could become an annual occurrence, cementing our stability and bringing the great nations together as friends. Now, it is time to go forth and send the invitations to Iberia and Turkey, all the while hoping they too believe in supporting this new wave of diplomacy."

After all, we wouldn't be much of an alliance if we didn't help each other every now and then. Therefore, it has been suggested by some Italian officials that we form a joint task force that doubles as both a means to effectively eradicate rebels in our colonies and a way to present Italy's honest intentions to our sceptical neighbors. Of course, many of these attacks on insurrectionists will need to be far from Algeria and the Levant, as this would only cause further conflict among the allies. Specifically, we should create a program in the Balkans region to deal with the many, many partisans alongside the Turks, giving us an opportunity to both work together while simultaneously removing the thorn that is insane guerillas from our side. We must be careful, however, as we wouldn't want to give our new friends too much access to our military secrets, and it would be quite terrible if some of our soldiers accidentally, or purposefully, shoot each other, which would likely end with the immediate dissolution of the Triumvirate."

ita_avoid_the_border_issues_desc:0 "Our victory in the Second World War reaped many spoils for the Empire, mostly in the form of former British and French colonies in Africa and the Middle East. Many of these territories, most notably Algeria, Syria, and especially Cyprus, have been a source of contention with Iberia and Turkey. In Algeria, many settlers from Italy and Iberia converged inwards at a rapid pace, a process that has recently lead to disputes over the former French land. And the island of Cyprus, which was formerly a territory under the Ottoman Empire, was given to us rather than the Turks, leading to much hostility on their part. These issues have not disappeared with the formation of the Triumvirate, and if they are not settled soon, will likely become its downfall. Therefore, it has been suggested that we seek to both limit our involvement in the trouble zones while simultaneously speaking with our allies in an attempt to end this potentially deadly dispute. It is worth noting that, even if Ciano had any intention of conceding our new colonies, nobody in the mainland would support such a proposal and it would certainly see him out of office. As such, a permanent solution is nearly impossible."
ita_pussy_out:0 "It is very obvious to all members of the alliance that this is one of convenience rather than anything else. The disputes between all three of us are many, and in the name of stability we must avoid all discussion of these."

The Council, consisting of the senior ranking officials of the Fascist Party and many members of the Italian Senate, has been quickly assembled in Rome, awaiting the start of the conference. The delegates will discuss everything about the character of Ciano, painstakingly analyzing his loyalty, ability to lead, and intentions of reformation. Even the most irrelevant, miniscule detail has been uncovered, from conversations forty years ago to descriptions of his attire. During the middle of the forum, they will even call Ciano himself to the floor in an effort for him to explain himself and what he has done and would do for Italy. The decision that they are expected to reach upon the conclusion of the meeting is that the Council will find it in the empire's best interests to both nominate and sponsor Ciano for the position of Duce. Not even the biggest sceptics think that Ciano will have any difficulty securing the Grand Council's support, but anything is possible in this strange, strange world."

The King, who has reigned since the death of Victor Emmanuel III, is a symbol of the new Italy, much as the new Duce is. Relations between His Majesty and the Duce can be expected to be cordial: Ciano is a much more moderate leader, and less of a radical fascist. Given that some extreme fascists have called for the end of the Monarchy in the past, the House of Savoy will be relieved to have an ally as Duce. The King and the Duce can be expected to discuss several matters, ranging from the state of the Italian colonial empire, to Italy's relationship with Germany, the economy, and the pressing situation with the Triumvirate."

We must make sure that we spare no expense in the ceremony, and do everything we can to show the power of Italy. Rome itself will need to be prepared for such an event. Military marches and security must be prepared, logistics shall be coordinated, and roads shall be closed so that Ciano can get to the Quirinal and not be caught up by the cheering crowds. We must use the swearing in of Ciano to show that Italy is not weak. To this end, we should make sure that this event is broadcasted far and wide, from New York to Tokyo, show we can show the whole world, from our allies in the Triumvirate, to the leaders of OFN and the Co-Prosperity Sphere, to even our enemies in the Unity-Pakt that Italy is still one of the greatest and most nations on the planet!

Obviously, Germany is off the table for cooperation, seeing as they have been quite hostile towards us, but that just puts us into the perfect position to gain support from the United States and the Japanese. Both have shown themselves more than willing to help any and all enemies of the Reich, and it would only make sense for us to go to them for potential aid. We have already spoke with America, albeit briefly, about the prospect of sending over some military equipment and personnel to help train our men, and so far they have seemed willing. Therefore we must redouble our efforts with them while simultaneously sending diplomats over to Tokyo to try and get military aid that way. Maybe, in the future, we can even escalate these talks and secret deals into an actual alliance that would serve to give us total protection from the Nazis, but that would take a lot more time and effort to accomplish."

We cannot hope to keep them at bay for long, and only through reaching out and making new allies with our Mediterranean brothers Iberia and Turkey can we hope to deter their aggression. Although some disputes exist between us and our opinions of each other are quite poor, the direness of the situation will certainly force them to work with us. Even if they don't like us one bit, by initiating these talks and extending an olive branch we can achieve the impossible and safeguard our future from our mutual enemy, the Reich. Ciano himself, a skilled diplomat, will take personal charge in leading this new foreign policy. We are only hoping that our Mediterranean neighbors at least give us a chance to explain ourselves without acting like the fools most Italians think they are and turning us away."

If we want this new alliance to work out, we will surely be forced into cooperation, meaning it is time to send a diplomatic envoy to Ankara with the purpose of trying to smooth over our tense relationship and prepare them for an official conference. Hopefully, the Middle Eastern border situation and disputed claims in the Mediterranean will not come up in our first attempt at contact so as to keep the engagement as positive as possible. We will, however, be sure to mention how Atlantropa has destroyed both of our economies and the German Reich, a mutually hated enemy, is to blame. Doing so will surely make the Turkish upset and more willing to do whatever it takes to get back at the Germans. If all goes well, we will have a great opportunity to advance the talks and establish a formal alliance. If not, then this whole thing will be over before it even began."

This will be quite tricky, as the two nations in the Union are infamous for disagreements and endless bureaucracy, meaning without them having massive support for our plan it is likely to not come to fruition. So by sending diplomats to Madrid and Lisbon, and taking these matters slowly, we can hope to reach both the Caudillos and the people's ears. One issue that is on our side, however, is that the Iberians hate the Germans as much as we do, and Atlantropa has devastated their economy as well. We just have to avoid mentioning the Algerian issue or making any promises we don't intend on keeping, like subsidizing the Gibraltar Dam. If we are successful, and have Iberia on our side, we will know that this alliance can be realized and Ciano can achieve his plan for stopping the Germans from taking advantage of us or our neighbors anymore."

Knowing beforehand that Türkeş had quite a hot temper and deep anti-German sentiments, Ciano decided to convince him that it was in Turkey's best interests to come together to counter the Reich. Il Duce is also planning on both announcing support for Turkey's claims on Azerbaijan and again mentioning the damages left by Atlantropa in an attempt to show the Turkish Başbuğ that Italy feels their pain and wants to do everything in his power to alleviate it. Near the end of the two men's meeting, Ciano is planning on formally announcing his intentions for a full alliance and economic pact as a means to mutual prosperity. So as long as Türkeş doesn't do or say anything insanely short-sighted and nationalistic, this could be a major turning point in the two nation's histories, and a great step towards Ciano's dream of a Mediterranean bloc."

As such, Ciano himself is climbing into the two spider's webs and will try to both get the two to agree to cooperation and raise anti-German sentiments as a means to make them appear to be natural allies. Il Duce will have to be careful, however, as one wrong move and one of the finicky dictators is likely to shut down and end all negotiations right then and there. Iberia and Italy haven't exactly seen eye to eye in the last decade, and many people are doubtful of our chances to mend the rift between us. But diplomacy is Ciano's specialty, and we have every confidence in his ability to achieve a favorable outcome and ensure Iberia's entrance into our new alliance. And if he is unsuccessful, well, nobody can say that we didn't try to reach out to our neighbors."

We shall now move on to Ciano's grand plan of creating a Mediterranean alliance focused around the three powers, a pact which will ensure our survival in the face of the German menace and give us hope for the future. We shall be known, from now until Europe is saved, as the Triumvirate. Much like the Triumvirates of ancient Rome, we will be the three great leaders who lead the world into a new era, an era were we can be safe and secure from any threat, be it economic or militaristic. We shall rule our empires with an ironfist and hearts of roses, as dictators who love their people. And when the time comes when we are put to the final test of battling the leering Nazis beyond the Alps, we will give them hell! This is what Il Duce desires, and it is high time we bring Turkey and Iberia in on the plan.

But as fate brings pain and humiliation onto the strong and pure nations of the world, so too does it give them the strength to rise against their oppressors. Germany was able to unify first, and as brothers should, they lent us a hand in their own struggle. It is thanks to Germany that there is a Italian at all, and we are forever in their debt. But it was Italy that first cast off the binds of pathetic liberalism, Jewish bolshevism, and western cowardice. When the first Duce, Benito Mussolini, lifted our nation from the dirt. It was he who inspired the eternal Führer, Adolf Hitler, to do the same in the north. We fought together in the second Weltkrieg, greatest of all wars, Germans bled for the Italian Empire, and Italians for Lebransaum. We are brothers in blood, in steel, and in truth. Friends first, and above all. More recently, our nations have been joined once again in suffering. Perfidious liberals, distorters of the true National Socialist way, false fanatics and cowards alike seek to turn us against each other, and weaken the Axis that built the New Order.

For the sake of our future, and the sake of Europe, for the Aryan legacy that both our nations share.

But is that the REAL truth? And given our ongoing rapprochement with the Germans, even if the response to that question is "yes of course it is, read any book or go outside and look at the beach for a few seconds", is it necessarily the most convenient truth? Maybe what really happened was that everything was all good, then the treacherous Iberians decided to attack the Gibraltar dam, seizing it from Germany and changing the water level to screw everyone in the Mediterranean but them. Maybe Jewish terrorists attacked both dams, and it was only the heroic intervention of a joint Italian and German team that managed to descend the Gibraltar straits. Maybe some of those dissidents the government's been locking up lately had something to do with it. All of these are clearly strong theories worth investigating in the court of public opinion.

While the Duce was waking up in the morning and preparing to spend another day keeping Italy safe, a four foot tall Spaniard lept in from the balcony and began firing a revolver at Mussolini. However, the Duce quickly responded and bravely tried to fend off this mysterious attacker with nothing but a bottle of wine and his will to survive. Sadly, just as our great leader was about to land a killing blow, three more assailants jumped into his room and peppered him with bullets. As a servant ran into the room to find the source of all the commotion, she was shocked to find Mussolini on his bed bleeding out, only able to say his last words, a cry for vengeance.

At this point, however, Ciano is going to have to make a choice about just how far his reforms are going to go. If he makes too many changes and liberalizes too quickly, he will soon find himself at odds with most of the traditional fascists. If he does too little and maintains an oppressive authoritarian regime, then he risks betraying Italy and his people. As Ciano rearranges the government and gives and takes positions from people, all of this must be considered.

Ciano knows that he must defy both, revolutionaries and reactionaries, for the greater glory of his people. Fascism needs to be updated for a colonial empire that exists on the ground, rather than just in the hearts and minds of its citizens. The blackshirts and the harsh laws they enforce were necessary to purify the Italian state, but now serve only to keep it in the past.

It is the opinion of Ciano and the grand council that the benefits that this development brings to Italy, in the enhancement of Italy's "soft power" and the weakening of enemy regimes from the inside, outweighs the potential cost of subversion. Hence, it is time to spread this spirit of innovation throughout the nation, and to make de-facto what had been previously de-jure. Though some hardliners have raised concerns about the potential ramifications of this approach regarding the strength and moral character of the Italian people, thes extremists have been overruled and their names marked as potentially disloyal. After all, the past is not the present, and Italy today is not the Italy of Mussolini's time when leftism and degeneracy ran rampant.

Although nowhere near as troublesome as their German equivalents, they have as of late been a little too rambunctious. Many local police stations have been complaining about members of the blackshirts disregarding the law for years, with public intoxication and disorderly conduct being the two most common charges. As such, Ciano has decided to meet with their leaders personally to ensure that a stronger hand will be used to reign in the militiamen and keep them off the streets where they seem to cause the most issues. Ciano is sure that they will listen, as they have declared loyalty solely to him, Il Duce, and will respect his wishes in full.

Already, the new generation of students and young adults are crying out for freedom and other such nonsense, and if we don't give them a voice, albeit a quiet and controlled one, they may turn to the socialists or some other militants to accomplish their goals. Along with this, much of Italy is still conservative, and allowing more citizens to speak will give them a chance to support Il Duce and his reforms in the future.

Count Ciano has decided that this area is ripe for reform. First, the broad regulations so-often used by hardline judges to pick unnecessary fights will be narrowed, only prohibiting films guilty of "pornography, drug use, sedition, miscegenation, or overt rebellion", and allowing directors to over-dub or remove the offending sections to remove their film from the blacklist. Second, the power of film censorship will be moved from the Ministry of Information to the Ministry of Culture, where it will be performed by a council not only of fascist officials, but actors, writers, and directors as well. Finally, the government shall begin instituting a limited amount of grant money for the production of "patriotic and heroic films", to strengthen these trends within the industry.

The law was only used once before the war in which Mussolini took absolute control, but was reinstated during elections afterward when Mussolini began his policy of rolling back his power to 1920's levels. Ciano, wishing to take these reforms a step further, is now attempting to change the text of these laws. By returning the system back to one of proportional representation, he is hoping that the people, both in other parties and the general public, will appreciate his new regime more and support his reforms in the future.

We've been patient with these sticks-in-the-mud for too long, and it's time to show them the fate that awaits those who stall Italy's march into the future. Naturally, if we throw too many hardline fascists into jail, it might put some silly ideas into the heads of the rabble-rousers within the public.

Unfortunately, they seem to think that this merits the restoration of the freedoms reduced in the early days of the Empire. There is hardly a street free of their accursed pamphlets, while even the most obviously degenerate of the banned films draws hundreds of students to underground theatres. Ciano has previously instructed the police and blackshirts to deal with these spoiled children gently, and above all quietly, but thanks to the growing polarization of Italian society even these have the potential to escalate into crisis'. In this time of popular upheaval, the party's favorite tactics of midnight blackshirt raids and tragic "suicides" of dissidents that others should learn from are no longer feasible. Therefore our great leader has decided to rescind nearly all existing youth restrictions, ranging from protest prohibitions, curfews, banned student groups and academic blacklists.

While he knows that it would be political suicide to eliminate the more connected individuals, it will be possible to remove the extreme outliers of the party. By sending just a couple of his most loyal blackshirts to meet with these buffoons, Ciano can ensure that they are either stripped of all power or arrested so as to no longer cause any problems. It is unlikely that anybody will mourn their loss anytime soon, however we are worried that this will cause outcry amongst the traditional fascists who may believe that they could be the next ones to be shown the door.

A confrontation looms in Algeria with rival Iberian settlers, while Tunisia remains filled with insurgents who ranging from socialists, Arab nationalists, and french remnants.

Here the Italian presence is limited to a dirty guard post, a few drunk Blackshirts to man it, and a flag on its wall obscured by Arabic slogans. A few kilometers more, and the unnamed citizen would be in the desert, with nothing but sand dunes, tribesman, and death to keep him company. The time has come for Italy's settlers to reclaim the legacy of our nation's great explorers, and venture into the hinterlands. We will begin by establishing small ports and restoring bases along the Libyan cost, in Adibijaya, Brega, Ras Lunaf, Sirte, Masalla, Derna, and Tobruk .

However, when the Italian soldiers ventured into their new territory, they found it stricken with chaos. French remnants, Arab revolutionaries, Berber tribes and desert nomads all vied for supremacy. The territory had to be placed under martial law, and units sent in surplus to eliminate the insurgents. With all the chaos, what few settlers arrived didn't stay long. After almost 20 years of Italian military administration, Tunisia is a bit quieter. Italian soldiers are still subject to the occasional ambush or roadside bomb attack, but buy and large they go about their duties in peace.

The Levant is plagued with Jewish-Arabic tensions, our hold on Egypt is getting worryingly weak since the '56 revolution, and East Africa continues to be nothing but a financial burden. Despite all these problems, we need to help our vassals shore up their weaknesses, whether it is reinforcing Amadeo in his reforms in Eastern Africa, helping quell ethnic tensions in the Levant by giving the people there more freedom, and perhaps even allowing Farouk to do as he pleases in hopes that he will eventually understand the importance of ruling Egypt."

All it takes for us to keep him loyal is to fuel his elaborate lifestyle, which while expensive is a small price to pay for stability in Egypt. By throwing some money at him that we would have given to the administration of the colony, he can buy his stuffed birds and big parties with all the wine in the world, and in turn he will do what we say and when we say it. As long as he doesn't do anything insane like bankrupt Egypt he will be kept in power, and our officials can remain in Cairo to control the policy and actual governance that nobody expects him to partake in.

Now, the Ethiopian government spends far too much on educating the natives in things their primitive minds will soon forget, and healing them of every minor injury, and far too little on actually producing anything for Rome. And still, Amadeo demands more money, more soldiers, more help from his home country which has more than enough problems on its own.

Therefore, in order to find a solution to the problem before it even really becomes one, it has been decided to pursue a policy of relocating many of the nonessential Arabs back into the Libyan Desert as a way to keep them out of sight and, as a result, out of mind. This all will be accomplished through incentives and land grants for the willing and forced relocation for those who wish to stay.

The French government, facing rebellion and economic collapse proved unable to control the region beyond a handful of outposts on the coast, and Algeria fell to anarchy. Mussolini quickly recognized the opportunity to further Italian control of the Mediterranean and sent thousands of soldiers and settlers, restoring order and public safety, and adding another jewel to the crown of the Italian Empire. Unfortunately, Italy isn't the only European country interested in Africa, and the Iberian Caudillos have set about expanding their own influence in the region. Now, Algeria is a mish mash of control, with Italy dominant in the desert south and mountainous east, and the Iberians holding the more populated western coast.

First off, we are guaranteed to gain much admiration and respect from Iberia who will now be much more confident in their commitment to the Triumvirate. It will also prevent any conflicts over a useless piece of desert from destroying our nations and possibly causing another world war. And even if we could own all of Algeria, what good would it do us? We would inherit nothing but sand, angry locals that are likely to eventually rise up, and an upset France.

The Turks still constantly complain about the fact that we have control over Crete as compared to them, citing it as a matter of 'national security', totally ignoring that Italy's national security also requires this island. Finally, there is, as there always seems to be, the problem of Atlantropa. The damned thing has ruined the ports of the island, and while there are new ones being built, it is slow and painful.

These ports, once completed, will also turn Crete into a major trading hub, as they will be some of the only fully developed ports in all of the Mediterranean.

As a result, if we wish to keep a hold of Cyprus and its native Greek and Turkish populations, we must send soldiers in to show our presence. Along with the soldiers, we must also increase the supplies and food that we ship to the island so that the people don't starve and can hopefully view us as saviors rather than imperialist animals without regard of their livelihood.

However, refugees are notoriously a rather undiscerning lot, and for the hordes that managed to escape the German Reich during the chaos of the early 50s, any sort of salvation was preferable to death and slavery back home. Even now there have been no definite counts of the refugee population, though the figures likely run while into the millions. Many were initially housed in vast government run camps, while others sought refuge with families or in ethnic enclaves. Though the refugees are relatively few in comparison to the native population and highly concentrated, their presence has greatly incensed our Italian citizens, and serves as one of the main selling points for hardliners in the Fascist Movement. The time has come to more effectively integrate the refugees into the Italian state and society. Ciano proposes to do this with a quota system for Italy's puppets and some of its least favorite provincial leaders, and incentives for the rest. The refugees will be housed (temporarily) at the cost of the state, and given free (mandatory) lessons in Italian language and culture. Naturally, once employed they will be required to pay the government back for its kindness, but they don't need to know that."

And we have a very simple and easy way to remove them, and that is by giving them one week to completely vacate our territory or else be handed over to the Germans to face a fate far worse than death. This may be cruel, and could make us look evil, and may very well alienate all allies or friends we have on this planet, but it must be done to cleanse their filth from our great nation. And besides, we are positive that Serbia and Croatia will be more than happy to take them in, and no problems could arise as a result of this wise and well thought out decision.

The place oozes wickedness and many in Rome can see that the Croatian government cares very little about staying loyal to Italy and her people. Therefore, before anything gets too out of hand, it will become necessary to observe the Croats closely in order to be prepared to take preemptive action as we see fit. A few spies here, a couple of bribed bureaucrats there, and before we know it we shall become aware of every little thing going on inside Zagreb.

One thing is certain, however, and that is that no one is placing bets in favor of the Greek guerillas who still believe they have a chance to liberate their home country.

Indeed, the the residents of the Italian balkans seem far more likely to warn Tito of our actions than to help us find him. Overall, Tito's influence remains relatively limited, but in the context of Italy's economic stagnation, growing dissident problem, and the rending of the Triumvirate alliance, the government has decided that Tito needs to be found sooner rather than later. So the soldiers will go out again, into this strange land. They will visit the same villages, and walk past graffiti proclaiming 'FREE YUGOSLAVIA' on top of graffiti proclaiming 'FREE SERBIA'.

However, after the Second World War ended, most of this land, including Cyprus, the Levant, and parts of Syria, were transferred unto Italy rather than their original owner, much to the anger of Turkish militants. The nationalist regime, led by Alparslan Türkeş, in control of Turkey has, in a not-so-shocking move, claimed most of these colonies as rightful Turkish land. This issue has been a constant roadblock in our nation's relationship even before the creation of the Triumvirate, and has only escalated in recent years. Therefore, we must try our absolute hardest to keep the Turks from trying to press these claims during this years conference in Malta. Even though in our heart of hearts we know there will be no territorial concessions whatsoever, we must keep Turkey in the dark and let them believe that it is still a possibility, if only they wait. We have been laying this reuse upon our ally for a while now, however, and many are doubting our ability to keep them fooled.

And now that our settlers have reached each other, tensions are running high as both countries refuse to back down, with each wanting to own that precious land. And while we have a territorial conflict brewing, Iberia is also upset at the fact that we haven't exactly been paying our dues for the maintenance of the Gibraltar Dam, which acts as a barrier that stops the entire Atlantic Ocean from drowning us. This isn't our fault, however, as economic downturn and general misfortune has left us poor and Iberia relatively well off. All of this could spell disaster if brought up in the Malta conference, so we must make a few offers beforehand as a way to appease them. The easiest thing that we can do is give a little bit of money for the dam, and promise some more money that we don't have and don't intend to pay.

However, Speer is still a Nazi, and while not as bad as the monsters Heydrich and Göring, we cannot just assume everything is alright just yet. There is much work to do, so Italy should begin the process of establishing detente with the German Reich, ensuring peace for future generations. The ties between our nations which were cut during the terrible 1950's must be remade and Italy will have to open her heart just as much as the Germans in order to ensure peace and reconciliation. But that is for tomorrow! Today celebrations, from Palermo to Milan, will erupt as the citizens of Italy can release all the tension of the past decades, all the stress of war with a superior foe, and all the anxiety caused by so much darkness in Europe.

The letter will also hint at other points such as the possibility for full detente and open trade in order to align our two paths in the future, along with official ramifications, such as formally recognizing Speer's regime and showing our support for his legitimacy. Hopefully, the Germans will understand this and see it as the sign to begin creating diplomatic ties with one another in order to ease tensions and bring about a new era of peace. If all goes according to plan, the reply from Germania will have similar meaning and will be the signifier for an escalation of such diplomacy. This will be the first test of many for the new dictator, but if he passes the fate of the world will shift significantly in our favor.

Here they have trained and built up enough defenses that any invasion can be stalled long enough for full mobilization. Due to the insanity caused by the civil war, Italian High Command even increased the number of infantry units as a deterrent to any raids by the combatting parties. Now, In order to send a clear message to Albert Speer and the liberalizing Reich, it would serve our best interests to move the armoured divisions back down South, away from Germany, along with a quarter of the infantry troops. The German government is expected to perform a similar gesture, although not many soldiers are even on our border due to the recent civil war, in which case we will even further withdrawal our forces. The Alpini will stay however, for the German wolf is not to be trusted so easily, and no matter what happens or what Germania says, we aren't taking one damned soldier off of the defensive fortifications on our border with Burgundy.

Not too far from the truth, all things considered. Every newspaper, radio broadcast, poster, and speech has reflected such sentiments, and it hasn't exactly been helpful towards improving our shattered relations. As much as it pains us, the sheer amount of anti-German propaganda is a black mark on Italy in Germany's eyes. If we want any hope of detente with the German Reich, scaling back these barrages of hate would probably be a step in the right direction. At least the government should stop endorsing such propaganda and instead work on more positive messages, like the chance of being friends with Germany like in the old days. We aren't going to censor such messages, however, as Germanophobia is so strong in Italy that doing so would be akin to political suicide, with many of the general populace seeing it as a sign of weakness if we just ignore all the wrongs done upon us by the Reich.

This will involve Italy sending a direct correspondent to their capital, and them sending a correspondent to ours. Also, we also plan on creating a new phone line through the war-torn Germany so that, in emergencies, we will be able to quickly get in touch. One of the primary reasons for these new channels is so that whenever one country is going about creating policies or foreign connection, they will be able to coordinate and consult with the other. This is especially important for Italy, who still feels the betrayal at the hands of the Germans when they created the Gibraltar Dam and drained the mediterranean, against Italy's wishes, and destroyed her economy. It also serves as a signifier to the rest of Europe, specifically to Iberia and Turkey, that Italy is working with the Reich now, and if they are wise they too will engage in the policy of reconciliation.

A ceremony, unmatched by any in history in grandiose and splendor, is being planned to take place upon the opening of the embassy in Germania. The proceedings will be much like those in 1940 when Hitler and Mussolini met, formally bringing us together in the great war in a pact of steel. By participating in these celebrations, it is a way of mending the steel which for so long has lied rusted and bent. While no such announcement of a military alliance will occur, the public will feel like no issues exist between us. Our ambassador has already landed in the Reich, being met personally by Albert Speer and his entourage, and it is expected that our great leader will arrive soon, just in time for the party.

As a response, Italy turned away from the Reich, joining with Iberia and Turkey to form the anti-German Triumvirate. It appeared that Europe was just too small for her two most powerful empires to coexist. But then, Albert Speer took charge of Germany in the civil war. As a result, Italy shifted her policy of aggression into one of making amends, and Germany did likewise. However, not all of our problems have disappeared with Speer's arrival, and they won't for a long time. And while these issues persist, Germany and Italy can't advance from detente into partnership. Therefore, we should start making the public think that things are better than they actually are. This may be deceptive, but how can we improve our situation if our citizens aren't on board? We shall start gradually, with more military withdrawals from the border and mutual festivities, and eventually move onto making promises for economic cooperation and joint armed forces exercises.

But after tonight, we must look beyond Speer and his Germans, at the many problems on the horizon. For although we have walked the path of peace hand in hand with the Reich, not all nations have chosen such a noble venture. Many, Burgundy foremost, would rather see the world burn again, for all the blood-shed of the past is not a lesson that people like to learn, but it may be one that Italy has to teach them! But we can save the world tomorrow, or maybe the next day considering the nationwide hangover that is sure to follow such a celebration."

Now that Scorza's hardline (or even reactionary) faction ended up on the losing side of the Congress, it is time to finally sideline the old guard of the party that still holds resentment towards Ciano, and to cement our vision as the sole, true guiding light for the Party, and for Italy."

How can we appease the students who so often take to the streets, asking for a free press and free academic institutions?

However, there might be a solution. If we could convince the fascists of the PNF to play by democratic rules, we could solve two problems at once - winning over vast swathes of the PNF to Ciano's cause, while also strengthening the nascent democracy. Some members of the party, such as Giorgio Almirante, Augusto De Marsanich and other politicians close to Ciano, have proved receptive to this idea - perhaps, they could form the backbone of a new right wing party willing to engage in a democratic system."

Even Mussolini was a fierce critic of Germany, and we all know that fascism and nazism are completely different ideologies that only allied out of mutual convenience: Italy shall never fall into the claws of that crooked, antisemitic and violent system that has brought so much misery and suffering to Germany, and to all of Europe. We must take every opportunity to condemn these filthy wannabe traitors who lurk among our ranks and would love to see Italy as a subservient puppet of the Reich; we won't just use our propaganda to discredit them, but we shall also expel them from the Party with dishonor and jail their leaders for ideological treason, to make sure that they stop peddling their Nazi poison once and for all!"

Underground communist movements are still present in the country - and after democracy is introduced, we risk a rising tide of radical leftism. However, there is something we can do to amend this - if we allow the creation of a moderate leftist party to compete in the democratic race, we will create a powerful barrier to radicalism.

Many moderate leftists, scared by promises of economic liberalization, are starting to listen to radical socialist rhetoric, and a resurgence of left-wing radicalism is still a haunting possibility. Therefore, we shall officially begin talks and meetings with members of these factions to make sure that the transition towards democracy is a smooth and peaceful one, with constant and open dialogue between the different parties: at all costs, we must avoid all forms of radicalization and extremism among the various factions, and the only way to do this, is by making sure that change of all kinds must come through a slow, moderate and democratic process, not from the barrel of a gun."

However, having a shady, well-funded organization that operates in the darkness and answers to almost no-one isn't exactly a good thing for a functioning democracy: the rumor that many OVRA members have connections with the remnants of the radical factions of the PNF doesn't help.

We shall kindle and foster this flame of optimism and enthusiasm among the people, for it is the people that shall lead Italy into its future, a people that is just about to freely choose its future for the first time, as many of our young and middle-aged have experienced only the fascist regime and the fires of war.

Fascism wasn't a perfect system, but it was necessary for its time: we should strive to change and reform it, but without ever forgetting our past.

However, the attention of the people and of the politicians has been turned to a few, important debates arising in Parliament, and which the Duce simply has to resolve before he can retire. The democratic factions have proposed a final review of the judiciary system, aimed at removing political influence from the judiciary arm of government, while the politicians of the Blocchi Nazionali have set forth an increased budget and the creation of emergency powers for the army in case of serious civil unrest."

For this reason, we must be able to rely on our armed forces, which have always been supporters of Ciano's vision: increasing their budget and giving them more emergency powers should the situation in the country or in the empire go down a dangerous path.

These judges are certain to be a sure threat to Ciano's ability to reshape Italy as must be dealt with before any action is taken. As such, Ciano has to make a decision regarding the integrity of the court and either pack it or replace the justices as he sees fit.

Those military men who distinguished themselves in the heroic struggle against terrorism at home and insurrection in the colonies will receive bonuses in the form of more money: the greater their deeds, the greater the compensation.

Sure, many of these reforms won't even have a real effect on the lives of most Italians, but they sure won't pass unnoticed: the liberals have asked this merely to test just how far Ciano and the other fascists are willing to go, to see if their newfound love for democracy is real or a farce. Immediately, many close advisors to Ciano have criticized these demands as illegitimate, saying that all further liberal reforms should be postponed to after the elections and discussed in Parliament.

As he spoke out to the people, he praised fascism and its glorious history, but also remarked the need for a renewed Italian democracy, one that would lift the country to ever greater heights: the authoritarian elements of fascism were useful in the past but a burden now, and had to be reformed if Italy was to keep its greatness in the future.

Governor general Castellano urges an immediate reaction, potentially one that will be able to repel the Iberians from Algeria entirely. On the contrary, some argue that the Iberians are expecting an Italian offensive, and thus are mobilizing to defend the country - thus, a diplomatic resolution to the crisis is still possible.

By dispatching experienced officers to these spread out units and outfitting them with modern APCs, IFVs and other vehicles in large numbers, we can reorganize them into a decentralized but effective mechanized fighting force, which will allow us to control the vast expanse of the Algerian territory much better than how we could manage using regular army units."

ita_offers_they_cant_refuse_ILG_desc:0 "Over the years, as the influx of Italian settlers in Algeria diminished, the military administration of the territory found itself more and more reliant on native, pro-independence groups to shore up their control of the country, most notably the Front de Libération Nationale. The deal was simple - Italy would allow self governance to natives and put forward vague promises of independence for Algeria in a yet to be decided future, and in exchange the FLN doesn't threaten Italian forces in the region. With a war on the horizon, we can entice the FLN to fight for us by doubling down on our past promises - which in the future we may or may not want to keep."

Organized by the governor of Libya, Italo Balbo, in the 1930s, the Ascari del Cielo were and still are the pride of the Regia Aeronautica, and over the years specialized as an elite unit for desert warfare operations and raids. We shall deploy the Ascari del Cielo in Algeria, and they will be our sharpest weapons in combating Iberian forces - striking behind enemy lines in commando operations to sabotage supply lines and their rear, before disappearing as spectres among the dunes."

As final preparations before we begin our attack, Algerian airstrips will be improved and expanded, with new forward bases being set up to refuel and resupply planes. Our goal will be to cover the entirety of Algeria with our air force, allowing us to launch recon and air superiority missions. Being able to strike anywhere and anytime from the sky will give us the edge we need to kick the Iberians out of Algeria!"

ita_operation_jungurtha_desc:0 "By order of governor general Castellano, all the Italian forces present in Algeria as well as auxiliary troops and militias from the FLN will launch Operation Jugurtha at the scheduled time. The plan envisions a preemptive attack against Iberian positions in the region, catching them off guard with a decisive mechanized offensive backed by air raids and amphibious attacks by frogmen units. The objective of the operation is nothing less than to secure the entirety of Algeria within a short time period, at which point an attempt will be made to force the Iberian government to renounce all claims of controlling the country. The Roman eagle shall spread her wings over the mountains and deserts of Algeria once more."

For this reason, ENI's chairmen has dispatched to Algeria one of his most trusted aides, Mario Pirani Coen. An economist and journalist suspected for his anti-fascist sympathies, Pirani was taken under Mattei's protective wing and made into his right hand man for Algerian affairs. Pirani has numerous contacts within the FLN and prominent diplomats on the Iberian side, especially Portuguese ambassador Alberto Moreira - and has become one of the most outspoken advocates for a diplomatic resolution to the Algerian crisis. By negotiating with Pirani's help, we might avoid a pointless war, and find a much more profitable and convenient solution."

ita_native_diplomacy_desc:0 "While we have managed to find a detente with the Front de Libération Nationale, the main organization advocating for Algerian independence, our relationship is still far from being in any way good or decent. The first step to ensure a lasting peace with Iberia is making sure that the Algerian people is on board with it - many of them see both Italy and Iberia as colonizers, so we must reinforce our promises and commitment to a Algerian independence and democracy. By ensuring the Algerians have a seat at the negotiating table, we'll make the peace process much stronger and easier."

ita_promises_of_freedom_ILG_desc:0 "Our Algerian projects are supported by an important name - Messali Hadj. A long time activist who campaigned for independence when Algeria was under French rule, Hadj is often called the father of Algerian nationalism. After World War Two, Hadj accepted Italian control of western Algeria as a counter to Iberia's expansion plans over the region, especially considering that the Iberian authorities have always maintained a good relationship with the numerous pied noir militias that stalk the country. By using Hadj as the spokesman of our projects to return independence to Algeria, we will be able to gain popularity among the Algerian people, thus increasing our credibility and our clout in the coming negotiations."

ita_for_a_fist_ful_of_oil_desc:0 "To entice the Iberians into sitting at the negotiating table with us, we must use some rather convincing arguments - and oil is the most convincing argument of them all. Only ENI has the industrial and financial power necessary to set up large scale oil extraction infrastructures in Algeria, as Iberia simply lacks the industrial raw power necessary to set up such a large scale operation. The Iberians could cooperate with us, and get a fair share of the oil profits while at the same time avoiding a pointless war."

ita_promises_of_prosperity_desc:0 "As we started flirting with the Iberians regarding the immense profits that could be had by both countries in avoiding a war, it's time to further reinforce this by escalating our offers. While it's true that ENI possesses enough industrial power to set up shop in Algeria, the region would likely suffer from a shortage of workers, as the oil reserves are located in desertic and remote areas. Bringing workers from Italy would be costly and time consuming, but there already numerous Iberian citizens living as settlers in Algeria - by drafting large scale employ plans to allow Iberian settlers to work in ENI wells and pipelines would foster economic cooperations between the two countries, making both richer in the meanwhile."

ita_promises_of_peace_desc:0 "With the Algerian public opinion largely in favor of a peaceful solution to the crisis and numerous voices on the Iberian side now arguing for the same thing, it's time to formally present our plans for a stable peace in Algeria. According to the plan drafted by Pirani and Moreira, and to which the Duce has already consented to, Algeria will be ruled as a joint mandate. European settlers and native Algerians will be both represented in the new government, as Italian and Iberian armed forces will watch over the country - with the long term goal of establishing a free and independent Algeria."

ita_extend_the_olive_branch_desc:0 "The prospect of a war in Algeria simply isn't attractive to us - and we've made it clear to the Iberian side with extremely convincing arguments. In a joint statement, Pirani and Moreira have called for a conference in Palma de Maiorca, with the aim of resolving the Algerian situation in accordance to the mandate plan. We made our attempt to preserve peace in the Mediterranean - we can only hope that the Iberians are as reasonable as we have been."

This must come to a stop, not with tanks and soldiers like the villains that they think we are, but by using our voice to call for order, in true democratic fashion. Giorgio Almirante is of course our man, and in response to these agitators he will make a speech to the country denouncing them and calling for unity. Our hope is that he will be successful, and that these protests will simmer down with a little bit of pressure. After all, simply sending in the military or arresting them would only give them more cause to rise up, fulfilling the prophecy they created in spite of us."

## FUCK THE BN, COUP TIME ##

ITA_Giovanni_De_Lorenzo_DESC:0 "Giovanni De Lorenzo's rise to power shocked many in Italy, but it was far less sudden than one might expect. Born into a family with a long military tradition, De Lorenzo fought with distinction in World War Two before entering the SIM, Servizio Informazioni Militari - the Italian military intelligence service. There, he demonstrated an incredible talent at his job, organizing counterinsurgency and intelligence operations across the Empire - eventually, he was noticed by Ciano, and soon the young general was finally promoted as head of the SIM.\n\nThen, De Lorenzo's true work began. Reorganizing the SIM into an efficient and secretive machine, De Lorenzo did Ciano's dirty work - gathering intel, isolating and destroying political enemies, containing OVRA and other fascist organizations - and playing a key role in Ciano's projects of dismantling fascism, all far from the public eye. With Ciano about to step down, the Duce issued one final order: the Piano Solo. Designed to ensure a quick coup and the installment of an emergency government should Italian democracy enter crisis, the Piano was activated as soon as an attempt to reinstitute fascism was made.\n\nNow, with the King's approval, general De Lorenzo has been named Prime Minister, leading an appointed cabinet tasked with protecting Italian democracy. Saving Italy from herself will require some sacrifices - eliminating hardliners and extremists, restricting freedoms and expanding the armed forces' powers are small prices to pay to ensure that Ciano's vision is realized. Democracy is a word that has many meanings - and in De Lorenzo's mind, democracy must ensure that the many threats of fascism, socialism, and subversion are stamped out, and the people of Italy is united in their devotion to the Fatherland and to the King."

lorenzo.1.t:0 "Knowledge is Power" # The Piano Solo knows many people's connections, opening up these files will help lead to tracking and curbing radicalism
lorenzo.1.d:0 "Giovanni di Lorenzo knew a lot of things about a lot of people. And this would be the basis for Piano Solo, for to know certain things about people's connections was to wield tremendous power over them. Curbing radicalism, at the end of the day, was simply about unravelling these connections and blackmailing whoever needed to be blackmailed to learn more. And once a solid picture was built, Lorenzo would know exactly which pressure points to use to bring a whole edifice of conspiracy and rebellion crumbling to the ground. Perhaps Italy would never know the debt she owed to men like him, or perhaps it would learn of them and look the other way. It did not matter, for the cause was correct. Many would like to think stability is built on the consent of the ruled, but consent was overrated. Fear worked just as well."
lorenzo.1.a:0 "He would know, and he would watch."

lorenzo.2.t:0 "An Air of Formality" # Piano Solo officializes its actions, moves out for a "greater good" to curb radicalism
lorenzo.2.d:0 "To know was well and good, but it was not enough. In order for Piano Solo to achieve its objectives, it would need an air of formality and sufficient official authority to act without being questioned. Of course, everyone involved understood that it would not do to refer to the full extent of the plan out in the open. This would only invite accusations of authoritarianism and subversion. All Lorenzo needed was some measure of official approval, of nods from the right people, and of eyes shut where they needed to be. He also needed men to work with, and this an official status would provide. Then, with the assurance provided to the SIM, he could begin to construct his web."
lorenzo.2.a:0 "Italy would owe them a great debt."

lorenzo.3.t:0 "Approach the Foreign Governments" # Sezione I, connections with other governments, the Piano Solo cannot work alone!
lorenzo.3.d:0 "The Piano Solo cannot work alone. The SIM needed foreign assistance, Lorenzo knew, and he was willing to make such contacts as necessary with the delicacy and secrecy that the situation required. He was not a diplomatic expert by any means, but was informed that the United States of America and Japan had a common interest in the stability of the Kingdom of Italy. They would certainly not hesitate to help Rome curb radicalism and fight subversive activity, whatever it took..."
lorenzo.3.a:0 "Our foreign friends will help us."


lorenzo.4.t:0 "A Quiet Request" # For USA, the SIM is wondering if they can trade information you have on Italians (only yes, its to help their democracy)
lorenzo.4.d:0 "We have been approached, in a manner typical of a delicate request, by the Italian government (or men acting on behalf of it). The Servizio Informazioni Militare, Rome's military intelligence body, has asked to trade information we possess on Italian nationals in return for information they have on American citizens. Naturally we have approved the request, and informed them we would be open to cooperate in future in the interest of European stability and anti-subversive intelligence."
lorenzo.4.a:0 "This will help build Italian democracy."

lorenzo.5.t:0 "A Subtle Request"# For Japan, the SIM is wondering if they can trade information you have on Italians (only yes, its to help their nation)
lorenzo.5.d:0 "With a subtlety not entirely typical of the Italians, the Servizio Informazioni Militare, Rome's military intelligence service, has approached us to request an information exchange. In return for information we possess on certain Italian citizens, they will give us useful information on the whereabouts and activities of Japanese in which we already have an interest. Naturally we have approved the trade, and look forward to further collaboration that will help stabilise and strengthen the Italian state."
lorenzo.5.a:0 "This will help build the Italian nation."

lorenzo.6.t:0 "Watching Industry" # Watchful eyes on those in industrial positions, watching out for left folks
lorenzo.6.d:0 "Lorenzo's training and acquired skills allowed him to see things others did not. Where simple men would look at an industry boardroom or factory line and see people doing their job, Lorenzo could make out a potential subversive from a while away. The socialist menace had never really been washed out of Italian industry, even with decades of Fascist rule, and Lorenzo knew that under the surface lurked a beast waiting to tear the foundation of the economy in two. It was for this reason that industry had to be watched, lists of leftist elements made, and plans for dealing with subversion drawn up."
lorenzo.6.a:0 "The wheel would keep turning."

lorenzo.7.t:0 "Controlling Culture" # Sezione III, controlling culture, extremism is rooted in one's mind from others, blame media, we're controlling it now
lorenzo.7.d:0 "Extremism is not borne out of thin air, out of some combination of individual pathology and external circumstances. Extremism is rather something of a virus, and it spreads above all through culture, which has been far too lenient on subversive thought for far too long. Lorenzo understood that to control a culture was to control a country, and if the media was not willing to police itself, then it would have to be controlled by someone willing to do so. To accept anything less would be to leave the germ of extremism intact, with inevitable results to follow."
lorenzo.7.a:0 "Control what they watch and hear."

lorenzo.8.t:0 "An Unfortunate Accident" # holy shit bro you just anthrax someone because they didnt agree with your take over of the media, cover it up
lorenzo.8.d:0 "An incident has taken place which could potentially harm the execution of Piano Solo should it become public knowledge. A dissident editor, who had voiced very negative views of the SIM's cooperation with the media, has become infected with anthrax. Naturally to imply any involvement from any actor linked to Piano Solo is an absurd provocation, designed by subversive elements to destabilise the Italian social order. Nevertheless, we must now cooperate with the media further to ensure that the story does not spread. Due to the fear unfortunately sparked by the incident, it should not be very difficult to make them see our way."

Merzagora's job is to assure the doubters that whilst such events may have seemed cruel or destabilising, the way forward for Piano Solo is far more benign.

## Italy election loc


itaelections66.1.t:0 "The Start of the Campaign"
itaelections66.1.desc:0 "The Italian people were used to turning on their TVs in the evening and, finally relaxing after a long day of work, watch the amenities that RAI, the state television, usually offered. Exotic documentaries on the remote corners of the empire, thrilling love dramas, and gossip about celebrities and socialites. But this evening, they saw something they had never seen before on TV - a political debate.\n\nIn a modestly arranged television studio in Rome, three men sat on uncomfortable looking plastic chairs, exchanging fulminating looks as a journalist interrogated them on various topics. Answering to a question on his economic program, Aldo Moro, with a slow but determined voice, said - "...we do not say that the state should control all economic activities, but the state, in the complexity of its powers, should not preclude individual initiatives, but it should coordinate, discipline and orient them..."\n\nQuestioned on the more openly socialist points of his agenda, Pietro Nenni, with a fiery and uncompromising tone, answered - "I shall be blunt, socialism is nothing more than to bring forward those who were born in the back ranks!". Finally, Giorgio Almirante, asked about his opinions on fascism and democracy, answered with a sly smile - "I was born and raised under fascism, and I believed in it so much that I excused or ignored all its mistakes. That is my past, our past - we cannot deny it. We should strive to let its valid aspects stay alive." As families and households around Italy had their eyes fixated on their TV screens, everyone, even the children who could barely understand what those three old man suits were talking about, instinctively knew that this was merely the start of something far bigger."
itaelections66.1.a:0 "Moro seems the most reasonable."
itaelections66.1.b:0 "Nenni is right!"
itaelections66.1.c:0 "Almirante's got a point..."

itaelections66.2.t:0 "Women in Politics"
italelection66.2.desc:0 "In a quickly changing world, social roles and convention are often revealed to be much less eternal or unchangeable than they seem. With the recent wave of liberalization, many of the most active members of the new Italian parties and political associations belong to the gentle sex - and their political affiliation may be surprising. Carla De Paoli, director of one of the most widespread BN newspapers, The Italian, has published a heartfelt appeal to Italian women - to reject the siren calls of the rising feminist movement, and rediscover the profundity of the their traditional role as queens of the households and keepers of the hearth.\n\nStill, by far the louder voices come from the left. Lina Merlin, a prominent member of the PSI and a candidate for parliament in the FD, has become the face of the Italian feminist movement, campaigning in favour of egalitarian laws in matters of divorce and inheritance, the full abolition of state-ran brothels, and founding the Unione Difesa della Donna, a lobbying organization reuniting numerous pro-feminist organizations across the country.\n\nThe centre's answer was not long awaited. In a heartfelt speech before a DC rally, Tina Anselmi, a rising star of the Catholic movement, has stressed the need for Italian women to advance alongside the rest of the country, advocating for equal opportunities on the workplace - with fairer wages, more social security, and better schooling directed at women in the rural parts of the country. As many Italian women and girls feel that for the first time they've been given a voice, now the world of politics wonders how they will use it."

itaelections66.2.a:0 "The traditional family must be preserved."
itaelections66.2.b:0 "We must struggle for women's liberation!"
itaelections66.2.c:0 "Equal opportunities benefit not just women, but all of Italy."

itaelections66.3.t:0 "Students in Politics"
itaelections66.3.desc:0 "The young generations have always been politically active in Italy, and as fascism attempted to channel the energy of youth into the Gruppi Universitari Fascisti and similar organizations, Italian university have a tradition of being involved in the country's political life. Predictably, many Italian youngsters were attracted by the promises of liberalization of culture and academia offered by the left, and with Marxist and socialist literature spreading like wildfire, organizations like the Italian Socialist Youth Federation, the Movimento Studentesco, and a plethora of others are swelling their ranks at an impressive pace, and the first rivalries between different strands of socialist and communist ideologues are already starting.\n\nTo every action, corresponds a reaction - and from the right, the reaction did come. Reforming the old GUF and other fascist era organizations, the University National Action Front or FUAN are rapidly gathering under its aegis all the right wing students of Italian universities. Slowly but surely, the influence of the far right on the youth is showing in unexpected ways - in Milano, a sort of somewhat openly neo-fascist youth gang was formed in Piazza San Babila, near the city centre. Watched with suspicion by even the BN, the "sanbabilini" are already starting to be associated with petty crimes and disturbances in the area.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly due to the radicalism and idealism typical of youth, the centre has managed to attract a fair share of young men and women too. Azione Cattolica and other Catholic movements, which even the fascist regime couldn't touch, are now becoming more important than ever - using Catholic strongholds like the University of the Sacred Heart in Milano as their headquarters, it's hard to tell how much of their recent growth is due to genuine conviction or to opportunism on the students' part."
itaelections66.3.a:0 "The youth should engage in the struggle for Socialism."
itaelections66.3.b:0 "The right wing students are united for Italy."
itaelections66.3.c:0 "The Catholic movement shall spread far and wide."

itaelections66.4.t:0 "Minorities in Politics"
itaelections66.4.desc:0 "Italy has always been a diverse place in matters of culture and language, and the annexation of vast amounts of land in World War Two did nothing to ameliorate the issue. Now, in every corner of the country, minority populations are celebrating the return of democracy as the end of fascist oppression, that consistently denied them the right to speak their language and practice their culture. En masse, numerous upstart politicians from South Tyrol to Libya are joining the ranks of FD - and new organizations like Val d'Aosta's Union Valdôtaine, led by Séverin Caveri, and Malta' Partit Laburista, led by Dom Mintoff are allying with the leftist coalition, hoping to secure equal rights and government aid for their communities and regions, often neglected by the fascist regime.\n\nA prominent strand of movements, however, often wary of leftism espoused by FD, have begun gravitating towards DC instead. The most prominent of these are the Südtiroler Volkspartei, led by Silvius Magnago, and the Seznam Slovanov led by Engelbert Besednjak - representing the German and Slavic communities in South Tyrol and the Italian eastern marches respectively. Focusing on economic and administrative autonomy, they often represent the conservative and liberal minded upper and middle classes of their respective regions.\n\nOf course, the Italian right wing immediately saw the various minority movements as a major threat. The Blocchi Nazionali are already launching propaganda campaigns aimed at Italian communities in regions like Trieste, Dalmatia and Libya, decrying the encroachment of minorities against the rights of Italians. Throwing fuel on the fires of the somewhat tense ethnic relations, the BN have begun to sway several Italian communities on their side, and they might have strong electoral results in these frontier regions."
itaelections66.4.a:0 "The peoples of Italy march together for equality!"
itaelections66.4.b:0 "The communities of Italian minorities deserve autonomy."
itaelections66.4.c:0 "These rabble should learn their place."

itaelections66.5.t:0 "The Military in Politics"
itaelections66.5.desc:0 "The Italian military forces have always had a complicated relationship with politics, its ties to government shifting and changing with the times. As Italy is on the path to the elections, many prominent military figures, especially those in the upper brass, have expressed favour for the BN - a party portrayed by propaganda as the great defender of Italian greatness against the rising tide of leftism and foreign interference. The Blocchi Nazionali are spending a great deal of its campaign efforts towards swaying the military electorate and key people to its side, and so far it seems like their efforts are paying off.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that all of the military is in favour of Almirante and his group. A few among the older and more prestigious members of the Italian armed forces, including legendary general and Marshal of Italy Giovanni Messe, are openly proclaiming their support of Democrazia Cristiana. Wisened by age and experience, these veteran generals and officers are wary of the BN's hawkish rhetoric, especially after all the bloodshed of World War Two and the following conflicts that cost so many Italian lives. Proclaiming the need for the Italian army to be used as a force of peace, not war and aggression, their calls are being heard by more and more with each passing day.\n\nA somewhat similar trend has been developing among the common soldiery and younger officers. Also tired of the seemingly wanton way past governments have put the lives of Italian soldiers on the line, many among the lower ranks of the troops have begun to be attracted by the pacifist agenda sponsored by FD, calling for a gradual disengagement from many Italosphere countries and a reduction of military budget. This tendency is still relatively minor, but it might begin to have greater importance in the future."
itaelections66.5.a:0 "We must defend Italy's greatness."
itaelections66.5.b:0 "We should heed Messe's advice."
itaelections66.5.c:0 "We shall set ourselves on the road to peace."

itaelections66.6.t:0 "The Voices of the Workers"
itaelections66.6.desc:0 "The fascist dictatorship harshly repressed independent trade unions, replacing them with state-controlled organizations in which the workers had very little say. Now, as the country democratizes, new unions have risen, usually with a close alliance to one of the electoral coalitions - unsurprisingly, the FD have rapidly managed to make large headways into the working class electorate, and two major unions have now been formed - the Italian General Confederation of Labour, or CGIL, and the Italian Labour Union, or UIL, both supportive of FD. Already gathering a large amount of supporters, CGIL and UIL seem poised to be FD's first line in their struggle for workers' rights.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that the working class has rallied under the socialist banner. The other major trade union in the country, the Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions or CISL, is openly pro-DC, and has managed to gather strong support among the more Catholic minded strata of the working classes. Its bureaucracy and inner workings closely tied to Democrazia Cristiana, CISL enjoys the Church's support and has begun to campaign for resolving the trouble of the working class through dialogue and mutual understanding, letting labour and capital work together for a brighter future.\n\nFinally, there are also a few minor trade unions, much smaller in size, controlled by the BN - most notably CISNAL, or Italian Confederation of National Workers' Unions. Decidedly controlled by the BN, CISNAL doesn't seem to have gathered much following among the Italian workers - indeed, much of the BN's platform regarding this issue has had decidedly anti-union tones, painting CGIL, CISL and UIL as dangerous dens of bolsheviks and as slackers who do not wish to work."

itaelections66.6.a:0 "Workers of Italy, unite!"
itaelections66.6.b:0 "Catholic doctrine shall enlighten the country's economy."
itaelections66.6.c:0 "We can't trust the unions!"

itaelections66.7.t:0 "The Church's Involvement"
itaelections66.7.desc:0 "In a country where the overwhelming majority of the population is Catholic, it should be no surprise that the Church holds a great deal of political influence - this is even more true in Italy's case, as the Holy See itself finds its home in Vatican City, a microstate surrounded by the Italian capital. Predictably, the Church has enjoyed a great relationship with Democrazia Cristiana, the only openly Catholic major party and one which draws its roots into the many Catholic organizations the fascist regime could never quite suppress. Much like the Church itself, DC too oscillates between progressivism and conservatism, as the party has adopted the social teachings of the Church and turned them into a political platform.\n\nDespite the Church's overwhelming support of DC, there are a few dissident members of the clergy that have different ideas. Mostly coming from the lower ranks of the ecclesial hierarchy, priests in major cities of Italy, often those from the most socially and economically downtrodden areas, are more or less openly declaring their support for FD hoping that they will help resolve the many issues of the poorer strata of urban Italian society. As small numbers of Catholic intellectuals also are attracted by FD, it seems like Italian Catholicism might be more red than one could expect.\n\nHowever, the forces of reaction and conservatism are still strong in the Church. In many rural parts of Italy, the local parishes and churches are not merely places of contemplation and worship, but also a focal point of virulent anti-Communist propaganda. Conservatives in the Church, in both the upper and lower ranks, are often wary of DC's reformism and openness to dialogue with FD, and the more national conservative minded areas Blocchi Nazionali are exploiting this wave of reactionary resurgence."

itaelections66.7.a:0 "The Church shall support the Party of Catholics!"
itaelections66.7.b:0 "Jesus was the first socialist!"
itaelections66.7.c:0 "In the name of God, these bolsheviks must be stopped!"

itaelections66.8.t:0 "Minor Parties"
itaelections66.8.desc:0 "While the three major competitors are locked in a deadly race as the elections approach, other, minor parties are also being formed and running their own campaign, hoping to snag a few percentage points of the Italian electorate. However, given Italy's multiparty system, even a tiny party might be able to tip the scales of the political system. One such party is the Italian Liberal Party, or PLI, led by Giovanni Malagodi. A decidedly pro business party, enjoying close tied to Confindustria and other organizations that represent the Italian industrial and economic aristocracy, the PLI has a largely conservative and centre-right platform - and, out of a shared distaste for FD's communism and mistrust for DC's progressive policies, might be drawn to support the BN.\n\nAnother minor Italian party of some importance is the Italian Republican Party, or PRI, led by Ugo La Malfa. A party with an ancient and noble tradition, including several important names of Italian anti-fascists, the PRI calls back to Mazzini's vision for an Italian state - campaigning with a decidedly reformist and progressive platform, balancing liberalism, rejection of communism, and civic nationalism, the PRI has been drawn towards DC, creating a working relationship with the Catholic party out of overall similar agendas.\n\nFinally, a small but certainly very loud party is the Radical Party, led by Marco Pannella. A strongly liberal and pro-civil rights party, loudly campaigning for women's emancipation, anti-racism, homosexual rights, pro-choice legislation and other hot themes of political debates, the Radicals have been drawn towards the FD because it's the only major political force willing to entertain them on such themes - even if, ironically, the Radicals are a staunchly pro free market and economically liberal party."

itaelections66.8.a:0 "We must protect the interests of Italian business!"
itaelections66.8.b:0 "Mazzini's ideals shall guide Italy."
itaelections66.8.c:0 "The people deserve freedom!"

itaelections66.9.t:0 "The Eve of the Election"
itaelections66.9.desc:0 "As the date scheduled for the election approaches closer and closer, bookmakers and analysts, both Italian and international, are drawing their conclusive predictions regarding the new face of Italian politics. The most probable winner, according to early analysis, is the centrist Democrazia Cristiana - a party born out of long-standing Catholic organizations which the fascist regime could never fully dislodge due to their deep ties to the Church, DC is a decidedly centrist party, finding a wide support base among the middle classes, many Italian Catholics, and political moderates.\n\nClosely behind in electoral projections is the coalition known as Fronte Democratico, a leftist big tent gathering numerous organizations to the left of DC. Chiefly formed out of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and the Italian Social Democratic Party (PSDI), FD is the direct continuation of anti-fascist exile and underground organizations, which although greatly weakened by the regime, never stopped being active. The FD receives a lot of its support from the lower classes of society, mainly workers and farmers, as well as students and the Italian youth.\n\nFinally, the underdog of the race are the Blocchi Nazionali, a right wing coalition. Largely formed out of remnants of the PNF, the BN oscillate between conservatism, nationalism, and outright fascist rhetoric. A strongly divided movement kept together by the charisma of its leader, Giorgio Almirante, the BN enjoy support from traditionalist minded regions of rural Italy, former fascist bureaucrats and politicians, as well as a small but very vocal minority of young fascist students."

itaelections66.9.a:0 "DC! Vote DC!"
itaelections66.9.b:0 "Comrade, vote for the FD!"
itaelections66.9.c:0 "If you don't intend to vote for the BN, we have ways to change your mind..."

itaelections66.10.t:0 "Victory for Democrazia Cristiana!"
itaelections66.10.desc:0 "The most widely predicted outcome for the elections has come to realization - Democrazia Cristiana has gathered enough votes to ensure a strong parliamentary majority, with Fronte Democratico a close second. As celebrations are already underway in the many circles and associations affiliated with the party, a smiling king Umberto II has entrusted the candidate of DC, former law professor Aldo Moro, with the position of prime minister of the Kingdom of Italy, asking him to form a cabinet as soon as possible.\n\nIn spite of the DC victory, some internal issues are still to be resolved. The broad voting base of DC inevitably means that numerous different currents have formed inside the party, ranging from moderates and conservatives, tied to the world of the business, finance, and the Church itself, to a much more progressive wing represented chiefly by Moro himself and by his right hand man and ally, Amintore Fanfani. Several issues divide the party, mainly regarding the possibility of a some sort of accomodation or alliance with the Fronte Democratico.\n\nDespite the still somewhat uncertain details of the future Moro government, Italian society has reacted with optimism to the recent DC victory. Confindustria, the Italian confederation of businesses, has expressed their hope that DC will be able to lead to increased prosperity for Italy and its many industries, while everywhere in the country many wonder if DC will be able to keep its promises of improved economic conditions and wages. With all these questions still open, Italy has now entered a new phase of its history - one that is hopefully going to be characterized by peace and democracy."

itaelections66.10.a:0 "Viva la DC!"

itaelections66.11.t:0 "Victory for Fronte Democratico!"
itaelections66.11.desc:0 "The first Italian elections after the end of fascism have resulted in a surprising outcome - by a narrow margin, Fronte Democratico, the left wing coalition, has managed to secure a parliamentary majority. As mass celebrations are taking place, involving Italian students and workers who supported the left, a formal king Umberto has received Pietro Nenni at the Quirinale royal palace, entrusting him with the position of prime minister of the Kingdom of Italy and tasking him with forming a cabinet as soon as possible.\n\nThe victory for FD seems to have taken the coalition itself by surprise, and many are worried that the narrow majority they hold in Parliament, combined with the somewhat shaky nature of the electoral alliance, might spell an early doom for the hopeful leftist group. A congress of the Italian Socialist Party, the dominant force in FD and the party led by Nenni himself, has already been called to find a strategy to solidify the coalition's hold on Parliament. A rising voice inside the party, that of respected politician Giuseppe Saragat, head of the Italian Social Democratic Party, is pushing for an alliance with Democrazia Cristiana, Italy's largest party and main opposition group to FD.\n\nOpposition to Saragat inside FD mainly comes from the leftmost ranks of the PSI, which is rallying around the charismatic Enrico Berlinguer. With various sections of the party threatening to split themselves from FD if their demands aren't met, it is hard to predict what Nenni's tenure as prime minister will look like, but one thing is certain - the Blocchi Nazionali and their affiliated associations have sworn fierce opposition to FD, and have proclaimed their willingness to combat their new government in Parliament and everywhere in Italy. As the Italian people look towards the future with uncertainty, Italy has entered a new phase of its history, the outcome of which is yet to be written."

itaelections66.11.a:0 "Avanti!"

itaelections66.12.t:0 "Victory for the Blocchi Nazionali!"
itaelections66.12.desc:0 "In a completely unexpected turn of events, the first elections in Italian history after fascism have been won by an electoral force closely tied to the former regime - the Blocchi Nazionali. As a somber faced king Umberto II has called Giorgio Almirante, leader of the coalition to the Quirinale in order to entrust him with forming a new government, riots are already taking place in several Italian cities as celebrating rallies organized by the BN are being attacked by angry leftist crowds.\n\nThe Blocchi Nazionali themselves seem to be quite unprepared for this development, and it seems like the coalition is already descending into an identity crisis. While many members of BN are national conservatives, tied to the monarchical institution and the upper spheres of Italian government and economy, a large party of the BN is composed of diehard fascists, most of them coming straight from the higher ranks of the dissolved PNF - chief among them, Almirante himself, leader of the coalition and of the Italian Social Movement, the BN's major party.\n\nAs the Italian streets are already resounding with cries about another fascist takeover of government, Almirante and his men will have to soon figure out how to defuse the inevitable crisis. Rising voices within the BN and the MSI himself, chief of them old statesman and grey eminence of the coalition Augusto De Marsanich, are begging Almirante to renounce its overtly fascist rhetoric and instead find an accomodation with the new institutions, but on the other side a new generation of radical young fascists, such Pino Rauti, are growing more and more influential in the party, and displaying their opposition to any sort of compromise. Still, one thing is certain - Italy has entered a new phase of its history, but it might be not so different from the last one."

 ita.1.t:0 "The Situation of the Italian Empire"
 ita.1.desc:0 "Italy's great gains in the Second World War seemed to promise a new awakening to the broken kingdom. Along with Germany, Italy would ascend to the ranks of global superpowers, masters of the world, the largest empire known since Rome, spanning Algeria to Syria, the Alps to the Horn of Africa. Yet fate is a wind, a gale that changes course at the slightest provocation. When Germany strongarmed Italy into agreeing with the Atlantropa project, the aging Duce Mussolini correctly predicted that the end of the friendship that had conquered Europe, Africa, and Asia was past it's time. The final straw came when the Germans, assailed on what seemed like every side by the resurgent Russians, attempted to force Italy into a war it had no part in. In a fury, Mussolini severed remaining ties with Germany, and as a final insult to Hitler, opened the Empire's borders to Jews, Roma, and any other 'undesirables' hunted by the Nazis.\n\nYet not all was well within the Empire. As the Duce aged, his mind grew more and more erratic, and the Empire nearly fell into infighting as Mussolini privately declared his plans to abolish the monarchy to his son in law, Galeazzo Ciano. Ciano proved himself a hero of the Empire when, against all odds, he convinced the Duce to spare the King, ensuring stability. Not a year later, the Duce died. Galeazzo Ciano was thus sworn in as Duce, and nearly immediately began to liberalize the country, pulling it away from the path Mussolini had taken it.\n\nThough a dedicated fascist, Ciano is an Italian first, and has claimed to recognize the failures within fascism, and promises reforms. Reformists see him as a democrat bringing down a corrupt system from within, moderates see him as a pragmatic fascist doing whatever it takes to keep his home alive, and hardliners, lead by the ideologue Carlo Scorza, see him as a traitor to their ideals.\n\nThe Empire stands on a precipice. Will Ciano succeed in his reforms and bring freedom to the people that demand it so, or will Scorza win out in the end, strengthening Fascism's grip over Italy?\n\nThe winds of fate have left Italy at a crossroads. Whether they take Ciano's road or Scorza's, the country must move forward."

Just when it seemed that the event was over, a soldier approached him.\n\n"Hello there, General dalla Chiesa, it's a pleasure to finally meet you in person". Chiesa turned to look at the voice, a fresh faced young soldier, who's accented Italian easily revealed that he was of native Libyan descent.\n\nHe nodded in response, and asked the soldier why he had decided to volunteer for the war. The soldier smiled before answering "To do the job that only we arabs can do, sending the Turks packing out of Arabia" Dalla Chiesa stared at the man for a second, shocked that anyone would take that sort of tone with an officer.

The jews meanwhile, having suffered in the hands of the Germans and there puppet regimes, want nothing more then to find a new place to call home, and will be up in arms to defend this right. The situation is reaching a breaking point, and unless we take a side, the situation will spiral out of control.\n\nTo this end, we are presented with two opetions. We can either agree to the Arabs demands and close any further settlements. While this will certainly placate the Arabs, we are not sure if it will be enough pacify them. As well as this, the Jews already living in Palestine will certainly not take kindly to this.\n\nSiding with the Israelis on the other hand and telling the Arabs to back off will certainly earn us there ire. While this makes our intents of Jewish nation in Palestine clear, the ractions to this will certainly be varied, and mostl ikely not entirely positive.

#Scorza Crackdown Events#
 scorza.2.t:0 "A Meeting With General dalla Chiesa"
 scorza.2.d:0 "When the war-hero Generale dalla Chiesa was called into the office of Il Duce, Carlo Scorza, he had no clue what he was to be tasked with. After dalla Chiesa saluted his leader and was allowed a seat in one of the luxurious armchairs across the grand desk, he was immediately subjected to a rant about loyalty to Italy and the Fascist Party. He described to dalla Chiesa how as they speak, party traitors are planning a meeting in the city of Verona, a so-called Second Verona Conference, in which they will conspire to overthrow him and push Italy into degeneracy. As he spoke, Scorza went from calm to almost seething with rage as he slammed his fists against his desk. He then gave a simple order to the uneasy general; an order to end this convention through the use of military force by any means necessary. Scorza soon dismissed dalla Chiesa with a proud salute, calling him a trusted friend and loyal patriot.\n\nAs dalla Chiesa left the building, he couldn't help but question the sanity of the order and of Il Duce himself. However, he quickly decided that such thoughts were treasonous, as it was his duty to fulfill the orders to the end. After all, politics is for the politicians and obedience is the role of the army. With that out of mind, he began developing his strategy for eliminating the traitors. After the conference in Verona begins, an armoured military division, veterans of the war with Turkey, will arrive into the town and place it under martial law. Hopefully, they will be able to quickly find the perpetrators, who will be dealt with soon after. Dalla Chiesa sent his plan out to his subordinates that afternoon, while also sending a message to Scorza promising a quick and easy end to the enemies of Italy."
 scorza.2.a:0 "Yes Sir!"
 scorza.3.t:0 "The Descent Into Verona"
 scorza.3.d:0 "The Italian soldiers of the 133rd Armoured Division Littorio wait on the outskirts of Verona, ready to move in whenever the order is given. Although they are preparing to go into an Italian city, they see it as no different from the small villages in the Middle East which they so recently ravaged. They are here, not to protect the people, or to keep peace, but to annihilate the enemies of Il Duce and those who dare defy his authority. The false fascists that flock to the city are nothing more than treasonous rats, ready to be exterminated by the heroes of the empire.\n\nAll of a sudden, the orders are given, and the veteran soldiers begin their march into the streets of Verona. They are escorted by the finest tanks and armoured cars available to the empire, armed with the most modern firearms, and carrying enough ammunition to last a hundred sieges. As they enter the city, families shut their doors, shops close, and mothers herd their children inside in fear of trouble to come. They are only greeted by a small group of policemen who try futilely to deny them entry, claiming the army was violating their jurisdiction, only to be beaten and arrested. The soldiers soon reach the center of the town, and as if in some statement of their authority, set up their headquarters in Castelvecchio, or the old castle, which acted as a military fortress in the Middle Ages. The mayor of Verona, after receiving a personal letter from Il Duce himself, has given a speech to the residents announcing that the army is taking control in order to promote safety, and must be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\n\nHe was found dead the next day, the official cause being traitors poisoning his wine."
 scorza.3.a:0 "For Il Duce!"
 scorza.4.t:0 "The Streets of Rage"
 scorza.4.d:0 "The soldiers of the 133rd have had more and more trouble simply maneuvering the streets of Verona due to massive amounts of protesters blocking their path. The foot troops have much difficulty trying to march, and the tanks and trucks have been sitting still for hours. The protesters, who appear to be mostly young adults and students, are against the army imposing martial law in the city. By blocking their movement with barricades and their own bodies, the students believe that they can stall the soldiers for just long enough that Rome would recall them out of frustration.\n\nThey were wrong\n\nBy now, the soldiers were getting annoyed. As they became restless, the officers in command began rationalizing that the protesters were just as traitorous as the men they were brought here to put down, so the students must be treated as enemies of the state. Soon after such discussion, the citizens that were safe behind locked doors gasped as they witnessed hundreds of their fellow Italians being beaten senseless by the aggravated infantrymen. Tanks roared to life, unafraid of rolling over anybody foolish enough to stand in their way and advanced forward. No one stands in their way anymore, and the occupiers are now free to fulfill their duty to Italy and Il Duce."
 scorza.4.a:0 "Get Out of the Way!"
 scorza.5.t:0 "Capturing the University"
 scorza.5.d:0 "The University of Verona is the center for all young intellectuals in the city, and as such, represents a thorn in the military's side. After dealing with the protesters in the streets, it became evident that something drastic had to be done in order to end any opposition activity at once. So it has been decided that they shall march on the college and force the people that consider it a safe haven to see the might of Italy. As the trucks rolled out into the courtyard and the soldiers deployed in the hallways, the students actually attempted to put up a fight! By using stones and sticks, the young adults sought to deter the invasion. The soldiers responded by firing machine guns into the crowds, mowing down all who were foolish enough to oppose them. Even when they started to run, there was no mercy as the soldiers chased them down and either beat or shot them.\n\nUpon hearing the news of the capture, Scorza is said to have turned bright red, for the University of Verona was founded by him just a few years ago. Scorza soon ordered that the actions of the army be covered up by the media, as any knowledge of what happened would surely end with him being thrown out of office. But it had to be done, for the stability of Italy."
 scorza.5.a:0 "It was necessary..."
 scorza.6.t:0 "Dealing With the Survivors"
 scorza.6.d:0 "A few of the young protestors in the university have managed to barricade themselves in the dormitories, scared of facing justice. As they were called on to surrender, the cowards merely stayed silent. Therefore, it was decided to burn the building and shoot anybody who wants to escape.\n\nAs the flames burned and the residents screamed, the soldiers stood guard and watched. At this point, they realized that they were in a warzone, just like the Middle East. They were here to fight and to kill the enemies of Italy, and they were to go about it the only way they knew how. As the bodies roasted, the soldiers sang and lit cigarettes, utterly disregarding the hell around them."
 scorza.6.a:0 "They made their choice"
 scorza.7.t:0 "Crushing the Protestors"
 scorza.7.d:0 "Today the 133rd has reached another group of protestors who were trying to block the tanks and trucks with their bodies in a feeble attempt at resistance. As the weapons loaded and the soldiers faced the protestors with weapons at the ready, the young rebels didn't flinch. They held banners telling them to go home, and held torches that have began to symbolize the people of Verona who oppose the army's actions in the city. A standoff was taking shape, and as an officer warned the people to disperse, they simply yelled back petty insults. At this point, the officer gave up and ordered the 133rd to open fire.\n\nThe turrets of the tanks fired shells that destroyed buildings, and rifles cut down the screaming rioters. The protesters were cut down like wheat at the harvest. As the army advanced, they began firing at not just those with banners and torches, but anybody they came across. Everybody there became guilty of association, even children, and the punishment was death.\n\nAs news of these events reached the ears of city officials, they realized that the city really was a victim of invasion. As such, a secret order was passed down to muster a militia consisting of policemen, veterans, and young men to try and repel the occupiers. It was clear the military was seeking a fight, and Verona was prepared to give them one."
 scorza.7.a:0 "Open Fire"
 scorza.8.t:0 "Breaking Through"
 scorza.8.d:0 "The Second Verona Conference has began in a small bar in the center of town. The council of reformers, although scared for their lives, refused to cancel such an important event. And now they have the Verona militia guarding them, made up of young and old residents of the city who are armed with old rifles and makeshift explosives. If and when the army comes to put an end to the conference, they will have to battle the people of Italy who stand against tyranny and oppression. They will wage war with those they swore to protect, and they will spill the blood of their brothers.\n\nAs expected, the military came to put an end to the treason. And when they encountered an armed militia, they didn't even hesitate to put them down, each and every one. If a sniper was in an apartment, the tanks simply leveled the building. When an improvised explosive was encountered, they forced the onlooking civilians to walk through and clear the path. Even as the treasonous rats fired back and killed some of the brave sons of Italy, the soldiers only grew more angry. Entire stores burned, and ancient churches dating back hundreds of years crumbled into dust. The wrath of the 133rd was unmatched, and they slaughtered their way to the building where the true traitors lay, conspiring against Il Duce. There, they wait for the order to end this, once and for all."
 scorza.8.a:0 "Onward, we will make them pay"
 scorza.9.t:0 "At the council"
 scorza.9.d:0 "Even before the soldiers had knocked down the door and entered the meeting room, the council knew it was over for them. Some shot themselves like cowards, afraid of the justice they deserved, while others cried. When the traitors were confronted, however, they said nothing and did not try to escape or bargain. The army quickly apprehended them, only to discover that one had a bomb hidden under his coat, ready to deliver one last message of resistance. Luckily, fate blessed us this day and the explosive failed to go off. In order to make sure no such things happen again, the officers decided to forgo a trial and ordered a quick execution. They were left in the building as the soldiers barricaded the windows and exits and lit the building on fire. Forgetting that it was a bar, the army quickly departed as the alcohol caused a rapid combustion, leading to surrounding buildings burning. The flames spread and spread, and eventually most of Verona was aflame. The 133rd evacuated the area before any harm could come to them, and and one commander made a remark stating that the burning of Verona was justice for the city's betrayal of Scorza and Italy."
 scorza.9.a:0 "We did what was necessary..."
 scorza.10.t:0 "Opening Your Eyes"
 scorza.10.d:0 "As the fires burn on, everybody watches. The citizens of Verona weep, only able to run away, leaving their houses, jobs, and lives just to protect themselves. The city officials weep, unable to fight the fire as all resources and water systems are gone by the hands of the army. Even the soldiers, now able to see the hell that they have created, can no longer find justice in their actions. In Rome, the few high ranking government officials that have knowledge of the military's actions now see who Carlo Scorza is, and what his intentions are for Italy.\n\nAn anger is burning brighter than the flames engulfing Verona, as everybody who can see the reality of what happened now boil with rage. The false dictator who labels himself Il Duce is nothing more than a coward, and his actions have seen nothing but pain and suffering. His opponents will remember this. The soldiers will remember this. The victims will remember this."

 scorza.11.t:0 "The End"
 scorza.11.d:0 "The fires have died out, and two thirds of the city is now ash. Even before the flames died, all sorts of government workers have flooded the area under the guise of humanitarian work. The truth is, they are mostly fabricating excuses and creating stories to justify the disaster and the numerous massacres committed by the Italian military.\n\nRome's official response to the international outcry has been that the city was plotting against the state and Il Duce, and as such, had to be put down. When the army came to enforce the peace, the civilian population rose up and declared rebellion. The military acted justly and with proper authority in handling traitors to the state.\n\nBut regardless of opinions, speeches, or the lies of Scorza, the truth can be found in the hundreds of butchered citizens and thousands of burned bodies buried in the rubble. The orphaned children and abandoned hospital patients could speak of the terrible atrocity committed by their own people, if only anybody would listen. However, it appears that they shall remain buried, looked over, and neglected by a blind populace and a cruel dictator."

 scorza.12.t:0 "Breaking the Shore"
 scorza.12.d:0 "Our Fourth Shore, consisting of Libya and Tunisia, is the Empire's most proud possession. Every loyal Italian sees the land as equally important and necessary as the main peninsula itself, and many in Rome know that it is the cornerstone for our colonial empire. The residents of the fourth shore, however, do not hold the same views and instead feel that they are better off without us! They instead believe in ideals of autonomy, local rule, and other such liberal nonsense. This absurd notion must be put down immediately, and our ever loyal general dalla Chiesa is the man for the job.\n\nThe plan is simple, land soldiers and tanks in the colonies, shoot anybody who disagrees with our glorious leader, and burn any villages supporting the rebellion. Our navy will stand ready and threaten any foreign nation attempting to support the traitors, and our air force will obliterate them from above. As our brave men move alongside the coast and clear out the rebels, we can replace the incompetent governors with new people entirely loyal to Il Duce. And, when complete, we shall double the local garrison to ensure future revolts never even occur.\n\nAlready, our boys are landing on Libyan beaches and arriving into the dockyards, ready to serve their nation. Photographers and cameramen follow them, taking pictures for use in propaganda. The tanks will arrive later today, and with them, we will move onward, crushing the rebel scum under our tracts. No one will escape the wrath of Italy!"

 scorza.13.d:0 "Our glorious leader, Carlo Scorza, still has many political opponents in our capital, and due to recent events many of them are forming together to push him out of office. Through political connections and popular support these traitors pose a serious threat to the regime and must be silenced quickly. Luckily, the military has chosen to support Scorza in full, and already many of the local divisions are moving into Rome to secure the city. Hoping to avoid another Verona, the goal is to eliminate the use of vehicles and tanks and instead use ground soldiers to accomplish our task. By arresting and executing these rats, Scorza will finally be free to rule Italy as he sees fit, without anybody telling him otherwise.\n\nThe opposition has consolidated around many members of the lower house of Parliament, and as such it will be a good move to shut it down and arrest anybody suspected of treason. Special forces have been deployed to handle the delicate matter, and are expected to come into contact with the troublemakers soon. If all goes to plan, this maneuver will be smooth and simple, and little blood will be shed. As a bonus, hopefully the people will not be aware of our actions, as such matters are far too sensitive for them to understand.\n\nOnward, brave sons of Italy! Protect Il Duce and the Empire for which he stands!!"
 scorza.13.a:0 "Get them out of here, get them the hell out!"
 scorza.14.t:0 "Laying Down the Law"
 scorza.14.d:0 "The elite forces were shocked by the presence of Scorza himself when they began to advance onto parliament. Il Duce greeted him there with a smile, stating that he must look into the eyes of those who wish him gone as they are judged for their crimes. It was decided that him and his personal guard of blackshirts will storm the Chamber of Fasci after the soldiers clear out the building.\n\nAs the barricaded doors blew open, Il Duce emerged with his entourage. He moved up to the floor, with the confidence of a Roman general, and gave his speech. He denounced the treasonous activity and gave every member the last chance to declare their loyalty for the Empire and be spared his wrath. All the people there chose not to bend the knee, and instead sat in solidarity, unwilling to give the dictator the satisfaction. In disgust, Scorza gave them one last mercy; a chance to plead their guilt and have the honor of being able to execute themselves. When again, no one moved, Scorza began screaming at them in rage, announcing that they would all be put down like dogs. The soldiers raised their guns, and when Scorza gave the order, fired round after round into the crowd. It was then, when being massacred that they began to beg for his mercy.\n\nBut it was too late, as Il Duce no longer had any."
 scorza.14.a:0 "You fought the law, and we won"
 scorza.15.t:0 "The Coverup"
 scorza.15.d:0 "Now that the traitors are dead and Italy is saved, it is time to wash the blood off of our hands and pretend that nothing happened. Through a combination of false charges and convenient accidents, we have been able to sweep everything from the massacre in Rome to Verona under the rug. Everybody who knows the truth is absolutely loyal to Il Duce, and if any future incidents occur we know that the military has our backs. The people may not view us in the most positive light, but for now they support us. Scorza has the nation of Italy, and Italy has Carlo Scorza, for better or worse.\n\nOur atrocities must never be leaked, never be whispered in the shadows, and never told in a tavern after a few too many drinks. The punishment for even discussing these actions is death to the perpetrator and their family. We are on thin ice, and it only takes one idiot to make the cracks swallow us up, for what we did in Rome, in Verona... is unforgivable. If they only knew, our heads would be on pikes and Italy would be engulfed in chaos.\n\nWe must bear our burdens, and bear them we shall as we make Italy into the great nation it was intended. "
 scorza.15.a:0 "The realities of what happened here shall be buried, no matter the cost"
 scorza.16.t:0 "The Truth Revealed"
 scorza.16.d:0 "It can't be... it just can't.\n\nNewspapers all over the world bear the headline SCORZA MASSACRES THOUSANDS. World leaders condemn us to hell for our actions. The people cry for revolution. Somebody somewhere has released files connecting us to all of our crimes, and already the world is burning around us. Scorza himself has released a televised speech denying the accusations, but the evidence is damning. The cracks are spreading, and everybody is holding their breath.\n\nThe military is already declaring martial law in a few cities witnessing intense protest, and many police stations are cracking down, and hard. Colonials all across the Empire are stirring in anger, and the populace is screaming for retribution. It appears that there isn't enough support for a total revolution, so Scorza is safe for now with the army at his side.\n\nWe have made a terrible mistake, and now it is time for us to pay. May the mercy that we failed to show our enemies be granted upon us."

 ita.44.t:0 "A Tense Meeting"
 ita.44.d:0 "Our Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, recently returned from a meeting with key leaders in the Grand Council of Fascism in an attempt to sway them to his reformist agenda. Specifically, he targeted the bloc of old, hard-line fascists who either abstatined or refused to confirm him as Duce at the Verona Conference. Despite his best efforts, however, the Duce was unable to convince them to support him now.\n\nSpeaking to press a few hours after the meeting concluded, Ciano did not mince words. 'These gentlemen seem to be unable to accept that the world is changing around them. What worked in 1921 will not work today, and the solutions needed to fix our immense problems can not be found by looking into the past - but forward into the future.'\n\nCarlo Scorza, leader of the anti-reform block had no good words for Ciano either. In a leak of a speech to the Council obtained by the press, he denounced Ciano as a 'buffon' and a 'decadent, weak man unfit to fill the shoes of our first Duce'."

 ita.45.d:0 "While Ciano's attempts to sway the hard-line fascists were less than successful, it appears his efforts with the new Christian Democrats seem to be making more headway. In a public meeting with party leaders Amintore Fanfani and Aldo Moro, Ciano was eager to show of his successes.\n\n'These two gentlemen right here are the future of reform in Italy!' he said to a camera, smile beaming. 'They are proof we can improve the condition of working people while staying true to our Christian roots and values.' Moro and Fanfani were similarly pleased with Ciano: 'When Mussolini passed away we were fearful for the future. We were worried we would turn into a mirror of Germany - a chaotic power struggle at the top and no care for the working people at the bottom. With Ciano in charge, our fears were laid to rest.'"

Quoted as saying that fascism is the 'lifeblood of the nation', readers have interpreted this as Scorza harkening for a return to the days of Mussolini style fascism, and to reverse the liberalisation currently in motion in Italy.

They vary wildly, however the government has whittled it down to four choices given to our Duce to decide upon.\n\nThe First one is a film detailing a brave last stand of Italian soldiers against Ethipopian savages during the second Italo-Abyssinian war. The second is a telling of the March on Rome, the foundation of fascist Italy, and the saving of it from decadent democracy and godless socialism. The third is a film covering one of Julius Caesar's finest battles, the battle of Alesia in Gaul, showing Italy in its glory days and the importance of a strong leader to bring victory and glory to Italia. The final film is one detailing an Italian battle on the Eastern Front, where a brave group of Italian soldiers fight alongside their less than able German allies.\n\nThe chosen film is expected to take 6 motnhs to complete. The producers await the respone from the Duce."

Set during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the movie tells a tale of an Italian company that accidentally wanders into Ethiopian territory during a storm, and are besieged by the natives when their mistake comes to light.\n\nThe film proceeds to depict acts of heroism and selfless sacrifice on the Italians part, and acts of savage cruelty by the Ethiopians towards their Italian captives and eachother. The film has shocked audiences with its intense battle scenes and brutal reality, and one scene in particular, showing a vengeful Italian Bersaglieri gunning down dozens of Ethiopian conscripts in close range, has been reported to cause unwitting audience members to even faint!\n\nThe battle ends with the Italian company standing victorious, as the commander of the unit, played by the promising young Modenese tenor Luciano Pavarotti, orders his subordinates to form up and prepare for a march back to Italian lines. The final scene of the movie shows the triumphant company marching towards the sunrise, roused by Pavarotti's example into singing "Giovinezza".\n\nAlready considered a classic, this film is sure to linger in the minds of the youth for a long time to come."

Fascism has become normal.\n\nIn their search for ways to rebel against their families, their communities and authority in general, Italian youth is falling prey to the influences of radical movements seeking to destabilize the status quo.

The Blackshirts have failed to make any effort in changing with the times, which has resulted in the population seeing them as a relic of a more turbulent time in history. As a result, many have stopped participating in meetings and rallies, opting to spend their free time in ways they have seen to be more productive.\n\nWhile this is bad news for the Blackshirts, there will always be die-hard fascists keeping the organization alive.

Today, workers of Rome have announced they will be organizing a march to Piazza del Popolo Square, and a press statement there to state their options on the Conference and their demands from it. So far it seems to be a harmless protest, while we are guessing it is organized by an underground socialist movement, that can contribute to the Conference as an option, we are yet to see how it will turn out."

After the Workers announced their protest, Black Brigades immediately announced their 'counter-protest' against the 'reds' and 'will not let them run riot in Rome'. Their implications are obvious, and the mix of Black Brigades and worker protesters is the perfect Italian recipe to create a street fights and riots. We can use this announcement forbid workers from protesting, justifying it by security concerns, or we can let them do their protest under police supervision and so avoid satisfying Farinacci with our compromise."

It gone much better than expected, no plunder, no vandalism, just a peaceful march to Piazza del Popolo square. This of course can be referred to our vigilant police's watchful eyes, as the security is high. Currently workers are giving their statement to the press, and protest will end after it. So far no signs of Black Brigade activities, so everything goes exactly as planned: a successful and peaceful protest for all our nation, and a disgrace for Farinacci."

Panicked masses tried to flee and scatter, but they were too numerous and started to stampede each other like a herd of buffalos being attacked by hungry hyenas. Death toll is 53 now, and more and more corpses being found every hour, and wounded people are over 500. Tens of houses and shops being damaged even looted, there are even reports of rape and murders unrelated to the riot, being done by taking advantage of chaos it caused.

All of this proves one simple fact; The fascists claims of glory and power are nothing but one great lie!'\n\nThis quote came from a radio broadcast that was deliverd by the King of Italy, Umberto the Second, this morning. The king, long believed to have harbored resentment against the Fascist party for stripping away his power, has taken advantage of the current situation to demand more power for himself.

It would appear that he is exploiting the opportunity posed by this chaos in order to permanently freeze this thawing of Italian society.\n\nWhile Il Duce would have normally been able to simply brush this off, the current political crisis has left him dangerously vulnerable.

 ita.915.t:0 "Italy Denounces Göring's Reign"
 ita.915.d:0 "Immediately after news arrived in Rome about Hermann Göring's victory in the German Civil War, the Italian government began preparing for the worst. The orders were given, and all branches of the government have been doing everything in their power to address the likely conflict with Germany. It is apparent that the we must begin preparing for a fight through rapid mobilization and defensive planning. Nearly everyone is scrambling to assess and evaluate the situation and enact these policies as quickly as possible. This morning, a statement has been passed onto the media by authority of the Italian government saying that "The Italian Empire is once more at threat from the German regime, now lead by the war-mongering dictator Hermann Göring. He has shown no respect for the sovereignty of nations throughout Europe, and has shown a willingness to engage in war in order to achieve nationalistic goals against the benefit of the common good. Even now he prepares to once more bring blood-shed with his aggressive posturing and accusations against Switzerland, Sweden, Hungary, Romania, and others. Italy will not stand by and allow for darkness to fall upon the continent once more, and we are prepared to address any aggression towards the people of Europe as aggression to Italy herself. The Italian Empire is now asking all foreign states to stand in solidarity with her against the German Reich. She asks for all who wish for peace to put aside their grievances with one another in order to dissuade the Reich from taking any more aggressive action. And specifically, she reaches out to Iberia and Turkey for renewed cooperation against the German menace."
 ita.915.a:0 "We must come together."

 ita.916.t:0 "Italy Reestablishes Connections to Iberia"
 ita.916.d:0 "Today, an Italian diplomatic envoy arrived in Madrid to meet with the Iberian government in an attempt to reconcile with their former ally. They hope to show Iberians that they both stand in Hermann Göring's sights and are likely to be soon invaded by the German war machine and, whether or not that is true, it is important that good relations are necessary for the safety of Atlantic shipments. The Italians believe that mutual cooperation will be the best course of action in diverting conflict, and that working together will ensure the two nation's mutual survival in the face of this new threat, even if they aren't too keen on making friends with the Iberians. Although Italy feels that the only sane option for Iberia would be to work together again, the diplomats exiting the first meetings have been left with mixed feelings about the whole affair. This is due to the Iberians asking hard questions about the Gibraltar Dam payments, the Italian Empire's inability to keep the Triumvirate alive, and general bickering between the Spanish and Portuguese representatives over even the most trivial detail. To all of this, the ambassadors had little to reply with. Rome is currently praying that Iberia will advance negotiations and come to some sort of agreement with them. "
 ita.916.a:0 "Let's hope they can swallow their pride for once."

 ita.917.t:0 "Italy Reestablished Connections to Turkey"
 ita.917.d:0 "After the recent war between Italy and Turkey, Italy cut of all diplomatic ties with Turkey. This has been the status quo until recently, when an envoy from Rome arrived in Ankara in reaction to Hermann Göring's victory in the German Civil War. The Turks were not surprised at us reaching out and have already allowed the ambassadors to re-occupy the abandoned embassy. Anti-Italian hostilities still run rampant throughout the nation, however, and the diplomats have had to be escorted in bullet-proof cars and be given personal bodyguards by Turkey when out in public. Angry citizens throw bottles at their lodgings and scream for them to leave and never return, while the streets are packed with protesters vehemently opposed to their presence. The Turkish government has had a different view of the diplomats, seeing this as an opportunity to protect themselves from the openly malicious Germans, but are stuck in a hard position in which if they accept Italian cooperation, they will lose massive support from the local populace and if they refuse to negotiate they leave themselves vulnerable to Nazi invasion. They have so far been supportive of Anti-Italian policies as a means of gaining political support but taking such a stance here would certainly be suicide in the long run. As a response to this delima, the Turks have agreed to allow for the Italians to stay but have been unclear about any further action. Although not entirely successful, the envoy still rejoiced at reconnecting with their former ally turned foe."

No nation has ever been able to truly placate them and even the great Empire of Italy suffered at their insolence during the Second World War. But now, we have an amazing opportunity, a chance to use them to our advantage! With some outreach and old weaponry dating back decades, we are sure that the Balkan region can be turned into a meat grinder able to both terrify and annihilate German divisions under Göring and his buffoons. The new Führer may have his nuclear arms and other wonders of science, but now we can harness our own secret weapon in the shape of insane partisans. Already, the Italian government has started strengthening ties with Croatia, Serbia, and others in an attempt to show that the Italians are friendly and willing to work together to repel any foreign threats. The response and leveling degrees of mutual cooperation between these nations and Italy in the future are completely unknown, but the military has already begun making connections of their own with rebel groups, nationalist organizations, and pretty much anybody we have struggled with in the past. This probably won't end well, but let's just hope that they and the Germans wear each other down enough for Italy to survive and perhaps maintain their hegemony. One can only dream, afterall."
 ita.918.a:0 "Let the Nazis learn what true savagery is."

 ita.919.t:0 "Italy Reaches Out to The OFN"
 ita.919.d:0 "It is no secret that any nation, dictator, rebel, or person opposed to the Germans and Japanese can be given a blank check by the Organization of Free Nations, lead by the United States. That being said, we have sent our best sweet talkers over to Washington D. C. to get funding and equipment. Any and all help from America will be essential to our success in a war with Germany. However, there have never been great relations between our two nations, who were technically at war during the 1940's, although no fighting broke out between the two. And due to America being a democracy, their response can be unpredictable. Who knows how Uncle Sam will respond to possible involvement in another foreign war? And there is always a sense of anxiety when nations with nuclear stockpiles clash. In the end Italy is still optimistic about American support and entirely dependent business connections there. The United States has generously arranged meetings to discuss our mutual interests over the coming week. We are poised to make great headway in negotiations and everybody in Rome is depending on good news. Besides, how can they resist good, old-fashioned Italian charm?"
 ita.919.a:0 "We'll make them an offer that they can't refuse."

 ita.920.t:0 "Italy Engages Talks With The East Asia Co Prosperity Sphere"
 ita.920.d:0 "In the face of war for survival against the Nazi hordes lead by the tyrant Hermann Göring, any and all outside help will be crucial. This is why we sent multiple agents over to the Japanese Empire in an attempt to gain any and all support possible. Japan may not seem like the most obvious choice, or even a good one, they are always trying to damage the Germans in any way possible, especially now that Göring's in charge. Our first step was to contact the Chrysanthemum throne, although any beneficial response is unlikely. That is exactly why the majority of or resources will be devoted to lobbying the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy. It is expected that the navy and army will both see honor in our cause, however anything is possible and they may not be in a position to provide actual support aside from a few statements. And if the navy or army found out we were courting the other, they may both become bitter and completely stop all talks. Unlike the OFN, nobody in Rome is expecting anything spectacular from the isolationist state. But if they did align with us, it might be enough to shift the odds in our favor in an upcoming conflict."

 ita.6000.d:0 "Lately, high ranking police officers and detectives have noticed something...odd. Across the country, there seems to be a wave of a particular type of crimes. Specifically, some armories and banks have been robbed across the country, with the perpetrators disappearing with their hands full of guns in the former cases, and of money in the latter. Such things would be considered somewhat normal, but there seems to be a pattern in place. At the same time, agents have reported that FD members and supporters have been intimidated or beaten up. We know for sure that the Brigate Nere are no more and that Farinacci's dead, but after frisking a suspicious student outside an university in Milan, policemen found a gun that had been recently stolen and a flyer containing propaganda for an organization or group called "NAR". So far, our policemen agree that these groups are probably just a small remnant of the Brigate Nere of old, and it's highly unlikely that they could be in any way connected to the recent robberies. Still, this situation will have to be monitored, if we want political violence to remain a memory of the past."
 ita.6000.a:0 "We have bigger fish to fry."
 ita.6001.t:0 "A Slight Issue"
 ita.6001.d:0 "At this point in time, the redistricting maps for our first election have been drafted and the careful process of apportioning seats has been completed. Or at least that is what we thought, as it appears that the state of Benito has been completely forgotten, meaning that all of our calculations are off and the state isn't factored into the overall election. Even though the desert state has a remarkably low population and is a rather embarrassing part of our empire, its people still have a right to vote for the Italian leadership fairly. How such an idiotic mistake could happen is currently baffling Rome, as it now appears that we will have to completely start the process over from scratch, from the bottom up, to ensure that these elections can be completed with every state having the ability to vote equally. This entire process hopefully won't delay the elections, but it will cost us a large sum of money to fix this simple mistake. Worse yet, many are even considering just abandoning Benito as a cheaper alternative, something that would surely cause massive outrage and set a dangerous precedent.\n\nThis is just a small part of a much larger problem, which is that the Italian Empire has very little experience in running a democracy and our bureaucrats are overwhelmed with the stress of putting on elections. The general confusion that has taken hold of the government has left us with a quite disorganized, sloppy mess with problems ranging from non standardized ballots to forgetting an entire state. Even Ciano himself seems to be in over his head as he begins to realize how difficult this process is going to be. These are rather trying times, but if we can somehow make it through these elections we should be much more prepared for the following ones to come. Let's just pray that our streak of bad luck will end and it will be smooth sailing from here on out. "
 ita.6001.a:0 "How? How do you just forget an entire state?"
 ita.6002.t:0 "Bruno Visentini Gives a Speech"
 ita.6002.d:0 "Being a minor party, nobody in Italy believes that Bruno Visentini and the Partito Repubblicano Italiano can win these elections. Determined however to give it his best shot, Visenti has decided to go full throttle and go for the victory. Today, as an attempt to get the people on his side, he has travelled to the University of Bari to give a speech to the students and encourage them to vote for him and his party.\n\nHe delivered his message in a small conference room on campus, with an audience of less than fifty people present and only one reporter, who was half asleep. Not to be discouraged, Visenti spoke with his usual energy, proudly exclaiming that he saw no reason why a little party like his couldn't win seats in Parliament and why even the people in that room could make all the difference. Ever smiling, he even answered questions directly asked by the audience, being caught off guard by how difficult they were. But even when asked why he even bothered running, he exclaimed proudly that he definitely won't win if he doesn't try. After talking for a bit more and making some awkward jokes that didn't quite land, he ended the speech with his new slogan of "Go we go", which he tried to get the crowd to chant with him, unsuccessfully.\n\nAs if not embarrassed enough, when Visentini turned around he noticed a portrait of Aldo Moro, his rival leading the Christian Democrats and apparently an alumni of the university, hanging behind the podium he was speaking at. And yet, even though he began to feel discouraged, he kept smiling as he left, unwilling to let down his party and the Italian people."
 ita.6002.a:0 "Go we go! Go we go!"
 ita.6003.t:0 "Early Polling Presents an Odd Phenomenon"
 ita.6003.d:0 "As part of our attempts to get a good idea as to how these elections will turn out, we have commissioned polling associations to go from town to town to randomly select individuals and ask them who they planned on voting for. The results are still mostly being processed and will likely be only available a few days before the elections themselves, but we have discovered one alarming trend.\n\nIt appears that in Sicily, especially in the regions scattered with old people's homes and retirement communities, there has been a shocking number of citizens declaring that they want Benito Mussolini to win in the coming elections. Apparently, the old Duce was still quite popular and even the fact that he was deceased was not enough to keep him out of politics. When confronted about why they would choose a candidate from beyond the grave, the elderly voters either were confused and thought he was still alive or were just in plain denial that he could ever not be Duce. While the numbers were nowhere near high enough to actually influence the election results, this does show one of the very flaws in democracy that ironically the fascists have targeted for decades, in that some people are simply too ignorant to choose their own leaders, and yet these ignorant people seem best drawn to the fascists who most lack respect for them.\n\nIn any event, this odd situation has become quite a joke around Italy, with pranksters making fake campaign posters of Mussolini and newspapers reporting on his popularity alongside the actual candidates. Even Ciano himself is reported to have burst out laughing upon hearing the news, finding humor in the peculiar adoration his father-in-law still contains in the hearts of the people."
 ita.6003.a:0 "I wonder what Mussolini would think of all this?"
 ita.6004.t:0 "Allegations of Tyranny!"
 ita.6004.d:0 "The press today was once again filled with explosive headlines about the Blocchi Nazionali. This time, it was about the blatant ties between the BN and the former Partito Nazionale Fascista. While if was fairly obvious that the BN was full of borderline fascists or even actual fascists, the breadth and depth of the ties were unknown until now.\n\nAn investigative journalist successfully infiltrated the BN and what they found was "horrifying", as the Fronte Democratico put it. Money from the old PNF was put in the BN coffers. Politicians basically swapped parties and stayed in the same seat. Nepotism favoring senior PNF politicians. The findings of the journalist went on and on. While the other scandals were eventually weathered, this scandal has hurt the BN greatly. Some politicians involved in the scandal have resigned, causing special elections that the BN is unlikely to win. Multiple members of the BN in parliament have turned their coat and joined the right wing of the Democrazia Cristiana, and worst of all, the BN is starting to lose members at a steady rate. If the trends are to continue, the BN would no longer be the biggest party in Italy, and they could even lose their majority in Parliament.\n\nAlmirante, surprisingly, has responded to this scandal. He has decried them as false reports, and that the so-called 'journalist' is nothing more than a Fronte Democratico spy! Most high ranking BN members have followed his word on this, especially the members who are implicated in the scandal. It is clear that the BN is sticking to their by now classic strategy of weathering the newest scandal."
 ita.6004.a:0 "A mere scandal!"
 ita.6005.t:0 "An Interview with the King"
 ita.6005.d:0 "A recent interview of Umberto II by Franco Alfano has ended up causing another scandal for the Blocchi Nazionali. Almirante has been praising the King of Italy in nearly every speech or discussion recently, to the point that Pietro Nenni, leader of the Fronte Democratico, jokingly praised the king himself in one of his speeches, to much laughter. Therefore, when Umberto II has interviewed recently, it was obvious that Alfano had to ask what Umberto himself thought of the matter. His answer, was...surprising to say the least.\n\nUmberto called Almirante's constant praise an attempt to suck up to the monarchy, and then proceeded to say he'd rather talk about his new medals obtained in service to Italy, which he did for a solid 30 minutes, almost half of the interview. This has turned into an incredibly embarrassing event for the BN, as it shows that the King of Italy basically thinks of Almirante as a joke. This has also, predictably by this point, turned into a scandal.\n\nThe scandal that has erupted from this is about the fact that if the King of Italy cannot even vouch his nominal support to the BN, then what right to they have to rule? As is the case, the BN have remained very quiet, and Almirante has apparently remained unfazed, although he does not praise Umberto II very much anymore, much to the sadness of the FD, who cannot make jokes about it anymore.\n\nIronically, many war veterans who have medals have been interviewed about them due to this, and it seems Umberto has gotten in on the joke, and he can now barely be seen without his frankly impressive collection of medals pinned on his clothes, much to the exasperation of the BN."
 ita.6005.a:0 "That IS a pretty nice array of medals!"
 ita.6006.t:0 "Another Scandal for Almirante!"
 ita.6006.d:0 "To absolutely no one's surprise, the Blocchi Nazionali have involved themselves in yet another scandal. Almirante made a recent speech about his past in fascist Italy, and praised it greatly. Not only that, he called it "a much more prosperous time", much to the horror of basically everyone who aren't fascists. Furthermore, he stated that "Fascism did nothing wrong" which has basically led to his utter ridicule in the media.\n\nThe media, besides ridiculing him, has completely dismantled every part of his speech ana pointed out why every section of it was false or wrong. The Fronte Democratico has finally blatantly called Almirante an "idiot", while the Democrazia Cristiana has seemed to support the sentiment of the FD. Even some of the people in the BN have said that "perhaps it was not such a good thing for Almirante to say", which is incredibly radical for them.\n\nIn comparison, the openly fascist groups of Italy have declared support for Almirante, as "he understands when Italy was at its zenith and why". This has led to a split of sorts in Italian society, as the fascist sections are now in full alignment with Almirante, while the anti fascist sections are in a strong opposition to him."
 ita.6006.a:0 "How will the Blocchi Nazionali recover from this?"
 ita.6007.t:0 "Almirante Goes Before the Chamber"
 ita.6007.d:0 "Today, Honourable Prime Minister Giorgio Almirante has addressed the nation in a speech broadcasted by radio and television. With fiery rhetoric, Almirante offered his account of the events since the inception of Ciano's reforms, including the creation of the Blocchi Nazionali, and the elections themselves. He admitted that his party often "did not show fully its commitment to the democratic cause", but he went on to remark that pride in fascism isn't nostalgia, and that it is not incompatible with genuine love for democracy.\n\nGiorgio Almirante went on to explain the aims and the policies which the Blocchi Nazionali will pursue, and to show that they are merely expressions of the people's will, not a return to the past. Finally, the Prime Minister ended his speech by blaming the political tension experienced by the country on the left opposition. The Fronte Democratico, said Almirante, "isn't very democratic at all, considering their hatred for the democratically elected government". Almirante concluded by saluting the Italian people, and by assuring it that with the Blocchi Nazionali in power, the nation is in good hands.\n\nImmediately, it appeared clear that with this speech, Almirante would finally win over the silent majority of the nation. While leftist groups are still staunchly opposed to the government, moderates and centrists are finally convinced of Almirante's good intentions and political competency, there are rumors that Moro's DC, or at least its right wing, could finally openly side with Almirante's BN. Only one thing is certain, that now, the Blocchi Nazionali have the reins of the nation firmly in their hands, but nobody knows if they will steer Italy towards democracy, or back towards fascism."
 ita.6007.a:0 "Maybe Almirante isn't so bad after all."
 ##Chirdtian Democrats 1966##
 ita_christian_dems_1966:0 "A Victory for Christian Democracy"
 ita_christian_dems_1966_desc:0 "Today, we have achieved a most wonderful accomplishment which shall be recorded in the textbooks and remembered in the minds of all Italians. This great feat is the victory in a free and fair election, one which rocked us and made us fight tooth and nail to ensure the support of the people of Italy. And when it became time for the citizenry to vote, they showed their confidence in us by giving us a mandate of power through the democratic process. And now it is our time to reward their loyalty and faith by delivering on our promises to reform Italy into the nation that the people deserve, a nation for the people, not dictators or extremists. A toast then, for today we will celebrate, and tomorrow we will set off to work, for a better Italy!"

 ita_negotiations_continue:0 "The Negotiations Continue"
 ita_negotiations_continue_desc:0 "We pride ourselves in being the party that will listen to everyone's opinions and respect the other political parties, no matter how much we dislike them. As a token of our good faith, we began meeting with the central leadership of the Fronte Democratico and the Blocchi Nazionali to try and form a coalition government with either of them before the elections even took place. And now that we have achieved victory in these elections, they should be much more receptive to our attempts to negotiate, even if they are a bit embittered at their losses. Hopefully, we will be able to achieve enough support from at least one party to easily pass any and all reforms that we hope to see be put into place. And, even if we are unable to achieve anything worthwhile with the parties, at the very least we will give them a reason to trust or respect us in the coming years."

 ita_fascist_meetup:0 "Meet With The Blocchi Nazionali"
 ita_fascist_meetup_desc:0 "While many Italian political parties would rather quit politics altogether than cooperate with the Blocchi Nazionali, we are above such partisan divides. Even though they appear to simply be rebranded fascists seeking to restore the old system, they have so far shown a willingness to engage in talks about possibly working together in Parliament. This pleases our leadership greatly, as we have yet to achieve the majority it would take to pass any bill we wish. Therefore, in order to further test their commitment to a possible coalition government, Aldo Moro will seek to meet with his rival Giorgio Almirante so as to put our squabbling behind us and move forward hand in hand with the intent of efficiently legislating. While they may not be too keen on our reforms just yet, we're sure that they can be convinced to at least support something if we spend enough time and effort to convince and guide them on the matter."

 ita_keep_promises:0 "Keep the Promises"
 ita_keep_promises_desc:0 "Politics may be a cutthroat business in Italy, but when we gave our word that we would support our armed forces with the funding and attention necessary we intend to keep it. The deals that we made with the military were essential to ensure our legitimacy as a political entity and our survival in this new era, not to mention that it benefited us greatly to have them be less willing to support the Blocchi Nazionali. Now that we have the authority to fulfill our promise, it is time to begin meeting with the generals and representatives of the military do decide what is necessary for them to maintain their fighting ability without overspending ourselves. While many in the party are generally opposed to the expansion of our army and navy due to the need of scarce resources elsewhere in the nation, they will have to accept that we made a promise and that if we break it we will be unable to perform any legislative action as long as we exist."

 ita_the_people_know:0 "The People Know What's Up"
 ita_the_people_know_desc:0 "The fact is, nobody likes fascism anymore except for the senile and the fascists themselves. Not the common man, the businessmen, the intellectuals, the church, the military, the current administration, and the list goes on and on. This is a fact that that the Blocchi Nazionali need to realize before they start making demands of us and try to bargain from a position that they shall never obtain. Although Almirante and his goons will be hard to convince, the truth is self evident that they aren't what they think they are and if they refuse to cooperate their party will likely fall into irrelevance by the next election. Of course, the very existence of their party is based off of the fact that they can't let go of the past and begin again in a new Italy, so who knows if they can abandon their ways for the common good. But, in the end, we can only try, after all we are their only friends..."

 ita_for_our_beautiful_italy:0 "For Our Beautiful Italy"
 ita_for_our_beautiful_italy_desc:0 "We love Italy more than anything on the planet. We would fight for her, we would die for her, and now we live for her, as humble servants to our great goddess. Many on the right have accused us of being unpatriotic and anti-Italian, and these false statements hurt us more than anything else whispered or shouted can. As a way to finally become closer with the Blocchi Nazionali, we must dispel these rumors, as they currently drive a wedge in between us. This can be accomplished by a new campaign consisting of the adoration of our motherland and our willingness to protect her and her interests. Moro himself should give speeches announcing his love for his home nation and how he is going to work in every way to keep her great and powerful in this new era. If all goes to plans, we should be able to both get the old fascists on our side and save face with the public, all in one foul swoop."

 ita_flirt_with_socdems:0 "Flirt With The Fronte Democratico"
 ita_flirt_with_socdems_desc:0 "Although the Fronte Democratico is a far more liberal party than us and will likely be displeased at the extent of our reforms, we share many of the same core beliefs and principles that we use to govern. As such, it would only make sense for us to get their support when the time comes to pass our own reforms. While our policies and legislation won't be quite what the Fronte Democratico wants, given the choice between moderate reform and no reform at all, we are sure that they would make the decision that most benefits Italy and her people. In any event, we should at least open up talks with them so as to repair the damages caused by the election campaigning and open the door for future collaboration. Surely, they can swallow their pride and extreme beliefs to work towards a better tomorrow for the common man alongside us."

 ita_the_day_will_come_desc:0 "For years have we kept to the shadows, afraid of the wrath that would follow us if we sought our dream of a democratic Italy that protects her people instead of persecuting them. But as the old dictator died, a new man replaced him, one that gave us a second chance to make our nation truly wonderful, sealing it by stepping down from power to usher in a new election. And now the ball is in our court, we are the ones who control the destiny of this magnificent empire and the fate of her people, and this fate is none other than a transition into a permanent democracy, one that cannot ever revert back into fascism and will instead grow to serve us well. It is time that we relish this moment not alone, but with our friends the Fronte Democratico, who have also sought the same ends, albeit different means. Together we can stand united in our love of freedom and democracy, the two pillars from which our stability is held."

 ita_sort_out_differences:0 "Sort Out Our Differences"
 ita_sort_out_differences_desc:0 "While the Fronte Democratico and the Democrazia Cristiana share many core beliefs, however the devil is in the details as far as our rivalry goes. Especially during the most recent elections, these minor inconsistencies have been the source of much contention between us, and as such we have not had the opportunity to cooperate efficiently. It is now on our shoulders to see that we move on past these trivial topics and instead embrace our similarities with the Fronte Democratico so as to allow us to work together in the years to come. We will go about this in many ways, such as using positive promotions of general reform rather than supporting loaded advertisements that propagate our differences. Maybe, if we are able to reach out a friendly hand, they will clasp it and give Italy a chance for some truly beneficial change."

 ita_for_the_young_democracy:0 "For The Young Democracy"
 ita_for_the_young_democracy_desc:0 "There is no greater danger to a democratic institution than a stagnate legislature, but that is what we will face unless we can cooperate with the Fronte Democratico and get reforms through Parliament. Surely, they must realize that this nation is like a young child and we are the squabbling parents that, although unable to like each other, will come together and face any challenge to protect our youthful offspring. After all, in a democracy the power of the government is the power of trust earned, and the people will not be able to give us this faith if we fail to give them any reforms in our first years of office. While they may not like it, the Fronte Democratico must work with us and vote in our common interests, as to not do so would spell certain doom for the great nation we have toiled so hard to develop."

 ita_so_far_so_good:0 "Making Ciano Proud"
 ita_so_far_so_good_desc:0 "One man is singularly responsible for delivering unto Italy the democracy under which we now have the ability to flourish, and this man is Galeazzo Ciano, the Saviour of Italy, the Light Shining in Darkness, the Duce! By stepping down from the role of leader and returning the power to the people, he has set an extraordinary precedent that will persist for generations. We now stand as his successors, hoping to fulfill the great responsibility to achieve the dream he envisioned, of a good nation with happy people and a moral backbone. It is now our duty to do whatever it takes, no matter how long, hard, or costly, to turn this place into the great beacon of freedom that is so needed to brighten up the black spot that is Europe. We can accomplish anything we set our minds to, and boy are our ambitions big!"
 
 ita_educcation_reform_now:0 "The Education Campaign"
 ita_educcation_reform_now_desc:0 "Currently, the education system in Italy is governed by the Riforma Gentile, created in 1923 and set up by Mussolini's government. While it has indeed served us well, as time passed it became more and more apparent that it is simply insufficient for our era. For starters, the current reforms are strongly hierarchic, favoring the humanities and the theoretical sciences (taught in the "licei") to the detriment of the technical and professional schools (the "istituti") for this reason, many lower class children are simply encouraged to leave the schools, rather than pursue a field of study which would be useful only if they could afford university. We must reform the educational system to incentivize the fields of knowledge that have been left behind, and which will propel Italy into a new age of science and technology."

 ita_convincing_the_fascists_edu:0 "To Convince a Fascist"
 ita_convincing_the_fascists_edu_desc:0 "The current education laws have something of a pedigree, they owe their name to one of the most famous and prominent fascist intellectuals, Giovanni Gentile. For this reasons, they are considered the pride of the fascist regime, and many among the right wing don't see kindly to the idea of changing them. If we want our reforms to pass, we must pander in some ways to the moderate members of the Blocchi Nazionali, by reassuring that the changes we make will be nothing revolutionary, but just a step ahead in the road to modernity."

 ita_what_the_fash_want_desc:0 "The kind of elitism that is currently present in the Italian school is indeed well liked by the fascists. The hierarchical system of the Gentile Reforms, which theoretical schools at the top, was designed to create what would become the fascist ruling class, as opposed to the common folk. We can keep a somewhat similar system, while removing its most overt elements, the "licei" will maintain a predominant position at least in name, but funds will be shifted to the "istituti". This long term investment won't hinder the current educational hierarchy, instead simply making the current structure more productive."

 ita_noone_likes_you_anyways:0 "Nobody Likes You Anyways"
 ita_noone_likes_you_anyways_desc:0 "There are some things that we simply can't agree about. The fascists demanded that the heavy patriotic or overtly fascist propaganda that was infused into Italian schools be maintained, while we are hard at work dismantling it. We simply can't spend time and resources teaching children how to sing the praises of fascism, when the same time and resources could be used to teach them how to work. We'll have to make sure that our educational system will be apolitical and fair, without unnecessary relics of a bygone era."

If young people don't go to school, our population will simply lack the technical professionals which are sorely needed to innovate the Italian economy. We need technicians, engineers, accountants, surveyors, all kinds of lower-middle class professionals that our schools simply aren't providing. Such careers would be a keystone for a better economy, and a better economy for the nation means more wealth for its citizens, and since everyone likes money, we can be sure that if we paint the matter in this light, we'll be able to gain more than a few supporters."

The lack of education that often plagues these areas is one of the key reasons for their underdevelopment, a key part of our reforms will be a massive push to encourage school attendance for everyone. We will invest money to build new schools, repair the old ones, and set up schoolbus networks to make sure that every child and adolescent in Italy has easy and quick access to a clean, well kept school. This should dramatically reduce truancy, and make the people realize what great opportunities education offers them."

First of all, they want the school system to be completely secular, without the catholic religion as a subject, and that is simply preposterous.

To make them content, we gave them tax cuts for poor people to help them pay for schooltexts and other such expenses, along with other such social security measures, but we'll concede no more. We and them together can change Italy for the better; separated, we'll never bring about the change our country needs."

 ##CD EVENTS##

 christdem.1.t:0 "Christian Democrats Victorious!"
 christdem.1.d:0 "The votes have been counted, and it has become clear to all of Italy that Aldo Moro and his Christian Democrat party has seized control of the government. With strong showings in both the upper and lower chambers of Parliament, the Christian Democrats have dominant legislative power in Rome, and it is now their turn to lead the nation. Celebrations are already taking place in the streets, not only because of who won, but because they just had their first free and fair elections in a very long time.\n Moro, in response to this great victory, aired a speech on the radio welcoming the election results and showing his appreciation for the trust given to him by the Italian people. In this broadcast, he first thanked the people for electing him and promised to do everything in his power to improve their lives and the state of Italy. Next, he went on to explain how his government would work towards ensuring that the other parties are still given a fair voice and the ability to cooperate in matters of policy. Cheerfully, he went on to explain that this was a new dawn for Italy and for the first time in a long time her future is looking bright.\n After the broadcast, the losing parties gave their concession speeches, and although not nearly as joyful, the public was happy to see them accept defeat with grace. Now it is time for Moro to really reform the Empire to his liking. Having platformed on mostly education reform and social security, it is predicted that he will follow through and let them be his main focus for the time coming. He will also attempt to work with the other parties, even the Blocchi Nazionali, to make certain that this first democratic government doesn't collapse as a result of infighting. This is a historic day for not only Moro himself, but all of Italy and the world."

 christdem.6.t:0 "Christian Democrats Open Coalition Negotiations"
 christdem.6.d:0 "In the ecstasy following the Christian Democrats victory in the Italian Empire's first democratic election, it was easy to forget a hard truth, despite their strong showing, the CD fell far short of a majority in the Italian Parliament, and hence, to accomplish anything significant in their agenda, must make a coalition agreement with one of the other parties. The Christian Democrats first choice would be the Fronte Democratico, who share their commitment to Italian Democracy and desire for entitlement and education reform. However, early signals from the SD seem to suggest that this course will be difficult. As the price for their cooperation, The Fronte Democratico have demanded that the new educational curriculum include a segment on the "fascist period" and in particular, the "clerical institutions", who through their "cooperation" with the oppressive regime extended its longevity and cruelty. A suggestion that is considered frankly insulting by the strongly Catholic CD.\n\nOf course, the Fronte Democratico are not the only potential coalition partner for the Christian Democrats, there is also the Blocchi Nazionali-- the avowedly nationalist organization made up almost entirely of former Fascist Party members. The NB's leader Giorgio Almirante has declared his parties great willingness to cooperate with the CD, calling them "our brothers, dedicated to a strong Italian Empire", and has asked for only minor concessions as the price for a coalition government. However, the Christian Democrats fear polluting their commitment to the new Italy by working with a party that still salutes Mussolini the Patriot besides Ciano the Reformer. During the campaign, the CD had firmly disavowed any possibility of allying with the National Bloc, but the CD's leader Aldo Moro has since walked back this position, claiming that his party is "open to working with any group that believes in a peaceful democratic Italy". Some have argued this is just a tactic to pressure the Fronte Democratico to ease their coalition demands, while others believe it prestiges a broad right-wing coalition."
 christdem.6.a:0 "We must find a partner worthy of our ambitions!"

 christdem.7.t:0 "A Meeting with the Blocchi Nazionali"
 christdem.7.d:0 "Today, Aldo Moro has personally sat down with Giorgio Almirante and other Blocchi Nazionali party officials to discuss forming a coalition government in Parliament. So far, Almirante's party has expressed a willingness to work with the Christian Democrats and this meeting had high expectations attached to it by both parties. It began rather formally, with hand shaking and smiles and the politicians all acting as if they were old friends and not just recently tearing each other apart in the elections. However, as talks began and the Blocchi Nazionali began making their demands, it became abundantly clear that there would be no compromise. To start off with, Almirante refused to negotiate if Moro pursued his policies of education reform and social security, saying that both would end up damaging Italy more than helping it. He went on to counter every single proposition made by Moro and practically inferred that there would be no reform in a coalition with his party. As if that wasn't enough, the final nail in the coffin was when Almirante began to rant about how the Christian Democrats should instead support his policies rather than pursue theirs and that was the only way to keep the Italian Empire alive. Realizing that this was completely futile, the Christian Democrats began signaling that no coalition would be made and that the meeting had come to a close. Not understanding, or perhaps not caring, Almirante only continued on with his insane plans, explaining the political situation as if the Blocchi Nazionali had won the elections and they were trying to make a coalition. About an hour later, Almirante was finally satisfied with himself and let the meeting end. The damage had already been done, however, and it was plain to anybody in Rome that there was no chance of the two parties working together in the future."
 christdem.7.a:0 "Probably for the best, all things considered."

 christdem.8.t:0 "Negotiations Complete"
 christdem.8.d:0 "The Christian Democrat party has officially formed a coalition with the small Liberal Party under Bruno Visentini, and the talks with the talks with the Fronte Democratico have mostly concluded and are generally positive. With enough support behind him Moro is now ready to move onto other priorities, chief among them actually passing the gradual reforms that we campaigned on. It is high time we actually create some legislature, after all that is what we were elected into office to do. The initial bills have been drafted and they are ready to be introduced into the lower chamber. Hopefully, we will be able to get them through with enough support in the coming future through our deals and coalition. Every single representative that has been recently elected is quite excited for these first few steps, and the people cry out for us to take Italy by the hand and lead her to a brighter world, and it is our duty to oblige them. We will make these ideas and reforms into law and not allow anything to stop us in our great quest to bring upon a better world. Hopefully, the other parties can see the same thing and work with us rather than against us, for only together do we have a chance of actually accomplishing anything. Moro himself is perhaps the most optimistic, being described as constantly smiling and always happy to discuss policy with anyone in ear reach. He has even held conferences with individual deputies to both ensure their support and ask their opinions on key issues, never fading in his hope to create a good, functioning administration. It is not sure if he will maintain this enthusiasm, however, as politics is said to destroy even the most iron of wills."
 christdem.8.a:0 "Let's get down to business!"

 christdem.9.t:0 "Education Reform Bill Proposed in the Chamber"
 christdem.9.d:0 "The Democrazia Cristiana party has recently proposed their first bill meant to address the education problem in Italy. The bill, entitled the Delegated Decrees on Schooling, or "Moro Reform" would include a variety of reforms mostly centered around mandatory education in primary and secondary levels of schooling for all Italian youth.\n\nHowever, we are a long way off from turning this bill into a law as the process has only just begun. If we wish for the reform to ever come into reality, we must must work tirelessly to convince the other parties to support it. Specifically, we need either the social democrat votes or the fascist votes in order to pass the law. The Liberal Party, while small and mostly insignificant, will likely vote with us without any accomodation, but it is certain that the two major parties will request certain provisions to be added or removed and we will have to negotiate to earn their favor.\n\nThis is still a great step for our administration, and the people will be excited to know that we are actively setting out to accomplish our promises. If we succeed, this will both be a major victory for our party and all of Italy, for by educating the youth we will truly earn our place as a modern nation with modern principles."
 christdem.9.a:0 "Moro will get us those votes!"

 christdem.10.t:0 "Peeling Away Votes from the Fascists"
 christdem.10.d:0 "Although we were unable to form a coalition with the Blocchi Nazionali, there must be a few less extreme member of the party who would support these minor reforms. It is now time to do every deputy's favorite task, going around and begging other representatives to try and support our legislature that will soon be decided upon. All it should take is a little bit of compromising and a sprinkle of smooth talking from Moro to convince at least a few of the idiots to support our bill, right? Of course, nothing is that simple, as many are either making outrageous demands or giving vague responses, leaving us unsure of whether or not they will be on our side. This is troubling, but hopefully we managed to get some of them to vote with us, at least enough to secure a majority when the final vote is made in a few weeks. In the end, the fascists will at least be grateful that we tried to include them in the negotiations, and this could plant the seed for future cooperation when they inevitably get sick of being in a party that can't accomplish get any bills passed. Only time will tell if we can achieve our task of giving education to the children of Italy. Surely, partisan troubles can't possibly stand in the way of common-sense reform, not forever. Moro has one more meeting with some of the members of Blocchi Nazionali soon, and it may be his final chance to gain the support he needs."
 christdem.10.a:0 "Democracy isn't all it's cracked up to be."
 christdem.10.b:0 "We need the votes, no matter the cost."

 christdem.11.t:0 "The Final Demands"
 christdem.11.d:0 "Today, after Moro sat down with the remaining Blocchi Nazionali members who are still on the fence about the education reform, he finally got the list of what it would take to get their votes. These demands were handed over with very little formalities or subtly, with the clear assumption that unless the bill had what they wanted, there would be no votes for it from them. The first demand was that of historical revisionism. The fascists are rather afraid of us introducing educational materials and works that would counter what they believe to be indisputable facts. They still see Benito Mussolini as Italy's great savior, and they simply must have him and the Fascist Party be given the appropriate attention and praise that they deserve. While we would never dare enforce anything that challenged Mussolini's fame and importance, this appears to be seeking praise of the very system of government we just abandoned for good reason, and many of the misconceptions that the Blocchi Nazionali would like to see pushed in schools are borderline lies and propaganda. However, the writing is on the wall, and we will have to conform to what they want if we wish to gain their votes when the time comes. Now, our party is faced with this dilemma. If we do what Almirante's party wants, we could secure the support we need while sacrificing many of the values and honest beliefs that we campaigned on. If we fail to gain the votes, our reform's could fail to pass and the children will suffer for our inability to take action. The ball is now in the Christian Democrats court."
 christdem.11.a:0 "Compromise is a wicked thing."

 christdem.12.t:0 "Securing Internal Support"
 christdem.12.d:0 "With the bill to reform the education system in Italy no longer new news, it has become necessary to ensure that the members of our party are still fully behind it. After all, this is a pillar of the Christian Democrat platform and our survival in the political landscape depends on our ability to band together and pass the essential legislation that we promised to the voters. Fractures in the party lines now could also lead to more trouble down the line, and then there would be no hope for us to win the next election. We will start with simply reminding the deputies that align with us of the importance of this bill to ensure that they do not get distracted from the primary task at hand. Meanwhile, a renewed advertising campaign will both rile up the public and put the pressure on the parliament to see FEOTA is able to pass through and become law. The public has already shown a determination to improve educational standards in the elections, and forgetting to fulfill that promise we made to them would be fatal for any party member seeking to be reelected. Of course, we are not expecting any resistance from our officials in regards to the situation and are not seeking to threaten them in any way, instead, we only seek to unite them at a time when unity and cooperation are the only things keeping the government, and all of Italy, together. After this shake up, we will be primed and ready to restart our efforts towards converting the votes of opposing parties to achieve the majority we need."
 christdem.12.a:0 "Let's hope this all pays off."

 christdem.13.t:0 "Moro gives speech in support of reforms"
 christdem.13.d:0 "Today, Aldo Moro has given a televised speech to the people of Italy in an attempt to build support for the Moro Reform. Education reform has been a constant demand by the populace, and Moro is hoping that they will pressure the members of the other parties to join on in support of the legislation.\nHe began simply, speaking about the abhorrent history of Italian education in the last century, how it has lagged behind the other nations of Europe and how even today hundreds of thousands of Italian people don't even have a high school diploma. He then spoke of the wonders of mandatory education and how a simple high school education, while somewhat difficult to attain, would serve the children of Italy for the rest of their lives. This would give the poor the opportunity to become rich, the ignorant to become scholarly, and the lazy to become hard working, only if the nation could unite and pass the bill that the Democrazia Cristiana have proposed. He finished the speech with a plea to the Fronte Democratico and the Blocchi Nazionali, a plea for unity and solidarity to pass the bill that will give young Italians everywhere the chance that they need to succeed in life. Moro explained that this is not a partisan issue, or even a political one, but it is instead a moral obligation that we have to our children and country.\nRousing many, public opinion polls have already shown an increase of the bill, and many party officials are hoping that this translates into political influence and votes from the other parties. At the very least, we put on display our concern and love for the people, and our opponents will have to fight an uphill battle to challenge Moro now."
 christdem.13.a:0 "The people stand behind us!"

 christdem.14.t:0 "A Meeting with Fronte Democratico"
 christdem.14.d:0 "The more liberal elements of our party have taken it upon themselves to meet with the left-wing Fronte Democratico party in an attempt to ensure they support our education bill when we hold the vote on the issue. Thankfully, we appear to be in good graces with the party and the hopes are that they will help is in this matter, giving us the votes we need and the ability to work closely with them in the future. Of course, we know that they will want us to make changes to the bill and reform the system to a much higher degree, but there is nothing in the legislation itself that the party would find repugnant and it is likely that we won't have much trouble getting them on board. We have even sweetened the deal by promising them future cooperation in regards to other reforms and policies that they find beneficial. The parties response has so far been a bit cautious, but mostly optimistic as education is a pillar of society that we all see is worth mending. It is predicted that they will give us an official response soon regarding their stance, and when they do we will know what must be done in order to achieve that threshold of supporters necessary to secure the bills chance of success. Meanwhile, this meeting has been met with criticism from the Blocchi Nazionali, who sees this move as disrespectful and weak. While their words do not affect us, we must make efforts to keep our independence and not really on other parties too much to achieve legislative progress. "
 christdem.14.a:0 "We must keep moving!"

 christdem.15.t:0 "Fronte Democratico Gives Their Reply"
 christdem.15.d:0 "Finally, after much stalling, the Fronte Democratico has given us the answer to our plea for help. Their response, while not a refusal or acceptance of support, is a deal that if we add certain parts to the bill then they will vote for it and back our party. This was to be expected, as nobody in politics ever agrees to anything without some negotiations. It appears that every single one of their demands is simply taking one of our parts of the bill and making it far more extreme in liberalization and practice. For example, while we wish to enforce a mandatory education for all students, the liberals would have us also put in place a common curriculum that ensures the children have a full and regimented education. That is one of the more mild requests, with some even asking that we include funding and resources for completely unrelated areas like subsidies for university students and grants for research. While many of these preliminary demands will be rendered null with a bit of negotiation, the fact stands that we will have to alter and add reforms to the bill if we wish to gain the support of the Fronte Democratico when we vote. Leadership of the Christian Democrat party however is urging caution, as fulfilling their demands too much will both make us look weak and make us lose the support of moderate-right deputies that have so far aligned with us."
 christdem.15.a:0 "All that matters is that we pass this bill!"

 christdem.16.t:0 "Voting Begins on the Moro Reform"
 christdem.16.d:0 "The Chamber is buzzing with activity, as today is the day that the deputies vote on the first major bill to be introduced into a democratic Italy. The Delegated Decrees on Schooling, the bill designed to improve educational standards and general quality of life in the nation, has been highly contentious and many are wondering if it will be able to pass through with enough votes to become law.\nMoro has been in a generally good mood, and while anxious at the prospect of having his first piece of legislation be a failure, is in high hopes and good spirits. Upon being questioned by a reporter as to his expectations, he responded by announcing that he expects many Italian politicians will be able to spot the merit in the bill and will put aside partisan squabbling to pass it, as the common interest amongst them is to help the people, not hinder them. However, it is well known that this bill's death would spell doom for both Moro and the Democrazia Cristiana, and being unable to pass legislation would inevitably lead to them losing the next elections.\nNo matter if the votes are in our favor or not, the populace will be watching us and responding appropriately to the results. Now we can only hold our breath and pray for good fortune."

Behind the scenes, talks of armed intervention began to conspire. Duce Almirante, fearing to let paranoia lead to his fall, chose not to investigate the rumors.\n\nThis morning forces of the Carabinieri stormed both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

But in the modern day, its power lays just beneath the surface, and takes the form of oil.\n\nOil is the lifeblood of armies, of industries and of nations, and it is our control over the Middle Eastern oil fields that provides Italy with her economic power. But chaos has broken out across the Middle East starting with a civil war in Yemen, and the rebellious fever has spread to Egypt and Syria. Some of these demagogues and renegades are fueled by religious zeal, others by dreams of a single state for the entire Arab world, and others still by simple anti-Monarchist sentiment.

Even together, the current monarch of one of the richest nations on Earth is so complicated an individual and so self-contained that such descriptions likely only scratch the surface.\n\nDuce Scorza himself is a man of similar complexities, and has written to the Muslim king proposing a meeting where a return to the past friendship between the Empire and Arabia may be brokered."

Rather awkwardly, due to its often extreme nature and anti-western bent, Wahhabism is not a generally tolerated faith in the Empire. Naturally we had considered it dangerous to greater imperial survival to discourage religious messages that could be easily used as nationalist or terroristic rallying cries. Nothing about the present circumstances has much changed our evealtuon of this interpretation of Islam, but it seems our hands may be somewhat tied. If we continue to barr Wahhabist clerics from preaching in our Muslim heavy terriroties we may lose their trust and this crucial alliance may collapse as disastoruosly as our Axis with Germany did. So for the time being we have little choice but to allow those firebrands and zealots to proselytize as they please. It can't hurt that much right?"

While the kingdom is hardly helpless, having the so-called Fourth World power as an ally would be enough to excite any leader with the ambitions that Faisal possesses.\n\nNext to the enthusiastic monarch sits Duce Scorza, who in stark contrast betrays almost no emotion at all. Or so one might think at first glance. However, a closer look and one might just detect the faintest hint of a scowl, an ever-so upturned lip, a quivering brow.

 nscorza.505.d:0 "Well, giving the factories back to the workers seemed like a worry-free solution to all of Italy's problems, but it turns out that money and power are a little more synomenous than we had previously thought. With their sudden loss of privilege, Italy's capitalists are removing their investments from the economy, and keeping their liquid assets close to the chest. \n\nObviously, this is rather inconvenient for our attempts to make Italy a feared and respected power  in the world. Were it just a few of the no-good profiteers taking these un-patriotic actions, we'd naturally send the MSVN to sort them out, but the scale of this subversion makes this dangerous. If we seize their assets today, they may flethe nation all together in the morrow."

 nscorza.506.d:0 "At last, Italian industry is as it should be.

We are the rightful representatives of the Italian people, the Italian nation, and the Italian future, is it not natural that we should determine Italian production as well?\n\nAlthough there are still plenty of skeptics, in time they will understand. It is for their own good after all.

No matter how stringitly we set the factory quotas, they're never quite met. No matter how many feverishly we pursue the practitioners of graft and corruption, they always seem to escape us. \n \nThe italian economy has degenerated into an almost absurdist state of chaos and incompetence. The Fascist government has proven to be sadly incapable of bearing the massive burden of management that has been thrust upon it. There are still those within the PNF who argue that our rules are not the problem, only their application. However, the chorus of voices calling for halting our economic programm, or even its reversal, grows ever louder."

 nscorza.508.t:0 "But It Feeds Them!"
 nscorza.508.d:0 "The Italian Fascist and the Italian Worker have always been close, if not synonymous. But now, when we need them most it seems that the laborers have deserted the state that gave them control over their factories and futures. \n \nIt seems like this theoretical autonomy (which has been less substantial in practice), has not been enough to compensate the factory-workers for the widespread inflation of the CURRENCY, and the steady decline in safety protocol. Although the meticulous application of the MSVN is enough to keep the situation in hand for now, the way things are going, it is unlikely to stay that way."
 nscorza.508.a:0 "Why aren't they grateful for our help?"

 nscorza.509.t:0 "Our So Called Friends"
 nscorza.509.d:0 "The Fascist economic model was supposed to be good for workers, unions, bosses, and the state altogether, but it increasingly seems like it fails all but the last of them. Recently, it is the unions who have been complaining. Though hypothetically re-organized into more efficient government controlled bodies, the old structures persist, and are increasingly furious at their perceived micromanagement by our movement. \n \nThe unions have made it clear that unless we accede to their demands for the broad reversal of Fascist reforms, they will unleash a wave of strikes such as the nation has never seen before. Unlike the weak parties of old, the PNF is not one to easily accede to such bullying, but it increasingly seems like we may not have a choice."
 nscorza.509.a:0 "Those damn unions."
 
 nscorza.510.t:0 "Red Impotence"
 nscorza.510.d:0 "Throughout the history of Italian Fascism, the PNF has always understood the special importance of Communism. Specifically, to keep the people scared enough that they'll obey whatever directives we give them. Unfortunately, it seems like with the major Communist organizatiosn long destroyed, and fascism more than half a century old, this threat no longer has the value it once did. Perhaps the uniting factor of the Red boogeyman can be restored if we simply update our propoganda for the modern era, but it might be that we need to lay the old propaganda presses down once and for all."

 nscorza.511.t:0 "Assure The Profiteers"
 nscorza.511.d:0 "As if merely to spite us, Italy's capitalists and profiteers have compounded our industrial woes by persisting in their campaign to undo our recent reform programs. In op-eds across a large number of leading newspapers appealing to Italy's upper crust, the writers derided the changes in leadership we've recently implemented, whith one calling them "atrocious overreach by unscrupulous politicians in Rome seeking to  rob us of our hard earned wealth and rightful privileges".\n\nWhile actually rolling back our reforms and returning control of the factories to these petty bourgeois profiteers is of course off the table, perhaps some minor concessions will help to keep these pampered fools (and their tax dollars) from fleeing from our reach. \n\nOf course, if even these concessions aren't enough for them, there is always the other option of sending in the MSVN to show these capitalist pigs who really runs the country."

 nscorza.512.t:0 "Warrior Producers"
 nscorza.512.d:0 "Despite all the good that the Fascist revolution has done for them, it seems like Italy's factory workers and laborers still aren't satisfied with our rule. Although we've given them control over their factories and authority in their lives, in line with the cooperatist doctrine of Fascism, they continue to complain incessantly about "potemkin freedom that seeks to placate rather than improve" and "oh god my arm! The machine tore my arm off!" in a clear challenge to the fairly decided safety regulations we've created. \n\nGiven that our financial situation is a little..unstable at the moment, actually undoing our new system or giving the workers monetary rewards just isn't feasible. Thankfully there's a solution that's sure to succeed: a broad and bold campaign of propaganda to celebrate the Italian "Warrior Producers" who boldly sacrifice (the occasional limb) to keep their country great.\n\nWhile a few might see this as just another cynical attempt to make them tolerate ever lower standards of work and wages, most of the workers will no doubt be whipped into shape by this program, and leap happily back to their machines in an instant!"
 nscorza.512.a:0 "The Italian men shall become the best of workers."
 
 nscorza.513.t:0 "Quis Contra No?s"
 nscorza.513.d:0 "It was a long struggle to forge Fascist Italy. THere were naysayers and deniers the whole way who claimed that Fascist economics was simply unworkable. They warned us that we'd do nothing but permanently stunt the Italian economy, and potentially unleash a wave of unrest and destabilization. Justas we ignored these fools in the forging our empire, we ignored them in the implementation of Mussolini's vision, confident that the fascist way would prove right in time.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that we were wrong.\n\nOur attempts to forge a new and more productive cooperative arrangement between  Workers and managers has done nothing but alienate both of them. The beautiful future we worked so hard to build appears to have been nothing but a delusion, and all of the blood, toil, tears and sweat that we sacrificed to build it were for nothing. \n\nEven now, as our factories are filled with strikes and sabotage, and the wealthy flee our nation for friendlier climates there are those who still believe in Fascism. Maybe we should too. Afterall, sending in the Blackshirts to simply solve the problem with blood and bullets might not be the most "humane situation" (or the most in linew ith Fascist doctrine)  but it'd certainly be easier than making the painful adjustments to our structures and ideology admitting failure would entail.\n\nOn the other had, perhaps its best to accept defeat, admit that we failed, and change for the better. After all, if Fascism does not serve the Italian Nation and the Italian Worker, who does it serve? We are not some petty despotic dictatorship or extremist empire, Fascism has always been devoted to the Italian people, and they to it. If Fascism does not serve them, then Fascism should not exist.\n\nEither way, forward or back, the time has come to choose."

 nscorza.901.t:0 "A New School of Economics"
 nscorza.901.d:0 ""This is madness!" the voice echoed through the halls of Palazzo Venezia, coming from the private office of the Duce. Even the guards at the door couldn't resist wondering how could a lowly economist stand up against their leader... "Italy can't sustain an economic growth of 15% per year! There are not enough industries, not enough resources, not enough workers!"\n\nAldo Amatuzzi, soon-to-be-former professor of economy and president of the Italian Economic Agency, had entered the room expecting another tirade on how Italy wan't growing fast enough. What he didn't expect was finding a heavy folder with a comprehensive plan for drastic economic reforms: now, his face was red as he tried to explain the calmly smiling Duce why the content of that accursed bag would mean the end for Italian economy. "It is madness only if you look at it through the flawed lenses of liberalism and through the flawed logic of strict reality" Scorza pointed out, "What Italy needs is someone ready to make the necessary sacrifices, to exceed reality, and a people strong enough to take them!" to which Amatuzzi looked at him as if he was looking at a psychiatric patient. He was still screaming when the guards brought him away.\n\nWhen the last echoes had faded, the Duce nodded towards his private secretary, who was typing at his desk: "Aldo, please call the Ministry for Economic Affairs: if the members of the planning board are like this one, we will need drastic measures to ensure Italy achieves the greatness it deserves" immediately, the secretary bowed slightly and immediately left the room to make the call. As soon as the door had closed, his smile tilted upwards, way more than any reassuring smile should..."

 nscorza.902.t:0 "Credere! Obbedire! Lavorare!"
 nscorza.902.d:0 "After the usual five-hours shift, the siren gave the signal for the ten-minute pause. By now, Gaetano Marozzi had learnt by heart every inflexion of the pre-registered voice: "Dieci minuti di pausa. Chi non ritornerà al secondo suono sarà sanzionato" and of course, they all knew what the "sanction" was... He run to the bathroom: luckily, his post was near the door, so he was the first to reach one of the ten loos available for the two thousand workers, which left him with eight and a half minutes to eat the sandwich his wife had made.\n\nWhen he returned to his post, he felt a scrap of paper being softly slipped into the pocket of his coverall: looking behind himself, he saw Marco, his best friend, nodding towards him. Blood froze in his veins as he read "SCIOPERO". Images started to run wildly inside his mind: his family brought away, himself toiling to death in a labour camp, never to see his children again... Instinct was stronger. "Anti-fascist propaganda!" he screamed, and everyone stopped. Immediately, two people dressed like him - but he knew better - were at his side. One of them took the paper: "Who gave it to you?" to which Gaetano looked, and saw Marco silently begging him with his eyes. He remembered playing with him at school, the countless evenings at the bar, the football matches, the laughs and the playful fights. He remembered being the godfather for Lucia, Marco's daughter, his pride and joy... With tears in his eyes, he silently pointed his finger.\n\n"Traitor! Scab! Bastard!" Marco screamed as the OVRA brought him away. A well-dressed man came by Gaetano's side, patting him on the shoulder: "My compliments! We suspected him of anti-fascist propaganda, but never managed to frame him. You showed great loyalty towards the Duce by doing this: after all, he "was" your best friend... Come with me, you'll get a promotion and a new place to work, far away from here: these wretches tend to forget the value of loyalty these days..." Gaetano followed him, but didn't listen to a single word, trying to find the answer to the one question occupying his mind."
 nscorza.902.a:0 "Why do I feel so much shame and regret?"
 
 nscorza.1001.t:0 "An Economic Fortress"
 nscorza.1001.d:0 "Carlo Scorza had maintained Mussolini's tradition, and even at night, the light of the Duce's personal office in Palazzo Venezia shone brightly, reminding everyone that while all honest men slept, the Duce kept vigil over Italy. That night, however, was different, as the entire Palace was alive: reports came in every passing hour, and the Duce's desk was littered with empty coffee cups.\n\nUncertainty transpired from all reports on the precious desk: Germany's collapsing economy, Japan's economic war, America's tampering with established order in Africa, tensions in the Middle East steadily rising, the list was far longer than any economist would be comfortable with. The office was silent, the only sound coming from the regular typing of Scorza's private secretary. Sipping from another cup of coffee, Scorza wondered how to protect Italy from the next storm, one which could potentially be even more devastating than the last war and Atlantropa put together. He felt powerless, like the commander of a besieged castle, unable to do anything other than look his enemies prepare for the final assault.\n\nHis head shot up. Yes! A castle! Perhaps he couldn't influence the way the crisis would start, but surely he could erect walls, shore up the defences so that the country might survive the storm! Italy needed to become an economic fortress, impregnable and independent from foreign influence, and there was only one way to achieve this: autarky, Mussolini's very own invention, would return to the forefront of Italian economics. "Aldo!" he startled his secretary, "call immediately the Minister for the Economic Affairs! I don't care if he's sleeping, there's work to be done!" to which the man nodded and left the room. Carlo Scorza finally relaxed on his chair: now, everything was a bit clearer."

Carlo Scorza nodded his head in recognition, then motioned for the fifteen men to sit on the plush armchairs his private secretary had prepared in advance. "Aldo, would you please bring us refreshments?" he said, to which the efficient aide bowed slightly and left. Then, he looked at the man sitting directly in front of him: "Minister Zerbino, I'm anxious to know the result of our autarchic measures: I believe you have all the information I need"\n\n"Sì, mio Duce" Paolo Zerbino said, and hurriedly opened his suitcase, extracting a voluminous report: "As you can see, our efforts have been paying out: resource extraction has dramatically increased both in the mainland and in the other parts of our Empire, and industrial production is constantly growing all across our possessions. While it will take time to ensure full agricultural independence, we are confident that the new rationalisation reforms, and research on high-yield crops and fertilisers, will give us what we need" then, he nodded to one of the members of the planning board, who begun to talk in detail about the reforms and their results. When all had finished, the Duce lightly clapped his hands: "I'm proud of you, gentlemen! With what you have done, we managed to ensure Italy's survival even in the most dramatic circumstances" to which the Minister couldn't stop bowing in gratitude.After all had left, the Duce allowed himself a small joke as he thought of his Minister: a competent man indeed, but perhaps a bit too... willing to serve."

Under the strong guidance of our Duce Carlo Scorza, Italy has been reborn, and now he leads the way towards a brighter future!\n\nAs you look around, you can only see new factories opening, and new business setting up shop all throughout the Boot. Not just mainland Italy, but the entirety of our Empire is experiencing a new golden age of prosperity: in Suez, the naval traffic has increased tenfold, and from Ethiopia to the Gulf, Italian businessmen and local farmers experience a surge in productivity never seen from the days of the draining of the Pontine Marshes by our Glorious First Duce!\n\nAs the entirety of Italy grows stronger together, it entwines deeper and deeper, until each and every city is inextricably interwoven with the rest of the Empire, creating a new, thriving, and united community which has no precedent in our history! If things keep going this way, ladies and gentlemen, we will stepping closer and closer to our great dream: one day, we shall truly rebuild the Roman Empire! Gloria all'Italia! Gloria al Fascismo!

By the smart intuition of the glorious first Duce Mussolini, who devised a strategy to make Italy independent from the schemes of resource-rich countries, and by the selfless acts of the Italian population, who renounced to many commodities in order to help the war effort, we managed to produce what we needed, and keep fighting when countries far more powerful than ours would have given up!\n\nWhile our colonial empire grants us much more resources than what we had twenty years ago, we still can't compete with our rivals in the Reich or the United States. Therefore, we must improve our policy of autarky, and ensure that we can still be economically independent even in the event of another world conflict."

No, the truth that has been revealed by the modern world is that the only thing worth pursuing as a state is power, and that the exercise of that power is the ultimate goal. Those who would seek to dissuade us from such a path reveal themselves as either cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Look at what the Germans accomplished! While Ciano persuaded Mussolini to follow more high minded ideals the Reich swallowed almost all of Europe and Africa, leaving us with the scraps. Duce Scorza has learned the lesson of this event well, and the next time around, it will be Italy doing the taking while all others watch in impotence."

The one where the subjects are not inconvenienced by the presence of the overlord will, of course, be the stronger.

Perhaps the Arabs should be next on our list, or German refugees from the Civil War? Whatever we decide upon, we can quickly begin to distribute learning materials to all of our citizens that show just what a threat to the Italian way of life that group is.

Fascism after all, is a state focused ideology first and foremost, and if the state is being held back by outdated beliefs then it is within the power of Fascism to throw them out.

However, in cases where the natives prove stubborn and intractable, we will have no choice and should not regret coming down quickly and powerfully.

 ita_expand_the_camps_desc:0 "Just as storms bring the cockroaches and slimy things crawling out from their hideyholes, so too has Italy's recent instability resulted in an apparent windfull for every two-bit con-artist and snake-oil salesman who's ever walked the streets. These scum of the earth, Communists, ultra-fascists and anarchists alike, present a clear and present threat to public safety. \n\nNaturally, the military has already begun rounding up these filthy fools pursuant to its role as the guardian of the Italian Republic. However, it seems that the extent to which this subversive slime has infiltrated the political and media mainstream is greater than we knew. While we've already built several "temporary" holding camps for such malcontents, these venues, along with the conventional jail system are already overcrowded. \n\nIn order to ensure the safety and well being of the Italian nation, Italian soldiers, the Italian people, and the inmates themselves, we will be massively increasing the number of prison camps. Already, scouts and located a number of suitable locations for new internment locations, and have begun construction of barracks and work areas that must precede prisoner transfer."

Just arresting these elements would likely result in a destabilization of public opinion, heavily counter to our short term and long-term goals. \n\nThankfully, there's an easy alternative. Send plain clothes units by night to their homes, and have them safe in a prison camp by daybreak. People may wonder, the neighbors may talk, but at the end of the day this is for their own good. Once encamped, they'll be breaking rocks and fixing tools, a much healthier set of activities than writing subversive articles.\n\n"

Thus, it shouldn't be too surprising that even the military, the bastion of order in these chaotic times, should have a few subversive elements.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Italian soldiery, and certainly the military leadership, have been steadfast in their defence of the republic and the values for which it stands, we have long been aware that there are a few sneaks and spies within our ranks hoping to bring all that we have worked for crashing down. Thankfully, the SIM has a special unit, the Ufficio Difesa, designed to find and eliminate such threats.\n\nGiven that these days the Italian Army is all that stands between the nation and utter chaos, the time has come to massively expand the powers and scope of the UD, and enable them to try malcontent soldiers in special courts of their own devising. While this move may be unpopular, even within the higher echelons of our army, all shall surely see eventually that this move is for the greater good."

Trained for crowd control, well-equipped, spread throughout evenly-distributed stations across the entire country, and - even better - loved by the population because they also act as crime-fighters, the Carabinieri can protect order without being hated for it.\n\nWe should increase the funding and personnel of the Arma, provide them with heavier vehicles such as APCs and light armour, and ensure their presence is even more spread out throughout Italy: while they protect the people from criminals and terrorists, they will also be our eyes and ears on the ground, acting as a quick-response force capable of holding the ground even against large uprisings, until the proper Army arrives."

The goal is ambitious, but success will mean the end for terrorism: we will simulate successes and good results for our infiltrated members, so that they may climb the ranks of the terrorists under the guise of successful leaders, and as soon as they all are where they need to be, they will transmit us all data about all terrorists throughout Italy.\n\nThen, we'll strike, and when the traitors look to their leaders for direction and comfort, they will find out just what a bitter and painful feeling betrayal truly is..."

Officially, we will declare the end of terrorism and lift the martial law, but in truth we will keep fighting, the only difference being that we will play their own game!

There is no room for failure, and therefore, there's even less room for mercy.\n\nWe wish good luck to all those who have given up their identities, their dreams and their loved ones, and accepted to be forever remembered as traitors and terrorists.

However, with the collapse of the Triumvirate, we are left in a very precarious position.\n\nThankfully, all is not lost. With the Mediterranean waters having finished receding, new port cities will not become obsolete in a matter of years.

We must finish modernizing agriculture, and tap into the wealth of industry that Italy holds.

Old farms shall be rejuvenated from near-death, land shall be cleared for new farms, and we shall provide these new farms with modern agricultural equipment! Of course, we will also remind the established farmers that there is much money to be made in not just grain or cereal, but in the finer luxuries.

Thankfully, there are only a few farms that have not been mechanized, so a push to finish modernizing agriculture shouldn't be too expensive. Finishing this modernization of Italian agriculture will be critical to helping advance the Italian economy into the modern era.\n\nOf course, we will not merely uplift those who do not have agricultural technology. We will also help the farmers who have already adopted mechanized agriculture by helping them obtain the newest equipment and tractors, and by teaching them the newest agricultural techniques.

Many Italian railways are beginning to age, and there are too many steam locomotives still in use, especially when diesel and electric trains are objectively superior. We must rectify this issue by modernizing our railway system and by phasing out the old trains. Of course, we cannot focus purely on trains if we are modernizing infrastructure. The Italian roads, the pride and glory of the old Roman Empire, must be modernized as well. New roads shall be built across the Adriatic salt flats, and existing roads shall be upgraded to reflect a new and modern Italy.

It ended up becoming no better than the corrupt capitalist system it replaced, with many Italians still chafing under a corrupt system that cares not for the average Italian.\n\nNo more! Today, Duce Scorza shall speak before the Grand Council of Fascism to announce a new plan to 'correct' the course of fascism. 'True' fascism, he argues, has never been properly tried, but that changes now!

Secondly, the urban unemployed, of whom there are far too many in Italy's great cities. Thirdly, the rural poor, who struggle to get by despite being the ones to feed Italy.

In particular, extra pensions will be given to those who have demonstrated loyalty to the party and country, whether it be by serving in the party itself, the Blackshirts, or otherwise.

Rural families will be provided with financial assistance, tax cuts, competitive advantages, and all manner of boons to ensure that they can live the life they deserve to live!\n\nNot only that, but there's something in it for us, too!

Duce Scorza shall rectify this problem twofold.\n\nFirstly, he will sex up tax barriers to dissuade women from seeking jobs; the most important job they can have is that of a mother, after all.

Surrounded by many enemies, the Empire still stands firm, and stronger than ever. However, much like in the times of Mussolini, internal enemies and dissenters threaten to undermine from within the foundations of the stalwart edifice of the Empire. Rumours of dangerous subversives, infiltrating in all sectors of Italian society, possibly helped by foreign agents, have already reached the ears of the upper echelons of the party, and Duce Scorza has seen it wise to act. Surely, any attempt to destroy the fascist order shall be nipped in the bud."

OVRA will find them, and leave them no chance to escape our righteous punishment."

We must expand and perfect this tried and true system, turning the Colonie into proper concentration camps where we can store hundreds of enemies of the state, rendering them not only innocuous, but also using their labour for the benefit of the fatherland.

Now, the Duce has decided that the PNF must return to be what it was designed to be - a monolithic, indestructible bloc of people who are willing to pledge the utmost personal loyalty to the Duce of fascism.

While useful to repress rabbles, the MVSN is not something we can rely on for more complicated matters - the Regio Esercito, particularly its intelligence and secret services divisions, will be instead put on high alert to deal with disturbances to public order across the empire.

The course ahead is clear enough.

We shall prepare for this by passing a series of laws, making it illegal to leave the household by night except without express permission from above.

No more. The only way to build a strong Italy is to revive the privileges of the ruler, and to obtain the consent or submission of the ruled. We shall do this by solidifying the hierarchy of power in every area of life; whether in the party structure, the military, police, the administration and society generally, we will establish discipline and rank under threat of punitive punishment. By massively increasing punishment for people rebelling against their betters, we will drill into the people a simple truth.

To hold the people of Italy steadfast against atheism and liberalism, to maintain their faith in the natural order of master and servant, and to keep them in submission to God the Father; these are crucial to control the soul of Italy.

We shall let our friends know that we will always have an ear for the concerns of industry, committed as we are to creating wealth and furthering economic growth. Whether this requires us to use words and assurances, or to speak to the industrial bosses in the language they truly understand - suitcases filled with money - is unimportant.

Now that we have prevailed over the petty intrigues of the court, we shall empower our allies around King Umberto even further, purging any remaining liberals and reformists. Shorn of anyone with an inkling of doubt in the fascist renewal, Umberto will fold, as he did all those years ago, and do exactly as our friends tell him.

We know what we must do. There are good men in the middling ranks Army, men overlooked in recent years for being too 'old-fashioned' yet too competent to leave languishing in the lower ranks. It is on these grieved men, torch-carriers for the bellicose spirit of Fascism, that we will remould the Army. We shall encourage the retirement of some older and more high-ranking generals, replacing them with our friends and allies. Yet we will do it in a manner in which no one may protest.

Yet now things will change once and for all, so they can remain the same. In God's name we have built a social order in our country based on piety, hierarchy, unity, and submission to power. For His Glory we will not allow any trace of atheist arrogance, or meaningless talk of individual freedoms, to push us off the path of the faithful.

Now that the liberal spirits of Savoy are dead and buried, we pledge ourselves loyal subjects of the King. So long as Umberto remains true to the ideals of Fascism reborn, a Fascism which will make Italy strong and burn away any branch which would go against us, we will also remain faithful to the Monarchy. We need only remind the Monarch of this arrangement, and everything will fall into place."

For Italy we have shed our blood and sweat. We have thrown everything we had at the enemies without and within, and we are on the cusp now of greatness. Long live Italy! Woe to the vanquished! Long life to its Duce Carlo Scorza, to his idea of an Italy which is stronger than ever before, which is good to Italians and merciless with its enemies! For Italy we march onwards against any nation, any group that is foolish enough to block our path. Through the bowed head of a King was Fascist Italy born decades ago. Through the bowed head of every Italian now will Fascist Italy be reborn."

 ITABOE.1.t:0 "Brawling in Basic"
 ITABOE.1.d:0 "Despite the military's best attempt at maintaining a détente between the royalist and fascist elements of the officer class, the same cannot be said about the rank-and-file. Italy's sons from all walks of life proudly serve in the Army, which means that there is a high chance of soldiers finding out their bunkmate professes some... interesting political theories.\n\nSuch was the case today in a training camp outside of Napoli, where these tensions came to a boiling point and devolved into physical violence. According to the officers' reports, one of the cadets noticed that someone had moved a portrait of the Duce on the wall so that it sits above that of the King. When he loudly demanded to know who did it, the offending cadet proudly stood up and took responsibility. The argument quickly grew heated, punches were thrown, and their squadmates jumped into the fray. While the military police were quickly called to defuse the situation and arrest the instigators, the story has spread rapidly, with some alterations. Fascists are painting it as a brave patriot standing up to a subversive conspiracy, while monarchists insist it was the work of a treasonous cur with no respect for tradition. The government needs to take a stance on the issue, and soon."

 ITABOE.2.t:0 "What's In A Name?"
 ITABOE.2.d:0 "The Regia Marina, our Royal Navy, has proudly patrolled the Mediterranean and defended the shores of our Patria for a century. Many are proud to say they serve, but some are less proud than others. Not because they hate the sea or their homeland, but because of its name. Specifically, the fact that it is the Royal Navy.\n\nA group of very ideologically motivated submarine captains have begun circulating a letter among their comrades, one that descries the monarchist implications of the Regia Marina's name. They accuse it of every single ideological crime under the sun, from undermining sailors' morale to encouraging anti-fascist partisan activity. The letter concludes with a demand that the name be changed "at the early possible convenience of the Grand Council," urging them to "remember that this is the navy of the Italian people and Empire, not a lone Savoyard!" While nobody in the Grand Council has any serious designs to change the Regia Marina's name, some form of response is expected."
 ITABOE.2.a:0 "Dismiss this silly petition at once."
 ITABOE.2.b:0 "Promise to consider it at some point."

 ITABOE.3.t:0 "Hands Down"
 ITABOE.3.d:0 "During a state dinner attended by Prince Ferdinando, duke of Genoa, Prince Filiberto, duke of Pistoia, and Prince Eugenio, duke of Ancona, as well as many members of the military's high command, counter admiral Borghese caused quite a diplomatic stir when he saluted and shook hands with Princes Ferdinando and Filiberto upon their arrival, but conspicuously only shook the hand of Prince Eugenio. When questioned by one of his fellow generals about the action, Borghese replied, "The Prince is only a colonel. In what world should a counter admiral be expected to salute his subordinates?"\n\nNeedless to say, this was not received very well by the rest of the officer corps, and Edgardo Sogno, also present at the dinner, has led the charge in demanding Borghese receive some form of censure for his insubordination. Although Borghese will not receive anything more severe than a slap on the wrist regardless of the outcome-he is too strategically vital-an official stance needs to be taken on whether nobility in the military should receive the same honors as those at the top of the normal hierarchy."
 ITABOE.3.a:0 "He should've shown more respect to his betters."

Of course, now that the post-victory euphoria has subsided, the party must get to work and actually govern. Though naturally, the different factions in the party have varying ideas of what this governing should entail...\n\nWith this in mind, incoming prime minister Aldo Moro has called for the party to have a congress in Rome, to determine the new government's path forward. Will Moro bow to the conservative faction for the sake of electability? Or will he push for a more radical programme like the reformists desire, even if that jeopardizes the government's prospects for the next election? Rome wasn't built in a day, after all."

After opting to listen to the conservative wing of his party, he has, for now, adopted an opportunistic policy of remaining on the fence. This has kept the party together for now, but it is doubtful it can go on forever.\n\nNow, however, Moro must make a choice for the road ahead. Where should his focus lie? Should he focus on building unity in DC and making a stronger, more effective party, even if it jeopardizes future re-election? Or perhaps the best option is to make some deals with the smaller parties in parliament? Whilst this would undoubtedly make it easier for DC to stay in government, there would inevitably be an impact on the government's programme as the smaller parties demand concessions..."

They will expect some concessions in return, whether these are specific policies they want implemented, cabinet positions, or any combination of the two. It will undoubtedly be less effective than if DC were able to govern without a coalition.

However, where some see adversity, Aldo Moro sees opportunity.\n\nThe socialists and even the vast majority of the FD as a whole are greatly preferable to the neo-fascists that comprise the BN, as the socialists are fairly committed as of now to the idea of democracy. Knowing this, Moro has seen fit to reach out a proverbial hand to the socialists to show to the populace that socialism is not an alien idology, but merely another faction of democracy. \n\nWhile reluctant at first, it seems that Moro's efforts have paid off, as even the more conservative parts of DC are willing to be more amicable with the various socialists throughout Italy,opening up the possibility for us to work with the socialists more closely in the future."

They are a part of our party after all.\n\nThis was the general consensus among most of the higher ups in the DC, and when discussions began over coordination, most expected finding a consensus to be very difficult. However, to nearly everyone's surprise, the Primavera faction was incredibly willing to cooperate with the rest of the DC! More than that, the representatives from said faction were much more understanding of the nature of such a compromise than expected. While there have been concessions, such as DC support for some of their more moderate viewpoints, the surprisingly simple ending to this issue has left many in the DC happy."

Furthermore, they promote the strong Catholic values that we as a nation must strive to represent.

Even the desks for pupils, which had been falling apart before, looked like they could actually support the weight of a child!\n\nPietro walked up to the teacher's desk. "Mr. Cirulli," he asked, "where did all this come from?"\n\nMr. Cirulli beamed from ear to ear as he looked down at the young boy. "Why, Pietro, it came from the Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori! They have been doing a grand campaign to provide underprivileged schools like ours with the supplies they need to give young Italians like you the education you deserve! Where do you think your parents got your new shoes and books? They certainly couldn't afford to buy them themselves!"\n\nPietro looked down at his shoes. It was true; the shoes were brand new, well-made, and even somewhat stylish! Considering his previous shoes had been falling to pieces at the seams, it was a most welcome surprise when his ecstatic parents had presented him with the new shoes. And the books in his backpack were certainly too expensive for his working-class parents to afford on their own.\n\n"The CISL did all this?"\n\n"Indeed, my boy!

Ever since she had gone round the building and roped in all of the neighbours, the Condominium B7 Administration Group had become the talk of the entire neighbourhood.\n\nShe had always been outspoken, even as a girl, but only in the past year or so had the neighbours become so as well. The Group, composed mostly of the women living in the building, had been scorned at first by many of the husbands. Then the Group organised a few lunches, solved the problem of waste disposal outside the condominium, convinced the owner to shell out money for maintenance of the property and received the mayor of the district, twice. The husbands stopped complaining. \n\nElena knew the change that had come over her lady friends was neither sudden nor random. Even under Ciano they would not have dared raise such a fuss or involve themselves in politics, however minor. With democracy, however, they had been free to take much of the everyday 'policymaking' into their hands. There were still whispers in neighbouring buildings that she had nothing better to do with her time, but Elena didn't care. She had discovered that organising her peers gave her purpose, and she would not give it up no matter what anyone said.

After looking after the small garden he had improvised with his wife behind the house, he would go with her to the morning Mass before they parted ways; she to her friends in the grocery shops and he to his at the small cafe in the church square. After speaking with them for a while he would buy his two usual newspapers, kept aside for him behind the counter, and sit down absorbed in reading for the rest of the morning.\n\nHe had stuck to this routine for years, but things were no longer the same. The parish priest he remembered since his childhood was old and approaching senility - the poor man sometimes stopped, confused, in the middle of his sermons and seemed lost. His sermons used to rouse Paolo's faith, but now there were only the awkward silences until an altar boy led the old priest mercifully away.\n\nPaolo had expected, with the DC's victory in the election, that politics would be made with the religious fervour he still carried in his heart. He voted for Democrazia Cristiana because he believed a party of the real Italy - Italians raised, like him, in the bosom of Azione Cattolica - could carry the day. But everyday now he read that Aldo Moro - the deceitful coward, Moro - was working with agnostics and socialists. Today the paper spoke of 'Iniziativa Democratica', an alliance Moro had just announced with the Left of the party and whoever he carried with him from the centre. Paolo was angry not only at Moro, who had sabotaged Catholic politics, but at the 'men of values' in the party who let him get away with it. \n\n He left the newspaper on the table and went back to his house. He had not given up on Democrazia Cristiana yet - who else could he vote for? But the fervour with which he spoke for them in the past had withered away long ago."

He had already been skeptical of the government's plan to introduce new denominations of 500 lire banknotes when the government had announced the plan.

At worst, he claimed, it could lead to an economic bubble.\n\nAnd all bubbles must eventually burst.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of the skepticism expressed by economists such as Mario, the government had decided to go ahead with the plan and print the new banknotes. Now that they were being widely circulated, it seemed certain that they were here to stay, and the lira would be further inflated. Whilst this had increased spending and consumption, could it continue like this forever?\n\nMario did not want a bubble.

I'll be able to get the conservatives to support our programme one way or the other. You just need to give the green light, and without restraints I will be able to herd them into supporting us, by any means necessary."\n\n"Perhaps," Moro responded, "but that will undoubtedly make it harder for our party to be re-elected if your plan of coercion and implied expulsion from the party goes ahead. I want to keep this in-house as much as possible too, but we must think of the future elections. Working with Nenni on a common reform programme will certainly make it easier on that front."\n\n"Aldo, come on.

We both know the threat from the north necessitates action NOW. Just give the word, and I shall make it happen."\n\nMoro's brow continued to furrow as he stopped walking to ponder Fanfani's words.

A sea of Democrazia Cristiana's representatives looked back at him, men of every shade of political persuasion, from reformed fascists and monarchists to those different from the moderate socialist bloc only by their chosen affiliation. Moro could not suppress a twinge of pride in this wide tent they had built, and then his eyes met those of Giulio Andreotti. Guilio smiled at him and nodded, encouraging, demanding. Democrazia Cristiana was by far the widest of the coalitions present in Parliament, but - Moro exhaled slowly and steeled himself - today it would become narrower. \n\n"I am proud because I am a Christian democrat," he began. "Our fellow representatives in the other parties are divided between themselves and speak only for parts of the society. This is their right." The usual heckling, sounds of approval from every DC faction represented. Moro continued speaking. "Christian democracy is a representation of the whole of our society. Before God we build a politics, every day, founded in our religious and social values and which will better the life of every Italian family. Some of our opponents, looking for something to attack us for, say we compromise excessively and do not stand by what we claim to be our beliefs." Already the Parliamentarians started to react accordingly, but Moro kept going. "Yet we know what our beliefs are. Democrazia Cristiana is.." He almost faltered. "A party for democracy, unity and values, and opposed to the destructiveness and division of the Left." \n\n As the Parliament broke out in whispers, Moro narrowed his eyes at the paper laying before him on the podium. Mentally he made immediate adjustments, crossing out 'a malicious atheist attack on the family', 'assassins of democracy', substituting 'against our families' beliefs', 'misguided beliefs which can only harm democracy'. Aldo Moro looked up and threw a surveying glance around the room. Andreotti and the Primavera group nodding approvingly, the left faction looking angry and whispering while shooting daggers with their eyes. The Fronte Democratico representatives, ready to stand up and start shouting but curious to see how the speech would develop. The PSDI, sitting among them, looking more intrigued than angry. And across from the leftists, Almirante, flashing him a full toothed grin which sent a shiver down his spine. Moro kept going. \n\n"We stand against the Fronte Democratico, against the Left, because their beliefs are against our families' beliefs. They are not what Italy wants or needs, and whilst there are good men among them," Another edit, a slight grimace from Andreotti - "It is clear that their beliefs are badly misguided, and will only do harm to our young democracy. Perhaps they will call us conservative for saying so, opposed to reform, but we are the true reformers. Democrazia Cristiana represents the true centre of Italy, the soul of tens of millions of Italians and their families. Based on our values, and their values, and willing to fight the Left on the political battlefield, we will change Italy for the better and give its children a life better even than what we ourselves will enjoy." \n\nUproarious applause from Andreotti's corner, with every conservative member of the party on their feet clapping. Almirante and his fascists whistling and applauding, only half mockingly. The members of the Fronte Democratico jeering, calling him a Big Business puppet, an enemy of the worker and a fascist, while Saragat's moderates whispered quickly to one another. But Moro did not have eyes for any of them. He looked only at the leftists of Democrazia Cristiana, and noted how they sat there sullenly with anger in their eyes. Betrayal. Moro left the podium and went back to his seat, shaking hands and smiling absent-mindedly. Andreotti clapped him on the back and said, into his ear, "We have won a great victory today.""

However, there is a way we could neuter the threat posed by them.\n\nThere is a significant contingent of monarchists in the BN, who like their conservatism and authoritarianism, whilst caring less about the whole fascism thing. Though obviously, their primary concern is the preservation of the Italian monarchy.\n\nWe can use this to our advantage and sow division in the ranks of the BN. We shall spread rumors (which may have merit, for all we know) that the BN seeks to restore fascism, and abolish the monarchy in the process! We could say they seek to do this as 'revenge' against Umberto for his part in the democratization of Italy.\n\nBy planting this rumor, true or not, in the mind of the monarchists, we will wreak havoc on the BN unity.

After the unification of Italy in 1861, the administrative divisions were kept small, consisting of Comuni (municipalities) and provinces (groups of Comuni).\n\nThis was all well and good, but our glorious nation has grown tremendously since then. This has necessitated more Comuni and provinces, and it has lead to the national government having to micromanage hundreds of different divisions, which is frankly nightmarish to administer. Hence the introduction by the Democrazia Cristiana government of a new administrative division: Regioni.\n\nThese regioni will consist of groupings of provinces that share a common history and/or heritage. It will decentralize a small amount of power from the national government to the regioni, but it will minimize micromanagement and allow the government's laws to be applied uniformly. It's not quite full-on federalism, but by devolving some powers to the regioni it will strengthen our country.\n\nOf course, not everyone is happy about this. The more authoritarian-minded forces in parliament are outraged at the idea of devolving even the tiniest bit of power to regional governments. The Blocchi Nazionale in particular are beside themselves, with their leader, Almirante, filibustering parliament for a record eight consecutive hours!

The radicals, on the other hand, want to strongarm the rest of the Parliament to vote on their reforms, radically transforming Italy into a socialist state, something which, if not executed with caution, may trigger reactions from forces we know little about...\n\nThe choice is difficult, but we must decide: let the ballots speak!"

 FD.1.t:0 "A Writer's Conundrum" # XXV Congress, decision on SocDem or LibSoc empowering
 FD.1.d:0 "Enzio sat hunched over his desk.  His notes laid out scattered all over the finely crafted wood, spilling over onto the polyester carpet.  He had collected a copious amount of material on the two ideological giants battling it out for control over the Fronte Democratico.  If he were to read them all off in succession, even the long-gone and long-winded Duce himself would keel over from boredom.  All the same, Enzio knew he had to at least try to make something out of his literary collection.\n\nIn his interactions with Saragat, Enzio was taken back by how approachable the man was.  His whole demeanor was very calming.  He didn't yell or scream or shout ideological dogma at Enzio.  Whatever question Enzio had related to the party's platform Saragat was more than willing to explain, in great detail, his outline for the future.  From Enzio's perspective, he saw a man committed not only to himself, like so many other politicians. Saragat was committed to democracy and to the Italian people.  An honorable man in a cut-throat field.\n\nNenni however, what a contrast.  If Enzio felt a sense of paternal comfort around Saragat, Nenni represented a father's rage.  Rage against the injustices still present within Italy and its government.  Nenni also had no qualms preaching to Enzio about how socialism, and socialism alone, would save Italy from backsliding into fascism. While Enzio was not fully convinced by the rhetoric, he couldn't help but be inspired by Nenni's commitment to his ideals.  A socialist Italy still seemed unimaginable, almost impossible with a gentleman like Saragat.  But with a firebrand like Nenni at the helm...\n\nEnzio went back to peering over his notes, determined to finish his column before morning."

 FD.2.t:0 "Saragat Prevails" # Prima la Democrazia
 FD.2.d:0 "All of Rome today - or at least, the part of it with a taste for politics, which was everyone nowadays - could talk of nothing else. Giuseppe Saragat had prevailed in the factional struggle for control of the Fronte Democratico, and was named Secretary of the group, with Pietro Nenni to act as President.\n\nA moderate man, both in character and in his politics, Giuseppe Saragat had in the past years fostered a reputation of ruthless calculation. Having prevailed, members of the Saragat faction now exposed their internal disagreement in presenting two plans on the way forward to Nenni.\n\nThe first path was the more moderate one - working with Democrazia Cristiana directly, pooling the energy of the moderating forces in both the FD and the DC, and forming a social democratic government supported by Aldo Moro. Despite his willingness to sit with conservative and monarchist members in his group, Moro was a known compromiser, and a Nenni-Saragat-Moro pact could well achieve much for social democratic politics. Such a pact would also help reduce opposition from conservative elements in Italy, and strongly increase our ability to deliver an effective programme. The clear downside, however, would be the reaction in the Fronte Democratico. An alliance with Moro would be seen as a capitulation by many voters, badly damaging the FD's chance at reelection. \n\n The other option was purer, and carried more risk. The path of socialist unity would have us form a government made only of the FD, creating a moderate left bloc which could implement our vision of Italy without any alliance with the Christian Democrats. This policy, for obvious reasons, would make our re-election far more likely - it is what people voted for, after all - and the healing of rifts in the socialist front would allow the government to work in stability. Yet the risk would have to be kept in mind. After all, conservative elements in the country would be disturbed by the prospect of a socialist bloc in power.\n\nWith the FD's factions waiting impatiently, Nenni finally came to a decision:"
 FD.2.a:0 "A Red-White alliance with Moro, for a stable and effective government." # Empower Strength, low reelection, meh terror
 FD.2.b:0 "A government of socialist unity and democracy, for the people of Italy!" # Strengthen Party, high reelection, strong terror

Nice of them to pick a round one, he thought, but then again, Moro was under no illusions. The men stood up as he approached and shook his hand, then sat down and ordered their coffee. Nenni was the first to speak: "Not everyone in the party is happy we're meeting you," he said gruffly, and Moro met him with a small smile. A test? Then Nenni laughed, and they got to business. \n\nThe next few hours went by in a consistent manner - Nenni talked a good deal, Saragat talked less and said more, and Moro talked enough. By the end of it everything was as clear as could be and a coalition agreement was on the table. Moro was pleasantly surprised to note his interlocutors did not agree on everything. They all came away with something they could sell to their people, and parted with an appointment to meet again very soon. \n\nIt had gone well, Moro noted as he left the café. But Nenni had been reasonable, and every time he wasn't Saragat steered the conversation back to their areas of agreement. In any case, it was only compromising, and Moro had squeezed as much as he could. The easy part was over."

The Socialist Party, bowing and scraping to royals! Can you imagine!

He persuaded us to work with Saragat and his social democrats for the good of the people.  And now look where we are! The goddamn Christian Democrats might as well have won the election, the way our programs are turning out. I am sick of compromising with these idioti! The fottuti pazzi who will simply lead us back into the arms of another Mussolini!"\n\n"I agree with you, Vincenzo, this is unacceptable. It would have been one thing if this was the only point of compromise. Or even one of a few.  But it seems like with each passing day, we become less of a party of socialism and more of a party of bourgeois niceties!  Something should be done."\n\n"Perhaps Paulo, but as for now we follow the party's lead.  If things go too far, maybe then we can consider restoring the peoples' will within the halls of our cowardly government."\n\nThe two went back to discussing the future of the party - and the future of Italy."

Despite this, the FD as a whole had an interest in adding them to the coalition; every additional seat helped, and their moderate and anti-fascist credentials were not in doubt . \n\n Trying to stop the PRI's entry into the FD, Party President Oronzo Reale made his last political blunder. In a quickly arranged vote, the party ousted him as president and elected Ugo La Malfa in his place, with the latter immediately approving the PRI's entry into the coalition.

But the failure of the Partito d'Azione hit him hard. To a hushed gathering of his closest allies he had broken the news they were all expecting: the PdAz, having listened to the voters, would be dissolved for the greater good of socialism and freedom in Italy. Now all that remained would be to pack everything up and wait for the phone to ring.\n\nParri was not so cynical as to think the phone calls from Pietro Nenni and Giuseppe Saragat were dishonest. Both men, despite their differences, respected his struggle against fascism and had told him so in person. But he was not so naïve as to think this was the only reason they were calling. Depending on their beliefs the former members of the party would flock in two directions, the more radical to the PSI and the more moderate to the PSDI. Parri knew that the Left would be stronger, all in all, in having one less faction within it to compete with. But there was also something to mourn in the party's demise. Against all hope he had thought he could be a bridge builder for socialist voters. But this was not to be."

 FD.7.d:0 "According to an official memorandum issued by the Fronte Democratico leadership, secretary Pietro Nenni has approved the expulsion of several prominent members of the left wing of the Socialist Party, including well known Marxist ideologue Enrico Berlinger.  The memorandum states the cause of this expulsion was due to the ever-increasing radicalization of the left of the party, and its dissatisfaction with the "constant capitulation to the moderates and the Christian Democrats''.  While Enrico Berlinger was not available for comment, many of his supporters, led by other party deputies who were also expelled, have taken to the streets in protest against the "political puppets of the bourgeoisie".  Police units have been mobilized and are conveying at the scene of the largest protests currently taking place.  Although they have been ordered to only watch and ensure the protests do not spiral out of control, it is clear that the Socialist's Party's decision to expel the radicals may not have had the stabilizing effect they were hoping for.\n\nPietro Nenni issued a statement on the matter, ensuring that these protests were made up of mostly foolish students with too much time on their hands and their irresponsible ringleaders; the expelled party members.  He went on to express his confidence in the Party and made it clear "...in no uncertain terms... the party shall not split over the ravings and poutings of a few radicals."

He stood tall, chin out and chest-puffed.\n\n"That ought to bring the house down!" Nenni thought as he gasped for air, his voice cracked and his throat parched from spouting off rhetoric for the past 15 minutes.  For days Nenni made sure every page, every paragraph, every sentence, and every syllable of his speech was perfect!  He refused to recite nothing but his most truthful and analytical thoughts when speaking, especially on the topic of politics. If he was to secure Italian socialism against its political enemies, it was imperative Nenni built his support among the working class. The workers had to be made to understand the important role the PSI played in empowering them. Once they were made to see this, no doubt due to his impeccable oratory skills, the workers would unilaterally fall in line with the PSI party program. So when this crowd of workers gathered in the TV studio audience returned nothing more than a few whimpering whistles and scattered applause, Nenni could only stand aghast. Frozen in shock, like a deer in headlights, he regained enough courage to gather his papers and exit frame before the feed cut.\n\nNenni could not comprehend how his speech and charisma failed to inflame the workers' passions. Thankfully, Giuseppe Saragat made an appearance on the very same program and was able to win over the crowd's affection. Nenni pondered how Saragat, much more moderate and soft-spoken compared to himself, could have captured the hearts and minds of the working class assembled in the TV studio. And not just there either. All over the nation it seemed his fiery prose, meant to set hearts on fire, was overshadowed by Saragat's gentler and straight-talking attitude. It slowly dawned on Nenni that he was slowly but surely becoming an accessory to the real rising star of the party, Guiseppe Saragat."

Roberto's hand ached from spending the last couple hours diligently and methodically recording as much as he could at the opening Italian congress. He had already run through two pens, and now with the last drop of ink  had used up a third. Still, it was important he covered the congress as thoroughly as possible. Gatherings like this didn't happen so often, and a journalist of Roberto's stature even rarer got the privilege to attend such a historic event.\n\nThe Americans from the National Progressive Party (what a curious name) seemed to get along with all the other delegates and attendees, Roberto included. He shook hands with a, oh what was the name, Roberto struggled to piece together the words. Ah yes, Michael Harrington, a very nice gentleman. Guiseppe Saragat seemed to think so as well. The two were damn near inseparable, discussing who knows what.  Probably their favorite social or economic reform. What a couple of bleeding-hearts.\n\nRoberto had a harder time interacting with the delegates from India and Azad Hind. They seemed more, - Roberto couldn't think of the expression. They were more on edge. Perhaps they were not so easily impressed with the congress. Roberto could see their point.  For all its fanfare and triumphant hailings of the beginning of the end for the fascisti, there remained much to be desired. Only time would tell if this congress truly was the beginning of a sincere and lasting union of solidarity. Sheik Mujibur Rahman, in his address to the congress, seemed to summarize Roberto's more pessimistic feelings on the matter. "It's not over yet."\n\nThe Japanese delegates, of all the  attendees, were the most optimistic about the gathering. Roberto found their speech, about hope for a freer world and their country to atone for its shameful and brutal past, a truly inspiring moment for the congress. It was, however, topped only by Oliver Tambo's bombastic speech. Roberto was moved by his stories of resistance against the reichskommissariats and the struggle of liberation his people fought for everyday. If a man like Tambo can so vigorously fight on against the fascisti, then maybe this truly was the beginning of the end for them.

"When going to vote, the Italian voter will have more choice. The voter can, if they wish, still vote for candidates from one party as before. But under the new system, the voter can also choose a candidate from one party and give their vote to another party. The system also allows the voter to vote for multiple candidates from different parties, or if they prefer, to write in the names of.." Matteo leaned in closer still, feeling dazed. He remembered asking the local priest for advice the first time he voted, not on political preference, but on how not to spoil the ballot. Now RAI was saying you could write on the ballot and it would be counted.\n\nThe radio crackled. "Under the changed rules, voters' choices will no longer be tied to the political party itself, but to the candidates they want elected.

While the World Peace Council was to a large extent his brainchild, there was always the worry that it could backfire spectacularly. His main worry was the number of translators roaming around, chatting with each other in English and exchanging notes. Surely this much whispering, during his speech to inaugurate the Council, would detract from the fiery relevance of his words?\n\nHe need not have worried. The audience, a varied assortment of activists, academics and diplomats, listened attentively with their eyes fixed on him as translators whispered into their ear. Sanzō Nosaka, the Japanese communist whose entry into the room had caused a stir, was nodding vigorously to his colleague's whispers. As he spoke Nenni, picked out other figures he had been informed about by his advisers. From the US Dorothy Day, a Catholic pacifist, and a folk singer called Phil Ochs. From Britain Hugh Brock, a journalist, and from Spain Llorenzo Vidal Vidal, a writer. Many of his countrymen he recognized himself - Ernesto Balducci, a dissident priest, had come up to him and shaken his hand. Whilst the relative lack of politicians of much import stung at first, Nenni would see it later on as a blessing. The people in this room would talk freely, caring for the best ideas and not for national interests, and just perhaps, the seed sown here would be the beginning of a wider legacy. Something rarely felt in Nenni's life surfaced, a sense of humility.

Ever since the Italians had managed to reform into a democracy, she had watched with ever mounting horror as the Italians had somehow managed to pick the socialists of all people to lead their nation.\n\nOf course, she'd understood why. The Italian people were greatly disillusioned with fascism, and therefore swung hard in the opposite direction the second they'd had the chance. In any case, it seemed as if the FD had brought a new tomorrow to Italy. Her job had expanded greatly, as the American government took a much greater interest in Italy. The government had only grown in popularity as its new programs had managed to raise employment levels beyond projections. To most people, Luce's fears would've seemed like paranoid mongering.\n\nHowever, Luce knew better. It was almost too easy in this day and age to make things seem much better than they were. The improved employment was nothing but a sham, an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Italian people. These leftists had a sinister goal in mind that it seemed only Luce could see: the implementation of a communist dictatorship. The communist FD needed the will of the people in order to achieve their goal, and their pathetic lies were how they earned it. For now sadly, all Luce could do is grin and bear it, as an anticommunist coup at this juncture could only lead to the country sliding towards communism. Hopefully, the Italian people would free themselves from this menace, just as they had from fascism."

 FD.16.d:0 "A new worksite was being set up just outside the city. Like many others, it was the work of the publicly owned Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, an inheritance from the early days of Fascism now in the hands of a socialist government. Maurizio, a leftist himself, remembered following the discussion over the IRI when some more economically liberal members of the PNF raised the issue of privatization. But they had been shut down, and thank God for that. Now Maurizio was to oversee this construction, one of the largest automobile factories in Italy once it was built. He had not been surprised when they chose him, since his experience in the construction industry was well known, but was grateful nonetheless to-be given this, his biggest project so far. He supposed, in a moment of wry reflection, that he was a public official now. Maybe he should have someone stitch an Italian flag into his shirt!\n\nMaurizio dragged an elbow against his damp forehead. It was a hot day. He walked around leisurely, shouting instructions and keeping an eye out for the new builders. They had needed to fetch some people from the outside and there were disagreements with his men at first, but Maurizio tried to stifle arguing as it happened. He was happy with the extra hands, which would speed up the factory's opening, and it was good when something like this created more work. God knew work was not something which could be taken for granted, even in good times for the economy such as this one. So when one of the new builders made a very stupid mistake and cost them some of the construction materials, Maurizio had stood up for him and saved the man his job. Even as they grumbled, he could see the men respected him for it. Now morale was better than ever, and the kid who made the mistake learned quickly. All was well.\n\nA more economically minded man would have pointed to a larger pattern, saying that complex merging policy decisions had made the current building boom, with IRI opening worksites all over the country and creating prosperity wherever it did. Maurizio did not care too much for this bigger picture, but he appreciated that the men in Rome did, and that his guidance would translate a larger vision into something on the ground. A glittering testimony to the Italian worker, and if he had anything to do with it, the envy of all Italy."

The factory shifts had actually gotten shorter and his pay had increased significantly, both to Matteo's pleasant surprise.  As he turned the corner, he found himself back in his neighborhood. Only, things were not quite the same as he remembered.\n\nThe streets were cleaner and the buildings had a gentler shine to them.  It reminded Matteo of that old American movie his father showed him so long ago. The one with the tin-man and the long windy road.  Mateo noticed more of his neighbors out-and-about as well. Never in his life could he recall anyone daring to walk the streets beyond going to work or taking a quick trip to the grocers.  And even then, it was best to be quick about it, to avoid any trouble. Such fears seem so misplaced, the way people were carrying on.  As Matteo made his way to his front door, he overheard so many lighthearted conversations.  People chattering about how much better their pay is now compared to before.  How a few months ago everyone was barely meeting their rent, let alone paying off bills like electricity or utilities. Now, it seems that those troubles have passed.  One could even believe, though they would be wrong, that these hardships might have never even existed for Matteo and his neighbors.\n\nMatteo, with a quicker step than before and standing tall, made his way into his apartment building.  He was not very politically active and didn't even care much about "democracy" or whatever else the students were shouting about these days. Yet as he made his way to his room, he reflected on all the recent changes he spotted today; changes that came about through democracy and through reforms made by the Democratic Front.

 FD.20.d:0 "As the result of the vote was read out, rapturous applause broke out in the benches next to him. A somewhat stunned Enrico Berlinguer was proclaimed Secretary of the PSI, but quickly recovered and vowed to all in the room that socialism in Italy would prevail.\n\nYoung and charismatic enough to fire up the youth and the workers, yet tactful enough to win over mature members of the Fronte Democratico, Berlinguer's win fired up Rome with elation and disgust in equal measure. In building on the momentum of this victory Nenni's task now was to choose between two approaches, with differing degrees of radicalism.\n\nThe first approach would, whilst radical itself, see us working within the bourgeois system. Focusing our political efforts against the fascists of the Blocchi Nazionali, appealing to workers directly, and using the tools afforded us by the Constitution, we would forge socialism in the Italian way. If even this was too far for Saragat and his social democrats, who had been grumbling darkly since their loss, then Saragat be damned. This approach would keep the party's voting base behind us and strengthen our government, even as conservative elements in the country would do everything to undermine us.\n\nYet there were those who say this would not be enough, and Nenni is inclined to listen. The enemies of socialism in Italy would be against a Nenni-Berlinguer government no matter what, and could step in to destroy the socialist project. We could, then, seize the moment, and wage a revolution won through the ballot. By weakening the King and the armed forces, and rallying the people behind us, we could outwit the enemies of socialism and destroy their power over Italy forever. Only then could our beloved country be free of the fascists once and for all, so we can create a better Italy with no one holding us back!\n\nWith the party's intrigues complete, Nenni called Berlinguer to him to discuss his decision."

While the recent election results did not turn out the way Luca was hoping, he was sure that the Democratic Front would surely collapse like the pitiful house of cards they are.  Then, Italy could be saved from the dastardly socialists.\n\nBut this...this was a debilitating and humiliating betrayal to Luca, and the party.  How could Moro do this?  Enter into talks with a known communist?  What's there to talk about?  How to cripple the economy?  Perhaps how to further secularize the nation and dismiss the Holy Father's authority?  Berlinguer is a dangerous radical who should have been sent packing long ago.

The statue was defaced with egregious and indecent remarks that are not worth repeating in this publication.  Besides the inflammatory remarks, radical political statements covered the statute as well: "Viva La Repubblica Socialista!", "Abbasso Umberto!", and "Morte Ai Fascisti."  The students whereabouts are currently unknown; local police units are issuing an award for the location of these hostile persons.\n\nThe Blocchi Nazional, Democrazia Cristiana, and even moderates from Fronte Democratico have all called on Pietro Nenni to condemn this horrendous stunt.  Nenni, believed to be the inspiration for this and similar occurrences because of his inflammatory rhetoric, issued a statement on the matter this afternoon.  Standing in front of the parliament building he condemned the "immature and baseless acts" of a "few overzealous students."  In the same speech, Nenni quickly pivoted to condemning recent provocations made by the Blocchi Nazional, going so far as to blame the party for the recent acts of vandalism.  He stated that if they were not so "pig-headed" and "aggravatingly obtuse"; such "spontaneous undertakings" would be far more "sporadic and restrained."  This has upset the Blocchi Nazional to no end; calling for action to be taken against Nenni for his remarks and dismal condemnation of the students."

While the rally, for the most part, proceeded throughout the night without incident; several arrests were made and a score of officers were sent to the hospital.\n\nThe rally had been planned in advance for weeks, organized by Fronte Democratico supporters.  The purpose of the rally was to celebrate the programs established and laws passed by the newly elected government . While the plan was to have the rally be attended by several unions and political organizations, including known radical Enrico Berlinguer and his supporters; word of the demonstration quickly spread.  By the night of the event, several student orgs. And thousands of workers spontaneously demonstrated their support by holding rallies of their own, or joining in on the official assembly.  The tone of the rally quickly shifted to a more militant one; due to the influx of extremists at the event, spurred on by Berlinguer, who radicalized the crowd.  Soon, workers were shouting pro-socialist slogans and demanding further major reforms to be implemented by the government; while still praising and honoring Fronte Democratico for its success so far.\n\nPolice units were called in to break up parts of the rally and to reign in the radicals who were inciting the crowd.  This led to several altercations; many of them turning violent.  One such including a young student being subdued and detained by an officer, before several workers shouting anti-police slogans assaulted the officer and freed the youth.  Still, such cases were extremely limited and the rally was mostly unaffected by the police presence.\n\nBy the end of the assembly, Pietro Nenni made an appearance; humbly accepting the "groundswell of popular support" he and his party members had "graciously earned" from the Italian people.  He stood atop a makeshift platform constructed for the event, along with several other Fronte Democratico members.  Enrico Berlinguer was also present among the celebrated party members.  He later went on to express his "cautious optimism for the future of the party"; implying that Fronte Democratico, due to its recent success and outpouring of support, may very well implement more comprehensive reforms in the near future."

But his colleague was only laughing bitterly. "Nenni won't reinstate anything. His people have him by the neck, he can't be seen taking a step back.

The sudden call to the palace didn't sit well upon his mind: when he passed the law for the first, failed, referendum on the monarchy, nothing had transpired from the Quirinale, not even the smallest rumour or whisper. Dead silence. Therefore, it came as a great surprise that, now that he had passed the law for a second referendum to be held, the King had summoned him with all due fanfare.\n\nWhile he waited in front of the closed doors, he thought about it. Did he want to bargain? Was he going to abdicate? Yes! That was it, he wanted to officially recognise the right for the Italian people to choose its fate, free from crowns and shackles. The doors opened, and he entered the room. Umberto II, King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia, stood behind his ornate desk. "Welcome, Prime Minister, please have a sit" the King said, a kind smile on his lips. Nenni opened his mouth to speak, but the King was faster: "Your Ma-" "There will be no new referendum" The politician's eyes went wide. "That's impossible! The parliament has voted!" Umberto's voice and expression became hard: "With the powers given to me by the Albertine Statute, I refuse to promulgate the law, and hereby remove you from your office" "But wha-" "Did you ever consider the implications of such an action? Did you ever think about the consequences of turning from a fascist dictatorship into a socialist one?"\n\nNenni tried to explain, but suddenly two armed commandos entered the room. The King spoke once more, his voice strained by barely contained rage "You are a small man with an even smaller intellect: you may have spent months preparing for this political charade, but I have spent ten years preparing for democracy to return to Italy, and I will suffer no interlopers". Then, he looked at the soldiers: "Bring him away. Tell general De Lorenzo to commence execution of Piano Solo". The soldier saluted: "Yes, Your Majesty!" and brought the former Prime Minister away."

What made them finally take notice was when, the next minute, dozens of Carabinieri in mimetic uniform stormed Italy's political heart.No shots were fired. There was no need: politicians and party officers are not known for their military training, after all. When the first screams echoed in the corridors, there was at first surprise, then worry, and finally, panic.\n\nEveryone started running, to what they didn't know, but surely away from the men in camo uniform. Some, still remembering the days of the underground resistance, quietly slipped into secret corridors littering the ancient palace, but most weren't that lucky. Half an hour later, with Palazzo Chigi and the Parliament secured, hundreds of Carabinieri in more ordinary uniform came in dozens transport vans, filling them with ministers, MPs, party officers, bureaucrats, some still in formal dress, crowded like common criminals and sent to pre-selected reclusion structures. Some MPs from the DC, strangely untouched by the mayhem, protested with the officers now patrolling the empty corridors of what was once the beating heart of democracy, but all got the same answer: "The parliament is closed until further orders, we are not authorised to disclose confidential information".\n\nLess than an hour after Nenni's arrest, the operation was complete, but the true plan had just been set in motion: the gears of an ancient engine, rusted and rigid after years of stillness, suddenly jumped alive as if electrocuted, shedding the rust and revealing the cold, merciless steel beneath it."

They weren't soldiers, but much worse, for the SIM, the feared Servizio di Informazione Militare, had their headquarters there.\n\nThe nearer one got to a certain room on the fourth underground floor, the tighter the security became: that room was the heart of the SIM, filled with knowledge so terrible it could never become public. The gravitational centre of all activity was a small table where a single man, dressed in high uniform of the Carabinieri, held a sealed folder in his hands: the man knew it, for he had sealed it personally years ago, at the behest of the last Duce of Fascism. "Ciano's final legacy", he thought, but the name on the old label was much more mundane, nine crudely stamped letters which would change Italy forever, to protect the young democracy from extremists and traitors.\n\nAn operative brought a telegram, awakening him from his reflection: "King secured. Activation order given. Parliament stormed. Communists arrested. Some fleeing. FD offices stormed. Unnecessary losses avoided. Non-hostile personnel spared. Requesting further instructions". The man in high uniform nodded, and returned his gaze to the folder: once opened, there would be no turning back, for orders, no matter how old or terrible, are still orders. Giovanni De Lorenzo broke the cover's seal, the letters glinting under the artificial light: "PIANO SOLO", because when De Lorenzo had asked who would participate, Ciano had answered "Solo i Carabinieri".

It seemed everyone was gathered all at once in the lounge, desperate for any sort of news about the recent political events that had transpired.  Dante and all his friends, though it seemed like everyone these days, was a committed socialist.  After years of fascism, though Dante knew he never suffered like his parents did under the tyrant Mussolini, the country had transitioned to democracy.  Due to the further liberalization of the government and its laxing of political restrictions, Dante and thousands of his fellow students were exposed to ideals they had never heard of before.  Ideals like the works of Karl Marx, Amadeo Bordiga, and Antonio Gramsci.  Contemporary figures such as Enrico Berlinguer were, miraculously, able to capture Dante and his compatriot's newfound radicalism and channel it into a more tightly honed expression of discontent.  But it seems, despite all the political education and organizing on the part of the students, it was all going out the window.  But Dante didn't care.  For the triumphant moment of the working class had come.  Or at least Dante hoped.  Because just as easily things could go south, really fast.  Hence, the ever overcrowding lobby full of socialist radicals of all-stripes.  What was taking them so damn long?  And then as if on cue, the screen flashed and the two men Dante was expecting appeared on screen.  Dante held his breath as... his fears were calmed and hopes sent skyrocketing through the roof.\n\nHis confident smirk transformed into a wide-smile as Pietro Nenni heralded a new age for Italy.  There was Berlinguer, standing side by side with Nenni, the powerful imagery not escaping Dante.  The two most popular socialist figures of Italy, standing exultantly next to each other like old comrades, represented the now fully unified working class who were mobilized against the forces of capital.  The disparagement political parties now under the single commanding banner of socialist liberation!  With a leap out of his seat, Dante gathered his friends around him.\n\n"Now is the time!  It is our duty to aid comrade Berlinguer and the working class in ushering in this new era of Italian Socialism!"  Dashing out of the building, followed first by a few, then a whole swarming mass of fellow students, Dante made for the nearby town square.  There, right in the center, stood a 7.62 metered flagpole.  The flag of the old order flying limply in the air.  Dante, with all the vigor he could muster, climbed to the top.  As he was climbing, he called out for a plain red banner.  With the banner of working people in one hand, he tore off the old Italian flag, and replaced it with the banner of the future.  Clinging to the top, Dante could see for miles around other squares and poles, the lowering of the old flag and the raising of the red banner. Yet some, if not more, still flew the old national flag proudly along with the banner of socialism.  Truly, the peoples' will was ascendant in his country.  And Dante couldn't be more pleased."

The Democrazia Cristiana, on the other hand has remained very, very, quiet on the matter.\n\nOf course, we must remember the victory of the BN was not due to a single party, but rather a coalition. While Almirante himself leads the MSI, the core of the coalition, there are many different factions, including the national conservatives in the MSI led by Arturo Michelini, the monarchist PDIUM, and a various collection of smaller parties to the right of even the more fascist faction of the MSI.

This would help maintain our electibility, but there are fears that party infighting could lead to such a government being ineffective. On the other hand, we could form an unofficial alliance with the DC by moving more in the conservative direction as compared to the fascist direction.

The truth of the matter is that the good Count has far more in common with us than with any of our immediate rivals. Perhaps he may not agree with all of our more... zealous members, but such is the benefit of being a big tent party.

 BN.1.t:0 "The Future of Fascism" # Post Ciano Fascism
 BN.1.d:0 "The discussion at the main headquarters of the party started to get more heated. With the electoral victory of the Blocchi Nazionali, the high-ranking members reunited to discuss what should be the next steps. The moderate wing argued that the BN should respect the new democratic institutions to consolidate its own power, while the hardliner wing argued for a return to the glory days of fascism without any kind of compromises. After many accusations of "defeatism" and "lack of vision" on both sides, it became clear that there was no real plan or political agenda to follow the victory at the elections. "The political landscape has changed. I stand for the fascsist principles like anyone in this room, but we need to adapt to this new reality. Pragmatism is a necessary evil for our movement to survive." De Marsanich argued. "Nonsense. The movement is strong by itself. We need to crush these weak socialists and restore order like we did decades ago." answered Rauti passionately. Lauro eventually joined the feud. "I understand that sometimes compromise is necessary but we can't sell our ideals like this. Democracy is the enemy of fascism not its friend!"\n\n Eventually, everyone started to scream at each other without coming to any agreement. Rauti even requested Almirante to expel the moderates from the party for "treason to the fascist cause". Growing increasingly tired after hours of loud noise in that hot small room, Almirante slammed his fist into the table. "Enough of this! We are supposed to be the vanguard of fascism, not a bunch of screaming animals." Silence invaded the room, as Almirante finally made his decision. "I already made up my mind about what is the best course of action for fascism and I hope you'll respect my decision as Prime Minister and head of the party."

Undoubtedly, it was a more relaxing location than the suffocating tiny room from the prior reunion. The atmosphere was more positive now that most of the hardliners decided not to go in protest. Almirante planned for a more informal reunion at the sauna with his colleagues to relax a bit and laugh about the old times. But for a fascist, the duty always comes first. The congress of that day had the objective of reconsidering a coalition with the Democrazia Cristiana, discussing the possibility of a joint legislative agenda. n/n"While our party still remains strong after the last elections, we may need support from the Democrats for our next projects. Besides, the Socialists could represent a threat and everyone in this room can agree that we don't want them to push their libertine agenda. Right, Mr Andreotti?" De Marsanichi exposed. \n\n"Uh, sure. Our party appreciates that the Blocchi Nazionale was willing to approach us in the first place. If we can compromise on our...small differences, I'm sure that this coalition could work." Andreotti answered. The two gentlemen engaging in a civilized discussion was a breath of fresh air for Almirante compared to the loud madness from a couple of days ago. "However, the final decision is up to our leader. He'll decide if we move forward with this" De Marsanich said looking at Almirante with a smile. Almirante knew that De Marsanich was probably just licking his boots because he favored the moderates, but for once it felt good that his party recognized his rule. Sidelining those reckless extremists was a very good idea in hindsight. The Prime Minister cleared his throat and he prepared for an answer."

Before he could change the channel, Almirante started to speak. "I'm familiarized with the suffering of the Italian people. These last years have been rough for so many hard workers in this nation."  After having his salary reduced in half, the prospect of losing his job worried Marco inmensily. Maybe this guy knows what he is talking about? \n\n"But from now on, things will start to improve.

Upon knowing that the BN was planning to compromise with more moderate parties, Rauti furiously complained that the party was selling out to the Democrats and demanded an "immediate change of course". Since they ignored his demands, he tore apart his membership card and announced his resignation from his position at the party.The Duce would be so ashamed to see his beloved party capitulate to the whims of the liberals. Walking on the streets, he reflected on how fascism has reached this low point.The answer was obvious: greed and arrogance corrupted the fascist movement and someone needed to purify it from the leeches that want to undermine the cause. "I'll protect the future of fascism no matter the cost and with any means necessary. Even if I have to destroy the country itself." Rauti thought to himself. A malicious grin appeared on his face.

As he remained unable to change anything, Umberto asked to himself: what he should do next? Look the other way as his country falls to authoritarianism again? That seemed like the only thing he could do for now, but he is not going to be that easily manipulated. "I need to figure out how to limit his power, but how?" Umberto thought shaking the wine glass. "Maybe a small vacation in the Alps could refresh my mind."

And they're absolutely right: I don't have any respect for anyone here except the proud fascists that want to defend the nation." As Almirante stopped to drink some water, murmurs of concern could be heard across the seats. Almirante was finally showing his true face. "The Italians don't need a bunch of useless idiots that they don't even represent them. They need a strong man to get things done quickly and efficiently." The room filled with screams of disapproval mixed with the roars of approval of the fascist parliamentarians. "The people has spoken at the ballot. They elected me to put this country back to his feet. Why I need to fold to a bunch of incompetent idiots unable to win an election to tell me what to do? Do you think I care what you have to say?" n\nThe Democrats booed him loudly, with some Socialists insulting him. One of them even threw a pen at him angrily. Almirante ignored them, and kept going. "This entire Parliament is useless. It's nothing but a waste of money to maintain a group of treacherous communist parasites. I'll end this farce once for all and put the real patriots back in charge. I represent the will of the people so now you have to obey me." The outrage consumed the opposition block as members of the Blocchi Nazionale clapped with enthusiasm. The Prime Minister left the room satisfied. Things were going to change around here."

In fact, he was looking forward to it. But he still had a feeling of uncertainty: does Almirante has the guts to stand up to the government? A dog that only barks and don't bite is nothing but a coward. The Decima MAS didn't got their reputation by just yelling on how they were going to blow enemy ships.n\nAn agitated Navy junior officer entered his office with a paper on his hand. "Sir, this telegram just came for you." Borghese read the message surprised. "Democratic experiment must end. Possible confrontation with the enemies of fascism. Logistical and military support needed if fight escalates." Borghese chuckled at the request. It was obvious that Almirante was actually planning to use full force to bent the government to his will. Maybe he wasn't just a barking dog after all! "It looks like the Prime Minister wants to become the new Duce. And he actually needs my help to do so." he expressed jovially.

As he was preparing to leave his small cabin outside the capital, he tumbled with an old photograph of his family: his wife, son, daughter-in-law and his grandchildren all posing happily on the beach. Tears started to come down his cheeks. How did his family end like this? His beloved Stella left him ten years ago, after losing her fight with breast cancer. His son gave his life in the desert to keep up the fire of fascism alive in the Middle East. And how his grandchildren thanked his great service to the proud Italian nation? The male one became a lawyer, defending the rights of the deviants and communists that are threatening the fabric of society with their subversive actions. The younger female one became an actress, working at the den of degeneracy that is the cinema industry. And their neglecting mother does nothing but enable their corruption, so it was no surprise to him that they became like that even with the best fascist education.  As far as he could tell, the three were dead to him. All these years, he felt like he was truly alone in this world. But there was a time when he was truly happy. \n\n After returning from the First War bitter and resentful, he joined the Blackshirts with the hope that he could make a difference in saving his beloved Italy. That fateful day of October, he marched in Rome with his fellow Blackshirts to demand the King to end the weak democratic government and put a true patriot in power. With the appointment of Mussolini as Prime Minister, he felt like he was part of something bigger. It was the happiest day of his life and he loyally served the Duce for the next thirty years. Full of confidence, he was ready to save Italy from the abyss that was in it because of the traitor Ciano. Democracy won't corrupt the minds and souls of the children ever again. Italy will rise from the ashes with another march on Rome! With a smile on his face, Pietro closed the door to make history once again."

All were ready to execute the plan: storm the Quirinale and force the King to declare the state of emergency and suspend parliament. "Are you all ready to make Mussolini proud?" he said, raising his arm in salute, and all nodded. The group followed the slight slope of the hill, a light, continuous noise in the distance further masking their movements, until they reached the Palace's entrance, guarded by two Fanti dell'Aria of the Honour Guard: with a silent signal, one of the fascists, a decorated veteran of the Russian campaign, knocked one unconscious, while another put a hand on the second one's mouth to silence him. The light noise became more pronounced.\n\nWhile the Blackshirts bound and gagged the two men, the rest surrounded the gates. Almirante made to speak, but suddenly the noise became deafening. A helicopter appeared, bathing the square in artificial light, and dozens of windows opened to reveal the snipers lurking behind. One of the fascists tried to fire, but screamed in pain as he was hit to the shoulder. All others surrendered immediately.\n\nAn officer in high uniform came out of the Quirinale and went to the now-handcuffed Almirante. "Prime Minister, in light of your treason, His Majesty relieves you from your office" he said for everyone to hear. Then, he whispered into his ear: "You are a small man, with an even smaller intellect. You might have spent months preparing this little charade, but the King has spent preparing for the return of democracy, and he will suffer no interlopers" Almirante looked up, and saw a familiar face looking at him from a protected window. "DAMN YOU!" he screamed at the King, but Umberto didn't react. Then, the officer spoke to one of the soldiers: "Bring him away, perhaps he will enjoy confinement in Ventotene. By the King's order, activate Piano Solo" The soldier saluted: "Yes, commander!" and led the traitor away."

They had barely reached the gates, when their leader, a young man who had impressed Almirante for his strong faith in fascism, felt something was off as he saw the entrance unguarded, and then he noticed something round and small rolling towards him. "STUN GRENADE!" he screamed to his men, but he had no time to react before it exploded, filling his eyes with white, and deafening him. He stumbled blindly, barely taking notice of the arms throwing him to the ground, but he definitely felt the handcuffs cutting into his wrists, and the shame coming with it.\n\nThe other teams met a similar end: the Fourth Blackshirts "Amba Alagi" couldn't even reach the Prefecture before they were seized by more than a hundred Carabinieri, the Sixth Blackshirts "Eroi di Legnano" took heavy losses when they tried to fight their way out from being encircled near the parliament, and the Eighth Blackshirts "Duce" suffered the same fate when they underestimated the enemy forces defending the armoury of the Polizia Municipale. All across Rome, gunshots could be heard, and the people ran to the windows, only to see dozens of police vans unloading hundreds of Carabinieri, and replacing their cargo with men in black shirts and camo uniforms, some limping, others holding their injuries, but every one of them shared the same expression: shame.

They had been so close: when the fascist supporters had attacked Forte Braschi, one of the fifteen old brick forts protecting Rome, they had merely wanted to storm a lightly guarded armoury. How could they suspect that, under the façade of an obsolete fort, was a maze of heavily protected bunkers housing the HQ of the Servizio Informazione Militare? The fools didn't even have the time to load their guns...\n\nWhen he returned to the command room more than twenty meters under the ground, an aide took him from his reflections: "General! A dispatch from our field operatives!" and gave De Lorenzo a short telegram. "King secured. Activation order given. Government buildings stormed. Parliament secured. Traitors arrested. Some fled. Non-hostile personnel spared. Unnecessary losses avoided. Requesting further orders." The general knew this was the moment he had been preparing for. He went to a secluded archive, one where none had set foot for at least five years if the dust was true: there, he looked for a folder he had personally sealed more than a decade ago, on the orders of the last Duce of Fascism. His hand brushed the rough cardboard files, reading names he would have gladly forgotten, until he found what he wanted: the letters were a bit faded, but still clear in their simple, rough characters. Such a boring name for something so important: "PIANO SOLO", because when De Lorenzo had asked Ciano who should have participated, he had answered "Solo i Carabinieri". He broke the frail seal and took the first, yellowed paper sheet, titled "Azioni indifferibili per la sicurezza dello Stato", and returned to the command room. All noise stopped, everyone looking at him. "All men! Commence execution of Piano Solo!" and noise filled the room once again."

 #Fanfani
 christdem.51.t:0 "The Shadow of the Sun"
 christdem.51.d:0 "According to the press and television, the person guilty of the Piazza Fontana bombing has already been found: Pietro Valpreda, a known anarchist, was spotted entering the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura building with a large suitcase some time before the explosion. If one were to watch any Italian news broadcast, it would seem like this is an open-and-shut case - Valpreda has a flimsy alibi, a clear motive, and a connection to the crime scene. While many voices of varying levels of influence have criticized the narrative, pointing out its inconsistencies, most of the public, the journalists and the politicians all feel reassured to know that the horror can be easily explained away by pointing at a gang of radical anarchist fanatics - something which Amintore Fanfani is very happy to do, especially during his numerous appearances on national television.\n\nThe reports appearing on the desk of prime minister Fanfani tell a different story. After looking at some particular elements of the case, namely the bags used to carry the explosives and the timers which set them off, police and Carabinieri report point out to the possibility that the terrorist act was, in fact, not orchestrated by the Milanese anarchists. Some photographs, documents and recordings lend credibility to the fact that anarchist cells, dormant in Milan for a long time, have been infiltrated by extremist right wing and neo-fascist groups, with a sort of mesh of personal relationships and political contacts between these anarchist groups and several fascist militants being documented. A hypothesis even emerged that the attack was in fact not carried out by Valpreda, but by another person connected to underground fascist groups carefully disguised to look like Valpreda.\n\nHowever, this is not all. Through Aldo Moro and his extensive contacts in SIM, some top secret documents have reached Fanfani regarding the high possibility of foreign interference in the bombing. Some of the anarchist and fascist militants who were about to be further investigated by local police seem to have vanished into thin air, and some reference to what appear to be codenames for what might very well be foreign operatives pop up in the material that the police amassed. All the officers involved in gathering and analyzing these elements seem to have forbidden themselves from formulating theories regarding where this foreign influence could come from, almost as if they were in fear of the possible implications."

 christdem.52.d:0 "The Prime Minister stepped into the hotel ballroom surrounded by his usual entourage of aides, secretaries, and supporters. The many wings of the party looked back at him, their faces calm but their eyes betraying the uncertain hope they held in him to guide Italy through turbulent times. The political left could offer words of support where they agreed, and plenty of condemnation when they didn't. The political right sent him the nicest letters, when they could be stirred to bother sending them. Such was the price of attempting to chart a center course. \n\nIt had taken nearly five minutes to calm the assembled delegates before he was finally allowed to speak. His prepared speech lay written in cards in his suit pocket, but with the worried glances being shot into him from all sides of the room, it was quite obvious that taking it out would only further fracture the party. With a forced smile and a wiping of his brow, he attempted to speak on how the party could bridge the growing divide both within Italy and indeed within itself. \n\n"Compromise," he began, "Compromise had led to the end of fascism, to the end of political tyranny and uncertainty within Italy. The voters selected me for this office not because of radical ideas and bomb throwing populism, but because all Italians knew that whether they agreed with us or not, the Democrazia Cristiana offered practical, functioning solutions." He wiped his brow again and gave another forced smile. Some delegates even returned it. For the next thirty minutes he continued to offer his hopes for the future of Italy and its democracy, his hopes for party unity and confidence, and his hopes for an end to uncertainty and panic. Perhaps the delegates did not truly believe him, but as long as they could say that they did, it was good enough."

 christdem.53.d:0 "The reporter in the back, a fresh faced journalist sent to observe the series of speeches being done by the Prime Minister and his aides across Southern Italy, raised up his instant camera and snapped a photo. The camera flash echoed across the room, immortalizing the Prime Minister and the politician beside him within the finite medium of film. \n\nOn the left side of the photo stood the Prime Minister, dressed in a fine suit and tie, extending his hand out towards a local member of the Democrazia Cristiana. On the right side of the photo stood that local member, a former farmer and always pious catholic turned local politician for the city of Salerno. Captured in the back of the photo, behind Fanfani and the local politician was the Prime Minister's entourage, a motley assortment of baby faced university graduates turned interns, grizzled party operators, and trusted aides. If one could look close enough, they could see the relief in their eyes at another successful meeting. Few had suspected Fanfani's move to reconcile the Party's left and right would succeed, but all within the party would be glad that it had. \n\nGlancing at the photo, the reporter scowled when he saw that the lighting was off.

A literal wall of televisions was presented, dozens of different models from not only Italy, but America and Japan as well. Despite the disparity, one thing was consistent. On each of the screens, a recording of the Prime Minister's speech from last night began playing. \n\nA podium stands empty, a member of the Carabinieri stands to the left of it and a member of the Polizia to its right. The Prime Minister walks into frame from the right, the two members begin clapping as he does so, he waves to the camera. The teleprompter screen is briefly visible in the reflection of his glasses. He stands on the stage and smiles, the lighting and editing effects ensure that he appears more photogenic than usual. "Good evening to the viewers both in the studio and at home, I am thankful that across our humble nation the vast majority of not only Democrazia Cristiana voters, but in fact all voters are watching." he begins, still maintaining his composure, "It is undeniable that times have been better, and some have even begun to question the very founding principles of our democracy. To these rioters and criminals within our streets, I can only offer my most sincere condemnation. If you truly wish for change then you can institute it like a normal, civilized member of the population and not as a bomb throwing barbarian. My government has embraced a wide ranging platform of simple, commonsense solutions to the crisis at hand and I will, if you give me just an hour of your time, explain them to y-" \n\nThe speech cuts out suddenly, as the store owner changes the TV's channels to last night's football game.

 christdem.55.d:0 "Despite all of the turbulence and upheaval within Italy, it was undeniable that many things remained consistent. The Catholic Church and its Pope, Paul VI, for example, had been more than willing to meet with the Prime Minister when asked. It didn't take a genius to figure out why. Fanfani could ask the Pope for stability and peace within these troubled times to shore up his government, and the Pope could use the photo opportunity to stress the unity of being both Italian and Catholic, two ideas that had once seemed almost irreconcilable. \n\nThe meeting itself was, to put it bluntly, almost benign in its content, both men clearly occupied elsewhere. The Pope would ask for guarantees of the government to maintain peace and ensure religious freedom, and the Prime Minister would agree. The Prime Minister would ask the Pope to make sure his flock would remain peaceful and equitable even in the face of violence within the streets, and the Pope would of course agree. At the end of the meeting came the most important part, where the two emerged from Saint Peter's Basilica and embraced. \n\nTomorrow, a photo of that embrace would be on the front page of every newspaper in Italy, and accompanying it would be the newest editorial from the Pope, requesting peace not just for the sake of the government, but for the sake of humanity everywhere."

 christdem.56.t:0 "Building a New Coalition"
 christdem.56.d:0 "It had taken every year of political experience and grit that Fanfani had to accept the reality that no matter how many flowery speeches and calls for unity he gave, the simple reality was that the Democrazia Cristiana would not unite around him. The Party Right was too apathetic, and the Party Left too divided to ever build the coalition that Italy needed if it was to push forward through such troubled times. With a heavy heart, he had picked up the heavy phone on his desk and placed a call to an unlikely ally. Giuseppe Saragat, leader of the Partito Socialdemocratico Italiano. \n\nAs the two men sat together in the Prime Minister's office, a strange and awkward silence stood between them. In better times it would have been easy for them to talk the night away on topics of policy and politics, but the reality was that Fanfani was the Prime Minister, and the other was only an embattled party leader. \n\nWith some difficulty, the silence was eventually broken, and they began discussing how a middle ground could be formed. Saragat made sure to not let his surprise at the news of Fanfani's decision to move away from his own party show on his face, and Fanfani maintained his composure even during the diciest moment of their negotiations. In the end, a compromise was reached. \n\nThe foundations for Fanfani's most ambitious political gambit were laid."

 christdem.57.d:0 "He sat at his desk, his brow creased as he continued to crunch the numbers of support for the coalition he had been building. To say that the Democrazia Cristiana had been critical of the decision would be... an understatement. The press had been vicious, the voters savage, and his own former allies within the party the most critical of all. It didn't take much to imagine how they would react once tomorrow's paper broke the news of his recent meeting with the king. \n\nMeeting with the king under normal circumstances would have, at best, raised one or two eyebrows from the most radical members of the political spectrum. For years his Majesty had conducted himself with an aura of dignity, one that could only be formed through years of dedicated public service. Under normal circumstances, Fanfani would have had nothing to worry about when meeting his majesty. \n\nIt was a shame that these were not normal circumstances. \n\nHis intentions when meeting with his majesty, especially in light of the meeting with Saragat, were obvious. The BN, no matter how their ideas dispersed, could all still reliantly maintain their faith and support for the monarchy. Attempting to pander to them was a dangerous proposition for the Prime Minister, but one that had to be done. He had no idea how his legacy would look, how his supporters would react, and how his own party would fare at the next election. Whatever happened, it did not matter, for with a triumphant shout, he finally finished crunching the numbers. If everything panned out as it should, he would have his majority."

 christdem.58.d:0 ""Prosperity and peace through compromise, labour leaders and the Prime Minister agree this is the best way forward. Don't take our word for it, listen to from the horse's mouth!" \n\nThe campaign truck slowly drove down the road past the assembled workers, each side of it covered with campaign slogans and posters praising the Prime Minister. Through the speaker system placed on top of it, excerpts of a recent speech were played one after another, with Fanfani's words mixed in with the words of various prominent union officials. For the assembled factory workers, the campaign truck was either an interesting afternoon diversion or an annoyance distracting them from their food, depending on who you asked. \n\nTwo workers in particular, brothers from a small town outside of Naples, listened intently to the truck, even as it pulled away to drive to another factory. Turning to one another, the oldest spoke first, commenting on how glad he was to see the union bosses and the Prime Minister collaborating. A patriotic military veteran who served with distinction in the Levant, he stood as a polar opposite to his left minded younger brother. His younger brother folded his arms across his chest and listened intently, considering what to say. When at last he finally spoke, it was to the surprise of his older brother. \n\n"Despite what misgivings I have," he began, "I must say it is good to see the Prime Minister refusing to blame the violence on the unions. It would be terrible to have the actions of a few bomb throwing radicals put us all out of a job." As he finished speaking, the factory bell rang signaling the end of their lunch break. Picking up their belongings, the brothers returned to work."

 christdem.59.t:0 "The Issue of Efficiency"
 christdem.59.d:0 "The report on the Prime Minister's desk had been disturbing but expected. Following an intense period of review and investigation by a specially appointed commission, the reported findings had long been suspected but not confirmed. Until now. The Confindustria, an employers association and long a pillar of the Italian economy, was hopelessly inefficient as currently run. \n\nPerhaps worst of all, no obvious easy solution presented itself for remedying this issue. Within the report, the commission had offered two possible solutions, each one equally flawed in its own right. The first solution, written by the commission's more left leaning members and idealists, proposed to simply place greater government controls and regulations on the body, in order to ensure greater efficiency. Without a doubt the leaders of the Confindustria would fight such regulations as hard as they could, and it was questionable whether allowing the same corrupt bureaucrats to continue to run the organization would fix anything at all. The other option, written by pragmatists and the commission's old guard, proposed a simple fix. The Confindustria had been fine up until the democratization, they argued, all it would need to get back on its feet was the return of its old runners who knew the ins and outs of the economy. The only problem: that same old guard had been removed for being fascists without remorse. It is certainly doubtful that the population would simply accept such individuals regaining their old power. \n\nAs appalling as the options presented are, a choice must be made. We can only hope that we make the correct one."

 christdem.60.d:0 "For the priests and clergy who served in the Milan Cathedral during the era known as the Cold War, they would forever carry one memory with them. \n\nIt had begun mere hours after the first news came out about the Piazza Fontana bombing. A man dressed in a formerly fine suit, one now caked with dust, debris, and other bits of clutter stumbled into the Church. The clergy looked on with grave concern as he entered, unsure if the man should be in the church or in the hospital. To those present's imminent surprise, the man did not move to pray. Instead, he took the hat off his head and placed it in the center of the Church's foyer, and next to it he placed a simple picture of one of the victims. Out of respect, the clergy placed several candles to mark the spot and assumed nothing more would come of it. \n\nOver the next couple months they would be proven dead wrong. \n\nAt first they came as a trickle. Survivors,  family, friends, and anyone else involved. With each visit, the shrine slowly grew. Soon it turned to a flood, as many who had no connection to the tragedy other than a shared sense of hopelessness came and added to the shrine. It grew steadily, soon attracting the intention of not only the press, but even the prime minister himself. In a photograph shown across the world, Prime Minister Fanfani visited the shrine, personally lowering his head in solidarity with those lost. \n\nWhile the shrine eventually was taken down and cleaned up, and for some, even forgotten, the clergy present would never forget it. Decades after the bombing and its aftermath, not a single member of the clergy had even once thought about throwing away the photo taken of them with the Prime Minister."

"Now I am sure many of you are less than pleased to have me interrupt your football game or television drama, but if you'll just lend me a minute of your time, I'm sure you will find it worthwhile. There has been much uncertainty and fear recently over the growing terrorist attacks and violence within our nation's streets. I am here to assure you that the government is doing everything possible to protect our citizens and find the cause of this rampant lawlessness. \n\nThe image changes, and now several clips begin playing in succession of one another. The Polizia are seen on patrol, each one dressed in an impressive uniform and brandishing a rifle. Next an Italian family is shown enjoying a midday meal outside, the children smile and play as the parents look at eachother free of worry. Finally, several successive scenes are shown of various investigators and detectives working, each one carefully and analytically completing their investigation. \n\nThe scene changes back to the Prime Minister who is now smiling at the camera. "As you can see, the government has everything under control. I can promise that we have already begun to get to the bottom of this and it will not be long before we return to normalcy." The screen freezes on his smile, and a small signature appears on the bottom left corner of the screen."

If the reporters could have seen their thoughts, perhaps tomorrow's paper would have been quite different. \n\n"No matter how I think about it, I can't help feeling just a little disgust with that man to the right of the Prime Minister. Isn't he a friend of the last Duce, Galeazzo Ciano? Surely such a man's hands can not be completely clean in this whole ordeal, I wish Fanfani would stop associating with him." Saragat thought to himself. \n\n"This entire gesture is ridiculous, we're campaigning for unity when we should be crushing those protesting reds in our streets. If only I had won the last election... I'm sure Saragat must be thinking the same thing." Thought Lauro to himself. \n\n"At least they were both willing to do this. I can only hope the political blowback from the rest of the party won't be too severe... oh, the press wants a photo."

The many banks that compromised Italy's financial sector had, no matter how many promises of potential benefits and concessions offered by the government, stringently refused to work with the Prime Minister's platform of catholic capitalism on his terms. Rather, they continued to demand the right that if they were to work on it with him, it would have to be on their terms. \n\nAs the Prime Minister sat at his desk after another day of fruitless negotiations, his gaze fell on the calendar on his desk. He had known the date when he had woken up that morning. He had known the date when he had gotten lunch with his aides before the next round of negotiations with the Banks. Only now, at the midnight hour, did he truly recognize the significance of the date. \n\nHis term, one which had opened with promises of stability and prosperity and had stuck through thick and thin, was slowly nearing a close. The fight with the banks was clearly not going anywhere fast, not with the next round of lawsuits and ad campaigns they had threatened to kick up. And all the while he was losing what hair he had left dealing with this, many more important issues lay on the back burner. He had never been one to back down from a fight, but surely now was as good a time as any. As he finally broke his gaze with the calendar, he knew what to do."

It is unmistakable that because of his work, many of tomorrow's greatest thinkers, scientists, and military men will be able to look back at the former Prime Minister and thank him for his work. Expanding on such programs is not only a good way to build Italy's future today, but it is also a good way to boost Fanfani's stagnate approval numbers. \n\nWith every bill passed increasing funding for these widely popular programs, Fanfani has ensured that he will be the face of it. At the opening of new school's he will cut the ribbon, at the graduation of new university students he will clap in attendance, and at military parades for new cadets he will be there to salute the soldiers. It is important that every person who has benefited from the program will know firmly that it was the Democrazia Cristiana who made it all possible. \n\nWhile some may look at this with the disgust of a cynic, the people will know in their hearts that it is for the best.

At a podium in the center of the stage, a professor carefully vetted by the man's aides gave a gripping speech to the students in attendance. He spoke of the virtues of moderation and Catholic modesty in the face of soulless communist materialism and hateful fascist nationalism, every syllable going over the head of the thoroughly bored student body. In the back, reporters gathered to snap a photo of the moment of the Prime Minister cutting the oversized ribbon and bow placed before him, a symbolic ceremony to celebrate the opening of the campus's newest building. \n\nFar in the corner of the assembled students, under the cover of an old tree, two of the school's more left leaning students sat observing the spectacle. They joked together and mocked the speech being given, each one equal parts amused and agitated by the professor's dry speech on the evil's of an ideology he clearly knew little about. For them, it was all in all a pleasant enough way to spend half an hour. \n\nEventually the professor stepped down from his podium and the band present struck up the national anthem. With a broad smile, the prime minister received an oversized pair of scissors and moved forward to cut the oversized ribbon. As it split in two, the stage was covered by an outburst of camera flashes as the reporters finally had their shot. When it was all over and done, the two student's before remained seated under the tree. To the annoyance of one, his comrade in mockery had remained completely silent through the entire ribbon cutting. \n\nIt took some pressing, but eventually the man gave his answer in a low voice, not even daring to meet his friend's gaze. "I... I was already to mock it as well, but then I thought about my younger cousin. They don't have enough money to go to university on their own, not without the help of the government.

"I'm glad you agreed to meet me for lunch Arnold, you've certainly made an impression with the rest of the party. When you speak of my ideas to them, they all swear that it is like they are hearing them from myself for the first time. You certainly have a bright future ahead of yourself in this party, perhaps when my term ends it will be you who ends up taking my spot as PM." \n\nForlani smiled and looked down at his food, the Prime Minister's words echoing around his head. He had long been swayed by the man's ideas of Catholic capitalism and Christian democracy, without a doubt, and hearing such praise from the man himself was a dream come true... but... \n\nHe had the strangest feeling in the back of his mind, a sort of unease that refused to present itself into view. A most cowardly, traitorous thought ruining an otherwise perfect afternoon. As he looked back up from his meal, he looked over the Prime Minister's face, daring the thought to present itself.

As if it were a mantra, meant to keep Saragat sane in the face of a monumental task ahead.\n\nTo say that Italy was going through a rough time at the moment would be the understatement of the year. Ever since the Hot Autumn strikes a year earlier, Italy had been embroiled in the worst turmoil it had seen since the end of the war. Violence and terrorism were the order of the day, from both leftist and rightist agitators across the country.\n\nRestoring order to a deeply divided nation seemed like an Herculean, if not insurmountable task.\n\nBut whilst Saragat seemed like a meek, soft-spoken man, there was a hidden resolve beneath his spectacles. Now was his time. Time to not only restore order and heal the rifts of a deeply divided nation, but also to, as a result, create a fairer, more just Italy. An Italy for every Italian.\n\nBut first, the hard work..."

Claiming 17 lives and wounding many more, it was perhaps the deadliest incident yet in the troubled country.\n\nAnd yet, the perpetrators are still unknown, and thus, still at large.\n\nNot helping matters was the fact that many in the Servizio Informazioni Militare (SIM) are believed to be full of agents opposed to the FD's socialist agenda.\n\nThus, a reshuffle was in order. The government could not get to the bottom of the atrocity without the SIM's cooperation, after all.\n\nMany from both politicians and the general public criticized the government's decision to reshuffle the SIM. Some said the government was trying to stack the deck in their favor. Right-wingers and the BN in particular claimed that the government was 'politicising the SIM', and that it would abuse it in order to persecute them and their supporters.\n\nIt certainly was not a good look for the government, with newspapers and broadcasts across the country condemning it.

But it was clear that Saragat's olive branch to DC was not without fruit. Both in public and in private, Armintore Fanfani made it clear that the FD and DC had broadly similar goals for the situation: to stabilize Italy and safeguard Italy's fledgling democracy from those who would do it harm.\n\nWhilst many of the more radical elements of the FD grumbled at the fact that Saragat was open to working with DC, at the end of the day, it was necessary to put country over party.

In other words, a far cry from the mild-mannered, down to earth Saragat. One would think that the two would have clashing personalities, and that they would be like oil and water.\n\nAnd yet, that was not the case.\n\nFanfani, whilst a firebrand, was also a great compromiser, just like Saragat. It stood to reason, after all, considering DC was a big-tent party with many factions. But meeting with him one-on-one, Saragat soon realized that the two men actually had quite a bit in common despite their differing personalities.\n\nThe meeting of the two men lasted quite some time. But by the time both left the room, both had smiles on their faces. Perhaps it was because they were able to get a lot of business done, or perhaps the two men just enjoyed each other's company.

Many moderates were already skeptical of socialism; needless to say, they balked at the radicalism of the Italian Communist Party. However, they formed an essential part of the FD coalition, so Saragat would have no choice but to meet with the leader of the PCI: Enrico Berlinguer.\n\nBerlinguer was certainly an interesting character. In some ways, he was a modest man quite similar to Saragat himself. That said, the man certainly was not wanting for charisma. He was a heartthrob for leftists across Italy, even those who weren't necessarily fans of the communists he was associated with. Perhaps it was because he gave off the aura of an honest, genuine man, who wanted to make life better for Italians. None could ever doubt the sincerity of his intentions on that front.\n\nWhilst Saragat would never be able to claim Berlinguer was a bad person with a straight face, he nevertheless needed him on board during these trying times. The problem was that Berlinguer is a very outspoken man, and he has had some biting criticism of Saragat's government, and its 'inaction' on the issues ravaging Italy.\n\nNevertheless, he was an integral part of the FD coalition.

As has been the case with leftist coalitions throughout history, division was often rife despite their nominally similar ideologies, to the point that sometimes their coalition seemed more fiction than fact.\n\nIf Italy were to have any confidence in the government to be strong and stable, it would need to have confidence in the party running said government to do the same.\n\nTo that end, a meeting was organized between the socialists and the communists in the FD in order to showcase unity within the FD and the wider left. Attended by notables from all the parties of the FD, the rally made it clear that, whatever divisions there may seem to be, FD was a united front. At least, on the issues that mattered.\n\nThe rally was a roaring success! It was widely reported throughout the Italian media.

Whilst they contest elections as a united front, they were still, at the end of the day, separate parties working to a common goal.\n\nNo longer.\n\nThe Fronte Democratico has been reborn. As one party, and only one party. The PSI and the PCI, along with their many allies, no longer exist; its members, and elected officials, are now simply members of the Fronte Democratico. No ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nSome people from across the FD's various factions were not happy with this development. But the leaders of the FD argued its necessity. Both for making it easier to contest elections, as well as showing to the Italian people that the era of the fractious left was over. Italy needed unity now more than ever.

And drag through the mud the media did. It seemed like the FD could do nothing at all without being raked over the coals by the media.\n\nBut that did not perturb Saragat and the FD. They would not let broadcasters with chips on their shoulders dissuade them from doing what was right. For the party, and for the country. Even though the media seemed to be hellbent on slandering the government and tearing it down, there was no choice but to press on, no matter the cost.\n\nFailure was simply not an option."

To some, it's associated with fundamentalism and traditionalism.\n\nNot so for Saragat and the FD. Of course, they obviously supported 'family values'. But to them, it meant more "taking care of the family" than about traditionalism or morality.\n\n"Excellent healthcare for every Italian! Generous pensions for elderly Italians in their golden years! A thorough education for young Italians so that they may become productive members of society!"\n\nThese points underscored the FD's messaging  on 'family values'. Every Italian family deserved a fair shot at life. From birth until their twilight years, no Italian family deserved anything less than the best."

 saragat.12.d:0 "The relationship between Saragat and PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer was not always good. But that, perhaps, was due to change.\n\nWith the merger of the FD into a single party, it was more important than ever to show that its leaders were a united front, to both FD members and the Italian public at large. It was for this reason that Berlinguer and Saragat increasingly began to voice their support for each other and increased their cooperation. After all, no progress could be made for Italy when the government could not agree with itself.\n\nSome of the moderates in the party were wary of working with a noted communist like Berlignuer, but they ultimately kept those doubts to themselves. The leftists in the party, of course, were nothing less than thrilled at this turn of events."

 marsanich.2.t:0 "The New Strategy"
 marsanich.2.d:0 "A bloody disgrace, a horrible shame, an inhuman tragedy - these and other such expressions did Achille Lauro, new Italian prime minister, use to refer to the recent Piazza Fontana attack. And yet, when asked what the government was planning to do regarding the attack, prime minister Lauro's responds with words that are much more vague. Following the official police reports, the prime minister was happy to point at gangs of fanatics from extremist, most likely anarchist and perhaps communist, cells from Milan and the hinterland - and apart from invoking greater executive prerogatives and giving emergency powers to the police to deal with the matter as they see fit, Lauro hasn't exactly done much to address the bombing, at least publically.\n\nIn truth, Lauro does have a very clear plan in mind. To Lauro, the questions of who placed the bomb in Piazza Fontana and why simply don't matter. Was it anarchists, fascists, communists, foreign spies, Italian agents? Nobody knows, and nobody will probably ever be able to know. Whoever did it was most likely smart and powerful enough to hide his traces and cover up everything long before whoever's in charge of investigations will manage to get even close to the truth. What truly matters is how the bombing can be used. The people of Italy live in fear - a bomb, a bullet, a knife might reach anybody, anywhere - a crazed radical with bloodshot eyes and a red or black scarf might jump out of the shadows at a moment's notice - no train, tram or building is safe.\n\nIn such a climate, what the people need it to feel reassured. They need to hear the calm, strong hand of the state on their shoulders. Restrictive and authoritarian laws are welcomed by the majority, and the minority that protests is decried as an unwilling, or perhaps even willing, ally of the terrorists. In such a climate, governing a nation is easy - you simply need to tell them what they want to hear. Lauro realized this very well, and as the orders to give extraordinary powers to local police commissars are already being sent out, he knows that this is only the first step. Using tension as a weapon, Lauro and his allies plan to shape Italy into the mold they designed - a strong, moral and noble Italy, its children devoted to the King and to the Fatherland, and governed by the steady and firm hand of Achille Lauro."

 marsanich.3.d:0 "Many strings had to be pulled and many alliances had to be signed to get where Lauro is now. Deal bargaining, concessions and doing what had to be done has given him what he needed. But, has it given him exactly what he did not. The BN's friends, affiliates, are not viewed as well as the BN is itself, suffice to say. It must be stated these people are but extremely patriotic friends of the state, nothing more.\n\nThrough a wide array of phone calls, letters, and backroom deals the press started printing just what Lauro wanted. People that were once "monstrous extremists, brutish grunts" were now "valiant citizens, patriotic sons of Italy." What more could Lauro ask for? It seemed that to get what you wanted, all you had to do was nudge things in place."

 marsanich.4.d:0 "Lauro had a lot on his plate today, like he did every other day, but the next few decisions were going to be very important. And now, he was being driven to an undisclosed location in downtown Rome, surrounded by two men who had been his rivals in months past. Amintore Fanfani and Arnaldo Fortani, the kingpins of the Democrazia Christiana. The three of them were some of the most powerful men in Italy, and they were going out for brunch. Eventually, they parked outside of some quaint cafe amid one of the busiest areas of the city. As they sat down to eat, they realized they hadn't actually any idea what to talk about. So, they turned to the absolute centrepiece of any conversation, sports! It turned out that Amintore was a fan of soccer too, and watched the same teams Lauro did.\n\nOver the course of the meal, the tensions surrounding them melted away, and they were well into conversation after the eating was done. Political discourse, small talk and of course the odd joke about their own parties made the hour. It seemed that Amintore was a nice guy, and Arnaldo was interesting, as quiet as he was. Lauro had finally enjoyed his job for once, and got some erstwhile friends out of it too. He chuckled to himself, what else to mend political rifts than mediocre food and slightly better talk?"

The Fronte Democratico, a primary rival of the Blocchi Nazionali, has come under soft pressure. Many in the BN have taken it upon themselves to criticize those that have not called out the perpetrators, especially socialist groups. Despite the fact no clear evidence even proving the bombers are socialists, this has made a convenient route to demonize socialist groups that could serve as threats to the BN's rule.\n\nThe FD itself is included within this ring of parties, but no outright statements have been made against it, for fear of the press picking up on it and spreading the BN's blatant usage of the situation to further their own agenda. They may eventually concede, but for now, Lauro laughs knowing his rival bleeds."

 marsanich.6.d:0 "In recent times, the more moderate parts of the Blocchi Nazionali have taken up the reigns and are driving the party and Italy as a whole on a path many other parts of it consider too devious from original party lines. With Giorgo Almirante taking a seat back from politics, he has effectively signed over control to Lauro and the moderates. Those original followers of Almirante and even Scorza have been taken aback to these actions and now some even leave the party. Public demonstrations, letters of resignation and complaints all show clearly the frustration present in the party. Despite all their crying and shouting, Lauro likely couldn't care less. In his mind, the more his section dominates, the better. He is even now purposely pushing these members to leave, and outright removing others. Regardless of how detrimental to short-term stability it may be, it will run out smooth, just like the plan says."

 marsanich.7.t:0 "Completely Normal Lauro"
 marsanich.7.d:0 "As Lauro was walking onto the stage, he contemplated exactly what to say, what to do and how to act. Why was he doing this? People didn't trust him. Why didn't people trust him? His past. Or, at least, that was the story he wanted to present. Why people didn't like him wasn't a concern, only how he can change their minds. After some excruciatingly long strides, he reached the podium. Looking out across the sea of reporters, a barrage of lights assaulted his eyes. The press was always eager to take pictures. He looked away quickly, lest he go blind. Shuffling his neat collection of papers, he laid them out across the thick mahogany stand. The bleaching white lights that operated above him illuminated only his position in the large dark room. Unlucky, he thought, because he must've appeared quite nervous. Adjusting his collar and clearing his throat, he began.\n\n"...and that, the fair people of Italy, is why you must trust me! For the good of this nation and for the good of its citizens, I am the one who will lead you. My associates, and my own past, must be put aside. I am another son of Italy, as all of you are, and I share your struggles. That is why I must appeal to you for your trust so that our great nation may prosper."\n\nWith those closing remarks, his speech was done. Almost immediately, a wave of questions knocked aside the quietness of the room, asking him to respond to this accusation or that one, some scandal he must solve. He didn't have time for it. Rushing off the stage, his plea would be spread across the empire. For better or worse, Lauro cannot be viewed as an extremist, only as a friend of the people."

 marsanich.8.t:0 "A Most Royal Meeting"
 marsanich.8.d:0 "Another day, another meeting. Lauro had met so many faces, and shook so many hands at this point that it all started to blend. But today, this one was special. This time he would be meeting His Majesty Umberto II, King of Italy. Lauro, like any good Italian politician, is at his heart a monarchist. What else is Italy if not a monarchy? But, he also understands the power the king wields in government, and now must make a good impression. Pulling up in the limousine to the Quirinal Palace, Lauro just had to take a moment to admire its grand architecture. Its magnificent spire sat outside, triumphantly soaring into the sky. It was evident much meticulous effort was put into the construction of such a building. But now was not the time to gaze at carved stone, now, Lauro had to conduct politics. Entering through its grand doors, he was ushered into a finely decorated room without much reception. After some 20 minutes passed, the door opened.\n\nIn stepped the king, followed in close stride by a servant. Lauro hastily stood and bowed. The king, in truth, cared not for such pleasantries and wanted to get down to business, much the same as Lauro. The servant was waved out of the room on a mission to bring the two men tea. The king casually sat down on the couch across from Lauro, forgoing much of any greeting but a cold handshake. Lauro didn't entirely know what to do, but took a seat regardless. There was a still tension in the room for the longest time as the two men eyed each other. Eventually, Lauro broke the ice by talking about the building itself, the furniture of the room, whatever else to get things going. By the time the servant had brought the tea, the two started to indulge in small talk. And, of course, they eventually reached politics. In Umberto's mind, Lauro associates are perhaps an antithesis to the democracy he has helped construct, but he is tolerable. And so, the conversation went on, and so did the cups of tea. The talking only truly ended when the kettle was empty."

 marsanich.9.t:0 "A Most Holy Meeting"
 marsanich.9.d:0 "Lauro was really starting to get sick of all these meetings. How many people did he have to talk with, eat with, shake hands with just to get what he wanted? A lot, apparently. And so it went on. Every week, he picked out the nicest suit he had, rode around in the limousine the government gave him, and met somebody of varying importance within the Italian hierarchy. And when it was done, he still had an entire day of work left! Madness, he thought, madness. If this is how frustratingly difficult being prime minister was, he would've never done it. At least today, he got to meet someone a little interesting.\n\nRiding into the Vatican is, technically, entering another nation. But, at the same time it is like crossing the street. Entering through the old and glorious marble structures, he finally received a warm reception. Bishops, cardinals, priests, all the like, greeted him. However, much like many of his other meetings, he was brought into a room and told to wait. The room he entered was not very quiet, however, cameras and their crews stood off to the wall and awaited the entrance of the man of the hour, the Pope. If the Pope liked the prime minister, it would be a comfort to much of Italy, being a catholic nation after all. And so, he entered, followed by a possy of different men in robes and suits. They both put on a good show for the cameras, discussing topics Lauro was told to talk about exclusively. And, at the end of it, perhaps the Pope really did like him, and with it the blessing of God."

 marsanich.10.d:0 "It was a warm, sunny day. Birds were chirping, flowers bloomed, and the sky cleared away entirely. The perfect day for political protests, surely! In Rome, the BN had decided to organize a rally for its members in wake of new tensions throughout the city, being the hotbed of politics within Italy. At the rally, there was more than just the average political guy who joined for something to do. Columns of BN "affiliates" lined the square, the very same affiliates which have been stirring up such a fuss for the past few weeks. Mostly what the average Italian citizen would consider an extremist, the groups caused a racket just getting to the parade square. For Lauro, managing these people was a nightmare, and standing on the stage above them he felt powerless. It is why he must get rid of them, eventually.\n\nA few blocks away, more activity was going on. Differing political groups had taken to the streets in an attempt to decry Lauro and his associates, regardless of their actual relationship. Polizia were dispatched to set up road barricades and control the protests' ever growing intensity. But it was for naught, and all they could do was sit by the side as the mob marched around, destroying cars, getting into fights, everything that makes a good protest. Lauro could hear their shouts, even from so far away, and worried about this rally of his. The current circumstances would have to do, so he thought. He had persisted through worse, and this will be no different."

 marsanich.11.t:0 "Needles To Our Backs"
 marsanich.11.d:0 "Lauro hated to admit it, as did many others in government, but the truth was clear. Every day, police officers were pushed to the brink with constant calls about an attack somewhere or the other. Lauro's desk was being tested by the countless reports of political terrorism and underground movements. Many feared to leave their homes, what if they became the next target of some violent paramilitary? It was clear the situation was only getting worse, and that the fires were only being stoked by some unscrupulous groups.\n\nThe reality was that Italian politics had changed, and changed very quickly it had. Now in part dominated by illegalized movements and paramilitaries, the wars of politics are no longer just fought in parliaments with words and paper, but also in the streets with knives and guns. It was something many refused to believe for a long time, but now every decision made must have its repercussions considered even more."

 marsanich.12.d:0 "Lauro walked to the memorial not in his typical confident, long strides, but in a solemn and hunched over shuffle. Laying a wreath of flowers at its base, it would serve as his commemoration to Piazza Fontana. Making sure to have a camera following him, there was an effort to publicize the event and make him more sympathetic in everybody's eye. But, deep down, Lauro truly did mourn the event. The atmosphere of years past had now clearly faded, replaced with one of violence and bloodshed in the name of political gain, and Piazza Fontana was the hallmark of it. When once you could walk the streets at night without fear, families now cower in their homes before it is even dark. Where you could interact with practically anyone without dread of their intentions, now many avoid even locking eye contact with others.\n\nYes, on that day, a piece of Italy died with the many in the explosion. It is now up to Lauro to try and restore that, or at least try. The deaths of those on that terrible day would not go forgotten under his watch, not for a long time."

 marsanich.13.d:0 "Every morning, the newspapers had their headlines plastered with the brand new scandal of the day, almost every time involving Achille Lauro as its main proponent. Everyday, somebody claimed to have finally exposed him for the extremist he is, or that he has been working with some group the equivalent of the Nazis and wishes to bring down hell on Italy. But today, it was different. The morning's timid quietness was suddenly broken by the cry of a paper boy.\n\n"Read all about it! Prime minister orders riot put down! Several injured in fight with police!" And so repeated these words many times, in many parts of the city, and eventually many parts of the nation. The day previously, one exceptionally large protest was getting too close to parliament for comfort. In a manner of minutes, riot boots were on the ground and tear gas canisters were being shot. Panic and chaos ensued, as it usually did, and rioters engaged the police in a brutal battle. Screams and shouts, punches and batons were thrown out across the street. By the end of the short lived carnage, the riot had dispersed and those unlucky ones were left on the street with several broken bones. And as Lauro slowly read the lines of the paper, he felt a mixed bag of emotions. The riot was suppressed, and the battle was over with him having won. But, any action always has its aftershocks. Anarchy is a springtrap always loaded, one wrong turn could be the one that opens it."

How he wished to simply run away to some Mediterranean island and never even speak the word politics again. But he knew that nothing would be happening until the plan is finished, one way or another. And so it went on. Today, he must make another plea to the people for their trust. Despite all his actions, or misactions, many still see him as an extremist, one that wishes to tear down everything Italy now is and spit on Ciano's work.\n\nOf course though, this couldn't be farther from the truth. But the reality of politics was that the truth isn't always what is believed, and Lauro knew this all too well. And so, as it was, he would host yet another press conference. The words he said were not as important as the message they conveyed, and sometimes getting the message through to the press is a nigh-on impossible task. He told them of his undying support of democracy and the values he and his predecessors have held up, of how much he loves the ballot box and not the will of dictators. Perhaps people did listen, but then again, they could very well have just not bothered. Maybe someone would read the speech on page 2, but others would be too busy flipping to the other channel or doing the crossword. He would get his message out, somehow."

You can't exactly fund a rally without the stuff, and you can't run a campaign if your bank account is negligible. So, if Lauro needed some extra cash, where could he find it? With the corporate fat cats, of course. And so a back alley meeting was organized, men from the government and guys from corporate.\n\nWalking into the old car park, Lauro felt as though he was about to be mugged. A sickly dampness wafted around the deteriorating concrete, and it was as though it could fall in on them at any given moment. At the center of the floor, a black van was parked, with three men in suits leaning against its side. To Lauro, this all seemed rather illegal, but whatever paid the bills. Meeting with the businessmen was an entirely different venture. The men themselves were the definition of sleazy, and their business reflected it. Fat cigars rolled around in their mouths, and they wore greasy suits with even greasier hair. The word crime just oozed from these guys, but they were cooperative. After some tense words were exchanged, they reached a mutual deal where Lauro would get his money and big corporate would get their power. Regardless of how these people were, Lauro could and had to look past it, for any of his plans to work."

He had been to ribbon cutting ceremonies, poverty shelters, local celebrations, festivals, parties, fancy dinners, scummy dinners, royal balls, military parades, regular parades, army encampments in Tyrol, naval stations in Sicily, and every goddamn Genoan farmers' wedding. All of these events, he was closely followed by a camera. The point of all this after all, was to make him be seen as strong, relatable and valiant to the Italian people in these trying times.\n\nWhether people actually bought it was an entirely different story. News reels and pictures of the prime minister's visit to a summer festival in Tuscany could be skipped in favour of yesterday's game. But, regardless, Lauro followed the close advice of his public opinion board; who could possibly just be feeding him bullshit while they collect a hefty pay cheque. Inevitably however, information will trickle out to people and make them think this way or that. Lauro would get his message read, come hell or high water."

Typically, businessmen don't like to have to run things by other groups before they do their business, but Lauro is confident he can sign them over with some sweet, black gold. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The two men entered, both exquisitely dressed, and both controlling shares in some of the most important sectors of the Italian economy.\n\"I'm glad you made it! Come, have a seat, take off your coat."\n\nThe businessmen were evidently in a relaxed mood, taking their good time in sitting down. Lauro was quite the contrary, finding difficulty achieving even a modicum of comfort in his chair, fidgeting with his thumbs as he formed the words in his mind.\n\n"I'm sure you know the government appreciates your time here today, as do I. I was hoping we could try to come to some sort of ag-" Lauro was cut short by the man sitting to his right.\n\n"Yes yes, to make a deal. Do you think we come into these things without previous knowledge of what we're doing, Mr. Lauro?" The man was clearly quite rude, but Lauro needed his cooperation.\n\n"Err.. Yes, well, I will be giving you the land rights to a few profitable Algerian oil fields for your support in a number of contracts."

His people hate him more by the day, and even his own government seems to have lost their trust in him. And everytime he reads an article about some kid gunned down on a street corner, or the police engaging with rioters, he loses a bit of trust in himself.\n\nIn the Italy of today, it is built as a house of cards. One little breeze, a protest suppression gone wrong, or a scandal sent out of control, is all it takes to knock it over. Lauro knows this, and the situation is pressed into his mind every time he has to meet with his advisors, or the police chief, or god knows who else. All of them will give him bad news.

Lauro realized that people like this would never listen to words, no matter how many documents you shove in their faces, no matter how many speeches you make asking them to stop. No, you have to make them stop. And so it was, on a bright, sunday afternoon, that the call went out across the nation.\n\nPolice vans rumbled to life in every major city in Italy. Roadblocks, barricades and boots on the ground were placed in every intersection. Protests were contained and shut down. Almost in the blink of an eye, the riot police were marching triumphantly against a crumbling tide of protesters. The brute force of the molotov cocktail and fist could not best kevlar gear and sturdy batons.\n\nBy morning, a strange sense of momentary calm had washed over the nation. Inevitably though, the press started printing. Lauro did not care, however. Those who threaten Italy would learn just what the answer to their actions was: a fist to the head and a jab in the gut."

 marsanich.20.d:0 "It was only a matter of weeks since what would become known as the Riots Reckoning had passed, but already calm had returned to the streets. Headlines were no longer repeating the words 'riot' and 'protest', and people could go out to the market without fear of being trampled by a mob of college students with signs. What was once a wave of anarchy that swept over Italy now disperses as protesters either go home or get locked up. Lauro's desk could now finally get a rest, no longer topped off by report after report of the hourly March on Rome. Lauro himself could now for once sit back and relax in his office, without being barged in on by a frantic intern with seven new letters from the chief of police.\n\nPublic reactions to the sudden change of atmosphere have certainly been varied. Some respect Lauro finally putting his foot down and teaching those no-good kids a thing or to. Others, not so much. But Lauro was used to it by now. The people don't have to love him, only tolerate him. And as he took that nap he has been waiting for, he rest easy knowing it was finally going according to plan."

 marsanich.21.t:0 "Lauro In The Limelight"
 marsanich.21.d:0 "After months upon months of pleading, press conferences, statements to the public and wishing, Lauro was finally getting what he wanted. A number of phone calls and exchanges with lower bureaucracy confirmed that any notions of him being an extremist have gone out the door, and that he is in the public what he wanted to be all this time, their prime minister. Very few criticize him for his beliefs, and he can show his face in the open without needing an entire security detachment to trail him.\n\nThe government itself has restored its faith in his leadership, and is not teetering on the verge of collapse anymore. Meetings run smoothly and efficiently, senators cooperate with government decisions and party rallies no longer end in bar fights and shanking. The legacy of Hot Autumn is long past. Lauro hadn't looked this carefree in months!"
 marsanich.21.a:0 "Finally, we're getting somewhere."
 
 marsanich.22.t:0 "The Comforting Fist"
 marsanich.22.d:0 "Many said it could not ever be done, but Lauro has proved them all dreadfully wrong. His popularity is skyrocketing, the people enjoying the state's ever so gentle hand on their shoulder. Riots and protests are a thing of the past, all of them dispersing and going home, as they should've long ago. Radicals and extremists are being hunted like wild game, cornered and brought to extinction.\n\nAll those who ever dreamt of threatening Italy, all those who dared to try it, have been served the answer to such acts. Never again will such things happen, not so long as Lauro is alive and breathing. Never again will citizens be afraid to leave their houses and never again will terrorism haunt Italy's people. It turned out that determination really would see the plan through, just as Lauro envisioned it."
 marsanich.22.a:0 "Peace at last."
 
 marsanich.23.t:0 "Everything Good Must Come To An End"
 marsanich.23.d:0 "Months of calm and peace had now passed in Italy, not one report of political violence or riots threatening to topple government. The police have never had so little to do, Lauro has never had so much freetime, and the press has never had so little to report on. But, as with all good things, it must end one way or another.\n\nLauro was awoken with a jolt as a subordinate slapped a newspaper onto his desk. He almost wanted to lambast the man there on the spot, but his eyes instinctively drew to the headline. "Aldo Moro reported missing, political scene in shock!" Really. Would the work never end? Lauro got up from his chair with a haggard sigh.\n\n"I want a full investigation conducted on this, bring in the chief of police here, we need things to move fast." The subordinate seemed to understand well enough and nearly hopped out through the door, not wanting to catch the prime minister in a bad mood. Lauro tossed his suit on hastily and strided out the door. Much more work was left."

We should strive to further increase this bureaucratic control of the economy by throwing more funding at our state apparatus, hiring more public clerks and administrators in order to further expand the institutions that are vital to the prosperity of our country."

ita_a_race_won_desc:0 "In the midst of chaos and ever increasing difficulties, the voice of moderation and sense has triumphed over the dangerous upstarts who threaten the delicate balance of Italian democracy. Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, after barely managing to secure leadership within his party, has carried it to victory in the elections - now, the DC stands to shape Italian politics as the new decade begins. Many things must be done in order to weather the difficult situation Italy finds itself in after Piazza Fontana - and the first priority is gaining total control over the Parliament. "

ita_clean_up_the_domus_mariae:0 "Clean Up The Domus Mariae"
ita_clean_up_the_domus_mariae_desc:0 "Despite not being a coalition, like the FD or the BN, the Democrazia Cristiana is far from being unified - despite the facade of unity that is shown off every year at the party congress in Domus Mariae. Several currents, cliques, and wings dominate its inner workings, and the party keeps itself together as a result of a delicate balance between all these different components. In order to truly dominate Italian politics, Fanfani must first dominate DC - and the Prime Minister has two ideas as to how to do that. The first would be concentrating on internal support from within the party, gathering supports from other cliques - the other would be seeking help from other moderate parties in order to solidify our government's stability."

ita_the_moderate_stronghold:0 "The Moderate Stronghold"
ita_the_moderate_stronghold_desc:0 "The young Italian democracy needs to be controlled by the only party which has championed liberalism, progressivism, and all the values that a moral, proper state should have - that party is DC. Prime Minister Fanfani must focus on making sure that all the most important factions of DC are under his wing - either through control or through appeasement. In particular, we must focus on the progressive politicians closer to Moro, the centrists of the Dorotei, and the more right wing figures of the party."

ita_take_over_moros_clique:0 "Take Over Moro's Clique"
ita_take_over_moros_clique_desc:0 "Aldo Moro is, alongside Fanfani, one of the most public and important figures of DC - and around him a numerous group of politicians has coalesced, made up of the more progressive minded members of the party. While Fanfani himself belongs to this group of politicians, he must now ensure that they answer to him, not to Moro, in his ploy to further his political clout. A few handshakes, promises, and promotions within the party should be enough to sideline Moro and make the progressive wing of DC depend entirely from Fanfani."

ita_control_the_dorotei:0 "Control The Dorotei"
ita_control_the_dorotei_desc:0 "Named after the Santa Dorotea convent in Rome, the Dorotei are sometimes considered the centrist grouping of DC - a sizeable number of politicians who are moderate liberal conservatives that are skeptical of leftist parties. Somewhat hostile to Fanfani, the Dorotei can still be reasoned with as long as we promise them to pass legislation favourable to their interests - namely, a strengthening of relationships with the Church and economic manoeuvres to help the industrial upper and middle classes of Italy. Those who don't want to reason with Fanfani, meanwhile, will be condemned to irrelevance within the party."

ita_enlightened_centrism:0 "Enlightened Centrism"
ita_enlightened_centrism_desc:0 "Finally, the other faction of DC which must be taken care of are the right wing. Staunchly opposed to Fanfani, these are conservatives who resent the progressive turn which Fanfani promises, and are much more friendly to the right wing parties. The only way for Fanfani to get them to play ball is to promise moderation in regards to his progressive policies - instead pursuing a centrist agenda of limited intervention. While it's not exactly what Fanfani has in mind, it will be necessary to ensure unity within the party itself."

ita_hog_the_spotlight:0 "Hog The Spotlight"

What the people need is reassurance - a friendly face, promising them that everything will be alright and that Italy is on the track to prosperity. That face has to belong to Fanfani. Whenever they turn on the TV or open a newspaper, Italians will find the calming smile of the Prime Minister - whenever they listen to the radio, they will hear his reassuring voice. Fanfani and the DC must dominate the media - and to do so, we must ensure that our control of RAI and other media outlets allows us to truly let our message reach the people."

Left and right, black and red, fascist and communist, extremism of all forms, shapes and colours is taking to the streets, wreaking havoc on our cities and harming innocent Italian citizens. The vast majority of upstanding Italians is of the same opinion, that these violent outbursts are simply unacceptable in our society - and we must make sure that they know that Fanfani shares their sentiment. With some help from our brave boys in the Polizia and the Carabinieri, these protests will soon be contained, and Italy won't be burned by the flames of radicalism."

ita_promise_peace:0 "Promise Peace"
ita_promise_peace_desc:0 "The reasons why political violence manifests are manifold, but most of them can be chalked up to economic reasons. Poor wages, increasing prices, long work hours, bad contracts - all of these are problems that can be fixed by the proper economic reforms. The bad spell that has befallen us in the last few months is well on the way to being fixed by Fanfani, DC, and our government, so there is absolutely nothing to worry about. The Italian people shall know that we are on the way to prosperity - so they just need to chin up, stop whining, and get to work. "

ita_vatican_ouvertures_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has always been one of the most important institutions in Italy, and even if indirectly, has always had a great influence on Italian politics. While our party is entirely independent from the Vatican, we could definitely enter negotiations with them - by renewing our Concordat mutual obligations, reviewing the status of Church managed institutions in the country, and supporting Catholic schools, we will be able to get the Vatican on our side. This might prove extremely useful in bringing peace to the country once more - the priests shall deliver their good word of nonviolence and opposition to communist materialism and fascist extremism to the masses, hopefully turning public opinion even more against these radical ideologies."

ita_convergenze_parallele_desc:0 "DC can be a den of snakes, and trying to get everybody in the party on our side might very well be equal to getting nobody to our side. Fanfani and his closest politicians must instead look for support elsewhere, in the broader spectrum of Italian politics - such as moderates in both the FD and the BN. This way, even if the party is largely against Fanfani, he can still maintain control of the government until the end of his mandate - then, what will come, will come."

Even outside of FD, Saragat is also a widely respected and popular politician - however, he still lags behind in popularity when compared to Pietro Nenni, leader of the Partito Socialista Italiano, and what's worse, a rising leftist tide coming from various small groupings and organizations within FD. By supporting Saragat and negotiating with him as the leader of FD, we will be able to ensure that the PSDI and the social democrats in FD gain the edge over the socialists, and thus open up to the possibility of an alliance between us and FD."

ita_the_kings_blessing_desc:0 "Few members of BN can be considered actual, bona fide fascists - many of them are actually national conservatives, monarchists and moderate nationalists who feel displeased by our progressive openings. While DC has always been a centrist party that looked to the left of the political spectre, we can attempt to extend an olive branch at them to garner at least external support for our government. By strengthening our commitment to the Italian monarchy and its institutions, we can attempt to show the moderates of BN that we're not dangerous subversives, but actually the best option to maintain the strength and prestige of Italy in these hard times."

ita_everything_is_under_control:0 "Everything Is Under Control"
ita_everything_is_under_control_desc:0 "While many members of our party have been displeased by our attempts to seek support elsewhere, as of now Fanfani's hold over Parliament is complete - with support from the PSDI and, more reluctantly, from the PSI, and at least without the open hostility of most of BN. Many Catholic and liberal minded voters, those friendly to the Dorotei and the right wing of DC especially, are displeased by Fanfani's decisions - but still, now the government has been stabilized, and that is everything that matters."

ita_the_white_whale_ascendant_desc:0 "During the darkest days of the fascist dictatorship, there was always a tiny light of hope - the Catholic world. These embers of Catholic cultural and political institutions, which Mussolini's autocracy could never truly stamp out, would eventually coalesce into a white flower of dazzling light - Democrazia Cristiana. Our party played a key role in transition to democracy - and under Fanfani's helm, it has managed to cement its control over the country. The future looks bright, and most of the Italian population, even though who are most bitterly opposed to us, have started to get used to the idea that DC, the White Whale, is here to stay, and it will dominate Italian politics for years to come."

Look at the horrors of Germany, is that what we wish to see visited upon our beautiful land? No, I think not. From this day forth, I call on all Italians to step forward together into a new age of peace and prosperity. We of the DC have the reigns in Rome, and we will work to achieve our goals for the country, but please, remember that if we are pushed against by those after their own gain, we will be able to achieve nothing. We call on all those interested in a better Italy to support us at every level of government whenever elections are held in the interest of creating a stable and united front for progress. I would remind all those who would protest this call, those of the BN and FD, that the people of Italy have given their mandate to us, and they would see it fulfilled. In the wake of all the tragedy and division, surely a stable order you disagree with."

The German's meddling was a setback to be sure, but not an insurmountable one by any means. Still, it will require some rather extensive reforms of our current policies if we hope to achieve the needed changes quickly. Taking it slow might work, but we now have voters who hold us accountable. Our experts have already begun drafting initial proposals for our first phase, namely devaluing the lira. If we manipulate our own currency just right, our exports should explode. Perhaps even more substantial will be the significant incentive our people will have to rely on imports when we have our own products that work just as well. Italy will no longer be a nation that is taken advantage of, it will be the one taking the advantage."

ita_revamp_the_export_infrastructure_desc:0 "How is international trade carried out is this brave new world we find ourselves in? The answer is largely the same as it has always been. Carried over land on roads and over seas by boats. The only major difference in how we conduct trade compared to our Roman forebears is that we possess the power to soar through the blue sky like eagles in our steel airplanes.\n\nIf we want to have an export industry that rivals the major powers, then we will need to pour all the funds we can muster into our roads, airports, and docks. Of the three, the airports should have the highest priority. After the damned Atlantropa forever destroyed our access to the Atlantic our seaborne trade has decreased significantly, only kept alive by our control of the Suez. Airplanes on the other hand have no such restrictions, and will surely be the transport method of the future.

By strategically manipulating the value of the prices and of the lira itself, we can incentivize an export focus among our people while at the same time we will be attracting foreign interest for the first time in decades. The money that American, Japanese, and German investors among others will start to pour into our hands and they rush to invest in our new economic hotspot will go a long way indeed. Some might protest our gaming of the economic system but so what? Money is what matters right now."

One needs to simply study the rise of Lenin and Hitler if proof is needed of this claim. In a democracy as young as ours, making sure that this group that can exercise far more power than they often realize understands that we will fight for them better than any fascist or communist is crucial. We will talk to their union leaders and their spokesmen in the coming weeks to assure them of this.\n\nCapitalism is often cited as the bane of the working class, but this is a statement born of ignorance. In reality, a capitalist system with an emphasis on allowing profit but not exploitation can deliver the enhancements to life without the bloodshed inherent to extreme ideologies."

Securing their blessing in moving forward will allow us to disseminate our message to the business owners quicker and will help in forming a stable backing of support in the future. The workers are critical of course but that doesn't mean we can forget about the employers so easily, we aren't communists after all. Our dream is to see workers and owners work hand in hand to create the bright future we imagine for Italy. The class struggle shall be a thing of the past and we need to communicate our good intentions to those who run the national industry."

ita_christian_capitalism:0 "Christian Capitalism"
ita_christian_capitalism_desc:0 "Fanfani is a deeply religious man, and has always been open about it. The DC platform is decidedly pro-capitalism in contrast to the FD, but that isn't to say the DC is ignorant of many of the criticisms lobbied against it by intellectuals and workers alike. A particular issue the DC has been forced to grapple with it the fact that capitalism often promotes behavior that is decidedly immoral from a religious point of view. That's where the idea of Christian Capitalism comes in. The desire to profit without causing harm is a key tenet of this philosophy. Time will tell of such an idea will be able to stand the test of practical application."

It is the time of wound that will likely never fully heal, but perhaps, with the passing of time and earnest efforts on our part to solve the underlying issues that led to this event, we can at least ensure that the wound does not become infected. Plaques will be set up, portraits of those who died in the bombing will be hung on the walls of the prime minister's residence in the Palazzo Chigi and the President's at the Palazzo del Quirinale. There will be time for changes and debates soon enough, but for now, the people of Italy stand side by side in the wake of tragedy. Hopefully such a spirit of national unity will not crumble into dust. That would be a further tragedy, and it would mean that those who died did so in vain. If we cannot come together now, then when?"

That is why all the resources at our disposal, civilian and military, public and secret, shall be mustered to answer every question about the incident. Who planned it? What was the motive? Was there outside support? What was the goal? At present there are many subversive groups who may have perpetrated this heinous crime. The fascists, willing to kill in order to bring back their old regime, or maybe the communists, eager to take advantage of the national turmoil to back their agenda. It could even be some other group of which we are unaware. Whoever it was, they shall be discovered and punished. Truth for the living, justice for the dead."

Facing him was the younger, somewhat disheveled FD representative, who was well known for his suspected communist sympathies. Across from and between both representatives sat Fanfani, who had called both of these two partisans in order to hammer out some sort of arrangement regarding the precarious civil situation within the country. Piazza Fantana had made it clear that the growing tensions between political groups was becoming a clear danger to state stability. If communists and fascists pushed each other too far... Fanfani didn't need to spell it out for the two gentlemen. As the night wore on it was clear that nothing concrete had been established, but, Fanfani thought to himself as he watched the cars pull away, they had agreed on a second meeting. Perhaps that was a victory after all."

Just look to the tax codes, where there are now more than a dozen changes that put more lira in middle class pockets. Or see the many new neighborhoods of government-funded housing programs that now dot cities from Sicily to Lombardy. We have even given incentives that allow even our poorest citizens to pull themselves into a better life. Of course, the people remember the good we have done when it matter, we will make sure of it.

Rather than presenting ourselves as brutes only interested in our own gain at the expense of all others, Italy shall now strive to find its place in the world standing beside its partners in trade and diplomacy. Diplomacy and trade are not zero sum games when played correctly; they can lead to the benefit of both players when one is willing to play honorably and amicably.

I am a man who knows my history well, and I am not interested in the least in repeating past mistakes.

The Americans have a very market-based system compared to ours, and while we are certainly not socialist, even we balk at allowing private corporate interests so much influence and power.

Private industry is both tolerated and promoted by DC, so long as it does not hurt others, but leaving something as vital to the people as fundamental as this is in the hands of profit driven men, however well intentioned, is unacceptable.

The current tax system is not a successful example of this balancing act, but it can be with enough tweaks. We aren't communists, we have no desire to redistribute wealth, but that doesn't mean we have no need for revenue. On the contrary, our social policies will require some tax increases in some areas. Still, we can hope to offset this with well-planned tax breaks and incentives for economically productive activities and programs. If we achieve our goal, the people of Italy will have no cause for complaint over how we collect our due money."

 POLITICS_GIORGIO_ALMIRANTE_DESC:0 "During the reign of Ciano, the empire was divided into two camps; those who supported the reforms and the uncertainty and hope they represented, and many bureaucrats, politicians and fanatics who opposed them. Everyone had to pick a side: for fascism or against it, for Ciano or against him, for the future or for the past, with no in between. Whenever Ciano spoke in Parliament, Giorgio Almirante clapped with the others, pledging his unwavering support. Whenever Scorza criticized the Duce of fascism, Almirante publicly mused about the need to protect the empire from its leader. In Verona, Almirante's name was in every conspiracy plotting for Ciano's removal - afterwards, he pledged to continue the great work of the last Duce.\n\nNow, with Italy once more thrown into uncertainty, who were the people to turn towards? As they did in the past, they turned towards those who could protect them, promising them bread and peace - they turned to Almirante. Affable, genial, kind-hearted and polite, Almirante presents himself as distantly as possible from the fascist firebrands that filled the ranks of the PNF - promoting unity and order against divisiveness and conflict, soothing the distressed Italian public.\n\nFew could have imagined such a victory for the Blocchi Nazionali, but Almirante showed the people a party that, while respectful of democracy, would still fight fiercely for what it stands for. What that exactly is, was never clear - it's possible Almirante himself doesn't know. Promising to uphold the legacies of both Mussolini and Ciano, there seems to be no way he can do both. With him and his party now at the helm of the nation, everyone in Italy and beyond seems to ponder the same question - will Almirante fulfill the destiny of Italy's new democracy, or kill it in its cradle?"
 POLITICS_PIETRO_NENNI_DESC:0 "The life of Pietro Nenni is one that seems more fit to the protagonist of an adventure novel, rather than to the leader of the new Italian left, and the new prime minister of the Kingdom. Born into a working class family and engaged in left wing politics since a very early age, Nenni closely befriended a young socialist named Benito Mussolini - even sharing a prison cell with him. After volunteering to serve in the Great War, he joined the fascist movement, quickly bailing out as he realized the dark turn it was about to take. His political convictions growing firmer, Nenni finally joined the Italian Socialist Party just one year before the march on Rome.\n\nNenni climbed the ranks of the PSI, but was powerless to oppose the newly instated regime, leaving Italy in 1926. This did little to stop him, and from abroad Nenni played a vital role in keeping the network of Italian dissidents and leftists that were opposed to the regime alive, with the PSI absorbing many other leftist parties over the years. Meanwhile, Nenni fought in Spain on the Republican side, was incarcerated multiple times, lost one of his daughters in the Auschwitz lager, and himself narrowly avoided falling in the hands of the Nazis (likely saved by his old friend Mussolini), before finally returning to Italy to witness the final fall of fascism.\n\nEver indefatigable, Nenni organized the many scattered leftist forces in the country into one more or less cohesive group - the Fronte Democratico, which he later carried to victory in the elections. The many promises he made to the farmers and workers of Italy must one way or another be kept - but only time will tell to what lengths Nenni, the fiery firebrand of Italian socialism, is willing to go in order to finally do justice for the long oppressed Italian people."
 POLITICS_ALDO_MORO_DESC:0 "Aldo Moro's rise to power is, according to many, reflective of Italy's own journey from fascism into democracy. Born in a small town in southern Italy, Moro began to study law in university, where he started to enter Catholic student organizations. Distinguishing himself as a brilliant student, he became the president of the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students, before being called to arms as an infantry officer during the Second World War. When the war ended, Moro moved his first steps in what would become his political career.\n\nMussolini's regime never quite managed to control the Catholic Church, and thus Catholic lobbies and pressure groups were always present during the fascist era. With Ciano's process of democratization, these lobbies and pressure groups became the foundational bedrock of what would become Democrazia Cristiana - and Aldo Moro had a key role in forming this united, Catholic and liberal front, striving to Italy the change she needs. Soft spoken, polite, well mannered, open to dialogue, Moro rapidly became one of the symbols of the rising Italian democracy, with DC electing him as the candidate for the position of Prime Minister in the elections.\n\nWith the victory of DC, Moro and his allies are free to enact their plans for change - without much ado and rhetoric, with moderation, politeness, and openness to compromise, Moro promises economic prosperity, stability, and a strong and fair democracy. While some divisions are already emerging in DC, with the more Catholic wing somewhat at odds with the more liberal one, the DC is united in their resolve to oppose radicalism, both red and black, and finally bring Italy out of the darkness and into the light. In difficult times, faith can be something to hold on to - and perhaps, with a little help from above, Moro's hopes for a free, peaceful and prosperous Italy will be realized."

 POLITICS_CARLO_SCORZA_DESC:0 "Carlo Scorza started his career in the PNF long ago, as he was among Mussolini's followers in the historic March on Rome. In time, after proving his loyalty and political skills, he rose through the ranks of the Party, finally becoming its Secretary in 1943. He hasn't left that position since, and for more than 20 years, he reinforced a sprawling network of political contacts and alliances. When Ciano became the face of fascism in Italy, stealing the limelight, Scorza remained in the darkness, preparing for the day when he could take what he deserved.\nMany people call what happened in Verona a "coup". To Scorza and his men, it is not so. He just fixed a malfunctioning element of the fascist machine: simply, he had to fix the fact that the position of Duce was occupied by a spineless worm named Galeazzo Ciano, who was ready to sell his own country from under his feet in exchange for "democracy" and US dollars. Italy, a nation forged by the flame of the fascist revolution, simply could not let it stand, and Scorza, by becoming Duce, only did his duty towards his country.\nIt was just the first step: in order to perfect the fascist machine, many things have to be fixed, reworked, and streamlined. Scorza has promised that he will cement the complete dominance of the party over the nation, and of the nation over the Mediterranean: his men rallied around his promises to rekindle the flame of the fascist revolution. The Duce made many promises, but it's hard to say how many of them will be kept. International observers fear the new Duce, lamenting that Italy has abandoned Ciano's promises of freedom: time will tell how much, if at all, Scorza will succeed in breathing new life into the fascist state, and what that will mean for Europe and the world."

 POLITICS_Augusto_De_Marsanich_DESC:0 "Among the many politicians of the BN who can boast a career dating back to the days of Mussolini, few can rival De Marsanich and his many years serving in politics. Serving as a member of parliament since the 1920s, De Marsanich held numerous offices before, during, and after the Second World War - and as the Duce died and a new one rose to take his place, De Marsanich immediately supported him and his projects. An old wolf of politics, De Marsanich knows that things change, and holding on to old symbols and ancient slogans is pointless - power belongs to the shrewd.\n\nOver the years, De Marsanich was fundamental in weaving together the BN from the remnants of the old PNF and other right wing groups, while Almirante was more preoccupied being the public face of the new party. However, with the catastrophe of Valle Giulia and the chaos of the Hot Autumn, the divisions within the BN threatened to rip apart De Marsanich's creation. Almirante had to go, and the party had to be taken into a new direction, one more willing to defeat the DC and the FD by their own rules - and De Marsanich, the grey eminence of the BN, was the best person to fill that role.\n\nPromising a return to law and order and the end of the red menace threatening Italy, De Marsanich appealed to the most base sentiment of the Italian populace - fear. By painting a grim picture of a nation in jeopardy, De Marsanich was voted in as the new Prime Minister to defend Italian democracy from itself - a leader of the people, an upholder of morals, and most of all a devout patriot. De Marsanich is all these things and more, but how he intends to save Italy from itself, is yet to be fully seen."
 POLITICS_Amintore_Fanfani_DESC:0 "Opinions about Amintore Fanfani tend to be varied, but there's one thing all agree on; that few can embody the soul of DC, with its infinite contradictions, better than him. Born into a poor family, Fanfani made a name for himself as a bright student and a professor of economics, but also as a staunch supporter of fascism. A devout Catholic, Fanfani at the time devoted his efforts to bridging the gap between the social doctrine of the Church and the fascist regime, even signing his support for the Manifesto of Race in 1938 and the other racial laws of the time.\n\nAs the years passed, Fanfani grew more and more disillusioned with fascism, drifting towards Ciano and his liberalizing politics. He was one of the chief architects of the DC, and eventually ended up as one of the leaders of the progressive current of the party. Opportunistic, shrewd and guileful, Fanfani always employed a smoke and mirrors approach to politics. A masterful negotiator, he was the perfect man to become the face of the DC after the crisis of the Hot Autumn.\n\nWith DC's victory in the elections, Fanfani is now free to openly play his political games. Behind the calls for moderation, progressivism and a fair and moral society, the Prime Minister knows that he is the only thin line standing between Italy and utter catastrophe. Compromise is viewed by many as a drawback, but for Fanfani, the Purebred Horse of DC, it is a weapon in his arsenal. The political machine of DC is the only one that can control Italian politics. Opposing parties, both right and left, will learn that the only way to survive in this house of cards is bowing to Fanfani's vision. A new director has entered the Italian political stage of Italian politics, and one way or another, he'll make sure that the whole orchestra plays to his tune."
 POLITICS_Giuseppe_Saragat_DESC:0 "Until just a few months ago, to most Italians Giuseppe Saragat was only one among many politicians making up the FD. Born into a middle class family in Turin, Saragat is almost the polar opposite to Nenni and his firebrand leadership, despite the two of them having a lot in common - both were exiled during the years of fascism, and both came back to rebuild an Italian left from the ashes. However, while Nenni fought his battles for democratic socialism, Saragat, with much less ado, rallied around himself the moderates of FD.\n\nWith the end of the fascist era, what the people needed was a reformist, a clean break from the past - a leader like Nenni. However, things have changed - and Italian democracy is already threatened from all sides. The chaos of the Hot Autumn and the recent wave of extremist terrorism have shaken the conscience of many, and as calls for moderation and peace rise from all side of the political spectrum, Saragat was the perfect candidate to become the polite and friendly face of the left.\n\nBy appealing to moderates and centrists, Saragat was able to paint himself as the candidate of peace and reconciliation - exactly what much of the Italian populace wishes for. Still, many are displeased with the new Prime Minister, especially in his own party. The growing radical faction of the FD is alienated by Saragat's alliance with DC, and despite all the promises, the violence in the streets of Italy shows no sign of stopping, rather appearing to escalate by the week. It takes courage to call for peace and democratic values as everything seems to be falling apart - and Saragat's resolve to hold firm against extremism and bloodshed might be the only thing that can save Italy's young democracy from an early end."
 POLITICS_ENR_MATTEI_DESC:0 "Long before beginning his tenure as Governor of the Gulf, Enrico Mattei was one of the most powerful men in the Empire. Known for his disdain for politics and his little sympathy for fascism, Mattei spent his whole life doing business - from a humble start, he soon entered AGIP, the Italian state's oil company. There, he rose through the ranks, climbing the company's hierarchy before becoming its head just after the end of the war. Yet, Mattei's ambition was far from being satisfied.\n\nAs the Empire grew massively during the war, it found itself in control of a staggering amount of rich oil reserves. A new situation required new methods, new technology, new organization, new trade deals - more wells, more refineries, more workers, more money, more oil. AGIP grew under Mattei's direction, until it was finally reorganized into ENI, an industrial and financial behemoth capable of standing toe to toe with Japanese zaibatsus. From his new headquarters in the Gulf, Mattei watched his own empire grow, becoming the main architect of the Dubai Project - a shining city in the desert, which began as a pet project of fascist colonialism and turned into a capital for Mattei's oil kingdom.\n\nAfter the Italian victory against Turkey, Mattei made another grab for power, and pushed for his nomination as Governor of the Gulf. As the oil king's rule was recognized, his plans for reform in the country are already becoming reality, as he brings the local emirs into the colony's government, while at the same maintaining a cautious friendship with the Saudis - something his critics often point out. With Dubai firmly in Mattei's hands, his ambition has been given new and powerful tools - after all, if ENI prospers, Italy prospers, and now ENI's six legged dog roars a flame that burns brighter than ever."
 POLITICS_GG_ORIANA_DESC:0 "For many in the Regia Marina and in all of Italy, Giuseppe Oriana is the archetype of an officer and a gentleman, something which attracts towards him admiration and envy in equal amounts. Serving with distinction in World War Two as a lieutenant, Oriana was again and again at the forefront of the Italian navy's greatest victories in the Mediterranean, rising through the ranks before finally becoming admiral after the end of the war.\n\nKnown for his effective style of leadership and his attitude towards innovation and modernization in the nautical arts, he soon became disliked in the upper echelons of the Italian government as an outspoken critic of fascism. Eventually, Rome found the perfect place to employ Oriana's talents, one as far away from Italy as possible: the Persian Gulf. Leading the Regia Marina's Fourth Naval Division, admiral Oriana successfully eliminated piracy from the region, allowing the Gulf to prosper and the Dubai Project to continue.\n\nHowever, things took a turn for the worse. With the Italian defeat against Turkey, a shockwave of instability spread across the Middle East, and as the local emirs become more and more intolerant of Italian rule and turn to Riyadh instead, Oriana was named governor of the Gulf, as his Fourth Naval Division is the only force strong enough to provide stability in the region. With the Dubai Project now coming to a crashing halt, Oriana must do whatever necessary to maintain order - quickly understanding that the emirs' tyrannical and petty rule is the greatest obstacle in his path. Even as a storm approaches from the desert, admiral Oriana is ready to withstand it - and should everything truly fall apart, the new Governor knows that a captain's duties include going down with his ship."

 POLITICS_Achille_Lauro_DESC:0 "'O Comandante. For his supporters, an emblem of respect and praise, for his enemies, the name is an ironic joke, a pretentious title with little behind it. Whatever you call him elsewhere though, in Naples they call him 'Mayor Lauro', and you had better have some respect in your voice while saying it. He is beloved by many and reviled by some, and for better or worse, Achille Lauro is now the second prime minister of a new Italy.\n\nAs owner of the Flotta Lauro that gave jobs to much of Naples, Lauro found it easy enough to transfer his business success into political power. Further helping him was his close friendship with the Ciano family. A man of the people despite his extreme wealth, Lauro endeared himself to the voters as president of the revered Naples football team and promoted public welfare projects that gave housing to the poor and jobs for the workers.\n\nIdeologically, Lauro has been considered a mixed bag, a man of contradictions. Unlike others in his party, Lauro has been a strong supporter of democracy in Italy, putting him at odds with fascist holdouts within BN. Lauro is a monarchist at heart, and has a warm relationship with Umberto II. Hewing back to his days as mayor of Naples, Lauro has championed numerous populist economic and social reforms, vowing to stamp out the last vestiges of anarchism and communism within Italy while offering alternative economic policies to better the lives of the everyday worker. Lauro's work is cut out for him, Italy may be destined for greatness, but it will require a firm hand and an iron will to achieve them. The great ship of state shall sail smoothly with 'o Comandante at its helm!"

You're probably wondering how I got into this situation, making the biographies for all of the leaders in the game and now being the leader of an abomination against humanity. In fact I probably look a bit older than I should.\n\nIt's a long story, really.

It was a real tight gig I had, chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool. We'd then play some bball out by the Soviet Naval War Academy in Leningrad. So anyway, I'm chilling with a hot babe, like total 10/10 Lithuanian girl named Lina who was totally groupieing us hardcore sailors, when BAM! Time vortex, shot me out here and Lina probably in the Ice Age or something.\n\nSo anyway, here I am in Leningrad, 'cept it ain't really Leningrad, it's some new name and everyone looks real angry.

 itademdiplo.1.t:0 "The Prime Minister's Speech"
 itademdiplo.1.d:0 "The atmosphere was solemn at the Camera dei Deputati, the Lower Chamber of the Italian parliament, where the entire parliament had been summoned for a common session of both Chambers. King Umberto II sat on the chair usually reserved for the President, at his sides were the Presidents of both the Chamber and the Senate, and the entire parliament, almost a thousand people, was silent, for the Prime Minister, sitting on the chair right below the King and surrounded by his ministers, was scheduled to announce the new foreign policy of the Kingdom. [ROOT.getleader] stood, facing the assembly, and feeling the King's eyes burn holes into his back: he knew that the King's support depended on whether he could truly protect the Kingdom from the enemies lurking outside, so he had to make a good initial impression. He nervously cleared his throat, gave a last look to his papers, then commenced.\n\n"Honoured members of the Parliament or, in the ways of our ancestors, Patres Conscripti! Today is a momentous day for our young democracy, as we shall decide the place our beloved Kingdom will take among the great powers of the world, as it should have always been, and as it will always be from now on!" A small round of applause from his majority, silence from the rest of the hemicycle. "After twenty years of isolationism, decided by cowards who could only try to avoid being washed away by the newly rising tide of freedom, we shall look outside! For the first time in decades, this government will make contact with the nations in Europe that still have to see the light of democracy, or have been forcibly blinded to it. We shall fight alongside them against those who would extinguish our flame! A new dawn has risen for Italy, and it will far outlast the night we leave behind our shoulders!"\n\nThis time, the applause came from the entirety of Parliament, even the opposition MPs begrudgingly clapping their hands, though for [ROOT.getleader] the greatest satisfaction came from the quiet clapping he could hear coming from directly behind him. As he sat down to let the Minister for Foreign Affairs speak in detail, he knew he had set the first stone."

 itademdiplo.2.d:0 "The Italian embassy in Bucharest was a small palace in the centre of the city. Though well-kept, and patrolled by a small garrison from Italy, it showed - as everything in Romania these days - the passing of time, with a bit of plaster falling and some ivy growing on the walls, giving it an air of placid laziness. Until a few weeks ago, the most activity one could see there was a few Italian expatriates visiting the embassy for documents, or the annual courtesy visit from the Romanian minister for foreign affairs.\n\nNow, everything has changed.\n\nThe entire building has been renovated by a cadre of architects, and colourful Carrara marbles shine on the new, monumental stairway and in the graceful columns supporting the neoclassical façade. Even the inside has been completely renovated: engraved mahogany furniture, sporting those intricate wooden mosaics so loved by Charles Albert, embellish the official meeting rooms, while in the corridors, precious glass vases from Murano peek out from equally valuable showcases.\n\nEven the personnel has been overhauled, with more than forty new diplomatic officials being admitted, among which are economic, military and political attachès, and a cadre of bureaucrats and entrepreneurs. The Italian embassy in Bucharest is now a shining beacon of beauty and efficiency in the beleaguered East, and if everything goes as it should, soon it will bring light to all of Romania."

Valets, chamberlains, butlers and maids moved with practiced hurry through the long corridors as they prepared everything to perfection, while in the basement, vans filled with the best delicacies from across the Empire unloaded their precious cargo: wine from Veneto, grapes from Athens, coffee from East Africa and many, many others, in preparation for the grand banquet.\n\nThe next day, the Romanian monarch arrived in Rome: while the governments of the two nations started talking about alliances, treaties and incentives, the two monarchs retreated into Umberto's private study to talk about more... delicate business. Everyone knew the one holding the true power in Romania was the King, and that's exactly where Umberto II came in: he believed, as Michael was a moderate at heart, and strongly admired his Italian counterpart for having managed to restore democracy to his country, that with enough effort, he could be set on the same path. When both Kings were seated, a coffee on the small table set before them, Umberto smiled courteously towards his guest: "Dear Michael" he began, "There is so much we have to talk about...".\n\nThe meeting lasted well into the evening, but when the two Heads of State presented themselves to the press, everyone could notice Umberto's triumphant smile, and their joint declaration about "common views" and "the Crown ultimately serving the people" left little room for doubts on the meeting's results."

The regent is a sad, greying old man who sits in wait for the return of a king never to come. In short, they are broken and ripe for the taking if we but seize the opportunity."

More than that, it lay almost entirely unchallenged by any significant opposition. Under Horthy, that is, but Horthy is no longer in charge, and the new regent, Béla Imrédy seems to lack either the charisma or the good luck to maintain such a grip over his own party. Now, the formerly monolithic coalition has begun to fracture and pull apart at the seams with the conservatives, monarchists, and out-and-out fascists openly vying for influence. Such division may prove to be the least of the regime's problems however, as now even opposition parties have begun to show signs of life, and what's more, of a willingness to fight. For the Hungarians, this is a headache, but for us, this could prove advantageous. We can leverage factions against one another, finding those who are sympathetic and backing them while pushing down those who may be less susceptible."

This lack of success on his part has made the regent many a powerful enemy within Hungary, and by all accounts has driven him to desperation if not paranoia. After all, a leader who lacks support even within his own party is a man with cause to worry.\n\nOn the other hand, a beggar can hardly choose from whom he can take support from, and if say, the Empire were to offer assistance to such a man, it would naturally follow for that individual to express their personal gratitude for said support."

Pity for them, that the sting of betrayal lands harder than the blow of an adversary.

Our government maintains only tenuous control over Hungary's hinterlands, and with the financial boost the Italians offer, we could integrate the countryside with a modern rail system, and help to bring our nation into the future. On the other hand, this could be the foot in the door of the "heirs of Mussolini" desire to eventually reduce our nation to nothing more than a Roman puppet.

The BN's victory in our country's first democratic election has proven our people's martial spirit, and their commitment to an Italy that stands shoulder to shoulder with the great powers of the world, and faces them as an equal.\nBut to do this, we must first have a military worthy of a great nation. Thankfully, with just a few small improvements, the Regio Escrito will serve to take our national spirit into the future.

 ita_the_newest_in_torpedo_bombing_desc:0 "Small enough to fit inside the smallest gunboat, and powerful enough to sink a battleship, torpedoes are perhaps the most lethal naval armament ever invented. With our experience in the field - the Regia Marina was, after all, the first to deploy torpedo boats, the "Maiali" - we shouldn't fall behind in the field, and strive to always improve our torpedoes.\n\nTaking from the best, such as the Japanese "Long Lance", we can ensure even our smallest ship is enough to send the enemy into a panic!"
 
 ita_look_into_the_air:0 "Look Into the Air"
 ita_look_into_the_air_desc:0 "The Regia Aeronautica has a grievous, but fundamental task: ensuring that our skies remain clear from enemy aircrafts, and providing support to our advancing armies. Should an enemy manage to achieve air supremacy over Italy, our cities would crumble under the bombs, our industry would cease to function, and our war effort would eventually grind to a halt as our army is no longer able to fight effectively, and our people is too exhausted to keep believing in victory.\n\nAs such, we must ensure our Air Force is always up to the task, as the consequences of failure are too dangerous to even consider..."
 
 ita_a_helping_hand_for_our_pilots:0 "A Helping Hand For Our Pilots"
 ita_a_helping_hand_for_our_pilots_desc:0 "While the brave pilots of the Regia Aeronautica are unyielding in their commitment to their nation, they are somewhat lacking in training in modern air doctrine. This is no fault of their own, but rather thanks to the ineptitude of lackeys and cowards who have long sabotaged Italian greatness. \n\nThankfully, with the BN in power to guide the nation to its glorious future, this problem will soon be rectified. By instituting a rigorous program of training and study, we will see to it that our pilots are equal or greater than any nation that dares to challenge us, capable of both defending our nation and raining fire on its enemies.\n\n"
 
 ita_a_new_aa_program:0 "A New AA Program"
 ita_a_new_aa_program_desc:0 "Anti-aircraft weaponry evolves just as its intended target does. As fighters become faster and even more agile, new, improved aiming systems are required, so that our bullets won't just draw pretty lines in the sky while the enemy pilot laughs. Also, since bombers are now able to fly at such heights that traditional AA isn't even able to spot them, much less actually fire at them, we should fund a project to devise self-aiming, missile-driven AA batteries, capable of piercing the very clouds and automatically search and destroy their prey."
 
 ita_rewards_for_results:0 "Rewards For Results"
 ita_rewards_for_results_desc:0 "While the common Italian aircrew is both loyal and capable, our ability to translate that into battlefield performance remains stymied by the antique doctrine and incentives that have long limited our military. Thanks to these foolish doctrines, rewards and promotions are based almost entirely on patronage and seniority rather than performance. This results in an airforce of old men and toadies, more interested in faking battle reports than actually fighting.\n\nWe will slash through these outdated ideas with vim and vigor, and replace them with a system of carefully calibrated rewards that assures that new ideas are actually incorporated into the Airforce, and the best pilots have the opportunity to spread their capabilities to others. \n\nSoon the rot will be purged, and the Italian nation will rule the skies of the Mediterannian as it does the sea and the land."
 
 ita_night_combat_training:0 "Night Combat Training"
 ita_night_combat_training_desc:0 "Fighting in the skies at night is a daunting task. As nothing but black surrounds the pilot, he can't even use the ground to orient himself, and the risk of being attacked by unseen aircraft is higher than during the day: the Russian "Night Banshees" exploited the darkness and the fact that their old planes were almost soundless to surprise the Germans, with lethal results...\n\nTherefore, our planes should be fitted with improved tracking equipment, to help the pilot spot and properly engage his target. Also, pilots need additional training in how to react to surprise attacks without breaking formation or risking to be shot by enemy AA."
 
 ita_safe_and_sound:0 "Safe and Sounds"
 ita_safe_and_sound_desc:0 "Although the performance of the Italian Air Force improving by the day (as measured by our new testing protocol), it is becoming increasingly apparent that one of the most pervasive problems in our airforce is the lack of proper safety protocols. Planes are often flown despite serious defects, and repair crews are poorly equipped and trained. This despicable state of affairs puts both our pilots, and the nation as a whole at risk. Unless these problems are immediately rectified, we risk losing what capable talent our nation does possess \n\nThankfully, the BN has always been committed to proper reform, and so we shall implement new standards and regulations to keep our Ace's doing what they do best. No more will the Italian airforce be known as a flier of shoddy and substandard planes, but rather as a fully capable modern force, able to stand up to any who would challenge it."
 
 ita_standardize_aa_emplacements:0 "Standardize AA Emplacements"
 ita_standardize_aa_emplacements_desc:0 "Throughout the years, we have devised and built several anti-aircraft weapon systems. While they are all useful at what they do, the excessive variety in weaponry and ammunition puts a strain on our logistics: therefore, we should creat a commission with the task of standardising our AA equipment and their emplacements. With better coordination, and a precise knowledge of what kind of weapons go against what aircraft, we will greatly increase our efficacy in fighting enemy incursions, and at the same time ease our supply lines and our quartermasters' job!"
 
 ita_approach_uncle_sam:0 "Approach Uncle Sam"
 ita_approach_uncle_sam_desc:0 "Although our nation has had a mixed history regarding the Americans, especially given their deplorable tendency to interfere with anything they can, we can't deny that they know how to fly a plane. \n\nDespite whatever high-minded ideas the Americans possess about "proper democracy" and "barely disguised Fascism" we're certainly preferable to the German beast, or Japanese scourge. Without a doubt, once we remind America of this reality, they will assist us in our airforce modernization efforts.\n\nAfter all, we are both eagles, and heirs to Rome. One in truth, and the other in spirit. Soon the master of the Americas and of the Mediterannian will join forces, and the world will tremble before their might."
 
 ita_bring_in_the_regia_marina:0 "Bring In The Regia Marina"
 ita_bring_in_the_regia_marina_desc:0 "Perhaps most of all out of the Italian Military, the Regia Marina is the pride of the nation, and holds a key place in securing its future. Without the Italian Navy, the Axis would have folded beneath the might of the deplorable british, and Italy would still be a nation of slaves, deprived of its true potential. \n\nHowever, the Atlantropa disaster, along with our still persistent economic and political issues has led to an unfortunate stagnation of the Regia Marina. Our great ships rust in port, our sailors spend their days getting drunk and playing dice, and war widows weep to see what the pride of Italy has become. \n\nUnless we can reverse these tragic circumstances, our future as master of the Mediterannian looks dim. Thankfully, with the BN now firmly ensconced in our government, Mare Nostrum will be complete once more. We will appoint new officers to clean out waste and corruption and re-evaluate our budgetary priorities to make sure our brave men are equipped with exactly what we need.\n\nSoon, Rome will once again be a sea power to be feared."

#Scorza 1970s Events#

scorzaseventies.1.t:0 "An Alpine Meditation"
scorzaseventies.1.d:0 "The fire crackled and danced, the light from it illuminating the otherwise cold and dark room. In an old chair in front of the fire sat an old and tired king, a cup of tea in his hand. He sipped it as the wind outside caused the window's to creak and moan, little frost angels appearing and just as quickly melting away by the heat emanating from the fire. \n\nA door creaked open and his son entered, slowly taking a seat next to the king in order to not derail the old man's train of thought. As he gazed at the man's tired and unfocused gaze, the Crown Prince without even thinking reached out and took his father's hand. \"Come to bed father, it's getting late. Whatever is troubling you so, I'm sure sitting here and staring off into the fire isn't fixing it.\" \n\nThe old man didn't react for an uneasy couple of seconds before slowly, he turned his head to look at his son, a tired look in his eyes. \"I can't... I haven't managed to have a good night's sleep since that man, Scorza, survived the latest round of protests. He's planning something, I can sense it, and I... I feel as if I'm playing chess against a man who I can't even see the pieces of. No matter what I do I... I... need to get some sleep...\"\n\nWithout another word, the old man got up from his chair and made his way to his room, leaving his son alone with the dying fire."

scorzaseventies.2.t:0 "A Letter to the Youth" # Scorza and the PNF publish a new doctrine of fascism, formalizing what they've done as fascism, giving ground to their reformism being part of fascist doctrine
scorzaseventies.2.d:0 "\"Students and children of Italy, lend me your ears and your hearts for just one moment!\" \n\n\"I have, since the moment of assuming power, strove to prove only one thing: that fascism is not a decrepit doctrine of your parents and teachers, but instead a doctrine for all Italians including you. It is undeniable that the civil, political, and economic victories given to you by my leadership have made the Italian people the bane of the world. From the decadent dance halls of New York to the poverty ridden slums of Bangladesh, all silently wish that they could have had the good fortune to have been born an Italian. Tell me, are these fruits something that a decrepit and fixed dogma could have produced? The answer to that is of course, no.\" \n\n\"Fascism is a living, breathing idea, one that has changed for today's generation just as it will change for the generation after us. Fascism can not die for it is eternally living. Fascism can not be displaced and rejected by the future for it is the future. Fascism is an ideology that will never falter, never stumble, never be replaced. It is the only ideology that can truly guide Italy to the destiny she deserves. \n\nI will end this letter by promising that the best days are still ahead for not just us, but for fascism itself. Avanti Italia!\""

scorzaseventies.3.t:0 "Scorza's Absurdity" # Term limits established for Il Duce, this was surprisingly done by Scorza, this is weird? Is he planning something?
scorzaseventies.3.d:0 "When the rumor had first reached his hotel room in Rome, the New York Times foreign consultant who received it had skimmed it, written it off as a prank, and then proceeded to crumple the report up and toss it into the trash. The very idea that report had suggested was, to put it bluntly, completely and utterly fucking absurd. An authoritarian fascist state such as Italy, one that refused to leave behind the 1930s like much of the world had outside of its Duce's often strange reforms and proclamations about fascism was a consistent actor, a rational actor. The idea of such a state changing its entire system so radically by implementing something as ill defined as term limits? Total poppycock. \n\nSeveral days had passed without any updates to suggest such a policy was truly to be implemented and, much to neither his future shame nor pride, the foreign correspondent had more or less written off the rumor. And then, at only a little past eight in the morning, he was awoken to the sounds of students marching and cheering in the streets. Opening the blinds, he peaked through to see a mass of young fascists and veteran blackshirts, some carrying portraits of Scorza and others waving around letters. As he stared at this demonstration, amused, he picked up his hotel room's telephone and dialed the correspondent for the Washington Post. \n\n\"Morning Jack.\" \n\"Morning Steve\" \n\"Hey, do you know what the demonstrations are for today?\" \n\"You haven't heard yet man? It's the strangest thing I've heard in all my years of working this beat. Scorza himself went on the radio this morning and announced that he's putting a limit on how many years someone can be Duce, it's got the youth all abuzz with hopes for further reforms.\" \n\nThe foreign correspondent was silent for a long time before speaking again."
scorzaseventies.3.a:0 "\"What?\""

scorzaseventies.4.t:0 "Greeting the Future" # Huge rally with Scorza leading, he's looking frail but as excited as ever!
scorzaseventies.4.d:0 "The old man stood at the back of the rally, his grandson excitedly cheering the man taking the stage in front of them. A new generation of Blackshirts stood in front of Il Duce, ones who had never known the struggles of the earlier days, experienced the first march all those years ago which brought Il Duce to power in the first place. It filled his old heart with joy to see the youth follow the same light that he had all those years ago. \n\nHis mind began to drift as he thought about it, images appearing in his head as he did so. 1922, the year it all began, Blackshirts marching proudly through the streets of Rome as the radios played news of the King's capitulation. Fourteen years later, the triumph in Ethiopia. His mother had been so proud to see her boy returning as a war hero. Another nine years later, the victory celebrations in Rome, Mussolini raising his hands in triumph as he declared Italy victorious. On the stage, Scorza raised his own hands in victory, and unnoticed by the old man, his grandson cheered. \n\nSeveral years later, Il Duce had died, Ciano was in power now. Chaos in the Mediterranean, uncertainty for the future of the movement he had dedicated so much to. More rallies, more bombs, war in the Orient as the Turks stabbed us in the back. He was there at his son's funeral, the other members of his squad and old blackshirts in attendance with him. Another year later, the triumph of Scorza fills his heart with hope once more, more marches, more victories, more pride in his homeland with every passing day. On the stage, Scorza calls out to the youth, who enthusiastically cry back, swearing their allegiance to fascism. \n\nEven more years, his grandson becoming active in party politics much to his quiet pride. The years begin to blur as the man thinks through it all. He looks up at Il Duce on the stage. He looks frail, so frail, just like him. His Grandson, God bless his soul, had gotten so excited by Il Duce's declarations that he had pushed through the crowd to cheer on the Black Shirts. A smile crept onto his face as he watched this, a single tear running down his cheek."

scorzaseventies.5.t:0 "Fascism for the Common Man" # Fascism begins to have representation of the common man, an odd advancement in doctrine, but no one seems to oppose this radical ideal.
scorzaseventies.5.d:0 "The pamphlet had arrived in a specially marked envelope, the PNF symbol clearly printed on the outside of it. Similar envelopes had, over the past week, been sent to nearly every household in Italy deemed \"politically palatable\" by the party bureaucracy in line with the directive sent down from the top. Some of the bureaucrats who compiled this had, naturally, been bewildered by the implications of the order but, it was not their place to question the wisdom of Il Duce. \n\nWhen anyone would open the envelope, they would find a simple pamphlet folded in half. Unfolding it, a simple introductory message was present, informing them that they had been selected to help influence the future of fascism within Italy. Several rows of questions were present, each one offering a different proposed policy and a scale going from \"Very Unfavorable\" to \"Very Favorable\" in order for the person filling out the pamphlet to offer his view on the matter. Questions had, of course, been carefully drafted in such a way to ensure a \"desirable\" response from the voters while also not appearing to be clearly biased towards any position. It had taken quite a few frustrating nights to achieve this, but as they say, nothing good can be produced without a little elbow grease."

scorzaseventies.6.t:0 "Controlling the Party" # Threaten the opponents of our efforts and maybe bribe them (conservatives)
scorzaseventies.6.d:0 "It had been a busy week for his squad, far busier than even during the riots and upheaval of the oil crisis. Every Monday a new letter was delivered to an unmarked post box with a list of names, most of them no name minor bureaucrats and officials within the PNF. Each name would be underlined with one of three colors, the number of colors oftentimes corresponding with any other equipment given to his squad with the letter. \n\nIf a name was underlined in red, the order was to find and intimidate the person. Couple bruises, maybe even a broken bone if they were being stubborn. Just enough to get them to shut up and follow orders. If a name was underlined in gold, the order was to try and bribe them, usually with auxiliary funds provided for the mission. Course, some people weren't interested in being bribed with money, so if necessary additional names would be provided for prostitutes, drug dealers, and anything else that's exotic. Finally, if a name was underlined in black... well, it didn't take much to figure out what that meant. \n\nLooking at the list he had received today, he saw five names. Three were underlined in red, a group of local politicians who hung around at the same cafes and smoked the same cigars, each one more conservative of a fascist than the next. Next name was underlined in gold, some local stockbroker. A few gold coins had been provided with the letter, ones that looked like they dated all the way back to when Venice had a Doge, so that seemed self explanatory enough. Final name was underlined in black, some local policeman and hardline fascist. He pitied the poor man as he drew his gun and loaded it. Policing could be such a dangerous profession."

scorzaseventies.7.t:0 "Dual Meetings" # "the plan" comes together, scorza meets with Borghese, Umberto gets more weary, forshadow to him calling Sogno
scorzaseventies.7.d:0 "At exactly six in the evening, two cars departed from two different residencies on two different sides of Rome. In one car traveled Junio Borghese, a close friend and ally of Il Duce, and in the other car traveled the Crown Prince of Italy, a look of worry on his face. Both had vastly different reasons to travel to meet their respective confidants, yet like most things in politics, it would be lying to say that they weren't connected. As they traveled, both men were left to their own thoughts as their respective drivers navigated the often busy and twisting streets of the capital. \n\nBorghese, an old man who still burned with passion and love for Fascism, considered every angle of the plan he had been sent last night in a letter. It was bold, to be sure, but such boldness was necessary to push Italy forward onto the world stage. It would take much effort to build the web of networks the Duce had asked for, but for him, no effort was too large to protect the ideology he truly loved. \n\nFor the Crown Prince, his trip was much less pleasant. Every mile of it he was left thinking about his father and his state of mind, and the letter a servant had slipped to him when they were sure any prying eyes weren't watching. It was from his father to a certain general -which one he couldn't tell due to the name being written in code- requesting an urgent meeting with him at once. He had no way of knowing for sure why his father had done such a thing, but he had a pretty good guess. \n\nScorza. That damned rat was constantly scheming and plotting something, and whatever he had cooking this time, it certainly could not be good. He had succeeded all those years ago to shut the page that was about to turn, and he would be damned if he was going to allow him to do it again. Leaning forward, he told his driver to step on it."

scorzaseventies.8.t:0 "Playing Hardball" # the court is now separate from other bodies, scorza is always right y'know don't be messing around court
scorzaseventies.8.d:0 "It had taken every ounce of skill the party bosses had to force through the new directive sent down from the top. Many had felt almost helpless when first reading it, unsure exactly how they were to so fundamentally change decades of passed laws and indeed, the very constitution itself in the time allotted to them. Still, it was quite clear that failure in this matter was not an option, especially with the number attached to the notice. \"1-49\", or as some quickly recognized it to mean, January 49: the month Caesar crossed the rubicon. \n\nWith an iron grit of determination, the party bosses set to work implementing the directive. Every favor earned through years of service was called in, a virtual media block out was carried out to ensure the King's allies would be blindsided when the announcement was made. Eyes were kept on every individual member of the team responsible for the entire operation, as even the slightest slip up could mean the failure of the gambit. A couple close calls were made, perhaps the closest being when one of the bosses had gotten careless with a secretary at lunch and had spilled the beans. It took a new wardrobe, an all expense paid trip to New York, and a bonus to her elderly father's pension for her to agree to keep quiet on it. \n\nFinally, after much hard work, it became time to step up to the plate. In a shock media announcement, Il Duce made it clear that in an unprecedented move, he had amended the constitution to strip the royal court of all direct ability to influence policy. Within minutes, the Bosses' work came into effect. Local challenges to the change were strangled in the crib before they could get off the ground, embarrassing media challenges were silenced, and protests were kept at a minimum. When it was all over, they drank a toast to themselves and a job well done."

scorzaseventies.9.t:0 "Sogno's Disappearance" # Sogno disappears, Umberto is waiting around, very scary situation
scorzaseventies.9.d:0 "At around 10 in the morning, it was first discovered that Edgardo Sogno, well known royalist and military general, had gone missing. By 10:20, the news had reached the office of Il Duce, setting off a frantic series of searches and phone calls to members of the military brass across the country. By 10:45, the news had reached the now isolated royal court, catching the already irritated and gravely suspicious King off guard. By 10:58 his son, having received an urgent call from the man, arrived to find him lying on his side on a sofa. Initially panicked by it, it took until 11:02 for his father to calm him down enough for the two to talk. This is the conversation they had, as later testified by them: \n\nUmberto II (U): \"Thank you for coming as I requested my son, I'm not sure I could face the coming trials without you.\" \nPrince Vittorio Emanuele (VE) \"Please father, it was nothing. What is it that you need from me? I can not lie to you, I have been very concerned of your health recently.\" \nU: \"My Son... you are truly loyal to me and your country, far more than I could ever have expected. It is my great shame to admit to you that I have lied to you and deceived you. The letter you showed me several weeks ago, addressed to that General? I sent that to General Sogno, to discuss taking action against Scorza-\" \nVE: \"Father, you should have told me!\" \nU: \"And for that I am sorry, I should have trusted you then as I do now. I have been informed that the General has now gone missing, and I do not truly know if that is a good or ill omen for us. A great battle is approaching within this country, and I truly do not know if it is even possible for us to win. I am truly sorry my son, I should have done more...\""

scorzaseventies.10.t:0 "A Mystery Unanswered" # sogno is declared missing, Scorza wins, Umberto is worried as all hell (mutually exclusive)
scorzaseventies.10.d:0 "By the dawn of the next day, it had become obvious to the King and his Son that whatever had happened to General Sogno, it was almost impossible to imagine it had been anything pleasant. Despite this, for several more days they still held out hope, waiting on the off chance that their worst fears would be proven wrong. Eventually, even they had to face the truth, as many other Italian conservatives, anti-Scorza fascists, and other dissenters would: no one was coming to their rescue. With a dejected sigh, the Crown Prince drove home from his father's residence, a lingering dread in the back of his throat. \n\nFor several decades after the fact, the Sogno Incident as it would come to be called remained an intensely debated topic for not just the usual conspiracy theorists and crackpots, but for many mainstream academics as well. Some would come to claim that the obvious explanation was the best one: Scorza had simply found out about the man's plan and arranged for him to disappear into one of the regime's many black holes in Africa and the Balkans. Another favorite explanation would come to be called the Brazil theory, claiming that Sogno had, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, simply fled to South America to live out in peace there away from the power games being played in Rome. Still, even more wild explanations would come to be offered as well, claiming things as wild as a Burgundian connection, a plan by the Japanese Kenpeitai, the involvement of New York Mafia Dons, and at the very fringes of the movement, alien abduction. It remains impossible to say what truly happened, but the fact remains that for the dissenters against the Fascist orthodoxy enforced by Scorza in Italy at the time, Sogno's disappearance simply became one more addition to a long list of disappointments."

scorzaseventies.11.t:0 "The Answer Revealed" # sogno returns and removes Scorza! Monarchy is based!! Umberto is happy for a return, perhaps now his democratic plans can be fulfilled  (mutually exclusive)
scorzaseventies.11.d:0 "By the dawn of the next day, it had become obvious to the King and his Son that whatever had happened to General Sogno, it was almost impossible to imagine it had been anything pleasant. Despite this, for several more days they still held out hope, waiting on the off chance that their worst fears would be proven wrong. They were at the end of their wits when the garrison in Rome rebelled alongside several others across the country. The Golpe Sogno as it would come to be called surprised nearly everyone across the political spectrum, the King who requested it most of all. Scorza and his allies attempted to fight it off with everything they had, to the point of even calling on the students to rise up and fight for them in the streets but ultimately, with the army rallied behind him, Sogno's success was inevitable. \n\nIt was as a triumphant hero that Sogno was received by the King at his residence, a virtual army of bureaucrats, aides, and guards accompanying him to the meeting. The two sat together in the king's parlor as reporter after reporter snapped photos of the two together for papers across the globe. As it slowly began to calm down, the King turned his head and spoke to the General. \"So General, what is the next item on your agenda?\" \n\nThe general looked back at him, a hint of surprise in his face as he smiled. \"You don't seem to understand the situation, your majesty. I am just a general but you are the very king of this nation. The question isn't what are my orders for you, the question is what are your orders for us?\" \n\nAs he listened to the man speak and the sounds of protesters in the distance, a frown began to form on Umberto's face."

scorzaseventies.12.t:0 "The Party's Greatest Triumph" # Scorza removes the king, Italy is no longer a monarchy! The Italian Social Republic has been established!
scorzaseventies.12.d:0 "The elevator slowly descended down to the first floor, several guards standing within it along with Il Duce, their faces steely and their weapons prepared as always. Scorza himself stood behind them, his face and hands wrinkled and saggy with age, but his uniform and eyes as bright and burning as always. The entire elevator was, to put it simply, at a loss for words with everything that had transpired in the hours prior to the ride. On the side of the elevator, a speaker chimed in to announce that it was 5 in the afternoon, and before it had even moved on to its next announcement, Scorza's mind had begun to wander to everything that happened. \n\nIt started at the beginning of the day, the big announcement and press conference where they had announced the long suspected final step in his plans for fascism. Evidence had been found, he claimed, proving the King and certain members of the general staff had been in cahoots for a plan to forcibly remove the legitimate government from power and institute a policy of slavish obedience to the Germans. It was clear then, he continued, that Italy could not prosper under such circumstances, that something had to be done. He paused then for dramatic effect before dropping the long expected bombshell. \"The Italian monarchy, a reactionary and anti-fascist institution, must go!\" \n\nThe news had polarized Italy like he had expected, and it had taken every previous precaution taken to ensure no mass upheaval would occur. For some time he had felt the very tension in the air itself, constantly wrapping itself around him and his allies and squeezing them for dear life. It was just when he was about to lose hope that the good news had come to him: the King and the royal family had boarded a plane and left for Washington. \n\nThe breaking of that news had finally cut the tension, and with a triumphant look, he had greeted the crowds from the same balcony Mussolini had stood on all those years ago to announce the creation of a new nation: the Italian Social Republic. As the crowds roared with approval and patriotism, he knew that somewhere out there, his predecessors in the party were looking down on him with pride in their eyes. \n\nAs the elevator finally reached its destination, he reached up and wiped a single tear from his cheek. He was an old man now with not much time left, that much was obvious, but he had accomplished everything he set out to do. Fascism had won its victory over Italy itself."

scorzaseventies.13.d:0 "He sat alone in his office, a small glass of wine and ashtray his only accompaniment for the dreary hours of the early morning. Despite the great triumph he had overseen with the creation of the Republic, Scorza hadn't had a good nights sleep since, an unknown feeling weighing on his mind. As he moved to pour himself another drink, a gust of wind shook his window, turning his attention towards it. \n\nWalking over to the window, he made sure to secure it, while at the same time, he gazed out at the landscape of sleeping Rome. The streets were mostly empty, the houses dark, and the markets silent. Only an old man and his dog walked the streets at this hour, the man's face and hands weary but his clear love for the dog obvious. As Scorza watched the man, he felt a strong desire rising up within him, a will that he and the man could switch positions. He had accomplished so much in his tenure, he was sure of that, but in this moment he was just an old man, one who's youth had long faded away. He closed his eyes to break his gaze at the old man, but the idea refused to go away. \n\nWhen he returned to his desk, he opened a drawer and took out a sheet of stationary and a pen. Part of him screamed for him to stop, to turn back and face the power and wealth surely ahead of him, yet even more told him to finish what he had begun. The party had been hinting at it for years, and he had resisted them. Now, he was not so sure if he would. \n\nWith lingering doubt, Scorza began to write his letter of resignation."

scorzaseventies.14.d:0 "Just because the OVRA was set up to investigate anti-fascist activities, does not mean they should be restricted to hunting partisans. After all, just as there is the enemy without, we know that there is an enemy within. The would-be reformers of Italian Fascism, no matter how much they claim to love their country, are a threat to national stability. Their whispers of change and promises of everything to everyone can be as destabilising as any number of car bombs planted to sow terror. Enough!

Yet even as the party higher-ups and the rank and file alike pledge eternal loyalty to Carlo Scorza, we can not run any risk. It was less than a decade ago that Ciano stuffed the party with his reformers, and if the worst offenders have since been displaced, we must act now to ensure the instability plaguing Italian minds does not enter the party as well. There shall be no ideological divergence, no doubt within the Partito Nazionale Fascista.

There will be no complacency. If we must impose martial law, then the Army will be ready, and if it comes time to bash in the chests of their kinsmen, the Army shall carry out the order.

In the pulpits of the most prominent churches in the country, those of our friends among the servants of God will tell their flock of the importance of humility and subservience to Caesar. Instability, insurrection and disorder are not merely the actions of sinful men - they serve the Prince of Darkness himself, and the partisans act as the perverted lapdogs of the enemy of Christ. These words will do much to give faithful men with an axe to grind pause. If they will not submit out of love to the Duce or to Fascism, then maybe they will submit at least to the fear of God and their desire to serve Him."

Yet nothing could be further from reality, and Carlo Scorza will prove them wrong. Not only are Fascism and Christianity compatible - we must emphasise to all Italians that Italy is a Christian country, that the ties between the State and the Church are important and unbreakable, and that much of Fascism's strength is derived from its work to further the glory of God. Italians must also know that the Duce is a God-fearing man, and whatever demonstrations must be staged to show this, then they will go ahead.

In rallying behind the King, Duce Scorza will demonstrate his loyalty to the unchanging sources of power and wealth in the country. This should do much to reassure not only the King's traditional allies among the landowners and the industrialists, but also the Government and the civil service itself. For if Carlo Scorza is committed in full to the cause represented by the King, then how could he be expected to do harm to Italy? And how could any member of government, any wealthy or powerful person who guides her affairs, act against the Duce without also acting against the King himself?"

scorzaseventies.21.d:0 "There is no need to beat around the bush. The Italian civilisation is the greatest one that the world has ever known, and the Italian people the fullest and most genuine expression of the potential of the human race. No one has ever cast doubt on the nationalist credentials of Italian Fascism, but now Scorza must turn to the people themselves and call on their support as brothers and sisters of the same Nation. He must remind them, as they sometimes forget, that Italian dominance is the basis of everything they hold dear; that the appeal to pride in Italy is no mere trick, but the fullest expression of their deepest desires; that without Italy and without the Italian Nation they are nothing. If Scorza must speak for hours on the subject until this is drilled into Italians' heads, then he will do so."

scorzaseventies.22.t:0 "The Anti-Fascists Have Tanks" # Antifascists have fucking tanks, Italy reenters low stability (FINAL EVENT FOR SCORZA GAMEPLAY IN RELEASE 1)
scorzaseventies.22.d:0 ""They have tanks, Duce." Extensive shelling and street fighting in the province of Cosenza, Calabria, where Scorza himself was born, have shattered the defences of the local Fascist garrison. Elsewhere, reports from a village in the North describe partisans with assault rifles, and threats that the entire village will be destroyed unless it provides food and equipment to the anti-fascists. \n\n The worst fear of the authorities, from the intelligence services to the soldiers, has been realised. Already commerce grinds to a halt in the worst affected regions, and there are entire chunks of the Italian mainland where the security of our forces cannot be accounted for. Despite Carlo Scorza's promises, he has failed to ensure stability and peace. For if the anti-fascists have tanks, God knows what else they possess at their disposal, and how far they will go to achieve the destruction of Fascism in Italy. For the honest breadwinners amongst our population, who spend their energy everyday to earn a better life for their children, the worst thing is not knowing. Not knowing what tomorrow brings, not knowing how long the economy will continue to function, not knowing who will rule them the day after tomorrow. The Government will spill as much blood as is necessary to put down the partisans. But whilst the blood pools quietly in street corners..."
scorzaseventies.22.a:0 "...Italy slips once more into instability."

nscorza.3.t:0 "The Second Verona Conference" # The Second Verona Conference, fascism is a weird, undefined thing, Scorza is to drive Italy to success so he should call yet another conference to decide what direction his reign will go (DONE)
nscorza.3.d:0 "Across Italy, the newsreels were putting out the word en masse. Every paperboy made more than enough change by the day. Duce Scorza proclaimed the time had come to congregate at Verona once again, to finally decide just how to bring Italy back to the glory it so rightfully deserves. Already, politicians and government officials are reaching the Agide by plane, boat and rail much like they had done not so long ago. News teams are sent and arrive long before any delegations do, and the whole of Italy sits in waiting to see in what way Scorza shall lead them.\n\nFascism has always been a fickle thing, and there is no doubt it needs defining. Fears have been gathering regarding exactly what will happen at the conference, as tensions were so high in the last. But currently, attitudes are high and expectations are lofty. Scorza will lead Italy to it's predestined place as hegemon of the Mediterranean, one way or another!"
nscorza.3.a:0 "Alla vittoria!"

nscorza.4.t:0 "The Roots of the Tree"
nscorza.4.d:0 "Fascism has some of its earliest roots buried in the ways of Sansepolcroismo, perhaps the original building blocks of Mussolini's fascismo constructed during the early 20's. While it may be seen by some unenlightened members of government as ludicrously out of date, Duce Scorza has proclaimed that Italy shall look upon the original teachings of Mussolini to find guidance during such troubling times, to wash away the detritus and corruption of decades of straying from the party baseline.\n\nThe founding words of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento shall be read over and revered as the teachings of Mussolini in their purest and uncorrupted form. Italy will return to the way it was always meant to be, and through it, be better! And yet, some still hate these actions, seeing them as running back around in a circle instead of moving forward. Only time can tell if fascism can still hold through."
nscorza.4.a:0 "Sometimes, old is better."

nscorza.5.t:0 "Back in Fiume" # Fiume is where D'annunzio first took stage making fascism known, a thoughtful return there will show the peoples of italy the rich history our nation has in ideology alone (DONE)
nscorza.5.d:0 "Fiume is regarded as the cradle of fascism, the first testing ground of such theories. Propagated by Gabrielle D'Annunzio, widely known as the John the Baptist of Fascism. It is because of this, Scorza has made a visit to the old city on which the Adriatic once sat. Showcasing to the Italian people the rich history their nation has in its ideology alone, it has reinvigorated a sense of national pride amongst a percentage of them.\n\nOf course though, some groups that would see Scorza fall detest this as a poor propagandist effort that fell flat on its face, and with their words they carry support. Scorza has decried this as unwarranted hate on the "righteous path" he is bringing Italy on, yet it still brings up the question as to what he is really doing."
nscorza.5.a:0 "Through our past, we may find our future."

nscorza.6.t:0 "Minds to Fill" # Mandating education in fascist literature will make sure that the youth will not go astray from the ideology (DONE)
nscorza.6.d:0 "The youth is our future, and never have such words been so true. Despite a period of time where thoughts of removing fascism classes existed, they have now been entirely reinstated indefinitely by decree of Scorza. Fascist literature such as La dottrina de fascismo, by none other than Duce Mussolini, is being taught for hour long classes on a daily basis, hammering home the ideology into the heads of Italy's impressionable children.\n\nOther factions have detested this as entirely unnecessary, pandering to children who cannot yet think for themselves, and as the extraneous extension of the school day. Scorza, like he has many times before, pushed off their words as nothing but "idiotic attempts to stop Italy's march to glory". How well these classes are working to the benefit of the government is yet to be seen, but it is doubtless some effect will come of it."
nscorza.6.a:0 "Get them started young."

nscorza.7.t:0 "Respect your Elders!" # The PNF is best lead by the old school, the youth will dabble far too much in new ideas while the the elders know what works (DONE)
nscorza.7.d:0 "The PNF has been in the control of the same people who were indoctrinated during the March on Rome for almost 40 years now, and it is best kept that way. The youth of the party, believed to be too revolutionary, have been purposely and covertly kept away from attaining any upper positions in the political hierarchy so that the status quo may be maintained. Frustration and confusion now rule the lower party, but they are all but unbeknownst to the true reasons as to why they cannot achieve what they want.\n\nThe upper party has become gratuitous for Scorza's actions, and not only will the PNF remain in its old ways, but it will also be more loyal to the state and the government it services. An unbridled success for Scorza's party line, and his enemies know nothing of it!"
nscorza.7.a:0 "The old know best."

nscorza.8.t:0 "Past Glories" # The youth today do not know of Mussoloni's struggle, he brought italy to glory! (DONE)
nscorza.8.d:0 "In every classroom across Italy, a new book was in play. "The Struggles of Duce Mussolini" read on the cover of the chronicle which was held in every young Italian's hands. Mussolini's rise to power and the development of fascism was meticulously detailed by Scorza's scholars, meant to show the youth the glories of the "greatest leader Italy has had", as said on page four.\n\nThe effect of the new literature course has been varied, yet this is not the only measure being conducted. Posters, pamphlets and announcements help to wedge in the idea into the minds of Italy's children. The legacy of Mussolini will be remembered, no, must be remembered, for better or worse."
nscorza.8.a:0 "What is fascism if not Mussolini's idea?"

nscorza.9.t:0 "Sycophant Incarnate" # If the people aren't to listen, perhaps they'll be persuaded by the crowd, we'll engage in using yesmen and Sycophants to better our look (DONE)
nscorza.9.d:0 "Despite Duce Scorza's many, many efforts to persuade the Italian people into following fascism once more, success has been less than expected, suffice to say. Because of this, strings have been pulled to try and stir up discussion amongst the public crowd. Yesmen and yuppies have been selected and posted to positions of prominence amongst the lower class, to try and softly persuade them into the doctrine of fascism that they had followed closely decades before.\n\nAnd yet, people will still try to believe what they want to believe. No matter how many are pulled into the fold, it appears that there are always dissenters remaining. Frustration is beginning to rule in government."
nscorza.9.a:0 "Nobody listens."

nscorza.10.t:0 "Praeteritum et virtutibus" # Classic Rome, a staple to what was once an empire to today, a lesser empire. Though we sit comfortable with our standing in the world, using Rome as an example will allow others to look at what can be regarding our nation, a great future. (DONE)
nscorza.10.d:0 "Italy's past is held in the glory of Rome, a testament to the power that was once wielded over Europe, and as a whole the world. And now, Italy has forged for herself a new empire with new glory. Yet, this is not enough. Propaganda efforts have been made across the entire Italian domain to use classical Rome as an example to what Italy is today, as well as something to strive towards. As Duce Scorza put in an announcement earlier this week, "Rome may be dead, but her legacy is eternal. Let us secure this legacy as ours, once and for all!"\n\nComparisons have been drawn to every faucet of Italy's power projection. Infantry divisions marching through the sands of Africa to legions treading in the forests of Germania. Proud battleships sailing throughout what remains of the Mediterranean to triremes doing battle with Carthage. In general, the public have adored these contrasts and a renewed interest has been found in Roman history and the wellbeing of Italy's empire as a whole. Truly, if Rome is not eternal in reality, then it will be in legacy."
nscorza.10.a:0 "Roma invicta."

nscorza.11.t:0 "The Volunteer Militia" # The blackshirts have started to become more preferable to the army. Good. The army is left with loyalties to the king who wished to see italy further corrupted with degenerous democracy. The MSVN know their calling: fascism. (DONE)
nscorza.11.d:0 "The Blackshirts have always held the most loyalty to the PNF and Il Duce, never straying away from partylines, never disobeying orders. In sharp contrast, the Regio Esercito has time and time again turned away from the powers in Rome in favour of supposedly democratic politicians like the traitor Ciano, or the King who wishes to see his own nation corrupted. These being the thoughts of Scorza have inevitably led to the MSVN, or Blackshirts, being favored heavily for conducting operations within and without Italy, becoming a sort of second army in their own right. After all, what better to exercise the will of the state than a tool of the party?"
nscorza.11.a:0 "The most loyal is the most effective."

nscorza.12.t:0 "Uncooperative Associates" # The congress in Verona held against Scorza's wishes was a terrible move, however, we must show our regime is willing to work with dissenters. Behind closed doors Scorza personally talks with those who pushed for another Verona, and just like that, they suddenly all agree! No one knows what went on in the meeting. (DONE)
nscorza.12.d:0 "The Verona Conference was a disaster held against Scorza's wishes, plagued by dissent and anarchy. However, the government must cooperate with the rejectionists to keep operations running smoothly. Scorza has convened everyone who pushed for a second Verona, and they all have suddenly agreed to his plans. Nobody but the men present behind those locked doors knows what went on during it, but at least plans can be put into motion now."
nscorza.12.a:0 "Suspicious."

nscorza.13.t:0 "Helpfully Misplaced" # The Carabinieri might have loyalties to the king, however this works out for us, sending in the Carabinieri will allow for a bloodless cleaning of the failed 2nd Verona Conference (DONE)
nscorza.13.d:0 ""The Carabinieri serve officially as the gendarmerie of the Kingdom of Italy, or military police. As a result, they hold most of their loyalties towards the monarchy and reformist factions, but this is currently acceptable. A detachment of these men will be sent into Verona to suppress protests and cover up the failed Second Verona Conference, and best of all, without any bloodshed! Duce Scorza clearly knows how to play these factions against each other."
nscorza.13.a:0 "All to plan."

nscorza.14.t:0 "A State of Panic" # Scirza declares a national emergency, somewhat of an overreaction, but there are traitors within the PNF that threaten the stability of italy. They are to be dealt with. (DONE)
nscorza.14.d:0 "Once again, Italy was in a present state of extremity and panic, something the nation had become used to by now. However, this time, there wasn't much to actually panic about. Scorza has declared a state of emergency country-wide due to recent protests at Verona and political failures currently ongoing, which is seen primarily as an overreaction. Many say there is a deeper level to this decision however, an attempt to take administrative action and root out dissenters within the PNF itself. Of course, anybody who says this mysteriously disappears by the next morning, but it is probably nothing to worry about."
nscorza.14.a:0 "Entirely necessary!"

nscorza.15.t:0 "Bloody Hands" # Verona is cleansed. Blood on the regimes hands this early only shows that they have the guts to do what Ciano couldn't. Italy's road to redemption has started, and Scorza will pave the way to make the ride smooth. (DONE)
nscorza.15.d:0 "Screams rang out across the courtyard for hours after the carnage ended. Friends and family clutched their dying loved ones as the fires were stoked even higher, crowds being beaten and forced to scurry away as bodies were trampled over. It seems the Carabinieri have gone far from our expectations. Damage control and information suppression is now in effect.\n\nScorza and his administration has declared that 4 protesters have been killed in riot control at Verona by military police. Instead of decrying these actions, they have instead declared blood on their hands this early is simply indicative of their willpower to see Italy's destiny through, unlike Ciano. People are outraged, but it is doubtless Verona is cleansed. Scorza has shown he means business."
nscorza.15.a:0 "All for the greater good."

nscorza.16.t:0 "Paint the Town Red" # The army is sent in to deal with Verona dissenters, they get kind of fucked up, more people in verona die (keep death toll low, like 8 max, possibly lower) but the army failed their mission, make the title vague dont have it be like "failure at verona" (DONE)
nscorza.16.d:0 "Verona was beginning to become a town stained with blood, chaos and death. Protests and riots have begun to spill over into the surrounding countryside like a deluge of violence. Inevitably, more soldiers are required to contain the situation, but today it proved too much. A detachment of the 4th Infantry Division Livorno was overrun by an onslaught of rioters after a brutal melee battle, resulting in even more deaths. The army was forced to retreat to the city outskirts and lick its wounds as the riots devolved into somewhat of a siege. 3 infantrymen and 5 rioters have been reported dead, bringing the grand total of dead to 12. The actions being conducted at the city have become notorious throughout the world, and by connection, so has the Scorza administration for its brutality. Instability has begun to take hold, but Scorza's iron rule will keep things in check for now."
nscorza.16.a:0 "Ready for battle!"

nscorza.17.t:0 "Nothing Happened" # Nothing occurred in Verona, there were some dissenters, but through Duce Scorza's wise words it was resolved. There was no military intervention, there were no traitors. Scorza is saving the Italian regime.
nscorza.17.d:0 "A campaign of disinformation, disorientation and confusion is treading Italy. The disastrous events which occurred at Verona are now being erased from history and memory. No books or records are allowed to contain even a shred of information about the city's recent history. Those publicly speaking about it suddenly shut up the next day, or are never found again. Bribes and threats, back alley deals and murders. Everything is being done to stop the flood of information, every track covered by the OVRA and paper trails leading to dead ends.\n\nThose who remember the chaos of those short few weeks keep it to themselves, or face the brunt force of Scorza's regime. Slowly and surely people will forget and a new story will be written. There was no intervention, there were no riots. Scorza is Italy's leader, he will lead it to victory!"
nscorza.17.a:0 "The truth is a threat."

nscorza.1400.t:0 "Onto Business" # Scorza has worked out the council (be vague, event fires no matter the outcome), now it is time to move on to the many questions the new administration faces: economic, social status, domestic issues, global issues, european influence, etc. (DONE)
nscorza.1400.d:0 "After a tenuous few months, Scorza has finally worked out his council on the path he has designed for Italy. The administration will bend and obey his every order and command at a whim. With an obedient government, Scorza has turned his eyes onto the problems strangling Italy at the moment. The shambles of an economy which barely crawls along, bruised and beaten by the horrors of Atlantropa. The many social issues that plague the everyday lives of Italy's sons and daughters, women's rights, minority recognition, and much more.\n\nDomestic problems, political and not. Divides which tear apart at the very fabric of the Italian nation and consciousness. Italy's prominence on the world stage, her empire and influence. And, of course, the issue that is the European continent. The hungry wolf of Germany baring its teeth to her north, a reckless and delinquent Balkan peninsula to her east, treacherous and backstabbing "allies" challenging her dominance of the Mediterranean. Italy surely has many problems, but Scorza shall see her through them, one way or another."
nscorza.1400.a:0 "Bring us to victory!"

nscorza.18.t:0 "Man's Partner" # The question of women's role in society, some opt to rebrand for a better look of italians overall, some opt for maintaining the patriarchy (DONE)
nscorza.18.d:0 "Women comprise half of the entire population of Italy, yet have always been placed on the sidelines of any administrative action. Given leeway whenever convenient, like the suffragette movement. Fascism has always put them in the place of housewives, child bearers, homemakers, whatever else to disadvantage them. But Duce Scorza sees the issue inherent within this form of thought. For Italy to function as a united nation, its population must share control amongst themselves, equal opportunities so everyone may bring Italy to her full potential.\n\nUnfortunately, and inevitably however, there are those who disagree. Those who wish to maintain the patriarchy which Mussolini held up. Scorza will go along with either, it is simply a matter of deciding once and for all what role women will play in society. One option will upset the other, as always."
nscorza.18.a:0 "Women, can't live with them, can't live without them!"

nscorza.19.t:0 "The Idol of Desire" #  The Female Face of Fascism, hard to find one, there's debate over who it should be, yet theres not really a notable female fascist figure within italy that people can agree on. (DONE)
nscorza.19.d:0 "There have been new social endeavors to bring women to the forefront of society and national administration, but one problem remains. Fascism has always been built around the prominence of a single figure in the middle, and in this situation it is no different. To propagate the further empowerment of women within Italy, there must be a leader of their movement, a female face of fascism, as some have said.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that there is no real person to fill this role. While there are of course female figures that have spearheaded certain divisions or individual movements, there is not yet one that can be agreed upon to lead the entirety of "feminist fascism". This problem must be rectified quickly lest any momentum built up thus far be lost."
nscorza.19.a:0 "If not strongman, is it strongwoman?"

nscorza.20.t:0 "In Kitchens, Not Offices!" #  Fascism Feminism is made up, it isnt real. The patriarchy will stay. (DONE)
nscorza.20.d:0 "Recent endeavors to empower women within Italy have ultimately fallen flat on its face in favour of the patriarchal status quo. Shortcomings, mishaps and a lack of public support have seen the movement stopped in its tracks by the powers in place and their wide conservative support base. The idea that the entirety of "feminist fascism" is infact made up and never had any bearings in reality has been pushed to every informative faucet in the nation.\n\nThose that still remain on the sinking ship bicker and fight as leaders jump and funding moves away, specifically Carlo Scorza and his administration, who have conceded and moved to support the patriarchy. It seems the dream of equality will remain that, a dream."
nscorza.20.a:0 "What a stupid idea, anyway."

nscorza.25.t:0 "The New Face of Fascism!" #  The everyday female is the face of fascism! Every day is a fight but the italian woman stands strong." Based "fascism. (DONE)
nscorza.25.d:0 "Few think progressive when they hear the word fascism, let alone when they hear the name Carlo Scorza. Yet, expectations have been blown aside once again. New propaganda posters and brochures have been printed and posted into every major city throughout Italy. All are attempts to push the new and successful feminist rhetoric which has dominated the Italian social and political atmosphere for weeks on end.\n\nThese words speak of the Italian woman, brave in the face of everyday challenges and the patriarchy, pushing forwards to bring glory to Italy. "The new face of fascism" have become words famous, the catchphrase of the feminist movement. Few ever expected the women's rights movement to pick up traction in an ideology so far right as fascism, and yet here we are. Beyond the obvious propaganda benefits of this, this also opens the door for interesting military and economic avenues not possible before. Perhaps, eventually, women could march alongside men on the battlefield or work hand in hand on the factory floor. A whole new world has opened up, all thanks to Duce Scorza!"
nscorza.25.a:0 "That was unexpected."

nscorza.26.t:0 "The Modern Housewife" #  Women are meant to answer to their husbands or be trained to do so. (DONE)
nscorza.26.d:0 "The history of the dynamic between man and woman has, for the most part, always been one of dominance and subservience. Husband and wife. There have been concessions when necessary to keep up war industry or the smooth pace of society, yet things have always stayed relatively the same. Recent developments have attempted to change that, with support unseen before in modern history. But still, it has all failed. The patriarchy remains in place, and will for much longer to go.\n\nBecause the patriarchy remains, so must its ideas. The wife is meant to obey the husband, as such has been the way for centuries, and so must be the way it is. Public announcements, propaganda and demonstrations speak these words, demanding the train of progressive change be stopped, and so it has. Been blown off the track, it seems. The wife will stay home and tend to the familial unit, and the husband will work his job to provide for the family. It mustn't change."
nscorza.26.a:0 "Some things stay the same."


nscorza.31.t:0 "Teachings of the Past" #  The great men of the past are the elders of today, protests of those trying to avoid their teachings are to be clamped down upon. (DONE)
nscorza.31.d:0 "Italy is the way it is today because of the actions of men since dead or driven to old age. Now a proud eagle spread across her rightful domain of the Mediterranean, without them she would've stayed an irrelevant continental power playing second fiddle to Britain, France and Germany. There are those however that have strayed from the light present within the teachings of these men, the detritus of decades of decadence taking a toll on the psyche of the Italian population.\n\nThose that would wish to see all Italy has been built upon, all that was striven for in the Great Wars destroyed shall be silenced and buried as they deserve. Soldiers will parade through the streets, stamping down on protest. Tanks will roll in grand columns, crushing dissent beneath their mighty tracks. Disrespect towards the modern founding fathers of Italy, and as a whole the nation, will receive no tolerance."
nscorza.31.a:0 "Patriotism is not optional."

nscorza.33.t:0 "The Ways of the Future" # the future is decided by the minds of today. we must listen to the youth and their thoughts on reforming fascims (DONE)
nscorza.33.d:0 "The youth of the nation will inevitably rise to lead it, and with it come their ideas. The old guard cannot stay in power for eternity, and succession must be aligned before all is too late. The youth of the party hold many thoughts on how to better fascism to fit the modern reality, and as a whole ready Italy for the challenges ahead of her. Theirs is a noble cause, and one we have ignored for too long.\n\nOld and tired leaders shall be replaced by those more keen and fit. The minds of today will power the engines which drive forward administration and keep things on track. Failing theories will be buried and in their place those prepared for the modern day. The legacy of the past must be kept sacred and remembered, but decrepit fossils cannot manage a young state."
nscorza.33.a:0 "Out with the old, in with the young."

nscorza.34.t:0 "If It Ain't Broke"
nscorza.34.d:0 "Italy is great, and always has been. The same practices which were born after the slaughter of the First Great War saw Italy through the uncertainty of the interwar period, and claimed for her an empire of gold in the Second Great War. These practices have kept Italy the way it is for decades on end and show no discernible signs of failure. Those reckless younglings that would see Mussolini's legacy torn asunder in favor of untested, untrue theories mustn't be allowed anywhere near an administrative office.\n\nThe men who run the PNF shook hands with Mussolini, were the ones that forged fascism in the flames of the March on Rome. They were the ones that sent brave men to fight and die in the hills of Greece, the plains of Yugoslavia and the sands of Egypt. They, and they alone, know how to run Italy, and how fascism is intended to be. Notions of reform and change are overrated and childish. The current course will be stayed and bring us through this storm, as it had many before."
nscorza.34.a:0 "Why fix it?"

nscorza.35.t:0 "The Man in the Vatican" # the vatican is not a fan of our fascist policy, we must work out a way on how to deal with them (DONE)
nscorza.35.d:0 "Scorza's administration and fascism as a whole has deep rooted support within the Catholic Christian population base of Italy, but much of this support is based around a single man, a single city.\n\nThe Pope, the ruler of the Vatican City, has always held a distaste for the authoritarian tendencies of fascism and as a result his beliefs have spread throughout Christianity. Whatever the Pope says is liable to be followed in close stride by all of Christendom, and Italy is no different.\n\nOf course, the Pope cannot simply be assassinated and it be covered up as a fall down the stairs. We must convene a meeting of the minds and figure out a method to deal with him. Perhaps it's time to finally finish 1870. Maybe not."
nscorza.35.a:0 "Those siege walls can't stand up to bombers!"

nscorza.36.t:0 "A Crumbling City" # we shall not bend to the church. we must move our population away from the thoughts of the petty city of the vatican (DONE)
nscorza.36.d:0 "The Vatican is always working in the benefit of the Pope. Never professing the truth or working for the Italian people, or Christendom itself. The Pope is a liar, cheat and most importantly a scam artist! Him and his city cannot be trusted, not by Rome and not by Italy.\n\nSuch were the words of Scorza as he made a public address earlier this morning. Years of building tensions between the Vatican and the Italian administration have finally come to a head as Rome has severed most ties with the Holy See and declared the Pope untrustworthy. All of this comes from a fresh campaign to pull apart Italian Christianity and the Pope in light of the realization that the Pope wields much influence over the population, and any hateful rhetoric directed towards fascism will inevitably wash over the people of Italy.\n\nA campaign like this is audaciously ambitious at best, but Scorza and his administration remain confident they can pull off such a monumental societal transformation."
nscorza.36.a:0 "The Pope and Christianity are one and the same!"

nscorza.37.t:0 "The Concordat" # fascism only got this far due to the concordat. we shall review it and see where to go from here (DONE)
nscorza.37.d:0 "The relationship between Italy and the Vatican is one born in the short but chaotic War of 1870, which finalized the unification of the Italian peninsula. The Pope, once upon a time presiding over central Italy, is now limited to the Vatican City, in reality a "state" the size of a palace. Hiding behind the city's massive stone walls until 1929, the Pope eventually conceded to signing a deal and maintaining the stability of the church.\n\nThe Lateran Treaty, better known as the Concordat was created in Rome and finalized the borders between the Papal State and the Kingdom of Italy. Since the rise of fascism, a tense but amicable existence has continued to exist until now. Scorza's attempts at pushing at the Pope have brought things to a breaking point. It is decidedly so then that the Concordat shall be reviewed and the next few decisions taken based upon that. The Papal relationship must be preserved, for the wellbeing of Christianity as a whole."
nscorza.37.a:0 "The church is nothing without the Pope."

nscorza.38.t:0 "A Nation of Many Faces" # Secularism is important, religion divides us all, we're all italian, not all of us are catholic though (DONE)
nscorza.38.d:0 "Italy, as it stands now, is a very diverse nation in every way imaginable. Arab Muslims buy from Italian Christians in bustling street markets. Agnostics marry devout theists, Chinese traditionalists converse with Alpine pagans! Italy is a nation that holds many different beliefs, many different ethnicities and many different people. To consign itself to a single following would be dismissive towards the many other citizens who serve under the Italian banner.\n\nAnd so, as it is today, Italy is a secular nation by decree of Duce Scorza. A move considered radical by many more conservative elements in Italy, it will serve as an unexpected solution to the current Papal crisis. By not playing to the Pope's games of religion, Scorza will inevitably win either way! Of course though, this has placed quite a few divides within the nation, but it is hoped time will mend any differences and bring the whole country onto a brighter future. After all, we are all sons and daughters of Italy, why not act as such?"
nscorza.38.a:0 "Is this the right move?"

nscorza.39.t:0 "Servants of the Flag" # The state is whats important, everyone here is under the PNF, not everyone here is catholic (DONE)
nscorza.39.d:0 "Every one person who lives and breaths and dies in Italy has swore a silent oath to the flag, to serve the nation forever and always, till death ends their duty. The state, the nation, is the one that controls everything, not the church. Every citizen of Italy exists under the watchful eye of the PNF, not the Pope. Our policy should reflect this truth. Devout religion is a thing of the past, nationalism and service to the state is the present! The bible shall be replaced with the manifesto, the priests' robes with uniform and medals. This entire Papal charade is nothing but the death throes of an increasingly irrelevant church, one being smothered by the boot of the state.

We cannot simply wash away its grand influence over the population, or replace it with another following. It is the unfortunate truth that we must come to terms with the Pope, and find a solution beneficial to both our parties, lest more chaos be wrought from this little dispute.\n\nA meeting has been scheduled in the mountainous village of Foce between representatives of the government and the Vatican. It is expected a deal will be reached, as it was in 1929. A deal must be reached for the greater good of all Italy. We do not need to like them, and they do not need to like us. We simply need to coexist, and uphold our own dues to the Italian people. Once all of this is cleared up we may move on to greater and better matters."

nscorza.45.d:0 ""A silent bird followed just outside Scorza's view for the whole car ride from the airport. Swooping and diving under, between and beside street posts, canopies, people and cars it followed on. Not a single chirp could be heard from its beak the whole way through, but Scorza knew it was there. A black bird. One with a sharp, vantablack beak and ruffled feathers. Piercing beads sat in its eye sockets, jumping back and forth between people and objects.\n\nScorza knew what the bird was. He was never a very spiritualistic man, but he knew it was a sign. A herald. A messenger of things to come, events to follow and the path to be tread. So many things were left to be completed, and he had only begun. He would see Italy through them all, swooping and diving under, between and beside war, famine, crisis and death.\n\nAnd yet, there was a solemn feeling to it. The bird did not sing, the bird did not cry. What was it trying to tell him? Had he done everything right? Was everything truly going to be okay? He had conquered so many problems by now. The women's rights movement, the youth of the party, the church. Everything was solved by him, everything was solvable to him, unlike Ciano. But, there was still a longing for those times. When the urgency was not there, where they dined on fine wines and fat meats every night knowing the next morning would be good. When everything stood still, and just for a moment, it remained outside a blur.\n\nWhere the car screeched to a halt in front of parliament, Scorza's mind did not. Stepping from the car to the pavement, a silent brush of the air could be heard overhead. The black bird soared and flew into the sky, flapping against the breeze, desperate yet determined to go on. And over the parliament's arch did it fly, disappearing from sight. There was so much left to do, and so little time."

Failing to rise up to the horrors of Atlantropa, Italy was plunged into recession by his refusal to take action. Of course, this is just what Scorza would like people to believe. In reality, the economy began to stabilize shortly before the end of Ciano's tenure, but still it is in shambles.\n\nDuce Scorza has drawn up a plan to pick up the pieces left over by the previous administration, but it still needs review and further agreement before it is put into place. A meeting will be convened between the biggest whigs of the economy to decide just how to push Italy forward on the inevitably rocky road ahead of her."

It is no wonder the Italian economy runs at a pace so terribly slow, the men running it likely had their education in the 19th century! These old men will finally be put to their retirement and new, young and ambitious bureaucrats brought in to fill their seats.\n\nNot only the economic echelons will be receiving such swapping either, bureaus of information, police and administration will also receive some light overhauls to push for a better Italy overall.

Regardless of if they are old or prepared to drop dead from their chairs at any moment, they simply need more funds to carry out their work. Any efficient bureaucracy requires a lot of money to stay well oiled, and this is no different. More extreme funding will be transferred to administrative departments so that starving programs may finally get some cash.\n\nIf those in charge do not have the money to do what they must, all of Italy is lost to chaos. It is what makes the world go round, after all. And yet, there are those who protest these actions. They say the system must be overhauled, but their mewling shall be silenced.

nscorza.80.d:0 "The Institute of International Political Studies, or IIPS, has brought up a very important topic relevant to Italy's modern dilemma. Her standing on the world stage, the way the other powers look at her: as a strong and proud empire, or a second rate pawn. The institute itself, mostly just college kids who never figured out what they want to do, has brought forward legitimate choices.\n\nIn olden days, Italy had created a balance of relationships between foreign powers, powers which could make or break Italy's rise to prominence. The Entente and Central Powers in the First Great War, France and Britain in the interwar. The Axis and Allies in the Second, choosing definitively a side only when convenient. The situation Italy faces now is not too different, simply another balance of power between the superpowers of the world. Italy must just nudge the powers off each other to get what she wants.\n\nThere is another proposition however, one more radical. Italy does not need outside help anymore, for she is a powerful empire with domains of her own! Our foreign diplomacy should be modeled directly around what Italy wants and what Italy demands, her sphere and her influence. No more playing second fiddle, no more answering the wishes of other nations. Italy will stand on her own legs.\n\nEither option has their individual merits and inferiorities, but a choice must be made, and be made soon. The vultures are closing in around Italy, and a path must be carved to get out of the chaos to soon ensue."

At times, it can feel as though there is no real way to manage all of it from Rome. But, such thoughts must be dispelled. Italy's empire first must not be thought as overstretched for it to cease being overstretched.\n\nAs such, colonial administrations and vassal governments have been ordered to start integrating their processes with Italy so operations may be run closer and most importantly, smoother. From the towering Alps, to the ruins of Athens. From the grandeur of Rome to the most holy land. From the ancient pyramids of Giza to the sea slums of Mogadishu, the Italian eagle stretches, and proudly does so.

As such, it is only fitting for the entire empire to share the one currency. By making every nation in the Italian sphere trade the same banknotes, many of the processes which circulate money and resources throughout the empire will be much easier.

nscorza.86.d:0 "The reality of our empire and the situation it faces is that mutual cooperation is nigh-on impossible. It is Italy's empire, and as such, the colonies which reside under its banner will be exploited by it. Rocks and oil will be dug up and transferred to the Apennine peninsula for use in the corelands. If Italy was not willing to, and had not been exploiting its vassals it wouldn't have gotten to where it is today. There is no fairness in imperialism, only crown and vassal."

Despite all their attempts at being independent, the market was still in the gutters. A hasty meeting was convened between the highest members of administration and Scorza himself.\n\nThey had come to the inevitable conclusion that Italy, by nature, needed outside support to subside itself. While of course the nation is not ready to die entirely, it does not hurt to maintain a few friendly connections with the outside world. Pride and patriotism would have to be put aside just this once for the wellbeing of the economy. Scorza never wanted to look at a market report sheet again!"

itapartyunity.2.d:0 "Politics is a game of balances, of compromises, and where necessary of ruthless betrayal. Above all it is a game of unity, and of coming to an agreement with the right people so that the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The coalitions making up the Blocchi Nazionali and Fronte Democratico contain a diversity of personality and thought which may appear surprising to the uninformed outsider, who may expect a more cohesive identity to linger behind the surface. Even among groups as ideological as the BN and the FD, however, the importance of convenience and compromise remain central. A man in another country once said that a house divided against itself cannot stand, and whatever we think of the person who said it, it is hard to fault the words."

itapartyunity.3.d:0 "After De Lorenzo implemented Piano Solo, ousting the government led by the Fronte Democratico from the halls of power, it was difficult to imagine any outcome other than this. Torn by internal disagreement over what to do now, with previous ideological and personal gaps bubbling to the surface, the Fronte Democratico has collapsed under the weight of its own inflexibility. The leftist coalition's demise is a heavy blow to socialist and social democratic politics throughout Italy, and indeed much of Europe, as a leading flame of the worker's movement is snuffed out."

itapartyunity.4.d:0 "Ferocious arguments, desperate midnight conversations and open recrimination have led to the inevitable. After being ousted from power by De Lorenzo, the Blocchi Nazionali has collapsed, and with it a hope for post-fascist unity in the new order augured by the transition out of old-style fascism. Although some demagogues attempt to rally their troops, saying that the fascist ideal embodied by the BN is not yet dead, it is difficult to imagine the disparate and fiercely competitive elements making up the grouping coming back together."

itapartyunity.5.t:0 "The Fronte Democratico government dissolves" # FD collapses due to "political faults" (coalition got too lopsided and party unity busted), "a new government" will take charge, dont refer to the gov
itapartyunity.5.d:0 "After endless ideological squabbles and factional backstabbing, the Fronte Democratico coalition has proven unable to withstand the strain. The coalition is no more. A new government must now take charge of Italy's destiny, whilst the architects of the coalition's failure lick their wounds and attempt to pick up the pieces. \n\n Carried for a while through sheer stubbornness, the political press will look to interpret why the FD coalition fell at the moment it did, and what could have been done to prevent it. No doubt this will prove an interesting thought experiment for those who treat party politics as a sport. The actual consequences, on Italy's workers and businesses, will no doubt unfold in the longer term. On that front many will give their perspective, but one thing is clear. The fallout of the FD's failure will appear far beyond the claustrophobic halls of party politics."

itapartyunity.6.d:0 "Despite the impassioned appeals to national unity and calls to a higher cause made by the Blocchi's party men, the BN coalition has as of today ceased to function. The government's collapse will be answered by a new government taking charge, whilst those who failed to uphold the outgoing administration recriminate and apologise in equal measure.\n\n As the successors of the fascist legacy in democratic politics, the Blocchi Nazionale have always had a fine tightrope to walk. How harshly they will be judged for failing to hold this coalition together is for the historians. Nevertheless, the immediate consequences are clear enough. The incoming coalition will have to pull together, if not the enthusiasm, then the grudging consent of the segments of Italian society which put the BN in power (and if not, to pretend to do so). Meanwhile the Blocchi attempt to move forward, and to figure out what went wrong."

For this reason we have removed the previous project leader for the Italian nuclear programme, giving him an appropriate position to keep him quiet.

In doing this we have used every trick in the book - arguing for national interest, for doing the right thing, and for getting involved before our enemies can.

Arguments which work have been met with arguments to the contrary, and while Italian are not against our involvement in the war, they are not really in favour of it either.

scorzaoil.2.d:0 "Like the biblical Egyptians we have who endured many a rich year thanks to Il Duce's guidance. Now it falls onto them to endure a time of lean years. The Italian people must sadly tighten their belts for a time. Across Italy there is a feeling that all must make sacrifices for this trying time.

scorzaoil.3.d:0 "The Lira in freefall! Runs on the banks! Layoffs at record numbers! Every day brings a new panicked headline on the economic situation. Our national currency is teetering on the brink of total collapse, with confidence in the Lira evaporating and no man going to work in the morning sure he'll still have his job come noon. Those who can, avoid using the Lira as a medium at all costs. Even the barter system has made a dramatic comeback.\n\n This will not stand! The government and the banks must do something - anything! to save our precious Lira. Whatever the public thinks of it our sovereignty, wellbeing and very identity as a Nation depends on it!"

scorzaoil.4.d:0 "The economic crisis has been devastating. But with Duce Scorza captaining the ship we shall weather the storm, come what may. There comes to mind an old joke about two men, who find themselves trapped in a jungle with a leopard - why do you put on your boots, asks the first, you shall not outrun the beast. Yet of course the second must only outrun his fellow, not the beast. With strength and tenacity we shall be able to outrun our enemy, and when we do so this crisis will come to an end.

scorzaoil.5.d:0 "Economics is a dismal science. Sometimes to save the economy, you have to spend money where it is needed, and not where it is most desperately desired. Our decision to leave civilian matters as the last priority may appear callous. Yet in saving the economy and our vital industry first we act for all Italians. If they must starve now so that they will survive later, instead of slowly wasting away to a certain death, then this is what they will do. They will thank us in the future. Perhaps."

scorzaoil.6.d:0 "Italy's economy runs on oil. With industries ranging from petroleum companies to car manufacturers, it's safe to say that Italy's economy would grind to a halt without it. With the oil crisis grinding on the government has noticed an increasing number of pessimists complaining about the government's policies supposedly harming the Nation's long-term economic well-being\n\n While the number of pessimists is still insignificant, Il Duce still found it prudent to call a conference explaining the situations to all major companies related to the oil affair. There government officials explained that the government was dealing with the situation. That any disruption in the oil situation was expected to be temporary and that the government was already enacting its plans for the crisis. Any followup questions were, of course, met with the response that the government had the situation well in hand but that state secrets regarding military affairs in the Middle-East were, for obvious reasons, not up for disclosure. The conference ended with a series of rousing speeches imploring Italy's industries to have faith in the Party's plans for the sake of the Nation."

Until the House of Saud and its dependents in OPEN has been put down, we can forget any prospect of a stable Middle East conducive to our interests. Whilst many of the men we could corrupt are too rich to be bought, all of them have a glaring ambition, and we can perhaps use this to corrode the Saudis alliance from the inside."

scorzaoil.8.d:0 "The Iraqi Dawa Party aims to establish an Islamic state in Iraq, but several of its leaders according to our intelligence are level-headed, pragmatic men who will not throw away a small advantage if one is offered. In seeking to reduce the burden war places on us, we could establish links with the Dawa Party and offer them a ceasefire, with guarantees that we will not seek to obstruct their political mission in Iraq so long as they refrain from any and all attacks on our interest. Most of our diplomatic experts believe such a deal could be workable, yet a good number of them are skeptics. However pragmatic the Dawa leaders are, they remind us, these men view no step as too far in achieving their objectives. As such, if they see our ceasefire as an obstacle to the enactment of Islamic law in their country, they would not hesitate to betray us at our moment of greatest weakness. Having listened to the arguments, we must make our decision."

In the short and medium-term, however, they are less of a threat to our interests than the Saudis, who have the capacity to truly be kingmakers throughout the Middle East. We should make the Ba'athists an offer of peace, therefore, which will give us both breathing room and allow us to focus on the House of Saud. We can always turn around and stab them in the back down the line, when the situation is more secure."

scorzaoil.35.d:0 "Egypt is the key to the Arab world, and its single most important country. Our history there and our control of the Suez canal have demonstrated to the whole world the importance of a stabilising influence in Cairo. The oil crisis we are embroiled in now has only intensified the reasons we took control of Egypt in the first place. Now we must decide whether our resources and political will allow us to take the next logical step. Shall we formally push our claim over Egyptian rule, allowing us to become kingmakers in Egypt at this crucial juncture? Or shall we restrain ourselves and find a time which is more opportune?"

scorzaoil.37.d:0 "Gamel Abdel Nasser is an icon of the Pan-Arabist movement, and if his ideals seem like foolish dreams for now, he has proven himself a resilient player in the game of Arab politics. Worsening the situation have been attempts, reported to us by our spies in his camp, to forge a common ground with Ba'athist groups across the Arab world. To counter this we must ourselves speak to the Ba'athists and convince them to drop their links to this dangerous man, lest he becomes the leader of a general Arab renewal movement (which he openly styles himself as being). Having done this we will watch Nasser like a hawk, and remain wary as ever to the threat he represents."

For it is not enough to bury Fascism. Now we must build everyday what it means to be independent and free, and reap the benefit from opening up to all those of goodwill.

We would like to build ties with both, for the good of economic development and matters of diplomacy, but to remain autonomous in the face of such pressure will not be simple. For Japan and the US, despite their assurances of benevolence and friendship, are clear in their intent. Both see themselves as a first rate power attempting to gain influence over a second rate one.

#Ciano Democratization Events#

demitaly.40.t:0 "An Address to the Grand Council" # Ciano speaks to the grand council of fascism alongside Umberto, Umberto is clearly making Ciano speak in this manner but Ciano covers that with the results in Verona, the nation will be following a different path. Many members agree with him, notably Amintore Fanfani who has been eyeing Umberto's talking points on democracy.
demitaly.40.d:0 "Galeazzo Ciano smiled with his mouth, but not with his eyes. He had come into the chamber with King Umberto, and as the men present stood to attention Ciano paid notice to the way they addressed the monarch, bowing their head slightly as they shook his hand or making eye contact. Their respect for the King, or lack thereof, would make a big difference in their opinion of what Ciano had to say. At best, everyone present would go along with what was said, and at worst they would leave the room with reservations, which would set things back significantly. \n\nThe Duce spoke at some length, going over the talking points presented to him by the King. Democratisation would be complex and fragile, even with the systems and handover to be put in place, because to his knowledge no country had ever transitioned from Fascism to democracy. Verona had changed things for the better, Ciano said to the men present, trying to will himself to believe it. He had the full support of the King in saying this. To continue as things were before would be to risk a continuing stagnation and the dissolution of Italy's status in the world, rendering it a second rate power forever to be picked at by greater nations. Something had to give, and that something was the Fascist system designed by Mussolini for a time long past. Ciano scanned the faces of his audience. Amintore Fanfani's eyes gleamed as he listened. The man's smile was unnerving. He was not alone, and many of those present nodded solemnly. Others looked on unmoved, with faces which betrayed disappointment but not surprise. Yet no one interrupted. \n\nOnce he was finished, and had given a few curt instructions, the Duce followed King Umberto out of the room. Out of earshot of the others, the King grasped his hands in his own. "Well done," he said simply, beaming. Ciano returned the smile. Yet once more it was in his mouth, not his eyes."
demitaly.40.a:0 "Many sleepless nights to come."

demitaly.41.t:0 "The Christian Democrats Prepare" # The Christian Democrats! Seemingly the most popular party, though Ciano may wish for a more conservative party, Umberto on Ciano's side is happy to see the contenders in the upcoming election
demitaly.41.d:0 "According to our sources, the Christian Democrats are preparing for a contentious electoral campaign. Everything indicates that this coalition, a moderate grouping of centrists, democrats and conservative elements bound by an idea of Catholic politics, will win power once the election arrives. The Duce is not entirely pleased with their ideas, seeing them as too conciliatory to moderate leftist voters, but King Umberto is reportedly a firm supporter. Whether they will manage to push their advantage and implement their ideas remains to be seen."
demitaly.41.a:0 "Let's see what the favourites can do."

demitaly.42.t:0 "Meeting with the Parties" # Umberto meets with numerous factions in one day, he's tired out but still giddy about the reformation of the Italian system
demitaly.42.d:0 "Umberto II was tired, but happy. As he sat down to have something to eat - dining alone for the first time in days - he reflected on the meetings with the political factions of the past few days. \n\nAll those who came to meet him had been respectful and, with a couple of exceptions, seemed intelligent enough. The Monarchists were, as expected, almost embarrassingly earnest in their professions of undying loyalty. The Christian Democrats were particularly interesting conversation partners, genuinely soliciting his views on a number of issues and then providing their own ideas. Aldo Moro had something of a radiant quality about him, with the quiet confidence of a man who knows he is the favourite to lead his country into democracy. The socialists were more courteous than he expected, with Pietro Nenni speaking at length and then observing the King carefully for his reaction. Umberto was under no illusions as to the republicans among their ranks, but Nenni artfully steered the conversation elsewhere whenever the King raised the issue. Of Almirante, with his ties to the PNF and his known views, he did not know what to make entirely. Yet the man was charismatic, even if he was the quietest of all the politicians he had spoken with over the past days. \n\nUmberto could be proud of what he had achieved. Italy would democratise, whatever the regressive elements among the PNF had to say about it. And he would be there to see it through."
demitaly.42.a:0 "A firm hand to lead Italy to freedom."

demitaly.43.t:0 "The Democratic Front's Hopes" # The Democratic Front, some socialists who have recently had their exile lifted return to Italy, they quickly come to associate with the new block, the "fronte democratico", Pietro Nenni, a socialist who has deradicalized to be more favorable to a democratic system (he's not calling to remove the king, but he wouldn't stop others from doing it)
demitaly.43.d:0 "The left bloc is ready. For forty years they have survived on nothing but the hope of eventually abolishing Fascism and establishing a worker's government in Italy, and now that Fascism is withering away, they see this as a matter of fate. Their leader, Nenni, has moderated his socialist views to become more acceptable to the middling body of the Italian electorate. Time will tell whether this strategy will pay off, and whether the renewed hopes of the socialists, some of whom have only returned from exile recently, will bear fruit."
demitaly.43.a:0 "The workers of Italy hold their breath."

demitaly.44.t:0 "A Roundtable of Parties" # Meetings with all of the democratic leaders, they do thing alongside fascists who are worried about the complete upheaval of the system, Ciano is a mediator with sympathies to the fascists while Umberto is there on side of the democrats
demitaly.44.d:0 "Ciano rubbed the tiredness from his eyelids and looked up."If there is nothing more to add," he said. "I propose that we bring this meeting to a close. And thank you, gentlemen, for agreeing to come here on such short notice." But someone cleared his throat, and Ciano raised his head wearily. "Would you like to speak?" The person who interrupted did speak, at length, and Ciano actively stopped himself from nodding along. It was a grand old man representing the PNF interests, though not a party man himself. The democratic leaders that, at this meeting, only parties intending to run for election and civil servants of importance could attend. This had led to the awkward situation of a group of nominally independent civil servants speaking in defence of the PNF. \n\nIn any case, the PNF's man rambled on. He spoke about the threat to stability, of moving too quickly and throwing out the good of Fascism with the bad, and of letting down the hardworking members of the civil service through an imperfect democratisation. Ciano remembered the King, and held his tongue. He was here to mediate, and was determined not to give any of the Blocs - the right wingers, the Christian Democrats or the Left - cause to say he had been unfair. Ciano was sympathetic to the gentleman's points, he said carefully. Certainly democratisation would not occur at any cost and would not throw away everything of use. He was certain the party leaders agreed also on this - Ciano felt them getting angsty, with Nenni bursting to speak. Yet they should not be afraid, added Ciano quickly, to strike forth. No democratisation process could be perfect, and that should not strain their will to make the necessary change. With respect to the esteemed gentleman, who he knew to be an excellent leader of men and servant to his country, there would be no change to the plans. Ciano felt an audible shudder as he said this. He was starting to sound like the King. \n\nThe King himself congratulated him after the meeting, through his private secretary. "Do not let the short sighted hold back what is best for your country," said the man to him before slipping away. The Duce returned to his office, fighting the lingering uncertainty in his gut, and shut the door."

demitaly.45.d:0 "It was almost complete - the project that would be Umberto's legacy and that of Ciano, whether the latter was proud of the distinction or not. A workable democratic system and carefully planned out methodology for the transition had been plotted out. Now all that was left was to wait, in the unbearable silence that moments such as this carried, and hope for the best. The King had decided he would spend the moment on his own to the best of his ability. When he managed to get away from his hangers-on he lingered in a balcony, looking out over his Rome as the lights of the evening began to turn on. It was always beautiful, the most beautiful city on earth - thought the King - and today it would change for the better, although you would not know to look at it. Despite Ciano's doubts, which he continued to express to His Majesty even today, Umberto had faith in his people. Forty years ago his father had given Mussolini the keys to power, and now the son would return those keys to the people, to do with them whatever they chose. Perhaps they would choose wrong, but Umberto had more faith in them than that. They had received the gift of democracy, and whatever happened next that meant something."

#Hot Autumn Events#
hotautumn.1.t:0 "Strike at FIAT!"
hotautumn.1.d:0 "The city of Turin woke up to another day of work - the most important industrial centre of northwestern Italy prepared to see the trams scuttle around the city, filled with men and women heading to their jobs, the smokestacks start to emit their dark columns of smoke, and the middle and upper classes were heading to their comfortable jobs at the many, many factories of the city. And yet, this was not to be another day of work - a strike of FIAT workers was scheduled for the day. Per se, this was not a rare occurrence - numerous strikes had been held during the summer, usually starting and ending in the span of twenty-four hours and controlled by one of the major trade unions, CGIL, CISL and UIL. And yet, this time it was different.\n\nInside FIAT, tensions had been rising for a long time. Dissatisfaction with the trade unions, viewed as bureaucratic, inefficient and all too eager to compromise with the employers, was creeping among the workers, and the continued prosperity of Italy seemed to bless everyone with its golden touch, except the many working class families of Turin and other working class cities. Rent and commodities became more costly and yet wages remained the same, the working hours were long and extenuating, and contracts were always at risk of being rescinded for mysterious and inscrutable reasons, at the whim of those sitting in the offices upstairs. Frustration turned into resentment, and resentment quickly became anger when FIAT announced that numerous contracts would not be renovated at the end of the year, resulting in many workers losing their jobs.\n\nWhen the strike began, it took everyone by surprise. FIAT, the largest car factory of Italy and one of the most important in the country, ground to a halt. The strikes spread like wildfire to numerous other factories across Turin, and it became clear that they wouldn't end at dawn. In the span of a few days, numerous impromptu workers' organizations and committees were formed, declaring an all-out strike. One of the most important industrial hubs of the country was shut down. Of course, the police were quick to mobilize to prevent the strikes from turning into riots, and the trade unions hurried to retake control of the situation. For now, the air is tense, and nobody knows how the situation will develop."
hotautumn.1.a:0 "We can surely talk this out."

hotautumn.2.t:0 "Strikes Spread Across the Country!"
hotautumn.2.d:0 "In the days following the proclamation of the strike at FIAT, many began to realize that Turin was merely the first spark in the tinderbox. Soon, similar strikes were announced in the other major industrial centres of northern Italy, Milan. The working class district of Bicocca, in the northeast of the city, home to numerous important factories such as Pirelli, became the location of numerous strikes and worker protests. The strikes were so prominent and widespread that even the most reluctant trade union, CISL, was tentatively forced to support them for fear of backlash, and the central committees of UIL and CGIL have released a statement giving full support to the strikes. \n\nThe emergency isn't limited to Milan either - Genoa, Florence, Rome, Taranto, and every other industrial city in Italy, even smaller towns, are beginning to flare up with strikes. Every working class sector is involved, from steel mill workers to railway workers, and even other categories such as schoolteachers and nurses are beginning to set up strikes of their own, as the snowball is rapidly picking up speed and size. Their demands are as varied as the many groups they come from, ranging from more stable contracts to better wages and reduced work hours. \n\nWith the police deployed at most locations where the strikes are taking place, the government is confident that no other direct intervention is necessary, and with the trade unions now regaining control of the situation, it's only a matter of time before negotiations begin between the unions and the employers. While they will of course be forced to make concessions, a deal will surely be found in the end, and while many in government are worried about communist or extremist infiltration, a direct intervention from the government could easily do more harm than good."
hotautumn.2.a:0 "This is a sign of a healthy economy."

hotautumn.3.t:0 "The Strike Escalates!"
hotautumn.3.d:0 "It seems like the early hopes for a peaceful resolution to the strikes are being dashed one by one, as strikes around the country escalate in violence and demands. Workers' control of the factories and workplace democracy are only some of the demands and slogans that are starting to be chanted - in Milan, workers attempted to violently occupy the Pirelli factory and were stopped by a police cordon, and in Turin, clashes with the police began after the workers started to accuse the police of being "fascist dogs". The most worrying development of all, which has exacerbated the situation further, is that it seems like communist agitators coming from universities and other youth movements are infiltrating and becoming influential among the striking workers. \n\nCommunist red banners are being raised in marches and protests, as students and workers march together. Universities are once again becoming inflamed with riots of their own, and frequent police sweeps barely seem to amend the problem, as law enforcement forces are starting to be stretched thin in numerous cities. Communist groups are once again starting to occupy classrooms and even entire buildings of universities, and the reaction from fascist groups has infallibly caused numerous clashes among students, some of which resulted in serious injuries and deaths. \n\nPolitics is, as always, divided and torn on how to deal with the issue. Representatives from Democrazia Cristiana have argued that the government should act as a mediator between employers and trade unions to quickly resolve tensions, while the Fronte Democratico has proposed enforcing the demands of the trade unions to safeguard the Italian worker. Finally, the Blocchi Nazionali have warned about the ever present communist menace, and have demanded a hardline stance against the red snakes that crawl in the underbelly of the Italian cities. With the government so bitterly divided, the situation seems more unstable than ever, and with no hope of a quick and peaceful resolution in sight, the Italian economy has started to suffer too."
hotautumn.3.a:0 "This is terrible!"

hotautumn.4.t:0 "FUAN Tries to Occupy the Statale"
hotautumn.4.d:0 "The situation in Milan, already plagued by strikes and riots, has further deteriorated. Following a major clash between right wing and left wing students, the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale, Italy's major right wing student organization, has attempted to occupy a few classrooms in Milan's university, the Statale. Barricading themselves in, the students of FUAN have employed their advantageous position to repel the assaults of their left wing counterparts who attempted to dislodge them. In response, various left wing student groups have declared occupations of their own, and the Statale has been turned into a warzone. \n\nClashes have been violent and relentless, with bottles and rocks being flung by both sides and bloody confrontations happening with crowbars and wrenches being used as weapons. The university's rector has attempted to negotiate with the students to attempt to calm things down, but it appears like his efforts are going to be fruitless. The police have already cordoned the university, and an intervention might be only hours away.\n\nNo comment has arrived from the leaders of FUAN and the representatives of the Blocchi Nazionali, the coalition FUAN is associated with - this leads many to believe that the situation has deteriorated because of radicals within the organization acting independently from their superiors. The chaos at the Statale is only yet another step of Milan's descent into chaos, and many worry that anarchy will soon spread to other universities of Italy, as it did during last spring."
hotautumn.4.a:0 "This is madness! Madness!"

hotautumn.5.t:0 "The Police Clears Out the Statale"
hotautumn.5.d:0 "Following recent events, the rector of the Statale has issued a formal plea for help to the Polizia di Stato and the authorities, asking them to restore order in the university. With any semblance of negotiations breaking down, the police charged into the university, flushing out the students from the university and its surroundings using copious amounts of tear gas, batons and water cannons. Both FUAN and left wing students have been targeted by police, leading to some condemnation coming from many political representatives regarding perceived brutality. \n\nNumerous students have been gravely wounded following the police action, with dozens of them taken into custody by police. Numerous dangerous weapons, including makeshift bombs and a few guns, have been seized, but this new crackdown has done little to defuse tensions - both sides, leftists and neo fascists, accuse the other of collaborating with the police, and the political debate is only getting more heated, as leftist politicians accuse the Blocchi Nazionali of harboring neofascism and radicalism in FUAN while BN politicians accuse the Fronte Democratico to allow communist infiltration in student groups close to their coalition.\n\nWhile the university has been pacified for now, the streets of Milan remain chaotic. Numerous students from leftist groups have now left the universities and are actively agitating the striking workers, spreading communist propaganda and calling for unity between workers and students to change the system. Meanwhile, the city's right wing has not sat idle - local sections of the BN have expressed their condemnation of communist violence in the city and have announced that they won't stand idly while the reds attempt to overtake Milan with the police and the politicians' complacency."
hotautumn.5.a:0 "What can we do?"

hotautumn.6.t:0 "The Hot Autumn"
hotautumn.6.desc:0 "Autumn has begun, and it's not an ordinary season. Everywhere in the country it feels like a subterranean fire is rising, its excruciating heat boiling the atmosphere from the very depths of the earth. An entire town in Campania revolted over a factory being closed; Padova's university has become the theatre of occupations and clashes; numerous left wing associations and local party headquarters in Milan have been firebombed; fascist students have been attacked and given a bloody beating by communist ambushes; and the strikes, all over the country, are only getting bigger. \n\nThe Hot Autumn is upon us, a grand opera of tragedy and conflict. Many are those with stakes in the struggle, and many are being swept into this hot, searing wind that is blowing over Italy. A worker, striking for a fairer job that will let him care for his family in peace; a representative of a Catholic trade union, who sees the world around him slowly consumed by flames; a young idealistic neofascist, who with his fellow students hope to bring Italy back on the right track; and a police officer, standing on the thin line between anarchy and repression. \n\nAll of their stories intertwine, meeting and abandoning each other, as the threads of human lives do. But each and every one of us can only follow one thread in our mortal lives - and so a choice must be made between one of these four crossed destinies."

hotautumn.7.t:0 "An Expired Contract"
hotautumn.7.d:0 "The news arrived like a blast of icy wind. Written in a cold, matter of factly language, the same communique was delivered to dozens and dozens of workers and employees at the large Pirelli industrial complex, a behemoth of smokestacks and work sheds dominating the Bicocca suburb of Milano. The job contracts that were supposed to last for at least another two years had been rescinded, and will be renegotiated - numerous workers were being laid off as the industry was being restructured - pension plans might be in jeopardy - wages will be rediscussed, and likely cut. \n\nMario Calabrò received the very same letter from the hands of a foreman. Reading it in the dim light of his apartment, his wife by his side, as the kids were already asleep. His family, his house, all were now at risk. If he were to be laid off, there was no other option - they would have to move back to Mario's home town, in the deep South. Milano was a mirage - a promise of work for everyone which had attracted many people like him, hoping to escape the poverty of the rural Italian south. Milano was an alluring monster - chewing people and devouring them whole after a lifetime of backbreaking work in the factories. \n\nIt didn't take long for a reaction to blow up, especially with strikes already underway in Turin. At first timidly, labour associations and trade unions announced their intention to protest - the first banners were hanged, the first strikes began. The leaders of Pirelli, captains of finance and shining examples of Italian industriousness, reassured that everything would turn out fine and that contracts would soon be renewed. Still, the situation was already largely out of Pirelli's control, and when the vast majority of factory workers in Bicocca crossed their arms in a strike, Mario was among them."
hotautumn.7.a:0 "Sciopero!"

hotautumn.8.t:0 "Biocca Brucia"
hotautumn.8.d:0 "In all truth, Mario Calabró had never intended to be part of the demonstration in Bicocca that night, although it was also true that his sympathies were firmly on the side of those assorted laborers, students, and even teachers who made up the bulk of the group. He had previously joined similar events over the past few weeks after learning just how precarious his employment situation was. All the same however, on that cool night Mario Calabró, long-suffering factory worker, was only interested in returning home to his family as quickly as possible. That was why he, in a decision that was made so quickly the man himself did not even consciously process it, chose to take a route home that was supposed to be ever so slightly shorter. That choice to shave a few minutes off of his nightly commute would prove to be the most significant of his life. \n\nHe started hearing the shouts two blocks out after leaving the factory. At that moment, he could have changed his mind and gone his regular route, or he could have made another detour using some third way to avoid any unpleasantness. He chose neither option because, as he reasoned to himself as he walked along the sidewalk with his lunch pail dangling at his side, it was likely a noisy but relatively small gathering of his fellow workers and he could easily cross to the other side of the street and continue unimpeded. He wanted to catch his children before they went to bed, and to do that, he needed to move quickly. He had been working longer and longer hours recently with the economic troubles and he was seeing his family less and less. To a devoted family man such as he, such an arrangement was frustrating to the point of maddening but he had no alternatives if he wished to keep his job. \n\nHe ought to have been tipped off to the reality of the situation when the noise kept increasing the entire time he walked, but his concentration on arriving back to his home as soon as possible was damoening his perception of the outside world. That was why he was stunned to discover that instead of the few grizzled factory workers and fresh-faced students he had been expecting there was a veritable horde of angry protestors choking up the street. It only took a single sweep of the grim, determined faces for Mario to realize that he had just walked into the beginnings of the kind of riot that can shake the course of a nation."
hotautumn.8.a:0 "An unassuming player enters the stage."

hotautumn.10.t:0 "A United Struggle"
hotautumn.10.d:0 "There were many things Mario expected from striking, such as police opposition or even fascists countering them. However, he never expected that college students would join them spontaneously. In almost the blink of an eye, Mario went from being surrounded by his fellow workers to being surrounded by strangers who waved communist banners and sang revolutionary songs. \n\nIt was almost surreal, having communist university students walk side by side with men who had fought the USSR. Mario found himself talking to one of the students, a girl from Torino named Anna, and found something surprising. Unlike how the communists seemed to be portrayed, the girl was surprisingly eloquent, and she did not constantly speak about the bloody murder of all the bosses in Italy. It was a stark contrast from the communists at Biocca and Pirelli, who tended to be much more aggressive in their methods. \n\nHowever, before Mario could ask Anna to elaborate more on some of her views, they were separated by more groups joining the strike. While this strike had once merely included factory workers, it now held nurses, teachers, students, and so many more different types of people. Mario felt inspired. People from completely different walks of life were joining their strike, people that Mario would've never interacted with otherwise. They were all united, chanting slogans, waving revolutionary banners, and singing songs which undoubtedly made old Mussolini turn in his grave. Maybe there was hope after all for him and his family."
hotautumn.10.a:0 "The people of Milan stand hand in hand."

hotautumn.11.t:0 "Chats with the Students"
hotautumn.11.d:0 "Throughout his whole life, Mario had never attended political meetings. He'd never been the most political man, so attending a meeting of communist students, of all things, was a brand new thing for him. Mario felt out of place, to an extent. While there were a few people there his age or older, the majority of the attendees were in their 20s - some seemingly even younger. Red flags and banners calling for proletarian - student unity were draped on the walls, as scrawny kids sporting red handkerchiefs and wide smiles exchanged talks with big, brawny steel mill workers.\n\nSoon enough, one of said scrawny kids, wearing a big pair of glasses and an eskimo jacket, took the floor - but his words were soon enough to convince everybody in the room that he was no ordinary youth. "We are here today because we are united in a common struggle. The Italian working classes and the Italian students share a common goal, but moreover, they share a common enemy - the ruling classes, the padroni. Your bosses are the same people who, a few scant years ago, gloated at the sight of blackshirts marching in the streets, saluting them as they beat up, incarcerated, and tortured the proletarians who dared raise their heads against the regime."\n\n"Now, the same thing is happening once again. All over Italy, the working class is once more locked in a deadly struggle with their bosses - with the only slight change that this time, your bosses hide under a facade of democracy as they beat up, incarcerate and torture those who defy them. The politicians representing you used to be fascist bureaucrats and supporters! Do not be deceived, my comrades - ours is not a democracy, for democracy cannot be handed down by those who rule from above. Democracy is won in a struggle - a struggle we must be organized, prepared for, a struggle we must win at every cost! Democracy is a rifle on the shoulder of the worker!""
hotautumn.11.a:0 "The oration is met with thunderous applause!"
hotautumn.11.b:0 "The speech is met with awkward silence and coughing."

hotautumn.12.t:0 "Contro Tutti I Padroni"
hotautumn.12.d:0 "Finally, Mario understood. He always heard his fellow workers talk about communism, but he had never gotten why they were so fervent. He had always brushed them off as radicals who should be ignored. However, Mario saw it all in a different light now, for he had seen the possibility of a future where the world could truly be free. He had hope of a time where there would be no more nights where he went to bed hungry, no more times when him and his family were destitute. That glimpse of a possible future, however small it may be, was worth pursuing in the mind of Mario.\n\nThe dream of revolution grew not only in Mario's mind, but in the minds of many members of the Fronte Democratico. The communists, once only a small subsection of the party, grew like wildfire. The rank and file grew more and more attracted to these radical ideas, and the moderates of the FD were drawn into more and more bitter conflicts with the radical leftists than ever before. These conflicts, as the Hot Autumn raged on, would only weaken the unity of the party."
hotautumn.12.a:0 "The flames of revolution grow and grow..."

hotautumn.13.t:0 "We All March Together"
hotautumn.13.d:0 "Bicocca, early morning. The air was crisp, a cool breeze caressing the trees and the buildings. At the far end of the square, a police detachment, in full riot gear. Armored vans, horses, shields, batons, guns. "They're going all out on this one" said a kid who couldn't have been older than seventeen, spitting on the ground. "They're scared." Calabrò looked to the other side of the square - what seemed like a ragtag assortment of striking workers, angry students, even a few women. Some carried signs wishing death to the ruling classes, others hid molotovs under their coats, possibly with the hope of giving a bit more credibility to that threat. \n\nThe standoff lasted for around four hours. Bottles and rocks were hurled at the police - the police fired back with tear gas. Calabrò felt the burning rise up his nostrils before he was handed a handkerchief soaked in water, and he wrapped it around his mouth and nose as he saw a young girl climb up the barricades and throw a rock at a cop who had advanced a bit too close. Hit on his head, he fell to the ground before being carried back behind the ranks as the policemen regrouped. When the police charge finally happened, the protestors all fled through side alleys, leaving battered barricades and a few burning cars behind. Calabrò finally got home, dirty, broken and exhausted."
hotautumn.13.a:0 "Is this working?"

hotautumn.14.t:0 "For Bread Alone"
hotautumn.14.d:0 "Mario wanted desperately to embrace the idealism of these students, of their communist ideology. However, he knew it was impossible. Political and social equality sounded great, but actually achieving these goals would be nearly impossible, especially considering that the Italian government would fight tooth and nail against communist revolutionaries. The idealism of the students was infectious, but Mario had inoculated himself. He would strike, yes, but he would strike only for bread, and not anything more.\n\nMario's rejection of communism and radicalism was not unique. All throughout the Fronte Democratico, the moderate leftists and the rank and file workers rejected the call of communism, and the voices of the radicals were isolated more and more as fewer and fewer people listened to them. The revolutionary ideals of the communists gave way to the rational pragmatism of the moderates, unifying the party under the cause of bread."
hotautumn.14.a:0 "The fires of revolution have been contained."

hotautumn.15.t:0 "The March of Labour"
hotautumn.15.d:0 "Compared to the chaos that seemed to have gripped Milano, the march organized by the trade unions seemed like an oasis of peace and quiet. In an orderly manner, the workers and representatives of the unions - CGIL, CISL and UIL - marched on the streets, shouting their slogans, waving their flags, displaying their banners, and loudly proclaiming their demands to the seemingly uncaring buildings and streets of the city. Calabrò took part in this wholesome endeavour - he shouted and shouted like the others did, and yet nobody seemed to answer. Even the long cordons of police seemed bored, and rather annoyed at most. \n\nAt the end of the day, a representative from a union, perhaps CGIL, addressed the workers. "Workers, comrades, what we are pursuing here is not utopias - we are building the foundation for a better life! A fairer pay! A safer workplace! And as we exercise our hard won democratic right to protest, we are assured that the government will need to heed our requests! Soon, things will change!" Calabrò, like the others, shouted and cheered at the news. Many other marches, many other protests like that one would take place - making the same demands, asking for the same things, always speaking to the same uncaring faces of policemen, buildings and streets."
hotautumn.15.a:0 "Do things ever change?"

hotautumn.16.t:0 "Organizing the Rally"
hotautumn.16.d:0 "Milano is a big city - and despite this, news still spread fast. Some say that the idea of the rally was first proposed by student groups, then passed on to small, independent unions. From there, it snowballed. Steel workers, farmers, miners, nurses, teachers, soon enough association after association announced they'd show up. Finally, the big ones - CGIL, CISL and UIL all announced they would take part in the rally, likely out of fear of losing every little crumb of credibility they had left. And soon enough, everybody seemed to be heading for Rome. \n\nThe government had been cautious - some urged for letting the protest happen, others demanded it shut down. Eventually, to ease tensions, the mass strike was allowed to happen, with an extraordinarily large police and military deployment. Milano, Torino, Taranto, Genova, the centres of insurrection had seemed to slow down - as everybody was busy preparing for what was to come. Signs were made, bigger than ever - new slogans were crafted, catchier and more appealing - meetings were held, speeches written, fists raised. \n\nCalabrò was not enthusiastic about the idea of the rally at first. The train ticket was costly, but then a friend of his, with contacts in CGIL, offered him a free one. He was afraid his wife would complain, but she actually encouraged him to go, even tentatively smiling. All his friends and colleagues were planning to go. After all, a little bit of hope never hurt anybody."
hotautumn.16.a:0 "Perhaps we can change things."

hotautumn.17.t:0 "A Strike in Rome"
hotautumn.17.d:0 "This time, it was different. This time, the crowd was bigger, far bigger than any crowd most people there had ever seen before. This time, the shouts of the thousands of workers, students, women, elderly men, former political exiles, immigrants, ex colonial subjects, homosexuals, idealists, dreamers, fighters, all the oppressed, the shunned, the weak - their shouts echoed in the very halls that had held up the foundations of the Italian state ever since it was conceived. The Fori Imperiali echoed with the cries of the downtrodden - and the ancient stones answered with silence. \n\nIn response, the state was not afraid to flex its muscles. Tanks, APCs, armed soldiers, entire phalanxes of policemen and Carabinieri armed to the teeth, even some helicopters circling the skies of the Eternal City. There were many moments in which the crowd was about to erupt into violence - as if a spark would be enough to set Rome ablaze. But that spark never came. The rally came and went, shouting its cries into the halls of power - and the halls of power answered with silence. \n\nIn the end, politicians climbed their stages, as they always do. Promising solutions, promising that the people's voice has been heard. A few years ago, when the country was hopefully looking at a new future, this would have worked. Now, one crucial thing changed - once silenced, the Italian people were allowed to have a voice, and it was learning to use it too. Now, many were starting to learn that a voice wouldn't be enough, and more incisive methods were needed to make a point. Young leftists were ever more disillusioned. Frustrated. Angry."
hotautumn.17.a:0 "One way or another, things will change."

hotautumn.18.t:0 "CGIL, CISL, and UIL"
hotautumn.18.d:0 ""It sounds like a waste of time to me." These men in their fancy suits and combed hair provided stark contrast to Mario's own light blue denim clothing. He normally wouldn't wear his protective gear outside of work, but someone had suggested it might make a statement when the union representatives arrived. Instead, he just felt silly, sitting at this desk in front of these suits. \n\n"I assure you, Mister Calabrò..." The head suit reassured the steel worker as he already had so frequently in this conversation. "It will be most beneficial, to both the union and to the workers who make up the union.." He gestured towards Mario. "Such as yourself." \n\nMario Calabrò had his arms crossed over his chest in quiet, but weakening defiance. "There's more important things going on. What would a debate solve? Much less a debate between union boys. Just... Have your debate, why should we care?" \n\n"Transparency, Mister Calabrò. Transparency, participation of the workers in the affairs of the union, expanding your perspective... You ask why you and people like you should care, I ask you instead, why shouldn't you?" The representative leaned back in his chair at the end of his explanation. \n\nThe two sat in silence for an uncomfortably long amount of time, though the Union Suit sure didn't seem all that disquieted as Mario mulled over the offer in his head. With a final sigh, he let his shoulders slump. "How long do you expect it to take?""
hotautumn.18.a:0 "An hour, two at most."

hotautumn.20.t:0 "Roundtable with the Workers"
hotautumn.20.d:0 "The steel workers had their collective suspicions going into this, but they had to admit, it was certainly more entertaining than they had expected. The suits up on the stage had debated things like union policy, union dues, and issues facing the CISL itself. Really, it was enough to put the most politicized laborer right to sleep, that is, until the topic of reaching out to the other unions came around. \n\nThe CISL might be considered radical by Italy as a whole, but they were nothing compared to the outright socialists and communists in the CGIL. There was bad blood between the CISL, who looked to reform the system, and the CGIL, who advocated tearing it all down and starting anew. So, the yawning and droopy-eyed audience began to blink and sit up straight when the mediators asked the fancy suit men as to whether or not the union should join forces with the CGIL.\n\n"We broke off from the radicals for a damn good reason!" The suit sitting furthest to the right was making a real show of this. He might not have, had his compatriots seated on the other side of the forum admitted to understanding some of the benefits of such an alliance. "If they'd had their way, they'd have forced us into this crisis long ago!" \n\n"The need for solidarity and unity supersedes individual political disagreements in times like these!" One of the other speakers- the most eager among them to work with the communists, notably- rose to the defense of the idea. "If we back down and negotiate with the corporations now, they'll think that the working class can be easily bullied! Pushed around!" \n\n"So you would sell the worker's soul to the rabid communists instead?" \n\n"The only soul on sale here sir, is your own." \n\nThe crowd listened, and as the voices lowered and the fire and fury cooled, a prevailing attitude took hold of the crowd. The people cry out with one voice, and they say..."
hotautumn.20.a:0 "Better dead than red!"
hotautumn.20.b:0 "Solidarity forever!"

hotautumn.21.t:0 "The Olive Branch"
hotautumn.21.d:0 "The debate all but ended there, though like with most things related to the union suits, it took a good while for the debate itself to figure that out. In the end, the men in suits shook hands, some murmured words between each other, and went their separate ways. The speaker who railed against an alliance with the CGIL took one last look over the crowd who had been swayed significantly in the other direction. \n\nMany workers had walked into that meeting hall without much of a mind to the upcoming Union elections, but by the time he left, he had decided. He'd stop by the union offices next week, and the CISL would hear what he had to say. \n\nWhat made them so different from a CGIL auto worker? He didn't join this Union for the politics, for the purity of its ideologues or any of its particularly high-minded ideals beyond what they said they stood for. The rights and privileges of the average worker, and how could that be achieved if they refused to work together? \n\nAnd so, when the time came to vote, he'd vote for solidarity and not division. A united general strike was a strong general strike, and the parliament up in Rome would certainly have to listen to them. Social Democrat, Christian Democrat, Socialist, Communist, what difference did it make when wages were low for all of those workers, regardless of their personal political inclinations? This fight was the fight for all workers, for all laborers, and he was part of the whole, weren't they? \n\nFrancesco's debate appeared to be a success, and Mario walked away from the debates with a greater sense of solidarity with his fellow worker than ever before. Should CGIL agree to it, they and CISL would stand, linked arm in arm, and the unions would in turn lock arms with the workers they represented, both those unionized and otherwise."

hotautumn.22.t:0 "The Unions Unite"
hotautumn.22.d:0 "CISL reaching out to CGIL was only the first step into forming a broad coalition for all workers. The radicals in the CGIL were nothing if not unpredictable. The union was made up of far leftists- communists and socialists, some even whispered that some anarchists were connected to the Union as well, though that was simple gossip. They were revolutionaries- both of the violent and voting sorts- and revolutionaries were hot of head and quick to anger, everyone knew. Would they react favorably to the offer? Would bad blood get in the way of progress? \n\nFrancesco Inceli leaned forward, hands steepled together, foot tapping rapidly on the ground. He was already running disaster scenarios through his head. CISL had been less than eager to join in on the General Strike than CGIL was, and even the UIL seemed more enthusiastic about it than CISL had been. Could they go to the UIL if the CGIL refused them? Or perhaps they could spin a refusal to earn the attention of their workers somehow... If only... \n\nMario Callabrò sat back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest. It was time to see just how dedicated to the cause these Socialists were. Would they put aside their personal grievances to join forces with him, and men like him? He didn't see any harm in their alliance if it went through, but why should it bother him- or anyone like him- if the communists would not work with them? They could do this on their own, but it would be better to do it together, even a blind man could see that. \n\nThen, the doors opened, and three figures stepped into the room, practically flying on their feet. The first figure had a CISL pin on his chest, and stepped to the side with a wide smile on his face. The second, a pin with the CGIL symbol proudly placed on his own chest, practically swept into the room, walking right up to Francesco who was still standing up. The third entered at a much more relaxed pace, leaning against the doorframe. \n\nOnce face to face with Mister Inceli, the CGIL representative wasted no words, instead he grabbed the man's hand with a firm grip, and pressed his lips to Francesco's cheek, a display that caught the CISL rep off-guard, much to the amusement of the workers that filled the room behind them. "We are told that you are the man to thank, Mister Inceli!" \n\nFrancesco blinked as he recovered his senses. He looked around the room, and then past the Communist representative. "We?" \n\nThe last man stepped through the door frame, his UIL pin becoming visible in the light of the room. He extended a hand towards Francesco Inceli and smiled faintly. "We need only shake on it, Mister Inceli.""

hotautumn.23.d:0 "Rather than the disparate, separated and scattered cries from across the North of Italy, the Italian worker now stood united and for the first time, all three of the major northern unions- the moderates of the CISL, the radicals of the CGIL, and the Christians of the UIL- all stood in solidarity and host their first joint rally in the streets of Milan. Francesco never thought he'd see the day. He never thought he'd want to be part of it either, he recalled- with a little bit of shame admittedly- how he'd rail against communism and socialism when he was younger, when Virgilio was still just a tyke. Oh, he never thought that the people were anything more than idiots duped into a system that was incapable of standing up to pressure of any sort. But then he spoke here today, he spoke of the disparity of wealth between the working man and the rich man. He spoke of safety regulations and the insane expectations placed on workers for their productivity. And when he looked among the masses gathered before him, he could not tell who was a Socialist and who was not. When he waved his goodbyes to the crowd to make room for the next speaker, all of the workers made their approval known. Mario Callabrò had never thought he'd see the day, but not only was it here, but he was standing here, in the midst of it. Many of the CISL faithful had not attended the rally, something of an ironic striking of the strike, out of political convictions, but many more workers found their sense of worker unity and allegiance when the call was made. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw some of the fellow rally attendees stumble and fall, some shouts and harsh words were said. By the time Mario made it over to help the fallen man to his feet, the stumblers were already gathering themselves. \n\n"Some jackass was shoving their way through the crowd towards the exit." The fallen worker muttered as he rubbed his head. A bump, nothing more. "I can't see him anymore, he must've been in a hurry, I suppose." \n\nNone of the men recognized the man as someone from any of their unions, but the matter soon gave way to introductions and banter, as men of all three unions continued to mingle and build bridges."

It had been an eventful two weeks for him, from deciding to reach out to the CGIL, to organizing the debate and campaigning for his proposal to make it through the election, to organizing and hosting the rally with not one, nor two, but three of the largest unions in Italy attending? Any man would be exhausted. \n\nShaking hands once more with the representatives of the CGIL and UIL, he accepted the cheek kisses- socialist fraternal kisses, he was told- begrudgingly before waving his farewells. He stepped down from the stage, and into the crowd that still filled the block even as many of them were filtering out to leave. He was often sidetracked, shaking hands and accepting rough-handed pats on the back from the workers as he made his way, slowly but surely, towards his car parked behind the stage. \n\nThe silence and stale air of the interior of his car was welcome. He'd never liked driving much, the car was too small, too restraining, and always smelled too much like an old man. Tonight though, those features brought him a strange sort of comfort. He leaned back, and allowed himself a moment to stare up at the moon and rest.\n\nIt simply wouldn't do to fall asleep here, though. Home was''t far, and more than anything else, what he wanted was his bed, and some real, actual, restful sleep. He stuck the key in the ignition and turned it. \n\nThe engine turned over once, twice, and then it made a clicking noise. Then there was only light and noise as the car erupted into a fireball and sent glass and steel everywhere."

They had damned Italian blood running through their veins, and they would be damned before allowing socialism to corrupt the Italian spirit and workforce. \n\nWhen the gentleman sitting to the right finished his closing statements, he was met with resounding applause and cheers from the crowd. His opponent and his cohorts in turn, received sparse applause and an awkward, oppressive silence once their statement was finished. It was clear to all in the building what direction this debate had swung the decision in, and it wasn't what Francesco had intended at all. \n\nThe vote came just over a week later, and while generally agreeing on most of the proposed policy changes, the results made it clear that any attempts at aligning themselves with the other Unions would not be tolerated by the workers themselves, voting a crushing eighty-five percent to maintain their own policies at the expense of solidarity. \n\nThe skies might have been clear outside, but a shadow still seemed to loom over Francesco. What more could he have done? Why was he so stupid as to put it to a vote? The individual worker didn't know the big picture, and you can't explain something like that over the course of an hour. There was no time to dwell on the past though, he had to plan for what would come next. \n\nPlanning that Mario was already beginning. The debate stirred something in him. Why was there such a concerted effort to align CISL with the Socialists, exactly? What game was CGIL playing with CISL and its common men? He didn't know, and he didn't like such an overt attempt at manipulating them. Nothing would come of it right now, but ideas were already being whispered between the workers, ideas to show them the price of underestimating CISL..."

hotautumn.26.d:0 ""Friends, I come to you with news that will not shock nor surprise you, but is grim nonetheless." Paolo Voltolini was no suit, no Union man, but he had acted as a voice above the rest after the Union Vote. For the past couple weeks, he had been speaking to union workers and advocates all over Milan, claiming that the Communists not only tried to infiltrate the CISL, but that they attempted to manipulate the vote. Mario Calabrò was no fan of communists, but he was no wackjob either. \n\n The accusations were at first met with suspicion and skepticism. It sounded like a fascist conspiracy theory, but an idea repeated often enough and with enough conviction eventually takes on a life of its own. What if the Communists really did have the CISL suits in their pocket? What if they really were plotting to subsume the Union into their own for political gain? \n\n"I was like many of you at first. I didn't believe the rumors, the gossip, the mutterings about Communist influence and manipulations. Wrote it off! After all, I even had friends in the CGIL, why would they ever turn on me?" He was a gifted speaker, and with this dramatic pause, he had the gathering of workers practically standing on their toes, eagerly anticipating the rest of the speech.\n\n"But it was fortunate I'd have those friends! For one of them, conscience won out over ideology, and he told me of the plan that was being whispered between them. I still didn't believe him, until he took me to their headquarters and had me listen in on a conversation! It was true! Now that they've failed to open the door into CISL through the vote, they are making plans to infiltrate our ranks and spread their revolutionary ideology!" Mario could feel his own blood rising involuntarily, as much as he knew this man was speaking nonsense, he was still an effective speaker, and there was something about his message that he seemed to want to believe, but he couldn't put his finger on it. \n\n"Well, what about it then, men?" He held out his hands to either side. "Are we going to roll over and allow them to use us for their own ends?!" An open ended question, one that was answered with anger and frustration from among the crowd. \n\nBut then, something he didn't expect. They were red-faced in their rage, and they began to filter out of the room the speech was taking place in. A stunned Durante and Mario alike watched them storm out of the room and into the streets outside. The mob certainly wasn't about to allow any of that, and they were going to let the CGIL boys know that..."

A small mob of CISL union workers had arrived mere moments before, hurling small projectiles towards the offices of the socialist union. When the CGIL workers walked out to meet them, they did not hold back. \n\n"Commies like you ought to learn not to stick your noses where they don't belong!" One voice said, his demands punctuated by a stone thrown to land at the feet of the opposition, doing nothing but eliciting a reply from the other side of the aisle. \n\n"Perhaps you should heed your own advice, suckling little pigs!" Came the reply from somewhere amidst the gathered Communist workers. The supporting shouts and follow-up jeers were interrupted when the CISL workers rushed the aisle to attack the CIGL workers head-on.\n\nWhere once insults and jeers were being exchanged, fists and feet took their place. The communists fell back at first, surprised at the sudden ferocity of their assailants. But with their numbers and their indignation, they rallied quickly, and met them with as much gusto as workers could muster. \n\nThe fight had only barely begun- and without any side gaining any seeming advantage in the short duration- when the flash of lights and wail of sirens interrupted the brawl. Like cats caught fighting in an alley, the workers scattered and rushed away from the arrival of the police officers, who rushed onto the scene with batons raised. \n\nA small skirmish, in truth, but all across the North of Italy, such suspicions and tensions flared up in isolated cases such as these. Workers stand as opposed to one another as they do to their supposed enemies as the Hot Autumn blazes on."

While members of Parliament skillfully avoided directly crediting the Strike itself as the primary catalyst for the passing of a recent bill, the Italian people were not fooled. This was a victory for the Workers, not a gift from a benevolent ruling class. \n\nThe breadth of the bill was expansive, covering most of the most pressing issues that the leaders of the striking Unions cited as their primary purposes for the strike. Poor wages and deteriorating infrastructure, inadequate social safety nets and even worse safety conditions, the list was long, and the proposed bill couldn't possibly cover it all. Now union leaders will need to decide if the government's response to the crisis is adequate. \n\nUntil then, the workers will remain on strike, and they, along with the protesting students and police, will remain active in the streets. In spite of the news, tensions are still high across the country, and few have much of any hope that any unenthusiastic legislation is going to put an end to the crisis any time soon."

A mixture of arguments and conversations tore through the CSIL office like a knife through butter. Francesco Inceli eyed the list of names and numbers across his desk, and gave a sigh. \n\nThe union was large, and it was a target. Allegations of corruption were common as were the occasional threat from many groups. The left wanted more entreaties, the right wanted them to bash Bolshevists- and the phones never stopped ringing. It was in times like these that Francesco did his best to remain calm; for he had calls to make. \n\nSpecifically there were three things on his mind, though he had enough time to do them today .\n\nA call to Milan, where a roundtable would be offered and workers negotiated with. \n\nA call to Rome, where investigations were being made into the unions. \n\nAnd finally, a call to home. His son and he had several disagreements, but there was always the possibility that the two could reconcile. There was hope."

hotautumn.30.d:0 ""I'm telling you, Francesco, they won't go for it." The voice on the other end of the line sounded exasperated, tired even. They'd been arguing in a circle for going on eight minutes, though it sure felt longer. But neither Francesco Inceli nor Timoteo Sartor could exactly just hang up the phones and do their job without coming to an agreement of some kind. \n\n"Then the strike's going to peter out if we can't organize this damn thing. The companies will come back in once one Union settles and leverage us back down into the pavement." Inceli's rebuttal was weak, he knew, but it was all he had, and he wasn't wrong either. His point just failed to address the opposing point. Inceli replied, leaning over his desk with a desperate expression that bled into his voice. \n\n"You overestimate how much trust they have in us.at the end of the day. Any agreement we come to with the Communists will be suspect. They'll think we've sold them out if we make any kind of accord in private rooms and phone calls." The grumbling came through on the other side, entirely right in his assertions too. "They don't trust us, Francesco." \n\nFrancesco fell silent for a long time, allowing the quiet to dominate the line for nearly an entire minute. Sartor was about to speak up when Inceli suddenly broke the silence. "What if it wasn't up to us?" \n\n"You mean we lie to them and say that we were approached first? Or..." \n\n"No, I mean, make it a broad union vote, rather than an internal decision. There's a few issues the Union's voting on in a few weeks, why not make opening up lines of discussion with the other Unions one of those issues?" \n\n"And what happens if they don't vote for it? "\n\n"We can try to convince them. They're good men, by and large, and should listen to reason when reason presents itself. Maybe we have a rally beforehand, or a debate, perhaps? Let them make up their own mind, and pray to God that they make the right decision.""

hotautumn.31.d:0 "Even when they happened through a cable, discussions with the leadership of CISL followed a sort of liturgical ritual. After a bored telephone operator redirected his call, Francesco waited patiently and devoutly for a voice to answer him. As the responder demanded to know who the caller was, Francesco answered - and then he had to wait again to be redirected to the proper office, with a buzzing hum ringing inside the phone. Finally, a booming voice, with a very distinguishable Roman accent, rang out - "Ah, I've been expecting your call!" \n\nAfter the ritual small talk about the foggy weather of Milano and the sweltering heat of Rome, as well as an exchange of completely irrelevant news about the respective families, Francesco heard the question he was expecting - "So, what can you tell me about the situation at Bicocca?". What could be told about an entire district in open revolt, where brutal riots are becoming the norm and blood dirties the sidewalks? For once, Francesco decided to be extraordinarily blunt. "Well, the situation might be somewhat inconvenient right now, but I'm sure everything will soon be under control." \n\n"That's what I wanted to hear!" said the bellowing voice of his superior. "See, I was right when I noticed you. From now on, you can consider yourself in charge of the CISL section for all of Pirelli - and if any of those other boring Milanese pansies try to stop you, just tell me and we'll shut them up!" Francesco swallowed, the noise he made covered by the laughter on the other end of the line. "Now I have to go, I'm terribly busy these days - apparently a bunch of goddamn communist students set fire to a factory shed in Roma Nord and they're trying to pin it on us! Can you believe it?! Anyway, good luck in Milano - and remember, don't disappoint me! Buonasera, ciao, ciao, cia-". A click was followed by silence - and the liturgy ended."

hotautumn.32.d:0 "Originally founded in 1918, the Italian Confederation of Labour was the first major Catholic inspired trade union in the country - and was quickly shut down by the fascist regime. During the Italian transition to democracy, it was reorganized as the Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions, or CISL for short, and quickly rose to prominence as one of the major unions in the country. Unlike the other major unions, suspected of being dens of socialists or, God forbid, communists, CISL has always been the union for the upstanding, respectable Italian worker and foreman - a man such as Francesco Inceli. \n\nCISL has always been openly and unapologetically closely affiliated with DC, and some of its critics say that the habits of the party were quickly reflected by the union - some of its other critics say that this is in fact because CISL is nothing more than a DC sock puppet. Many workers, even those who shared the views of the union, felt that CISL was not acting in their interests, but in those of the party. Combined with the somewhat embarrassing instances of corruption going on in the union, this severely harmed the legitimacy of CISL in the eyes of those people it was meant to represent. Despite this, CISL was still one of the biggest unions in Italy, and was often able to dictate its line to other, smaller unions such as UIL. \n\nThese and more facts roamed around Francesco's head as he sat at his office desk once again, staring at his phone, while the white bakelite box stared him back. Corruption was an issue that could be too hard to tackle, and doing it in this delicate situation could be counterproductive - but it would go at great lengths to rehabilitate CISL's image in the eyes of workers, and possible ease tensions as workers will be more willing to let CISL negotiate a solution to the crisis. Another, much safer, option would be to instead use CISL's political weight to convince a smaller union, such as UIL, to work in tandem with CISL and safeguard the latter's position as the main anti-socialist trade union. Two phone numbers, hastily written on a note, sit on Francesco's desk, waiting for a decision."

Demotions and expulsions became the norm, and quite a few prominent names in the local section of CISL received a visit from the Guardia di Finanza. And amidst all this, Francesco Inceli sat content in his office, taking the chance to fill the spots left vacant with men he trusted. \n\nA ring filled the hot, humid air of the office. Francesco picked up the phone, greeted by the voice of one of his colleagues. "What the fuck do you think you're doing?!" The man on the other side of the cable was talking faster, and breathing ever faster. "There's goddamn Fiamme Gialle in my office! They're taking my papers! This all started because of you!

Representatives from DC and even some members of FD spoke in front of an audience of CISL and UIL bureaucrats, reassuring the people that a peaceful resolution to the current crisis would be found through dialogue and mutual understanding between labour, businesses, and government. A victory against radicalism, for sure - and as the glasses of the politicians touch each other in celebratory toasts, the riots in the streets of Italy show no sign of subsiding."

"Francesco Inceli, I'm with CISL. I'm calling to speak with Representative Diolo?" \n\nAnother waiting period just long enough to be irritating, but not long enough to actually be inconvenient, and then the line was picked up, answered by a voice hoarse and whispery. "Nestore Diolo, UIL." Representative Diolo sounded older than he was, but he was still an old man by union standards. \n\n"Nestore. It's Francesco. Again." \n\nThe silence on the other end of the line was deafening, but eventually, Nestore did respond. "Mister Inceli. How can I help you?" He spoke in an even, cool tone, one tinged with suspicion- well-earned suspicion, admittedly. \n\nGod above, Francesco hated doing this. He'd have to veil his disgust for the time being though. "I have, erm, found myself in charge of the local offices for this branch of the Union, Nestore, and it's come to my attention that your own Union's branch here is having some... Funding problems, is that correct?" \n\nHe was met with a silence more telling than any audible confirmation could be. Idly scratching down a note, he nodded to himself before clearing his throat and continuing. "If, maybe, you and your union would be willing to do something for us, we could help with that." \n\nAnother long silence.

Francesco Inceli was enjoying his morning mug of coffee while looking over Le Conquiste del Lavoro, and the news within was somehow the more bitter of the two. It was good news, if you stood far enough back, but it did not sit well with the Representative regardless. \n\nThe story was about the Communists in the CGIL accusing the UIL of corruption with regards to recent negotiations with Fiat, where they adopted an uncharacteristically conciliatory stance towards the company. Of course, UIL was corrupt, but not in the way that the Communists were accusing them of. If you listened to CGIL, you'd believe that the UIL was taking bribes from either Rome or Fiat, to moderate their position, but in reality, it was CISL they were being influenced by. \n\nIt took a few more private conversations, and of course, promises of financial and political support should UIL adjust a few troublesome policies in order to be more in line with that of CISL's. They had overestimated how much the results of the deal would satiate the workers, the bribe money had gone to good causes, most of it anyways. The UIL was able to keep its various worker programs and its newsletter funded as of late, but that seemed to matter little and less for their own workers, who saw the recent compromises as a stain upon the Union's name, and suddenly, their support of the union was wavering. \n\nThere was a joke somewhere in the workers revolting against the Union, but while that wasn't the intended effect, CISL would benefit. UIL would never admit to bowing to another union, that may not be enough to kill one of Italy's largest unions, but it would absolutely test its limits. So in effect, while the other two largest unions in Italy bickered, CISL could stay, aloof and seemingly focused on what the union was founded to do in the first place. \n\nAll he needed to do was strongarm innocent and hardworking men into taking the fall for his politicking.

"Friends, let me firstly thank you all for taking the time to meet with me today. I know many of you had to drive a long way, your labors have not been overlooked." The appreciation did not seem to elicit much of a reaction, but it was there more for sincerity's sake anyways. \n\nHe continued. "I understand- we, understand- that the union, is not perfect. It cannot be perfect, for despite all our lofty rhetoric, we are only human at the end of the day. I know, it must be shocking for you to hear a man in a suit admit that out loud." That at least gathered a few isolated chuckles. He was winning them over, but slower than he'd hoped. \n\n"But... We didn't sign up for perfection, now did we? Perfection is something that only exists in fantasy and dreams. This is why perfection is the domain of the revolutionary, and not the reformer. We know you have heard the recent news, and we want to reaffirm, with all of you, our continued commitment to constant ceaseless improvement. Not just in the workplaces and in conditions for the workers, but also in our own conduct, our own management, and our own effectiveness as a Union." \n\nThere were no smiles, no cheers, no enthusiastic applause, but they were nodding, nodding!

Things have only gotten worse for CGIL and UIL in the weeks following the start of the Strike, and they certainly didn't seem to be improving, or even in much of a position to effectively negotiate. \n\nCISL on the other hand? Business as usual, really, and not only that, but they were able to take advantage of the chaos and grow as a union, continuing to entrench themselves as the dominant Union in Northern Italy as the Strike wears on, grabbing more and more of the Government in Rome's attention as they did so. If there was going to be anyone who could bring this strike to an end in favor of the working man, why not CISL? \n\nThe General Strike was far from over, but slowly but surely, many opinions began to turn.

He'd heard the news of the barricade at the Statale and how the situation had grown more volatile since it began, but he- as much as he was ashamed to admit it- was too distracted with the General Strike to check on his son Virgilio, a student at that very university. \n\nAnd more distressingly? A member of the gang that had occupied the campus and was running that barricade. He needed answers, and could feel his own desperation mounting as he dialed the college's number once more, and sat in tense anticipation as the phone rang... And rang... \n\nAnd was actually picked up this time. He practically gasped as the voice of a young woman came on the other side. "This is Gia, with the Statale, who is this calling?" \n\n"Francesco, uh Francesco Inceli. I'm calling after a student, Virgilio Inceli?" \n\nSilence for a moment, save for the distant muttering of "Gia" with others that she was apparently standing with. After a moment of this, her voice returned to the line. "You're in luck, Mister Inceli. Virgilio was seen leaving the campus, he was going to the train stations, it looked like. No one knows where he-" \n\nThe phone hit the cradle at what must have been record speed, and within moments, Francesco Inceli was in a dead sprint, jacket, hat, and briefcase held close against his chest with the same arm. Out of the union offices, he ran to his car. \n\nThis might be the last time he gets to see his son, and he would make it count."

hotautumn.40.t:0 "Breaking the Silence"
hotautumn.40.d:0 "A key turned in the lock. The door opened. Feet stepped over a balcony they hadn't crossed in years, and father and son stood face to face. \n\nThey were a strange pair. One of them dressed in the suit and tie of any respectable professional union operative, complete with graying hair and tired eyes. The other sporting a leather jacket, a shaved head, and a fasces pin. \n\nFor a moment there was silence. Father was the first to break it. \n\n"Are you alright? I heard what happened at the Stalale." \n\nOf course. He had seen what had happened on the TV and wanted to make sure if his precious little boy was okay. \n\n"I'm fine." \n\nThe silence returned, colder and emptier than before. This time, Virgilio spoke. \n\n"I came to see if you had changed your mind." \n\n"About you joining that group of Nazi performance artists? Of course I haven't." \n\nThe words came out faster and harsher than Father first had intended. When he spoke again, there was a quiver in his voice. \n\n"But you're still my son." \n\nThe silence was deeper than ever, an abyss between father and son like a thousand boxes of emptiness in a forgotten warehouse. \n\nThen Virgilio spoke once more."

hotautumn.41.t:0 "Shattered Idealism"
hotautumn.41.d:0 ""And if only I had a father." Virgilio spat back in a whisper like the crack of a whip. His father physically drew back, as if physically struck by the venom in his own son's eyes and words. \n\n"Virgilio I-" The father quickly leaned back in, hands open in a pleading, welcoming gesture, a gesture that his son had no intention of reciprocating nor accepting. \n\n"The nation stands atop a knife's edge!" He declared, raising a hand towards the doorway, his gaze growing harder as he spoke. "On one side, is socialist suffering and death! On the other is a national restoration for us and generations to come! If only I had a father who fought to push the nation towards restoration with me!" \n\nHis father tried to speak up, he reached out to put a reassuring hand on Virgilio's shoulder, but the youth slapped it away, stepping forward in turn with an accusing finger to poke into his father's chest. "It's not too late." He whispered, a voice trembling with emotion. Rage? Sorrow? Who was to tell? "Come with me, to the barricades. We'll destroy the socialist threat, we'll save Italy, father." \n\nAnother chasm of quiet emerged between the two, even as they stood close together, eyes locked, neither of the two willing to blink first. It would only be an exhalation from Virgilio's father that broke the stilled air. \n\n"No matter what." He whispered, stepping back, eyes cast meekly to his feet. "No matter what Virgilio, you are still my son." And then he turned on his feet, from the balcony, back and into the home. \n\nThere would be no time for tears. No time to rage or shout. With trembling fists and burning eyes, Virgilio turned from home and began the trek back to the barricade. This was good, he decided. After all, in the fight against evil, there is no greater weapon than anger. Unfettered, righteous rage burned in like a fire in his belly, and he'd be all the greater a warrior for it, and all Italy would bear witness, he knew."

hotautumn.42.d:0 "One of the most curious phenomena about humanity is how, in large enough quantities, a group of people are indistinguishable from a herd of animals. Driven by instinct and reaction rather than by the rationality and emotion they display on an individual-by-individual case, they are easy to panic, to send into flight, or to fight as if their life depended on it. \n\nMore curious still, is how when that mass of humanity grows even larger, they begin to resemble more a force of nature. A herd of animals might act erratically, but it's always a response, you can always tell that there's something pushing them in one direction or another, at the end of the day. But when the situation gets as crowded and the tensions rise as high as they did at the barricade tonight, cause and effect leave the realm of the material and become something arcane, ought not be understood because it cannot. \n\nAnd like the force of nature it was, the protests and the barricade broke the tension. Did someone throw something? Did the shouts and insults finally strike a nerve? Did someone move too erratically, too suddenly, and unleash the cascade of violence? Was it the fault of the left, or that of the right? \n\nDoes it matter? \n\nIt was all consuming, the suddenness and completeness of the outbreak. All at once, the masses of protesting students rushed forward, with little else but fist, branch and stone to wield against their foe in the barricade. Chants and shouts erupted as the sides clashed together in a violent cacophony. And Virgilio, for one split second, saw the entire scene with a crystalline, almost otherworldly clarity - before everything turned into a blur."

hotautumn.43.d:0 "It would have been poetic if the skies were cloudy the day of the Statale clashes. But alas, there were no threatening storm clouds. The day was warm and pleasant and the sky was blue, accented by birds circling and hunting. \n\nHad any of these intrepid avians cared to look down upon the chaos unfolding, they would have seen three colors: red, grey, and black. \n\nRed, naturally were the Leftists. Rabble rousers, radicals, and decent men all together, no doubt hoping to permanently destroy Italian greatness, or perhaps reform it to something fair and just. \n\nThe right-wing youth would have imagined themselves as the "blacks", but they were too disorganized, too idealistic and (for the moment) not quite committed to their professed ideals of violence and autocracy to merit that label. So they were the greys. \n\nThe blacks were the police. Forced to spend weeks in full riot gear carrying heavy batons and guns, their nerves were at the breaking point. The officers, brave, exhausted, extraordinarily corrupt protectors of the innocent Italian public, wanted the disorder to end at any cost. \n\nWhen the leftists charged, it was for them a heroic and radical action to defend the Italian workers. For the FUAN, it was the inevitable clash of ideologies necessary for a strong national future. \n\nFor the police, it was an excuse. \n\nAs if they were a single great beast from the stories, the black armored line roared and surged forwards.  \n\nThen there were no more colors, no more sides. The crowd was one sea of violence and hatred, when the only impulse was to attack, and the only hope to escape. \n\nBatons rose and fell, stones were thrown, shots rang from one corner or another, and all was chaos."

hotautumn.44.d:0 "Like a fire, the violence of the night burned hot and bright. But the harder the fire burns, the faster it runs its course. The moon had not even climbed into the sky by the time this particular fire had burnt itself out. \n\nLike ashes, the survivors scattered to the winds. To the stations and their homes the police officers went on exhausted feet and with weary eyes. To their homes went both besieger and besieged, leftist and rightist, covering their bloodied and battered faces, blackened eyes, broken noses and shattered smiles. \n\nBut the dead remained, all of them splintered and broken in their own horrifyingly unique way. Among the broken and trampled lay Virgilio Inceli, with eyes wide in shock and a neck snapped back in an unnatural manner, half-buried beneath the debris of the palisade. \n\nIn short, it was no way for Francesco to find his son. but it was still about what he had expected. Walking over to his son's corpse, he removed the detritus and wreckage from atop his smashed form and freed his body from the rubble. Sitting down, he placed his son's head on his lap and sighed, closing his own eyes even while his own hand closed the eyelids over Virgilio's. \n\nHe looked like he was sleeping when his eyes were closed. That made it a little more bearable at least. With a trembling hand, he reached over and took Virgilio's own blood-soaked hand in his own, trying to ignore the slight feelings of splintering bone and battered flesh as he held his son's hand for one last time. \n\nAnd there he sat, tears falling like the rain from eyes squeezed shut, interrupted only by an occasional gasping sob, extinguished the last embers of the fire that once raged in this place. \n\nWhen the police and the doctors came to take his broken boy away, he whispered quietly in his son's ear, the last thing he had said to him before he'd stormed off for the last time. "No matter what, Virgilio. No matter what." \n\n"You are still my son.""

hotautumn.45.d:0 "Virgilio's lower lip trembled as the words hung in the air. He spoke softly, almost as if recoiling from their own message. "I... Don't know if I deserve it." He admitted, quietly, with a choked voice and downcast eyes. \n\nNeither party was quite sure when they had transitioned into an embrace, or who stepped into the other first, but with a face buried in his father's shoulder, Virgilio let out a scream, muffled by the suit and shoulder. It was a scream of years lost, a scream that expelled and breathed out his hatred he held deep inside, a scream that banished the rage and violence that he had allowed to permeate to his core. \n\nHis father hugged him all the tighter in response, and after a few seconds that lasted an eternity, he slowly led Virgilio into his home- their home. After leaving the pale-faced, tear-eyed youth on a chair, his father prepared a kettle of tea for the two of them, and they continued to speak. \n\n"I don't know where to continue from here." Virgilio admitted, staring at the steam rising from his cup. "I feel as though I unleashed a monster, and now all I can do is watch as it destroys that which I tried to save." \n\nHis father sat and nodded as his son spoke. "As always, your trail is your own to blaze. But if you want my advice..." He began breathing in deep as he set aside an empty cup. "Follow some of your own." \n\n"I... Don't underst-" \n\n"Back before you left." He interrupted, leaning over the table emphatically. "Back before you well and truly lost your way, we'd often argue, and you often told me that when evil rose, it was the duty of good men to stand against it, that anything else only abetted such evils, yes?" He leaned back. "If you unleashed this beast of hatred, of rage and violence, then if you are to start being a good man, it is up to you to stand against it." \n\n"I don't think I can, the barricade is still up and there are many more of them than there are of me." Virgilio rubbed an arm uncertainly as he spoke, in spite of the heat. \n\n"Words, Virgilio, are action." His father declared emphatically. "Violence does not cure violence, so perhaps it's time for you to give the strength of words instead of fists." \n\nVirgilio mulled that over in his head a few times after hearing that, and his brows knit in determination as the vision grew clearer. He knew what he had to do."

hotautumn.46.t:0 "A Whimpering Flame"
hotautumn.46.d:0 "For the first time in recent memory, Virgilio saw the world with clear eyes. And when he saw the world around the barricade, he saw madness. Slogans and chants were being thrown across between the Socialist protesters and the fascist barricade, threats of violence and denunciations filled the air, and what once sounded sweet to the ear had a harshness to it that he couldn't detect before. \n\nA deep breath in through the nose and out through the mouth, Virgilio steeled himself as he snuck his way around the protesters to return to the barricade, where he was greeted with shouts of approval and ecstatic greetings from his comrades. \n\n"Virgilio! What took you so long? We had thought you might have fled! Glad to see we are wrong!" \n\n"The reds are growing agitated out there, have you heard anything that can help us?" \n\n"What is the nation saying about this? Are they rallying behind our example?" \n\nVirgilio tugged at his shirt collar for a moment, and spoke slowly and with a measured tempo. "The nation remains as divided as ever." He admitted, glancing at the faces of his compatriots. It was clearly not what they wanted to hear, they wanted to hear of a fascist nation, reinvigorated by their actions here. He'd have to lay it on thick. "Some think what we are doing here is admirable, while others scold us for our defiance and belligerence." \n\n"But surely, we are doing good work here, right Virgilio? The ones who stand with us aren't sitting idle, right?" \n\nVirgilio's silence struck them more severely than any words could. Where once fiery, impassioned eyes once glared hatefully at the enemy across the way, now they glanced uncertainly between one another. They were looking for that fire, that fury that up to a few moments ago, they all shared. \n\nThere was none to be found."

hotautumn.47.d:0 "The world seemed to spin around the gathered students. Where once they could navigate the chaos and confusion of the times with the help of their firm faith in the Fascist ideals of yore, the foundation on which their strength was built was all at once rocked. \n\nThe uncertainty, the fear, the panic immediately set in. They looked to Virgilio for guidance, and he spoke with a resigned voice. "There's nothing for us here. When the sun sets, we can slip away, we can pretend like-" \n\n"Pretend like nothing happened, Virgilio? When did you turn so craven?" A voice piped up from behind him. He didn't recognize the man, but evidently the man recognized him. \n\n"I... Yes. I think it's pretty clear that-" \n\nThe man interrupted him, stepping between Virgilio and the other students. "Pretty clear that your belly is weak and your spirit quails in the wake of challenge. You want to know why no one has rallied? Because all we've done is hide behind wood and stone!" \n\nOnce again, Virgilio could feel his blood rise and the bile build up in his throat. But this wasn't like before, it was different on some level he couldn't quite identify. "And what would you propose instead?" \n\nThe provocateur shot a fist up into the air. "We take the fight to the Communists! We rush the reds, prove our valor, and drive them off before us! Then all Italy will see that she still has strength!" \n\nIt was strange. He'd said much the same before and often, had he sounded so deluded before? How many people must have written him off as a madman? How many people might have been right to do so? \n\nVirgilio glanced over towards the rest of the students and sighed. "This was a mistake. All of this. Those of you with something to live for, come with me." He turned and began to walk, and could hear the meek shuffling of feet, about half of those gathered, he reckoned. \n\n"And those of us with something to fight for will stay! Go home you old women, to your knitting and rocking chairs! Us men will fight for you even still." The remaining half turned and went back to the palisade."

It wasn't even particularly close either, against the socialists' overwhelming numbers and the police with their riot gear and their batons, spirit proved to be of little use as a weapon or as armor. \n\nIt was them, the true Sons of Italy, the salvation of the nation and those who carried the spirit of Mussolini with them, who sulked away from the battle. For now, they had no choice but to hide their shame and the humiliation of their failure here. \n\nBut that was only for the time being. The fascists would hide their face, they'd slink off, but they'd go home. They'd reflect on their defeat here, and if their spirits didn't quail, it would be a source of rage, of fury, fuel for the fire in the belly. \n\nThey'd take that with them to their dorms, to their homes, their villages and their communities. It would burn inside of them, and it would serve as a hundred beacons for those with a similar spirit, a familiar rage as the bloodied Fascists. \n\nLet the reds celebrate for now, they can have their repetitive songs and girlish dances. While they're patting themselves on the back, the Blackshirts will nurse their wounds and prepare for the next round. They will learn from their mistakes and be more prepared for whenever the next confrontation occurs, in whatever form it does. \n\nAt least, that's the hope anyways."

hotautumn.49.t:0 "A Day at the University"
hotautumn.49.d:0 "Virgilio Inceli awoke, looked out the window of his dorm, groaned, and felt angry. \n\nIt was unseasonably warm for this late in the year, and the poorly ventilated dorm was baking. Of course it wouldn't matter if there was any money in the school budget for some half decent air conditioning, but there wasn't. The school probably had wasted all the money on keeping the union workers happy, and the economy had been in the trash since the democratic transition anyway. \n\nHe got dressed, and walked to his first class, History of Italian Politics. The professor was a degenerate, a coward, probably a secret communist, and worst of all, a woman.  Inceli thought about her, and he felt hateful. \n\nOn his way, a group of radical students was holding a demonstration in the main university thoroughfare. Their proud red banners caught the sunlight as they strutted back and forth, and they had a partisan sort of bravery about them as they chanted slogans. If Virgilio had been with his friends, brave companions of the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale, they would have chased the leftists back to their hidey holes. But they were busy, and he was alone, so he slunk away and proceeded. \n\nIt wasn't that Virgilio Inceli was reluctant to join in the struggle for national redemption-- it's just that he was indecisive. Many of his fellows were meeting with the national organization, trying to persuade the Blocchi Nazionali to find its balls. They had asked him to come, and he had demurred. They had had high hopes for Almirante. He had been a rising star in the PNF before its dissoltion but now he seemed nothing more than a tired old man... Others were at the new front, fighting the new battle with sticks and rocks against the communists and their police collaborators. \n\nAs Virgilio Inceli joined the class, his thoughts were still on the strikes, the meeting, and the future of the nation. But they strayed from this as well, and moved on to other things. Feelings he had half forgotten. A home, a father who didn't understand. Having comrades, but not friends. And as the class came to its end, and Virgilio Inceli stood at the building's threshold, struggling to make a decision, he felt lonely."

hotautumn.50.d:0 "Home for Inceli was a quiet middle class district on Milan's outskirts. It wasn't a long trip, but he took his time nonetheless. \n\nVirgilio had been surprised at how easily his compatriots in FUAN had accepted his departure. He had expected that they would plead for him to stay -- to accompany the leadership to Rome and the BN meeting, or to the barricades to strike down the Bolshevik protestors. But they had accepted his flimsy excuses with a smile and a wave. Perhaps they had never put as much faith in his leadership as he thought. \n\nHe'd show them. He'd show everyone. His father would be the first -- he'd see the error of his ways, and by tomorrow he'd be with them at the barricades. DC, CISL, all the spineless traitors, would be neutered, and Inceli would get the credit for destroying one of the three loathsome oppressors of the Italian people. \n\nVirgilio thought back to their last conversation when he told his father he'd joined the FUAN. He'd expected him to be proud, hadn't he always said that Socialism would be the first thing to destroy Italy? Hadn't he, like any good citizen, had a poster of Il Duce on their dining room wall? But FatherFirst Inceli had changed. He had been infected by the same weakness that permeated the rest of the nation. \n\nSo father and son had parted in rage and tears, one to join the most effeminate and corrupt of unions, the other to join the bold youth restoring the nation to greatness. It didn't matter. Inceli would show him. This time, with the streets filled with fire and radicals, he'd have no choice but to see the light. \n\nThe train pulled into the station, and Virgilio Inceli stepped off shivering slightly, undoubtedly from the excitement of teaching his father the truth of the National Revolution. Or perhaps the cold."

hotautumn.51.d:0 "It was a long bus ride to Rome, and a longer wait as the BN's security checked and double-checked Virgilio Inceli's clearance. \n\nWhen at last he was reunited with his comrades in the FUAN, it was a while after noon and Virgilio Inceli was thoroughly agitated. This was, it must be noted, not entirely to his detriment, as the FUAN was the sort of organization where furious agitation paid silver. Gold, if it was particularly insipid furious agitation, rooted in the general angst of everyday life and directed at the "enemies", whoever that might be at any particular time. \n\nFUAN, or at least the significant portion of its central committee present that the meeting, was a place of speeches, a place of rage and rabble rousing, a place of daring political maneuvers against the vile enemies of the Italian nation. These usually ranged from the traitors and cowards in Rome, vilified from a safe distance in the organization's weekly newsletter, to the on-campus radicals and leftists, enemies of all decent people and positively destroyed and eviscerated regularly by the scathing cartoons drawn by second-year Mario Salvini, often accompanied by Inceli's scathing editorials. \n\nBut the FUAN was more than just a group of noisy kids. They were the forefront of the national revolution. They were the Italian future. Their actions were more than just pranks and name-calling, they were bold moves to defend the people. \n\nAnd they were more than just pranks and name-calling. More often than not, when a strike escalated into violence, it was FUAN on the front lines. When heads needed to be kicked in, FUAN was the steel toed boot that did the job. There were whispers that some of their radical members had bought arms illegally, and were willing to use them.

hotautumn.52.d:0 "In the city of Rome, birthplace of European civilization, there was a building. The building was owned by the Blocchi Nazionali, a party that stood for the defense of Italian civilization, nationalism and democracy hand in hand, and definitely not Fascism. \n\nIt was not a grand building. On the outside it wasn't nearly as impressive as the concrete behemoth that served as the party's headquarters near the cities center. This building was made out of cracked brick, and graffitied heavily by all varieties of dissident ne'er do-wells.  The inside similarly lacked the many creature comforts of the BN headquarters, being notably devoid of the in-house bars and smoke rooms that the BN's main locus' spartan exterior hid so well. \n\nStill, it was a building that the party put to good use. There were leaflets not yet ready for release that needed storage, certain items devoted party loyalists which were...inappropriate to store in a public place, and meetings that might be best kept out of the view of the commons. It was for this purpose that the building was used one warm fall day, as representatives from the BN's central committee met with the "grand council" of the Front of National Action of University Students. \n\nThe room was uncomfortably warm, and with great reluctance the students removed their black jackets. A few of them had sewn in small Fasces or depictions of Mussolini onto the breast pockets, and they grew glum as they discarded the wonderful attempt to challenge the BN's transition to non-fascism. \n\nThe BN representatives were, for the most part, exactly as Virgilio Inceli had expected. A bunch of old men in suits who harrumphed at the most mild suggestions of direct action, and wrung their hands in response to the FUAN's zeal. \n\nThe meeting also went about as well as he had thought it would. The FUAN proposed a direct series of counter-demonstrations against the counter demonstrations, and the BN looked shiftily from side to side. The FUAN demanded permission to openly use the words "communist", "bolshevik", "traitorous", and "bourgeois" in referring to their mutual enemies. The BN fiddled with their ties. The FUAN wanted the BN to formally support their right to use violence in self defence, the BN declared that it was time for a lunch break. \n\nWhen they returned, Inceli decided he had enough of this. It was time to bring matters to a head, and find out where the party's true loyalties lay. He cleared his throat and began to speak."

Even his compatriots on the FUAN side of the table seemed embarrassed. As the silence following Virgilio's pronouncement grew, they glanced at his hands, his feet, anywhere but his eyes, wide and scared, or the red pouring into his face. \n\nThen the uncomfortable silence was broken by applause. \n\nFrom the far end of the BN's side of the table there was one man, who while equal to the others in age and demeanor, differed from them radically in appearance. He wore a tight black turtleneck, somehow more imposing then the student's black leather. On his lapel, he wore not just the fasces but also the knife and skull. it was he who applauded, his hands meeting in sarcastic enthusiasm, the cruel lines of his face wrinkled in enthusiasm. When he spoke, the other BN reacted with curious mixtures of exasperation. \n\n"Absolutely! These youngsters might need some guidance, but they've got the right idea! The nation has gone to hell, and we need their vigor to bring it back. Believe, Obey, and Fight, that's what we need! We need to meet violence with violence." \n\nThe stunned silence returned, but before the students could react, one of the suits spoke in a tone of crisp dismissal. \n\n"The meeting is done. We appreciate the work of the FUAN, but we must ask you to vacate party premises immediately." \n\nMoments later Virgilio Inceli and the others were outside the building, a few of their jackets left behind in the haste of failure. The morning heat had evaporated, and fat mournful droplets had begun to fall from the sky. \n\nInceli supposed that he should feel angry. That he rally his compatriots against the weak and traitorous BN and their hollow bourgeois democracy they supported. But he felt only sadness of failure, and only disappointment in their eyes."

The contrarian lunatics who cling to every patriotic organization like mussels to a whale. The ones who spoke admiringly of Farinacci, of Hitler, even of the "discipline" of Burgundy. A few of them had somehow wormed their way into leadership in the FUAN, and when they received the letters no one spoke out, because after all, they were lunatics. Then it was the spineless. The ones who sought ever greater power for themselves, and were willing to ally with anyone and say anything to increase their own power. They would in one meeting make bold claims of the violence necessary for the restoration of Italian strength, and in another wring their hands about every scrape and bruise the FUAN meted out to its bolshevist rivals. When they received the letters of dismissal no one spoke out, because they were weak. Inceli had let himself hope then that the BN had some potential afterall, that they were merely acting to refocus its sister student organization, and that any day now they'd apologize for their conduct at the meeting and invite the remaining leadership back for further planning. But then it was the honorable. The true scions of Italian Nationalism, the ideological heirs of Mussolini, who sought to once more raise the people's patriotic consciousness and shephard in a return to glory. When the letters came for them, there was no one left to speak out. No leadership council to speak of except for the BN's puppets and toadies. \n\nVirgilio read the words one more time, his vision blurred with tears of rage. "While the leadership of the Blocchi Nazionali appreciates your contribution to the nationalist student movement, we have decided it is for the benefit of the movement for you to vacate your leadership position immediately." \n\nHe threw the letter aside. He would fight them. He'd go around the city, find all the representatives of past and present and rally them to action. FUAN's ex-leadership was rapidly accumulating an alphabet soup of splinter groups. Inceli would be their unifier. They'd go to the BN's offices and MAKE them see the way. \n\nIt would fail. They'd be arrested. There was nothing he could do. \n\nThe national students movement was defeated. He could do nothing. \n\nHe had failed."

hotautumn.55.t:0 "They're Not on Their Side"
hotautumn.55.d:0 ""You are either with us, in our fight against Bolshevism, or against us." \n\nThe silence from the BN's side of the table was all that Inceli needed to know that his words had had the desired effect. It was a hungry sort of silence. An expectation. The sort that waits for more. \n\nVirgilio lowered his voice, making it quite, conspiratorial, dangerous, intimate: "We want the same thing. A free Italy. A strong Italy. We have made mistakes -- I am the first to admit it. But our enemies outnumber us ten to one, and have foreign support as well. If we are to triumph, it must be all of us together. It is either unity, or death." \n\nHe had them. A few of the oldest and slimiest representatives writhed in their seats, but they were by far a minority. One member of the party -- seated on the edge of the table and wearing the famous black turtleneck and pin of the MSVN went so far as to chuckle appreciatively. \n\nThen the center most delegate spoke: "Well... I think we should be able to arrange a meeting with our senior leadership. We'll let you know when." \n\nPart of Inceli wondered if this might be a trick, if the call would never come -- but it did. \n\nThe meeting was late at night, and at a mansion not a dodgy, crumbling office. The best the party had to offer. It was roses and chandeliers for the FUAN this time, not cracked streets and broken windows. They filed past well equipped security guards and into an office decked with splendor, complete with marble pillars and plush leather chairs. \n\nAnd there in the middle, Almirante. \n\nInceli had had doubts about the BN leader's sincerity before, but seeing him in the flesh, he knew that they were mistaken. The chairman was somehow wise as well as bold, kind and yet fierce. When he asked, softly but firmly for the FUAN's loyalty, Inceli was only too willing to give it. \n\nItaly would be strong again. Italy would be great again. The nation would rise once more, with Almirante at its head."

hotautumn.56.t:0 "Dead Silence"
hotautumn.56.d:0 "The change didn't come all at once, nor was it so abrupt and dramatic as to be all that noticeable unless one was paying close attention to the state of FUAN as a whole. It was for just that reason that Inceli thought little of it when the local block leader and known provocateur actually spoke out in favor of a more moderate approach like the BN had been pushing for. When he saw that the man was perspiring a great deal, he put it down to some fair weather cold. \n\nHe didn't notice when the recruiter stopped haranguing non-members about the "Bolshevik menace" and "red terror"; he didn't notice when the district representative began to extort the position of the BN men and began to turn on his former allies, branding them, "Extremists who threaten to besmirch our message." He had no way to see how much healthier the representative's bank account had suddenly become, no way to see the bruises on the recruiters' sides. \n\nHe took notice when, almost overnight, the secretary for the FUAN branch of the city of Rome changed his position on working with the BN. Where he had only a few hours ago railed against the proposed rollback of aggression against suspected and known communist groups and individuals, he was now delivering a speech on the benefits of working with the established party to convince the people that Communism was not the answer to their problems. With horror Inceli began to remember every small hint, every change in behavior, every temper that had recently seemed to cool. He had taken it for granted that the last true believers of FUAN would hold firm against those who wished to use the name and legacy of fascism for their own selfish ends. He had been mistaken, and with every day passed, he could see that the rot of BN was ensnaring more and more prominent members of the leadership. He felt shame and disgust well up inside him, alongside the bitter taste of defeat. It was time to go back to the university, there was nothing he could do now."

hotautumn.57.d:0 "Milan is a city that has inspired many a poem and song throughout the ages, of its beauty and grandeur. But alas, the age of fascism had not been kind to the Moral Capital of Italy. Its golden cathedrals had gone to rust, its quaint homes and outlying villages replaced by endless blocks of unchanging apartments. \n\nIt was to this city, static but surviving, that a train rolled into one Tuesday night. Its occupants filed out heads hung low, exhausted from their trip and the failures they had experienced in its duration. \n\nBut, despite their bad news and long faces, they were greeted at the university with a hero's welcome. Inceli quickly found himself surrounded by a crowd of admirers and a bottle of wine pressed into his hands as they urged him to recount the details of his trip to Rome. In the haze of good drink and companionship, the details of the trip began to change in his mind. The BN's attitude was not defeat -- it was merely a setback! The FUAN was not broken, it was merely reorganizing to rise again! \n\nInceli listened to his friends and spoke to them in turn. They spoke of the grandeur that Italy lost -- and would no doubt regain. All of the undesirables that filled the streets like rats would be cleansed. The legions of Rome would march once more into the world, to firmly discipline the traitors and barbarians that threatened its conquests. \n\nThere, surrounded by his partners in heroic struggle, listening to a drunk first-year rambling about a group called the "nuclear army" or somesuch, Inceli felt content."

hotautumn.58.d:0 "Though it would continue de jure for some more time, the FUAN was dead. Some of its members largely drifted into the BN's better organized and officially sponsored groups. Others dropped out of their campaign for a "National Revolution" entirely, as if awaking from a bad dream. \n\nSome, however, took a different path. \n\nItaly's universities had always had their share of graffiti artists, one could find tags, hammers, fasces and sickles a plenty, but these days hardly a stretch of wall or bathroom stall could be found that wasn't decorated with swastikas. In some places, it wasn't the negligent art of malcontents, but intricate murals of bright futures and desolate wastelands alike, with a curious pagan symbol in place of the sun. \n\nThe FUAN was dead, but the dream of its members and their romantic quest for an Italy that never was had never been stronger.  It was a dream that grew more radical and dangerous by the day as its members found ever more energetic channels with which to express their beliefs. \n\nIf they could not have the Italy they wanted -- the respected great power and prosperous fascist economy still described in too many textbooks -- then they would have no Italy at all. From the ashes it would arise again, better and stronger. A golden eagle unleashed upon the world."

hotautumn.59.t:0 "A Schorching Morning"
hotautumn.59.d:0 "Of all the things Virgilio Inceli hated, being late for anything neared the top of that list. He hated how it reflected poorly on himself and invited judgement, even when it wasn't his fault in any way. Like this morning, when his usual route to the headquarters was disrupted by the prancing and shrill shouting of protestors. \n\nBeing late also meant he had to endure the slight of the meeting already having begun by the time he arrived. He had to pretend like nothing was wrong when his arrival prompted everyone else to turn and greet him, interrupting their discussion with empty pleasantries and mocking smiles, all the way until Virgilio took his seat. \n\nConsidering the circumstances, Virgilio was none too pleased to realize that they were planning demonstrations of their own. \n\n"Is this what we're reduced to? Pickets and slogans?" \n\nIt was telling just how eager his comrades were to justify their decision. "Don't think of it like that. Think of it like this instead:" \n\nAnother cut in, as if they'd rehearsed the damn thing. "We can only benefit by playing along with the democrats for the time being. We have- as it stands- something of a public image issue, and if we show ourselves to be reasonable and willing to work with the system that we have now, we can start to repair that image." \n\nAnother piped up. "How can the media slander us and call us thugs and brutes if we're out there with signs and protesting peacefully like the rest, after all?" \n\nVirgilio's arms were crossed over his chest, and he slouched some in his chair as they made their case. He didn't like it any more than he did at the start, but he had to admit that the plan had some merit. Not a great deal, but some. \n\n"I'll... Bow to your collective wisdom. So, what's the plan then?" \n\nThe speaker practically beamed as he was allowed to continue. "I was just saying that I've spoken with the police. They'll form a perimeter to-" \n\n"The police?" Virgilio's voice betrayed more of his incredulity than he'd meant to. \n\n"Yes, the police. As we said, we're trying to appear legitimate and law-abiding. They can both protect us if the communists try to antagonize us. They'd be willing to fight us alone, but riot cops with shields and batons? They wouldn't have the balls." \n\nHe went back to detailing the intricate details of their little protest, and Virgilio was left slinking further into his chair."

hotautumn.60.d:0 "The field of battle was ready. The forces stood ready with their banners and flags, their helmets and weapons, their ranks and files. The only thing that was missing was a war and an enemy to fight. \n\nIt would only be a slight exaggeration to say that the FAUN students were as heavily armed as their protectors that day, batons rested lazily in their hands as their helmeted heads looked up towards their speaker- the second of the evening- in a manner that reminded one more of soldiers standing at attention than students listening to a speaker at a political rally. \n\nThe speaker moved and spoke with a kind of energy and bombast that seemed familiar to many, including most of the police who served as the rally's protective cordon. As he continued, Inspector Ovidio turned towards Inspector Constantini and whispered with all the subtlety of a tank. \n\n"Where'd the kids find this one anyways?" He remarked, narrowing his eyes skeptically towards the stage. "He's good. Looks professional too. I had kind of assumed one of them would be up there, not someone who looks like he could sit in Parliament." \n\nConstantini tilted his head and tapped his own chin lightly with his own baton. "I've seen him before, I think." He muttered idly. "He does a lot of these speeches, I've walked by him before on my way home." \n\nThey were joined by an unexpected third voice, that of one of FUAN's student leaders, Virgilio Incelli, had moved his way towards the rear and apparently overheard them. "That's Pino Romualdi, he's from the BN, try to show a little respect." \n\nOvidio shrugged nonchalantly, seeming to not even notice the student's aggressive body language and tone. "He's just a speaker. Trying too hard to look and sound like the old Duce too. Someone should tell him he has a microphone and doesn't need to yell so loudly." \n\n"Well... Maybe it's inherited." Came Incelli's sullen retort. He was about as eager to explain as they were to ask, which wasn't at all. So he pivoted quickly. "Besides, maybe if you two listened to his words instead of his volume, you'd learn a thing or two about strength." \n\nConstantini felt an eye twitch involuntarily. "Maybe he could use some of that strength to tell us before he shows up unannounced next time. The speeches were supposed to be over by now." \n\nHe felt an instant sense of regret for having said that, but that was nothing compared to the look of abject hatred that young Incelli offered him instead..."

hotautumn.61.d:0 "In that moment, Incelli simply stopped thinking. He would allow raw instinct take over, all the thinking in the world had only produced a farce, but now he'd produce action. He stormed up to the Inspector, and shoved him backwards. "And what do you care? Huh? Go up there, go stop him." \n\nThe Inspector was caught off guard by the display and wasn't prepared to respond when two more officers from the cordon stepped forward, placing themselves between the student and Constantini with their batons brandished. \n\nBy now the scene had captured the attention of all of those gathered, the speaker was talking to part of his own personal security, while the fascist students stood behind Virgilio, who stared between the two officers. One of them held out a hand and simply demanded that the young man hand over his baton. \n\nIt all happened so fast, the sound of a baton's crack against flesh and bone, the immediate roar of approval from the fascistic students, the cries and shouts of dismay from the officers, the sound of rushing boots across the cobblestones and the sidewalks. The officer who had demanded the baton clutched his snapped forearm against his chest, but soon enough, there would be too much going on to help the poor man. \n\nAll across the square, Incelli's comrades surged forward and followed his example, the police had expected some hostility, but quickly, the situation spun out of their control. On all sides, students and police officers wrestled and charged with batons in hand, the sounds of violence as varied as it was bloody spilling into the streets around them."
hotautumn.61.a:0 "This is out of control..."

hotautumn.62.t:0 "Charge"
hotautumn.62.d:0 "The police, in spite of the surprise of the sudden charge of the students, held their own in the ensuing scattered fights around the block. Only a small number had fallen, most often to head blows and arms struck by batons, while they continued to hold against their assaulters. \n\nAs for the students, for all of their ferocity and their zeal, they were still students and not fighters. As soon as they had rushed the officers, some were already falling back, while others had rushed the exact opposite direction, towards the stage that the politicians and speakers had already vacated. Few paid them any sort of mind, however, as the battle raged, and the tide began to shift. \n\nThe better-equipped and more well-prepared forces of the police began to, one by one, drive off their attackers. The handful who had fallen to blows to the head, arms, and bellies were dragged behind the cars, and now it was starting to become the police who chased the protestors and not the other way around. \n\nAs if the situation hadn't gotten bad enough for the FUAN, the din of the fighting was quickly drowned out by the roar of engines, the pressure of tires on cobblestone, and the rumble of armored vans storming into the square. \n\nThe panic quickly mounted among the students, but to their credit, they did not merely flee and disperse. Instead, they turned and they rallied, back to where the students who had turned back earlier had run to. When they emerged from behind the stage, they had discarded their batons and now their blood-caked knuckles carried pistols and rifles in their steads. \n\nSoon, the streets would ring with the song of gunfire."

hotautumn.63.t:0 "Chaos"
hotautumn.63.d:0 "The square looked empty, save for the half-collapsed wooden stage and the armored cars and vans that formed a perimeter of safety for the officers. Crouched behind the protective vehicles, the police officers formulated a plan to drive out the students from the square and restore order. \n\nThe students whose presence they felt, but they could not see. Scattered among the buildings in the square, behind trees and within bushes, the rebellious students held their rifles and pistols close to their chest. From their hiding positions, they watched the semicircle of armored vehicles and waited, fingers and feet drumming impatiently against walls, cobbles, trees, and their weapons. \n\nTheir patience frayed. Plans came to fruition. The silence of the square was filled with tension and unease, and both parties waited for the other to make the first move. The silence was first disturbed, but not broken, by jeers, shouts, and insults from one side to the other, but still, the tension did not break. That didn't happen until the first gunshot. \n\nIt was impossible to tell whose gun fired first, but the result was all the same. The boots of the law stormed the square, and the amateur shots of the students filled it with the song of gunfire. Lead cracked and splintered against the road and sidewalks, as officers fired back against students and into the shadows. \n\nIn groups of two and three, police moved through the square and the storm of bullets that filled the air around them. The fight would need to take place building by building, tree by bush by shrub. The work has only begun, and already there were grunts and shouts of pain as the bullets found their marks regardless."

hotautumn.64.t:0 "Death"
hotautumn.64.d:0 ""Stay close." Ovidio muttered as the two of them proceeded cautiously deeper into the alley. The Inspectors had their pistols drawn and held at the ready, pointed down by their legs as they tread further and further from the safety perimeter. "Don't want to fuck it up in the final moments, right?" He offered Constantini an unconvincing smile. \n\nThe operation was in fact, wrapping up. The absolute overkill that the police forces had brought into the square meant that the poorly armed and untrained students couldn't hold out forever. Rather than facing arrest, most of them had fled, though it was noted that there were a number of students who were staying and taking potshots at the officers who remained. \n\nInspector Ovidio had sworn up and down that he'd seen a shape rush from some of the brush and into an alley straddling the square that the broken-up demonstrations had taken place in. So far, there wasn't much to suggest that anyone had been down this way, but if there was one thing these militant students were good at, it was hiding. Maybe Constantini would have a joke for that if they weren't also armed. "Keep your voice down. Echoes." \n\nConstantini's eyes scanned the walls and windows above as he proceeded, now alone against an unknown for. Slow, measured movements from one windowsill caused the Inspector to jump, turning his pistol skywards. \n\nThe cat on the sill stopped in the middle of its grooming, its leg high in the air and feline eyes glaring judgmentally down to the officer. Constantini lowered his pistol, and gave a slight chuckle. He must be losing his- \n\nThe sound of the gunshot and the crack of a bullet against cobblestone blended with one another, but he didn't have time to consider that before the sharp, shattering pain struck him in the side of his knee. He fell with a shout that must've been audible as far as the Vatican. He could just barely register the pain when his head struck the wall. \n\nOvidio was saying something as he cradled Constantini's collapsing form, but he couldn't quite hear it. Even as blood ran from his head and onto Ovidio's leg and the cobbles beneath, Constantini couldn't keep from chuckling.  \n\n"It was just a cat, Ovidio." He laughed, his voice weakening by the moment. He got the last word in, "Just... a dumb cat..." before his chuckles faded into a rattle."

hotautumn.65.t:0 "Silence"
hotautumn.65.d:0 "Before turning away and rejoining the rest of the students to watch out the remainder of Romualdi's speech. Eventually, the man's speech would run its course, and while he offered one final call to action to his steadfast audience, there was a sense of palpable relief that washed over both Student and Officer. \n\nQuickly- with perhaps a bit more haste than considered polite- the police went into formation to provide an escort for the FUAN students to leave the square. Curiously, however, the students didn't only take their time getting ready, they didn't seem to really be moving or preparing much at all. The gathered audience, even as Romualdi and the other speakers prepared to go on their way, just stayed and milled about listlessly in the square. \n\nInspector Constantini peered at the sun that threatened to set behind the horizon, and then back to the formed line of officers. Letting his shoulders slink, he nodded to himself before walking up and towards the gathered students. He reached out to tap the shoulder of the nearest one, and once again, was met with the scornful gaze of Virgilio Incelli. \n\n"Mister Incelli." Constantini maintained an even, diplomatic tone to his voice, though he suspected his face betrayed how tired he was at this point. "The cordon is ready to escort you and your compatriots out of the square, we were wondering when-" \n\n"That won't be necessary." Came the curt reply of Virgilio, cutting off the officer and leaving both silent as the Inspector processed what had just happened. Virgilio gave a brief glance back to his fellow students who didn't know what game Virgilio was playing.  Not that he could blame them, he didn't know what he was trying to accomplish, save for stepping on the pig's toes. \n\n"Not necessary?" Constantini tilted his head towards the youth. A way out if he wanted to take it, but the offer only emboldened young Incelli. \n\n"Entirely unnecessary. We're not leaving. Our point has not yet been made." He crossed his arms and maintained eye contact with Constantini. "Feel free to go home yourselves, however. We can handle ourselves without you." \n\nWith a deep sigh and a shrug, Inspector Constantini turned back towards the cordon. He was going to require a few more opinions on this..."

hotautumn.66.t:0 "Fear"
hotautumn.66.d:0 ""They're students. Practically children. If they don't want to move, then make them move. You're police, act like it damn it." \n\nThat response wasn't what Constantini had wanted to hear from headquarters. He had hoped that the chief might be willing to negotiate with them, but the terms were clear. This disorderly behavior went beyond the protections of their right to gather together and right to protest, and they would just have to obey. \n\n"Well, they came prepared. If we're going to force them to go anywhere, we're going to need some backup..." \n\nThe FUAN on the other hand, was not of a mind to negotiate, nor were they of a mind to obey. It had taken a bit of time, and more than a bit of reinforcing, fiery rhetoric to sway the other members of the FUAN over to his side. But in spite of their general spinelessness, Virgilio Incelli would gain ground. \n\n"It is about time we practiced a little of what we preached. It's time we showed these corrupt officials what Italian strength and spirit looks like in action!" Came his final rallying cry, met with the scattered shouts and hoots from the rest of the student body. He turned, and with the helmets and flags of the FUAN standing behind him, he faced the baton-wielding police officers. \n\n"Any chance you'll rethink this insanity?" Constantini offered one last time, an empty hand extended in a gesture of goodwill towards the man on the other side of the gap. "If you go now, there won't be any consequences. It'll be as if we parted ways the way we were supposed to." \n\nThis was met only with a shake of the head from Virgilio. "We will not back down." He opened his mouth to speak further, but was interrupted by the hum of engines and the sound of tires over cobblestone as armored vehicles moved in to surround the square. \n\nThe gathered students took a tentative half-step back at the sound of the armored cars, but before Incelli could reply to the display, he was interrupted again by the whirring of rotors. \n\nConstantini squinted up towards the heavens, and muttered to himself with great incredulity in his voice. "...The machine gun might be overkill...""
hotautumn.66.a:0 "This has certainly escalated."

hotautumn.67.t:0 "Retreat"
hotautumn.67.d:0 "The field of battle was ready. The forces stood ready with their banners and flags, their helmets and weapons, their ranks and files. The only problem now was that the helmet, flag and baton stood across from armored cars, a helicopter, and machine guns. \n\n"Virgilio. Please." Came the last plea from Inspector Constantini, he had set down his own baton, though the gesture was awfully futile seeing as his words were still backed up by machine guns. "Just stand down." \n\nVirgilio looked towards the Inspector, and then back over his shoulder. He looked towards the rest of the FUAN, the fear on their faces as they watched the helicopter hover in the air, and the officers began to take cover behind the cars, discarding batons for firearms. \n\nConstantini looked back over his own shoulder, towards the questioning and uncertain faces of the security cordon. Would they have the bellies to fire on these students? Would the students actually be stupid enough to fight? He watched a man silently remove the magazine from his pistol, thinking that no one was watching, and he watched another consciously move to the side to create an avenue. \n\nTension filled the air, and all that it waited for was a single twitch, an errant movement, a single spark to set off the entire scene. But what it got instead, was the clatter of a stick against the cobbles, at the feet of Virgilio Incelli. \n\nHe had made a big show of casting down the weapon, before turning back towards his compatriots, who all at once filled the square with the noise of dropping wood, and the furling up of flags and banners. Some who stood without their weapons chose to cast down their helmets or throw off their gloves and armbands instead. \n\n"I think..." He began, projecting his voice to the gathered students. "We have made our point. The sun is setting, let's go home, before the keepers of the peace escalate the scene further." The venom in his voice could be felt throughout the square, even as officers backed off and away."

hotautumn.68.t:0 "Quiet"
hotautumn.68.d:0 "The mood in the FUAN headquarters was noticeably depressed when the rest of the leadership slinked in and found their chairs. Virgilio had been there for a short time, though he exaggerated his lounging position to make it look like he had been waiting for much longer. When they walked in, he slowly lowered his boots from the desk and leaned upright, hands folded over the table. \n\n"To say that did not go according to plan would be an understatement." Virgilio began, to the lukewarm mutterings of agreements from the rest of those in attendance. \n\n"Our image is going to take a while to recover." One of them replied. \n\nAnother spoke up as well. "And there's no way the police are going to allow us any more public gatherings after that display." He shook his head, practically trembling in anger. "And the media is already slandering us, as if we had been the ones responsible for-" \n\n"What has happened, has happened." Virgilio sighed, placing his hands on the desk and rising from his chair. "We can't change it, whether the demonstrations were a bad idea from the start or a good idea simply turned ill is entirely immaterial. What matters now..." He pointed a finger to the desk to emphasize his speech. "Is where we go from here." The gathered leaders fell silent as Virgilio did. They glanced between each other, and eagerly searched the ceiling and floor for the ever-elusive answer to the question, the question that was eventually vocalized. "So... Where do we go from here?" Virgilio stood up and looked around at the sullen faces of his compatriots. "The way I see it, there are only two directions we can go. Either we can keep doing this... participation thing that the democrats want from us, until we fade into the margins of history books and soon, off their pages entirely..." \n\nHe paused for effect, and to allow the chance for the darkness on their faces to lift, replaced by rage and frustration, that twisted their visages. He held up a fist as he continued. "Or we can change our tactics. They want to use guns? We'll use guns. They want lead? We'll fill the streets with it. If Italy must bleed so she can live, then so be it, but we will not allow our nation to perish under the faltering gaze of limp-wristed bureaucrats and vampiric politicians." \n\nAll at once, depression gave way to anger, and anger gave way to resolve. As one, the leadership of the FUAN stood and gave a Roman Salute. For Virgilio. For the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale. For Italia."

The screams, bottles, rocks, slogans thrown at you, hammering against your body while your men, standing by your side, entirely depend on you for orders and instruction. Communists, fascists, united by their hatred for you. The adrenaline mounting, the heartbeat pounding like drums, the charges, the batons falling, the smell of tear gas and water cannons, shouted orders, the intoxicating miasma of violence. \n\nLiving like this is not easy, and the downtime can be the hardest part sometimes. Showing up at the local commissariato at the break of dawn, exchanging small talk with coworkers over a cup of coffee, the endless stashes of paperwork. And while Milan burned, its police officers slaved away at paperwork, like nothing of note was happening outside. The units of the police and the Carabinieri were stretched thin across the city - Bicocca, the industrial area, is still ablaze with constant strikes and small scale riots, while the Statale, much closer to the city centre has been recently pacified, but trouble is still brewing under the ashes. \n\nInspector Adriano Constantini looked away from the papers, out of the window on the streets. The sky of Milan had that soft azure hue, so typical of the Lombard landscape. Adriano picked up the cigarettes from the desk, right next to his badge, and lit up one, smoking in long, slow drags.

Constantini asked, flopping the dossier on the neighboring desk of Ovidio, another Inspector in the Celere Unit. He started awake, almost tipping over his lukewarm coffee at the sound of the paper meeting desk. \n\n"Oh, the strike?" Ovidio muttered, adjusting his glasses and wiping something from his mouth with a sleeve. \n\n"It says here that it's a uh... A demonstration." Constantini pointed out. "Why did we get switched over from the Pirelli?" \n\nOvidio shrugged as he looked over the dossier. "They can't call it a strike I guess, because they're students, not workers. Dunno who would panic about the books going unread for an evening, so they gotta give it a different name." He leaned back in his chair and handed the dossier back to Constantini. "They asked for a cordon last-second. I guess we were the only unit they could send." \n\nConstantini glowered down at the dossier and shook his head. "You'd think that a bunch of Fascists proclaiming their strength or whatever would handle their security themselves." Though as he spoke, he realized how glad he was that they weren't taking such matters into their own hands, for once. \n\nOvidio's reply mirrored his own internal dialogue. "Better us doing it than them. They're Nazis in all but name, they'd be certain to overreact if any of the Union men confronted them, and we'd have to go in anyway." He kicked his feet up on the desk, risking that lukewarm cup of coffee once more, and relaxed his hands behind his head. "Better we be there to keep the children from hurting themselves, am I right?" \n\n"I'm a police officer, not a babysitter." \n\n"You act like there's a difference.""

hotautumn.71.d:0 "Another day, another mountain of paperwork done, and yet the amount never seemed to end. Inspector Constantini put down the remnants of the last cigarette in the ashtray, letting out a long sigh. Days like these were boring, but a welcome moment of quiet after the chaos of the last period. As the inspector prepared to leave for home, the phone on his desk rang, echoing through the almost empty corridors of the local commissariat. \n\n"The orders have been changed, inspector Constantini" the voice on the other end of the line said. Receiving a direct call from the commissar was not a common occurrence, especially at such a late time of the hour. "Your men won't be needed at Pirelli tomorrow." A major strike was planned, and Constantini with his unit was supposed to be part of the security cordon. "Also, all documents regarding the Pirelli situation have been placed outside your clearance level." The call abruptly ended, and Constantini stood with the phone in his hand as it beeped, without even having the time of saying "yes, sir." \n\nThis was far from ordinary. The Celere Unit was never one devoted to investigation, and instead was the rank and file of the police - the grunts who do the dirty work. And yet, something went off in Constantini's mind. Why would the plans change, all of a sudden? And why remove dossiers that were commonly circulating until only hours ago? As Constantini was walking home, his mind raced. Perhaps it's nothing, but it might be worth asking around tomorrow at the commissariat."

hotautumn.72.d:0 "Inspector Constantini hung up the phone, and the room was once again filled with silence. And yet, his mind was racing, echoing with the voices he heard in the last round of phone calls. San Donato, Rogoredo, Sesto San Giovanni - from his colleagues and friends in almost every single working class district of Milan, similar news could be heard. Orders changing suddenly and seemingly with no rhyme or reason - experienced officers replaced with new people from outside the city - and the plans to contain the disorders, carefully crafted by the local commissars of the Polizia, being scrapped in favour of much more dubious ones. \n\nThe upper command of the Polizia proved its lack of competence or knowledge of the situation on the ground many times before, but such egregious mistakes were simply unprecedented. Constantini looked at the large map of Milan hanging in his office - a pentagon shaped mass of a city, apparently twisting and turning, its roads and streets intersecting at strange angles to mark where the many different overlords of Milan started to shape it in their image during the city's long history. All around the city centres, the districts where the strikes and disorders were most prominent, all marked in red, stretching like a ring of fire around the white blot in the city centre - the Duomo, San Babila, the Statale. \n\nThe current plan to deploy the police forces was a tragedy waiting to happen. The Celere units were ordered to take positions in bottlenecks and narrow streets, where there'd be no way to effectively contain the riots and a violent, head on clash would be inevitable. Somebody upstairs was doing his job outstandingly poorly, and something had to be done before the inevitable happened."

hotautumn.73.d:0 "Corruption in the police is a strange subject - even before that word appeared in Constantini's mind, the mere smell of that concept, its vague precognition, caused a sort of freeze reaction. And yet, there were few other explanations to the series of egregious mistakes the police command of Milan was committing, and none of them very plausible. Somebody, somewhere, was consciously and deliberately setting up a massacre in the streets of Milan, presumably with some sort of other goal. \n\nPolitics and police are a pairing which often made its appearance in some shape or form - but for the first time, inspector Constantini was directly involved. His men were on the front line in Milan - they would likely be the ones forced to kill, or be killed. And yet there was very little Constantini could do - the only things he had were rumours, conjectures, not conclusive evidence. And even then, what could a lowly inspector do against something happening above him in the chain of command? \n\nStill, another question was how and why somebody was trying to cause a violent escalation of the already tense situation in the city. The most obvious culprits would be the communists - by making violence increase, they could paint their own dead as martyrs and further gain popularity among the masses. But the police was not exactly known for its communist sympathies, and it could also be that some sort of right wing organization was attempting to cause the death of a policeman or two, in order to justify a harsher crackdown on leftist violence. It could even be organized crime, attempting to cause further chaos in order to keep the police busy, leaving them free to do their business. Or maybe it was all a complicated ploy by the police command, who was hoping to gain a martyr in order to be able to ask for more funding from the government. Constantini's mind buzzed with possibilities and conspiracies forming and dissolving in the span of seconds, against the backdrop of rising frustration, anger, and fear."

hotautumn.74.d:0 "Constantini turned off his tv, a cheap new model purchased by gutting his last paycheck, and drew a long sigh. Newspapers, from L'Unità to the Corriere, and RAI broadcasts over radio and televisions all told the same story. In the evening of yesterday, the police clashed with rioters and protesters in Sesto San Giovanni. Molotov cocktails and rocks were being hurled against the police like drops of rain, as what seemed like entire legions of angry, dispossessed workers, university aged would-be revolutionaries, and even women and children from the poor parts of Sesto pressed against the police. Eventually, the police was unable to contain the riot, and ordered a counter charge to repress the chaos. \n\nIt was like fingers snapping, and then for one second it was silence. Water cannons, tear gas, screams, batons falling on skulls - the police charged. Finally, gunfire. Policemen had opened fire on the crowd with live ammunition, leaving several people lying dead or wounded on the streets - and then, someone fired back. A policeman dropped to the ground, a puddle of blood forming around him as he wheezed his last breath while his comrades tried to remove him from the streets. More policemen were wounded, but at least the crowd was dispersed, as in what seemed like seconds the people fled in all directions, into buildings, narrow roads, and some seeming to vanish into thin air. Soon, only the macabre spectacle of a devastated street, with smoke, bodies, and burning cars, was left to the eye of the policemen, and of the press. \n\nAs predicted, the scandal was huge. Politicians from even the most unsuspectingly moderate parts of the political landscape were lamenting the deaths of so many people, and calling for more funds being directed towards the police and more extraordinary powers going their way. The most respectable members of the upper echelons of Italian high society were disgusted at the awful display of violence Italy had become a theater of, and wished for a return to orderly and quiet life in which workers and students would just behave like good citizens of the kingdom. The right wing was starting to openly remind the Italian people that things like these didn't happen in an earlier, more orderly time. And Constantini sat in his living room, staring at the ceiling, with that familiar buzzing sensation in his mind."

Under their stony visage, many had several emotions agitating their thoughts - anger, sadness, and a remarkable feeling that their friend's death was entirely avoidable. \n\nInspector Constantini was also present at the funeral, in his uniform, but far from the first rows of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie - going unnoticed among the crowd as Milan's archbishop delivered his somber sermon. While saddened by the death of his colleague, Constantini did not attend the funeral out of a desire to pay his respects, but for a more personal reason. He wished to meet an old friend of his - also an inspector, attached to the police unit present at the riot in Sesto San Giovanni. Perhaps he could give more answers. \n\nAs the archbishop gave his final blessings and the coffin was escorted out of the church, the crowd started to slowly disperse, piece by piece, in the busy, crowded streets of Milan. In the noise, Constantini managed to reach his friend, who had a stern look on his face. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, fitting for two old acquaintances meeting at a funeral, Constantini began asking questions - who gave the orders that resulted in a senseless death, and why? The answer he received was sobering, but not entirely unexpected."

hotautumn.77.t:0 "The Fires of Biocca"
hotautumn.77.d:0 "In normal times, the Bicocca district of Milan was surprisingly calm despite its industrial nature. It was filled with bustle but never raucous; echoing with thousands of the footsteps of laborers, young and old, but never so obnoxiously that it brought the storied city any shame. As the dawn began to shine upon the many steel and concrete beasts that housed the beating heart of the city's economy, there was, as usual, a fair amount of noise, but it was not the pleasant kind that indicated work was carrying on as usual. Instead, shouts of rage and the crackling of flame consumed this national center of educational and economic achievement. Such riots were all too common in these uncertain times, Inspector Constantini reflected as he deliberately adjusted the holster containing his standard-issued firearm for maximum visibility, but what worried the seasoned officer was the sheer scale of the conflagration that was currently consuming most of the quarter at the moment. The entire city's police force had been mobilized the previous night, and he had heard from a friend in the security ministry that special riot units were being deployed from as far away as Calabria to help suppress the riot before it became an even bigger embarrassment to the nation. \n\nNot that it would probably help much, the Inspector thought grimly as he stepped into a waiting car with a fellow inspector and a beat sergeant who explained that he had been called up to help direct the out of town reinforcements to their designated locations. \n\nThe trip to the edge of the riot was spent mostly in quiet, which was fine as far as Constantini was concerned, he wasn't really in the mood for talking. Only two incidents of note interrupted the drive. Above the background din of riotous jeers and the broadcast demands of the city and police officials, the crack of gunfire pierced through the morning air. The inspector vaguely remembered having been told that the rioters did not have any firearms. It seemed that supposition was now out of the window. The second incident did not involve gunfire, but was far more worrying in its own way. As the car began to slow down as it approached ever nearer to the blocks where the rioters made their voices heard, the sergeant related an uncomfortable piece of office gossip: several known anarchists and radicals who had been under the government's watch had all seemingly slipped off their handlers and were, at present, unable to be found."

hotautumn.78.t:0 "The Shot"
hotautumn.78.d:0 "A raging mass of rioters surged once more against the line of police that, while determined and substantially armed and armored, was growing more outnumbered by the hour. Most of those facing off against these enforcers of order were laborers native to industrial Bicocca who had finally broken under the backwards labor policies still common in factories across the nation. Some were young, well educated students, believers in the theories of Marx and Engels, idealistic rebels against the system they had grown up into, the system they were certain was a broken mess. A few key figures, dispersed throughout the sea of discontent, stood out starkly from the older men in working clothes and the students in the fashions of the day. These gentlemen were grim, grey faced and dark-eyed; some bore distinct scars and all wore outfits as badly worn as the most overworked of the factory men. The police, blind as they were to the happenings within the riot's territory, had no idea that it was these determined and militant pugilists who were at present building up the rioters' fury and passions with their denouncements of the rich and powerful. \n\nDespite the tough talk from the hardliners within the crowd, the general mood of the assembled discontented citizens seemed to be cooling as the sun progressed in its upward journey. At least, so it seemed to Mario Calabrò as he watched one cluster of students trickle out from their peers and surrender to the waiting police. He could hardly fault them, they were hardly more than children after all, and even his deep commitment to the protest he had willingly joined couldn't stop him from worrying for the safety of his young comrades who were not much older than his eldest son. Still, it seemed as if not everyone felt the same way, and his heart sank at seeing how this small defeat had engaged the greater mass once again into anger and action, only this time it was not righteous fury directed against the capitalist and fascists bastardi but towards some youths who had made what was likely a sensible choice for their own safety. Men like Calabró had nothing much left to live for, but those students still had a future if they were smart enough not to waste it. One of the apparent ringleaders of the rioters hurled particularly vicious insults at the departing deffectors, and before he was given a chance to remunerate the scoundrel, the agitator drew a pistol and fired a single shot."

hotautumn.79.d:0 "Inspector Constantini felt a splatter of something liquid slap his face with enough force to make his eyes shut involuntarily. When he reopened them, the riot officer he had been conversing with mere seconds ago was on the ground and bleeding uncontrollably from a wound in his shoulder. The mass of police and rioters turned slowly, almost apprehensively, as the inspector's urgent calls for medical attention began to sound through the packed street as everything seemed to grow ominously silent. As the inspector waited tensley for any sight of responding medical personnel, something caught his attention from his peripheral vision. A group of rioters who had up until that point been almost up against the protective shields of the police were now backing away, slowly and without any fanfare, but they were backing away. Perhaps the rioters were coming to their senses, and maybe, just maybe one incident of tragic violence would prove to be a blessing in disguise. The Inspector was considering this as one of the officers across from the falling-back rioters took a slow, deliberate step forward. \n\nHe could see exactly what was about to happen, see it as if it had already happened and there was nothing he could do to prevent it. He could prevent it though, if he could only get there in time. The only problem was the man bleeding out in front of him. Leaving him unattended to cost the officer his life, and it would be Constantini's fault. The choice was painfully clear, and the answer, unfortunately, was equally so. \n\nHe was running as fast as his legs would carry him to the advancing officer, waving his arms, calling for him to stay put, but in the end he was too late. A brutal shove from the officer's riot control shield sent one of the rioters sprawling on the ground, blood pooling from the back of their head where it had cracked against the street. Another long moment of silence followed, and then with cries of mingled rage, resentment, and even fear, the line of police disintegrated into a counter-mob hell-bent of punishing the riot with any means necessary to avenge their fallen brother. Adriano Constantini could only look on in horror at the unfurling violence."

hotautumn.80.d:0 "Inspector Constantini never imagined he would hear such sounds outside of the Final Judgement, although at that precise moment, he was half convinced that that was what he was witnessing. Any semblance of order was rapidly dissolving as the riot police charged with the reckless abandon of rage and fear. They were met with an ever-increasing amount of gunfire from previously concealed firearms. If the rioters had not premeditated such violence, it was clear to the inspector that they had been prepared. The shots, however, were not all coming from the side of the rioters. Constantini looked to the rooftops of the surrounding buildings and spied at least half a dozen police sharpshooters, all of them either firing or picking targets. \n\nConstantini turned in the direction of the mobile headquarters, preparing to sprint the few blocks separating him from a chance to find someone able to restore order. The sound of an explosion and second later a chorus of cries to rival the damned stopped the veteran officer where he stood. Pale, he turned slowly around to face the source, and was met by flames rising from a score of buildings, creating a corridor of fire surrounding protests and police alike. Of course, the inspector realized, the protestors had been armed from the beginning, and guns were not the only weapon a rioter would come prepared with. He caught the glint of light as another molotov cocktail sailed in an arc that seemed almost lazy, like it was no more a tool of chaos and death than a football. It flew into a storefront window and the facade was alight almost instantly. The gunfire had slowed for a fleeting moment after the first few buildings went up, but it was now starting up once more in earnest. The pops of small pistols from the rioters and the cracks from police rifles created a terrible harmony of destruction and violence. If anyone had the power to stop this, the window to do so was closing quickly. Trying not to think about the pain and death he was essentially fleeing from like a coward, Constantini took off for the headquarters unit. Maybe they would have an answer he told himself; maybe they would have a contingency already prepared; maybe; maybe; maybe. The word rattled around in his mind as he pushed his legs to move faster."

hotautumn.81.d:0 "At first, Mario had not believed that the police would allow the block to burn. Surely, he reasoned, they would call off the mob, and the police really had descended into a mob by this point, and allowed the protestors to disperse without further violence to allow fire teams to save what they could from the conflagration. He soon realized how naive he truly was. The police were by this point in no more control of their emotions than the rioters had just before the officer was shot. Mario Calabro was a peaceful man, a family man, but in his deepest heart he had to admit to himself that if he had the chance to get ahold of the scoundrel who fired that deadly shot, he would not be responsible for his next actions. Despite the not insignificant desire to exact justice upon the guilty man, all Mario was really focusing on was finding a way to escape the chaos and return to his family. \n\nThe police seemed hellbent on making that as difficult as possible however. He could faintly see through the smoke and to the tops of several of the non-burning buildings farther back. There were at least half a dozen sharpshooters perched atop them like gargoyles, and every few minutes one would fire a shot in the direction of the riot. Most of the time the shot cracked pavement or road. Most times. The way he had come into the street was in hostile hands as it were, and so Mario scanned in the opposite direction. While free of snipers, that way was no less anarchic with the masses of fleeing protestors who were attempting to make a desperate stand against the better armed police away from the fires. Dangerous as it was, Mario had little choice, and he began moving as quickly as he could without inviting unwanted attention onto himself. \n\n Down at this end of the street there was no fire or smoke, but that only meant that those with firearms had clearer sights to kill with. Bodies already littered the ground and wounded men and women roiled in agony on sidewalks or slunk into alleys only to collapse alone. Mario saw just this happen to a boy no older than sixteen, and his fatherly instinct compelled him to step in. He had made it within a few meters of the alleyway entrance when the screams began to intensify. Shots and canisters of gas whizzed by Mario's head and his resolve faltered, a nearby building's open door seemed to invite him in to weather this storm, but that would mean abandoning the injured young man."

For a moment, or perhaps several for Mario could no longer sense the passage of time, there was an all encompassing blackness. Muffled shouts, muted crashes, and even the sound of gunshots from what felt like blocks away assailed the ears of the ill-fated laborer. From a foggy corner of his mind, Calabro wondered if it was due to the almost guaranteed concussion or if the violence had actually moved, and he began to wonder which option concerned him more, but the complex thought proved impossible to keep and it dissolved. \n\nHe opened his eyes when he felt the warm metal touch his cheek, and with his first sight since falling to the ground, Mario Calabro witnessed a vision of hell. He was not the only one lying on the ground, there were at least a dozen others. Some were groaning and attempting to crawl away or squirming meekly like birds with broken wings. Several, however, lay still and showed no signs of consciousness or even life. With an effort, he cast his eyes around his immediate surroundings. He saw several spent bullet casings strewn around the area, and realized it had been one of them that had hit his face. An empty gas canister lay near his feet, a blood-splattered dent clearly visible. \n\nHe thought about his wife, who would have to somehow navigate life without a husband. He thought about his children, who would have to grow up without their father. What had he or his family done to deserve such punishment? He wondered if he would receive any answers in the end, or if all would be consigned to oblivion. His hand felt heavy and numb, but he managed to place it into his pants pocket, and trembling, withdrew a worn photograph.

By the time the youth fell, already beyond saving, to the ground, the crowd had discerned the location where the shot's effect had landed. However, as far as Mario could tell, none besides himself had actually seen the shooter from his obscured position. It occured to the unlucky worker that without a clear idea of the real culprit, the already agitated mass of protestors would naturally rally against... He spun, and began to wave wildly around in an attempt to alert the others as to what he had just witnessed but things were already moving out of anyone one person's control. \n\nThe frustration and anger that had already been pent up inside the people from not just this protest but countless others and behind that, the economic uncertainty forever looming in the dark like some boogeyman, finally seemed to be spilling out. Clusters of the riot control officers were being faced down by dozens of approaching workers and students armed with sticks and pipes. Rocks began to pelt the protective shields which were the only thing protecting the officers from the enraged crowd. Things were going to get ugly, and get ugly very soon. \n\nSome of the police seemed ready to hold their ground to the bitter end, insane as the idea seemed to Mario, while others were already buckling under the pressure and giving ground quickly. He watched from the entrance to an alleyway, unwilling to directly participate but equally unwilling to leave before seeing the conclusion of such dramatic events. It was clear enough to him that the police were taken completely off-guard by the shooting and were in total confusion as to how to respond. He prayed silently that they would just retreat before any more blood was spilled."

The protest was quickly devolving into a riot with the death of that young man and there was a real possibility that major violence could erupt at any minute. The police had to pull back, Constantini was convinced, if there was to be any hope of a cool-off happening. That was why he ran down the blocks to the temporary headquarters with an intensity he hadn't displayed since the academy all those years ago. He had handled situations of life and death before, it was true, but he had never been so sure that the fate of hundreds of lives were hanging in the balance as he did now. There was no time to spare. \n\nThe mobile headquarters unit had changed in the relatively short time he had been away at the front lines of the protest. Several portable barriers had been erected blocking easy access to the tents and armored command vehicle that had been borrowed from the army. Around the perimeter, armed officers stood at the ready with rifles and at each tent entrance there were two sentries posted with machine guns. Apparently the brass was getting mighty paranoid, but given the situation Constantini had just left, he could hardly blame them. The tent farthest back was likely where the police chief and his aides were coordinating the response. The inspector jogged up to the tent's guards and flashed his identification before disappearing inside without waiting for their response. \n\nThe chief looked pale and exhausted, and for Constantini, seeing the normally resolute and unflappable man reduced to this state frightened him more than any mob ever could. When he had entered, the head of Milan's police was in rapid fire conversation with one of his subordinates, but the Inspector's sudden appearance in the tent halted that conversation as all eyes turned toward this newcomer. Not wanting to waste any of the precious time he had, Constantini took advantage of this and began to address the chief directly. He had one shot to convince the man that pulling out would prevent further escalation, and he would need to speak quickly."

hotautumn.85.d:0 "Constantini watched from a distance as the line of officers, once more adhering to their discipline and bolstered by the men on either side, reformed the tight shield wall that they had begun this fiasco in. He silently thanked God for giving his tongue the power to persuade the chief that this was the right course of action. He had been met with initial resistance of course, none of the brass had been happy at the thought of appearing to retreat in the face of a riot. He had, luckily, been able to persuade them that keeping the police where they were would only allow the mob to encircle and destroy the riot officers and that would look even worse for the city. \n\nFor a group that had just been surrounded by scared, angry rioters eager to exact vengeance, Constantini thought the men were doing a damn good job of keeping it together. Most of the protestors, for their part, were letting the police pull put unmolested. Most of the mass had been young students and workers with families to feed, not exactly the picture of zealous fanatics willing to risk life and limb for an already finished battle. Still, there were some shady characters peeking out from the front of the crowd. They looked like they could be trouble if left unwatched, so Constantini motioned a nearby lieutenant to make sure that didn't happen. He paused long enough to make sure the instructions were relayed properly down the line -- he didn't want a trigger happy sniper getting the wrong idea and ruining everything -- and then he began to walk briskly but calmly back to the site of the mobile headquarters. \n\nThey had packed away the tents when he arrived and were beginning to load the last of the equipment into the armored vehicle. The car he had rode from the station was nowhere in sight, so the Inspector pulled himself into what seemed to him to be one of the most uncomfortable seats ever devised by man. It reminded him, he realized, of the days he had ridden in another machine quite like this one, back during the war. He was a young man himself then, no older than most of those students. He wondered, idly, if those kids would one day reflect on this protest as merely a half forgotten piece of some long, grueling war."

Except, the offices were not quite empty, not yet anyways. Inspector Adriano Constantini took another sip from a cup of black coffee as he attempted to fight off the oncoming fatigue. Only a little bit longer, he thought to himself as he pulled another piece of paper from the pile sitting atop his desk like some ancient Roman temple. Only a little more and then that will be it for tonight. Having been heavily involved in the incident the papers were now almost exclusively referring to as the "Bicocca Fire", it was to be expected that the Inspector would have a good deal of paperwork to work through. Expected, and annoying as hell. \n\nStill, the mountianload of reports he was being forced to fill out were probably going to be helpful in the very near future. As officials all over the country from Sicily to Venice were discovering, stamping out one flame would not be enough. Given that tensions in the country were running so high they could be cut with a knife, perhaps they should not have been surprised when similar demonstrations began to pop up in most major cities with industrial centers. Even when those were put down, some more peaceful than others, things did not improve. In fact, the riots and protests were merely the beginning.
