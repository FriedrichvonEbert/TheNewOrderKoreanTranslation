 GER_Bormann_category_desc:0 "The Third Reich's politics are a labyrinthine mess - the legacy of Hitler's constant playing off of various factions and individuals against one another. Anyone with even a modicum of power is convinced that they, and they alone, know what is best for Germany. As a result, the various demographics and interest groups within the Reich can never be relied upon to support each other, only the Führer. In order to bind the fractured Reich back together, he will have to court or coerce each and every one of these dissident factions, bringing them back into line under the Führerprinzip. Should he fail, the Reich is sure to enter a state of stagnation, decline and ultimately collapse. Only a will of iron, ruthless intrigue and the velvet glove can save National Socialism."

 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_0_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nThe §YParty Bureaucracy§! is the layer of pencil-pushers, office drones, and career politicians dedicated to maintaining the byzantine system of the Reich just to keep it all running. Composed of the chief decision-making organs of Germany, the §YBureaucracy§! has historically been under the influence of former Chief of the NSDAP Chancellery and now Führer Martin Bormann and his §LConservative§! allies. However, that grip has increasingly been chipped away at over time being particularly damaged with the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg and the later efforts at reintegration in hopes of stability. Increasingly troublesome, the §LConservatives§! must act swiftly to secure their control over the Bureaucratic Atlas of the Reich."

 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_1:0 "The People"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_1_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nNumbering over a hundred million, the Reich's citizens have been in a state of division and unrest for upwards of a decade. Once, the glory of conquest instilled them with tremendous patriotism, while the flow of loot, imports and raw materials from occupied territories allowed them to enjoy some of the highest living standards in the world. Now, the vast din of humanity cries out to their Führer; some for bread, some for lead; some for peace, some for war; some for life, some for death. It was the people who made the triumph of National Socialism possible, and they can bring it down just as easily."
 
 ##SIG #2:INTELLIGENTSIA
 BOR_SIGName_2:0 "Intelligentsia"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_2:0 "Intelligentsia"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_2_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nOften shunned for being a hive of liberalism, Marxism and Jewish sympathies, the intelligentsia of the Reich have existed mostly in the background for three decades now. The brain-drain following the rise of the NSDAP was never quite compensated for, but enough remained in their schools and universities to keep the German intellectual tradition alive. Publicly, they remain something of a wildcard, but the connection between Speerism, the student movement and the intellectuals is plainly obvious. In the grand scheme of things they are mostly irrelevant to the Party, but their influence over young, impressionable minds should not be underestimated."
 
 ##SIG #3:CHURCH
 BOR_SIGName_3:0 "Church"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_3:0 "The Church"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_3_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nLong the subject of suppression (violent or otherwise), Germany's religious institutions are an eternal thorn in the Führer's side. Often serving as useful idiots during Hitler's rise to power, they were quickly restrained and stripped of their influence following his assumption of absolute rule over Germany. Theoretically, the Vatican Concordat saw reconciliation between the Catholic Church and the NSDAP, but in practice they continued to oppose National Socialist racial policies and antisemitism, even sheltering Jews and political dissidents. As a result, they faced a vicious crackdown from the SS under Heydrich. They are rarely involved in politics anymore, but are still able to compete with the NSDAP for the hearts and minds of the German people - a grave threat for National Socialism's future prospects, should their bonds be broken."
 
 ##SIG #4:HEER
 BOR_SIGName_4:0 "Heer"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_4:0 "The Heer"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_4_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nThe strong right arm of the Führer, it was the Heer that broke the backs of our foes and brought final victory to the Third Reich. It still contains many hardened veterans of the long and bloody Second World War, capable soldiers no matter how grayed their hair or scarred their flesh. Though politically dominated by Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's clique of hardline militarists, the Heer's leanings as a whole are not uniform. Many chose to soldier for Speer, Speidel or Bormann during the Bürgerkrieg. Though their ideals are varied, the various factions within the Heer invariably agree on one thing: their sacrifices made Germany what it is today, and they must be respected accordingly. Failing to honour one of the world's largest armies could have dire consequences."
 
 ##SIG #5:KRIEGSMARINE
 BOR_SIGName_5:0 "Kriegsmarine"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_5:0 "Kriegsmarine"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_5_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nOft-forgotten by Germany at large, only the Führers and their party have ever truly appreciated the Reich's navy. Without the tireless work of its u-boat wolfpacks and the mighty guns of its cruisers and battleships, the invasion of Britain would never have been viable. Today, the Kriegsmarine is the means by which the Reich projects its power throughout the Atlantic, providing vital security for its western holdings and the Afrikan Reichskommissariats. Many an American scouting flotilla has been turned away from German waters by the presence of a Kriegsmarine strike force appearing on the horizon. Without them, the Reich cannot hope to retain its place as one of the world's great powers."

 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_6_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nThe Ordnungspolizei - more commonly known as the Orpo - is Germany's civilian police force, the means by which the NSDAP maintains order in the streets and keeps unruly citizens in line. Far from an ordinary police force, the Orpo is completely politicized, using violence and brutality at every turn to maintain the Führer's rule. Orpo recruits are chosen for their strength and loyalty, not policing skills or temperament. Though traditionally obedient to the letter, the Orpo has been severely shaken by the Bürgerkrieg and by the years of unrest leading up to it. Their numbers plummeted with the outbreak of war due to desertion, conscription, enlistment and infighting, and the organisation is not the beast it used to be. Still, they must be rebuilt - and, if necessary, broken and forced to serve once more."
 
 ##SIG #7:MITTELDEUTSCHE INDUSTRY

 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_7_tt:0 "§YReichswerke§!\n§g--------------------§!\nDominated mostly by Reichswerke (formerly known as Reichswerke Hermann Göring), a major steel and arms conglomerate, the industry of §YCentral Germany§! is the closest to Germania and therefore both easy to influence and an influencer itself. Much of the economy in §YCentral Germany§! relies on these corporations; in an ideal world they would provide hundreds of thousands of jobs for the massive populace of Germania. However, Germania is largely an economic drain, as much of the jobs that would have gone to the populace have instead become subject to the system of slave contracting, whereby corporations contract the labor of groups of slaves owned by some holder. The executives of these corporations have little incentive to change the situation, as the Bürgerkrieg's massive civilian casualties have made the use of cheap slave renting even more attractive as an option to rebuild their shattered holdings."
 
 ##SIG #8:RHINE INDUSTRY
 BOR_SIGName_8:0 "IG Farben"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_8:0 "IG Farben"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_8_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nThe largest players in the Rhineland's industry are IG Farben, one of the world's largest chemical companies, and a great innovator in the field of synthetic oil; and Krupp, a centuries-old titan of steel and guns responsible for a sizeable chunk of German heavy industry in both World Wars. There are, of course, dozens of industrial corporations in the Rhineland, but the dominance of these two is near-absolute when it comes to politics. Overwhelmingly favoured by Hitler during his reign, the sheer amount of industrial output produced by these juggernauts is truly staggering - or it was, before the Bürgerkrieg saw the Rhineland become a battlefield. As the coal-fields of the Ruhr valley become active again and the wheels of industry begin to turn once more, the Führer must tread carefully around the giants of Rhenish industry and their countless slaves, for another upset could see the German economy collapse completely for a second time."
 
 ##SIG #9:SÜDDEUTSCHE INDUSTRY
 BOR_SIGName_9:0 "Siemens"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_9:0 "Siemens"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_9_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nLess directly tied to the war industry than its northern and western counterparts, the corporations of the south are no less vital to the economy. Requiring more skilled laborers, corporations like Siemens (innovators in computing and electronic machines) and Daimler-Benz (producers of both military and civilian vehicles) have little use for slaves, though small workforces of them are still maintained for drudge work. This leaves them in something of a precarious position; there are not enough skilled workers in Germany to allow them to grow, but purchasing and training slaves to build delicate electronics, engines and whitegoods is out of the question. The United States and Japan are quickly outpacing German innovation in these areas, and resentment has been stewing against the NSDAP's obsession with heavy industry for decades now. The Führer must put them to use, or put them down."
 
 ##SIG #10:SLAVE PLANTATIONS

 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_10:0 "Slave Plantations"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_10_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nIn the verdant fields of Prussia toil several million slaves, working endlessly for the function of the great §YSlave Plantations§! and the various industries which support their mass production of food goods and textiles for the Reich. Founded on the back of the conquests of the 2nd World War, the §YSlave Plantations§! play a special role in the lives of Veterans of the wars, often being owned in part or in whole by these veterans and employing them in no small numbers to help with the maintenance of the §YPlantations§!. It is no question, then, that the §YSlave Plantations§! are strongly aligned with the interests of those now privileged Veterans of the War. Defined in no small part by the extreme pro-slave and pro-expansionist politics, the §YSlave Plantations§! are a stronghold of §RMilitarist§! support."
 
 ##SIG #11:BANKS
 BOR_SIGName_11:0 "Banks"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_11:0 "The Banks"
 BOR_SIGName_Formatted_11_tt:0 "§Y[BOR_SIG_GetName_Formatted_New]§!\n§g--------------------§!\nA favorite target of the Nazis from the earliest days, banks are eternally unpopular but necessary for the survival of the Third Reich. Though 'Jewish' and 'plutocratic' influences were purged long ago, the same complains endure: the banks are greedy, deprive the common man of his earnings and are responsible for every single economic hardship endured by Germany. Ironically, the banks have always held close ties to the NSDAP, handling the financial wizardry that enabled Hitler's 'economic miracle' of the early 1930s. The banks also managed the massive influx of loot from occupied nations, turning it into liquid assets to fuel the engine of the German war machine and keep the citizenry fed and clothed. Though theoretically at the Führer's beck and call, the banks control far too much of the Reich's economy for his liking; crossing them could prove particularly disastrous, no matter how many guns he can point in their direction."
