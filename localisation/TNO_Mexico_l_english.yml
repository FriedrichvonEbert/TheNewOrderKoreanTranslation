 POLITICS_ADOLFO_LOPEZ_MATEOS_DESC:0 "While the world journeys onwards with the cracking bells of revolution and the marching boots of invasion, some men must find themselves able to write themselves out of the hell of ignorance and resistance. Adolfo López Mateos stands as one of these men, dedicating himself as a man for his country in his work as a simple secretary before his rise to electoral success in the Mexican Senate, a place as equally fiery and changing as the Revolution that instituted it in the first place. Smiles, shaking hands, and attending parties would dominate his next few years, as through the hands of smiling friends in the Senate came the birth of his new title, as Secretary of Labor in the wake of the position's immense growth. \n\nAs the Nazi raged across Europe and the Japanese blitzed across the Pacific, Mexico stood shakily by, with Mateos swearing by the Estrada Doctrine as his gospel of neutrality in hopes of preserving a safe and secure Mexican nation. And through this neutrality came pesos for the Mexican, as Mateos continued to drive forth ideals of neutrality backed by Mexiacan nationalism, seeking to bring the Mexican working class together and managed to win the Presidency after his nomination by the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1958. Through his Presidency, Mateos has worked diligently to ensure that the Mexican state maintains unity and independence past the grabbing hands of powers throughout the world. \n\nHowever, President Adolfo López Mateos's fight for Mexico's individuality continues to entrench itself across the country. Throughout the Mexican government, Senators, Deputies, and Mateos's own cabinet officials find themselves wooed by the ever growing influence of the Americans and the Japanese, where some have argued the path for Mexico's future, and the path to economic boom, lie. With discussions of trade and the end of Mateos's Presidency on the horizon, the questions of Mexico's future lie on everyone's mind, as the PRI's one party domination means a choice for Mateo to choose an heir to his Presidential throne, one who may throw the country to American or Japanese winds..."

MEX_Economic_Battlefield:0 "An Economic Battlefield"
MEX_Economic_Battlefield_desc:0 "In the revolution's aftermath, our nation almost became an economic pariah for ending the foreign control of our economy through nationalizations and protectionism. Used to the largesses afforded to them during the Porfiriato, moneyed interests in America and beyond lobbied hard against the winners of the Revolution, determined to regain their ascendency over Mexico. The second world war ended these attempts in a dramatic fashion; dependant on Mexican oil to fuel their desperate war, the Americans gave up on their dreams of economic subjugation.\n\nSince then, Mexico has done very well for itself through neutrality, selling goods and oil to the entire world. Yet this economic miracle has proven itself a double edged sword. Their appetites wetted by the current prosperity, many among the elite dream of using a bidding war between the OFN and the Sphere to increase both their profits and Mexico's international prestige. Already, American business conglomerates and Japanese zaibatsus clash over hegemony in Mexican affairs. Despite the common people's warriness at moving away from the ideals of the Revolution, it seems some of our politicians scheme of the end of Mexican neutrality."
MEX_Fraying_Ideals:0 "Fraying Ideals"
MEX_Fraying_Ideals_desc:0 "The long and bloody upheavals of the Mexican Revolution had not yet ended when the fight over the Revolution's true meaning begun. Had it been a struggle to free Mexican democracy from Porfirio Diaz and his corrupt cientifico clique, or an uprising by the people to end foreign dominance of the economy? There were as many reasons for the revolutions as there were factions within the maelstrom of violence. Eventually, the victors established what would become the PRI, the "Partido Revolucionaro Institucional" or "Institutional Revolutionary Party". These victors proceeded to determine what it all had been about, uniting the divided nation.\n\nNow the PRI has ironically evolved into a creature uncomfortably reminiscent of the old Porfirian oligarchy. As Mexico's one dominant party, the PRI has become a target of foreign schemes to undermine our hard-won economic independence, which has begun to fracture the large coalition of unions, technocrats, and politicians that hold up the party. Many now find themselves embroiled in ideological conflicts, with none more vicous then those that have broken out in the cabinet of Adolfo Mateos. Although no side has the upper hand, one thing is certain: whichever faction wins will determine the Party's, and therefore Mexico's, future. "
