Their advantage lies in knowing the terrain of the country, having overwhelming amounts of control in their region of the country, and an internal division that allows its component organizations to function independently.\n\nThe solution to these problems is the application of decisive, overwhelming firepower. Bombs and artillery shells do not make exception for even the most well-entrenched positions, individual villages and bases of operations can be destroyed quite easily and thoroughly when pinpointed, and every group within the insurgency we eliminate will diminish the will of the insurgents to fight on. With this plan in mind, coordination between our forces on this strike is critical.

Part of the reason our offensives have been so lackluster to this point is the need to conserve our limited manpower. The drawdown of troops has severely affected our capabilities to operate in Africa, and when we needed more soldiers we found ourselves with less.\n\nIt will certainly ruffle some feathers in Congress, but we need every man we can get.

For centuries, Africa had been exploited for resources by its colonial overlords - and the continent had been left underdeveloped as a result.\n\n"We're going to be drawing the borders in Africa specifically to ensure economic interdependence among the new countries," Peers said, before his shoulders slumped. "I have nothing to say to that, since I've been pushing for more local participation from the get-go."\n\n"That's the point," Westmoreland said. "Mutual dependence forces compromise, and if compromise is the essence of democracy, then this will fit our objectives perfectly."\n\nAbrams folded his arms. "Can we convince Washington? Shouldn't we have gone for fewer territories - less regulatory burden for our companies?"\n\n"It'd be a non-starter with the Africans," Westmoreland grimaced. "But Africa's so lacking in capital that we'll probably get a foothold regardless."\n\nThe room fell silent. Like so much about the CAR, the proposal had boundless potential, hobbled by necessary compromises in pursuit of optimistic objectives. Peers got the last word in."

He'd heard that on his last mission, checking out yet another radio signal in the wilderness - they didn't trust the local units to not desert. He'd been lucky so far, but if something went wrong now, they'd be walking back to Leopoldville - if the German remnant, the guerillas, or crocodiles didn't kill them first.\n\nThe helicopter touched down gently on the verdant bank of the Congo Lake, and Martinez's unit fanned out to scout the campsite. It was abandoned - only a few tins of canned food and several German rifles remained. Tracks of dirt stretched out from the extinguished campfire, as if somebody had dragged a sack along the ground into the surrounding treeline.\n\nIt told a familiar story: a German remnant unit, operating on the fringes of the American-controlled zones in the CAR (which was everywhere, if Martinez was honest), had radioed for backup, giving away their position.

Our wounds, suffered at the hands of imperialists, slice deep into the innocent's soul."\n\nLifting himself up into the still air of the night, the firebrand expanded his message.

They'll make one a leader, make an administration out of the rest, give them firearms and explosives and American educations. At least the Germans would tell us they hated us, and now here we have Americans claiming to have "freed" us, all while killing our children and robbing us of our wealth, and doing what the Germans would have done only worse and more destructive."\n\n"But there is still hope.

In an effort to bring together resistance and political leaders from across Africa for the talks, the African delegation included Robert Mugabe, Idi Amin, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, Jonas Savimbi, Nelson Mandela and Patrice Lumumba.\n\nYet our efforts have ended in disaster. Almost immediately anger erupted from the African delegation with General Westmoreland accidentally welcoming them to Salisbury, the former colonial name of the city. It got a little better as talks began, with many African delegates demanding to know why they were not already free with the supposed liberation of the continent. The intended month long conference finally collapsed during lunch when an apparent miscommunication caused MPs to refuse General Amin entry to a bathroom on the grounds it was for whites only.

Such a result, achieved simply through talking and compromise! Perhaps not everything had gone as Westmoreland had wished, but, he decided, a peaceful transition to free democracy was more than many had expected. If nothing else, achieving that was something to be proud of.\n\nIt was now time to prepare to leave, and while Westmoreland couldn't say he would miss all the struggles that came with it, his time spent here in Africa would always hold a special, irreplaceable place in his heart. As he packed his bags, he began to realize that for all his time spent as a soldier, meant to fight wars and shed blood, his greatest accomplishment would always be the restoration of peace and prosperity on the African continent, even if nobody else in the United States ever recognized it for what it was. It was important to Africa, and that was good enough for him."

 OFN_CAR.110.desc:0 "General Westmoreland had read several books on Africa written by the old colonial powers. Short of necromancy, it was the best way to solicit advice from those who had successfully kept some semblance of order on the continent in the past. Those old books gave accounts of small ethnic groups, with relatively unorganized politics. If those accounts were true in the 1860's, a hundred years has certainly not borne them out! Indeed, the diplomatic teams Peers sent out had found a very defined structure, with deep and far-reaching local politics. The Pan-Africanist movement, the most influential native political movement, was based in Cameroon but had reach from Dakar to Pretoria. The more moderate African Socialist movement had two main branches, one led by Kaunda in Zambia and the other led by Nyererere in Tanganyika. In addition, there were the numerous warlords and democratic movements to consider.\n\nWestmoreland called up Peers. By sheer statistical probability, there had to be at least a few groups in Africa willing to make a deal with OFN."

The unrest in Central Africa had become worse than anyone could have predicted. The area was underdeveloped to say the least, and roving bands of rebels could trek through the forest without being picked up, only to strike at whatever helpless patrol came next.\n\nThe captain on the other end could be heard faintly over the screams of artillery fire, though the message would be the same as the other two dozen. Local forces defecting or vanishing, growing protests outside military stations, outright ambushes by unrestrained partisans.\n\nWere things to continue at this rate, the Central African Republic would shatter into countless anti-American partisans, and the region would be no better off than it was a century ago. He gave a blunt response to hold on and fall back if needed, then slammed the phone back down. This position was going to give him nothing but scorn from the brass in Washington, and he knew it. The only out, it seemed, would to gather an outright war council, Cyrus Vance be damned. That snotty representative didn't see anything outside the filing cabinets and trips to Washington.

 OFN_CAR.201.desc:0 "One of the most critical parts of fighting any war are the communication lines. The very veins of an army, it is through communication that soldiers not only receive their initial orders, but also request supplies, reinforcements, and instructions in uncertain situations. There is a critical issue with communications in a land as full of chaos and strife as Africa, however. Rebels, bandits, and pirates could all intercept communications for their own purposes should the lines number too many and become easily overlooked. At the same time, if communication is restricted to the radio, it won't be able to be safely received inland, making it more difficult to ready our forces there for fighting. This dilemma plagues the leadership of the OFN forces, just as it did the Germans before them. In the end, one of two choices must be made by Westmoreland himself: increase the number of communication lines and thereby risk further interception of messages, or limit communications and impair progress away from the coast."

And when they did, they offered little options for him. Central Africa's own troops would have been more useful if they became sandbags, and so a plan was discussed to focus on organizing and consolidating OFN units together to intimidate would-be protestors and guerillas. The other Chief of Staff butted in, suggesting a more internal approach. Following and tracking rebel groups would ensure areas at low risk of attack could divert troops to more likely targets. Thanking the men, Westmoreland told the two, frankly, that he really only had the capability for one of the two strategies, and asked for the preferential option.\n\n"Your choice, general.

Abrams simply shook his head, while Vance simply sat back and let the top brass argue.\n\n"You can't tell me to my face this is under control, Peers. Do you know how many times I have to wake up to another blocked column, or the natives ending up 50 miles from where the last report was!? This jungle's already hell on Earth. Might as well make sure we don't leave a single village ignored." he snapped back, gesturing to a cluster of stars in a valley.\n\n"I've got both Joint Chiefs of Staff ordering me to call in reinforcements, and I'm inclined to agree with them. Abrams?"\n\n"Like Westmoreland said, doesn't matter if we restore every regiment if the enemy they're told to fight comes up from behind."\n\nAgain and again the generals made the same points, and eventually Cyrus Vance went with Peers, disapproving of bringing evermore American soldiers when Westmoreland's goal was to calm down the situation.

Clear bombing sites, coordinated advances. There would be no excuse for his officers to fail now, and the hesitant complaints from Vance and the Washington suits had no sway in the campaign.\n\nAll that remained was a suggestion from General Abrams on the inclusion of local troops alongside the American offensive. Such weak-willed men were the reason that the first campaign had failed, but some basic training by our reserves might make them better than nothing.

On the ground, the illusion faded almost instantly. Like ticks, the native militias would dig deep in the villages and jungles, sucking away American money, American morale, and American lives. The "good African" was hard to pick out even among the most friendly organizations, and the bad ones seemed to hide along every inch of the road.\n\nWestmoreland knew this better than most of his equals stationed in the mandates, and could only sigh to himself as they reported betrayals by seemingly trustworthy locals. William's categorizations were much stricter, and he prided himself that those Africans to serve alongside his own troops could be considered as loyal as his own bodyguard. Such high standards, however, meant that there were few who could reach them.\n\nThe problem became much more present after the discovery of a friendly partisan group, if any could be called such. Their leader, according to the call back to his office, had simply gathered whatever men "fell short" of being Good Africans, and put them to use. William admired the man's tact, and had invited him to further talks.\n\nLike he said before, the confusing and often irregular standards of goodness left hundreds of able-bodied and amiable Africans without command. And that, he concluded to the general, would make in fact make them perfect targets for enemy recruiters. The system would have to change, the African warned, unless a "mostly good" man could only find work with the bad apples."

So blind was their hatred that the mines and camps sending valuable resources to the ports would be torched as "monuments to the collaborators". General Abrams had joked to Westmoreland one day, "The Japs would show more humanity to one of their traitors than those folks in the jungle."\n\nSuch a simple mindset was expected, but it would be the seed of an idea. Were the rebels so eager to hunt down the American-friendly Africans, why not let them give chase? African formations could help draw out the enemy, and if spread thin enough, force them to follow suit. Keep those asses running further away from their bases, and they'd end up cut off and alone. Best of all, those damned fools would fall for it every time. He smiled at the thought of the suits in Arlington blustering over the phones over such uncouth and dangerous behavior, but it didn't matter. He'd throw a dozen locals into the open if it could draw out the rebels, perhaps even two dozen. The zealous rebels might get their vengeance, but it would be their last victory before they found themselves surrounded.\n\nAnd so Westmoreland began formulating the order to send out to all field commanders. Were they to keep to it, far fewer Americans might end up returning home in a casket. And wasn't that reason enough to sacrifice some disease-ridden local with an American rifle to keep a real soldier from being kept out of action?"

The man kept insisting the new American troops were inadequately trained, Washington said he set ridiculous goals, and the two would bite each other's ass until the end of time.\n\nThe engineers fanned out to plan out some possible building locations, where the roads would go, and all the logistics Ray couldn't be bothered to understand. There was a method to their investigations, and it was not his place to question it. He was just here as security. The heat wasn't too bad, not much different than a summer day in New Mexico.\n\nThe few towns that were close by didn't offer much connection to the outside world, save a German airstrip that looked to be half-done. The locals said the Reichskommissar had sent some construction crews, but the war came only a few days later and they never returned.

Besides ruining any advantage of surprise they might have, delaying action would allow rebel forces to prepare as well, and it was hard to tell which side would benefit more from having more time to prepare for battle. Time was of the essence, though, and so the sooner a decision was made, the better the chances of success were.\n\nAt last deciding on the best course of action, Westmoreland called in his aide, and revealed his choice."

If there was any difference between the past Reichskommisariats and the current Republic, he wanted that attitude to be it.\n\nThe forces under his command had been prepared and adapted as much as they could be for the coming battles, now they just had to fight them and, God willing, win them. If they could not, then no hope remained for this bright ember of liberty at the heart of Africa.

It turned out, people weren't exactly lining up to thank the guy who threw the tyrant off his throne only to sit his own ass down on that same throne. For months, Westmoreland and his men spent at least as much time fighting the natives as they did fighting the remaining Nazis, and even those natives who could be convinced to come to the table could never agree on a plan to govern Africa after his men were gone.Now the General and his men were on boats heading back to the States, and the natives had moved on from fighting in the conference room to fighting on the battlefield.\n\nWestmoreland turned his gaze from the shore to the boats beside him. At least the evacuation went about as well as could be hoped, chaotic, yet with minimal losses. For all the administrative hell he had been through, the General had no regrets, he and his men had fought the good fight against the Nazis and had did their level best to build a stronger Africa.\n\nGeneral Westmoreland went down to his quarters.

Ever since the mangroves had placed themselves, and ultimately intertwined themselves into the fabric of the coastline, bouncing off the shoreside had become ever so difficult. The Americans had eased his duties, the craters and dense fires caused by their incessant blasting downwards created pockets of cleared-away beach where the charred, gnarled roots of the mangroves could be seen under the clear lakewater. Jonas's fishing trawler hit up against the shallow bottom-edges of the Congo Lake, where one could spot on the brownish-green rocks habitats of newly-born life. Algae coated just about everything, yet it all still moved in beautiful, cyclonic motions as if children exploring new environments. Starfish skating along the surface of the rocks. Small crabs snipping at even smaller groups of fish, travelling by wherever cracks allowed them to. Strange biological formations, mushroom-like in their growth, clung to and breathed with the underside of the rocks. Even in this unholy, Nazi-engineered natural catastrophe, life found a way not only to survive, but to thrive.\n\nCarefully, Jonas picked up with elongated, bony and dry fingers a dusty metal pole with a sharpened end. Seeing in his sights a fat and heavy lungfish, attempting to find escape from the claustrophobic, shallow rocks, Jonas launched his pole against the waters, beating into the very hide of the Congo Lake. Pulling back, Jonas revealed the corpse of the lungfish, now attached to the end of his pole and spraying watery-blood onto his fishing trawler. Pulling out a dull and rusty releasable knife, Jonas prepared to end the short but perhaps exciting life of the lungfish who would become his family's dinner meal. However, a sight deeper down the lakeside stole his attention before Jonas could finish his duty. Glorified by the shifting water-spritz of the Congo Lake, which seemed to wrap itself around and shimmer towards an industrial-scale fishing trawler, Jonas's eyes were instantly drawn towards its glorious bounty. On its back was a magnificent net of golden string holding together a writhing mass of fish, practically bursting forth with enough sustenance to feed his and his neighboring villages for months on end. Holding up his knife next to the near-mirage of the trawler's bounty, a "little" idea popped into Jonas's mind."

Sea foam, built-up under the pressure of Jonas's fishing trawler, crashed against the bow and into the still, somewhat stoic bodies of Jonas's makeshift "crew". The crystal, shiny blue lakewater of the Congo seemed to dance, to parade and march with Jonas's triumph. Wielded in Jonas's arms was a frankly terrible, shoddily-built and (most likely) jammed rifle, a leftover from a few members of the village who had entered into the local Waffen-SS chapter. It didn't matter if it worked, though. A few days of scouting American seafaring vessels in the Congo Lake, at least those used for fishing or the like, proved how woefully unprepared they were for naval incursions. The Zentralafrikans never bothered to poke America's naval might, it seemed, and so American shipping had grown fat and lazy off of its "safety". Jonas, rubbing his water-scrubbed, unshaven chin, thought over the possibilities of what just up and taking an American boat could provide him. Months worth of fish, more riches than he had ever laid his eyes on, a lifetime of prestige and the raucous power of an industrial-scale fishing trawler. What sane fisherman wouldn't snatch that deal? Looking over to his "comrades" in arms, Jonas read their serious expressions, recalling their motives. One was an adrenaline-chaser, another was looking to provide for his sickly infant. One of them, proudly wearing a deep-red kerchief, was looking to take vengeance on those greedy American corporations, those who were raping Africa of its natural resources the instant the "liberators" had arrived.\n\nSpotting an American trawler in the hazy horizon, Jonas and his crewmates gathered together their firearms, blunt objects and make-do grappling hooks. Swaying, forwards and backwards, the Jonas crew steadied themselves as the choppy waters beat against their attempts at balance. Spray of lakewater encircled their vision, forming a murky, almost-supernatural funnel towards the great steel-beast awaiting the oncoming struggle. At last, Jonas's trawler hit up against the porpoising edge of the American vessel. The crew threw up ropes and following a surprisingly short blur of rods beating against raw flesh, and a few rogue shots of a flare gun, the Jonas crew were commanding the Americans. Soon after, the Jonas crew abandoned the site with their glorious prize, leaving only blood leaking into the briny depths below for whoever would chase them."

They're trying to reestablish minority rule here, we're here to keep the natives under control for when they execute their plot!"\n\nMichael was left panting for breath, but his ranting had produced less of a stir than he had been expecting. "And?" Manson asked.\n\n"And? What do you mean 'and'"? Michael all but shouted, "They're trying to use us to oppress the natives, to kill innocents!"\n\nManson hopped out of his bunk, patting Michael on the shoulder. "C'mon, Mike. You've been in this business long enough to know how this all works. We're mercenaries. We've done far worse than a little oppression."\n\nThe barracks chuckled at the assertion, and Michael stormed out into the warm night air. Maybe the company had done worse, but he wasn't about to."

Fed up with his fellow mercenaries, Michael had fled the small town, heading for the capital of Lusaka in a car that he had stolen from the mercenary's stores. What had surprised the young now ex-mercenary was when his two friends, Maes and Vlasanov, had decided to come with him. The two had come from backgrounds of living under oppressive minority rule: Maes was a Belgian, and Vlasanov was from Moscow. They had become mercenaries to escape from the brutality of racial oppression, and were not about to use this freedom to enforce the suffering they themselves had fled. Thus, they did not hesitate to go with Michael to the capital, where they would meet with the man targeted in the plot himself.\n\n"And why should I believe anything you have to say?" asked Kenneth Kaunda, "For all I know you could be here trying to sell me your services against an enemy that doesn't exist."\n\n"Mr. Kaunda, we're not trying to sell-" Michael pleaded, and then stopped. He took a moment to collect himself before continuing, "I understand why you might not trust us, we barely seem trustworthy. But what reason would we have to lie to you? We don't want any money for this, all that we want is to keep the conspiracy from coming to fruition."\n\nKaunda rubbed his chin, visibly mulling it over. "If nothing else, it's worth investigating," he muttered under his breath, "If you're lying, it's a simple waste of time, but if you're telling the truth..."

Kaunda had accepted Michael's offer of help, and assigned the man to search southern Zambia with a group of native Zambian militiamen for signs of the ultranationalist cell. It had been gruelling work thus far, requiring hours of staggering through brush, searching for even the faintest hints that something large had clunked their way through. It was on the fifth day of searching that they had found something.\n\n"Look, down there" one of the militiamen had said, handing Michael a pair of binoculars, "There's a camp in the clearing. I count maybe ten tents." Michael peered through the offered instrument, confirming the count. A plan was quickly drawn up, and they would attack come nightfall.\n\nThe fighting was brief. Outnumbered and taken by surprise as they were, the ultranationalists were quickly overcome by the larger force of militiamen. Although they must have realized the situation was hopeless, the ultranationalists fought to the last man, taking no quarter and offering none in turn. The grim work was accomplished by mid morning.\n\nKaunda hadn't been happy when he heard the news of the slaughter, some days later, but Michael could see a sense of relief rush through the man in the slump of his shoulders. "You've done Zambia a great service, Mr. Grigg," he said, "One that we will not be quick to forget."\n\n"All I wanted was to make things right," Michael responded, "Fix something that I broke."\n\n"Indeed," Kaunda said, a small smile settling on his face, "A noble sentiment, though one sadly rare in today's day and age, a sentiment one that I feel Zambia can use more of."\n\n"What do you mean?" asked Michael.\n\n"I mean what I said," responded Kaunda, his smile growing, "There's a place for someone who thinks like in the Zambian army.

All were filled with the same sort of vaguely patriotic nonsense calling for the removal of America from Africa and alternating between calling for an Africa ruled by the African people, and one ruled by God. The first few letters had been dismissed as nonsense created by a native who had learned to half speak English and wished to frighten naive American soldiers. A few were even convinced that the letters had to have been a prank by a bored soldier.\n\nHowever, the Freedom Military Force was no longer a laughing matter. They had begun to attack American operations with gusto, participating in bombings, shootings, and even the occasional kidnapping. Every letter that arrived heralded an attack of some sort, some move that the revolutionary group wished to claim credit for or some colonial operation they wished to denounce. The newest letter was most damning of all.\n\nWord has spread that the Freedom Military Force is planning to attack the All-African Congress, given the open disdain they seem to hold for it.

From a place of heartwarming tones, deep oranges and the yellows of nighttime gas lights, into the dark, unforgiving blues and violets of the Congo Lake's embrace. A scout, branded by OFN paint, sat cross-legged at the helm of a patrol boat, skating along the Congo Lake's near-black tides. Brass had thrown him and his fellows into the wilds in search of intel around these parts, God knows they had fuck all. Twitching for the all-encompassing cold, and for what he had come to know, this scout, just a boy they all called "Young", dragged down cigarette after cigarette in the hopes of feeling home. Freshly-painted camouflage dripped down his chin, the sound of "drip drip drip" intermingling with the spray of the Congo Lake. Thinking back to his last Christmas in Wisconsin, just a hazy memory now, Young managed to recall the fireplace, his family, the scent of not-slop and the feeling of tinsel streaming through his hands. It was just a dream now. Running a finger through his mud-caked skin, it was just leather-hide now. The stress, the punishment, there was supposed to be something human left, and yet they had even taken that away. Snapped back to the blinding darkness, by which Congolian rainforests and writhing crowds of mosquitoes occasionally broke through to be seen by the patrol boat's meandering, dim lights, Young could hear snoring.\n\nLooking to his fellows, Young attempted to recall their names, or at least what everyone called them. There was a kraut, called Lil' Hans for his infamous work with the Ostafrikans. He was the only fucker left who knew these parts, so they threw him in with the scouts. He never talked, though he was prone to under-the-breath German cusses. He preferred heroin, the classical choice. Pigs was there too. He was the one snoring. A real fat fucker, yet a useful cartographer. Also an annoying, but nevertheless handy bastard. How he stayed so... large, Young wondered. LSD was his go-to. Captain of it all was Leroy. A black man, he had volunteered for this shitshow to escape the South. He didn't take any drugs, instead he just wore a never-ending, thousand-yard stare. Though they were thrown together, each of them remained as lonely as ever.  Every man an island. Young dared not imagine what his "comrades-in-arms" had seen."

Facing Pigs, who breathed forward moist and humid gasps of air from the obese flaps he called a neck, Young laid down the card game he had been playing as Pigs popped pills. Seeing his tired, dour expression reflecting in Pigs's tinted aviators, Young stood up and looked over the green, muddy waters to the Congo Lake's famous mangroves. Noticing a strange, vine-coated and half-sunken white obtrusion from the jungles, Young shouted at Captain Leroy to dock, who too had been watching the structure eagle-eyed. Hans stood up from shaving his hairs with a Bowie knife, whispering to himself "...Hitlerstadt?"\n\nAs the boat neared the collapsed resort, Pigs yelled at Hans "What the hell is this, Kraut? I thought you knew where we were going!" In response, Hans simply looked away with a somewhat confused, somewhat ashamed expression, flush exposing itself through his tanned cheeks.\n\nJumping from the hot-metal patrol boat to the flooded-over docks of Hitlerstadt, Young felt his balance porpoise with the gyrating waves holding up this curious white concrete-and-glass structure. It was somehow so clean, so pure, yet overgrown with rotting vegetation and pouring with the musk of malaria and dank, rotting wood. Searching through the resort's courtyards revealed it to be utterly looted, raped bare of any valuables in its confines. Surrounded on all sides by unbearable swamps and bogs which would have begging even the toughest European, Young pondered how much pain must've been poured into this... thing's creation. Entire hotel-rooms were flooded with murky swamp water, presumably home to some terrifying, large and slithering Congo Lake-fish who festered in those dark and moldy places. Seeing Hans standing still in a hallway entrance, Young ran over to bare witness to yet more horror. Running through the hallway and the hallways connecting to it was an orgy of blood, a mob of resort occupants, maids, cleaners and waiters all cut down by machetes into a flowing river of organs, brain tissue and gushing blood. Flies coated the corpses, who seemed to be stuck forever running or crawling away from their gruesome fate. Hans looked on with impotent terror at his German brethren. Pushing Hans away from the sight, Young led him back to the patrol boat. They were getting lost, running out of fuel and in need of some direction.

They had entered a series of narrowing riverways in a desperate attempt to locate the village Leroy had pointed out on his map. Their supply of fuel, rations and, most importantly, cigarettes, heroin and LSD were slipping by the day. From beyond the wiry, snaking roots of the mangrove trees sung forth the might and awe of the animal kingdom in this alien, wild place. Nature and its envoys ruled these lands, as was evidenced by the ringing chirps, growls and roars of any number of fantastic beasts who managed to survive here on the meat of those weak. Leroy spoke in a somber, low tone "Everyone, look at the canopies." Lifting their heads upwards, Young and crew noticed the rotten, skeletonized corpses of men in SS uniforms hanging from their necks on tree branches dizzyingly high. Pigs took out a pistol for some target practice, only for Leroy to whisper-shout through his teeth "Put the goddamn gun down, we're close to our target and clearly these fellas ain't friendly." Floating along, the riverbed became shallower until the patrol boat was routinely dragging along the rocks and gravel floor of the riverway. Coming in contact with a foreign, burning sensation on their nostrils, the crew, after docking and trailing the scent, found a small, blown-apart collection of mud huts sitting within a grove. Leroy demanded he stay behind, lest something attempt to interfere with the patrol boat.\n\nTrudging around the mud huts, which sat unceremoniously plastered to the skin of these here swamps, Young and crew found nothing but shredded straw and a warm cooking platter, laid over a dying fireplace, coated with just-scattered spices. Nabbing a fistful of assorted fruits from a collapsed basket, Pigs made his way back towards the patrol boat, followed by the others. Singing and violent screeches emanated from the patrol boat's direction, and indeed, a mob of the native villagers surrounded the patrol boat. Pigs, dread lingering over his visage, knocked his way through the crowd. Finding the patrol boat pushed over its side, and its fuel storage cracked open and leaking, Piggs made his way around to its cockpit only to see the limp body of Captain Leroy laying on the riverbed, skull smashed open. Young and Hans, following in Pigs's steps, stopped in shock with the realization of what had taken place. Pigs, rage and rancor bleeding through his tinted aviators, grabbed the shoulders of a random, local child. Lifting a pistol to his forehead, the fruit scattered to the mud, Pigs screamed "You get what you b-bastards fucking deserve! You hear me? An eye for an eye!"

It scraped against their exposed skin, leaving it beaten and raw, caked in mud, shrivelled and reminiscent of trench foot over the whole body. This was a wasteland, a transitional zone between the Congo Lake and the outer tropics of Africa's interior. Hanging over it all was the blood-orange sun, breaking through layers of mist on the horizon to cast over the wastelands dark, deep and warm tones. Young, exhausted to the point of collapse, took a seat on a rotting piece of wood, sticking out from the wasteland like a splinter lodged into a finger's skin. Pigs took a seat with him, although Hans remained standing, indignantly remarking "You American bastards, I told you, we should be heading north-vest."\n\nPigs, dried blood running down his chin and torso, shouted back "And why should we listen to the kraut fucker who got us lost in the first place?

Clouds of red-orange vapor lifted upwards from the blackening grounds, only to be swirled around upon reaching the horizon's limit by blasting winds. Young excitedly prodded Pigs's shoulder, motioning for him to call down the helicopters. Pigs, snapped out of a euphoric delirium, searched through his pockets only to locate his bloodied pistol. Taking this as a last opportunity for safe haven, for life, Pigs aimed towards the last helicopter in the line and took several shots hoping one might call its attention. Watching, watching, watching the helicopters drag along the sun's surface, Young and Pigs broke out into furious celebration as the last in line turned away from the direction of the flock and instead towards them. It drifted forwards, its spinning blades and machine-gun turrets at last coming into view. Young and Pigs paraded, dancing the dance of famished and parched yet joyous souls... And then the bullets came crashing down. The helicopter floated above their heads, machine-guns reigning hellfire upon them. Mud exploded to and fro as Young and Pigs ran for the muddy swamp water of the bogs. The machine-guns tilted upwards, tearing through Pigs's mountains of flesh, scattering blood and bits wherever. Young tried to ignore the explosions of blood at his back, diving headfirst into the Congo Lake.\n\nDigging through layers of thick, sun-hardened mud coating the top of the Congo Lake as a film, Young broke through into a strange, almost-bubble of murky, dark blue lake water. Objects and assorted particles flew by his face, but these were not of a lakebed, but instead the gadgets and technology of civilization. Firearms, ammunition, watches, pieces of clothing and jewelry, rotting foodstuffs and plastic pieces. Scattered electrical lights, coming to life and then flickering back into the abyss, displayed a magnificent, ground-shakingly horrifying miles-long piece of artwork. A caravan of rotting flesh, a death march captured in perfectly still motion. Thousands upon thousands of doomed souls, nations of people, dragging along luggage, backpacks and panicked children.
