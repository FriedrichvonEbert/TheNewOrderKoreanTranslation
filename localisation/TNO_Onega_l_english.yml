 ### Politics Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KIRPICHNIKOV_DESC:0 "Before the Second World War, Vladimir Vasilevich Kirpichnikov was nothing more than an ordinary commander in the Red Army. Many thought he was destined to die as a hero of the Soviet Union, bravely fighting against the enemy, but that was not to be his fate. In the few months of fighting Russia experienced, before collapsing into chaos and warlordism, Kirpichnikov would lead the 43rd Rifle Division into battle against the Finns in the Karelian Isthmus. The superior enemy tactics would cause the Soviet front to collapse, and the 43rd Division was almost destroyed. Kirpichnikov was captured during the chaotic retreat, and would be interrogated and interned by the Finnish Army.\n\nThe major general would remain imprisoned, until the West Russian War came. Ever since the end of the war on the Eastern Front, Finland had been protected from the chaos in Russia by the Wehrmacht, but once the West Russian Revolutionary Front stormed the A-A line, Finland was in danger. Now, they could not simply trust the Reich to protect the frontier. To solve this problem, the Finns would gather the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard, a force composed of Russians in their territories and led by none other than Kirpichnikov himself. The promise made by Finland, which kept a tight leash on the Guard, was that should they drive the Reds out of Arkhangelsk, they could have the land to settle and be independent.\n\nNow, Kirpichnikov rules the small warlord state centered in Onega, and must stand up against the power that is the WRRF. The Finnish still maintain some control over it, but should Kirpichnikov's Guard liberate Arkhangelsk from the hold of the Communists, the Russians of Karelia might finally be free once again."

 ### Foci ###
 VTY_removetheradicals:0 "Remove the Radicals"
 VTY_removetheradicals_desc:0 "After the defeat and shattering of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the Finnish government of the Fifties decided, after the annexation of Karelia into Finland proper, to found the state of Onega. A pragmatic solution to contain the chaos of West Russia from spilling over to Finnish territories, it is the first line of defense should a power rise in the east, and threaten Finland itself. Staffed by Russian exiles from various parts of the former Union government, Onega only succeeds due to its political neutrality that ensures continued Finnish support.\n\nThis support must continue. The radicals from left and right must not be allowed to take power, lest they destroy the very foundations of the state it was created to contain. We must root them out from the government, from our political organizations, from our military structures. Perhaps then we can stand, not beholden to the left or the right, but ourselves alone."

 VTY_theendingstruggle:0 "The Ending Struggle"
 VTY_theendingstruggle_desc:0 "From the very beginning, Onega's mission as a buffer state is clear: to provide the first line of defense against the remnants of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, currently holed up in the cold northern Russian city of Arkhangelsk. Since its inception, it has been subject to raids, incursions, robberies, and attacks by the Front, in their attempt to gain more loot and resources to haul back to their lair. Against all the odds, Onega's struggle at containing the Front has been so far successful.\n\nHowever, the continued success of our policy is never guaranteed. The Reds right across our borders are not brutish enemies. On the contrary, they are vicious in their intellect and aggressive in ensuring that their revolution will survive to the present age. We shall update our policy of containment, and organize our men into labor battalions. It is time for us to make our stand as the last remaining beacon of free democracy in West Russia."

 VTY_ourfinnishbenefactors:0 "Our Finnish Benefactors"
 VTY_ourfinnishbenefactors_desc:0 "Without Finland, Onega would not exist. That is the simple truth of our circumstances. The current Finnish government continues the policy of disallowing Finnish citizens from serving in Onega and remaining neutral from all the chaos that emerges from West Russia, supporting no contender to power. Onega is a state of Russians, funded and equipped by the powers that be in Helsinki, and without their aid, we would have been just another territory absorbed into the Front.\n\nIt is not too late to better our relations with our western neighbors and benefactors. Russian diplomats shall grace their embassy in Onega, while Kirpichnikov shall send overtures and reassurances of continued cooperation personally. The fates of Finland and Onega are intertwined. If Onega loses, the dominant power in West Russia shall drag it into a war that it will not want to enter. If Finland cuts its support, there is no doubt as to what will happen to us."

 VTY_theredmenace:0 "The Red Menace"
 VTY_theredmenace_desc:0 "Before the Great Patriotic War, there existed a Union of workers and soviets that reigned from the Bering to the Baltic. Once the forerunner to fulfilling the dreams of the proletariat everywhere, the Germans have shattered this Union, and now warlords claim the pieces of Russia. As it stands, the largest remnant of Union authority in West Russia borders us, and, to put it mildly, they are not the friendliest neighbors by a long shot. Neither the people of Onega nor the Finns desire their breakthrough past our humble little state.\n\nAs such, we need to take measures to arm ourselves against continued raids and incursions coming from the Front. The sandbags shall pile high, and the men behind them will be prepared to open fire. Never shall they take what rightfully belongs to our people, and for every kilogram stolen, they shall pay for its weight in blood. Onega will endure, and outlive the specter of the lost Union."

 VTY_rootoutthebandits:0 "Root Out the Bandits"
 VTY_rootoutthebandits_desc:0 "Beyond Onega's frontline lies the West Russian Revolutionary Front: a terrifying foe, the most dangerous contender the old Union's legacy. However, behind the barbed wires and sandbags that dot our border with them is Onega's pervasive problem: banditry. Bands of armed men roam the wilderness, seeking to rob innocent men and women of their belongings. Occasionally, they chance upon an unguarded arms shipment, taking the rifles, ammunition, and various tools of warfare away from us.\n\nTo solve this problem, we have two approaches to pick: either the carrot or the stick. For the softer, less violent option we can bribe these vagabonds and outlaws into serving in our armed forces, in return for a pardon and a living wage. For the harder, more drastic option, we can increase our patrols, and finally root them out and crush them. Whichever we choose, the less effort spent on bickering amongst ourselves, the more room we have to fight against the Reds."

 VTY_promisethemdemocracy:0 "Promise Them Democracy"
 VTY_promisethemdemocracy_desc:0 "In our mission to guarantee stability to all that inhabit Onega, we have come upon an opportunity to legitimize us in the eyes of the public. Democracy is a strange concept to Russia: after centuries of imperial rule, followed by two decades of Soviet administration, the people of Russia have not yet truly experienced what democracy is and what it entails. Freedom of speech and expression might seem to an average Onega person to be pipe dream conjured from another realm.\n\nTo rouse the will of Onega to fight for its fate in West Russia, we can promise the implementation of full, parliamentary democracy, with legal rights that come with it. Once our long, seemingly-never ending struggle is over, the rule by the will of the people shall dawn upon Russia. Now that we have promised thus to the people, we shall herald a new era for Onega: where it fights not for ideologies or the will of foreign despots, but for liberty and freedom."

 VTY_wearefreedom:0 "We Are Freedom"
 VTY_wearefreedom_desc:0 "Our problem with the West Russian Revolutionary Front is apparent. However, if we were to take our eyes off them and glance at the regions of West Russia, we will discover that we are seemingly alone amid a sea of extremism. Communists, fascists, collaborators, monarchists, and followers of the German racial theory, surround us. West Russia was once a beautiful land, and now we stand within its ruins, a lone beacon of light and liberty for a people that has lost its purpose in the wars of the past.\n\nAll that reside in Onega, be they of Russian, Finnish, or Karelian origin, must know that we are freedom. Our Guards spill their blood in defense of ideas that others within Russia would not even stop to consider: liberty and democracy. Everyone else has taken the easy way out. In their pursuit of power, they have given no thought to the fate of the people. We are different, and we dare to defend it, to the final drops of blood if we must."

 VTY_expandcivilengineering:0 "Expand Civil Engineering"
 VTY_expandcivilengineering_desc:0 "During the times of the Empire and Union, the region of Onega only served its purpose as a middleman between the areas bordering Finland and the other, more industrialized parts of Russia. As such, the infrastructure that flows through it is sorely lacking, a holdover from the past. With the Finnish annexation of Karelia and the collapse and subsequent retreat of the Front into Arkhangelsk, Onega has taken the one place nobody ever expected it to claim: a strategic province that shields Finland from the horrors of West Russia.\n\nWith this new status in mind, Kirpichnikov has agreed to expand the civil engineering corps of the Guard. Throughout Onega, they shall build bridges, roads, and more general primary infrastructures throughout our territory to facilitate the quicker movement of troops and supplies to the frontlines. Should the Front or the other warlords attack, they shall not find the Guard wanting and unready."

 VTY_guaranteestability:0 "Guarantee Stability"
 VTY_guaranteestability_desc:0 "Onega might very well be the last bastion of protection against the horrors of West Russia, and the West Russian Revolutionary Front in particular. We are a candle amid dark, our faint light illuminating the way for those who walk with us, a plank of stability in the middle of a raging sea. If we are to defend ourselves, our people must first feel safe, away from the dangers that the warlords of Russia present.\n\nWe must legitimize our claim to our lands. The Finnish, the Germans, and the Russians will know that we are the last, best hope for democracy in West Russia. No more shall the days of banditry disturb and harass the common man of Onega. He shall feel safe, for all that look to the north shall not see only terror and horror, but a hand clasping a torch of liberty. The other shall wield a sword, and all that desire to extinguish the torch shall bleed and die."

 VTY_watchtheborder:0 "Watch the Border"
 VTY_watchtheborder_desc:0 "To go East, into deeper parts of Russia, someone from Onega would need to pass through the territory of the Front. However, Onega and the Front have vested interests in not letting each other through. Our border with the Front is lined with trenches, riddled with wires, and blocked by lines and lines of sandbags. Occasionally, however, due to the shortage of personnel on the part of the Guard, a Red Army battalion will sometimes make it through our lines and wreak havoc on the villages within.\n\nWe need to be more vigilant. Kirpichnikov will tighten his Guardsmen's schedules, working them around the clock to ensure that no harm ever comes to people of Onega. For the Red Army prisoners that we capture, we shall ask them to provide information for the next raids or death. Though it might be barbaric for Russians to execute one another without a fair trial, these are desperate times, and we will take harsh measures if need be."

 VTY_watchthecitizens:0 "Watch the Citizens"

While such means are sufficient for now, it would perhaps allow for a larger volume of aid from Finland to enter all-year if the ports could be used.\n\nLacking options for expansion without angering either the Finns or the Reds, it is now time to consider stopgap measures. To our west, a lake separates us from Finland proper. We will attach icebreakers on both our seagoing and freshwater ship, and shatter the ice that has so long blocked us to the outside world.

Why, Onega, of course.\n\nWhile Onega is admittedly a less-than-ideal place for them, perhaps it is not the end of the world to welcome them here.

They recognize the strategic value it holds for us, and are therefore doing all they can to keep us from reclaiming it.\n\nWith the formation of new Onega White Guard units, we are ready to tackle the Reds head-on. They may not wish to relinquish it from their hands, but if so, we are more than willing to take it from them by force.

With these factors in mind, we need Finnish instruction - surely, our closest ally would provide them at a lower price.\n\nWe will send the best of our negotiators to Helsinki, to negotiate with the Finnish government.

Unlike Onega, however, Finland has a functioning economy, free from the terror bombing the Germans inflicted on the rest of Russia.\n\nIt may be wise to consider aid from the Finns regarding this matter at this juncture. We will go to Helsinki and ask the Finns for their help. We don't have much time: the new developments in West Russia have made it plain that soon a power will unite the fractured lands.

As such, we must prepare for contingencies.\n\nIf the border posts of Onega fall and the invaders pierce deep into our territory, we shall make them pay for every inch of land they take from us.

The most significant, and hence the first industry that the government has decided to tackle, is the communal fishery system. We must conclude this matter and fast.

It comprised both the armed forces and the police, making sure that the communists in the regions that we controlled would not be able to organize or pose a serious threat to our power. For the past few years, it has certainly served our pseudo-state quite well in its capacity as both military and paramilitary and has served its purpose to satisfaction. However, after long deliberation, Kirpichnikov has seen fit to officially order the disbanding of the Volunteer Guard - in favor of the formation of an official civilian police force and a North Russian Republican Army, the NRRA.\n\nThis will ensure that a professional force - composed of many who were once in the Guard - will best serve the republic."

In reality, however, Vologda was effectively ruled with an iron fist by the military, which left it in a conflicting, difficult state.\n\nOn the one hand, the population has little issue towards our rule. On the other, however, there are a number of military holdouts, some as gangs of bandits and others quite large that roam the countryside opposing our rule and generally generating severe issues with our attempts at administering the province.

But just because their state has failed does not mean that the radicals within the area no longer pose a threat to our rule. In fact, if anything, they pose a greater threat than ever - the years of political maneuvering and posturing has left the more radical sectors of society quite well-equipped to stir the masses against our republic.\n\nThus, we need to compromise with what's left of the democratic center in Komi, and work with the local political elites to ensure our rule is one that is palatable to the population of Syktyvkar and beyond."

Had they not been destroyed forever by the fierce fighting, the signs would inform him that he was in Krasnaya Avenue, which was once bustling with life, but was now completely quiet. The city was still in ruins; buildings had been torn down and crumbled, while others had been gutted by the fires. One structure that had surprisingly managed to survive was a government building that had housed the Premier of the WRRF and its Politburo, and which was often called "the Kremlin".\n\nAs he walked up the stairs of the building, all he could think of was the final victory he had achieved. Years of struggle in the desolate lands of Onega had gone by, but now, his people were at peace. He could remember his days as a prisoner of war in Finland, and the promise their government had made; should you defeat the Front, you will have your freedom.\n\nVladimir entered the "Kremlin", and saw all the communist symbols and flags, some of which he ripped down. Behind him, a small escort of eight men followed, watching out for any dangers. As he continued to walk in the building, he closely observed the floors, the rooms, and the offices. Everything there reminded him of the war he had just fought - but thankfully won - and what that had taken. Above all, he was glad that all the Karelian Russians, that seemed destined to be forever stuck in the freezing lands of Onega could now enjoy a good life thanks to his accomplishments.\n\nThe general turned around, and spoke to his soldiers. "The Guard could definitely use a building like this!". They all laughed together."

It is no secret that the war against the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the "vanguard of socialism" in the region, has been a difficult struggle and one that has forced us to use everything we have at our disposal. After all, the Front is the remnants of the old movement from the days of the West Russian War, and it has finally decided to reclaim its place as a formidable power in the country. Thankfully for us, who have dared to challenge it, we have found an ally in this hostile environment, and it is the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard.\n\nToday, in one of the many recruitment centers we have set up to help in mobilization, over a hundred men appeared seemingly out of nowhere, requesting that they participate in the struggle against the socialists of the WRRF. When asked about their background, they made the situation much  clearer: they are proud Russians from Onega, the warlord state famous for resisting the Front against all odds with Finnish support.\n\nIt seems that General Kirpichnikov's regime has been successful in cultivating patriotic sentiment. Of course, our government and the high command have welcomed the arrival of the Anti-Communist Guard, and a special unit of Onegans has been quickly organized and sent to the front. While it may not be much, it is still useful in this war."

One day, a few blocks away from their leader's residence, over two hundred citizens had the courage to make a democratic protest, carrying all sorts of banners and flags, that more often than not were painted red.\n\nThe first hours of the protest were the most glorious. The self-proclaimed democrats went around the city, rallying the support of other brave Russians who joined the movement, fanatically yelling messages against the warlord government. This exponential growth would soon come to an end, as the demonstrators reached the central city square and met approximately fifty police officers, all protected by armour and armed to their teeth.\n\nTear gas was thrown on the demonstrators, many of whom were students, but they kept going, dedicated to their fight for democracy and socialism. As demands began to be drafted and declarations prepared, the order was given to the police stationed in the city center: break up the protest at all costs. Soon, the first shots were heard; panic ensued, many fleeing or engaging in hand-to-hand combat with law enforcement. The police had no intention of stopping, and so continued firing on the civilians until the threat ended. By nightfall, there was no one protesting anymore; everyone had fled the bullets, or had been wounded by them.

His boss, a pretentious, cruel little Finn called Kalle had chosen Matyev as his victim for that shift, berating him for hours about the efficiency of his work squad on the sawmill. Martyev had tried to explain to him that the efficiency at the sawmill was a matter of machinery, not of the operator, but Kalle would not listen.\n\nThe men that kidnapped Matyev drove up to him in a black van, speeding up along the foreshore. They jumped out of the still moving vehicle, three of them, masked in black and wielding batons. They were upon him before he realised what was happening, hitting him in the stomach and head so hard he passed out. When he came to, he found himself tied to a chair, his head throbbing and caked in dry blood. Directly across from him sat one of his kidnappers, his mask removed to reveal neat fair hair atop an angular, stern face. He spoke a phrase Matyev did not understand in Finnish to somebody behind, and suddenly he felt the cold steel of a gun against the back of his head.\n\nMatyev realised he was already dead. The man across from him would still be wearing his mask if they were not planning to kill him.\n\n"Slavik Matyev," the man opposite said, beginning what Matyev knew was his death sentence. "As per the Emergency Military Protocol of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard of Onega..."\n\nMatyev stopped listening, the droning of his executioner drowned out by a torrent of thoughts. Who had ratted him out? Probably that bastard Kalle. He had known that Matyev was a supporter of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Fuck. He should have been more careful. He should have just crossed the border and joined the Red Army like he had thought about so many times. Too late now.

It would be suicide.\n\nSo most days Dimitri spent watching the people walk by, and on the off chance anyone else had to enter the armory, he got to talk to them. He used to have to ask for their authorization, but not anymore. He still remembered the day where he had a great time beating up one person who tried to break in. Of course, they were an important government official and didn't need to be authorized, but it was still worth it. So currently, his job was pointless. But if he got paid, he didn't care.\n\nDimitri put his lighter away and thought of home. Or at least, what was left of it. After the bandits raided his farm and murdered his parents, he had no home to go back to. That's when he joined the Volunteer Guard. Although, he didn't expect to have to sit outside frivolous places like barracks full of guards or a secure armory in the safest place in all of Onega. Why wasn't Dimitri allowed to get his revenge and have a little fun? The rest of the guard was busy hunting bandits while he had to enforce order and wait for the bandits to come to him. While it might not be fair, at least they gave him a home here.\n\nDmitri waited for the end of his shift which was still five hours away. Perhaps one day he won't have to stand here for hours and stare at the other building across from him. At least a cat came by once in a while that he got to pet.

Not much activity had been through today though.\n\nA few hours passed and a truck finally came to a stop at the checkpoint. The chief officer, Grigori, walked over to the driver as Andrei went to the back of the truck. Just another search. However, it was a bit strange for a supply truck to arrive at this time of night. They must be really behind schedule.\n\nThe driver kept arguing they didn't need a search, and they were already authorized to bypass this checkpoint. After too many complaints of them being late and that the food was going to spoil, Grigori gave up on the search and walked back to the checkpoint to let the barrier up. But that was against protocol. All vehicles needed to be searched by the checkpoint before they were allowed through. Andrei knew something seemed off about this.\n\nWary but unsure if it meant anything, Andrei took matters into his own hands and forced open the back of the truck. Three distinct human shapes were visible in the darkness, but before he could figure out who they were, a shot rang through his ears and a scream came from Grigori.

It is how the Finnish are able to send us supplies and manpower, and the only suitable route to send troops through quickly. If it is damaged we could face serious consequences. The Guard must not let that happen.\n\nMultiple bases have been set up along the railroad and guards have been sent to secure the stations.

At first it was unassuming, just another home on top of a hill. But the guard knew, it was chock full of bandits. It was strange to see them just out in the open like this, almost as if they are waiting to be attacked. Shouldn't they be living underground in some dark and grimy cave instead of this beautiful, large white house? They should at least be smart enough to hide and lay low, but perhaps these ones aren't too bright. After all, bandits usually aren't the smartest.\n\nA shocking charge would do the trick, those bandits would surely be outnumbered. Once every man stood ready, the assault commenced. More than a hundred Volunteer Guards charged up the hill and the slaughter began. Machine gun bullets rained upon the attacking troops from positions in the windows of the house, striking them down as if they were little toy soldiers a child would play with and flick them over with their finger. This was supposed to be just another hideout with a few careless bandits with hunting rifles. Not a well-armed fortress full of bandits with large machinegun nests. How did the bandits have this type of weaponry? Not even Onega's garrisons are this well-equipped.\n\nAlmost as quickly as they had begun charging up the hill, the brave Volunteer Guard was fleeing down in terror. But it wouldn't end there, even as the Volunteers reached the bottom it went on. The barrage of bullets wouldn't end until they made it back to their camp, exhausted and covered in blood.\n\nThe dead and missing were accounted for and the Guard finally got a chance to rest. Later that night a communication was sent out to the next regiment commander.\n\n"We failed again, the soldiers acted more like scared little girls than fearless men. It's your turn now. They might have a weak spot towards the south, towards the lake. Fewer windows there. I just wish we could get some artillery here and bomb them to smithereens.""

This was one of the last major hideouts that had not already fallen to the guard. It was almost a cave, dug into the earth and hidden with branches and leaves. To be honest, it was a pretty good hideout. It had taken forever to track down, even with directions on how to find it. But with the Volunteer Guard finally outside, those poor bandits had no idea what was coming for them.\n\nThe elite Volunteer Guard broke through the barriers before the bandits even knew what hit them. The Guard had learned a lot about the bandits, spending so long hunting them down that every volunteer was an expert in the bandit's tactics. Clumsy bandits had no chance compared to the best Volunteers in Russia.\n\nWithin a few minutes almost every bandit was either dead or captured, with few guard casualties. Even more good news, the men recovered many stolen goods the bandits had captured. Money, personal belongings, and expensive commodities are now in the hands of Onega's best. Our leadership has to decide what to do with it all, give it back to the people, or keep it for ourselves. That is, of course, whatever the guards don't decide to keep.\n\nBut for now, let's celebrate one of the first of many victories to come over the bandits. No more ambushes, no more dead guards, and no more burning homes. "

With a difference of more than eight percent, the Republican Party of the Russian North has won, and as its head I will be inaugurated as President. I wish to thank you all for your political participation, and I promise to you that you will not regret this vote.\n\nI have stood for the Republic since its foundation, ever since we set foot on the banks of the Onega River and began the struggle for liberty. The Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard has made a valiant effort to liberate the region, and now that it has succeeded, the people seem to have considered its leader as a fit candidate for President.

 VTY.19.desc:0 "Vladimir Kirpichnikov stood in his frigid capital of Onega, overlooking one of the many barracks within the town reserved for the troops of his Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard. The Guard had been his work - the creation, organization, and recruitment of soldiers into it; it certainly hadn't been an easy task. Truthfully, ever since his capture and imprisonment by the Finns, Kirpichnikov had missed organizing and commanding troops.\n\nBut even then, with the "gift" that they had bestowed upon him, he was reminded of the true nature of his post. He was well-aware of his being little more than a pawn to the interests of Helsinki. And he was just as aware that his actions in Onega and beyond had been more than mildly authoritarian. He was a military dictator, simply put, and one propped up by the Finnish government at that. It was a position that caused him great ambivalence; on one hand, he could protect those within his fiefdom and serve the interests of Karelian Russians. On the other, he only did so as a means to Finnish ends, and any dissension - especially from communist elements, wasn't tolerated. The stern look on Kirpichnikov's face as he looked down on his Volunteer Guard training betrayed few of the emotions that he felt. Ultimately, the ex-Soviet general thought to himself, his position as leader of the Guard wasn't one that sat right with him in his gut.\n\nA trumped up dictator based out of the small timber town of Onega was hardly a fitting or prestigious legacy for a Soviet commander. But Kirpichnikov had little love lost for the Soviets, under Bukharin but even more so under the military rule of Kliment Voroshilov, who had treated the Russian people with all manners of cruelty during the German invasion. Snapped out of his thoughts by a subordinate's call, he banished his ambivalence to the background of his mind and began his weekly inspection."

 VTY.20.desc:0 "The board within Vladimir Kirpichnikov's humble office was filled with maps, all of which were covered in drawings - offensive lines, fallback lines, predicted encirclements. If one was not well-versed in the reality of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard's situation vis-a-vis manpower and equipment, one would think that Kirpichnikov was preparing a real offensive eastwards. Unfortunately, most of what Kirpichnikov had drawn up was entirely unrealistic. His more cynical commanders would even suggest to one another, well out of earshot of their leader, that his planned offensives were little more than pure fantasy.\n\nBut what was the man to do, if not wargame? His Guard ran on autopilot - the result of his nurturing a strong and relatively independent command structure, and Kirpichnikov had never been a micromanager anyhow. But, as the leader of the Finnish satellite state often reminded himself, the Finns had promised him something: his freedom, and the freedom of a subsequent government, if he was able to take Arkhangelsk and end the West Russian Revolutionary Front once and for all.\n\nPerhaps it was the general's old guilt and ambivalence that translated into his ambition to take the city and end the Soviet remnant once and for all, thought many of his subordinates. To a degree, they were right. None of the Volunteer Guard's officer corps had any love for the Finns. But what the officers didn't know, is that Kirpichnikov was more motivated by a hope for redemption, rather than by guilt. Oftentimes, late at night, when sleep eluded the aging general, he would walk, in the cold night air and without any guards, to his office, and look over his plans, imagining the aftermath of his fictional victory. It was during one of these nights that, despite his ambivalence for his own role and weariness regarding the Soviets, he resolved that he would beat them or die trying."

Looking up at the aide who had brought him the news, the first words out of his mouth were not what the aide expected. "How the hell are we hearing this from Helsinki, and not our own people?" the aide didn't have an answer - he, nor anyone else, had the heart to tell the general that the Volunteer Guard's spy network in the Front was notoriously ineffective. "Regardless," Kirpichnikov began, rubbing his right temple with his hand. "This news is... Voroshilov... dead..." the general's mouth stretched downwards as he became lost in thought.\n\nThe pair of men had once been comrades, serving the Union and her people alongside one another. Things had been different then, Kirpichnikov reminded himself. But that didn't stop the general from reminiscing about his past, when he fought for, rather than against, the Soviet system. He barely muttered "dismissed" to the aide as he looked down at the neat typeface on the telegram. As he heard his office door shut, he reached down in his desk and opened a drawer, carefully pulling out a neatly-wrapped cloth. Unfolding it revealed a creased picture, well-worn with time. Kirpichnikov gently took the picture and unfolded it. Kirpichnikov could still make out the faces, the smiles. His one comrade waving at the camera. It was just after he had been named commander of the 43rd Rifle Division.\n\nHe looked at the photo for what must have been ten minutes, reliving the moment. The photo had begun to fade, but the memory was as crisp in Kirpichnikov's head as if it had happened just the day prior. The happiness he had felt, the sense of accomplishment. Things he hadn't felt for quite some time. Voroshilov's passing may have presented both an opportunity and a change in the Guard's strategies, but Kirpichnikov decided that all of that could wait for one day."

 VTY.22.desc:0 ""What the hell is this?" the leader of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard yelled at the aide who had the misfortune of delivering the telegram to him. Kirpichnikov was red in the face, an unusual departure from his normal, calm-and-collected affect.\n\n"It's... it's a telegram, sir, from Helsinki." the aide responded, nearly shaking from nerves.\n\n"I know what it is... it was a rhetorical question." Kirpichnikov said, his anger quickly depleting. "Get out of here." he dismissed the aide in an abnormal, unprofessional fashion. "Damned Finns. How do they expect me to handle this?" The Finnish government had expelled another three villages' worth of Karelian Russians to his territory to make room for more Finnish settlers. As more Russian refugees arrived in Onega, they brought with them almost nothing, and needed a lot in return. Food, shelter, water, all things that were in short supply in the town of Onega and what little territory Kirpichnikov controlled. He cared for the refugees, as he would any Russian. But the rate at which the Finns were shoving them into his territory was becoming unsustainable. He sat at his desk and began typing at his typewriter. Angry letters, all capitals, addressed to the Finnish government and their leader, Karl Lennart Oesch.\n\nBut as he typed, Kirpichnikov's anger slowly left him. He was brought back to the days of his imprisonment, and the way the Finns had treated him. He remembered his personal "chats" with Oesch, at that time a mere general in the Finnish army. One memory burned brighter than most: Kirpichnikov had been starved for days, only being given food after posing for a photograph - lighting Oesch's cigarette. A coup d'etat for Finnish propaganda. He couldn't go back to that. Ripping the page from his typewriter, he crumpled it up, and went to work finding resources for the refugees he couldn't support."

Standing in the ruins of the hospital in Sharya, not far from Vyakta, the old general looked down at the floor. Good God, was it really? Nikolai nudged some rubble with his boot, overturning the masonry to reveal the ash and dust covered tiles beneath. His eyes grew wide, it was! The hexagonal tilework with its alternating blue, yellow, and white hexes brought him decades back. He remembered clutching a shattered wrist, a wound from a Nazi bullet, his guts held in by his belt. Barbarossa had just begun, and Omelin's battalion had been rolled over by panzers, his comrades killed or scattered. Nikolai continued to walk the halls, listening to the stutter of jackhammers and the whining of drills.\n\nHe remembered the pretty nurse who helped stuff his entrails back in, the buzz of the lights and the shouts of the surgeons. A miracle, they had told him, almost impossible that he was alive. Young Nikolai should have been grateful, ecstatic, but he could only remember staring at those damn floor tiles.\n\nStrange, that fate had brought him back here. Strange, too, that his gut and wrist squirmed with remembered phantom pain. As the men of Onega worked to bring the bombed hospital back to working order, Omelin looked out west, towards where Germany lay. Such death and horror had spewed forth from Berlin, and it could again. Nikolai Omelin swore that such a nightmarish tide would never reach Russia again."

A smile crept over his creased face.\n\nThe entry in question described Pyotr's adventure deep into Red territory with his one-time companion, the spy Paul Dukes. Pyotr and the Brit had gotten along famously, and the two had embarked on numerous missions against the hated Bolshevik menace. Those had been days of heroism and daring, both thrilling and invigorating in equal measure.\n\nPyotr sighed, letting out a cloud of pipe smoke as he did so. He wondered what his old friend had been doing all these years. Was he a collaborator in the English government? Perhaps a brave freedom fighter in HMMLR? Who could say?\n\nPyotr eyed the journal in his hands. It was a shame to let such exciting tales go to waste in the mind of an old man. When this was all over, Pyotr resolved to himself, he would write a book about his adventures with the spy. Why not? He had all the information he needed in the book resting in his hands."

In terms of appearance, he recognized much. The hill itself, of course, the spire of the town church, the strange wall that one of the more eccentric residents had built to 'protect' his garden from children such as himself.\n\nBut he quickly found that he no longer recognized the people. The eccentric resident was gone. As was nearly everyone else he remembered. Confused, he had demanded answers of those encountered, and in short order discovered the reason why he no longer knew his hometown's inhabitants. They had been, nearly to a one, replaced.\n\nSince his last visit, the Finns had displaced the Russians in Povenets, including his own friends and family, that had lived there since time immemorial. In their place were Finnish settlers, encouraged by their government to venture into Karelia and further secure it for their Republic.\n\nOmelin had been struck nearly speechless, and unsure of how to respond, had departed shortly thereafter. During the return journey to Onega however, he quickly found himself unable to feel anything other than disgust. Was this what he had been fighting for?

That was, until the Guard was forcibly dragged into conflict when the rising power in West Russia decided it was time to show its power by invading us, and Finland as well. They thought victory was certain, but they were wrong.\n\nSoldiers of the Volunteer Guard march in Arkhangelsk, Vologda and Syktyvkar. The previous overlords of West Russia are no more, their leaders and generals having fled amidst the chaos. Now, it is up to us to pick up the pieces in the region, and create a new order clean of Bolshevik autocracy. As our men restore order and hunt down bandits in the war-ravaged territories that have fallen under our control, General Kirpichnikov has made a symbolic gesture and declared the North Russian Republic. From Arkhangelsk, the former stronghold of the WRRF, he made an address where he formally announced the creation of this state and made promises for reforms and democracy.\n\nIn the lands further from Onega in the south, imposing our control has been more difficult.
