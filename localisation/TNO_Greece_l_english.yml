 POLITICS_SOTIRIOS_DESC:0 "그리스국의 수상을 역임중인 소티리오스 고차만니스는 아직도 살아있다는 사실이 놀라울 따름이다. 1958년 이래로 이 불쌍한 수상은 뇌졸증에서 완치되지 못했다. 이런 건강상태에도 불구하고 그는 아직까지 단 한 번도 대체된 적이 없다. 이와 같은 사실을 통해 그리스의 현재상황을 짐작할 수 있는데, 제2차 세계대전이 끝난 이후 추축국에 의해 세워진 협력정부는 아직까지는 이탈리아 왕립해군(레지아 마리나) 덕분에 종속하고 있지만 지금 그리스국은 빨치산과 민병대가 언덕과 산을 누비며 도시 시민들의 불만은 점점 커지기만 하고 있다. 그덕에 그리스국은 내부적으로 극심한 불안정상태를 유지하고 있고 이런 그리스국에 안정을 가져다준 유일한 사람이 사망한다면 필시 혼돈을 불러 일으키게 될 것이다.\n\n과거 이탈리아에서 의사 공부를 했던 고차만니스는 협력정부에서 훌륭한 경력을 보냈고, 아틀란트로파 건설로 인해 그리스국 전체가 황폐화 되었던 50년대 중반, 그리스의 총리가 됨으로써 그의 협력정부 경력의 종점에 다달았다. 그 이후로 고차만니스는 그리스국의 내부상황을 반란이 일어나지만 않을 정도로만 아슬아슬하게 유지하면서 이탈리아의 지배자들을 만족시켰지만, 국민들은 여전히 협력정부를 혐오하고, 실업률과 경제위기는 아직도 치명적이며 빨치산과의 전투도 멈추지 않고 벌어지고 있다. 더 최악인 점은 자기 이익만 챙기기 바쁜 협력정부의 정치인들이 고차만니스의 후계자를 미처 마련하지 못했다는 점이다. \n\n모든 그리스인들은 뭔가 안좋은 일들이 곧 벌어질 것이라고 짐작하고 있다, 빨치산과 민병대의 침묵은 그저 고차만니스가 사망하면 닥쳐올 폭풍 직전의 고요에 불과하다."

 gre.1.t:0 "과도정부 수립 선언!"
 gre.1.d:0 "To look at the recent change in the state of being as a singular revolution might be a bit misguided. Certainly, revolution occured in Hellas, but it was far from a unified effort. Though the plain cross of EDES, the crowned cross of Organization X, and the standards of various defecting army units and Security Battalions marched side-by-side into Athens, their visions for the future of the nation clashed drastically. \n\nIt is perhaps a mercy that the bulk of all the revolutionary forces converged on the capital at once, so that none could claim legitimacy over their ideological rivals. The only thing that they agreed upon was that this was not a republican, a monarchist, or a militarist revolution, but a Hellenic one, and it would be there that common ground was found. \n\nOut from the Hellenic Parliament, once a bastion of cronyism and corruption, emerged the leaders of revolution. Komninos Pyromaglou, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Georgios Grivas, and Georgios Papadopoulos walked in the sight of revolutionary, civilian, and hastily-assembled press alike on the steps, hands clasped in hands. \n\nAs one, they raised their fists to the sky, and with this firm display of revolutionary solidarity, they proclaimed with one voice the formation of a new provisional government to oversee the Hellenic state. The government would be modeled like the Parliamentary Democracies of Pre-War Europe, and as a People, they would decide what the path of Hellas would be. \n\nThe fate of Hellas is far from certain, but now more than ever, the people of the nation have hope for the future. Now it is time for Hellas to move forward once more. "

 greneg_ita_ciano.1.t:0 "The Final Orders"
 greneg_ita_ciano.1.d:0 "Greece has been gripped by chaos, as partisan groups wreak havoc and are coming closer and closer to seizing control of the country with every day that passes. The collaborator government is equally worried as we are, and has sought the protection of the Italian garrisons in and around Athens, that, in combination with the Security Battalions, are the last hope for our allies to maintain control. However, even that chance is slipping away. After months of endless fighting, our troops being constantly assaulted, ambushed and routed, Attica is the only true stronghold we can rely on.\n\nEven though occasional rumors of partisans carrying out resistance activity in the suburbs of the capital have reached Rome, the area still remains the only one we safely hold. Thus, we must make our decision on what our response will be. The High Commissioner to Greece, Luigi Mascherpa, who represents our interests there, has remained neutral on this issue so far, awaiting for a response from the government, but he seems to possess a better understanding of the situation on the ground.\n\nThe honorable Admiral and his closest advisors have debated the best course of action for days now, and little seems to have come out of it. As the National Resistance closes in on the capital, and threatens to end the EEE government, an immediate order to the Italian garrison must be sent. What shall it be?"
 greneg_ita_ciano.1.a:0 "Surrender your weapons to the resistance fighters."
 greneg_ita_ciano.1.b:0 "Shoot if only it's absolutely necessary."
 greneg_ita_ciano.1.c:0 "Open fire on the resistance and fight back."

 greneg_ita_ciano.2.t:0 "The Talks Begin"
 greneg_ita_ciano.2.d:0 "Behind closed doors and in dark alleys, there are talks of a final peace between the Italian Empire and the Greek resistance. Once having to hide behind the mountains and the woods, the partisans of the EDES and the EAM have nothing to fear anymore. They have not only openly engaged in "a war of liberation", but now can claim to be the legitimate government of the nation.\n\nThey have done just that, in fact, as the Provisional National Democratic Government has been formed in the Greek mountains. Before any power and influence Italy can exert on its former ally ends forever, Duce Ciano has decided it is time to hold actual negotiations on its future. As our best diplomats work day and night to contact the provisional government and begin talks, a formal conference must be arranged if we are to sign lasting peace.\n\nMany ideas have been thrown around about the location of this conference, and it has now become a question of whether we want to have the upper hand by holding it somewhere we have control, or hold it on Greek land. Where shall we organize it?"
 greneg_ita_ciano.2.a:0 "In a government building in Athens."
 greneg_ita_ciano.2.b:0 "In the battleship Vittorio Veneto, in the port of Piraeus."
 greneg_ita_ciano.2.c:0 "In the La Canea military base, in Crete."

 greneg_ita_ciano.3.t:0 "The Question of the Prisoners"
 greneg_ita_ciano.3.d:0 "For years, our endless struggle with the Greek Resistance, aside from little success in dealing with them, this war has also given us a great number of captives, that are held as prisoners in mainland Italy or Greece. Whether they are republicans, communists or monarchists, they all want to get their freedom back and return to their homeland, and so does the victorious resistance.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn't be so quick about returning them, as they could still be a bargaining chip in negotiations.\n\nTalks between the Italian government and the united front of Greek rebels continue, and it is in our best interest to have the high ground in negotiations, or at least that's what some claim. Many others have also voiced their support for showing our good will to the new regime in the Balkans, by releasing them or at least promising to do so soon. The best course of action is to be decided by expert in foreign affairs and our leader, Duce Ciano."
 greneg_ita_ciano.3.a:0 "Release them immediately."
 greneg_ita_ciano.3.b:0 "Make a promise to release them once the talks are done."
 greneg_ita_ciano.3.c:0 "Keep them as captives for now."

 greneg_ita_ciano.4.t:0 "EAM Ramps Up Activity?"
 greneg_ita_ciano.4.d:0 "The EAM has made itself notorious to the Italian forces stationed in Greece. Created by the communist party at the very start of the occupation, its aim was to become a "popular front" that would unite all ideologies to achieve a common goal the nation's liberation. This was never achieved, as most of the center and the right looked to alternatives such as EDES to join. However, that did not stop EAM from growing more and more, becoming the first resistance organization to shift from a small circle of select units and guerrillas to a nation-wide movement that encompassed every corner of the country.\n\nThe fall of the collaborationist regime in Athens has changed the situation dramatically, as the socialist organization is free to continue building up troops and influence in the government. This has made some people in the cabinet and the army rather worried, even afraid that it puts the carefully built order in the Balkans in danger.\n\nRecently, we were approached by a group named the "Sacred Bond of Greek Officers", also known as IDEA. They are a group of ambitious military commanders in the mess that is the current Greek army, and they have dedicated themselves to fighting communism. They have been the ones to inform us of the latest EAM operations, and have even offered to help in the investigation.\n\nThe troops of the National Liberation Front, especially active in the mountainous areas of Greece, have amassed significant support and are possibly preparing an offensive, both literally and figuratively, to seize control of the Provisional Government. The Servizio Informazioni Militare has been assigned to finding information about this threat, but has found nothing so far and would require deployment in Greece to figure out what's going on. At the same time, IDEA still wish to lead the charge in the investigation without raising much suspicion."
 greneg_ita_ciano.4.a:0 "Order SIM to thoroughly investigate the case."
 greneg_ita_ciano.4.b:0 "It'd be preferable to use the valuable resources on something more important than this"
 greneg_ita_ciano.4.c:0 "Contact IDEA so they can lead the operation."

 greneg_ita_ciano.5.t:0 "Military Presence in Greece"
 greneg_ita_ciano.5.d:0 "As negotiations continue between Rome and the united front Greek insurgents, a tough question has been set by the other party: what shall be the fate of the Italian presence in their country?\n\nEver since the Second World War, when Italian troops completed their glorious invasion, dozens of military bases, installations and outposts were established, with the goal of protecting the collaborationist regime from both internal and external threats, and maintaining order in general. Obviously, this mission has failed, as is evident by the fact we are currently negotiating with the new regime that overthrew our allies. Still, the question of what our garrison force will do once Greece gains its full independence remains.\n\nThe Greek negotiators have been quite insistent on Italian withdrawal from their soil, but there is still room for deciding the exact details of that. For example, High Commissioner Mascherpa has suggested a program by which Italian military presence will be reduced to 30% of its original size. This way, we might be able to appease the Provisional Government, but still maintain some troops there. Of course, there are always more extreme options..."
 greneg_ita_ciano.5.a:0 "Agree to withdraw all troops within a year."
 greneg_ita_ciano.5.b:0 "Agree to significantly reduce our presence."
 greneg_ita_ciano.5.c:0 "Our bases in Greece are all staying there."

 greneg_ita_ciano.6.t:0 "키프로스 문제"
 greneg_ita_ciano.6.d:0 "The island of Cyprus, which has a Greek majority population, was awarded to the Hellenic State with the conclusion of the Second World War. It could be considered a compensation given by Italy in exchange for the territorial losses the nation experienced, but now, the drastic changes in mainland Greece have made the "Cyprus Question" surface in international affairs again.\n\nThe delegation with which we are negotiating was the one to bring up the matter of the island, citing that it is technically Greek land - even though in reality, the Italian garrison held most power. Their proposal was the maintenance of Enosis, the term for the union with Cyprus, as a concession by Il Duce. What we have mentioned as a counterpoint is the great difference between the situation there and in Greece itself. While the partisans have seized control of the mainland, Cyprus is still under our firm control. Even though EOKA, the radical group advocating for Enosis, has intensified its activities as a result of the victory of the resistance, it has not been enough to force us to evacuate.\n\nThe possibility of a democratic plebiscite has also been considered by diplomats of both countries. A referendum organized jointly and held under the supervision of our garrison seems like a good middle ground, and it would show our commitment to liberty and justice. However, we should keep in mind that, if the Cypriots are given a choice between staying in the Empire or joining Greece, the majority will likely vote for the latter."
 greneg_ita_ciano.6.a:0 "Enosis will be fulfilled, as a concession."
 greneg_ita_ciano.6.b:0 "Organize a plebiscite."
 greneg_ita_ciano.6.c:0 "Make no promises regarding the island."

 

 greneg_ita_scorza.1.t:0 "Greece Erupts Into Insurrection!"
 greneg_ita_scorza.1.d:0 "Democracy has failed once again, this time, in the place of its birth. The coalition of various rebel forces that overthrew our puppets in Athens have not been able to unite behind a strong leader and as such, have predictably fallen into infighting and chaos. \n\nWhile no one in Italy would shed a tear for the gaggle of rebels and opportunists that have turned on each other, the situation is worrisome. Greece is a nation that is within the traditional Italian sphere of influence, whose loss would not only deprive the empire of another market and its resources, but would also potentially destabilize its Balkan neighbors. \n\nIt's clear that intervention is the only choice, Italy's prestige demands it, but high command is split on how to proceed. Until the situation solidifies, everyone agrees that a defensive posture is needed, and to this end, two plans have come to the fore.  \n\nThe first would establish what is referred to as the "Sulla Perimeter" around the City of Athens. A precarious position and difficult to hold, but our continued occupation of the city would prevent any of the rebels from gaining legitimacy by taking the capital.  \n\nThe second is the "Salamis Perimeter", where we create a flexible and easily defended perimeter around a section of the Aegean Retreat, which we simply hold until the situation becomes more clear and we can begin to make plans.\n\nUltimately, the final decision falls to the Duce."
 greneg_ita_scorza.1.a:0 "Approve of the Salamis Perimeter and retreat to Piraeus."
 greneg_ita_scorza.1.b:0 "Defend Athens and establish the Sulla Perimeter."

 greneg_ita_scorza.2.t:0 "Formulate A Contingency Plan"
 greneg_ita_scorza.2.d:0 "With the situation rapidly deteriorating on the Greek Peninsula, simply holding the line against the rising tide of chaos is only delaying disaster. If Italy is to restore order to Greece and secure her sphere of influence, an offensive strategy will need to be formulated and agreed upon. \n\nOne major wall that high command has run into is whether or not we should recruit and involve collaborators from Greece in the operation. While this is standard practice for Italian interventions in other regions, the fact of the matter is that every time that the Italian Empire worked with Greek collaborators in the past, they'd gotten burnt for it. In fact, even the rebels they were planning against right now had former collaborator elements as part of the rebellion.  \n\nA number of hardliners argue that the plan to restore order to Greece cannot involve Greeks, and that their presence will only subvert and compromise any attempt to keep the Peninsula in check. Then there are those who are of a more conciliatory mind, accepting that the Greeks had proven untrustworthy in the past, but arguing that the downsides to an only-Italian operation outweigh the problems that involving the locals on the campaign and occupation would cause. \n\nEither way, Italy will face fierce opposition from an incensed and defiant Greek people, but this decisions could make the difference between a stable, friendly Greece, and a hostile, mutinous one. No one knows which path will lead where, though, and the Duce will need to make the final call."
 greneg_ita_scorza.2.a:0 "If we aren't working alongside some familiar Greek faces, the people will only resist harder. We need the Collaborators."
 greneg_ita_scorza.1.b:0 "The Greeks have had their chance, and they refuse to behave. We will handle this in the Italian way, and leave the Greeks out of it!"

 greneg_ita_scorza.3.t:0 "Issue an Ultimatum"
 greneg_ita_scorza.3.d:0 "We have ships moving into position to the east and south of Athens, and boots on the ground are starting to gather on the Hellenic coast while the Royal Air Force dominates the sky above the turbulent peninsula the rebellion has taken control of. It's going to take some time, but we will soon be ready to move against the rebels, but before we do that, we ought to draft and deliver to them a list of demands. If we can avoid a fight, we should do so. \n\nOf course, it's easy to decide on the bulk of the demands. The standing Greek rebels will stand down, Italian forces be allowed to re-establish control over the peninsula, the formation of a new government underneath Italian supervision, that all is well and good. But the question of amnesty has proven to be difficult to come to an agreement on. Some argue that we need to take a hard-line stance against the ringleaders and generals of this rebellion, if we are to prevent the same thing from happening again, or happening in other parts of the Empire's sphere of influence. Others argue that an offer of amnesty would- should the leadership of the rebellion refuse, allow disillusioned and forward-thinking generals to defect safely and make the campaign that much easier. \n\nSeveral Greek leaders- in particular, notable Security Battalion veterans and other former collaborators- have already expressed interest in laying down their weapons in exchange for guarantees from the Empire, one such leader has even suggested that he could mediate negotiations between the two sides. These statements only serve to both enrage the hardliners, and simultaneously encourage the more lenient commanders."
 greneg_ita_scorza.3.a:0 "Amnesty will prevent a great deal of needless bloodshed and allow us to begin the statebuilding process more quickly."
 greneg_ita_scorza.3.b:0 "If they wanted mercy from the Empire, perhaps they should have considered that before taking up arms against us."

 greneg_ita_scorza.4.t:0 "Orders ot the Regia Marina"
 greneg_ita_scorza.4.d:0 "From the bow of the Impero, Athens looked much smaller than it had when he'd left it. Then again, Admiral Luigi Mascherpa hadn't expected to ever return to the city. He only wished that it hadn't been in order to hold a gun to its head.  \n\nThe bay south of Athens was littered with the cruisers and destroyers of the Regina Marina, as well as the occasional supply convoy making its way towards Hellas to supply the Royal Army present there. For simple police action, the sight of it conjured long-buried memories of the sounds and smells of the World War. \n\nThe Admiral peeled his eyes from the city and to the man in charge of the operation, Admiral Antonio Legnani. A cruel and harsh leader by all accounts, but those traits were expected out of a submarine captain, no matter how high they rose afterwards. Even still, Mascherpa made his appeal.  \n\n"I strongly urge you to reconsider this, Admiral. Th-" \n\nLegnani interrupted, as he often did during these conversations. "Do you now? I must not have noticed the last hundred times you urged me, but now that it's a strong urging..." His mouth twisted into a mocking smirk as he spoke.  \n\nWith an accusing finger gestured at his fellow admiral, Mascherpa's voice rose. "The Impero is clearly visible from the city, the Hellenes see the guns, they see the ships, our point is made! There's nothing to gain and much to lose by shelling the city!" \n\nLegnani shook his head as his eyes turned out towards Athens. "What good is a threat if they don't believe we will follow through with it? I think your time among the Greeks has made you sentimental, admiral." \n\nThis wasn't the first time that Legnani brought up Mascherpa's time as the High Commissioner in Hellas, but that didn't stop him from taking the bait. "It is not sentiment, only practicality!" He spat back. "We'd only serve to embolden the rebels and drive more Hellenes to join them!" \n\n"And is this simply a civil disagreement? We're here to punish Greeks, not befriend them." He turned on his heels before Mascherpa could respond. "Besides, it's too late. I've already requested permission from the Duce. Best hope the Duce loves the Greeks as much as you do, my friend." Mascherpa could practically hear the condescending smile on his face as he walked away."
 greneg_ita_scorza.4.a:0 "We're here to keep the peace, not rack up a body count. Let the presence of the guns speak for themselves."
 greneg_ita_scorza.4.b:0 "Open fire and let the Greeks know the cost of defiance."

 greneg_ita_scorza.5.d:0 ""In the Spirit of the Ancient Bond between Rome and Hellas, lay down your arms!" Was written in bold, Greek letters beneath a colorful drawing of two hands shaking, each of them showing the colors of the Italian and Greek flags. As gaudy and ostentatious a thing as Ernesto Botto had ever seen.\n\n"Always with the Ancients..." He muttered as he pinched the bridge of his nose with his free hand, handing the flyer back with the other. He shifted his weight onto his right leg, the sound of the iron prosthetic causing the floorboards beneath him to creak quietly. "When did we turn from an Air Force to school teachers?"\n\n"I just thought they might be more receptive to-" The man from Ministry of Popular Culture began to make his retort, but Botto was already walking away.\n\n"We need to remind them of their hopeless position, paperman," called back Ernesto "Iron Leg" Botto on his way out the door, "not of factoids. Try to have something worth its ink when I return, or else explosives may replace your papers."It wasn't a long walk from the offices to the armory, though to call either makeshift, hastily erected front line structure by their name felt severely inappropriate. Botto gave the doorless frame of the building a knock as he entered, seeing that there was no one to greet him, he made himself at home instead.\n\nBombs were lined up against the far wall of one of the few additions onto the building made out of concrete, bombs that should they be needed, would blast Athens to rubble. But something seemed... Off about them. Upon closer inspection, the reason became obvious. Painted on each of the bombs was a seemingly personalized message.\n\n"Stay in Your Caves" on one, and "This One's for Gotzamanis"; "Augustus is Back" sat next to "Pyromaglu! Suck my Cock!". Apparently, the pinnacle of wit and cleverness that you could expect out of Italian bomber crews.\n\n"Commander! I didn't hear you come in!" Piped up the quartermaster, scrambling up behind Botto, only to follow his gaze and realize what Iron Leg was reading, and his complexion began to whiten.\n\n"I am... Curious, quartermaster. What exactly is the value in these... Writings?"\n\n"Insults to demoralize the Greeks when we bomb them, of course."\n\n"I see. And... They are supposed to read these... When, exactly?" Botto turned his gaze back to the quartermaster, who had no response save to rub the back of his neck nervously. "Just get the men back to work, we need to drop something, and if it isn't bombs, they may very well be papers instead.""

 greneg_ita_scorza.6.t:0 "Orders to the Regio Esercito"
 greneg_ita_scorza.6.d:0 "For the time being, there was a small piece of Greece that belonged to Italy. From the Italian-dominated waters of the Aegean marched the Boots of the Regio Esercito. While for now they had to set up shop along the barren coastline of the Aegean Retreat, the time for organization was ending, and the time for action was beginning.\n\n"It is always better to act in reply." Two men marched along the coast, two of the principal commanders of the upcoming battle, named Operation Corinth, Enrico Martini and Tito Agosti. The two men could not be more different, and that was reflected in the argument that they currently had.\n\n"Reacting is what you do when you are on the defensive, Martini. In case you haven't noticed, we are the invaders here." Agosti retorted, a finger pointed towards Martini's chin.\n\n"And what more would a partisan love than to see a column of tanks roll right into their traps? We should hold and let the rebels show their hand, they will no doubt be eager to retake the land we've occupied already."\n\nAgosti looked out and into the Greek interior, before gesturing broadly to the vague silhouette of Piraeus's harbor in the distance. "Look at it, Piraeus sits there, ripe for the taking. It is near enough that we don't need to fear your terrifying partisan, and its fall will send a signal to the rest of the rebels."\n\n"It's a foolish decision. There's no point in taking Piraeus without having some idea of the ability of the Greeks to make a counteroffensive. We'd only be overextending ourselves!"\n\n"We could extend ourselves along the whole of Greece if we should wish it. You underestimate your own men, Martini."\n\n"I'd rather underestimate my own gun than underestimate the gun pointed at me.""

Rampant corruption and cronyism have tarnished the image of the collaborator government, while harshly repressive laws, the continued presence of Italian soldiers and a terrible economic situation have driven many Greeks to join the resistance."

 GRE_the_cyprus_situation:0 "The Cyprus Emergency"
 GRE_the_cyprus_situation_desc:0 "While the island of Cyprus was formally handed over the Greece following World War Two, the situation on the ground is much more complex. Italian troops were stationed in Cyprus in large numbers, and as elsewhere in Greece, a nationalist resistance began to form, under the aegis of a group called EOKA. Their rising prominence and power began to scare the large Turkish community of the island, which formed a paramilitary of its own, TMT, leading an insurgency of their own against Italy and EOKA. When the Triumvirate was formed, Turkey demanded to station a garrison in Cyprus to protect the Turks of the islands against EOKA - however, there are rising suspicions that the Turks are secretly aiding TMT as well. In the end, the island was locked in a deadly and complex struggle between the Italian garrison, EOKA, TMT and the Turkish troops, which is a constant and significant strain for Turkish - Italian relationships."
