Nobody quite knows what will happen next, and all sides seem to be waiting for the other to take the first breath."

As the populace has begun to come to terms with the reality of military rule, and with the idea that this may be more permanent than some had initially hoped, demonstrations, riots, and overall resistance now threaten to break out across the nation.

For the first time in months, shops and workplaces forced to shut down in the panic find themselves slowly reopening, and while the constant presence of the military in the streets hasn't subsided, they find themselves able to keep order even without employing the more brutal tactics that they have so often used. It may be slow going, but the people of Brazil finally have started to accept military rule."

Quadros' Lusotropicalist behaviour won him the graces of Caudilho Salazar, who granted him the medal of the Military Order of Christ. In 1955 he won the graces of the paulistan electorate and won the city mayoral election and finally ran as Juracy Magalhães' vice president in the 1960 election.

Campos worked actively with other liberal politicians to end the dictatorship, being elected a deputy in 1950 and governor of Minas Gerais in 1955, his path towards the vice presidency was consolidated.\n\nCampos carries a strong distaste towards Varguism, both for its authoritarian measures and nationalist rhetoric.

During most of the New State dictatorship, he kept a low political profile working for private banks and firms, finally joining the newly created PSP party in 1950.\n\nAs Adhemar's minister of economics, a strong supporter of Petrobrás and the continuation of the industrialization of Brazil and already possessing some experience on political matters, Barreto's extensive knowledge has allowed him to use Adhemar's influence and corruption to support his plans with more efficiency than he would have under any other President.§!"

In the aftermath of the war Kruel became one of the most inspirational anticommunist and antifascist officers, documenting every suspect from his wide range of informants and ruining the careers of many in the process.\n\nWhile Kruel has his own ideals, his actions are sometimes driven by the interests of local oligarchs and friendly politicians, having worked with members of the Superior War School on every single coup attempt through the 1950s and 60s. His ministry is seen by many as the antithesis of what Lott planned, promoting the politicization of the army and it's cooperation with foreign - especially American - agents.§!"

It is up to see if his promise can be kept, or if Brazil will remain under the American umbrella for the foreseeable future.§!"

After serving at various foundations, Furtado was appointed the Minister of Economics of Juscelino Kubitschek, where he established the Plan of Goals and directed his Five Year plan for economic development.\n\nFurtado's objective is to build a great power out of Brazil, comparable to the USA or Japan, a country where the poorest don't suffer from hunger, and the richest don't have to deal with his plans failing, a "patriotic and humane capitalism" if you will. His plans, however, usually hit the wall of reality by not reaching the designed goals and being plagued with the constraints of corrupt government officials and lack of a specialized workforce, but Furtado is adamant that the dream is possible one, and with enough effort, Brazil will be not the country of the future, but the country of the present.§!"

Fearing the growing influence of fascism within Europe affecting Brazil, his fears amplified following the Estado Novo coup only a year after he had been able to return.

With the definitive end of the dictatorship, he became a founding member of the UDN.\n\nNow, after the military coup, Juracy has been appointed as Minister of the Exterior by General Castelo Branco.

 brazil.1.t: "The Lobster War"
 brazil.1.desc: "Lott was sat reading the latest documents that covered his desk. New reports of piracy and illegal fishing just off the coast of Pernambuco had been reported to the government. Their main ports of origin, the German colony of Zentralafrika, and the numerous West African states. Lott coughed before saying "This is a matter of national security, we have to stop this 'Lobster War' immediately."\n\nAcross his desk sat Odílio Denys, his War Minister, who was smoking a big cigar, and whose face had grown angrier as the meeting went on and the numerous reports of the breach of Brazilian waters had been discussed. Right next to him was Admiral Arnoldo Toscano, the man who was dealing with these threats in the north. Toscano looked exhausted, with dark circles under his eyes. Notably Vice President Quadros was not there, Lott having decided not to invite him to this meeting.\n\n"I have been trying to stop it." Arnoldo Toscano said, "I have already directed for two destroyers to confront the pirates and fishermen, but this latest resurgence is more widespread than we had thought initially."\n\nOdílio chuckled at that and muttered under his breath "The might of the Brazilian Navy can not defeat a few pirates, unbelievable." Lott gave Odílio a quick but stern glance and did not say anything in response.\n\nArnoldo continued, undisturbed by Odílio's comments, "Pirates continue to harass our fishermen and attack tourist boats. It was only a few months ago when the wealthy Japanese couple had been taken hostage by pirates while out whale watching. This has only emboldened further pirates to harass our waters, there are simply too many for just two destroyers to deal with. Meanwhile, subsistence fishermen from West Africa and large commercial fishing ships from Zentralafrika continue to illegally enter our waters to take large amounts of fish, the Zentralafrikan ships mainly for our prized lobsters. As I have stated two destroyers are simply not enough, I am requesting a larger task force to stop this threat once and for all."\n\nLott remained quiet, thinking about all the possible courses of action and what may happen depending on his choice. After about ten seconds, Lott spoke."

 # Quadros' Resignation
 brazil.2.t: "Calling Lotts Bluff"
 brazil.2.desc: ""Sir? Um... Vice President Quadros just sent in his resignation." Lott stared at his secretary hanging in the doorway, and slowly collapsed onto his desk. "Thank you, Maria. Take the day off." She nodded, and closed the door behind her. After a moment, Lott pulled his head upright, stood and walked to his cabinet. This was hardly a surprise, really. Quadros had threatened Lott with his resignation for a while now, citing the Presidents 'bastardry', a phrase he actually used in front of the entire staff. Who knows, if Lott capitalized on this fast enough it might even play out in his favor. If the next Vice President was even slightly more cooperative then Quadros, or could even speak Portuguese legibly, imagine the things he could do!\n\nLott pulled open the bottom-most drawer, revealing his favorite cigar box. It was a brand he could only get in Italy, and he liked to save them for particularly interesting situations. As he cracked the window, he realized that the situation might be more interesting then he first assumed. A crowd was gathering outside, waving signs and chanting something. Lott saw what, or rather who, they were cheering for before he could make out the words. Every other sign featured a stylized portrait of Jânio Quadros, smiling his stupid little grin.\n\nLott spied Maria inching around the crowd on her way out, and resolved to pay the poor woman more. "MARIA!" She darted her head around and stared up at him incredulously. "GET BACK INSIDE, I NEED YOU TO CONNECT ME TO QUADROS!" The crowd cheered at the sound of their broom messiah's name, and Lott slammed the window closed again. He sighed, closed back up the cigar drawer, sat back in his seat and stared at the phone. Damn the man, but the people loved him."

He slowly, ever so slowly opened the door, and once again breathed the air a Vice President breathes. Quadros coughed. It smelled like shit in here.\n\nWhen he put in his resignation, Quadros may have sold it a bit too hard. Last he saw his office, it was littered with broken glass, the trash can was upended and he may or may not have kicked a hole in the wall. Most of it had been cleaned by now, but there was still some garbage littered about. Luckily, in their ordered expulsion from his office, the cleaning crew had left some tools. Quadros opened the windows, took up the fallen broom and went to work.\n\nJânio enjoyed cleaning, to tell the truth. It felt orderly. Structured. So unlike everything else in Quadros' life, cleaning had a certain goal and a certain end. As he swept up the last of the trash in his office, Quadros took a moment to pat himself on the back. It was difficult, but he deserved it. He was one step closer to President!\n\nResigning was quite the power play, but damn if it hadn't paid off. Lott had practically begged him to come back, with a strained tone of absolute hatred that Quadros absolutely relished. Still, this wasn't even close to the end. He righted his seat, sat down and began to dial Lacerda. Quadros had made a bold move today, but it was time to get even bolder. After all, a President needs to be decisive."

 # Follow Up to Henrique Lott intro event, or the Quadros Intro event
 brazil.4.t: "Distractions"
 brazil.4.desc: ""Yes Quadros, what is so incredibly urgent?" Lott laid back in his chair, eyes closed. Jânio Quadros was hardly his idea of an ideal vice president, but like it or not, Quadros was who the people wanted. Could he be effective, on occasion? Certainly. But Quadros could also be... abrasive.\n\n"Lott, I have been, hic, waiting for two hours! Listen, listen, are you listening? These Argentinians, they're building this dam, right? And it'll be bad for us, for Brazil. Terrible! So I need your signature, or something, to get them to stop. I think. You took a very long time, SIR."\n\n"Wha- Jânio, are you drunk?" Lott was irritated, he had sent Quadros to Argentina to negotiate with them over the dam, not to get drunk.\n\n"You took too long! So yeah, I had a little drink. Tiny. These, these Argentinians, blech, they aren't going to see me until tomorrow anyway, why not? Four hours ago, when I started calling, I was sober, you just took too long."\n\n"This is entirely inappropriate, Jânio. I don't even understand what you want from me, lets have this conversation tomorrow."\n\n"BULLSHIT! I've been calling for eight hours Lott, just say the thing! Say, um, that I can do it. That I can pay back construction costs? I think that's it. Say it. Say it, come on. They make me pay to make calls from here Henrique!"\n\n"Fine, fine! Do what you need to do, Jânio. But tomorrow, I need a full report on whatever it is you're trying to tell me. Understood?"\n\n"Yes. I will do those things. Goodnight, Henrique. Thanks. Be quicker next time." Quadros said before hanging up."

 # 1962 Election Season Ends
 brazil.18.t: "Brazil Votes"
 brazil.18.desc: "The election season has finally finished as the Brazilian electorate goes to vote. Campaigners and activists put down their leaflets and placards and have a rest from the campaigning. While politicians nervously await the election results, to see whether their career has ended in tatters or they have been elected once again. Meanwhile, the media give a running commentary and report on the results showing which politicians won in which seats and what major upsets there have been. Ambassadors and foreign agents all quickly scramble to gather what limited information there is to see the future direction of Brazil. No matter the result the Brazilian people have voted and the Brazilian people will get the results they voted for, let us hope that it was a wise choice."

 # Green Hell Trans-Amazonian Highway event
 brazil.6.t: "Green Hell"
 brazil.6.desc: "Luis paused to wipe the sweat from his brow, disturbing the coat of dust that had caked there throughout the day. Surveying the segment of gravel that had been his day's work, he gave a tired sigh. Nearly identical gravel patches had stared back at him at the end of every workday over the past four months. Finally the sun was beginning to set, and in the distance he heard the welcome rumble of approaching trucks, signaling the end of yet another long day of road-building.\n\nIn the hours it took to return to camp, Luis' mind wandered far from the cramped truck bed. He fished a small photo of his girlfriend out of his pocket, enclosed within a locket that had become his only reminder of life back home... He turned the locket over in his hands, as if after all these weeks he would spot some new detail he hadn't yet noticed. Luis couldn't stop thinking of their last days together. She had argued fiercely when he told her he was taking the job, disparaging the highway as "Lott's folly." Ha. She had always been smarter than him, more political. No matter the politics, no matter the argument, they needed the pay. Luis resolved to call her tonight, check how her mother was doing. Maybe.\n\nAs the truck clattered to a stop, just beyond the BELO MONTE sign, Luis noticed a small crowd had gathered next to another of the trucks. His heart sank when he saw that a body, horribly disfigured, was being lifted out of the bed. He pushed through the small crowd to have a closer look, and soon learned from the chatter that the corpse was one of the tree-choppers. Or, used to be one of the tree-choppers. A jaguar had ambushed him away from his team. He never stood a chance.\n\nLuis couldn't bear to keep looking. He pushed through the crowd and made for the mess hall. He had decided to make that phone call. At times like this, Luis was thankful he was one of the road crew; the mosquitoes and natives were already enough to worry about."

 brazil.7.t: "The Fascists Move"
 brazil.7.d: "Walter Salles sat across from Lott in the President's office, a sheaf of papers clutched in his hands. He spread them around the desk, a collection of graphs, reports and intelligence maps. "This is everything we have on the South African War. The US is almost certain to intervene along with the rest of the OFN shortly, but even without German support the Schild has the upper hand."\n\nPresident Lott sifted through papers for a while, examining each document in turn and asking an occasional clarifying question. These were the sorts of problems Henrique Lott excelled at solving. Troop movements, logistics, naval clashes, native resistance and foreign intervention. The SAW was a mighty puzzle, but as Lott examined the collected reports, he realized a piece was missing. The OFN was on the backfoot. Democracy was on the back foot, and so Brazil was on the back foot.\n\nLott stood, suddenly. "Let's take a walk, Walter. I have some ideas I need to air." Salles followed after him, as they made their slow way out of the building. As soon as they were outside, Lott began to speak. "We are removed from the Eagle here, Walter. South America has already faced German aggression, the war will stop this. But how long can the civil war last? The Germans are at their weakest point in decades, but they are already rebounding. Standing by would be criminal. I... I'm rambling, Walter." He suddenly turned around and stared at Salles. "No matter what happens, I will not allow Fascism to extinguish another democracy. Brazil will stand with South Africa, or you can call me Henrique Silva.""
 brazil.7.a: "They walked for a while, discussing how they would spin this intervention."

 brazil.9.t: "The Lights of Rio"
 brazil.9.desc: "Francisca, one of the millions crowding Rio's Copacabana Beach to celebrate the advent of a brand new year, cheered as the first of the fireworks began to light up the skies. She kept her three children clustered tight to her against the flow and crush of the crowd, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians who traveled to the beach from miles around to share in the joy of a new year. Food trucks and tents set up all over the white sands were left empty, as their owners joined the raucous celebrations. The fireworks were absolutely magnificent this year. Vibrant greens, blues, reds, every color imaginable lit up the skies, banishing all of Rios darkness. For Francisca, this year had brought far too much of that darkness into her life. But now, as Rio was filled with light, her own problems seemed to evaporate in the glow.\n\nBrazil was not kind to single mothers, but Francisca, surrounded by hope, felt accepted for the first time in decades. Things would be different tomorrow. She would take her children back to the cramped apartment they called home, go back to six hours of sleep desperately taken in between constant work, go back to watching rich men walk past those even worse off then her without even a glance. But as she watched the brilliant lights of a new year light up Rios sky, Francisca thought about how things were slowly getting better. Everyday things seemed just a bit cheaper, every paycheck just a bit bigger, the world just that tiniest bit more equitable. Despite everything, she was proud of her country. So long as Brazil kept to its course, Francisca might just be okay."
 brazil.9.a: "Hope was in the air."

 brazil.11.desc: ""...Thereby, I promise to protect Brazil, protector the interests of the army and protect the future of the fatherland against it's politicians on my new position, being eternally vigilant against communist infiltrators, traitors and rebellious civilians on my ternure as General." said Sylvio Frota, after receiving his new promotion as a General of the army after the death of General Ancora a few days prior.\n\n"This is really bad..." said one officer on the back, close to his friend, Silva "He is not even pretending to like democracy."\n\n"We have fought worse..." said Silva "I am just getting a bit tired now, you know?"\n\nMicael knew exactly what Silva was talking about. The Brazilian Army never had been a unified institution, being divided into many different factions since it's creation. For decades supporters of democracy have tried, sometimes with success, other times not so much, to prevent tiranny from taking power. First the Sword dictatorship under Floriano Peixoto the butcher, then Arthur da Silva Bernardes and his martial law, followed by the New State under Vargas and now the escalating military radicalism by people like Frota.\n\n"There is no way to fix this permanentely, Silva." continued Micael "I'm afraid that the only way is to continue this war forever."\n\nAs Frota finished his speech and returned to his bench, everyone got up and began to applaud his figure.\n\n"I know, but what was that thing that that random American said... I think it was...""
 brazil.11.a: ""The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.""
 
 brazil.12.t: "The Sword Retires"
 brazil.12.desc: "Odylio was in front of the podium, on his front there were 500 cadets of the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras, on their perfect white uniforms awaiting for him to say. He still had memories from fourty years before when he was as young watching Marshall Setembrino de Carvalho retire, he didn't expect time to fly so much.\n\n"...I have fought for my country through all the battlefields possible, as a cadet against the old republic, as a officer against the nazis in Britain, as a Brazilian against the corrupt politicians that pollutes our country, as a father against the socialists who want to corrupt our youth with their insane doctrines, and a lesson I learned and still carry with myself is that our country will always be persecuted by enemies from the outside and the inside, and thus my retirement might be the end of my fight, but it is the beginning of yours!"\n\nA massive applause started through the whole room, Odylio could see the pride and respect on the eyes of everyone on the room, true Brazilians, respectfull Brazilians just like him. People who would pave the way for the country in the future and continue his mission, the good fight for their home, the home of their ancestors and the home of their children. Soon he wouldn't be on earth anymore, but his soul would continue alive through every single man on that run."
 brazil.12.a: "And after finishing his speech, Odylio wept, for his mission was over."

 brazil.13.t: "The Real Work Begins"
 brazil.13.desc: "Li drifted in and out of consciousness, catching bits of conversation and activity as they drifted past him. Muttered curses, a loud belt of laughter, metal on metal grinding. His lean-tos fabric walls provided no shelter from the sounds of daily activity, as he tried desperately to catch some sleep for the upcoming shift. He was on the night crew at this section of the Highway, tasked with clearing debris and paving, where the budget allowed. Their funds had been a lot barer recently, as the poor bastards up north finally started construction. At least he only had to pave over savannah down here.\n\nLi was finally falling back asleep when a sudden jolt shocked him awake, falling out of his hammock with a shout. He scrambled back to his feet upon seeing the source of his rude awakening, the titan of muscle and ill-fitting clothes that served as his crew boss. Manuel glared down at Li, his scarred hand still wrapped around the strings connecting Li's hammock to the lean-tos poles. "Bad news son. They just took one of our dozers, meaning everybody gets to start work two hours earlier. I've already heard every other fuck in camp bitch about it, so do yourself a favor, get ready and shut it."\n\nWith that he stomped off down the line, shaking awake the other members of night crew. Li sighed, and started pulling on his gear. Wasn't right to make an anchor watch man work while the sun was still up. Not right at all."

 brazil.14.t: "What Have They Ever Done for Us?"
 brazil.14.desc: ""So, with all that out of the way, does anyone have questions?"\n\n"GET FUCKED!"\n\nGilmar smiled awkwardly at the profane, shriveled farmer woman at the front of the crowd. What was she, eighty? Whatever she was, she led the coalition of local farmers, natives and incredibly bad-mouthed elders that had shown up in force to brigade Gilmar's announcement. When he got the news that the Trans-Amazonian Highway had finally been hooked up to Maraba, and that he was scheduled to make the announcement, Gilmar had been very excited. It was a chance to see the public, to get some well deserved publicity! He expected cheers, flowers, general excitement, anything but... this.\n\n"YOU CUT MY GODDAMN FARM IN HALF JACKASS!"\n\n"HOW MANY MORE TREES ARE YOU GOING TO CHOP DOWN DUMBFUCK?!"\n\n"ONE OF YOUR IDIOT WORKERS LET MY COWS OUT, THEY'RE FUCKING GONE!"\n\nThe crowd of dirty peasants had shoved their way into the middle of the crowd halfway through his speech, and hadn't shut up since. Gilmar knew that there was some unrest about the Highway, but seeing it manifested like this was unnerving. It was probably time to make an exit. Wait, was she holding a rock?\n\n"Uh, thank you, that is all!"\n\n"ASSHOLE!""

 brazil.15.t: "The Worst Is Yet to Come"
 brazil.15.desc: ""Manaus is officially connected to the Highway, gentleman. Cheers!" The small group of politicians, engineers and foremen downed their drinks in one swift motion, celebrating yet another stretch of the Trans-Amazonian Highways completion. Cutting through a large swath of the Amazon, these past months had been particularly difficult. Unfortunately, the worst was yet to come.\n\nLingering in the back of every one of the revelers minds was the grim understanding that these last sections of the Highway were going to be... difficult. Though they had already breached the Amazon, the next step would take already exhausted workers and failing equipment into the deepest, darkest parts of the greatest jungle on Earth.\n\nThe politicians, snazzy in clean suits and judicial in their drinking, were dreading it the most. It was their job to sell the last stages of the project to a populace that had expected it done with years ago. The engineers and foremen were more optimistic. Looking at it on a map, this was old hat to them! They had already cut their way through half the blasted rainforest, what was this last stretch to them?\n\nTheir workers had been set loose on the city for a week, as the expedition repaired and readied itself for the upcoming months. Celebrations filled the streets as hundreds of men drank their worries away, spent their accumulated paychecks and enjoyed the company of Manaus' finest performers. They were going to enjoy their respite for as long as they were able to, trying to ignore the choking jungle all around them."

 brazil.20.t: "Little Wooden Boats"
 brazil.20.desc: ""We're getting nowhere, Henrique." Odylio Denys was a broad man, the type of man who was quick to anger and faster to laugh. He could always be trusted to speak his mind, to tell a colleague exactly where they fell down and where they excelled. Though they were in many ways opposites, President Lott had held Denys as one of his closest friends for years. Unfortunately, Lott didn't have the capacity for his War Minister's bluntness at the moment.\n\nBoth men were hunched over a large war table, depicting the waters affected by Brazil's latest national emergency. Wooden figurines of the proud Brazilian navy lay scattered on its surface in the latest rough battleplan Lott had devised, an attempt to halt the thousands of pirates infesting Brazilian seas and stealing Brazilian capital. Already, the pirates had taken millions of dollars worth of fish and lobster from Brazil's waters, putting hundreds of fisherman out of business. Lott had been repositioning the figures with Denys' input for hours, to no avail.\n\nThe President sighed. "Resources are limited, Odylio. We have to find a way to end these pirates with our current taskforce, unless you have ships we can reassign in your back pocket." Denys folded his arms and stared intently at the largest cluster of ships. "Defense is getting us nowhere, our destroyers are wasted trying to screen out every ramshackle pirate that steals from us. We need to strike at where they take their product, the German vessels and pirate convoys. Attack, not defend."\n\nDenys had preached his aggressive tactics throughout their planning, but Lott was unconvinced. A more diplomatic approach, if he could make it work, might solve the problem without sending every Brazilian sailor thousands of miles from home. The remnants of Free France still held a decent amount of ships, and surely the Germans weren't completely unreasonable? One thing was certain. The Lobster War had to be solved immediately, before any more lives were lost. "Fine, lets co-"\n\nSomeone was knocking at the door, quite insistently too. Denys walked from the table and flung it open, revealing a nervous looking secretary. "What? The President asked not to be disturbed." The secretary nervously smiled at him, peeking around the bulky door to stare at the President. "Sir?""

 brazil.21.t: "A Victory for Diplomacy"
 brazil.21.desc: ""Control, the helicopter has touched down in Reclife and the hosta-sorry, former hostages are on their way back to the Japanese Embassy. We did it gentlemen." The room burst into cheers, as Brazil's biggest diplomatic headache was solved. Months of negotiation, threats and tracking had finally paid off. Two Japanese tourists on vacation, the daughter and son-in-law of one of Japan's richest men, had been kidnapped by pirates off the Brazilian coast for ransom four months ago. The Japanese began pressuring and even threatening the Brazilian government within days, demanding the tourists be found and returned immediately. The situation, already a massive incident, was further complicated when it was revealed that the pirates were hiding out in Free French waters, sheltering behind a tiny but aggressive navy that had no interest in ousting the pirates for free.\n\nIn the end no shots were fired, but millions of dollars were spent on bribes, information, appeasement and overtime. Brazil's relationship with Japan would forever bear the black mark of this crisis, but at the moment none of the beleaguered diplomats in the crisis room could bring themselves to care. Most of them were operating on two hours of sleep, and the older members of the diplomatic corps had already begun filtering out of the room to catch a well deserved nap. The rest were celebrating a hard fought victory, a statement to the world that Brazil could solve its own problems, without and even in spite of German and Japanese interests. In a way, as the newest member of the diplomatic corps would refer to it later, it was another victory in the long struggle against Fascism."

 brazil.22.desc: ""Hello my friend! This is your Governor, Adhemar de Barros. I'm calling to bring up an arrangement we had spoken about earlier, with-". The man on the other end, a prominent business owner and politician in São Paulo, hung up. Adhemar stared at the receiver for a solid five seconds, before sighing and crumpling back in his chair. "Gahh, shit." He picked up his pen, crossing out a name on one long list and adding it to another. "One more traitor."\n\nEver since his loss in the election, many of his more tenuous supporters had swapped sides. He had been calling jumped up bureaucrats for hours now, putting on his usual easy air of confidence with increasing difficulty. Adhemar wasn't made for calls. He wasn't made for fake niceties, for endless appeals to idiots with frail egos. He needed to be out there, shaking hands and kissing babies, leading a rally or inspiring a crowd to action. Action! Worthless bureaucrats weren't going to win him his rightful seat, action was.\n\nAdhemar leapt from his seat and strode quickly out of his office, beckoning for his secretary right outside to follow him. Surprised but not unused to these kinds of outbursts, she hurriedly grabbed a stack of papers and awkwardly vaulted her desk, running after him as he ducked into the hallway. "Take the rightmost sheet off my desk and print thiry, eh, fifty copies. I trust you still have the list of instigators?" "Uh, yes." "Good, good. Give them a call, tell them to ramp up recruiting and rallying. It's time to pull this back."\n\nAdhemar was already climbing into his car when he turned back around, with a slight grin. "I'm going to go stir up trouble. Collect as much scratch paper as you have for when I get back, it's time to revise old plans and draft up new ones. Adhemar is back.""

 brazil.23.t: "Little Acts"
 brazil.23.desc: "Goulart's day had been going well enough- he woke up with a firm understanding of what the day would bring, he spoke with friends over when he would meet them next, and he was almost at work by the time that he tripped. Why it became such a bother to Goulart was what he tripped on, just next to a dark alleyway- it was the foot of a man, laying in the mud. Before he could even stumble to the ground, Goulart's hands shot out in front of him.\n\n"Shit, sorry, that's on me." Under a small newsstand's worth of newspaper, the man seemed to be laying down as though he was hiding from bloodhounds, or a bear, as the mud beneath him squished as his hand was laid back into the watery dirt. It was insulting to even see- someone laying perfectly still in the mud. Goulart was taken aback, more than anything, before reaching out his hand. "Here. Up." With a sigh and a heave, the two men were standing next to each other, one looking considerably worse for wear than the other. The man seemed to be only partially protected from the mud, still, some swathes of it covering his back, which Goulart couldn't help but feebly trying to wipe off the mud. "You alright?"\n\nThe man stood with a look in his eyes that Goulart was pained to even see. His mind flew to the speech he was to give later today- wiping off the mud on the poor man was more than enough to let his mind fly to the Auro and those bastards on the other end of the PSD that let him lay there. Goulart could already feel some new "adjustments" being given to his speech he was already uncertain of.\n\n"Sure, just fine, thank you." The look in his eyes, that of a man betrayed a thousand times over, offered one last betrayal, and revealed how the man had been laying there. Goulart checked his watch. Five minutes. "Listen, there's a kitchen down the road and to the left, get yourself cleaned up, and I'll meet you there in an hour." The man looked at Goulart with what anyone could see as appreciation, even if he didn't say a word."

Carlos Lacerda clapped his hands and wrote a name atop the large blackboard at the front of the crowded meeting room. HENRIQUE LOTT. Lacerda had set thirteen of his best journalists on investigating every dirty deed, backroom deal and possible scandal Brazil's current president had even possibly been involved in. Now, they were ready to present their findings. Or rather, their lack of findings.\n\nWhen nobody spoke, Lacerda threw his hands up in the air. "What? You've been looking into this reprobate for months now, give me something!" A nervous looking woman near the back of the room cleared her throat and shakily stood up, as all eyes turned on her. "Uh, sir, we regret to inform you that we found, umm, almost nothing sir. As far as we can tell," she looked expectantly at her vaguely nodding counterparts, "Lott is clean. The only concrete accusations are all very minor, nothing worthy of even a tabloid. As far as we can tell, the man is untouchable."  She sat back down, and the awkward silence resumed. Lacerda looked around the room, and sighed. "Christ, I don't have time for this. I had to put off a meeting with my poverty counsel for this, you understand? Rio has the highest rates of unemployment and homelessness in the country, and I should be dealing with it right now. Instead, I'm talking to a group of professional simpletons!" A young man in the front stood up, his face fixed with embarrassed indignation. "What the hell do you want from us? We can't just make shit up!" Lacerda laughed, and took back up his chalk. "Watch me."\n\nLOTT SEEN WITH WOMAN HALF HIS AGE! LOTT, PATRIOT OR CIA SPY? FRAUD PRESIDENT STEALS VOTES! LOTT BOUGHT? On and on Lacerda wrote, covering the board in eye-catching headlines and random accusations, until every inch was covered by a story. Lacerda turned back to the crowd, now staring at him with a mix of disgust, apprehension and a strange kind of excitement. "Get writing, I have a city to fix.""

Quadros had arranged a visit to the East, for the stated purpose of bettering relations with the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nHis visit began as more of a tourist visit than a diplomatic mission, taking sight of the Forbidden City, where he visited the museum and witnessed the great many cultural artifacts of China's imperial period. There was then a fine dinner in the Brazilian embassy with the President of China, Gao Zongwu, the Brazilian Ambassador Sérgio de Queiroz Duarte, and the Sphere Representative in China, Takeo Miki. The dinner was filled with much amicable discussion among all those involved, with Brazil's intentions of a deeper relationship with the Sphere being made openly and explicitly.\n\n"We are shared in an anti-imperialist struggle," the Ambassador said, "and we look to deepen our relationship with like minded nations, those who have shared our struggle against colonialism. May we stand as brothers!" The comments made the intentions clear; too clear, as this was contrary to the interests of the United States, and contrary to the opinions of many domestic citizens; many groups, especially pro-OFN and left-wing organizations, slung around accusations towards Quadros such as "Nazi!" or "Japanese Bootlicker!", along with other words the newspapers were not allowed to publish.\n\nFollowing the dinner, in an unpublished event, Quadros, Gao and Miki met in a private office to discuss trade specifically. Upon his return, Quadros regarded the trip, talks included, as a great success."

 brazil.26.t: "Splitters!"
 brazil.26.desc: ""I declare this meeting adjourned!" João Amazonas slammed his gavel again and again, desperately trying to stop the riot brewing at the Brazilian Communist Party's latest emergency meeting. He commanded a significant sect of the Party, and would be its de facto leader, if not for the sectarian bastard currently standing atop the bars central table. Luis Carlos Prestes, a naive splitter that had for a long time commanded a sect opposed to Amazonas and his coalition of realists within the Party. Tensions had simmered in the Party for a long time, but yesterday's incident had... escalated the situation.\n\n"Put that fucking gavel down João, you goddamn tyrant! This isn't over until your goon is punished for his murder!" Prestes was red in the face, out of breath but still absolutely determined. Amazonas moved to slamming the gavel on the wall, and waved for his men to settle down. The Party was seconds from an outright brawl between the two factions, and he had only seconds to bring everyone back together. This would take tact.\n\n"Shut your mouth Prestes, your mad dog attacked Miguel! It was self defense, and that's the end of it!" The room turned quiet immediately, as everyone of Prestes' men grouped up around their leader, as though acting on a well rehearsed script. Prestes cleared his throat, and Amazonas saw tears in his eyes. "We knew this day was coming, João. What the hell happened to you? Every day you get more violent, more authoritarian. What happened to our plans, now all you talk about is your bloody agrarian revolution! This is the last straw. When would you have had one of your goons kill me, in 'self defense'? This Party is no longer about the Communist Brazil we are trying to build, it's about you."\n\nWith that, Prestes' men filed out the door. The remaining members stood confused, deprived of both a fight and half the party's strength. Amazonas collapsed against the back wall, and held his head in his hands. How could he lead the Revolution if his own party was splitting around him?"

 brazil.27.desc: "Plinio Salgado sat and stared blankly at the cityscape just outside his drab office window. Lisbon was no Brasília, that's for sure. Ever since his, ah, failure in 1955, Salgado had been forced into exile in the Iberian city of Lisbon, and he was just about sick of it. Siestas, christ. Salgado was sick of goddamn Iberians, sick of their idiotic customs and sick of watching his own party get subverted from a million miles away, completely helpless to do anything about it.\n\nDeep breath. Salgado was working himself into a frenzy just thinking about that idiot Lott driving his country into the ground. He needed to go for a walk, smoke a cigarette, something. Anything to get away from the depressing reports his few loyal agents in Brazil still sent him. Salgado pried himself from his seat and left his shitty rented office, in a shitty building packed full of the things. When he fled to Iberia, his hope was to bring Franco or Salazar onto his side, to gather their support and retake Brazil in the name of Fascism. Unfortunately, that notion was dispelled soon enough. Franco barely humoured his requests and meetings, while Salazar categorically refused to speak to him. Eventually, even Franco shunned him, apparently annoyed with the requests of a fellow Fascist patriot and believer. Idiots.\n\nSalgado made his way over to a small park near the building, a charming little slice of the outdoors with a pond. Like it or not, he had no route back into Brazil, no hope of taking back his country. Unless something changed, either here or back home, Salgados cause was doomed."
 brazil.27.a: "He brought some bread for the ducks."

 brazil.28.t: "The Ship is Leaking"
 brazil.28.desc: ""Here are the facts, Henrique. The armed forces are... annoyed, with recent decisions that have been made. Your administration has repeatedly fumbled and mismanaged issues of national security. Congress has also failed and the politicians in Brasília bicker as the country is left defenseless. Some more radical officials have even advocated for, well, your resignation. By force, if necessary."\n\nLott was fuming. Under any other circumstances, he would have had the smirking officer Sylvio Frota sitting across from him expelled from service, arrested and tried. Unfortunately, he no longer had that luxury of the upper hand, this was a informal meeting between the ex president and a influential officer. The impertinent bastard leaned in closer. "Unless things change, immediately, we will be forced to take action."\n\nLott, through gritted teeth, replied. "I can promise that conditions for the military will improve, and the government will not take any actions that may compromise your opinions of us. In return, your blatant power grabs will cease."\n\n"Ah, Mr. President, that sounds like a wonderful arrangement. Let's hope it goes as smoothly as both of us hope. Though as we both know your presence in Brasília is not as... influential as it once was. Talk to you later, Lott." Sylvio Frota smugly said\n\nThe moment the bastard was out the door, Lott collapsed into his chair. It was moments like these where he really felt his age, really felt the press of steering the ragged ship that was Brazil. Things had been simpler in the Army. Well, he chuckled, maybe not that much simpler. He cracked open the bottom drawer of his desk and pulled out a fine bottle of whiskey, a single bottle of which cost into the thousands. He had been saving it for a special occasion, but special occasions were in short supply nowadays."
 brazil.28.a: "He took a sip, but didn't taste it."

 brazil.29.t: "The Death of Democracy"
 brazil.29.desc: "The Senado chamber was the perfect reflection of Brazil's political chaos; Men and women from every corner of the political spectrum were engaged in intense but worthless arguments, screaming insults at those they would have considered friends mere weeks ago. Even the parties were irrevocably split into dozens of tiny factions, throwing out all notions of unity over the slightest political or even personal disagreement. From the highest offices to the smallest town assemblies, Brazil was in complete and utter disarray.\n\nThe Senado chamber was a perfect mirror of the failures of Brazilian democracy, so it was only fitting that it be host to its death as well. Auro de Mora Andrade, lounging casually in a peaceful corner away from the room's anarchy, smashed a gavel against the wall. The sudden bang was followed by three more, as a team of soldiers burst through the doors and fired twice into the ceiling. The chaos ceased in a heartbeat, as Sylvio Frote strode inside. He relished in the sudden silence. This was order, enforced by the only thing that mattered.\n\n"Gentlemen and women alike! The hellish anarchy consuming Brazil has weighed heavy on the armed forces minds these past days, as I am certain it has weighed on yours. We have decided on a new course of action, one that will repair and restore the beauty of this fine nation to its former glory! The civilian government of Brazil will be dissolved, and replaced with a military-led provisional authority that will guide all Brazilians back to stability. Worry not, the fine patriots behind me will ensure you are escorted safely back to your homes. Enjoy your vacation, my friends! It may be a while."\n\nIt was a scene mirrored thousands of times over across the country. Military forces swept government buildings, expelling or arresting public, democratically elected officials. In some cases, policemen rallied around defiant civil servants and barricaded themselves in government buildings, demanding explanations for the disgusting mutinies. These vestiges were put down, with prejudice. Gunshots and screams echoed across Brazil as yet another young democracy was bathed in blood."

 brazil.30.desc: "Lott coughed twice before speaking, "Let's get this out of the way immediately. I intend to join the OFN defense of South Africa against the Schild. To do any less is to allow fascists to continue their campaign of murder unchecked." Lott sat down at the head of the long meeting table, looking at the assembly of generals before him. At the other end sat Odylio Denys, War Minister. To his right, sat... Quadros. This meeting would decide, once and for all, the Brazilian response to the South African War.\n\nDenys piped up first. "I think I speak for the entire military high command when I say that we agree, Mr. President. We are already preparing an offensive against the Schild, so I recommend we get right into the planning. If there's no objections?" Everyone around the table gave varying grunts of affirmation, nods and even the odd 'yep'. All except one.\n\n"Do you want the Germans to shoot our heads off our necks!? There's already a goddamned continent full of Nazis, why antagonize them!? Whenever Barry or whatever whoreson wins their civil war, they're going to nuke us into paste! I object!" Quadros had fully stood up now, and banged his fist on the table at the end for good effect. He slammed his hands down again, and sat back in his seat, red-faced and puffing.\n\nAn awkward silence filled the room, until Lott tentatively broke it. "Uh, well. Thank you, Jânio. If there's nothing else... Let's get into the planning.""

 brazil.31.desc: "Annoyed officials filtered out of the National Congress building, still bickering amongst themselves over the recent debate on intervening in the SAW. Most PSD and USD members were dead-set on intervention, but almost all of the PTB were fiercely opposed to war of any kind, sticking steadfast to their isolationist policies. At the moment, the independents and smaller parties were mostly neutral. President Lott aimed to change that. Party whips were running themselves ragged, dashing to and fro between the offices of every official who so much as looked at the fence. Nothing besides out-and-out blackmail was off limits, so assurances, amendments and quite a few bribes were being lavished on the typically ignored minor parties, who were relishing the sudden attention\n\nPro-war politicians already had the majority, but the more officials Lott brought onto his side the better. He had no intention of dealing with squabbling bureaucrats while he ran a campaign. Luckily, most had been receptive to the idea. Brazil's armed forces hadn't properly stretched their legs since the embarrassment of WWII. It was time to demonstrate why they were still the masters of South America."

Not too long ago, a coalition of fascists attacked the Union of South Africa, the last beacon of democracy in the continent. Now our boys are getting ready to ship out and help the war effort, fighting alongside the Union to protect democracy. Problem is, an awful lot of you think this is a bad idea. An awful lot of you would rather let the fascists win, let them keep up their mass murder  and oppression of our brothers and sisters across the sea. So, I've got a little story to share with you."\n\n"A fair while ago now, a cruel monster took control of one of the world's oldest countries. This country had been chipped away at for a long time, turned small and helpless by the passing of time and foreign wars. When this monster took control, the people loved him. He was vicious, a murderous drug addict that lived off of cruelty and hatred, but he promised a return to better times. This monster slowly grew its power, grew its armies, but the nations around him did nothing. Were they afraid? No. The monster could have been stopped at any time, but no-one would take the time to put an end to him. They were too apathetic, too sure of their own victories and glory."\n\n"Finally, the monster and his armies attacked one of the nations surrounding them. The nation cried out for help, help against the cruel hordes that ransacked its natural beauty and free society, but they were ignored. The monster destroyed this country, and brought its ruined lands into his own hateful society. With these new lands and industry, the monster turned its attention to gathering an even larger army, until eventually it eclipsed even its old, powerful neighbors. From there, it took hardly any effort at all to destroy everything in sight. It turned on its old allies, and the monster lived off of death and cruelty for a long, long time.""

This, however, was no ordinary letter from a petitioner, a curious high school student, or, for that matter, a sycophantic good-for-nothing of a minor politician. He tended to take such letters, give a form-letter reply, sign them, and throw them into the nearest wastebasket.\n\nWhat was so different about this letter? It was a letter from Carlos Lacerda, a fanatical opponent of the current government and a fellow grandee of Lacerda's UDN.\n\n"My dear Jânio,\n\nI have heard of some important information that is of great urgency and potential benefit the Republic of Brazil. Accordingly, I'd be deeply grateful if you could pay me a visit at my office in the next few weeks..."\n\nJânio had no difficulty guessing at what the Crow wanted to talk about.

"Carlos here thought I'd be of use in this little discussion of ours."\n\nQuadros concluded that that made sense, though he was still displeased. "Speaking of, where is the Crow this fine day?" At that moment Lacerda came in from behind, surprising Quadros. "The Crow's here. Good to see you, Jânio."\n\nQuadros, shaking off his initial shock, nodded. "Yes, the same for both of you. As you can probably guess, I'm in. So what's the plan?"\n\nLacerda and Adhemar smirked and leaned forward. Lacerda began to speak. "You know that weird project of Lott's? That highway? Let's take all the dirt we have about the embezzlement and fraud that's happening on the Highway and the fact that Lott hasn't done a single thing about it. We can set off a few hundred protests and riots, watch Lott's government collapse under the chaos, and put someone distinctly better than him up in his place."\n\nQuadros nodded approvingly.

As this project has proceeded, officials and workers have been ridden down by bribery, extortion, and corruption at every turn. Worse yet, our President, Henrique Lott, far from addressing these as his station demands, seems to have decided that fighting corruption is not a priority for him. You all know that I cannot agree with that kind of mindset under any circumstances.\n\nAs I believe that our government must focus on the total elimination of corruption in its functioning, I have made the following two demands to the President.\n1) A full investigation into the corruption that has taken place.\n2) The total and immediate rectification of any abnormalities in the Project.\n\nIf the President fails to comply with these demands, which are reasonable by any standards, I will have no choice but to resign in order to serve the country through other means than as vice-president to a man who will neither fight corruption nor allow others any input in governance."\n\nQuadros, looking at the final document, nodded approvingly, and grabbed a copy of a resignation letter he had drafted.

"He's planning to move forward with his resignation because the working relationship between him and Lott has deteriorated beyond recovery.\n\nThe first reporter laughed.

He had already had a meeting with many of the major members of the PSD, who in polite terms had refused to back him in case a impeachment attempt was launched. For the first time in Lotts life he felt he had been outplayed, and to him there was only one thing he could do that would keep his honour intact.\n\n"People of Brazil!\n\nDue to the recent crisis about corruption in the Trans-Amazonian Highway project caused by corrupt bureaucrats and oligarchs, and in order to protect the integrity of the democratic process, I am tendering my immediate resignation as President of the Brazilian Republic. It is my earnest hope that the Brazilian people will be able to find a new leader able to succeed where I failed and bring Brazil to a new era of prosperity."\n\nOf course Lott knew this was a plot by that crazed drunkard Quadros. If he had tried harder to reach a permanent modus vivendi with his former vice-president, this might not have happened. But it was too late now.

Frota wiped the sweat away. The room was stuffy.\n\nEventually the tide of anger receded, leaving the general alone in a sea of contempt. "Members of the legislature. The republic has stood without leadership for weeks, now. The nation is adrift, rudderless. Those who should have captained it squabble like children." A tide of jeers. Former president Kubitschek stood up, asked by what rights the soldiers had come. The general turned aside his gaze from the socialist snake, back to the rest of the assembly. "The men of the national army have always stood as guardians, as defenders of the Brazilian nation. We cherish its democracy. Yet we will not let it be used by greedy and ambitious men while the republic crumbles. The legislature failed to confirm Mr. Goulart as the next president in the order of succession. It is its prerogative. However, no progress has been made on nominating a new leader for the country. The brave soldiers of the national army implore the assembly to solve this current crisis within three months."\n\nMore shouting. Sweat threatening to run into his eyes. The general blinked away the irritant. "Were the honorable members of the legislature to fail in finding a president within those hundred days, the consequences would be most unfortunate for our nation. The people's mandate will be respected. Yet the people have not elected for their representatives to make a mockery of the nation on the world's stage. Gentlemen, we expect a solution within a hundred days. Brazil must be shepherded through these dangerous times."\n\nA final rain of jeers. The general walked away, unconcerned. These clowns would do as instructed, or there would be hell to pay."

It was early in the morning with the sun only having risen and outside the sky was covered with clouds. Lott took a sip of the coffee he had been given by his secretary as he waited for the two to reply.\n\nEffectively that is the case Tancredo Neves stated before speaking again. "I have gathered a few economic proposals that will help us deal with this problem. Raise some taxes here and there, change the interest rates, make it harder for companies to dodge their taxes. That should settle the crisis." Celso Furtado nodded and replied,  "And with these proposals, we can ensure economic growth continues to soar and our industrialization program is not hampered."\n\nLott nodded before smiling, "Well I am glad that this crisis looks like it will be easily dealt with, finally some good ne...."\n\n"Lott, they bloody shot him." Quadros shouted as he barged into the meeting room. "Shot who Jânio." Lott quickly replied, he was used to Quadros's outbursts by now, but someone had been shot and he could not easily dismiss this comment.\n\n"João Pedro Teixeira, leader of the Peasent Leagues in Paraíba. He was walking home with his children. Then someone pulled out a gun and bloody shot him three times in the back. He was dead within the hour. The Peasant leagues are furious talks about strikes are flying about."\n\nLott, Tancredo and Celso who were all looking at Quadros when he barged in were all quiet for a few moments.

Hundreds of supporters - many of them treated with a dose of the hyper-effective drug Payola HCl administered through various types of envelope - applauded wildly for him. Adhemar marched past them as the crowd applauded and the cameras rolled - it was his moment, and by God and the Saints he would savour it.\n\nAdhemar de Barros, by the grace of God and the favor of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida, President of Brazil, entered the Senado chamber.

One of the generals sitting next to Marshall Castelo Branco apparently scoffed at the President's words, but the Marshall's quiet stare reprimanded him.\n\nThe President called for unity between the government and the Armed Forces, his words chosen with the utmost care so as not to upset the audience. Jango's sole purpose here was neutralizing the threat of the military as diplomatically as possible. He profusely declared his respect for the military and hoped for their cooperation with the government. Jango finished his speech, and eyed Castelo Branco, hoping for a positive, if non-commital, answer.\n\nThe Marshall stood quiet, staring at Jango with cold eyes, and for a full minute, no one spoke.\n\n"Thank you for your words, your Excellency." Marshall Humberto Castelo Branco broke the awkward silence. "We from the Armed Forces have sworn to defend our country from whatever threat emerges. And this duty we shall fulfill.""
 brazil.51.a: "The Armed Forces stand vigilant."

 brazil.52.t: "Return of the Golden Years"
 brazil.52.desc: ""...and so, what this Presidency will promise is a return to the policies and the time of the past. A period of economic growth, and renewed optimism and pride within our nation. We will build on the successes of my previous term and the intermediate one to replicate what we have done before. And that is an economic boom like we have previously experienced."\n\nThe São Paulo crowd burst into cheers with this vow. Kubitschek had missed this, with hundreds of signs with his name and Brazilian flags being waved by the listeners. And he could only imagine how the rest of his country would receive such words of optimism.\n\n"I promised you one before fifty years of progress in five, and my administration delivered. Now, I promise you another period of rapid progress and opportunity that each Brazilian shall feel. And I am still steadfast in my belief that Brazil is, and shall remain, the country of the future. We are unique amongst South American countries, and we will continue to keep our modernity."\n\nThe crowd loved it. Nationalism, optimism, a promise of better times, all of that was going to impress any group of people. And the best part was he didn't need to lie about it as politicians often did. They knew what his first term had done, and they knew they wanted more. And when JK said he would do it again, who would doubt or disbelieve him?\n\nNot in the São Paulo square. But in the room in Rio where the editorial board of Tribuna da Imprensa met, the speech was much less warmly received. They listened in silence to the radio as Kubitschek made his grand promises and glossed over the less warm parts of his presidency. Finally, Carlos Lacerda said what everyone else was thinking."
 brazil.52.a: ""Who does he think he's fooling?""

 brazil.53.t: "Meeting With Denys"
 brazil.53.desc: ""Your Excellency, you know what I think of Brizola." Minister of Defense Odylio Denys said, facing President Goulart in his office. "Generally, I do not agree with his foolish ideals and his radicalism, and I voiced my complaints to yourself more than once already. And, more than once, you chose to listen to him. No government should ever ignore and antagonize the Armed Forces, and now I hear Brizola has plans to move directly against them?"\n\nJango put out his cigarette, pondering on every word coming out of Denys' mouth. The minister's reasoning was sound. Brizola had drawn his plans for weakening the military's political strength and their grasp over the country. Of course, this would be presented as "enforcing the civilian government's supremacy over the army" or some other white lie. Jango was weary though. If even supporters like Denys saw Brizola's approach as too radical, how would Castelo Branco and hardliners like Costa e Silva react?\n\n"Minister, what do you recommend?" Jango asked, in a tired voice.\n\n"We go to Castelo Branco and offer an olive branch. Maybe offer a cabinet position to one of his allies." Denys answered at once. "The government must win back their support.""
 brazil.53.a: ""I am sorry, Denys. Brizola knows what he is doing.""
 brazil.53.b: ""You are right, Denys. We cannot attack the Army.""

 brazil.54.t: "An Uncomfortable Visit"
 brazil.54.desc: ""Mr. President, what can you say about your and your party's ties to brutal former dictator Getúlio Vargas?"\n\n"Mr. President, many have claimed that your government is opposed to American interests. In that light, what does this visit to Washington mean?"\n\n"Mr. President, what about the allegations that your cabinet has ties with illegal communist groups?"\n\nJoão Goulart was used to dealing with hostile press back home, but this barrage of inconvenient questions from the American reporters was a surprise to his entourage. The visit to Washington was supposed to improve the President's image abroad and, if possible, gather international support and beneficial trade deals for the country. No amount of preparation could have helped Jango for this reception. One of the reporters even dared to ask about the President's mistresses, though all present agreed that the question did not warrant an answer, disrespectful as it was.\n\nAfter shaking off the seemingly unending questions and the incessant flashes of the cameras, a single thought troubled Jango. Some leftists insisted this was a kowtow to Washington, and Goulart was starting to understand their point. If the media was so bold and so antagonistic, how would the American government react to his visit? He decided to cast off these doubts and move forward."
 brazil.54.a: "He was here to help the Brazilian people, after all."

 brazil.55.t: "The Master Plan"
 brazil.55.desc: ""I came here as soon as you called," Neves said as he hung his hat and coat on the wall. "What did you want to talk about, this dinner proposal?"\n\n"I have this guest list for the next few weeks," Kubitschek said as he handed over a list of names. "I'm going to hold some meetings with these people to calm down the military and make it so we might actually have an election at the end of this. Look it over and tell me if it's good."\n\nNeves took the paper. "Well, maybe some fundraising sessions and meeting with some of the high ranking...hold on, that isn't...isn't Alberto Fernandez from-"\n\n"Exactly," said Kubitschek as he smiled. "We get diplomatic support from the South American governments, and that calms the military down about us. Just meet their ambassadors, go on foreign tours, and generate positive headlines for us that the military will see and calm down."\n\n"Might also help us with the electorate too," Neves thought aloud. "They love the statesman angle. Yes, I can see why you like this idea. We should call Walter Salles and get him working on setting these visits up."\n\n"Salles! Right, excellent suggestion. Let's do it. And don't worry, I never dreamed of contacting Paraguay and bringing them into this."\n\nNeves smiled. "It's perfect then.""

The recent airport occupation is the clearest sign of this fact. But I think that Marshal Lott has the right of it. I will leave them alone for now and try my level best not to rock the boat."\n\nThus João Goulart spoke when asked by his officials for an instruction regarding the matter of particularly rebellious officers in the armed forces. When two people heard of this decision, they came to Goulart's office in the Palácio do Planalto at the same time to make their opinions known.\n\nOne of them, Leonel Brizola, disapproved quite strongly. "Damn it all, Jango, you should have taken those good-for-nothing would-be Napoleons head-on and dealt with them once and for all. Now their threat will hang over us for the rest of your time in office!"\n\nThe other, Odylio Denys, was more sympathetic. "I really do think that the governor ought to cut you some slack. On the one hand, granted, they will remain a threat. I and the constitutionalists are here to help you out with that. But on the other hand, if you had gone along with Senhor Brizola's plan, you'd have done nothing but antagonize them, and possibly caused the very coup you wanted to avoid."\n\nGoulart listened to them both and nodded. He found Denys' views more convincing, all things considered."

When two people heard of this decision, they came to Goulart's office in the Palácio do Planalto at the same time to make their opinions known.\n\nOne of them, Odylio Denys, disapproved quite strongly. "All due respect, Senhor Presidente, but you've blundered by going along with Brizola's plan. You've done nothing but antagonize them, and possibly caused the very coup you wanted to avoid; I'm honestly not so sure that Lott and I will be able to hold this back."\n\nThe other, Leonel Brizola, was more sympathetic. "Rubbish! It had to be done; you did the right thing to get rid of as many of these traitors as possible!"\n\nGoulart listened to them both and nodded. He found Brizola's mindset more convincing, but Denys' words left a sliver of doubt in his mind, which widened when news of sharply reduced military loyalty began to filter in."

 brazil.58.t: "Welcome to the Jungle"
 brazil.58.desc: "A crowd of South African men and women burst into cheers as the first Brazilian marines disembarked from their ships, heralding the entry of South America's greatest power into the war for liberty. Heitor marched in the middle of his column, grinning and putting his head down as the Brazilians weathered a storm of back slaps and thrown flowers. Eventually they pushed through the crowd, and made their way to a temporary barracks just outside of Cape Town.\n\nAfter a long and bumpy truck ride they arrived and began to unload their gear. Once their things were stowed, the weary Brazilians were set loose in a larger communal lot, packed full of other marines and foreign volunteers. Tomorrow would be full of debriefings, gear checks and the typical bureaucracy involved in mobilization, but for now there was nothing to do but fraternize till dinner. Heitor sat on a loose crate, and wiped his brow. He was warned about the heat, but the real thing was even worse than he imagined.\n\nHeitor lifted his head as he heard the tromp of boots on gravel growing nearer, barely dodging an outthrust, viciously sunburnt hand. A young man stood straight as a rail in front of him. "Um, uh, howdy there sir. I'm, um, the names Private Smith, US Army. Just, I just wanted to introduce myself. Sir."

It was Sunday, the day of rest- and it showed as he drove past buses full of old ladies heading to church. Today, he had a different goal: The sea. His girlfriend, Maria, sitting on the passenger seat, grinned with excitement every time he hit the throttle, and the V8 rumbled louder than the song playing on the radio.\n\nHe never thought a young man like him would have a car like this. That joy was for playboys from Ipanema, not for the son of a single mother like him. If there was something he'd learned recently, though, miracles happen; such as an accounting job at the governor's office, earned through a hard selection process and many nights without sleeping for the entrance exam.\n\nNow he reaped the rewards of his hard work by cruising fast. As the speedometer hit 99, Paulo drove through the tunnel- no traffic at all. He remembered reading on the news about how there used to be a favela on that hill, and how Governor Lacerda demolished it to build the tunnel. Paulo didn't give much thought about it- after all, going from his home to Copacabana in less than an hour used to be the stuff of dreams.\n\nThe Opala parked right next to the white sands, and as Paulo pulled his surfboard off the roof, his thoughts turned to a more pressing matter: seeing the sun reflecting off Maria's golden hair."

 brazil.60.desc: "Kubitschek could understand that not every building of governance was as modern nor as contemporary in its style as the ones in Brasília, but to be in one so obviously out of the present times put him slightly out of his element.\n\nThe headquarters of the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Relations was built on the tail end of the Beaux Arts movement, when Kubitschek was a small boy. The decorations of the inside recalled a more hopeful time, where humanity believed that science could usher in an age of understanding and plenty, not condemn the human race to face a spectre of annihilation. There were few buildings like this in South America. And heaven knew how many of the ones in Paris it was based on still survived the SS jackboot.\n\nThe snapping of a flashbulb snapped him out of him pondering how things must be in a building built before air conditioning. "...and would these trade agreements be applicable in the future?" he heard the Argentine minister ask.\n\n"We have had a wonderful relationship with Argentina during my Presidency, Minister," he said. "And I assure you building bonds with our South American neighbors will continue to be a priority. We will continue to develop our relationship, and yes, this does include new trade agreements between Brazil and Argentina."\n\n"President Kubitschek," said one of the diplomats, "you do understand any official support of your candidacy would constitute an improper interference in the internal affairs of your country by foreign diplomats?"\n\n"Precisely, and I expect you know that too." Kubitschek took a sip of water. "So I know it would be off the record.""

 brazil.62.desc: "Many could describe Brasília as "Kubitschek's city," but those who really knew the capitol would know the home near the outskirts of the city really was his place. Many diplomats knew this, it was expected of them. And several of the South American ones were there even for an important dinner. Wines from the Vale dos Vinhedos were taken from the cellar, and a wonderful spread of feijoada was prepared.\n\nAt four PM, they started to arrive at the home, greeted by Sarah Kubitschek. The master of the house unfortunately had to arrive in the middle of the group, being delayed by weather from a timely return from a campaign stop earlier in the day in Montes Claros.  None of the Ambassadors from Brazil's neighbors seemed to take offense at the slight, as everyone there knew very well the trouble of traveling by air.\n\nThe conversation before, during, and after the dinner focused mainly on the upcoming election and the possible second presidency of JK. Everyone had their unique concerns and areas of interest. Guyana wanted to know Kubitschek's feelings towards the OFN. Argentina had concerns about water rights in the Alto Paraná basin. Venezuela enquired about a possible land route to the nation in the future. All those questions were elegantly handled or skillfully ignored by the once and future president.\n\nFinally, after the food was eaten, the wine was drunk, and the moon held high in the sky, the ambassadors began to leave back to the bright lights of the main city. And Kubitschek watched them go, content in his belief he had charmed a few of them into supporting his candidacy."

Since in the aftermath of his drubbing in the Hundred Days' Crisis the man had nothing better to do with his life, he sat there screeching incessantly about the current "quasi-communistic fascist" regime ruling in Brazil. But for all that he ruthlessly condemned the PTB government, he seemed to conveniently forget all the things that he had messed up. Fortunately, however, Goulart and his press surrogates remembered it all quite well.\n\nGoulart directed his press officers to begin attacking Lacerda ruthlessly on any weak points they could think of. Instances such as his follies in the governorship of Guanabara, his ruthless cruelty towards the homeless, and the forcible clearing and displacement of favelas flooded the papers. This seemed to have a fairly good effect... until Lacerda began to retaliate with his own advertisements attacking Goulart's "slavish adherence to Getulist fascism" among other such slanderous nonsense.\n\nIn the end, all that came of the plan was just another mud-slinging contest, with pro- and anti-Goulart ads joining each other in near-total irrelevance in the popular consciousness within mere weeks. No real change was noticed in public attitudes other than the confirmation of the various biases held by both Goulart and Lacerda's partisans, and the positive effect of either campaign was debatable at best."

In his brief time in power, he had fought the energy crisis, expanded the franchise, raised the minimum wage, reconciled with the PSD, and taken the fight to Adhemar and Lacerda in the aftermath of the crisis the two of them had set off. Despite all the progress, however, Goulart still felt a terrible sense of doubt and worry, and it was beginning to show in his private conversations with his confidant, Governor Leonel Brizola.\n\n"My God, I don't know what to do, brother, I'm so worried. If I make a single misstep, it'll be curtains for me, and the next thing I know Lacerda or Adhemar will sink their damned claws into the presidency. I don't know what to do, I don't know what to-"\n\nAt this point, Brizola put a hand on Jango's shoulder in an effort to calm him down. "Come now, Jango, this won't do. You need to remain calm and think about the two main strategies you and the rest of them came up with. Either you pledge to continue the reforms in your next term, which will irritate the military and lose us some of the rural north while gaining us backing in the south." At this point Brizola smirked slightly. "Or you can take a more moderate stance, which won't hurt your chances but will definitely keep the military nice and quiet."\n\nGoulart had calmed down. "Yes, thank you, Leonel. That helped a lot. It's time for me to make my decision, then.""

Some may have considered it akin  to the National Mall in the District of Columbia, but the locals considered it the largest roadway in the world, with over a hundred possible lanes in the avenue. In a sense, they were right, but there was a massive green space in the middle, limiting traffic to six lanes on the other side. But this did not impede the vehicle as it traveled through the modernist government buildings of the Esplanada dos Ministérios.\n\nParking at the Praça dos Três Poderes, the driver opened the passenger door and out stepped Juscelino Kubitschek. Taking a short stroll on the white stone plaza, he briefly looked at the buildings of governance around him. The Congresso Nacional, the Palácio da Justiça, but what really caught his attention was the flag of Brazil and the Palácio do Planalto. He stood there for a minute, reflecting, before he hopped back into the car for a final stop.\n\nIt was no difficult task to get there, as despite its length, the route was a mere left merge. Eventually the Via Palácio Presidencial brought him through the vast stretch of wilderness to another plaza of white stone. And from there, the last light of the day lit the Palácio da Alvorada beautifully, its western rays reflecting off the white of its construction so far in the distance.\n\nIt was his again, he was certain, his home. The one he built, and the one he would have once again. His election was assured, his reascension certain, and the second term the Brazilian people wanted would occur. This day may have been ending, but sure enough a new dawn would be in the east, one that would illuminate the modern buildings and hardworking construction sites once again.\n\nWas this counting chickens before they hatched? Perhaps. But, he knew, an optimist could make mistakes."

As he waited for the report he began to stew in frustration. For over a decade the Germans had continued to humiliate Brazil, constantly crossing over Brazilian waters and fishing, undermining his country's sovereignty. The Germans had only been getting more and more aggressive with their fishing, and their constant bombing campaigns over West Africa, driving more and more men to piracy to live. Toscano sighed as he thought about this, when suddenly a report came in.\n\n"Sir, all ships are reporting on schedule. Twelve pirate vessels have been destroyed utterly, three have been captured and seven have fled Brazilian waters. All of this with zero casualties." The young comms officer spoke in a grinding monotone, giving every report with a serious expression of grim certainty.\n\n"Understood, tell the ships to rejoin the task force." Toscano quickly replied and for the first time that week Toscano allowed a smile to emerge on his face. Since Lott gave him an expanded task force he was able to effectively deal with incursions against both pirates and German fishing vessels. Toscano truly believed that finally the Lobster war would be put to an end."

A Brazilian fighter was strafing one of their sister ships, an even smaller dinghy a ways off their port side. Even a boat like that paid for itself a hundred times over out here, raking in thousands of Reichsmarks per week in precious and unguarded lobster. Well, practically unguarded. As he watched the vessel get riddled with bullets, Kwame realized that the rumours of Brazil taking action weren't as unfounded as he thought.\n\n"Just cut them, we don't have time! Get the engine running, we need to go now!" Kwame hurried up to the helm and turned a complete 180 away from the fighter, hoping against hope that it was too distracted with the other ships in his little flotilla to chase after him in particular. He might need to seek out a new profession after this. Well, assuming he survived.\n\nAs they sped off, the fighter finally sank the remains of its first target. The pilot checked around for new targets, as every ship in the flock he had ambushed began to scatter like frightened pigeons. His eyes passed over other small dinghies, a few decently sized trawlers, hell, there was even a freighter or two. One of the freighters in particular caught his eye, a big bastard that had broken off from the pirate fleet before any of the others.\n\nBut as he prepared to sink Kwame and his crew beneath the sea, along with their illegal cargo, he noticed something else. A small vessel in amongst the swarm, but significantly more modern than any of the others. As he focused in, he saw why. Ha. He had a new target."

Liberia's Foreign Minister reciprocated the handshake warmly, and soon Salles was back on his way to Brazil. The constant flights to and from the edge of Africa were tiring, to say the least, but the collaboration of Africa's governments in piracy prevention was near priceless.\n\nWith every nation allied to the cause, fewer pirates were spotted in Brazilian waters. Salles suspected, quietly, that this was because many of the poorer countries actually sent some of those pirates, but it hardly mattered. Better to stop them at the source then chase pirate dinghies all over the ocean."

It was, uh, mildly childish, but Salles always found it helped him to think. Usually. It sure as hell wasn't doing anything for him now. There was no Free French Embassy, they didn't have a goddamn phone number, sending a letter was completely out of the question. To fly there he would need the bombing schedules, something only the French themselves would have. There was nothing for it.

This "country" was a place of extreme contradiction. As he had flown overhead, on a carefully planned route that circumvented the omnipresent German bombers, he saw the extreme devastation wreaked on these ravaged people. Craters covered the land. Nearly every building was patched over and wore the signs of constant reconstruction, and there were more than a few bodies blasted apart. As he understood it, the French would begin clean-up at night, when the bombers took a brief break from their massacre.  Free France was on the outskirts of the worst of the German bombing campaigns, but that only lessened the terror. It sure as hell didn't prevent it.\n\nBut as Salles stepped from the plane onto one of two functioning airstrips in Free France, he saw something entirely different. Regiments of well dressed soldiers filled the perfectly maintained concrete field in front of him. Tanks formed a line behind them, and even further back loomed a battery of anti-aircraft guns. There were no craters here. The last remnants of the proud French army were well protected, ostensibly in preparation to reclaim their long last homeland. It seems the rumours of de Gaulles singular focus were true. Speaking of...\n\n"Welcome to France!"

So, what will it take to get you involved in the piracy crisis we are facing?" De Gaulle immediately sobered up and put his hands on the table, fixing Salles with a suddenly serious gaze. Salles leaned back, slightly. Maybe this old man was more than he appeared to be. De Gaulle reached into a drawer under his gigantic desk, drawing forth a single sheet of paper. He slid it across to Salles, and gestured for him to read.\n\n"These are our demands. While France would dearly love to combat the brigands and, GERMANS that plague you, the fight to reclaim our home requires... equipment. We need guns, Mr. Salles, guns and tanks. A lot of them." Salles' eyes widened as he reviewed the long list de Gaulle had given him, asking for thousands of weapons in no uncertain terms. Accepting this deal would be a... significant investment. The French remnants could be a hell of a help in stopping the Lobster War at its source, but was it worth it?"
 brazil.77.a: ""I'm sure we can work something out, Mr. De Gaulle. You have a deal.""
 brazil.77.b: ""These requests are absolutely ridiculous. No deal, Mr. De Gaulle.""
 
 brazil.78.t: "A Trans-Atlantic Agreement"
 brazil.78.desc: "Salles looked back over the list of assorted weapons de Gaulle had given him, and grinned. His plane was making its way back home to Brazil now, and while he sure wouldn't miss that little scrap of Africa, he found himself thinking of the people fondly. Crazy bastards, all of them. Still, Salles couldn't help but wish for their success, as unlikely as it might be.\n\nThe shipping of the guns and tanks de Gaulle requested would have to be done under heavy guard. The sheer size of the shipment would no doubt draw attention, but Salles suspected that was part of the reason for it in the first place. With this deal, Free France was being recognized by one of the largest nations in the world. Here's hoping de Gaulle would capitalize on it."
 brazil.78.a: "The remnants of France were legitimate again, for a little while."
 
 brazil.79.t: "A Trans-Atlantic Disappointment"
 brazil.79.desc: "Salles wasn't looking forward to reporting his failure to Lott. Already, as his plane made its way back home, he was running through scenarios out how he was going to spin such an obvious waste of time. This diplomatic defeat rendered the months spent getting an audience with de Gaulle totally wasted, a time investment they didn't have the resources to recover from smoothly. Still, de Gaulle's demands were entirely unreasonable. Brazil would deal with the pirates on its own, as usual.\n\nCrazy bastards. For all the obvious impossibility of their goals, Salles couldn't help but admire them. To tell the truth, he dearly wished he could have given them their guns. Maybe, just maybe, they might have had a chance."
 brazil.79.a: "The remnants of France would forever remain unrecognized, at least by Brazil."

President Henrique Teixeira Lott was at work on a few pressing files, hoping to cash in on the interrupted work time to generate a free evening.\n\nLoud knocking on the door. No such luck.\n\n"Yes, Vice-President?" Lott asked without looking up.\n\n"Henrique, your order to the navy, it can be still countermanded. I've been looking for a few emissaries from the African sides and I think we can go for talks on cooperation on the issue. In particular the envoys from..."\n\n"No."\n\nQuadros' torrent of words was for once, completely dried up. The president looked at him. Shook his head. "There will be no countermanding, Jânio, for my decision to smash the pirates is final."\n\nPresident Lott knew his reputation. That he never changed his mind once it was set. It appeared his vice-president, blessedly, would listen to reason for once, and not waste another word on the topic. Quadros's bottom lip moved uselessly, stuck as he was mid word. Then, the vice-president closed his mouth. He stood there uselessly, wasting Lott's precious free time. Free time needed to actually run the country, instead of proposing hare-brained lusotropical schemes. "Will that be all, Jânio?"\n\n"Yes, Henrique." It was Lott's turn to be taken aback. The vice-president's fist shook impotently. The depth of Quadros' dismay and anger was apparent. The vice-president was a passionate man. Yet even then it was rare for him to betray so brazenly his anger at a political rival. Lott did not find it in himself to feel bad about sticking to his plan.\n\nIt took until a few minutes after the last of Quadros's steps echoed away for Lott's peace of mind to return."

Can we get a line through?"\n\n"Yes we'll get you a line to the President right now."\n\nThere was some static and a clicking, as the radio line was connected to Lott. "Hello? I was told Admiral Toscano wanted to speak to me."\n\n"Yes sir. He is right here."\n\nThere was some muffled shuffling coming from the ship line. Admiral Toscano came on the line and began to speak to Lott.\n\n"President Lott, we've come to the main area where the pirates have been operating. Me and some fellow tacticians have drawn up some plans and I would like to go over some of them with you before we take a course of action."\n\n"Well, what plans do you propose Admiral."\n\n"The first one is a complete non-stop search for the pirates. No breaks what so ever. The men won't like it, but several officers have recommended it. The pirates are a small group and we'll need to cover a lot of ground if we want to catch them."\n\n"The second plan is to involve the Airforce. To bring in some aircraft carriers and search planes. To spot them from the air and bring in the Navy. While this may make the whole operation more disorganized, it means an effective search while sparing the men from working long hours.\n\n"The third plan is the most simple one. Just do a regular search with regular hours. Continue to sweep as we normally would. Nothing too crazy or stressful, but it probably will be the least effective of the options. What are your orders to proceed, Sir?"\n\nLott grimaced. They would have to move quickly if they wanted to stop these raids on fishermen. But they didn't want a bungled operation. Thinking it over one last time, he gave his orders."

Their skin soaked in salt, they hadn't had a break in days, a temporary sleep and short meal being their only rest.\n\nStanding on the bridge of the flagship, Admiral Toscano continued to look out to sea with his binoculars. His eyes strained from staring at the sea for days. The ships hadn't seen a thing of the pirates. It's like the pirates had disappeared off the face of the Earth.\n\n"Sir!" said Toscano's first officer, "Some of the sailors are demanding an immediate meeting with you! They are threatening to stop working!"\n\n"Send them up!" He ordered.\n\nAdmiral Toscano sat down. He rubbed his strained eyes. He had been worrying something like this would happen. The non-stop schedule had been a very unpopular decision.\n\nThe Admiral looked up as two exhausted looking sailors walked into the room.\n\nThe sailors walked forward.\n\n"Sir. We have been working ourselves to death these past couple days. This schedule is killing us all."\n\n"I can't change the plans," said Toscano. "Those orders came right from the top. We were ordered to catch these pirates as quickly as possible. And this is, unfortunately, the way to do it."\n\nToscano rubbed his forehead. He didn't know what to do.\n\nA sailor who had been silently listening this whole time spoke up.\n\n"What about a pay raise? It will make this work actually worth something."\n\nToscano thought about it. It would be an effective solution to his problems. But there would be a mess of legal paperwork. And some of his superior's wouldn't be happy about it. He would have to radio Lott to help him sort it. He looked at the grungy sailors, silently standing as he thought over the option in his head."

The search for the pirates had to be halted immediately. Admiral Toscano was currently working around the clock to make sure the situation doesn't escalate into a full blown mutiny. Tensions have never been higher in the Navy, with some officers calling for the immediate court martial of the sailors. Some of the more extreme ones were even calling them to be shot for treason.\n\nWhat's worse yet was the media had caught onto the strike. No one knew how the leak had gotten out, but they had seized on the situation nonetheless. The papers were plastered with headlines like ANARCHY ON THE HIGH SEAS? And A MODERN DAY BOUNTY?. The Brazilian public was becoming increasingly restless with the state of the mission. Admiral Toscano's name was being dragged through the mud. This entire situation was cumulating into a mess for the Lott administration.\n\nThis pirate issue had been an utter mess for Lott. Decisive action was needed.\n\nDespite some protests from the party, Lott had decided to take full responsibility. He had sent several statements to the press, saying Admiral Toscano was completely free from any blame, that Lott had ordered the no break plan to be enacted, and the poor pay of the sailors would be rectified.\n\nLott had already signed several orders to pay the Navy crews. He hoped it would be enough to get them back to work, and had already sent a message to Admiral Toscano that he gave into the sailors demands and to immediately resume the nut for the pirates as soon as he possibly could.\n\nThe pirates were still out there, prowling the ocean for their next target. And the crews needed to get back to work as soon as possible."

Brazil's Lobster fisherman need to worry no longer about raids. The Brazilian government has destroyed the pirate scrounge, sending their ships to the bottom of the Ocean.\n\nAdmiral Toscano has been given a medal, and a well earned vacation for his part in the destruction of the lobster pirates. He seemed happy to do his duty, but weary from the long days at sea he had to spend.\n\nThis has of course been a huge score for Lott's government. The press has been raving about the excellent job they have done. Even some of Lott's enemies have admitted that he has done a good job in handling this situation. Lott has been very pleased at how the operation turned out.\n\nThe Fishermen were grateful as well, holding a huge rally in support of Lott for helping them. The ridding of the pirates has seen a boost to Lott's popularity nationwide. Brazilians have celebrated what they see as a great victory over those who would hurt Brazil.\n\nWhile the celebrations continue, the waters of the Ocean have gone still, as the storm passes over its ancient waters.\n\nPeace has finally returned to the South Atlantic."

He turned to the radio operator working next to him.\n\n"Any sign of the pirates?"\n\n"We haven't seen a trace of them Sir."\n\nThe Admiral sighed. The pirates had been elusive of the Navy task force ever since they left port. They hid in the vastness of the sea, using it's huge size to avoid the Navy. And every day that passed was another day the fishermen were stuck at land.\n\nHe sat back and rubbed his eyes, strained from the constant staring off into the waves.\n\nAnother problem for him to deal with was the sailors. The constant search with no end in sight was demoralizing, a general feeling of failure was starting to set in. Toscano had been trying to lift the spirits of the men, but the Admiral knew this could only work for so long. Eventually they would become too exhausted to continue on. They couldn't continue like this much longer.\n\nSome reconsidering of the plan was needed.  They couldn't work the men with no breaks. Maybe they could call in the air force. They would probably have to compensate them in some way, but their help would greatly increase their chances of finding the pirates.\n\nThe Admiral stopped rubbing his eyes and looked up again. He still saw an endless ocean without any interruptions in the water. And he still didn't see any signs of the pirates. As the radio operator continued to monitor the conditions of the other ships, the Admiral stood up as he came to a decision."

The fuel our pilots to burn up has punched a big hole in our finances, so we'll need the money."\n\n"And would the effects of this prospective budget manifest immediately in you having more fuel?"\n\n"Well, no, Mr President, but we'd need the money for repairs. We've got to keep these planes operational."\n\nLott winced. Repairs? If their planes needed repairs from small arms fire, they were wasting their money. Three options presented themselves immediately: accede to their demands, strongarm them or refuse entirely. The latter, to Lott, was the most urgently attractive. He cursed the beggars on the other end of the line, holding out for spare change while their bullet-ridden countrymen drowned in the brackish surf, but refusal would hardly save lives..."

The planes prepared to sweep the entire ocean in search.\n\nLott had to get through a mess of bureaucracy to even talk to the air force generals. He would need to rectify that. But that issue would have to be solved later.\n\nAnother problem that came up was the Generals wanted "compensation" for their help in the search. Lott had been forced to allow a bigger budget to the airforce. He wished he hadn't had to jump through all these hoops to get them to obey the President.\n\nBut now, even though some shady measures had to be taken to guarantee their support, the air force was involved, and the operation may hopefully move much quicker, even though it had cost a pretty penny.\n\nSo engines were revved and wheels scrapped against tarmac, as flight plans were drawn in offices. Fuel poured into tanks and bombs loaded into bomber bays. An ocean wide search was being prepared.\n\nThe Brazilian air force has been unleashed, and it will scour the skies until the last pirate ship is under the waves."

And as the news climbed up the rank ladder, the fleet turned it's direction and began to move towards the dot.\n\nAdmiral Toscano stood on the bridge looking into the distance with his binoculars. It was a cluster of ships.\n\n"It's them." He said breathlessly.\n\nHe turned on his ship's intercom "Battle stations! The pirate ships have been spotted!"\n\nHe turned to the crew on the bridge. "I want a pursuit at 15 knots. Radio all other ships to do the same. Prepare to fire when in range."\n\nHe rushed over to the radio operator. "I need you to get me a line to President Lott. Tell them it's urgent."\n\nHe looked down at the deck of the ship. People were scrambling to their positions, to the battery and the gunnery stations. A nervous energy had engulfed the crew. After weeks of searching, they had finally found them.\n\n"We have a line to the President, Sir!" Said the radio operator.\n\nToscano grabbed the line.  "Can you hear me Sir?"\n\n"Toscano?" said Lott from the other side of the line. "I can hear you. Is something wrong? It's early in the morning in Brasilia. And-" There were some murmurs in the background. "Jânio is here as well."\n\n"We have spotted the pirates and are moving in to intercept them, we are off the coast. I was wondering if we could follow in pursuit of them and wait for reinforcements.  Just in case there's too many pirates."\n\n"Well, that is fine by - What? Quadros wants to say something to give me a minute." There were some muffled noises from the other side."\n\nQuadros intejects, "You cannot wait, Admiral! What if the pirates escape? I must advise against this decision, we cannot let them slip through again."\n\nThere were some muffled noises from the other side of the phone. The two men seemed to be having an argument with each other. Moments passed, and finally Lott picked the line back up."

A Brazilian naval officer pointed his pistol at him and ordered some sailors to check him for weapons.\n\nAs the ships continued to sweep the area where the battle took place, a man on the bridge looked down and watched. They had pulled a lot of pirates out of the water, there were a lot of them, much more than was expected. It had taken a lot to rout the pirates. He sighed and looked back out to the sea. He watched as what remained of the Pirate's ships sunk further under the water. The waters of the Atlantic consuming the ships hull.\n\nHis fleet had taken a fair amount of damage too. They were headed immediately to the nearest port for repairs and medical evacuation.\n\nCasualties had been relatively low, but it was still too much for Toscano to be happy with, at least no one had died.

All that left was swirling debris and some floating bodies. The pirates had been completely annihilated. The fleet was now resting and preparing to go back to port.\n\nToscano finally smiled. After days of searching he had finally defeated the pirates. Quite easily as well. He turned to his first officer on the bridge. "Tell the other ships to prepare to move back to port.

Weeks of effort chasing down pirates had been handed to the Liberians to do instead. Soon fishermen could fish without fears of attacks and there would be no repeat of the Japanese kidnapping crisis.

Salles coughed before continuing, "I have a report from Toscano that supports this; pirate sightings have dropped dramatically.

 brazil.100.desc: "The air has grown unseasonably cold in Brazil of late. Even as tempers run hot in the national legislature, Brazilians huddle carefully around radios and televisions. Fear has returned to the country, a thousand overlapping gust of wind leaching hope for the future from all throughout the republic. The sudden cold snap, augur to a brewing storm, has obscured the future to all.\n\nIn Brasília the factions play their games. Chief among them is the PSD's Kubitschek. With the ascension of Goulart to the presidency as replacement for Quadros and Lott forestalled, former president Juscelino Kubitschek's supporters argue that only he has the capability to ascend to the presidency within the army's time limit. Popular within the liberal center and within elements of the left, Kubitschek is believed to possess the personal gravitas necessary to overcome the army's hatred for him.\n\nThe crisis has not only brought back the president from the political margins. The political right, weakened by its failures of the past decade, has surged back into the limelight. In these troubled times, after all, what better to assuage the fears of the army than a conservative government of the people? After the collapse of Quadros' political fortune, the austere Carlos Lacerda's resurgent control of the UDN is likely to help his ambition. Yet Lacerda is not the only schemer within the political right, as Adhemar de Barros' star continues to shine ever brighter. This unlikely couple has been forced into an uneasy coalition to check Kubitschek's advance.\n\nA thousand kilometer away, the unwitting instigator of the storm João Goulart sits in the Rio Grande do Sul, locked out of the capital's intrigue. Goulart remains a popular figure, free from the scandalous collapse of the late PSD-UDN coalition. Some within the country hope that Goulart can make it back to Brasília in time to break the deadlocked congress. Others in the nation scorn the idea of a king in the mountain coming to save them all. The winds blow cold in Brazil, and the coming storm is not likely to have a happy conclusion."

Two phones were precariously balanced on piles of papers on the edges of his desk. Unusual to see the usually disciplined Lacerda keep so untidy an office. These were unusual times. The same manic energy that had brought the UDN's grey eminence to feverishly awaiting phone calls had brought Adhemar to break precedent and seek to meet Lacerda personally, without the usual backchannels.\n\nLacerda slowly turned to look at the newcomer. A mixture of anger and curiosity danced behind his eyes. Perhaps the latter won out in the politician's heart as he tilted his head toward an empty chair.\n\n"Why are you here?" Asked Lacerda before his guest was seated. "My position has not changed since our last round of negotiations."\n\n"Come now, Carlos." The other man frowned at hearing his first name. Adhemar carried on. "I don't come all the way here to enjoy your sunny personality only. Kubitschek is screaming bloody murder, and every day more pansies in the legislature are starting to listen to his doommongering about the army. Not to mention that Goulart is..."\n\n"Goulart is irrelevant, and stuck in the south." Lacerda sighed. One of his phones began ringing.\n\n"Why don't you pick it up, my friend." Adhemar watched the other man. The phone rang on. "It will be good news. Those bureaucrats you tried to bribe are probably coming around to your side."\n\nThis time Lacerda's anger won out. "You fucking piece of shit, get out!" Anger distorted the UDN leader's traits. The manic energy remained, however. Ambition that burned into an all consuming fever. Adhemar knew how the other man felt.\n\nThe phone rang on. Lacerdas sighed, picked up the line. Adhemar's smile deepened. Both had much work to do."

Workers, having stopped on the way to their morning shift. Pensioners, bussed in by Adhemar to helpfully swell the crowd. Journalists, dutifully recording the speech. Here and there a few soldiers dotted the crowd, enthusiastically cheering. Little chance of beatnik trash disrupting the day's event.\n\n"And who is to blame for this crisis? Vultures, fraudsters, felons. The liberals and socialists have spent our country to the border of ruin. The desert they have made of Brazil they call a prosperous republic. Of our nation's institutions, those that still stand after a decade of graft are used as a shield against criticism. Is the Brazilian population not entitled to truth, to honesty?" A roar of assent from the crowd. "Is our Republic not entitled to good governance, to its proud place in the concert of nations?" Another roar of approval. Lacerda let the thunderous enthusiasm hold for a moment, before continuing. "My friends, the end of this period of crisis goes through a return of normalcy to politics. There is no hope for the future of the nation but the joint PSP-UDN ticket. As long as I stand I will continue the fight for our nation's future. But this fight we cannot win alone."\n\nThere, as the crowd's energy reached its highest tide, Lacerda's rhetoric would pivot into its final phase."

His alliance with Adhemar was embarrassing but had been guessed by every politically savy Brazilian and their dog. This newest partner, however...Lacerda would have been delighted to keep to distant intermediaries. Sadly little was ever simple in Brazil.\n\nThe man opposite him was some mid level bureaucrat within the PRP. A man of modest caliber. Long gone were the days where the integralists could claim to hold Brazil's future in their hands. Vargas' downfall, and Salgado's failed coup in the fifties, had sealed the party's fate. Reduced to one senator, and a few members in the house of deputies, the PRP would soon be consigned to the history books. Yet, in these historical days, Adhemar had insisted that he and Lacerda look everywhere they could for any edge in the fight with Kubitschek and Goulart. Thus the UDN's leader had found himself plunged back into old ties with the PRP.\n\nThe PRP's offer of support was enthusiastic. The integralists would support Adhemar and Lacerda. Their price, however, was non negotiable. Beyond the shame of being publicly associated with the PRP's fascist mummies, Adhemar and Lacerda would need to guarantee that upon victory, the exile of Plinio Salgado would be reversed. The integralist in chief himself would come home.\n\nLacerda sighed internally. The PRP's envoy was adamant. Having to deal with Adhemar post victory would be painful.

Occasionally one would ring and be picked up by a clerk, notepad in hand. Now and then a runner would come in. Their handwritten memo would be given to a secretary, for conversion to a type-written format. From there the message would make its day to the dais, where it would usually be read out loud. Usually, the memos were from some PSD or PTB grandee. While all waxed on the importance, every speaker's message of unity waned on the topic of who to back.\n\nThe PSD and PTB joint coalition had ensured stability and electoral success. Absent Quadros's successful bid for the vice presidency, the liberals and labourites had managed to keep the right out of power since the presidency of Gomes. Now, however, the coalition was strained from its long string of victories. Many of the PSD's members argued for a return of Kubitschek, as the more palatable candidate to oppose the army as well as a popular figure in the nation's streets. To this, the PTB's supporters argued angrily that letting the army push aside Goulart, the legitimate successor to Lott, would be a terribly damaging precedent. Besides, had Lott and the PSD not brought this crisis on through their corruption?\n\nKubitschek had not appeared much at the conference so far, beyond an opening address encouraging consensus and the safety of the coalition. Goulart, still stuck for at least another week in the south of the country, had no immediate presence within the coalition talk. His friend and supporter Leonel Brizola, however, loomed large. Wherever one went, the charismatic Brizola could be seen discussing with PTB activists and members of the PSD's left wing.\n\nPartnership and rivalry, ambition and pragmatism, hope and despair. A maelstrom of emotions whirled within the party conference. The clock was ticking to the end of the hundred days."
 brazil.104.a: "Don't split the party!"

 brazil.105.t: "The Conference Begins"
 brazil.105.desc: "Kubitschek was in it for the long haul. The former president's campaign throughout the joint PSD and PTB conference had much of the marathon about it. A most undignified sport, long distance running. Kubitschek would have much preferred a game of football with friends. Assuming his own team would not continue trying to score own goals rather than challenge the other side.\n\nOn and on he ran, the sand shifting underneath his feet. A deputy's backing there, an interest group flipped there. The strand lay ahead unbroken. Behind him the rising tides occasionally erased his footprints. Brizola had arrived and was a charismatic speaker having already managed to take a few of his supporters from him. It mattered, not, for the former president had to continue. Absent his victory, the high water would drown them all.\n\nIt frustrated him to no end that the great absent of the conference, Goulart himself, held such a sway within the coalition. The PTB's factionalists, that snake Brizola among them, agitated endlessly for their missing leader. In response, a faction of hardline PSD members had emerged. Among them was Tancredo Neves, Kubitschek's friend and protege.\n\nRight foot, then left foot. A long trail through the shifting sand. Kubitschek knew that the PTB's faction struggled as much as he did. This did not bring him much joy. The battle ahead would be difficult."
 brazil.105.a: "Kubitschek gains the upper hand"

 brazil.106.t: "The Shadow Master"
 brazil.106.desc: "Of late, whenever Edna Lott met associates their faces were long. Of course, her house's mirrors showed her own fatigue. The PTB activists had spent many sleepless nights trying to broker deals for Goulart. Had it only been a few months since her father's downfall? Since then, the PSD-PTB coalition had sailed through rough water. It was all its captains could do to save the ship from being dashed against dangerous reefs. And the military's sharks kept closing in.\n\nBrizola's eyes quizzed her. "I'm sorry Leonel. Could you repeat?"\n\n"No problem. Long days for all. As I was saying, the old man has offered enthusiastic support for Goulart. Both are in meetings of late."\n\n"Vargas' help would sway a lot of people. Both in the PSD and PTB. Kubitschek despite being a 'friend' of the old man would certainly be enraged to see his support base be swayed away from him."\n\n"He wouldn't be the only one. Army commanders would see red if they know that Vargas is still trying to play an active role in politics. Perhaps they'll forego the democratic charade and coup right now." Brizola sighed."Dear god, how did we get into this mess."\n\n"Kubitschek and my father made this bed, now they are forced to lie in it. They were fools to think the PSD's schemes would not cave in on themselves. Which way will Goulart go with Vargas, do you think? Will he take his help?"\n\nBrizola collected his thoughts for a moment before speaking."
 brazil.106.a: "Goulart will take Vargas' help."

Treasures of eloquence had already been spent on both sides of the conference.\n\nHad, then, the speaker came prepared? Packing the crowd with supporters, discovered through backroom negotiations. Or perhaps the speaker simply stood at a turning point, a sizable majority of the coalition conference willing to give credence to his ideas? Always difficult to tell where turning points great and small in history find their locus.\n\nSo it was that a supporter of João Goulart, of the Brazilian Labour Party, stood at the Dais, making his case. It was not a particularly original one; the speaker argued in favor of the legitimate president, the one meant to succeed Lott and Quadros. Threats made by conservative elements that Goulart was too far to the left were irrelevant. Brazilian democracy was sovereign. The people had entrusted the joint PSD-PTB coalition with power and responsibilities. Following the constitutions' order of succession was one of those responsibilities. Substituting Goulart with Kubitschek to fulfill the latter's schemes was not an option.\n\nThe end of the speech drew warmer applause than usual. This might not have been the end of the deadlocked conference, but perhaps the beginning of the end?"

Goulart's firebrand politics had brought the republic to a standstill. It was certainly unfair that the PTB's leader had seen his name dragged in the mud by conservative elements. But Brazilian politics was a grim and dirty place. The raison d'etre of the PSD-PTB coalition was to serve as a rampart against the machinations of any cabal of army officers and reactionary conservatives. In this time of need, a popular unity candidate was needed. Who but Mr. Kubitschek, a popular politician throughout the nation? The time had come to circle the wagons and make a stand against the wannabe putschists as one, as the coalition had done before in the 50s.\n\nThe end of the speech drew warmer applause than usual.

The members of the coalition shared, after all, a similar dream for Brazil. One that did not run through the army barracks, nor through the UDN. There was significant overlap in policy between the left of the PSD and the right of the PTB. As such all had agreed to a final vote now that the negotiations were over. The casting of ballots was pro forma, as alliance building and secret negotiations had already predetermined who between Goulart and Kubitschek would emerge triumphant.\n\nPerhaps their opponents had foreseen this outcome.

Social democrats and liberals would march behind their chosen leader with determination. Their fate in the coalition might have been tested, but their will to see the Brazilian Republic endure remained ironclad.\n\nThe votes were counted into the subsequent day's early lights.

 brazil.109.desc: "Ninety or so days ago the military's ultimatum had come. Since then, the nation's politicians had been stuck in a great struggle to see their favored candidate ascend to the presidency. In between the PSD-PTB grand coalition's efforts to maintain its hegemony and the machinations of Lacerda and Adhemar, deputies of the legislature had been bombarded with offers and counter offers, threats, bribe and attempts at cajoling. Through all this, the dark clouds had kept coming. The tempest was imminent.\n\nIf some had entered the crisis with cavalier attitudes, and hopes of making a killing selling influence, the reality of the threat had sobered all but the most foolish. With still no winning candidate and a week or so left, more and more deputies have felt uncomfortably exposed in the rising water. Best then to seek any floating piece of debris to avoid drowning.\n\nSo went the calculation for the most cynical and the most desperate. Others still refuse to abandon their principles and support the leading candidate to save their skin. What use is the democratic republic if men are not free to follow their hearts? They ask. Many of their colleagues ignore them, in the scramble to escape the army's wrath. Better to live a coward than die or be imprisoned.\n\nAs such, the current candidate for presidency with the best chance to succeed Lott and Quadros has seen a rise of support from the desperate and pragmatics. Throughout the nation, all pray that this last minute alliance will be the keystone in preventing the army's coup."

An uncontrollable smile had threatened to break through his facade of calm acceptance all day, as he shook hands and kissed babies and pretended this wasn't the best day of his damn life. Now, in private, he could indulge himself.\n\n"HELL YES!" Lacerda pumped both fists in the air and spun a quick circle. He had outmaneuvered Brazil's greatest minds (plus Quadros), secured the military's loyalty and evaded every two-bit assassin that sought to end his life. Now, the greatest country in the world was his to shape. Getúlio Vargas' insane policies and legacy had infected his homeland for too long, twisting Brazil's economic backbone into a misshapen, brittle thing. That dog's influence would be torn out by the roots in due time. For now though, there was only one thing on the agenda.\n\nPresident Carlos Lacerda walked slowly to his seat, admiring the lavish appointments and gorgeous art decorating Brazil's highest office. He lowered himself ever so slowly into his seat and pulled a list of names and phone numbers from his coat pocket. It was time his most impassioned supporters got a chance to celebrate with Brazil's newest head of state."

He only had about two years before the next election, so most staff were running double duty in the sudden rush to get organized. Ester Souza, Lacerda's faithful secretary for about twelve years now, found herself thrust into a brand new role, fielding every random, powerless bureaucrat with a bone to pick too worthless for Lacerda to deal with himself. At least she got a raise.\n\n"Yes Mr. Mikich, EVERY asset. Uh-huh. Yup, even Petrobras, especially Petrobras." She sighed and pulled the phone away, as the ever impotetent Mikich railed against Lacerda "selling off my goddamn dog next" or "licking US jackboots." He wouldn't cause any real trouble, so long as he thought he was being heard. Finally, the torrent of profanity tapered off and Ester brought the phone back to her ear.

Typically it took several months for a President to outline his diplomatic plans with the US, but Lacerda had made meeting with him a top priority. Gordon couldn't help but feel flattered. He sat across the President as Lacerda pulled a massive stack of papers from a drawer. "I understand that you are much more interested in pursuing positive relations with the United States then your predecessors, Mr. President. Know that everyone back home is eager to reciprocate."\n\nLacerda smiled. "Of course, of course. Now, before we get into the minutiae, I have a somewhat... dramatic request of you, Mr. Gordon. May I call you Lincoln?"\n\n"Of course."\n\n"Good, good. Mr. Lincoln, I need you to bring an official diplomatic request back to Washington, outlined in this," he patted the paper stack, "pile of quite official documents. In simple terms, it asks for Brazil to receive full OFN Observership, bringing us into the free world. It's time Brazil took its place in the fight against fascism, wouldn't you agree?"\n\nGordon quickly adopted his best poker face, just barely hiding his surprise and glee. This was a goddamn diplomatic coup! Bringing Brazil into the OFN would be a massive, MASSIVE success for the United States. In his wildest dreams, even with the famously pro-USA Lacerda in charge, he hadn't imagined he could get them to agree to OFN membership! He didn't even ask!\n\nGordon shot to his feet for a handshake, but banged his knee on the President's desk and collapsed back into his chair. Gritting his teeth, he nodded his head as smoothly as he could. "I, I  think I can do that for you, President Lacerda. Welcome to the, ah fuck, free world Mr. President.""

It's not like this was a surprise. Admission was basically a foregone conclusion, but it still felt damn good to hear it from the United States mouthpiece himself. He pulled a small, inconspicuous flask from his lowest desk drawer and took a quick swig. Lacerda put it back and replaced it with a sheet of paper.

The war in defence of our South African brothers was as to a righteous crusade against the forces of oppression, despite its... complications. Thousands died in that fight against fascism, and hundreds of thousands will continue to fight and die as heroes until at last, freedom's burning light eclipses Germany's darkness. Until that day, free people of the world, Brazil will fight and die alongside you!"\n\nLacerda left the podium to thunderous applause from the assembled delegates. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't quite keep a stupid little smile off his face. He was good at a hell of a lot, but if he had to pinpoint one particular skill he excelled at, it was giving speeches. Writing them too. As he made his way back to Brazil's seats, he saw an older woman applauding particularly hard from her chair next to his own.\n\n"Excellently done, Carlos! I knew that one would kill from the moment I laid eyes on it." Souza had come to New York to manage his affairs amid the hustle and bustle of the OFN's central nervous system, along with the few others he had needed to bring along.

Finally, the tall man leading his little congregation motioned Lacerda back into his car and slammed the door shut behind him, while the rest of his followers spread out to their own vehicles.\n\nWhile Lacerda was nominally in DC to do some sightseeing and a little bit of PR, the reality was more complicated. Quite a few US officials were opposed to Brazil's recognition by the OFN, and Lacerda was in Washington to make sure they saw reason.

He had been tracking this particular group for a while.

There were only about thirteen of them, but each was armed and utterly ruthless.\n\nHeitor signaled to the rest of his makeshift anti-terror squad with a few quick hand gestures, and cut the first fascists throat. His squad moved swiftly ahead of him, dispersing through the camp and ending the rest of the Nazis with similar efficiency. The few that stirred awake were easily overpowered. Heitor watched the man's lifeblood drain out into the African sand, and wondered how this little German got where he was. He couldn't have been more than twenty.

He had volunteered to stay in South Africa after the ceasefire, patrolling the ever turbulent border with the RKs and doing what he could to help the African people. While the war was nominally over, there was no shortage of Nazis and Boers that loved to "misfire" their guns through the hastily assembled chain-link fence separating them from the Republic.\n\nAs Heitor crouched behind a sandbag, one of the many in the defensive lines radiating out from the border, he could tell almost instantly that this was no everyday misfire. The fence was rattling, and he barely had time to peek over his barricades before an African man threw himself into cover next to him. The man collapsed onto the ground and gripped his leg, trying desperately to stop the flow of blood from a bullet wound to his knee. His clothes were torn from the barbed wire, but besides the bullet wound he was almost untouched. If you could ignore his visible ribs and sunken eyes, the man looked nothing like a border jumper. He looked like a scared, desperate refugee.\n\nThe first shots began to taper off, and were replaced by a loud argument in German. As Heitor wrapped the man's leg and called his squad's medic over, one more gunshot echoed over the border and the German voices stopped."

The Lobster War may have been difficult from an economic perspective, but casualties were almost non-existent. The fleet had had no problems cleaning up the pirate schooners and occasional German coordinator back then, but this was entirely different. The German's were angry and trained, intent on pushing back Brazil's maritime borders and asserting their control over more of the Atlantic. Toscano would not allow it.\n\nThe Almirante Tamandaré was leading the counterattack, and had already sunk four German vessels this week alone. The bastards had spread out over thousands of miles, attempting to overwhelm the Brazilian Navy through sheer weight of numbers, but it wouldn't matter. The SAW may not have gone according to plan, but Admiral Arnoldo Toscano would be damned before German murderers took a single foot of Brazilian water."

It would be a grand announcement, an address to the Brazilian people on his great battle against Getulism, a slash-and-burn campaign against his predecessors rampant nationalization. Privatization was the name of the game now. Healthcare, education, everything that could be privatized would be privatized.\n\nThe start of the speech was simply brilliant. First, he would make fun of Getúlio Vargas. Then, he would congratulate his supporters and issue a great call to action against all the forces arrayed against Brazil. Yadda yadda, Lott didn't fix shit, blah blah blah. The bulk of the speech was similarly genius, it was just the ending that was giving him trouble. He needed one final sell, a slogan that could be shouted from rooftops, plastered on posters, a fine quote for the history books!\n\n"Let the great flames of liberty burn away corruption!" Eh, save it for later. Not too fitting for this speech.\n\n"We will prosper once again!" Too short, vaguely fascist.\n\n"Like a great bird, I will vomit private industry upon Brazil!" What? Definitely not. Lacerda sighed and lowered his head onto the desk. This was easier when he wasn't President."

 brazil.124.desc: "A piercing whistle broke the silence of the night, followed by the tramp of boots and a shrill scream. Omar started awake at the noise and fell out of his bed, banging his shoulder on the small nightstand next to him. Cursing, he pulled himself up and moved to his window, intent on seeing just what had disturbed his sleep at this ungodly hour.\n\nFour men, all clad in body armor, were beating a boy in the street. He couldn't have been more than seventeen, but the men were beating him with batons all the same. A small bag of canned food was scattered everywhere besides him, evidently dropped in the scuffle. Ah. So these were one of the President's new "Law Enforcement Task-Forces".\n\nWith a final kick to the head, one of the enforcers slung the limp boy over his shoulder and began walking back down the street. The rest of his squad began to disperse in all directions, leaving the bag of ill-gotten groceries lying in the street. Omar closed his blinds and laid back down to sleep. It didn't work."

 brazil.125.t: "America Accepts!"
 brazil.125.desc: "Lacerda straightened his tie as he stepped out into the afternoon sun. The mob of reporters clamored for comments, firing off questions as rapidly as possible. He smiled indulgently.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen of the press, the Senado's voice is clear, Brazil stands arm-in-arm with all of freedom's defenders around the world. I would like to thank the senators for their wisdom and alacrity in guaranteeing Brazil's security and prosperity. I would also like to thank all the peoples of the free nations of the world, your elected representatives have done the right thing by extending the hand of friendship to Brazil. We will not let you down, and we will never forget the warmth with which you have accepted us. That will be all for today, thank you."\n\nHe retreated into the Palacio Alvorada, the door muting the cacophony as it closed. His mind was elsewhere, in the South Atlantic, as Brazilian naval squadrons pushed boldly towards Saint Helena in order to establish their portion of the new cordon; in the Amazonas, where rainforest was being quickly cleared for secret airbases that would form a western Air Shield; and in Berlin and Tokyo, where visions of furious generals and desperate foreign ministers filled his heart with delight.\n\nBrazil could not now be ignored. Brazil could not be dismissed as a mere trifle, a fourth-rate power with only potential and no presence. Today, Brazil had shaken the world with the strength of her voice in an unequivocal call for liberty and fraternity. She would never be scorned again."

 brazil.126.desc: "Sighing contentedly, President Lacerda took in the view of Brasília offered him by the spacious windows of the Palacio Alvorada. The skyline was dotted by cranes, and for a moment he thought he could hear the soft roar of tens of thousands of construction workers building on to the republic's seat. He sipped his coffee. It hardly looked any different, but anyone who lived through the Hundred Days would understand instantly just how much the atmosphere had changed.\n\nBrazil's position in the world had always been precarious and strange, as if they were peeking just above the edge of a great plateau where the true powers had their homes. She was the most important of the Latin afterthoughts, but hardly considered as more than a green patch on the map. Even in the World Wars her impact was minimal, only sending a desultory and uncertain force out to engage the Hun on land and sea.\n\nWith her membership in the OFN, Brazil had truly shaken the world for the first time. Every senator was now well-versed in the basic principles of conventional and nuclear deterrence, the Foreign Ministry buzzed with the activity of managing the integration effort, and best of all, the military was looking outward instead of inward-- for the first time since the second World War.\n\nEven better, the Republic's finances were now approaching a semblance of responsibility. The excesses of the old regime had been deeply damaged, and Brazil's economic growth was rapidly regaining ground as American capital and expertise bolstered her native resources and capabilities.\n\nLacerda knew he had a reputation as a dour, cantankerous operator, but today at least he felt as starry-eyed as any young communist. He smiled ruefully at that, listening for the thousandth time to his younger self calling him an imperialist running dog. With every success that voice became a little quieter, a little less sure. He had little doubt it would soon pass away entirely.\n\nThus did the Crow of Guanabara lead a little thrush through the buffeting winds of chance and circumstance..."

 brazil.127.desc: "Mr. President, we've received a startling communication from Ambassador Lincoln in Brazil. It seems that the Brazilians have requested to join the OFN, effective as soon as possible! We have prepared for this contingency of course, and the Navy is prepared to extend defensive coverage deep into the Mid-Atlantic at your command. Of course, Brazil's armed forces are comparatively weak and unimpressive, and for the next few years they may prove to be more of a liability than an asset. The decision is yours, sir."
 brazil.127.a: "We must all hang together, accept immediately!"
 brazil.127.b: "We need time to prepare, politely decline for now."

 brazil.128.t: "What Magnificent Idiocy!"
 brazil.128.desc: "Lacerda kicked his desk with the heel of his shoe, hard enough to break it off. "FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!" He roared. How could they do this to him, to Brazil? After all their support, all their friendship, they were reduced to observer status in the OFN "until circumstances more favorably align"! What was that bullshit? He would show them a favorable alignment all right, he'd favorably align their fucking--\n\nHe stopped taking a deep breath. It wasn't like this was a permanent situation. The Americans had internal problems of their own to solve, and they probably had questions about Brazil pulling its weight militarily. In the meantime they still had observer status, and they were clearly moving towards agreements with the other OFN nations on movement and trade. This would hurt his prospects for reelection to be sure, but Carlos Lacerda was not one to give in. He opened the door to his secretary's office. "Ester, I need a new desk and a new pair of shoes delivered immediately. Besides that, accept no visitors for the next three hours..."
 brazil.128.a: "I need time to think."

 brazil.129.t: "Worse than a Crime..."
 brazil.129.desc: "Lacerda bit down on his knuckles, hard. Those fucking cowards in the Senado were unbelieveable. Did they really think that the sausage-eating albinos or the Japanese would leave them alone if they shivered in the corner? He could almost feel the eyes of their generals fixing on Brazil, sticking out into the Atlantic like the world's largest soft underbelly...\n\nHe tasted blood. He unclenched his fist, wrapping his handkerchief out of his bleeding hand. Nothing would be gained by outbursts, he needed time to think. The election, the economy, the campaign against Getulism... this weakened everything. A new direction would be required, but he wasn't going to be able to figure that out today. Today, he would have a whiskey, have a cigar, and mourn the Brazil that could have been."

 brazil.130.t: "A Brazilian Request"
 brazil.130.desc: "Ever since Carlos Lacerda was recently elected President of Brazil, our agents and diplomats have watched him carefully. The famously pro-US Lacerda has spent most of his time reorganizing the Brazilian government, but he recently had the chance to meet with our Ambassador to the country, Lincoln Gordon. If Gordon's report is to be believed, the meeting went better then we could have imagined.\n\nCiting their spirited defense of Britain during the Second World War and recent intervention in South Africa, Brazil is pushing for Observer status in the OFN. This would guarantee them a seat in the assembly, without fully bringing them into the fold. Gordon is practically slavering to send back our reply. Lucky for us, there's basically no downside, both increasing our influence in South Africa and adding a powerful new ally to the fight against fascism."
 brazil.130.a: "Welcome to the OFN, amigos!"

 brazil.131.t: "The Crow Falters"
 brazil.131.desc: "His hands shook as he lit another cigar. He was already feeling nauseous, but he needed something to occupy his hands, his mind, anything! Carlos Lacerda paced his office. The curtains were drawn tight, the room lit a pallid yellow by too many incandescent bulbs. Ever since he had applied for OFN membership he had made Brazil-- and himself-- a target. He told no one, but he sometimes dreamed of albino Huns sneaking into the Alvorada through the sewers, padding softly up the stairs, knives sharp, whispering horrible promises in their guttural tongue--\n\nHe pinched his nose, hard. Obsession would kill him and Brazil as sure as any SS assassin, he knew that. Better to stay focused. He had already placed the military on a higher readiness level, anticipating some kind of retaliation for his attempt to join the Americans. A grim siege mentality was settling over the UDN as political and diplomatic pressure ramped up-- that could pose a problem if not checked. No Grey Scare could be allowed to develop, not after the close call of the Hundred Days.\n\nAt least he had the budget, right? Well, maybe not. Before his term, Brazil had not seriously faced the prospect of embargoes or sanctions by any of the major powers. He may be forced to backtrack on the Petrobras question just to provide energy security. Autarky was anathema to him, but if two out of the three great trading blocs locked Brazil out...\n\nDark times were on the horizon. Only Carlos Lacerda could provide a clear way forward for the Republic. He had to be strong, fearless, insurmountable-- but all he could see was the face of Major Rubens Vaz, going slack as his blood spread out over the Rua Tonelero. Would that sacrifice be for nothing after all? Would Lacerda have lived all these extra years just to fail at the final hurdle?\n\nThe crow beats his aching wings against the storm, blown this way and that, always frustrated, always prevented from breaking away. He screams his frustration and rage, damning the sky he used to dominate. What a pathetic delusion. As his strength begins to fail, he wonders what he will find in the dark below. Will it just be him that is destroyed, or the future of his country as well?"

Tall, gleaming in the Brasília sun, he couldn't help but gawp at their absolute scale. But he wasn't there for tourism. He had a job to do. The working staff of the Congress, cleaners, civil servants, unfortunate hangers on, all had to be delivered to the nearest police station through Brasília, and there could be no escapees. The new regime had to "ask" whoever they could for any dirt on the now angry opposition, kept under house arrest.\n\nThe soldier was commanded, with five others, to keep an eye on them. His gun heavy in his hands, he eyed a cleaning lady, about twice his age, standing idle, loitering.\n"Move along." he said, trying to be stern.\nThe woman simply looked him in the eyes.\n"Move along, or there will be consequences." he said again, forcing his tone.\nThe woman exhaled. "God did not put you on this earth to simply destroy everything Brazilians hold dear. So why do you participate?"\nThe soldier faltered briefly. "I am obeying the orders of my superiors. Now move."\n"Yet, you have a gun. You have the power and the ability to stop. Why do you continue?"\nThe soldier looked her in the eye, projecting all the intimidation he had in his soul. "Move."\nShe stood up, and walked along.\n\nThe soldier walked behind her. He had been taught to obey his superiors without fault, not to question them. He had walked in lockstep behind them, and worked hard for where he was now. So why did he feel this fear that something was wrong, that all was not as it seemed?\n\nHe shook them off."

He barely had time to flip through the act before the Generals were pushing him along to get it through the Congress before any of the more idealistic politicians of whom they had threatened their families decided that they could sacrifice a daughter or two.\n\nThe speaker introduced the act, and Congress fell into a stony silence before Müller stood up.\n"My friends."\nHe could practically feel the hate emanating from them.\n"This bill will ensure that Brazil remains a safe place, free from the tyranny of corruption, Fascism, and Communism that plagues it today."\nOne or two people in the crowd mumbled something.\n"Some would argue that liberty cannot simply be ensured this way, but, it is important we understand the good we are doing for the people of Brazil."\n\nA man in the corner looked outraged, but glanced at a nearby soldier and settled down. "Indeed, I appreciate all who take this great sacrifice."\n\nMüller took his seat once more.\n\nThe murmuring stopped.\n\nThe speaker said something about putting it to a vote. Müller watched the votes roll in. There were three or four opposition votes. It was never nice to see someone hurt themselves like that. Really a shame."

They had no need to.reconsider. But to do something, anything, to prevent the fall of Brazilian democracy.\n\nHowever, in the distance, one of the young scouts they had set up for the eventuality of "intervention", came running back. "They're coming!," the young boy cried, as he ran to his father, somewhere in the crowd. And from the distance, they could see Brazilian soldiers and policemen marching towards them, wearing gas masks. The man at the front, a thin policeman, raised up a megaphone.\n\n"You are disrupting the operation of the Port of Belém. Please disperse, and we will have no need to intervene."\n\nThe rabble of dockworkers exploded into various expletives and insults. The policeman turned around and nodded, and the army began to advance. They, of course, started with the tear gas. Some dockworkers, the less dedicated ones, scattered as they saw the gas spread throughout the air. The rest stood their ground, but many began collapsing. A single worker, his eyes stinging, walked forward, and punched an officer to the ground.\n\nIt took a moment before he was shot in the stomach. The remainder of the crowd scattered with the gunshot, running for their lives as the army marched in.\n\nBelém could run once more."

The man's morals were unquestionable, why was he so nervous?\n\n"General Castelo Branco is a good man who saw when it was needed for military intervention into the operation of the Brazilian government, and he promises everything shall return to normal quickly, after Communist and Fascist influence is purged from it. There is no reason to be alarmed, you shall still have the ability to live as you always have.

Brazil was a major chess piece in the resource battle, and they needed to keep all their pieces on the board.\n\nHe knew the Brazilian military was not politically illiterate.

A part of him genuinely believed in Brazilian democracy, that the unruly coalitions of Communist and Fascist tied politicians could somehow hold Brazil together. And, of course, every single one of them was, in their heads, thinking of the power they'd have.\n\nSo, they shored up their power. Made the right calls, blackmailed the right officers, interrogated the right soldiers. All to slowly creep into the right positions.

If the old man made anything of Adhemar's accent, he politely refused to comment on it. Both men walked to a waiting limousine, discussing in French of recent events in Africa and beyond. De Gaulle's eyes dimmed ever slightly when the topic of the French state came up. President Adhemar insisted to the president that France would be liberated without fail. The old man nodded. His strides took a little more vigor.\n\nThe avalanche of disasters that had befallen the French nation had brought many exiles to Brazil. Expatriates as they were, Franco-Brazilians still held a considerable amount of resources. Within the community, the mood definitely favored the Free French. Tapping into de Gaulle's prestige was advantageous. The French state would of course protest. And they would of course be ignored."

 brazil.145.t: "The Working Man's Man"
 brazil.145.desc: "José Alfonso's days were long. So long that his night usually turned out very short. He often found himself selling odds and ends before and after his shifts at a local factory. Toys crafted from scraps discarded on the factory floor. Working two jobs was not pleasant. In this economy, however, it was the only way to provide for his family. Those without money in this country were nobodies, trodden on by those higher up the food chain. And Zé resolved the same fate would not befall his family. He would keep them all safe.\n\nSo the young man worked day in, day out. He kept a few hours a week to play with his children. Kept time each month for a romantic outing with his wife, as the little ones were supervised by his aging mother and father. Zé worked to live. Zé lived to work.\n\nEvery now and then, the good news came out. José would stop at the post office, and receive a small envelope. Cruzeiros, from his good friend Adhemar. The former mayor had always had a lot of friends. Even now as president, Adhemar kept his thoughts to the little men. Men without any centavos to their name. Men like José.\n\nThe money was probably stolen from somewhere. What did Zé care? This was a dog ate dog country. Adhemar had shown him nothing but honesty. Votes for money. So what if São Paulo had seen some corruption here and there during Adhemar's mayorship? The economy's wheels had to be greased. Now the same process would happen to the entire country. Adhemar's envelopes gave Zé a chance to take a day off work. In turn, Zé would keep his word and vote again for his friend Adhemar."

"Time's ticking down to the next elections."\n\n"Certainly sir, but there many important issues that need our attention too." Said one minister.\n\n"Of course there are." The president said."And those sons of bitches in PSD-PTB won't let us get anything done. Come the election, they'll accuse us of having accomplished nothing, and throw us out. Hell, I'm pretty sure Lacerda and his UDN remnants will try to pour oil on the fire. Trying to fix this country can't be our first move."\n\n"What's the plan, then?" Asked vice-president Laudo Natel.\n\n"We win the people over, then we get re-elected, then we get things done, of course." Many of the assembled deputies nodded. "In this business, you gotta win over the shareholders. We don't owe shit to the idiots in Brasília. What we do need are policies for the common man. Come the election, if the average citizen feels they have more money in their pocket at the end of the month, they'll flock to our banner. An easy electoral win."\n\n"Very good, sir." Natel asked. "I imagine you've got a few ideas about whom to target?"\n\nAdhemar smiled. "I most certainly do.""

 brazil.147.desc: "The first appearance of the president on radio had come as quite a shock to many Carioca. In Rio for some business or another, president Adhemar had taken the time to drop into a popular evening radio show.\n\nOn that first broadcast, the hosts had not seemed totally sure what to do with their newest guest. Over the hour, however, the president's easy going charm and charisma worked its magic. The president's willingness to discuss topics great and small with all other guests had equally done much to make his hour enchanting.\n\nSince then, president Adhemar has appeared from time to time in various radio shows of the city. Whenever he dropped by into the city, many in Rio flocked to the radio for a chance to hear their president, far away from the rarefied air of congress. Critics have scoffed at the president taking the time to discuss latest football matches and culinary trends. His growing audience, in the meantime, has enjoyed learning more about their new chief executive."

Now that the president had pulled the rug out from under the country and gotten himself appointed president, Lu's job had taken on an even grander importance. Part of him knew he'd miss the old days of riding a motorcycle around São Paulo delivering gifts. The rest of him, of course, savored the novelty of continuing his job from within a private jet.\n\nThe hangar sat on the edge of São Paulo's airforce base. There, Lu ran over the final preparations with a strategist of the PSP.\n\n"President Adhemar is to visit the following states, in a rigid order. You and André are to invite local power brokers to meetings with the boss, to be done whenever he isn't giving speeches."\n\n"What about local PSP candidates?" Asked Lu.\n\nThe strategist looked at him quizzically. "What the hell do you mean, other PSP candidates? We're trying to help the boss get re-elected."\n\nLu shrugged. "Sure. So Laudo Natel and others, they are on their own?"\n\nThe strategist thought. Sighed. "They'll profit from our strengthened position. But priority number one is holding onto the presidency. It's a fine house of cards we've built. We can't risk it collapsing on us.""

 brazil.149.desc: "Not so long ago the area had been known as the Germans' Hill. The establishment of factories after the war had seen the once rural district turn increasingly crowded as workers and their family began to settle the place in ever greater numbers. Now the Complexo de Alemao district had become one of the newest favelas, the name given to increasingly common shanty towns built on the periphery of Brazil's cities.\n\nAs inauspicious an area as it was, president Adhemar had dropped by to shake hands and meet with prospective voters. The district's residents, he claimed, had been forgotten by politicians. The president would do his duty and help poor Cariocas like them, lest they remain stuck in grinding poverty until the turn of the millennium and beyond.\n\nA few in the crowd clapped during the impromptu speech. Others cheered cautiously. The locals were a cynical lot, and they would reserve their judgement until actual help had arrived for them. As the president began to resume his speech, a woman in the crowd began to heckle the president. Him and his party, the PSP, they were more of the same moralizing bunch, the woman claimed. Sex workers like her, small time crooks, those making in the living in the grey economy, when would they get a respite from constant police harassment? The PSP beat the drum of social conservatism. Would they continue harassing poor citizens just trying to make a living?\n\nThe president answered without missing a beat. Police officers tried to police districts where criminals aimed to take advantage of poor citizens. Helping the poor through giving them more opportunities would go along way toward reducing criminality. These opportunities would of course need to come to poor women, forced to sell their body. Brazil could not leave its daughters alone in a cruel world.\n\nA few more in the crowd asked questions. Big and small citizens, Adhemar answered to them all. Always confidently, even if the answers were not always those they wanted to hear."

 brazil.150.desc: "The greatest show on earth rolled into town one fine friday afternoon. Just as villagers returned home after a day of toiling in the field and tending to their animals, Adhemar de Barros and his campaign would roll into town in a neat formation of trucks. The President would meet with local officials. Often the town mayor. Other times, the local priest. After a brief chat, Adhemar would then head to the local bar. There the president would chat with local electors, ask them about their concerns.The president would shake his head at talks of small farmers being squeezed out by large land-owners. He vowed to fight for them. He was the only politician who would do so, he'd remind them.\n\nAfter a few rounds with the locals the president thanked them all for their time, and vowed to keep fighting for them. His convoy of trucks went off. Probably looking to hit a few more villages in the region before the end of the day. What the villagers did not yet know, was that a month or so later some money from the president's re-election campaign would show up at their doorstep. A small way to show them Adhemar remembered them."

Seems like this presidential election is in the bag."\n\n"Seems like it, Adhemar."\n\n"How is your campaign doing? And our party, in the legislative?"\n\n"We're ahead as well. PSD-PTB is reeling from our attacks. UDN is likewise taking a beating. A few candidates like Edna Lott are holding strong in the vice-presidential race, but overall the map looks favorable to us."\n\n"Edna Lott, eh?" The president swirled his coffee around his cup. "Old man Lott's daughter."\n\n"A rising force in the labour party, but still irrelevant nationally at this point. You've run a good campaign, Adhemar. Time to reap the rewards."\n\n"I hope so. Let's pray the lord we've done enough." The president said, without much of his usual bravado. The vice-president raised an eyebrow at the sight of a pensive Adhemar. Yet this moment of self-reflection faded away as the President's good humor returned after a final gulp of coffee"

 brazil.152.desc: "The cabinet meeting had seen no carryover from the Lott era but President Quadros himself. The mixture of PSD kleptocrats and PTB socialists that had continued to bleed the nation dry had seen their offices cleared within a few hours of Quadros' ascension to the presidency. It was time for the UDN to steer the ship of state back to good governance.\n\nThe first to speak for the day had been the president himself. Quadros, away from the media, had cut short his usual orations and stuck mostly to the great lines all had expected him to keep to. The republic was overburdened by spending, weighed down by bad debt. All of this would be fixed, both to help the common Brazilian man as well as to strengthen Brazil's international position in the face of big economies such as America. Foreign policy would be a second pillar of the Quadros presidency. Subservience to the United States was no longer on the cards. With no ill will to the northern republic, Brazil would look to other nations great and small for allies and friends.\n\nThe tone set for this first meeting, Quadros had his ministers present themselves in turn to their colleagues. Pride of place was given to Henning Boilesen, minister for the economy. The Danish-born former executive of the energy company Ultragaz, Boilesen was a well known figure of the country's business elite. His briefing noted the nation's mounting debt, and their importance as a threat to both the nation's prosperity as well as its foreign policy. Government spending would have to go down. The state would also retreat from the economy, freeing private citizens to act and letting them keep a bigger part of their hard work through tax reductions. Sacrifices would have to be made, yet it was Boilesen's belief that renewed prosperity would come in time."

Others kept their expression in studious contempt.The most patient had one sat closest to the standing president, eyes analyzing the strange figure in front of them.\n\nPresident Quadros carried on as confidently as he could. " - and thus it is the UDN's desire to maintain good relations between the army and our administration."\n\n"Why then, Mr. President, did you usurp your position from Lott? He was one of us."\n\n"President Lott," began Quadros over a few angry mutters, "displayed gross negligence in his corruption and in his appeasement of left wing radicals."\n\n"Lott was an idiot, but a principled one. Where were your concerns with corruption last year?" Jeered a general. Before the president could continue, field marshall Branco's voice boomed.\n\n"Quiet!" The marshall turned toward the president."Lott played politics and got burned. What matters is the future. Mr President, how will your government proceed with the chaos in South Africa? Shall the Brazilian intervention continue?"\n\n"It shall not, field marshall." At this, true chaos erupted. A strong majority of the officers began to argue with one another about the campaign in Africa, the merits of the Lott presidency, and the benefits of deeper ties with the OFN. Quadros stood in front of them all, his carefully prepared speech on the merits of a neutral foreign policy, and on the importance of avoiding unnecessary deaths of proud Brazilian warriors going up in smoke. Field marshall Branco stared at him with a neutral expression, as the debate continued to unfold.\n\nRelations with the army were not off to a fine start."

There they melted on the pages, splotching them with a mixture of ink and cheap paper. So much mud splatters, confabulation, histrionics, prevarications. Idly, the president cut ribbons from a hollowed out lime.\n\nTrying to expose Lacerda in the papers had not gone to plan. The crow had merely taken flight, while his cronies had begun returning fire. Now Quadros stood covered in political filth, while Lacerda flew above, taunting him. From evening papers and scandal rags, to respectable conservatives dailies. The latter especially hurt. At least the UDN's internal factions had not paid the failure much heed so far.\n\nCachaca, ice, lime... Sugar? Quadros dropped the knife on the table and staggered to his feet. He needed more sugar. On the way to the kitchen, he stopped by a window. Outside, Quadros could see in the distance beyond the fence a myriad of crows. A few flashes of camera. Lacerda's journalist friends mocked him all the way to the presidential palace. They'd no doubt harass the president later on, asking him questions they already had decided his answers would be. Less crows, more carrion birds, perhaps.\n\nQuadros sighed, and continued to trudge forward in search of sugar. "

How then, asked the president, could immoral behavior be tolerated throughout the nation?\n\nNot content with fighting European inventions such as fascism, racism and marxism with all the power afforded to him by his office, president Quadros had signed a new law officially banning the Crimini. This dangerous new piece of fashion, popularized by rebellious youth in the French State, crudely approximated a woman's swimming suit. Only three scraps of tissue covered its wearers' unmentionables, leaving the rest of her visible to the entire beach. Named after the French word 'mini' and the German rocket testing site in Crimea, the Crimini had exploded in popularity throughout the world. It packed a rocket's punch in only a few square centimeters of fabric. Partisans celebrated it as a rebellion against Europe's decaying moralistic regimes. Cynics saw it as a cheap way for the declining French economy to outfit every beach going woman.\n\nPresident Quadros saw it as a dangerous attack on the nation's well being. Their blood heated by the tropic's sun, how would honest Brazilian men carry on their work, knowing that a few miles away entire flocks of sun-bathing women exposed their bodies to the world? The republic's future, the Brazilian people's future, all of it depended on eradicating this new ideological threat to virtue and good moral. Already, a new brigade of police officers were being trained on the art of counter-insurgency to flush out sultry seditious sun-bathing seductresses."

 brazil.156.desc: "The position of ambassador of the Japanese Empire to Brazil had long been seen as something of a sinecure. Beyond vaguely agitating for the rights of nikkei Brazilians, the ambassador was generally given little to do. Brazil was after all deep OFN turf, and the country's business community had very little interest in anything but deepening ties to the Americans. A few Japanese operated on the margins, all the best commercial space taken over by the Yankees..\n\nThus it had been a pleasant surprise for the new President to request an official dinner with the Japanese ambassador. Over the meal, both men had discussed improved trade between the two nations, and a general thawing of the relationship.\n\nThe ambassador had long kept an eye on the eccentric vice-president and his agitation for better ties to the sphere for Brazil. Quadros' trip to the sphere had brought renewed activity to the Japanese mission to Brazil. The few embedded kempeitai agents within the embassy had even sent a few covert feelers to Quadro's office, without much success. Now that the man had turned president, perhaps some things would change?"

Throughout the years he had met politicians of all stripes and shapes. None of them quite like his new boss, however.\n\n"In your role as foreign minister, you're to get us out of South Africa." President Quadros said, pacing near the presidential office. De Melo Franco sat, his head resting on his fist. "It's important we show those yankees that Brazil will not be bossed around. The days of the automatic alignment are over."\n\n"That's excellent, sir." Began De Melo Franco, cautiously. "This is the only worthwhile policy going forward. Will I be afforded freedom from, hmm, domestic policy concerns?"\n\n"Of course, Mr de Melo Franco. I'll be holding down the fort while you go abroad." Quadros smiled. De Melo Franco nodded, doing his best to look convinced. "Onto the next step after. Brazil needs new friends, big and small. Your interest in closer ties with West African nations of particular importance. We southern nations must stand together in these troubled times. Before all this, however, the big fishes need to be satisfied. Washington, Germania, Tokyo."\n\n"Of course, sir." De Melo Franco scratched his chin and thought. This would be an unprecedented opportunity for his career, and for Brazil in general. As long as the president kept everything safe on the home front, there were many opportunities for the republic abroad. If nothing else, in these strange times, who better than this strange new president to lead the nation? So the foreign minister tried to convince himself."

Above all, Brazilian alignment with the US had to be preserved at all cost. Through all this Gordon had monitored Vargist elements and suspicious members of the leading PSD-PTB coalition. What an unfortunate turn of events, then, that the most American friendly conservative party had turned out to be the greatest threat, under its new president!\n\n"President Quadros, with all due respects, the American people look with consternation upon your efforts to leave the South African conflict."\n\n"I've meant no disrespect to America's admirable efforts to support freedom wherever it seems endangered, ambassador." Quadros's infuriating calm upset Gordon even more than his circular reasonings. "But domestic political concerns in Brazil made our continued presence in Africa untenable."\n\n"Your opposition to the South African War dates back to long before the political crisis that saw you replace Lott." pointed out the diplomat.\n\n"I'm a man of my word, Mr. Gordon. I've long argued that Brazil, while cherishing its friendship to fellow republics of the Americas, must look beyond the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific to find its own place in the world."\n\n"I understand." said Gordon.\n\nThe meeting continued for some time. The most readily understandable thing, for the ambassador, was that Brazil sat on a powderkeg. This crazy new president did not seem to realize how dangerous his efforts were to his country's stability. Gordon's job would be ever harder in the following years."

It was Quadros' turn to lose temper."Where was the American love of freedom and human rights when their soldiers broke up unions in central American banana republics? Occupied Haiti and Cuba, forced everyone onto plantations? Nations have no friends, only interests. Americans do not care one whit about slaves in Manchuria nor in Poland, only about defending their domestic interests."\n\n"Then will you sink to the American's level, mister president?"

All in all, the assembled media were in a good mood as they listened to the foreigner's ramblings.\n\n"Of course Brazil must grow closer to Asian nations." The president went on, through a translator. "After all, there are no great nations in the world than the Chinese, Japanese and Korean people." The translator, a nikkei brought over for his UDN activism, said without thinking. Korean people? The audience began whispering uneasily. Caught off guard, president Quadros' rehearsed speech stumbled. "The uh, Korean people have a specific place within the pan-asian dream, being the first nation to be brought under the Japanese empire's civilizing mission." The audience saw a few nods.

The current man inviting president Quadros to dinner was inoffensive enough. Some amiable old party members who had fallen out of favor in Germania's court politics, but not fallen out of favor enough to be sent to rot in a reichskommissariat. The ambassador seemed delighted to have some company. On his face the president could see the work of the last few years, a corrosive acid to supposed teutonic invincibility. The death of Hitler had, after all, not been kind to the supposed master race.\n\nBoth of them made small talk over some food indifferently prepared. The ambassador mentioned America and its trouble keeping blacks in their proper place. The old nazi praised in contrast Brazil for doing its best to keeping its mongrel population docile. Quadros had to bite his tongue at the obvious diplomatic blunder, and quickly changed the subject.\n\n"Have, uh, news come from Germania about any future assignment for you?

Is this a joke?" Asked a prominent Lacerdista senator. President Quadros's tone was level as he answered that he was dead serious. "You can't possibly want to give one of the nation's highest honors to some... communist piece of trash?"\n\n"This piece of trash, sir, was instrumental in helping Fidel Castro prevent a German takeover of his island. While his ideology is regrettable, Ernesto Guevara is one of the greatest latin-american patriots of our times."\n\n"Communism is antithetical to everything we hold dear on this continent." retorted the senator. "Now the Americans are stuck with a failed state a hundred kilometer from Florida. The very last thing we should do is encourage more of this nonsense anywhere in this hemisphere!" The senator continued.\n\nThe room was increasingly empty. Some of the UDN members had already made use of the debate to slip out the back door.

The aide's thoughts were led astray for a moment by the president's beatific smile.\n\n"Yes, the repeal of those restrictions. What a grand policy! I'm grateful for the support of the UDN on this landmark legislation. Brazil, the blood of old Europe and of fiery Africa in its veins, will soon have the delicate Orient as a counter-balance."\n\n"But sir, uncontrolled immigration will destabilize our country. Especially immigrants from Japan, the nikkeis cannot be trusted, sir. I implore you to change tack."\n\nQuadros put his hand on the aide's shoulder."No need for fear.

Both of them considered each other friends and mentors, and with good reason. When Kubitschek was elected in 1955, Lott had helped the constitutionalist effort that defended him against putschists. And when Lott stood for election in 1960, Kubitschek had helped show the previously apolitical Marshal the ropes of politics. Now Kubitschek was in Lott's office to discuss a new plan that the President had; since the matter of Quadros was now settled once and for all, Lott's hands were now free.\n\n"Now, Juscelino, I've followed your and Neves' way of doing things a lot of the time, and it's all well and good, but I think it's well past time for me to do something to establish myself as my own man, leave my own legacy behind."\n\nKubitschek smirked. "Oh, I understand completely. You can't very well build Brasília again, and the Transamazonian will take a good while to finish. What are you thinking about?"\n\nLott smiled slightly, saying, "I was thinking about de-politicizing the military, forcing the Sorbonne and hardliners to clam up, and making my constitutionalists the most powerful faction in the armed forces. This'll make sure that no-one will ever need to worry about a military takeover ever again."\n\nKubitschek was impressed. This he had not expected. "Quite a damn good thing it'll be if nobody has to worry about what we did.""

 brazil.167.desc: "It was a pleasant day in the Palácio de Planalto, and Henrique Teixeira Lott was putting it to good use, meeting with a predecessor of his in the Presidency, Air Marshal Eduardo Gomes.\n\nIn the past, there had been two major sources of dispute between Gomes and Lott. First, Gomes had been a member of the UDN during his presidency, and had defeated the PSD candidate, Marshal Eurico Gaspar Dutra, to gain power. Second, in the aftermath of the 1955 election, when Juscelino Kubitschek's election was threatened by a military mutiny, Lott went all the way in supporting the constitutional order, while Gomes remained neutral.\n\nThey had disagreed quite vigorously on these matters; how fortunate, therefore, that Air Marshal Gomes was willing to hear this idea out... with a few conditions.\n\n"Well, Henrique, I can back you up on this, but I'll have to ask for a few things."\n\n"And these are?"\n\n"More funding for the airforce, as always, can't let my boys go hang, and also that a few airforce clubs be left alone."\n\nLott was somewhat displeased, but Gomes' goodwill - and that of the air force -  was worth the cost, all things considered. This was for the best."

 brazil.168.desc: "It was a rainy day in Manaus, capital of the State of Amazonas, and Siseno Sarmento was angry and distraught. Despite his loyal service to the Brazilian Republic as part of its armed forces, he had been shunted off to this damned backwater to "serve as commander of the local garrison forces" (read: do nothing but inspect one-thousand reservists at dawn and dusk every day).Sure, he had been a bit too involved with the part of the military that thought that it was their duty to govern Brazil, saying that the civilians could not be trusted to rule themselves (they couldn't; the civilians were all moronic sh- idiots). And sure, he had maybe gone slightly overboard in disrespecting the then-Marshal while they were colleagues in the military (but he was a moth... entitled good-for-nothing, he deserved what he got). But this was too much, God damn it all to hell! President or no, Lott had no fucking right to treat him like this, for fuck's sake!\n\nFor the next few weeks, Sarmento's stream of consciousness repeatedly followed this line of useless complaining, while he plunged into an increasingly deep state of despair at being cut off from his former troops and from the halls of power. But after some time spent lying around uselessly, Sarmento shook himself from his slough of despond, stopped using curse words, and began to make plans to attempt a comeback under another president, cursing Lott under his breath the whole time."

He didn't want to do this to Amaury – an old friend and colleague – but he had no choice. One could not very well expect a marshal to be spared punishment after he accepted massive bribes so he could purchase large amounts of farmland and become a rancher baron overnight.\n\nAs Lott issued the order for Kruel to be dishonorably discharged for corruption and malfeasance, Marshal Denys, his defense minister, walked into the room with a concerned look on his face. "Henrique, is this really the right thing to do? You know it's going to upset a whole lot of people, step on a lot of toes all over the place. Surely there's another way of dealing with this. I know you don't even want to do it."\n\nLott sighed and shook his head. "What I want or do not want as president and as a retired marshal of the Brazilian army means nothing in front of the law. Amaury accepted such a large set of bribes that there was nothing else that I could do. He has to go, and I don't care what the others have to think about it. Besides, only the non-constitutionalists, the ones who think that they somehow know how to run the country better than the rest of Brazil does, have anything to fear."\n\nDenys nodded, but was visibly frustrated. Lott barely noticed; he was too busy wondering just where all Kruel had gotten all that money from. Years later, it would come out that it had been Adhemar that did it. For now, however, Lott was left wondering, and Denys was left displeased."

 brazil.171.t: "The Matter of the Marines"
 brazil.171.desc: "Henrique Lott had received a report from a secret investigation into the conduct of his country's marine troops, who were the amphibious elite of his homeland's foot soldiers. In theory, these troops were supposed to perform far better and be held to far higher standards than the regular army. But this was unfortunately not the case, and Lott was far from impressed with what he was looking at.\n\nThere was a semi-frequent violation of laws against corruption and abuse of power. There were reports of misuse and abuse of equipment that was given to them. There was no small number of times when marines made off with equipment after their tour of duty was over. But most concerning of all to Lott were the unsubtle 'jokes' that the marines kept making about overthrowing politicians that they did not like.\n\nThis could not be borne, and it would not be. Lott decided to act before the marines became an actual threat or were used by the hardliners to gain power. He'd need Denys' help to do this; fortunately, he knew that the old marshal would likely take his side this time around."

 brazil.174.desc: "There was no shortage of finger-pointing and shouting in the National Congress Building today, after the Senado failed to pass the Lott Act. The act intended to curb the political influence that the military currently holds by limiting and enforcing what political actions military members may take. The act was hotly debated within the armed forces, though it appears as if the Hardliner faction has taken an advantage in the military. President Lott, the primary sponsor of the act, hoped to install Constitutionalist allies within the military to root out Hardliner influence, but it appears as if this scheme has been largely unsuccessful. Furthermore, President Lott's refusal to withdraw the act drew significant anger from all three branches of the armed forces.\n\nNo stranger to military influence in their politics, Brazil's democracy is frail and prone to instability, especially given the wide range of political thought within the country. Although Brazil's military has pledged to continue defending democracy and insists that it has no current or future plans to intervene in an election, the officers' fear of a leftist-dominated government is well-known to nearly all Brazilians. This is exacerbated by the PTB-PSD coalition's desire to reform the military, which could lead to a second showdown regarding the military and politics in the future. For now, the armed forces will enjoy their current political freedoms, for better or worse."

The act, aiming to curtail the influence of the military in everyday politics and affairs, was able to garner enough support to pass despite veiled attempts by the military to sabotage the act. Ever since the Estado Novo days, Brazil's military has had a disproportionate amount of influence on its politics, and candidates would find themselves more worried about the military, rather than the issues of the day and re-election. President Lott, a military man himself, has pushed for significant reforms to the officer corps of the army, navy, and air force by installing "Constitutionalist" allies in the place of Hardliner members.\n\nThe Constitutionalists, as their name suggests, look to reduce the role of Brazil's military in political affairs, focusing purely on the defense of Brazil. In recent days, President Lott and the Constitutionalists have slowly relegated Hardliner officers to irrelevant positions, or "encouraging" them to take early retirement from the military. With a Constitutionalist majority in the military, the hope is that they will abstain from intervening in future political elections and promote a democratic transfer of power. While some in the military are not enthusiastic about the various reforms that are in the Lott Act, there is now little they can do to change the law in their current position."

A megaproject to rival the Suez Canal now stands triumphant and complete, a clear sign to all the Americas and the world at large that Brazil's fire has not lessened in the slightest.\n\nRaucous celebration is everywhere. Highway workers enjoy free drinks the nation over, political pundits breathe a sigh of relief and near every citizen takes to the streets to celebrate a clear demonstration of what a united peoples can accomplish. Even the Highways detractors are forced to admit, reluctantly, that Brazil will reap its benefits forever. Fireworks light up the skies of Brasília, of São Paulo, of Rio.\n\nThe economic benefits of the Trans-Amazonian Highway are obvious, but this is as much a political victory as an industrial one. The men and women who hold Brazil's highest offices host massive parties, celebrating the massive uptick in votes and popularity anyone in the administration is sure to gain. Foreign acknowledgements and congratulations have already begun to flood in, as the world reacts with a mix of incredulity, joy and sheer surprise at Brazil's ultimate success, its ultimate progress.\n\nA young girl watches the strange black path through a cluster of trees, and wonders at its  purpose. A sudden growl, as loud as the great machines that clear cut a way for the black stone, shakes her from her thoughts, and she runs back into the jungle.

 brazil.178.t: "Ripe Harvest"
 brazil.178.desc: "Egbeble considered himself to be very lucky to have found employment away from the brutal diamond mines of Zentralafrika. The captain, one of the many Belgians inhabiting Leopoldville, decided to overlook his background because of a serious shortage in personnel, and it showed, the people that made up the ship's crew were incredibly diverse: Germans, Belgians, and English, and, despite being the only dark-skinned member of the crew, he wasn't really put through any different treatment from his peers, something which made Egbeble grow to deeply appreciate life at sea when compared to his time at shore.\n\nHe wasn't dumb. As soon as he learnt of the job offer, he already had a vague idea of the motives behind the lack of personnel and the informality of it all, and it quickly became clear when they first spotted a Brazilian patrol boat in the distance. They were always faster and the job paid more in a single trip than what his family had probably seen in a lifetime, so he wasn't complaining despite the anxiety slowly building up in him. He'd tell himself that it'd be one more trip and he'd quit, but greed would always get the best of him.\n\nThis past month had been particularly tense: Patrol boats had gotten closer than ever, close enough to attempt to ram, and they'd also been hearing mentioned over the radio how Brazilians were ramping up their efforts. While the captain was worried and almost called the trip off halfway through, the crew, along with Egbeble, managed to convince him otherwise, after all, this harvest had been particularly great, and they'd make a fortune if they continued.\n\nHe was in the kitchen when it happened. A loud "thump" rocked the ship in all directions and he barely managed to stay on his feet. Egbeble heard the engines of the ship suddenly ground to a halt and couldn't get halfway towards the door before three men came rushing in and pointed their carbines at him. Realizing what had happened, Egbeble surrendered and was quickly brought out handcuffed to be lined up along the rest of his crew. As people shouted words in Portuguese he couldn't understand and the captives were escorted towards another ship, the sight of the Swastika being lowered to be replaced by the flag of Brazil briefly caught the interest of all those present."

Without even telling Germany?"\n\n"Yes," Lott said. "The negotiations weren't going to go anywhere and their ships continued to rob us blind. So, naturally, we had to skip to sending the Zentralafrikans a message they could understand. And now they know we aren't messing around."\n\n"This is bad Henrique, are you certain this is the right thing to do? Müller doesn't want this to get out of hand either. He doesn't want to get the Reich into a war with Brazil. And Germania might just be angry enough now to take a harder line against us."\n\n"Oh hell, it was always going to end up like this. Everyone who met the Reichskommisar says Müller's a madman. He can't see us as an equal at the negotiating table, and he doesn't have any interest in avoiding a diplomatic incident. There can be no negotiation with the Reich unless we can show them we are willing to go toe to toe. And this is the wake-up call he needs to realize we're serious."\n\nQuadros thought it over, and said "yes, I understand your point. If we were negotiating with a real African state, then things would be different, but with a Reichskommissariat... I don't think anyone wants to treat a German colony as an equal."\n\n"Correct. They're a damned colony, and that's why we take a hard line. And I think a real country would be more respectful anyway."\n\nQuadros said, "alright, Mister President, have a nice afternoon."

If there's a warning, they aren't heeding it."\n\n"So they either don't have radios or they are ignoring us, because the ambassador says it's in the Völkischer Beobachter," Lott said. "And I'm thinking Müller has decided to play chicken with us."\n\n"Mister President," said Marshal Denys, "a detention operation is still feasible at this point. Our ships are still capable of defending the coast and are willing to stay out there as long as we need them too. If we want to keep this up, we certainly could end up detaining the entire German fishing fleet in the Bay of All Saints."\n\n"We could, but that's not going to get us the results we need. And it's been told to me Germany could retaliate in some way with their ships being detained by us. They'll most likely claim some sort of compensation and take our assets if we don't give it up. The crisis needs to end, and end quickly."\n\nDenys sighed. "So it's settled, I guess. More aggressive action is needed. How much time should we give them?"\n\n"Forty-eight," said Lott. "If by that time they still want to try it, then you have my permission to take whatever action you see fit."\n\n"We can avoid the more unpleasant bits, sir," said Toscano.

Do we throw this one back to Germania?"\n\n"Not sure if they'd even notice, honestly, Reichskommisar. So, the first option is we say it's too much.

Can we call their bluff instead?"\n\n"I'll talk to Admiral Mutzelburg, but we could do it, I think. We have two cruisers and eight destroyers, which should be able to fight whatever the Brazilians have if they show up. But that may preclude a clash, and if that happens, we may find ourselves without air cover and a long way from backup." He paused.

So we gently guide them away. Maybe bump them or fire across the bow if they don't get the hint. But it still gets the message across, and is less likely to result in a firefight."\n\nLott thought it over.

And if we take mare action it just might."\n\n"Quadros is absolutely right, sir," said Denys, "but we still have options. Toscano says his forces are on the way. We can bring a force of destroyers to bear on the motor boats and tell them to move back. We'll cause damage to the Zentralafrikan station and they know this. We'll still avoid shots getting fired, but we have to respond. Our integrity depends on this!"\n\n"You're damn right it does, Marshal," said Quadros.

The mercenaries had no support, most gave up without a fight."\n\nThe relief on Lott's face was clear to see, and instantly Quadros and Denys knew things had gone well.\n\n"This ought to give Fritz the hint, sir. We're on station for more ships, but if they get wind of this I don't suppose we're going to see any more try to cross the line."\n\n"Understood Admiral," said Lott. "Tell the men we're proud of them, and we'll see how Germany takes this kick to the pants. Happy hunting."\n\nAs soon as he hung up, he looked Quadros and Denys in the eyes, and they all smiled."

 brazil.186.t: "A day on the high seas"
 brazil.186.desc: "Captain Carlos Pacheco of the Paraná thought himself lucky to catch up with the trawling fleet in such a short time. He was the first to receive the report, and the nearest to their location. He could expect the Greenhalgh and Babitonga to be on site shortly. But he was confident enough he could handle some unarmed trawlers with his old American destroyer. The Germans were going to learn they were outclassed soon enough.\n\n"This is the Brazilian destroyer Paraná," his communications expert broadcasted in English to the boats. "You are in Brazilian territory. You will leave immediately or we will take action to protect Brazilian rights." He then looked to the Captain, and the captain nodded to a lieutenant on the deck, who commenced the next phase of the plan.\n\nIt may not have been the most modern or up to date armament, but several rounds of forty mike-mike still kicked up a lot of water, and the burst of fire would still be plenty intimidating for some crab fishermen too far from where they were supposed to be. The sound of just one of those guns reverberated throughout the ship. Pacheco had five more at his disposal, along with other armament that could put holes in the boats he was tasked with scaring off.\n\nEvidently, the German bastards had gotten the message, and they began to leave. Some took their nets on board, others cut them loose and just ran. Pacheo breathed a sigh of relief as he knew this battle was over. But as the vessels pulled away, one of the officers on deck noticed something with his binoculars."
 brazil.186.a: ""They still got a lot of crabs.""

 brazil.187.t: "A Tactical Error"
 brazil.187.desc: "Several kilometers off the coast of Fernando de Noronha, a steam trawler lurches across the ocean. It flies a curious flag from its tail. The red symbolizes socialism. The white is for nationalism. And in the middle is the symbol of the aryan race Like so many vessels that have come to Brazil, it comes from a colony across the Atlantic. And once again, this colony is cloaked in pseudo-scientific racial theory and supposed noble goals to hide the blunt exploitation behind it. But this ship has not come to deliver an inhumane cargo to Brazil; it's crimes will take place far away from the shores of it.\n\nThe trawler begins to open up its giant nets from the rear. Gradually, they expand and expand until they reach from the kerning waves above to the seafloor. The Brazil basin is connected to the lands to the west, but it matters not. And after some period of time, the net is closed, and a large number of crabs who call the extension of Cape São Roque their home. The haul is put onto the deck to be processed, and the net is cast out again. Eventually, the ship will fill its stores of brazilian crabs, and then return back to the nightmare of Nazi Africa, in hopes that its catch will grace the dining tables of the Nazi elites in the home country.\n\nWho can stop this? The Brazilians, perhaps, though they've missed their biggest chance to end this pillage of the Americas. Without the stomach for direct fighting, the ships come and violate the boundary with ease. One day the Brazilian Navy will eventually shut these ships down. But until then, the vessel will always come back for another load of crabs."
 brazil.187.a: "The Smiling Man laughs again."

 brazil.188.t: "Limited Options"
 brazil.188.desc: ""It's not working," said Toscano over the radio. "We have Zentralafrikan missile boats in the area, and they're armed. Boarding operations aren't working, there have been several close near collisions with the ships and one case where we fired warning shots. The situation is looking fucked, sir."\n\n"Alright admiral, we'll update you in a minute," said Denys. And as communication ceased, dread filled the briefing room. This was a disaster, and everyone knew it. Lott, Quadros, and Denys all were aware of the predicament they found themselves in.\n\nLott was the first to speak. "We stay the course," he said. "We said we were going to board, and we will. Let's tell Toscano to continue the plan."\n\n"That's not going to be the best action, sir," Denys said. "We're evenly matched. Going further would almost certainly lead to a shootout, one that it's not certain we would win. Casualties would be unacceptable, and the diplomatic repercussions would be extreme. Our forces are not prepared for this, sir."\n\n"I gave my word as the President of Brazil that we would board the ships regardless of cost and we will!"\n\n"Denys is right," barked Quadros. "This is far too risky, we need to tell the fleet to disengage!"\n\nLott was taken aback at this change of opinion. "But you said-"\n\n"The hell with what I said-things are worse than I thought! We must pull back now before we get into a war!""

 brazil.188.c: "Alright, things are far too much."

 brazil.189.t: "Rough Waters"
 brazil.189.desc: ""Fuck you too!" screamed a junior officer as the Paraná slammed into the Hitlersburg on its right side. The Brazilian Pará-class destroyer was much larger than the German Pelikan-class corvette, so it was no hard feat to force the ship to alter its course.  A cheer went up among some of the crew at this action, but Captain Carlos Pacheco winced inwardly. He knew this would cause minor damage to his vessel, but he had more immediate concerns.\n\nThis was by far the most hostile action he had undertaken in the time he had been observing the fishing convoy. Not that it was unnecessary; the krauts had been running nearby far too close for his comfort for a while now, and the little bastard was a perfect opportunity to send a message. But this was an escalation, and now it remained to be seen how the other guys would respond. He was wondering if his 5-inch cannons could take out a Pelikan-class in one hit. He hoped so.\n\nBut as he looked at the other escorts, he almost missed a trawler cutting its net and dropping it into the water. That vessel quickly started steaming out to the east. Then another pulled it in and left too. More and more followed. The Babitonga, on station nearby, also reported the sudden movement.\n\nFinally, it was clear there was a general retreat amongst the trawlers. With the ships leaving and the Ipiranga beginning to shadow the unescorted interlopers, the kriegsmarine had to pull back. Pacheco breathed a sigh of relief. The fishing operations were evidently too dangerous for the huns to complete with a war about to break out in front of them. And he was secretly glad they broke, because he was feeling like Brazil might first if this had kept up."

 brazil.190.t: "A Commentary"
 brazil.190.desc: ""The ending of the so-called Lobster War is one that has proved its full impact in time," says the opinion in the Tribuna da Imprensa, written by the editorial board but almost certainly the true thoughts of Carlos Lacerda. "Unfortunately for Brazil, the impact has always been evident from the very first mistake by Henrique Lott.\n\n"To set lines is well and good. It is to be expected for a sovereign nation. However, to set lines and boundaries that you have no intention of enforcing is far worse than refusing to set lines at all. The government had promised to protect the fishing rights of Brazil, and to defend the livelihoods of those who depend on the spiny lobster harvest. The government sent forces to board the Germans who would seek to violate this part of our nation. But when the Nazis backed up their willful disregard for our country with force of arms, our President chose to retreat like a coward.\n\n"Everything we feared with such a dereliction of duty has come to pass. Once again, the Germans plunder our seafloor, and what should rightfully belong to our fishermen is being taken to the heart of the slave world in ever-increasing quantities. Sure there may come a time when it is no longer economically viable for the Kriegsmarine to send ships to escort every trawling action. And perhaps then Lott may be able to take action once he faces no challenge whatsoever. But it remains clear Brazil has been humiliated by a colony-not a state-and can be bullied into submission by a few obsolete corvettes.\n\n"A government's sole duty is to provide for its people and defend their livelihoods. Brazil under the Lott presidency has failed that aspect of the social contract. And the lobster fishermen now pay the price.""

Denys closed his report and looked at Lott. Lott had almost certainly ignored the last part of the report, with more substantial matters on his mind. And Denys didn't think those matters were important either when it came down to it. "Sir," he said, "it wasn't worth it. Not in the slightest."\n\n"There are sacrifices in war, minister," said Lott. "we couldn't back down. Not in the slightest. I don't think we could have done it differently."\n\n"There's a number of coffins with Brazilian flags on them over some fucking lobsters," Denys said. "And the dead Germans. .. they aren't going to like this. We just guaranteed a carrier task force near São Luís."\n\n"Germania couldn't give a shit if you fed them raw chicken and a laxative," Lott responded. "Nobody knows if that fuck is even still alive or if he knows why he won't eat lobster thermador tonight. The hun's an arrogant bastard, but he's not going to start a war in the Americas. Not while his government runs around with its head cut off."\n\nDenys and Lott still were unsatisfied. "Quadros is mad things ended this way too," said Denys.\n\n"Well, I used his fucking strategy, and that's just how things ended up with it." Lott still wouldn't look Denys in the eye. "But all that matters is we won. Nobody is going to try anything like that again with how well Zentralafrika's attempt worked out.""

 brazil.192.desc: ""Men," Lott said at the head of the table, "in my career, there have been very few times like this one tonight, and it certainly is one you will feel the same way about as well."\n\nThe officers of the Brazilian 3rd Naval District Command had gathered in the Banquet Room of the Palácio da Alvorada. They were all excited to be there, after a long period at sea facing down the German Navy. Admiral Toscano and Marshal Denys were there, and both were happy as well. Even Quadros was happy to be a part of the festivities, and had a right to, by all means.\n\n"Truth be told, I thought I would never have a moment like this one. When I was in Britain, a lot of us entertained the notion we could turn the tide and force the Germans back. That we could save a country with our efforts and our efforts alone. But that didn't happen, and it has eaten at us ever since."\n\n"Some have thought this would mean the end of the free world. That the forces of hate and tyranny could always humiliate and abuse the democratic nations. And nobody expected that one day any free nation- let alone one in South America- could stand and hold its own. Certainly few in this country did, but our pride and honor demanded we set a line."\n\n"By your work, and by your work alone, that line held. Brazil is now the only nation in the history of the 20th century to win an unequivocal victory over fascism. Nobody, not the Americans, not the British or French Empires, has done what you have done these past few weeks. And now, we can take pride in the worst defeat of the German Navy since the Graf Spee was scuttled."\n\n"Gentlemen, we drew a line and the Germans could not cross it. As you enjoy this wonderful menu of lobster-based meals specially prepared for the occasion from the very same shellfish you protected at sea, you will keep in mind this meal was possible because you kept the new world secure from the disasters and downfall of the old." Lott raised his glass, and the entire table followed."

The notice has been sent to Müller."\n\n"This is the right thing, Senhor Presidente," Quadros said. "We need to talk this over with him. He's a nut, but it's far better if we can settle this with the Reichskommisar peacefully than to end up in a war with the Nazis right off the bat."\n\n"I don't like it," said Denys. "The whole thing is shaping up to be an exercise in futility. Müller doesn't care about if he sparks a war with us. From what I hear, Africa is a mess wherever you go aside from Hitlerstadt. We'd be better off if we sent the letter right to Germania."\n\n"So they could throw it in the trash bin? Müller isn't prideful enough to allow this to escalate without solving it. And more likely he doesn't want to be the Reichskommisar to spark a war on the other side of the Atlantic."\n\n"This is still an embarrassing situation," said Lott. "We can't be negotiating with a German state like this, it's humiliating."\n\n"I could still call Toscano, sir," Denys said. "Give us 24 hours and we'd have a fleet ready for the boche-"\n\n"No, we aren't turning back now," said Lott. "We are set, solve this diplomatically.

"And apparently they think we have to call them or they get serious about this and they end up fighting Germany over this."\n\n"So I'm the one who has to save the world from another war? Well, should we call them over or not?"\n\n"Um...there are advantages, herr Reichskommisar. We could defuse this issue before it gets any worse and make sure there are enough lobsters for the two of us. But that would require a level of, um, deftness to prevent the higher powers from finding out?"\n\n"Germania? They don't fucking care. Call the Afrikaministerium, who gives a shit?"\n\n"I'm talking East, not North, Reichskommisar."\n\nMüller remembered. "Fuck.""

"Alright, you go for it. The Air Force will have a plane gassed up and ready to fly to the Heart of Darkness for you. Call it in, and they should give you a jet at Recife. What time do they want the meeting?"\n\n"Well, as soon as possible."\n\n"Alright, then I guess you take a shower at Recife. Just remember Salles; you need to stay low profile because we're not sure if Germany knows what's going on down here. No entourage, no press, one aide, and the aircrew. You can have a bodyguard for the plane, but don't expect the Léopoldville consulate or the Brazilian armed forces to be able to support you if things go south. We cannot guarantee a timely response in Zentralafrika."\n\nSalles was slightly off-put by this. "Yes sir."\n\n"And one other thing: we have to come out ahead.""

"We had to check it over, but this seems like as good an answer as we're going to get."\n\n"He told me to go fuck myself," observed Lott, who kept reading the document.

 brazil.197.desc: "Lott stayed sat in his chair sitting quietly thinking about the situation, rubbing his chin as he looked at the report Quadros gave him. Quadros was pacing around the room muttering to himself about the situation. Tancredo Neves and Celso looked awkwardly between each other and after a brief conversation between the two's eyes, Tancredo coughed.\n\n"Ahem, I believe we will need to deal with this situation quickly.... the economics and Peasant Leagues. We should deploy Jango to go talk to the Peasant Leagues, he is fairly popular and could convince them to calm down. Send trusted officers to investigate the situation find out who did it."\n\n"I agree with that excellent proposal, most likely the first and the last I will agree with Tancredo on," Quadros exclaimed out loud. "Goulart may have incorrect views on economics but those groups support him and Brizola, wheeling him out may help."\n\nLott nodded surprised that the room agreed on this issue "I will be on the call to Jango immediately, I will get him to go out and talk to the leagues, hopefully, it can stop the situation from descending into chaos. And on your economic proposals Tancredo I believe these could be." But before Lott could finish his speech Quadros interrupted him.\n\n"Henrique, don't tell me you are going with their plan. Their plan will only boost inflation, we need to cut taxes, crack down on inflation and deal with the growing debt if we want the economy to continue to prosper."\n\n"Thank you Jânio for your interruption." Lott said plainly. "I will of course listen to all advice and I have not yet decided my action. Jânio you and keep a watch on the situation I will be calling Jango. Tancredo and Celso, thank you for coming you are dismissed." Lott said, with that the three men nodded their heads and one by one left the room.

As Lott set aside his papers, he noticed that Quadros had an unusually large folder, no doubt filled with economic plans and agreements.\n\n"Gentlemen, let's get this meeting started. We all know the issue that faces us at hand. Our debt is growing to a staggering amount, and we must take action of some sort against it. Now, Jânio has written up a solid plan that both cuts costs, and looks for a partner to refinance and restructure a portion of our debt. While we can discuss the cuts to the budget in a second, I want to make sure that Salles; you've spoken to the Americans about this, yes?\n\n"Correct, Marshall Lott. I plan to meet with Gordon soo-" "What?! The Americans?!" yelled Quadros. "We can't trust those dogs to give us a fair deal whatsoever! They're purely looking to exploit us at every turn!" Lott rubbed his temple, before responding, "Sure, Jânio. It's obviously not going to be perfect, considering the amount of debt we're trying to restructure, but exactly who else can even take on this much debt?"\n\n"How about Japan? They can just as easily finance our plan, and we could develop a relationship with a potential new ally." While the rest of the cabinet shared looks of bewilderment, Lott shook off the quizzical look on his face, saying "We already have a good ally in the United States. Working with Japan on the austerity plan is sure to draw their anger. Is it really worth it, Jânio?" Lott looked around the room, to see most of the heads nodding in agreement.\n\n"Well, you know my stance. I'm sure you already made a decision with consulting me, as per usual. Just say the word, and we'll get to work on our debt." replied Quadros, in a dismissive tone."

They should be drinking mate, not this green sewer water, he thought. "Vice-President Quadros, I hope you are well." said the trade minister as he entered a bow. Quadros still wasn't used to this custom, and he attempted one back as well. "Trade Minister Goto, it is an absolute pleasure to welcome you to Brazil. I hope we can have some discussion regarding a potential trade deal and our economies?"\n\n"I understand that your government is in a significant amount of debt, Vice President Quadros. The Sphere is ready to help you with the continued development of the Brazilian economy, if you are also willing to do the same for us."\n\n"Of course, Minister Goto. Why else would I invite you here? I was hoping to discuss the potential start of a trade agreement, to pay for the restructuring of a small part of our debt. If you would be so kind as to look at my proposal, I think there's a lot that benefits both of our nations." Quadros smiled as he pushed forward an envelope with the Brazilian seal containing a set of development plans, tariff reductions, and corporate agreements. Much to his surprise, the Japanese representative layered his own folder directly on top of his, and gave a forceful shove back.\n\n"Vice President Quadros, I insist that you look over our plan first and discuss it with your cabinet. We will start there. Please let me know as soon as possible when you and your economic ministers have reviewed our proposal. Thank you."\n\nQuadros' shock and anger had barely registered before the Japanese trade representative left the room, leaving him alone with a heavy folder that he had to carry."

Neves cracked a laugh, but no one joined in with him. "If we agree to this plan, we're out of our mind. This is guaranteed to make us a subservient state to the Empire of Japan. At this rate, we should just enact the austerity policies ourselves, and just make it so that we're at least only screwing ourselves, rather than letting ourselves be screwed by someon-"\n\nQuadros stood up empathetically, and clapped both of his hands. "Minister Neves, that is the smartest sentence that has ever come out of your mouth! I am thrilled to see that you agree with my ideas on how to fix and improve our economy. Let me toss this Japanese trade agreement in the trash like you said, and we can quickly get to work on what fat can be trimmed from our spending programs."\n\nPresident Lott raised a hand to object, and replied "Gentlemen, enough with this. I think that there are some very obvious downsides, such as the potential land grants that we would be giving the Japanese Zaibatsus, but you cannot deny that there are still benefits for us in this plan. We need the help we can get, and there's no guarantee that anyone else will help us with our debt."\n\nAs the men continued to debate in the room, it was eventually agreed upon that:"

Even though the United States was supposed to be a close ally of Brazil, Salles knew that there was no such thing as goodwill when conducting policy between two nations. As he clutched his proposal tightly between his arm and his chest, he opened the door to the meeting room.\n\nInside sat Ambassador Lincoln Gordon, along with what Salles assumed to be an aide. "Walter, good to see you again! I understand that we're here to make some deals happen?"\n\n"Sure, Lincoln. If the United States is willing to help us with our debt issue, there's plenty of room to talk business." Gordon took another puff from his pipe, and pulled out several documents before sliding them towards Salles. "Here's what we're thinking, Walter. Just some generic stuff about lowering import tariffs on your end compared to the ones on the Pakt and the Sphere, making our goods slightly cheaper for your people. Furthermore, I need a guarantee from your government that you lot are committed to the free market.

As he continued to look out the window and adjust his tie (why did it have to be so damn hot here, all the time?), the car came to an abrupt stop in an abandoned industrial park. His translator motioned towards him to get out and take a look for the new land that Mitsubishi had just purchased.\n\nMakoto couldn't believe how large the space was in total. Although all of the factories needed to still be torn down, he anticipated getting enough space for a couple factories, and maybe a small space for trucks to park. Rather, it seemed to him that there was enough space for at least ten factories and a processing center, far larger than what he imagined. How much did the board purchase this land for, Makoto wondered. Now he began to understand: this position wasn't a demotion, but a promotion. There was a bevy of opportunity, and the potential was limitless. As construction crews, cranes, and equipment began to be unloaded on trucks behind him, Makoto cracked a smile.\n\nThere was a lot of work to do, but Makoto was no stranger to that.

He spoke of not bothering of what-ifs, but his mind was completely troubled of what-ifs, has been and could be, words he could have spoken, promises he could have demanded payment, or simply stood his ground, staring at the beast in its face...\n\nThe grim, depressing mood in the Presidential Palace couldn't be more different than the cheerful, ambient at the barracks as officers and generals praised each other with drinks and cigars, at a moment where they finally got the bull to stand down. Sure, they would have to watch out to whoever succeeded Lott, the bill was simply archived, but that would be a worry of another day.\n\nToday, they simply celebrate their victory over excessive liberalism."

 brazil.207.t: "Murmurings of Insurrection"
 brazil.207.desc: "Lott wasn't a particularly talkative person, a man pragmatic to the extreme, that let his action and expressions speak what a thousand words couldn't; in short, anything unlike almost every other politician in the country.\n\nAnd yet, as Denys stared at Lott, his expression utterly unreadable, he wished he would speak something, anything really, because the silence in the room was getting to a suffocating level. Thankfully, before Denys would say anything, or try to pry any word from that man, Lott broke the tense silence, all but tapping the folder Denys brought with him.\n\n"And you're saying your men are starting to talk about..."\n\n"Mutiny, yes. Your act is having the people in the headquarters anxious, Lott, you can't deny it."\n\n"Good. I want them to squirm in their boots."\n\nDenys couldn't help but frown, his brow furrowing as he stares at Lott, adjusting his tie...\n\n"Lott, we've both been on the Cadet school, you need to listen to me. I know the generals can get uppity about the state of things, but this is openly antagonizing the army. We're not the bloody enemies of the state, we're here to-"\n\n"Spare me the talk Denys, I've done my vow to the flag too. Two, in fact," Lott emphasized, pointing to a single bevel pin on his chest, the badge of the Brazilian republic. "I'm not backing down Denys, they need to know their place."\n\nDenny's eye can't help but twitch, the incredulity and irony of the statement not being lost on him...before he sighs, giving a simple shrug."Can't say I didn't try, Lott."\n\n"Very well, you're dismissed."\n\nAs Denys saluted and left the room, the bravado in Lott collapsed, the man reclining on his chair with a heavy sigh and heavy heart, looking at the door his friend left; he gets it, he does, but he simply can't allow something like what could have happened.\n\nHe's a military man, after all. He knows the last thing Brazil needs is more power in the army's hands."

 brazil.208.t: "Salles travels to Zentralafrika"
 brazil.208.desc: "There was no accurate way to tell the time here. He lost count of the time zones, so he had no idea how late in the day it was. Sure, Walter Moreira Salles had timed the hours from Recife in the afternoon. But all he knew was Hitlerstadt was the middle of nowhere, and it was dark.\n\nHe knew things were going to take a turn for the strange when the jet switched over from the US Airbase on Ascension Island to Léopoldville Traffic Control. As they came from the Gulf of Guinea, the order came to gain altitude and fly high and fast to avoid ground fire. This unnerving notice made Salles fearful of what was going on down in the jungle. Even on approach to N'djili Airport, the aircraft had to make a rapid descent in a corkscrew motion to land, giving Salles a side window completely filled with land. He needed a drink as soon as the tires touched the ground, and they found a bottle of schnapps at the airport as the jet refueled.\n\nThe flight to Hitlerstadt was worse. The same maneuver had to be done to take off from the ground. The air offered no relief, as the safest way to fly around the potential anti-aircraft was straight over the lake. With the sudden opening of a vast ocean somehow in the middle of Africa, and rumors of how many aircraft were lost over the monstrosity circulating around the aircraft, Salles had no rest nor comfort for what he was about to do. Not that him standing on a semi-deserted airstrip in the middle of nowhere on a moonless night would help him anyway.\n\nThe headlights appeared in the distance. Four or five Kübelwagens and Mercedes-Benzes in green camo pulled up in front of the plane. Front two had machine guns mounted. Salles saw groups of soldiers get out with G1 rifles and face the plane. One in a beret came up to him and saluted. "Welcome to Hitlerstadt, Herr Salles," he said in accented English."
 brazil.208.a: ""Generalfeldmarschall Rolf Steiner, at your service.""

 brazil.209.t: "Salles eats Lobster"
 brazil.209.desc: "The romantic notions of African hunting lodges or grand colonial era hotels Salles had did not materialize at the Hitlerstadt resort. The Egyptian or South African hotels had a certain old charm for them. Even the newer Hiltons or Yamatos would have at least a modern appearance in their interior, even if the structures looked the same if you looked at them enough. Hitlerstadt was, on the other hand, nothing more than a collection of Proras. A cement monstrosity more suited to be a blockhouse guarding the white beach than a place of relaxation and entertainment. The special suite he was staying in was thankfully removed from the main complex, but it looked more designed to mirror Goering's home than an afro-German design.\n\nAmusingly, most of the wait staff were native Africans, dressed in the white uniforms of the SS mess waiters. Somehow, despite the propaganda, even here the Germans were unable to block the influences of the land they plundered from. Inside the dining room, decorated with various trophies from long-deceased animals was a giant table made from rare wood in the jungle. And far on the other side was Rolf Steiner, wearing his same field uniform with the beret still on his head, nursing a glass of Gaffel Kölsch.\n\nThe dinner was a surprise, but not a pleasant one. The unveiling of the lobster bisque, with lobster tails, asparagus, and potato salad no doubt gave Steiner a source of amusement, but it put Salles off. All the time, though the French wine they paired it with was wonderful, he couldn't help but think about where this had come from. No doubt these should be in a Brazilian household, sold off by a local fisherman who now may have had to go hungry because of what these bastards did.\n\nThe conversation was mostly small talk, with Steiner sharing off-putting tales of his time in the military and his childhood. After polishing off the lemon cheesecake, Steiner finished off his second glass of beer, before looking at his adversary."
 brazil.209.a: ""Shall we begin, Herr Salles?""

 brazil.210.t: "Discussion over Trade Begins"
 brazil.210.desc: ""The whole middle bit of the Atlantic, that?" asked Steiner with a degree of hostility. "That's everyone's ocean! Us, the Japs, the Yankees, everyone has a right to it! How the fuck do you think you can take a part of it and kick us out?"\n\n"The Cape Verde Pain," said Salles, "is neutral territory for shipping and fishing for the most part, yes. But there remain certain territories by international law that belong to the people of Brazil. The continental shelf of South America is by law Brazilian territory, and our government has the right to regulate the harvest of spiny lobster from the territory."\n\n"But..." Steiner began as he took a sip of his beer, "they're fish, aren't they? They swim. And that isn't on the continental shelf, so they're in the water, and they're fair game."\n\n"You may say that, but our view is we have a right to stop you if you keep wanting to harvest the lobster there. You need to stop it and abide by our regulations, that's what this is about."\n\n"Alright...so what are your regulations?"\n\n"Excuse me?"\n\nSteiner smiled. "Lemme spell it out for you: how much can we fish there? What's your deal to end this horseshit before it gets any worse?""
 brazil.210.a: ""We'll give equal access.""
 brazil.210.b: ""Some fishing will be permitted.""
 brazil.210.c: ""You need to pull out entirely.""

 brazil.211.t: "No Fish for You"
 brazil.211.desc: ""It's the view of the Brazilian government that you need to pull all fishing activities from the coast of Brazil immediately."\n\nSteiner nearly spat out his Kölsch. What the fuck did the Brazilian just say to him?\n\n"There is far too much overfishing in the area, and we must conserve our reso-"\n\n"No," he said, "you don't have an overfishing problem, you have a problem admitting the fucking ocean is supposed to be for all of us! Where else do you want to get the lobster? The lake?"\n\n"Perhaps that's a better option," Walter Moreira Salles said. "And you could convince Hitler to make Moskowien a lake to harvest them there like he said in Mein Kampf. Far better than telling him you sparked a war by overfishing."\n\nFuck, Steiner thought. This was bad. He could suck it up and try to get something for it later on, or he could push hard for at least some fish. He could also leave the room immediately. Sure, Reichskommisar Müller wouldn't like it. Or he wouldn't care. Or he'd call him a badass. That was up for debate, the man was hard to read.\n\nBut he mulled it over with another sip of beer, and found liquid courage."
 brazil.211.a: ""Alright, fine, we'll leave you alone.""
 brazil.211.b: ""Be reasonable here, we can work a deal.""
 brazil.211.c: ""Tell the U-boats about the continental shelf!""

 brazil.212.t: "Some Fish for You"
 brazil.212.desc: ""Brazil's President has instructed me to tell you he is open to a negotiated settlement regarding lobster fishing."\n\nThat perked up Steiner's ears. "So... how much do we get?"\n\n"That depends." Salles explained "There would be regulation, inspections, and requirements regarding Brazil's role in all of this-"\n\n"But we would be able to still fish and sell them back to Germany?"\n\n"You would be able to conduct limited fishing operations in the Cape Verde area, yes."\n\nThat was music to Steiner's ears. With the Brazilians open to talking it out, he could call it right here. They still get to do the fishing, and the Brazilians got to claim a favorable deal. There was much more that had to be negotiated tonight, and he could easily just accept the deal in order to get the rest over with. Might impress the bastard over there too.\n\nBut was that what he wanted? Sure, it was risky, but he could push for more. Much more. He had his foot in the door now, and he could easily press them for more. Though the beer in him might have been the one saying that."
 brazil.212.a: ""Herr Salles, you have a deal.""
 brazil.212.b: ""Be reasonable here, we can work a deal.""
 brazil.212.c: ""What right do you have to regulate the master race?""

 brazil.213.t: "Equal Access"
 brazil.213.desc: ""We are willing," said a clearly nervous Salles, "to recognize the fishing rights of the Grossgermanches Reich in the area around Cape Verde."\n\nOkay, that was something. Enough to get Steiner to pay attention to what the Brazilian was saying.\n\n"The lobster trawlers and other ships will therefore be allowed-"\n\n"So that's it, correct?" pressed Steiner. "You guys are giving it up?"\n\nSalles gave a solemn nod.\n\n"Excellent! No more need for talking, we accept your proposal!" Steiner finished his drink, set it down, and let out a relaxed sight. Then he called to the waiter, "another round for me and the fine Herr Salles here!"\n\nSalles wasn't looking so hot as the waiter went to the bar. Steiner didn't care. Though he almost forgot what else would be decided tonight may not be so easy. The Brazilian may have been aiming for something better later on.\n\n"So Herr Salles," he said as the next beer arrived, "what do you wish to discuss next?""
 brazil.213.a: "We break out the maps..."

 brazil.214.t: "The Germans Respond"
 brazil.214.desc: ""That's unreasonable, Herr Salles," said Steiner as he thought it over. "The fishermen need to have some sort of income, and fishing off the Gulf of Guinea holds all sorts of issues. Have you seen the mess over there?"\n\n"I believe I have," Salles said, "though perhaps the bombing you do has something to do with it."\n\n"Almost certainly, but that's more an issue for Schenck and Germania. We wish to have good relations with the locals but it's a hotbed of anarchy, so we have to farm elsewhere. Surely you understand why we fish on the other side of the Atlantic? We need to have at least some of the crop to sustain our operations."\n\nBingo. Now the Germans were backing down. Salles smiled. His plan worked perfectly.  They could come up with a compromise now. His hard line on the subject had paid off. All that was left was to make the deal and then move on to the other subjects at hand.\n\nOr should he? It was half a loaf, but Brazil might want the whole thing. Lacerda may roast him over the coals for even this accomplishment. Perhaps he could try to see just how hard Steiner was going to push for this. Or if he would give in or leave because of it."
 brazil.214.a: ""We'll come up with a number for you.""
 brazil.214.b: ""It's still our lobsters.""

 brazil.215.t: "The Germans Reject"
 brazil.215.desc: ""You aren't really arrogant enough to think you can limit us, can you?" asked Steiner, his voice rising.\n\n"I beg your pardon?" asked Salles.\n\nSteiner took another sip of beer. "You want to claim that anything in the Atlantic Ocean that touches the ground is Brazilian property. How? You think you can bully us into giving up our way of life to you? What makes you think you have a right to do this?\n\n"You will not be able to go into Brazilian waters and take our animals and livelihoods," Salles said bitterly. "There are rules civilized nations must follow, and we will stand up to defend our rights as a sovereign nation. Now think, Rolf, do you want to escalate this? We're meeting you halfway on this, but we cannot go any further!"\n\n"We can," said Steiner, "and I've seen your fleet and how it compares to the Kriegsmarine. You wouldn't have a chance if you stood up."\n\nThis was bad, terrible even. That was the reasonable agreement the drunken kraut had tossed. Now, Salles would have to either accept this threat or he would be needing to leave this table and say diplomacy had failed."
 brazil.215.a: "Leave with a bowed head."
 brazil.215.b: "Leave while looking him in the eye."

 brazil.216.t: "The Lobsters Settle"
 brazil.216.desc: ""So that's it then," said Salles. "We have come to an agreement?"\n\n"Yes we have," Steiner concurred. "I guess now we can call this lobster conflict over."\n\nSalles let out a deep breath. Things were now much better than before. He knew the fish were going to be the biggest hurdle toward any deal. But now that had been settled... things looked so much easier after what had gone on before. He relaxed a bit and took a sip of water.\n\nSteiner on the other hand, maintained eye contact with Salles. He knew there was still going to be a long night ahead of him And the way this was going, he may need more than another beer to keep his nerves steady.\n\n"So what's next?" asked Salles.\n\nSteiner snapped his fingers and a mercenary brought forward a map of the South Atlantic, with a pen and a ruler. Salles knew what was next."
 brazil.216.a: "Time to carve up the seafloor."

 brazil.217.t: "The Debate Over Naval Boundaries"
 brazil.217.desc: ""With the fishing rights dispute out of the way," Salles began, "we can now move onto the claims of Brazil as to the seafloor. And our proposed exclusive economic zone will clear up any other concerns you may have."\n\nSteiner just looked at him. "Show me."\n\nSalles stood up and walked to the map. Steiner followed, beer in hand. "So previously, the position of the German government was that Brazil had exclusive rights to all seas twelve miles off the coast, but with the advances in underwater mapping, we can tell the Brazilian continental shelf goes much further than that. Therefore, we claim all operations..." he began to draw a line with the help of the ruler measuring distance from the coast. "...to here, this line. About three hundred and seventy kilometers. The shelf extends further in many places, but this would give us a nice reserve to work with."\n\n"Well," said Steiner as he took out a pen of his own, "if we said we wanted three sixty clicks, that means..." He stopped after the first mark. It was clear his demand would come nowhere close to the edge of Salles' line.\n\n"The Government of Brazil," said Salles, "will accept your territorial claims."\n\nSteiner nodded. And another aspect of the treaty was settled."
 brazil.217.a: "Now we focus on the crews."

 brazil.218.t: "A Question of Sailors"
 brazil.218.desc: ""Alright, Herr Salles," Steiner said as he took another drink of Gaffel Kölsch, "we would now wish to discuss the issue of all the fishermen you've taken into custody since this nonsense started."\n\n"Yes, let us do so," Salles agreed. "If you are aware, many of them are about to be charged with several criminal offenses related to fishing in restricted waters. Not to mention the few who tried to throw punches with the marines."\n\n"And I assume the PSD is very happy they have something to trot out to distract the media," said Steiner. "But, of course, any decision regarding this crisis has to take into account the fishermen you have abducted. The kidnapping of scores of Aryan workers by your mongrel navies isn't something that can be tolerated by Germania."\n\n"Aryan? Most of them were native Africans!"\n\n"Both sides of this dispute must have a propaganda edge, Herr Salles," Steiner said coldly. "I am well aware only a fraction are even Germans from the Reich proper, but it sounds better for back home, doesn't it? Zentralafrika is a more multicultural place than most realize." He gave a wink to the native waitstaff in the SS mess uniforms.\n\n"But that's beside the point, Herr Salles. The way I see it, the citizens of the Reich must be returned...""
 brazil.218.a: ""...immediately.""
 brazil.218.b: ""...at the next available time.""
 brazil.218.c: ""...after this agreement is finalized.""

 brazil.219.t: "Immediate Action"
 brazil.219.desc: ""But that's beside the point, Herr Salles. The way I see it, the citizens of the Reich must be returned immediately. There will be no room to avoid it, the crews of the trawlers have to come home starting tonight."\n\nSalles instantly knew what to say to Steiner's demand. "That's, um, well impossible Field Marshal. We aren't about to release any prisoners or suspend prosecution without some sort of an agreement in place explaining why it won't happen again. Let alone immediately which would be a huge logistical nightmare?"\n\n"Well, you have their boats, right? Couldn't they sail back?" Steiner laughed at his own joke as he took yet another sip of Gaffel Kölsch. "But really, the Reich cannot tolerate what you are doing. They cannot stand its people being held in your prisons for another day. We want them out tonight."\n\nThis was an interesting situation. Salles could, yet again, accept this deal and leave with a degree of humiliation. Or perhaps he could push for something more... reasonable. There was no reason any extradition couldn't take place at an efficient pace if some time was granted. Perhaps Steiner could see that.\n\nBut he also may not be able to see reason. And then this whole negotiation would be a farce.\n\nSalles read his adversary's face and decided on a course of action."
 brazil.219.a: "Very well, immediate repatriation."
 brazil.219.b: "Perhaps a more achievable timetable?"

 brazil.220.t: "The Art of the Possible"
 brazil.220.desc: ""But that's beside the point, Herr Salles. The way I see it, the citizens of the Reich must be returned at the next available time. What we are asking is not an immediate transfer, but one that is done with as little delay as possible."\n\n"So...that would mean we let the fishermen out of prison in a general pardon," Salles said.\n\n"You must agree that we need to move beyond this unfortunate situation as soon as we can, and that means we transfer them all over," explained Steiner, who then took yet another sip of Gaffel Kölsch. "We would arrange to help you in the matter, with ship and Lufthansa transport of course. We understand this would take time and we are perfectly willing to allow a generous period to get the repatriation in order. However, it must be carried out promptly."\n\nThat did seem like a good deal to Salles. The detainees got to leave pretty quick while it wasn't a total loss on their end. But... "how do we know you aren't going to renege?"\n\n"Huh?" asked Steiner as he was in the middle of a drink.\n\n"This expulsion, how do we know you won't turn around on us? Because that's the only reason you are at the table in the first place. Without your citizens, we lose our leverage."\n\n"You have our promise we won't go back on our verbal agreement," said Steiner, which Salles honestly didn't believe a word of."
 brazil.220.a: "Still sounds like a good compromise."
 brazil.220.b: "We release our prisoners when we want!"

 brazil.221.t: "As You Like It"
 brazil.221.desc: ""But that's beside the point, Herr Salles. The way I see it, the citizens of the Reich must be returned after this agreement is finalized. There isn't a reason to hold them after the issue has been settled. And we don't want them to be in detention any more than absolutely necessary."\n\nSalles thought it over. "That would certainly seem reasonable," he said. "I know the detention of the crews is a big issue with your government, and I wouldn't see any reason to keep holding them after the dispute has been settled."\n\n"I believe that after a proper settlement, we would have worked through the logistical issues of getting them back here. Lufthansa needs some time to get some charter flights ready. And I understand there are some...issues that require further prosecution. It isn't really that Germanic to go attack a group of Brazilian marines with your fists regardless of circumstance."\n\n"So...the only demand is that we allow the detained crews to leave after the deal is signed and not prosecute them for the illegal fishing charge? I'd suppose that would be something the Attorney General might get behind for reasons of, um, diplomatic necessity."\n\n"Excellent! A toast to this agreement!" Steiner held up his half-full glass of Gaffel Kölsch, and Salles returned with water."
 brazil.221.a: "They did say Zentralafrika was the pragmatic one."

 brazil.222.t: "Sense and Sensibility"
 brazil.222.desc: "Now?" asked Salles. "That is far and beyond what we can do. There is no conceivable way that we can possibly release everyone at this moment. Not without proper protocols in place."\n\n"The agreement will be made tonight," Steiner said, "and we will have the issue settled at this very moment. Not until you stop dithering to make it official, legally binding, or whatever the fuck."\n\n"We don't have to wait for an official agreement, but we can't have a blanket pardon go out tonight and have everyone crowd Norddeutscher Lloyd to get back. That would be highly chaotic, just allowing them to leave with no clue how to get back to Africa. They wouldn't stand for it, we wouldn't stand for it, and that might keep the story in the papers long enough for Germania to wake up and take notice of the clown show you have going on here." Salles gestured to the Africans waiting on the Hitlerstadt VIPs.\n\nSteiner gritted his teeth. He regretted not having a lighter beer to drink earlier in the night. "Your point, Herr Salles?"\n\n"We don't need an immediate release, just a simple delay, enough to process out some lingering issues, but still one that would allow efficient and expedient return from South America. Don't you agree?"\n\nNow Steiner had to make a decision about this. And he knew with the drinking and the lateness he was almost not in the state of mind to make the correct one."
 brazil.222.a: "Sure, Walter, we can do that."
 brazil.222.b: "We meant exactly what we said."

 brazil.223.t: "Brazil wants delayed return"
 brazil.223.desc: ""That's not going to happen, Field Marshal, we cannot allow a release before the agreement is done."\n\nSteiner knew this was the wrong time to be buzzed on alcohol. "Herr Salles, the agreement I put before you is a sensible accommodation-"\n\n"I recall Hitler said the same at the Munich conference, but I think you will find the Chamberlains of the world to be quite a rare variety. You have to admit your government isn't the most trustworthy in terms of its diplomatic history. I mean, the wait staff are a fair bit more tan than you put in the brochure even."\n\nSteiner grimaced. "But you cannot hold our people indefinitely after this is settled-"\n\n"Which is why they will be released after the formalization of the agreement. Call that insurance. And it's much better for you and your boss if Germania can't force you to renege on the agreement since we still hold some cards."\n\n"To tell you the truth, Walter, Germania doesn't even care about what we agree to tonight. The Afrikaministerium doesn't respond to anything, Hitler is on the way out and probably knows it, Schenck doesn't give a fuck about this and would ask for too much money anyway, and Hüttig thinks he runs the place for God's sake! We don't have the capacity to go back on our word."\n\n"That's incredibly hard to believe for a system that prides itself on efficiency and ruthlessness."\n\nYou don't know the half of it, thought Steiner as he took a drink. Then he decided how to handle this."
 brazil.223.a: "Alright, you win, delayed return."
 brazil.223.b: "That was as moderate as we could get."

 brazil.224.t: "For All Time"
 brazil.224.desc: ""...and Schenck has some 323s we could borrow, though I think he has some jets that could also work," said Steiner. "We'll have to pay for it, but he can keep Germania out of this and we can get them to Brazzaville in only a few hours."\n\n"Sounds like we have a plan," said Salles, who sighed and relaxed for a moment. "Is there anything else you want to discuss?"\n\n"Nothing comes to mind," Steiner said. Then he had a realization, and a smile broke across his face. "Walter..."\n\nSalles knew what that meant. "Rolf..."\n\nThey shook hands and laughed. "Son of a bitch," said Rolf, "we just avoided a war! A mercenary and a businessman! Who needs Walter Hewel, honestly?"\n\n"I'm sure that you'd do no worse in his place," joked Salles. "Now, we should get this written up to bring to. . .is that a helicopter?"\n\nThe noise of an approaching chopper caused Steiner's heart to sink. Even with his stupor he could tell it was a German-made Lerche II. "Liebe Gott im Himmel, why now?"\n\n"What is it?" asked Salles. "What's going on?"\n\n"What the fuck do you think it means when a hellicopter lands outside your house in this Kommisariat?""
 brazil.224.a: "This is a complication."

This is the Brazilian representative, Herr Walter Morina Salles -"\n\n"Nice to meet you Walter," Müller said as he took out the clip in his G1 rifle and looked into it. "Hey, do we have a deal yet?"\n\nMüller wasn't the typical Reichskommisar in the slightest, Salles realized. He had eschewed the typical NSDAP uniform Kasche and Terboven had worn when he met them, and they also never chambered an automatic rifle after asking a question at him. "Well, yes, Herr Reichskommissar, there has-"\n\n"Splendid! Diplomacy wins again!" He stood up from the helicopter and walked toward Salles, still holding his gun in the air with one hand. "Herr Salles, I want to let you know I regret this terrible incident, and that I had little part in it, acting only on orders from Germania. I am pleased my lieutenant has smoothed over any difficulties between Germany and Brazil, and I wish to show your nation that I hold no ill-will over the incident with a diplomatic visit."\n\nThat was incredibly unexpected. "What?" asked Salles and Steiner simultaneously.\n\n"I always wanted to go to Brazil. All that wild jungle, that Jesus statue, Carmen Miranda, never got a chance. You think we can make it happen Walter?"\n\nSalles thought it over. "I don't see if that would be an issue. Diplomacy is always good, but the Americans would be incredibly angry. But I guess that's for your chief negotiator to decide."\n\nSteiner gulped. Why did it come down to him? Why was he the one who had to decide what to do about this?\n\n"Rolf," asked Müller, "were you drinking tonight?""

 brazil.226.t: "Reichskommissar's Brazilian Expedition Captures Attention of South America"
 brazil.226.desc: "Rio de Janeiro (AP) - The visit of Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller to Brazil has caught the attention and surprise of many around the globe, especially here in the country. Until recently, he was seen as the primary antagonist in the dispute over fishing rights in the South Atlantic and many expected him to be in an armed conflict with the South American nation over it. However, this week he was all smiles as his plane touched down in Rio, greeted by a small delegation of government officials for a short visit to the city.\n\nAny potentially awkward meeting with President Henrique Lott was avoided as Zentralafrika's governor decided to do away with a formal diplomatic visit in favor of a more casual one, where much of his time was spent not in ceremonies in Brasília, the new modernist capitol, but in a helicopter flying over the jungles of the Amazon. "The goal of my journey was to bag a Jaguar, but unfortunately I could not find one," the Reichskommissar said to the local press. "However, I did kill this very large black caiman, and I will bring it home with me to show to my guests in Léopoldville."\n\nThe German Embassy in Brazil said in a statement they hoped this visit would open a new chapter in Brazilian-German relations, but it is believed many in the Nazi government are displeased with the semi-official visit. The State Department was much more open about their displeasure with the visit, blasting Brazil for hosting a major official in the Nazi party. Homegrown opposition was also there, with many groups, predominantly Afro-Brazilian, protesting the visit due to atrocities that are occurring across Germany's colonial holdings. "What this government has done is turn Brazil into a playground for international criminals," declared an editorial in the Tribuna da Imprensa.\n\nMüller, who takes delight in being a more relaxed and atypical Reichskommisar than his other colleagues, was not fazed with such criticism. "All of politics is stupid and you should really ignore it," he said. He also said President Lott or Vice President Jânio Quadros would be welcome to make a reciprocal visit to Zentralafrika at any time."

 brazil.227.t: "Bon Voyage, Herr Salles"
 brazil.227.desc: "The early morning sunlight began to rise over Africa, illuminating the single private jet on the Hitlerstadt tarmac. Outside, the crew were sitting and lounging around, trying to avoid thinking about the worst that could happen in the middle of the vast and hostile pit that was Nazi Africa. But right now, there was nothing to do but ensure the plane was ready to go at a moment's notice.\n\nDown the road, up from the city came the convoy of camouflage cars. They were let into the airport grounds, and they parked in front of the plane. A group of mercenaries got out and formed an impromptu honor guard. This had caused the pilots to perk up. Walter Salles stepped out of the car in the middle, followed by Rolf Steiner. A few words were exchanged, before Salles climbed up the steps and into his jet.\n\nFinally on what was technically home soil after hours of debate, Salles got into a seat and relaxed. The arguments were hard, and the hours were late. He may have given up too much, but the important thing was he had an agreement to stop the Lobster War. They may judge him a Metternich or a Chamberlain, but he had something that would avoid war once and for all. And that had to account for something.\n\nBut as the jet took off and disappeared into the brilliant blue sky above the Congo Lake, Steiner watched intently as the diplomat left. He wasn't so sure of his deal either, and he was a bit drunk towards the end of it. And he knew more than anyone else just how few problems could be solved by resolution in this insane world. However, for a moment, he felt a tinge of relief at the fact he was able to avoid yet another conflict in Africa."
 brazil.227.a: "Peace in our time."

 brazil.228.t: "Sunk Costs"
 brazil.228.desc: "Eventually, everyone realized it would never work.\n\nSalles had expected a violent outburst from the man, but in reality Steiner was a lot more measured about the situation. Perhaps the alcohol had prevented an outburst. Maybe he was more sensible for a mercenary than Salles had assumed. But it also could have been that Steiner simply did not care so much for the lobster or worry about a conflict after all.\n\nNo time was wasted afterwards. Once a deal could not be reached, Steiner escorted Salles back into the motorcade and drove back to the airport. No words were exchanged between the two, as there was no need: everything had already been said. At the airport, Salles bid the host farewell and walked to the waiting jet himself. Steiner just watched from the car.\n\nThis was bad, thought Salles. The Germans weren't reasonable. This trip was the last hope at diplomacy, and it was a complete bust. Now he would have to answer to Lott why things had failed so spectacularly. And that now harder measures would be necessary to solve the crisis.\n\nBut it may have surprised him as he flew into the dark night that Steiner was thinking much the same thing. The whole world was about to fall apart in violence, and now a direct threat worse than Cameroon or South Africa loomed from the west. He knew this was not the end of the Brazilian efforts, not in the slightest."

 brazil.229.t: "The Return of the Nereide"
 brazil.229.desc: "The crew of the Nereide, a trawler operating out of Cabinda, was mostly native crewmen with some Belgian and French senior officers. There was only one German among them. That didn't matter as they were all Zentralafrikans as far as the marines that boarded their ship were concerned. And that meant their boat was impounded, while the crew got to spend their time in a detention facility made out of a former warehouse in the Base Naval Almirante Ary Parreiras in Natal, Brazil.\n\nThe worst parts were the uncertainty and the waiting. They could send letters out, but calls were not possible. An enterprising Brazilian had them do tedious work such as landscaping around the naval base, but that still left a lot of time to loaf around and perhaps practice some Portugese. There were rumors, and the consulate would give them stories every day about how Brazil would pay for their suffering, but that never answered the question about when they could go home.\n\nFinally, they got their answer. They were loaded up, one truckload at a time, and then dropped off at the local airport. There, the sight of a massive Messerschmitt 323 Gigant with the colors of the Südwestafrikan Luftwaffe gave them the greatest sense of relief they had felt since the Brazilian corvette had pulled alongside them.\n\nAfter a fairly uncomfortable trip across the Atlantic, the plane touched down in Brazzaville. As they left, they were happy to be once again in the warm blue skies and humid air of the Congo. It was home at last, and they were free once again.\n\nBut they were nowhere near their home port. They had no ship. Or a good way to get back.\n\nAnd they were still subjects of Nazi Africa."

 brazil.232.desc: "To celebrate his victory, João Goulart decided on a traditional churrasco in his old gaúcho way. Supporters and allies, like Vargas and Kubitschek, came to congratulate him and even had to proclaim a speech or two, drunk as he was. It was a day for celebration, after all. Even when all guests had left and everybody in the house slept, Goulart and Leonel Brizola remained by the fire. The brothers-in-law drank, ate, they laughed, and toasted each other in their slurred words. This was the moment for praise and rejoicing, Brizola said. The next few years would be an uphill struggle against the forces that corrupted Brazilian politics and oppressed Brazilian workers. President João Goulart would lead the labor movement to new heights, Brizola said in a final toast, and the free people of Brazil would see a future of happiness.\n\nFar away from the next President's home, four generals sat in a smoky backroom, a somber atmosphere between them. How could this happen? How could they allow a socialist, a puppet of Vargas, a goddamned communist to govern this country. No, this wouldn't do. Now was the time for reaction.\n\nLater, Getúlio Vargas smoked a fat Cuban cigar in his dark office, with an almost gleeful grin. "Oh, how the generals must be seething right now," he thought. As the smoke filled the room, Vargas remembered his days in power and how hard he fought for the nation. Now, Jango would fight his mentor's battles, and with some assistance, his success would be almost certain."

The whole Urca Casino exploded in cheers as confetti began to fall and the casino band began to play a special, jazzy remix of "Peixe Vivo", Kubitschek's favourite song. It was done; the PTB-PSD coalition had come out on top again, cementing even more its position as Brazil leading political force. JK was lifted up by the eclectic crowd of his supporters, from industrialists to oligarchs, from military men to teachers and commoners invited to take part on the ceremony to cement his victory. They carried him all the way to the podium where he was dropped and stumbled to way into the microphone with his cigarette crumpled by movement. Vargas was among the guests of honour being constantly praised by his disciple, taking part on the cheering at every line of his speech.\n\n"We did it!" whispered Jango, who was sitting to Vargas' right. "I wonder how Lacerda is right now."\n\n"Biting his hat off, as they would say in my time," commented Vargas, causing Jango to laugh. "But we can't leave our guard down. He might try something, he always does."\n\n"And he always fails." finished Jango, who returned his attention to the cheering as Kubitschek went into his plans for the future.\n\nVargas himself though about what that meant, he didn't know if he would be there for the next president's inauguration, but that one marked a major victory. His system continued, having adapted to the ideological needs of the time. Getúlio Dornelles Vargas, once called President and Father of the Poor, had succeeded in making a lasting legacy."

 brazil.234.desc: "Victory! In the UDN's headquarters now elected President Quadros exchanged cheers with staffers, other UDN candidates and friendly journalists. His legs were leaden from fatigue, his gait unsteady by a steady stream of celebration drinks. The thought of making a speech was far from everyone's mind. The evening would see celebration. Better speak the following day when words would no longer be slurred by the new leader of the Republic. For now Quadros exchanged jokes with those present, draining the last of his drinks for the day.\n\nHow far had  he come along! The president reflected, sprawled over a couch. Every opponent on the left had mocked the vice-president's impossible bid for power, the vice-presidency itself initially supposed to be a shackle to future ambitions. With clipped wring, the UDN's cuckoo would strut without flying far, journalists had mockingly proclaimed.\n\nOn the right the crow's partisans had winced at seeing their political party taken over by Quadros. Pushed in the political wilderness by Lacerda's failed coup in the fifties, many ungrateful party members had been dismayed to find Quadros at their head.\n\nAll the doubters would be proven wrong. Janio Quadros closed his eyes a few moments. The excited buzz of the room was as sweet a lullaby as anything he could have hoped for. The next day would see a proper speech for the occasion."

The people of Brazil had chosen the right path at long last!\n\nBreathing a bit hard, he took the record off the needle and wiped his brow. Once he caught his breath, he walked out to greet his staff and most ardent supporters. The cheers washed over him as he waved and smiled magnanimously, shaking hands and greeting old friends with all the dignity that his time as Governor of Guanabara had let him develop. When the crowd began to quiet down, he spoke.\n\n"My friends! Thank you so much for all of your support, all your tireless efforts! Our glorious Republic, so often led astray, has finally glimpsed her dignity and destiny. We will stand as a pillar of liberty and prosperity, a land where the citizens are free to live, work, and pursue happiness without fear of foreign imperialists or domestic tyrants. The ruinous policies of past administrations will be overturned, and the burden on the middle classes throughout the country will be lifted.

One of his suspenders was undone.\n\n"Uh Mr. DeBarros." said the aide with a worried look on his face. "A telephone just came in asking for you. They said it's about the election."\n\nAdhemar chuckled. "Did my lead increase even more?" Adhemar turned to the party. "Okay my friends I have to go take a call. Presidential Business and all."\n\nOne last rousing cheer was given as Adhemar walked into the other room to take the call. He picked up the phone.\n\n"It's Adhemar.What news you have for me. My victory is guaranteed? Well that's great but I don't think that's a reason to- What? Wait wait wait."\n\nThe red drained from Adhemar's face as he immediately began to sober up.\n\n"What do you mean Laudo lost! How the fuck did he lose if I won! Who's ahead? Enda Lott won? It was close? It doesn't matter if he was close he still lost!"\n\nAdhemar began to pace.\n\n"Bloody PTB gunking up everything! We're going to have to completely change plans now! How did this happen? The poll put us ahead by more than 5 points! I won! How the hell did he lose! We are going to have to find a new spot for him in the cabinet or something. I don't know.

Good arguments and baseless insults were brought by both sides, and the UDN was likely to coalesce and support whoever ended up on top of this endless debate.\n\nCarlos Lacerda, currently the governor of Guanabara, was a prominent journalist before taking up the reins of public office.

"How do you feel about getting some fresh air?"\n\nAnd so Vitor was sent to the countryside as part of the commission, to do initial findings and investigate if land reform was needed. A simple task.\n\nBut the sights he encountered made his head reel.\n\nYes, electricity was slowly spreading. Yes, more young people could read. Yes, the richer peasants had old but well-kept cars.\n\nYet the countryside had in many ways barely moved out of the last century. Mayors were so stinking rich that the insides of their houses made Rio's finest apartments look shabby. Caiados still dominated the states and had eyes and ears everywhere - nothing happened in their lands without their permission. And despite years upon years of promise, poverty and the slow, grinding life remained to plague the people.\n\nAs he left the last house of yet another poor peasant, who'd still straightened herself with immense dignity to tell him of her plight, Vitor steeled himself. He was a city man. He had never been in the countryside.

"Ladies and Gentlemen, do not mistake me for one of the countless aristocrats, do not take me for a brutish street thug. Take me as you would a guest. That is all I am, after all." Goulart paused and leaned forward to the crowd. His voice hardened, and his posture snapped into that of a great agitator himself. "Those who steal your grain, those that rob you of your efforts, that make life impossible- those are not guests! They are not welcome! None deserve to have their hard work chiseled into nothing by the moron artisans of the greater powers!" The crowd stood partly confused, angry voices dying off only to listen to who had been sent to quiet them, and stood partly with anger growing back into their souls, their fists, themselves as a whole, as they listened to the lone politician ahead of their protest.\n\n"You have all suffered under the tight yoke of those who have ignored you, trampled you! I have seen it! Even now, I see it! That is why I will not rest, will not sleep until I have passed a bill so strong that even the lowliest thief will pay his local representative to vote against it!"

Yet Jânio and his cabinet insisted that he meet with these ranchers to discuss the most recent agrarian reform bill, which Lott thought was an awful idea.\n\n"Mr President, I heard that you are trying to implement some new reforms regarding my land?" The rancher puffed on his cigar again, blowing smoke directly towards Lott. The gall on this man, to directly disrespect the damn President of the Republic, Lott thought. At least the military had some sort of order to itself, despite their constant meddling in politics.\n\n"Yes, sir. Surely you've heard of the strikes crippling the country, with those unions causing a serious ruckus in the countryside. They've been pushing for this bill; I'm confident there's plenty of room to compromise, though." "I was hoping you'd say that, Mr. President. The reforms reach too far and are aiming to do too much in too little time. Surely you can agree with me that a gradual reform process would be better than strongfisting this communist manure through the Congress?"\n\nLott's hands remained clasped together, and he rested his chin on them while he thought about it. Would Jango be able to continue selling the bill if it was any less effective? How much support could Jânio realistically pull from the UDN and that coward Lacerda? His thoughts continued to race, until another puff of smoke appeared in his face. Waving it off, Lott responded, "I think there's some parts of the bill that could be trimmed back, yes. What exactly did you have in mind?"\n\nThe rancher smiled, and pulled out a surprisingly long list of demands from his back pocket before handing it over. Lott sighed, and began to read off the list. Some of these were absolutely non-starters, but others could maybe make the cut. He would have a hell of a time convincing the PTB to back these, but weaker action was still better than no action, right? Lott looked up, and said:"

Are we here to discuss votes in a chamber, or are we here to improve the lives of our fellow countrymen?" Goulart sighed, and rapped his knuckles along the table. These strikes had been going on for a month, and President Lott had sent him to negotiate with the leaders like some sort of lapdog. Why couldn't that marshal be out here himself; he's the president, and he should be the one responding to his people.\n\n"Paulo, we can have our pipe dream of a free republic later with all of the land reform we could possibly want. It doesn't matter if we cook up the perfect set of reforms only if the entirety of the UDN walks out on us!" "And WHY exactly do we give a rat's ass about the UDN? Those fascists should be locke-". A tall man, named Lucas, raised his hand to interject. "Jango, look," said Lucas, another leader of the strikes, "we have to be able to get something more out of the current bill. What if we gave the banks additional money to issue more loans to protect small farm owners and ensure that the ranchers can't buy them out immediately after we redistribute the land?"\n\n"Lucas, you want to trust the banks to help the poor? Have you absolutely lost it?!" yelled Paulo as his fist slammed the desk.  "No, I have not," Lucas sighed, "Jango is right. We need the UDN. Hell, we don't even know if the PSD will fully support our additional demands. We have to start somewhere."\n\n"Screw you guys. I can't believe I thought you two stood for anything", Paulo muttered as he slammed the door behind him. After an uneasy silence, Goulart coughed awkwardly. "Well, what else is still palatable for the UDN and the PSD?" questioned Lucas. And, for the next four hours, several of Brazil's most prominent labor leaders huddled to try and figure out what they could compromise on.

Before his mind could continue racing in circles, he heard a loud and impatient knock on his door. As Lucas sat up to open the door, he got a glance at several of his fellow union workers; why were they holding pitchforks? Did that one man have a pistol?\n\n"Come on Lucas, we're marching to the capitol building now. Are you in? Allende's supposed to meet us there." a fellow union worker questioned. Lucas really didn't like how belligerent his fellow protestors seemed to be, but he had no choice. If he didn't protest this grand injustice now, did he even have any beliefs or standards left? "Yea, I'll be out in a second."\n\nHalfway across the country, Lott stared at his telephone with unease, trying to avoid a phone call with his former colleagues. He had a migraine after reading about all the reports of the angry peasants and laborers regarding the failure of the Agrarian Relief Act. It wasn't his fault; damn Lacerda and his UDN cronies. The bill was going to make Brazil stronger, and why couldn't they see past their shortsighted views? Surely they were getting bankrolled by those very ranchers, Lott thought. Before he could pick up another report, his phone began to ring.\n\n"President Lott? This is Denys. You know what I'm going to ask of you." Lott gulped, "Of course," he said with a shaky voice. "Do you think it's truly necessary?"\n\n"Henrique, they're burning down property and attacking police forces. I've had more requests from the police across the country for the military to support them than there are damn mosquitos in this country. We either do something now, or we risk a leftist revolt." Lott couldn't even begin to think of the consequences before his mouth moved on its own.\n\n"Denys, do what you and the military need to do. Just try to keep the violenc-", Lott said to himself as an idle tone began. That jingle had never felt so humiliating until now for the President of Brazil."

 brazil.253.t: "The Dockworkers Strike"
 brazil.253.desc: "The brief on Lott's desk painted a bleak picture for the dockworkers. Each man received as monthly payment a stack of cruzeiro banknotes thinner than their abraded bootsoles. Nearly every day at work was punctuated by a disabling accident, and the supervisors were rarely there to see it. "It's depressing, isn't it, Mr President?" Quadros said, breathing out blue smoke. "I'd strike, too. I'd go down there if I could, as well, but then the only difference between me and them would be that I'd want to be there."\n\nLott pushed the papers to the edge of his desk. "Am I meant to infer that it won't go on for long, Jânio? We could cut it short if we sent in the police."\n\n"I'm saying this has become normal. If those workers have been putting up with it for years, they probably can't afford to miss the pay, so we should take the time to find out what pushed them too far and fix it."\n\nLott glanced at Denys - the ageing marshal – and gestured calmly at his old military accomplice. "The owners don't want police because they think they'd panic their shareholders, but we have no reason to get involved, either, Mr President. If the negotiations go poorly, the fallout will rest on you. Please keep in mind that it's a squabble between employees and employers, it's not our problem unless we make it our problem."\n\nQuadros glided across the office to loom over Denys, who fit neatly within his shadow. "Defence, then - that's your field. How will we make ships if there's no-one there to build them? That sounds like our business. You should be on my side, Denys, you might have a stake in this farce."\n\n"That's enough from both of you." Lott said. "I'll decide shortly. For now, you're dismissed." Denys and Quadros both hurried out of the office - Denys insofar as he could - and left the President at his desk, looking out in deep thought over the calm waters of Lago Paranoá."
 brazil.253.a: "Soldiers fight uncertain battles all the time, but never by choice. It's not my fight."

 brazil.254.t: "Lott Refuses to Intervene"
 brazil.254.desc: "The brief on Lott's desk painted a depressing picture for him. The President's inaction meant nothing for the companies, who had agreed to some of the strikers' demands, but it had isolated him. Lacerda's ministrations had diminished his support from the PSD's right; the worm had been haranguing the people through platform speeches about how Lott had betrayed business, how he could not be trusted to replenish Brazil's economy, or a poor man's purse.\n\nIt annoyed him, this was no place for the President to interfere between a private business and its workers.\n\nAccompanied by the creaking of wood, Jânio Quadros intruded upon the quiet. The thin man's shadow stretched from the doorframe to Lott's desk. To the President, he seemed as an itinerant preacher - a Jehovah's Witness of the political sphere, and patently unwelcome. "Mr President, you have your office because the people trusted you with its power, why not use it?"\n\n"I don't appreciate that you've come to my office just to regurgitate Lacerda's hyperbole. Please leave."\n\nQuadros made no sound when he crossed the floor. His glasses framed his glower like a second set of eyebrows. He spoke calmly. "Looking past the damage you've done to yourself, that you think I'm here to speak for Lacerda is wrong. Those miners could have gone home to their families singing about their victory and voting for both of us, if you had just given it to them."\n\nLott, looking up, locked eyes with Quadros. The President's gaze was calm and severe, and a long moment passed."Quadros as I have said before, I do not appreciate your comments at this time, please leave."\n\nQuadros scoffed. On his way out, he pounded the door and a loose screw fell to the marble flooring. Lott attentively listened to Quadros' footsteps grow more distant."
 brazil.254.a: "It was none of my business."

 brazil.255.t: "Negotiating with the Dockworkers"
 brazil.255.desc: "The air in the room was dense with cigar smoke and perspiration and Lott finally understood how the dockworkers felt stuffed into the hull of a ship. Perhaps that was part of their strategy. Twenty men on either side of the dispute sat around a sticky table which occupied most of the room, and the President was crammed into a thatch chair at its end. The dockworkers chewed tobacco and talked among themselves a bit before a gaunt man emerged from their number and hushed them - the strike leader. "Before we begin, I'd like to thank the President for coming. Especially given the opposition he must have experienced before he took the long journey here." Lott nodded as men around the table puffed their cigars and the room was filled with smoke.\n\n"Well, we have every reason to listen to each other, now, Mr President. I'll be blunt, we'd prefer it if you heard us over our bosses. We want a ten per cent raise to our pensions and a six per cent raise to our minimum wage. If we agree on this, the strike will stop by tomorrow morning."\n\nLott did not let his face betray his doubt. Those numbers threatened his government's coffers, but they might not be as costly as the fury of the oligarchs. Simultaneously, he was unsure how long the strike could drag on. How much the action would cost him, and how much it would cost the dockworkers, was like rolling dice, but if he haggled skillfully he might be able to contain his expenses. Or, perhaps, Lott could win this game by not playing...\n\nAnd yet there was a feeling he could not evade, Respect. Behind these men with calloused hands were families who depended on them. Their strike was not selfish or risk-free, and he could send them all home to happy families if he opened his wallet."
 brazil.255.a: ""I don't see you retreating from this anytime soon and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'll meet your demands.""
 brazil.255.b: ""Ten, six per cent, that's far too steep. Those numbers will need to come down before I can agree to anything..""
 brazil.255.c: "You choke me on your cheap cigars for this? The President will not be swayed by high numbers and pleading eyes. Goodbye!"

 brazil.256.t: "Lott Kowtows in Negotiations"
 brazil.256.desc: "The strike leader nearly jumped halfway along the table to seal their agreement. He and Lott shook hands and opened the door to heavy, humid air. The dockworkers, joyous but bemused at their complete, swift victory eyed the President through their beer as he left.\n\nThe only sounds in the Presidential Palace were the tappings of Lott's footsteps. Quiet like this was always a prelude to argument, and he knew someone was waiting in ambush in his secretary's adjunct office, which he strode into. There, in a unique incident of reliability, Tancredo Neves blocked the door to Lott's view of Lago Paranoá.\n\n"Mr President, what persuaded you to open our treasury to those workers?"\n\n"Good afternoon, Neves. I'm assured it was the quickest way to resolve the dispute and get them working again."\n\n"And an excellent way to undermine investor confidence and induce economic confusion. Those assurances weren't from Denys, I'm certain of that."\n\n"It was a decision I made, not Quadros, and if a little confusion is a consequence of something that must happen, then it's better we resolve it sooner. And now, I have a similar problem. I need to find the quickest way to get you out of the way to my office."\n\nWith a weathered frown, Neves opened Lott's door and the President sat in his chair. "I made no mention of Quadros, nor do I need to for you to realise that he may be making those decisions soon. Those dockworkers didn't see you negotiating with them, they saw Quadros pushing you into a chair. He didn't need to be at the meeting to profit from it. Be careful, Mr President, and have a good day.""
 brazil.256.a: "And with the click of a latch, Lott's office was silent."

 brazil.257.t: "Driving a Hard Bargain"
 brazil.257.desc: ""I understand how difficult your work is, but mine requires I make some difficult decisions. You are asking for too much, and I can't agree to anything until those numbers come down."\n\nThe strike leader's fingers rapped against the table. He traded whispers with the other workers before he spoke. "Maybe you do understand, Mr President, but maybe you don't. You're a soldier, I don't know if you've ever been in a battle, but the feeling you get in your chest after being flung around by a shell is what some of these guys live all the time. Some of the men here are pushing into their fifties and walk like their back's been kicked in for years, because that's how it's been."\n\n"With all due respect, fighting a battle and carrying luggage are two very different things. I know soldiers without legs who wish they could walk like some of you do, but they can't."\n\nAmid the percussive demurral of the dockworkers, the strike leader's face twisted into a scowl, the sweat on his forehead falling into its deep creases. "Mr President, the smoke we're breathing right now is like fresh morning air next to the shit from the engines our bosses stick us near. The closest thing to it is a soldier sucking up mustard gas, and they at least get their pension! It's that or the wage, Mr President, take it or leave it."\n\nBehind his severe expression, Lott chastised himself. He wondered if it would have been a better decision to send Quadros to negotiate, or to have spent the day planning the Trans-Amazonian Highway by the cool air of  Lago Paranoá. Regardless, he thought, these dockworkers won't go home empty-handed..."
 brazil.257.a: "Your terms are unacceptable, I'm out"
 brazil.257.b: "Porting is back-breaking work, the least I can do is make sure you can afford a comfy chair when you retire. You'll have your pension."

 brazil.258.t: "Lott Leaves the Meeting"
 brazil.258.desc: "He would not stand for this.\n\nLott threw his chair back, wedging it against the wall, and strode for the exit. The dockworkers watched in silent awe as he turned his back on them. The scent of fresh air relieved the President, and he slammed the door on the workers' hurried protestations.\n"What are you doing?"\n"Get back here!"\n"Lott, you bastard! We'll do this without you!"\n\nThey did it without him.\n\nLott flicked through the newspaper to the full story on page twenty-three, skipping his best-loved World section. The dock owners had conceded to both demands, and the agreement had been sealed with a tense handshake, neatly photographed, featuring the inexorable strike leader. Lott mulled over the article with a unreadable look. Though, he thought, it was certainly a victory for the strikers, it was an inevitable one, a necessary adaptation consequent of the modern business climate.\n\nThe President, still with a neutral expression, cut the article out and stuck it in his drawer."
 brazil.258.a: "A nice token of how everything turned out okay"

 brazil.259.t: "Agreeing to Raise Pensions"
 brazil.259.desc: "The strike leader nearly jumped halfway along the table to seal their agreement. He and Lott shook hands and opened the door to heavy, humid air. The dockworkers, assuaged by a higher pension, eyed the President through their beer as he left.\n\nThe ticking of Tancredo Neves' Piaget Calibre 12P invaded Lott's office. For such a small man, and such a small watch, the noise hardly seemed appropriate, but the wealthy politician's voice cut through the mechanical beat. "Mr President, I don't think your recent decisions have been financially sound. The money those dockworkers will get comes from our coffers, whose diminishing contents are made only remotely imposing by the thread the budget will hang on if spending of this kind continues.\n\nLott returned his gaze to the maps on his desk."Thank you for your concern, Neves, but I trust the people at the treasury to omit any offending sums and put in the right ones.\n\n"Quadros won't need to look because everyone in this palace knows what you agreed to. He'd just think of it as an insult.\n\n"I don't mind if Quadros knows and I don't mind if he complains. The omissions wouldn't be for him, anyway.""
 brazil.259.a: "That's all I'll hear of it. You are dismissed, Neves."

 brazil.260.t: "Agreeing to Raise the Minimum Wage"
 brazil.260.desc: "The strike leader nearly jumped halfway along the table to seal their agreement. He and Lott shook hands and opened the door to heavy, humid air. The dockworkers, satisfied with a higher wage, eyed the President through their beer as he left.\n\nMore reports. More letters, most refusing to neglect profanity, from the less surreptitious members of Brazil's business community. Lott considered throwing them out of his window, but the possibility of an overambitious temp discovering them kept his hand on his temple.\n\nDespite his frustration at the striking dockworkers, at least, Lott thought, they knew how to be satisfied. These suits complaining over lost profits would hardly spare him thanks if he bludgeoned them with a pillowcase full of coins. Lott had solved their problem; the dockworkers were back at work and the businessmen were no longer bleeding money.\n\nAnd Lott did not have to pay a cent."
 brazil.260.a: "Maybe I should go into business."

 brazil.261.t: "Father and Daughter"
 brazil.261.desc: "It was a pleasant day in the Palácio de Planalto, and Henrique Teixeira Lott was pleased that he was able to use this good day to meet with someone who was neither an opponent of his, nor somebody who had just messed up, nor indeed somebody out to see what they could get from him. Quite the contrary, it was his beloved daughter Edna, who had just been elected to the Câmara dos Deputados as a member of the PTB. Lott sometimes joked quietly with his daughter about the fact that she'd chosen a different party from him, but since it was Jango's lot, he was completely fine with the situation.\n\n"How are things going then, Edna?"\n\n"Oh, pretty good, dad. I've been getting used to the way things work over at the Deputados. Jango's been showing me the ropes, and I've been in touch with Tancredo here and there."\n\n"Really? Good, glad to hear that. You can trust the two of them. What's your newest project, by the way? I'll see if I can help out with it."\n\n"Oh, I was looking to strengthen protections for women in the urban workforce; I'm sure you've heard about all those workplace accidents in São Paulo and Rio and whatnot where men get what they need but women aren't given a jot as much."\n\n"Ah, that's a good idea, quite good. You'll want to get hold of Leonel Brizola to help you with that, especially seeing as how that jackdaw in Rio will likely screech at the top of his lungs at the prospect."\n\n"Senhor Brizola? That's a good idea, I'd forgotten about him. Thanks, dad."\n\nAs the conversation continued along less urgent matters, Lott relaxed. He was proud of his daughter already; God willing she would give him yet more reason to be proud as the years wore on."
 brazil.261.a: "Edna has a lot of potential, I daresay."

 brazil.262.t: "The Matter of the PSD"
 brazil.262.desc: "Tancredo Neves walked into the office of his friend and colleague, the President of Brazil, Henrique Lott, in the Palácio do Planalto. But today was not a time for socializing or catching up with Lott; no, there were far more important things to deal with. The PSD was roiling with discontent, and something had to be done about it. As Neves came into the room where his boss worked, he said, "Party-political matters"; the ever-present civil servants nodded and left the room.\n\nLott looked up and nodded with a smile on his face. "Tancredo, what brings you here today?"\n\nNeves smiled back, but his face became solemn as he began to speak; his friend noticed this. "Henrique, it's the PSD. The conservatives - Auro and what have you."\n\n"What's the issue with them?"\n\n"The rightists in the PSD are angry, Henrique. They think you've bent too much to Goulart and Quadros, the miner's crisis is a case in point. They are angry that you didn't do enough to consult with them, and for all that I don't like some of them, they're right. You need to do more about their opinions, Henrique."\n\nLott scoffed. "I am President, Tancredo; I am doing what is best for the country. They need to have faith that I will be able to preserve our democracy and prevent a political disaster."\n\nNeves sighed. "I understand that, Henrique; you know I have faith in you. But you really, really need to talk to Auro Andrade and the rest of them. You owe it to them to ensure their voices are heard."\n\nLott made a show of listening, but there was still a stubborn look on his face."
 brazil.262.a: "Neves could tell that clearly, and it worried him."

 brazil.263.t: "A Queda"
 brazil.263.desc: "As the news came out of "Germania", the so-called "Capital of the World", that Adolf Hitler. the Führer of the Nazi empire and self-proclaimed "Master of Europe", had at least suffered the fate of all flesh, many people of the Republic of Brazil joined people throughout the planet to celebrate the demise of a man whose existence had blighted the entirety of humanity.\n\nOne of these was the Governor of Guanabara, Carlos Lacerda. While he was extremely restrained in his glee in public, the moment he was sure he was alone he started yelping and shouting in joy. In fact, he ran around in glee for a few seconds before catching himself and sitting down to write a long polemic denouncing Hitler, everything he stood for, and the devil that he was.\n\nVice-President Jânio Quadros celebrated the situation the only way he knew how, by getting drunk. On the other hand, Juscelino Kubitschek celebrated this development in the company of one of his mistresses. People like Henrique Lott, on the other hand, were more restrained, simply breaking out the champagne or setting out a special meal. Getúlio Vargas was quietly pleased; while Hitler's precious Thousand-Year Reich was collapsing, all that Vargas had left behind for his successors still prospered.\n\nBut, amidst all the celebration, there was one man who was sad about the demise of Hitler. This was Brazil's local fascist specimen, Wilson Leite Passos. While Lacerda, having typed out page after page of antifascist diatribes, replaced his typewriter ribbon, Wilson went to the German embassy to express his condolences. His was the only name in the entire book that was not that of an ethnic German. While others, suffused with glee, said to each other that perhaps the Nazi tyranny might finally begin to fall, Wilson had only one thing to say about the whole thing when asked about it."

 brazil.264.t: "A Reich Divided"

Minister of defence Odlio Denys, a former colleague of Lott during his military days, exposed what was known of the recently begun German Civil War.\n\nDespite Hitler's choice of heir, various elements of the Wehrmacht and German SS had rallied to other pretenders. Germany was predicted to see heavy fighting for a few months. Reichskomissariat Ostland had also exploded into a similar civil war. No words on how other regions of the empire were doing, especially in Eastern Europe.\n\n"Troubling,", the president said at the end of the presentation. "Not much that can be done, but observe the Germans' hubris undo them."\n\n"President, what about the situation in Africa?" Asked Vice-President Quadros, somber for once. "The stress of reduced supplies might see the Reichskomissariats do something drastic. In particular the fanatical Huttig in Ostafrika is likely to be in a dire situation."\n\nPresident Lott nodded approvingly at Quadros heretofore unseen appreciation of military affairs. "Good observation, Mr. Quadros. It's certain that Huttig's one callous son of a bitch, and he'll feel the heat from reduced supplies. But I wouldn't worry about it too much. Sensing weakness, the locals will increase their attack on Huttig especially hard, especially as guns smuggled in from South Africa add to his woes. I give those three reichskommissar a few months before collapse."\n\n"Seems about right Mr President." said the defense minister."

 brazil.265.desc: "Adhemar de Barros, Governor of São Paulo, was out and about, as was his wont. This time he was visiting the São Paulo Zoo, where the Sphere had so very graciously sent a few pandas to form a new enclosure. As the news of it spread throughout the province, countless people came in from all parts of São Paulo and the associated hinterlands to see the strange bear-like creatures.\n\nOf course this was a perfect opportunity for Adhemar - he had learned from hard-won, "honestly"-gained experience that glad-handing with the common people at events like these was the perfect method to gain more support. All the more when it was at an event that Adhemar himself had set up. For he had arranged everything; none of this would have occurred without his work. He planned to make that very clear to the people that approached him.\n\nAs Adhemar walked around and charmed the guests of the zoo with his flamboyant, engaging style, making sure everyone had at least a foggy idea of where their bread was buttered, another matter was making the rounds of his mind. The time was coming for him and Carlos Lacerda to get to work on the little plan they had come up with, and Adhemar was hammering out how best to make sure that the scenario would play out in his favor and leave him in his God-given rightful place as President of Brazil.\n\nAdhemar might have been in the habit of calling on the favor of God so often as to make the ears of every archangel, angel, throne, dominion, and saint ring a hundred times over. But he knew very well that he couldn't expect his Maker to do all the work. With that in mind, he turned towards Carlos Lacerda, who he could see at the entrance of the zoo, and put on his best smile."

 brazil.271.desc: "It had taken hours of driving and then hours of marching for João Amazonas to reach his destination. Flies and insects buzzed all around him, it was almost constantly raining. The politicians were corrupt and there was little to no infrastructure. In other words, it would be the perfect starting-place for the revolution.\n\nNo one would ask any questions about what Amazonas was building here. The thick forest canopy meant they were protected from aircraft; he could get used to the flies. He stood back and watched a number of his comrades get to work, lifting and transporting boxes, cleaning their weaponry and ensuring tents were set up. It had taken them weeks of travelling and searching to pinpoint this very location. But when they had found it, they realized it was perfect.\n\nToo long he had been in the cities, arguing pointlessly with revisionists on minor policy and dealing with schisms in the communist movement due to blind faith in past leaders' methods. How could those fools not see that the past leaders of the movement had all failed because they were not committed enough - that they had compromised too much? Prestes - the revisionist traitor! - was the biggest disappointment of them all. He had been fooled by the social fascism of Vargas and the PTB, despite fighting against Vargas in the 1935 revolution. That accursed revolution whose consequences saw his wife Olga be deported to Germany and caused her to face almost certain death in the slave mines. Amazonas spat onto the floor thinking about this. Once, he had believed in Prestes. But there was an old saying, "Never meet your heroes", and Amazonas certainly regretted meeting him.\n\nAmazonas went back to thinking about the eventual aims of this camp. He planned for a revolution that started in the countryside with the support of the peasantry and would quickly spread to the cities. Of course the revolution would not be built overnight. They needed more arms, more money, more personnel, more everything really. But he and his comrades were committed. Revolutions had succeeded in the past despite dire circumstances; in Brazil it would succeed as well. No longer would Brazil be oppressed; no, Brazil would soon truly be free."

Carpet had been vacuumed, the desk had been dusted, windows had been scrubbed to a spotless standard. All in front of a few friendly journalists. The new government would be freed from corruption, from dirty dealings and from Henrique Teixeira Lott's contempt for the good order of things.\n\nOnce the journalists had departed and his staffers had carried the brooms and bottles of chemicals away, Quadros sat at his bureau for the first time. Beyond the doors, the presidential palace hummed with its habitual energy. The president could not help but think of all the times he had entered the room to find Lott busy. His rival had been a hardworking man, if nothing else. Had it only been a few weeks? Far too early for nostalgia for a simpler time. And of course it would never be time for regret. Lott's corruption had left him unfit for the presidency.\n\nQuadros took a final smell of the fresh office. The smell of something approximating a lemon, seen through a chemist's perspective, tickled his nostrils. Perhaps look for a better brand of cleaning product. There would be ample time to do that. The president took out a manilla folder from his bag. Typewritten on it were the words INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY.\n\nIt was time to get to work."

He had hoped that Quadros was not influential enough to counteract Auro and Carlos Lacerda's plot to get rid of him. Fortunately, that was the case. Quadros was nowhere to be seen, and so the Senate was successfully convinced to direct Quadros to resign.\n\nQuadros, Lacerda had heard, only found out about it when it was too late to stop it; he called for the people to protest what had happened to him, and no-one was forthcoming.\n\nThe last Lacerda had heard about him was that he left for his home with a look of vague despair on his face and none of his usual wild energy.\n\nLacerda realized that this meant he had a shot at the presidency. He shouted in joy and swigged a glass of whisky. Then, calming down, he sat down and turned to face a corkboard he had kept with him from his days as a young leftist journalist. He crossed a photo out and took it down, smirking."

 brazil.277.desc: "Protestors were thronging the streets of São Paulo to demand a response to the corruption and embezzlement on the Trans-Amazonian Highway that had recently been revealed in the newspapers. But today, they were surprised to hear that Brazil was without a president - Lott, that good-for-nothing, who had sat around and done nothing about the corruption, was gone, having issued his resignation that morning. To the protestors, this was a welcome development; however, they still kept on protesting, not wanting to let up until something changed.\n\nOne group of protestors in the middle of Doctor Vieira da Carvalho Avenue was joined by another fellow waving a newspaper. "Hey, guys, the Vice President - that lunatic, Quadros - just resigned!"\n\nPeople looked at each other bemusedly, with no small amount of confusion. A protestor asked his fellows, "If the both of them are gone, what's the point of protesting? Maybe we should just go home."\n\nAnother protestor shook his head. "No, we have to make our voices heard. Even if they have left, even if the road project collapses, the corruption will still be there. Besides, whatever idiot comes in will probably be just as dirty as the last two.""

By rights, it was the turn of that damned pinko João Goulart as Speaker of the Câmara dos Deputados to take over as President. But one thing that the damn fool hadn't remembered before running off to the south to watch a football game was that Auro hated him, and would do anything to keep him out of power.\n\n"Deputies of the Senado!\n\nThe situation is grave. By rights, the honorable João Goulart, President of the Câmara dos Deputados, should assume the fallen mantle of President. But I have determined after consultation with the appropriate authorities" - "this means me, myself and I," Auro muttered under his breath - "that constitutional abnormalities prevent him from taking power at this time and it must go to a free vote of the Senado."\n\nAs the Senado Federal fell into chaos, Auro glanced as subtly as he could at Lacerda, who nodded back as subtly as he was able."

 brazil.279.desc: "João Goulart, the rightful President of Brazil, was caught off guard by the beginning of the Hundred Days' Crisis. He had been in a stadium in the South, watching a football game in person the way all proper Brazilians should do at least once a year. But that left him unprepared for the fall of Lott and Quadros within twenty-four hours of each other, and even less prepared for Auro de Moura Andrade to make his rubbish excuse about constitutional irregularities preventing him from becoming President.\n\nWhen Goulart went to the local airport, he found to his horror that there were emergency training exercises being undertaken by the military, and all planes had been grounded. Knowing that if he pushed it any further he'd probably get arrested, he decided to get hold of a man he could trust.\n\n"Jango, my friend! What's going on? I thought you'd be in Brasília right about now!"\n\n"Nothing so easy, Leonel; I was watching a football game and then the next thing I know the Marshal and Quadros are both out, and that bastard Auro has shut me out of the Presidency! Then the thrice-damned army shuts the airport down. If I were the Crow, I'd probably think it was a conspiracy."\n\n"Whatever happens, Jango, you have to remain calm. Come down to Porto Alegre then and we'll take it from there."\n\nGoulart agreed and hung up, then muttered a prayer under his breath to calm himself. This could be the end. He would need to be very careful about what he did next."

You'll have to take over for me and head to Brasília to press my case."\n\nLeonel Brizola looked at his brother-in-law and nodded, then reached out to embrace him. "Don't worry, Jango, I'll see it done. We'll see you in the Planalto yet, just you wait."\n\nUnlike Goulart, no one dared block the Governor of Rio Grande do Sul from heading north. So it was nothing difficult for Brizola to head to Brasília to stump on Jango's behalf.\n\nWhen he made it there, he announced his presence to the local newspapers and radio stations, denouncing Auro de Moura Andrade's duplicity and making clear his intent to see Goulart enter the Planalto Palace as the next President. The PSD was divided on whether this was a good thing, but the PTB was unambiguously happy to see the return of hope for Jango's campaign. UDN members, on the other hand, mainly gnashed their teeth."

When the news came through that the drunkard Quadros, whose stupidity had set all of this off, had followed him, he was gleeful, but he had no illusions about what this might lead to.\n\nThen Kubitschek heard that Auro de Moura Andrade - that traitor to the PSD, that betrayer of Vargas' ideals! - had spewed some nonsense about "constitutional irregularities" to shut Goulart out of power, and then worse yet that that good-for-nothing barrack-dwelling mouth-breather Frota had threatened to topple democracy if they did not come up with a successor in one-hundred days. At that moment, Kubitschek saw his worst fears come to reality and flew into a rage.\n\nWhen he calmed down, he called Tancredo Neves, who was also quite displeased with everything that had gone down. The two of them concluded that there was only one thing for it - Kubitschek had to go to Brasília. So he did. That very hour in fact. He shoved everything he needed into a bag, bade his wife and family a hasty farewell, and drove as fast as he could up the roads to the capital. It would not be too difficult to make it there on time, he knew."

The modernist building, the pearl of Kubitschek's new national capital, had not seen the man behind its creation in a few years now. President Lott certainly wondered how long this situation would last.\n\nPresident and former president walked in front of the house in the wee hours of the morning. Both men were early risers. As such Lott was never too surprised at a matinal visit from his ally. Even if that morning's conversation had turned acrimonious. The originator of the nation's new capital, Juscelino Kubitschek had an architect's eye. In an ideal world, the former president would leave very little of the political arena to chance.\n\n"You can't simply brush off these industrialists! Especially not when the PSD needs their support to maintain its electoral lead."\n\n"What did I do to irritate them, JK? Tell them they should lower their prices? That the average Brazilian can't afford a car? They know that already."\n\n"You..." Kubitschek finally went quiet, to Lott's delight. All the best to enjoy an early morning walk. Both men paced around the courtyard, bodyguards trailing them. Beyond the courtyard, the new capital started to drift awake, ending another night of soon forgotten dreams. Finally, Lott was first to break the silence.\n\n"Things are well, JK. Things will remain well. The PSD's in a good place. You've ensured it is. You worry too much. As long as we put in the work, the people will reward us."\n\nKubitschek nodded, grimly. He shook Lott's hand, and began to head away. The rising sun cast long shadows on the departing figure."

The crisis was settled, it no longer distracted him from his work, nor the tentative passion project laid out in front of him.\n\nThe lines bisecting the Amazon Jungle would be the arteries of future Brazilian land development. Five thousand kilometres of paved highways would galvanise investment and accelerate the exchange of the nation's goods. Thousands of settlements would be freed from their internment by the jungle's açaizeiros and see visitors arrive by road for the first time in their history. The Amazon would remain a prodigious network of unpaved paths and endless canopy, but it would no longer be the excluded other, for Brazil would be brought to it.\n\nLott smiled. He skimmed a report on truant labourers holding up progress in Ceará and placed it at the bottom of a thick pile of papers. No, no, he'd get back to that later."

"And it's certainly better than us being forced to eat Blutwurst."\n\nGordon took another bite of Moqueca as he thought about the entirely different food they were discussing. "I suppose so, Mister President. And now with Brazil moving towards the OFN, you won't have to worry about fascist incursions anytime soon. I think few understand outside of the diplomatic circles how massive of a development this is. Almost certainly Brazil is going to be one of the premier members of the Organization."\n\n"That is correct, Ambassador, but Brazil has more grand diplomatic ideas than to attend a few training classes and export equipment abroad."\n\n"Diplomatic...how?"\n\n"Mister Gordon, I'm not content with ensuring Brazil never again falls to extremism. Make no mistake, this nation isn't unique in its troubled past and flirtations with authoritarianism. And Brazil isn't going to stand idly back and be content with whatever transpires in the rest of South America. Washington may consider this safe territory, but we know it isn't. And Brazil is going to keep fighting against totalitarianism wherever it develops on the continent. There won't be a Reichskommisariat in South America on my watch. Nor will we have a Manchukuo. We will have a united bloc in the free world that will permanently keep out the Germans from encroaching on us."\n\nLacerda took a bite.

But his daughter Edna, a more moderate Varguist but not moderate enough to form part of her father's party, remained in the fray. In fact, she was still fighting the good fight in Brasília's Câmara dos Deputados to ensure that João Goulart attained his rightful place as president of the Republic. Now the two had met for the first time and, far from engaging in mere small-talk, were discussing what the next steps were.\n\n"Well, Edna, we will have to hit them in this direction, attempting to usurp the rightful succesion of Goulart as set out in the constitution."\n\n"That makes sense, Leonel. I also know a few people I can pressure, many members of the PSD are reasonable and I can reach out to Neves if we need to."\n\nAs the discussion wore on, Brizola and Lott found they disagreed on a few things - namely, the direction Goulart should take when he took power - but agreed on much more important things, such as the need to protect the Varguist and constitutionalist order in the Republic of Brazil. As the day wore on and became evening, and as Lott and Brizola made more progress in discussing the matter at hand, one thought took more and more precedence in their minds:"

Henrique Lott's self-confidence and determination had long given him an iron aura. Nowadays, however, the aura was dented. A warship sputtering into the harbor after a disastrous battle. Yet Lott was not sunk yet. The old general marched on.\n\nThe assembled young officers were of the generation that grew in the shadow of Vargas' regime. To many of them, the army's moment of glory was its ousting of the tyrannical president. The hundred days left them dismayed. Had the army not overreached beyond its constitutional bounds?\n\nDisgraced as he was politically, Lott still held respect in the military. Many did not believe the accusations of corruption. Among the young officers the former president was still personally popular. And while his star had dimmed, it still shone bright. Lott exhorted the young officers to stay true to the republic, to reject the Sorbonne's attempts to unseat the constitutional order.\n\nThe speech over, Lott took many questions from the assembled officer. He did not shy from any topic, nor did he try to provide excuses. He had proven himself unworthy of the presidency, and had thus resigned. A soldier's lot in life was to follow orders, whether from his superior or from providence itself. Pride had no role to play in any of this.\n\n"Having failed in my obligations, I turn to our youth. To you. If I Must crawl and beg for your generation not to repeat my own's mistakes, then so be it." Concluded the old general."

Kubitschek couldn't run now. Not with this particular session of congress being televised by the press.\n\nLacerda stood up and looked at Kubitschek. It was time to attack. "Mr. Kubitschek!" he exclaimed, " You see yourself as being fit for Brazil's leadership. But you are not fit to run a car! Your policies would continue to drive our glorious country to ruin!"\n\nKubitschek looked at Lacerda and slowly stood up. "Mr. Lucerda, let me affirm that I am a believer of Brazilian democracy, and all that it stands for. But unlike you, I believe in building that democracy up. Now is not the time to pointlessly attack each other, but to build up from the foundation that we have."\n\nLacerda sneered, "By pointlessly attacking each other you mean we should instead rush you back into power, where you believe you rightfully belong. And you claim to want to build up from the foundation we have? How can we possibly build up when that very foundation is under attack from abroad, while you do nothing to confront this threat!"\n\n"The Brazilian people must remain unified during this tough time. Your anti-totalitarian crusade will be nothing but a waste of time and resources."\n\n"Is protecting our values a waste of resources?", Lacerda retorted.\n\n"Unprovoked attacks on our own people is a waste of resources." Kubitschek turned to the Press watching the debate.

Goulart stepped out of the car with some of his bodyguards and his aides and began to smile and wave.\n\n"The people have come out to see me," said Goulart, turning to his aides,"So I am going out to see them." Goulart began to walk into the crowd, shaking hands and greeting people.\n\nThe energy surrounding Goulart was electric. The crowd pulsated and moved around him, trying to say something to Goulart, or even get a good look at his face. Hundreds of words were being said, so many that they all blended together into a roar of voices. Goulart walked among the people, saying hello and shaking people's hands,while his bodyguards struggled through the crowds behind him.\n\nGoulart was surrounded by a swarm of people while trying to work his way into the building. BAM! Goulart was pushed to the ground by someone he couldn't see. Screams began to erupt from the crowd. People began to panic. Goulart felt himself being pulled back up. In his dazed confusion he looked backed to see one of his bodyguards shielding him with his body. He could hear someone yelling to ask where the gunshots were coming from over the shouts of the crowd. People began to stampede away. Goulart looked back at the crowd one more time before being thrown back into his car. The car door was slammed shut and his car began to speed away.\n\n"Sir, are you alright?" asked one of his bodyguards.\n\n"I'm alright," said Goulart, "A little shaken but I'm okay."

Article 233 of the Civil Code says that the private property of married women is completely controlled by their husband. That is urgent to half the population.

"So Sarrah, how have the children been doing since I've been gone?"\n\n"They have been good." replied Sarah. "They've missed you though. I've missed you."\n\nJuscelino shifted uncomfortably. He tried to keep his composure. " I know I haven't been around a lot. And I know it has been hard on you and the kids. I would never wish that on you. But, I have responsibilities to Brazil. The people have entrusted me with the most important seat in the country. And as much as I try to see you and the kids, I can't just abandon my responsibilities."\n\nSarah looked at him. " I know you have responsibilities. I just wish you could be around more. You just seem so distant in so many ways." Sarah sighed and turned her head away from Juscelino. " I just wish I could see you more. You're just gone for long amounts of time. And sometimes I think that you are off doing things that don't relate to your responsibilities."\n\nJuscelino twitched. He had been spending a fair number of days and nights with his mistresses. Did she know? Had someone told her what he had done? Guilt began to wash over Juscelino as he remembered the nights he could have been home but was instead with his mistresses. " Look." He sighed. " I promise I will try to find more time to be home with you. But the President of Brazil isn't a job with a lot of free time. Please understand me. I wish you didn't have to go through this, but it's impossible to avoid it."\n\nSarah sighed. "I understand you have to serve Brazil. Just please say you will spend more time with the family."\n\nJuscelino stood up. "I promise I will try to make more time for you and the family." He hesitated for a moment and then began to walk towards the door to the main hallway.

 brazil.298.t: "Akhenaton Reborn"
 brazil.298.desc: "A red sun rising in those early morning hours made the pearly blue Brasília skies as crimson as the soil from the Central Highlands. As the cold night gave way to the scorching day, Oscar Niemeyer's towering white masterpieces started reflecting the light of the sun over the waters of the Paranoá. A shining city on a hill, as spoken by Christ in his sermon, the capital of the tropics prophesied by Saint Don Bosco, which will house wealth and splendour that men couldn't conceive. But prophets would be just madmen if it wasn't for another even rarer breed of man: those who make their prophecies come true.\n\nOne of such men was taking his morning walk on the margins of the Paranoa: President Juscelino Kubitschek. As he stared at the city the President could only think of that time decades ago when him, then a young student, first heard the tale of Akhenaton. A visionary pharaoh that broke with the old ways of Egypt and took his people to a new golden age, the man who dared to leave his whole civilization behind and start again building a new city at the banks of the Nile, shaped as a bird reaching for the skies.A man who was hated but a man who would never be forgotten. A man who dared\n\nAnd as Akhenaton before him JK dared. He remembers when people called him insane, he remember the tornados and the rainfall stopping the work, he remembers when his presidential plane crashed in Brazilia's building site and Lacerda worte in his newspaper in tall letters "Lost Control: Juscelino Crashes Country Over Brasília", he remember the ultimatum he got from Congress but he also remember the Brazilian People that followed his vision. Now before his eyes he can see his Nile in the Paranoá, the roads of Plano Piloto spread their wings like the Ibis and on the sun kissed windows of the Alvorada he had set his Great Temple."

 brazil.299.desc: "The wind whipped through Kubitschek' hair as he stood on a beach in Rio Grande de Sul. The waves crashing across the rocks roared as he looked up the beach towards the town. He turned towards one of the engineers he had brought along with him. "This is one of the places?"\n\n"Yes. It is nice and close to the shore, there is a town up the higher part of the beach, the soil is nice and firm without having too many rocks. It's perfect for a road."\n\nKubitschek smiled as he turned to the town. I'm sure they will appreciate the new jobs this construction will give them."\n\n"Uh- Yes I'm sure they will." said the engineer as he continued to look at his notes.\n\nThis was not some small road to connect a beach town in Rio Grande de Sul. This would be his infrastructure masterpiece. A planned Highway to go across the entire coast of Brazil. A grand connective piece to further bring Brazil closer to the future. Kubitschek had brought some of the engineers that worked on the Transamozonian highway to help him on this project. They were currently all over the coast, evaluating areas for the highway to go through. From Reclife to Rio Grande de Sul, the highway that would connect the country. It was genius! Kubitschek began to think of the possibilities. This would be a massive boat to the Brazilian economy. And would only further drive up the automotive industry. It would be a major strain on the government, but Kubiitschek had put his best men to the task. And the benefits greatly outweighed the risks. He could already see the long lines of cars going down the roads, bustling towns forming around roadstops. As he turned to the ocean and looked out to the vast waves Kubitschek felt ready for anything. The Transatlantic highway was going to be built."

Kubitschek and Goulart had planned to meet at his house.\n\nAs he walked up to where Goulart was standing in the arch of the doorway, he noticed something off about him. He looked ragged, like he had just rolled out of bed. And there was a distant sadness in the corner of his eyes, some hollow failure. Goulart took a second before answering Kubitschek, "It is a great pleasure to see you as well."A small smile came across his face as he reached his hand to shake hands. He turned to face the inside of his home."Please, come in."\n\nThey walked into the interior of Goulat's home together. The home was nice looking enough, but slightly messy. They turned and walked into the main sitting room. "I never thought I would have a VP that wasn't you João." said Kubitscheck as they sat down. " You were one of the best people I have ever worked with. The Presidency won't be the same without you."\n\nGoulart looked up at Kubitscheck with some joy in his eyes. "Well Edna Lott won't let you down. She has had an exemplary career in the PTB, JK. And I've spoken to her myself, she seems very bright."\n\n"I hope she is." Kubitshchek chuckled, "From what I've seen and heard  of her, she seems very... opinionated." Kubitschek leaned closer to Goulart. " Even though you unfortunately cannot be my Vice President, I still need your help."\n\n"My help? What could I do for you?" Goulart replied\n\n"João you still are the leader of the House of Deputies are you not? Plus the leader of the PTB. I need you to help me to push through legislation that will help Brazil, improve quality of life for all. You need to be my right hand man in the house, or it could all fall apart. I need you."\n\nGoulart looked surprised for a second, as if he had forgotten the tremendous power he holds over Brazilian politics. "Of course I would help you pursue your policies. We both want to help the people, to continue the legacy of Vargas. You have my full support."\n\nKubitschek replied "Excellent my friend. I am very happy to hear that." Both men stood up, and shook each other's hands. "Let's hope this produces some good for Brazil.""

"I wanted to wish you good luck on your inauguration." said Neves.\n\nKubitschek had a large smile come across his face. "Thank you very much Tancredo. And." He said turning to him. "I want to thank you for helping me with my campaign. Your help is invaluable to me. And it will be a pleasure to have you in my cabinet again."\n\n"It was my joy to help you JK."\n\nKubitschek opened the door of the car that was prepared to take him to his inauguration.

A member of his association in São Paulo had been busted for corruption. Sadly the man had been less adept at covering his track than Adhemar. Thankfully the man had kept his connection to the president (and the resulting pile of evidence) secret. Adhemar admired loyalty. But how to help the poor unfortunate man?\n\nLeaving the man to fend for himself was an option. Especially in this electoral year. But the thought of abandoning his associate to a long jail sentence made the president distraught. Pardoning him on the other hand, would signal to friends and foes that no one messed with the president's own without a damn good reason. Scandal rags might speculate on the president's corruption, but what did he care? Everyone already knew.\n\nThe final alternative was to pull some string and have the police release him without trial. This would raise some eyebrows, but less than moving out in the open to free him. Perhaps here as in all things, the golden mean would hold true?"

Sons and daughters of European immigrants. German beer. Italian wine. Electors invited for drinks wherever he went, his two bodyguards trailing him crow-like in their dark suits. They reminded the president of Huninn and Muginn. Or had it been the other way around?\n\nThere had been plans of campaigning. Outreach to German-Brazilians and Italian-Brazilians. But the good time had overwhelmed president Adhemar. So many dances, so much great food, so many great drinks. After so many rounds, any speech the president made would have approximated Janios Quadros usual level of sobriety. Better to, uh, better to take the evening off."

President Adhemar was nonplussed to find a mid-level muckamuck and former associate of his had ratted him out to the authorities. Some story about corruption on a highway contract. The irritated president had to think long and hard to remember which corruption contract could possibly have been revealed to the media.\n\nWhat to do then? Going on the attack was certainly an option. Adhemar knew pricks like this often didn't go fully clean to the police. Embarrassing their source by revealing all of his dirty laundry would do much to shift the conversation away from the president. It would certainly feel good to shut-up that double-dealing idiot. Of course, reacting aggressively was in some ways an admission of guilt. Perhaps Adhemar simply denying the allegations without attacking the source would look more credible to the nation.\n\nFinally, there was the option not to say or do anything. Adhemar was known by all as the man who stole but got things done. Were any of these accusations off-brand? The president had more important things to tend to."

Shaking her hand, Adhemar observed this woman, who had against all odds climbed to the vice presidency.\n\nIn history's oddly sardonic sense of humor, where her father had had a right wing vice president opposed to his presidency, Edna Lott now seemed poised to stand on the president's left. A rising star of the PTB. Uncomfortable a replacement to vice-president Natel's pliable ways.\n\nAdhemar smiled further."You've the charisma your father always lacked, Senhora Lott."\n\n"And you've the confidence and populism this country's conservatives never could attain. I do not wish to play games with you, mister president. You make a mockery of poor Brazilian's issues. You give them trinkets where deep reforms are required. I fully intend to use my office to monitor your work. Assuming your claims of seeking to help poor workers are not total rubbish, we may find ground for cooperation. Until then, you must forgive me for not being eager to share an office term with you, mister president. I would not begrudge you a similar irritation."\n\nAdhemar refrained from smiling, lest he aggravate his new vice-president any further. She had her father's stubborn honesty, enhanced by a woman's wiles. The cohabitation would be uncomfortable. Yet how much more entertaining."

Now that the prize was his, however, it was time to close shop and move to Brasília.\n\nThe safe had been moved, the money partially cycled through a few fronts before accompanying him to the capital. Files of blackmail and intel had been read by him. The still useful stuff would be kept safe in a safehouse in the city. The rest had been burned. There was not much more to clean or move in the office. He had kept it mostly spartan. As a front facing area bringing in dirty laundry would have not been helpful.\n\nAdhemar moved to the window. He'd miss São Paulo. From time to time the wind brought over if not the feel of the endless ocean, then a certain idea of the sea . Infinitely better than Brasília's stuffy continental atmosphere.\n\nNo use dillydallying. Adhemar picked up his briefcase, placed his chair under the desk, and left the room."

The engine purred to life as the keys turned. Adhemar smiled as he began to pull the VW beetle out from the dealership he had got it from. The dealer smiled as he waved to Adhemar as he looked back one last time before pulling out onto the main road. Adhemar waved back as he continued to drive his brand new bought car.\n\nAdhemar flexed his hands on the steering wheel as he continued to drive down the street. It was about time he got a new car. He had been driving an old Ford since the 30s, and it was time for the upgrade. And the VW was a smooth car to drive. It was nice and compact, had a smooth leather interior, and was cheap. The Germans may be insane genocidal maniacs, but they could make a car.\n\nAs Adhemar cruised down the road's of São Paulo he began to look at his surroundings. The bustling streets of people, the children running up and down the road, and the old men gossiping on porches. Adhemar smilied. It was a beautiful day. But as he turned the corner he frowned a little.\n\nA big rustbucket of a car was sitting in a parking lot across the street near a restaurant. Normally, this wouldn't be a cause for concern, there were a lot of old cars in the city, but this was a police cruiser. Adhemar murmured to himself. He had planned to replace the old outdated police cruisers of the state, but he hadn't found the time.\n\nAdhemar began to think of what he should replace the old police cruisers with. Maybe he could replace them with a VW Beetle like the one he just bought. It was a smooth running vehicle, was an okay size, and was cheap enough to mass produce for the police force. But getting a contract from the Germans might not be the best move politically. There was always the choice of an American company. Recently Adhemar had heard someone praising Willys Aero. A car from a decade ago, but a quality one nonetheless. Adhemar had seen people driving them all over the city. It seemed like a safe bet to buy the Aero for the police. As Adhemar pulled into the parking lot of the Capital, he decided to begin to formulate a plan to approach one of the car manufacturers.  He sat for a moment thought, about it, then decided"

Not because it was gaudy, but rather because he knew how the governor got his office looking like this, and he was about to participate in it. The doors swung open, and a mustachioed man in a blindingly white suit entered. "Ah, I suppose the secretary sent you up here? Very good!" Adhemar de Barros laughed, apparently at nothing in particular.\n\n"Hello, Governor." Castelo Branco said. "No need for pleasantries, let's get down to business. What do you want for São Paulo?"\n\nAdhemar laughed again. "Now, now, General, who said there is no time for pleasantries? A drink, perhaps? I have a lovely Petit Verdot, straight from France..." He walked over to the drinks cabinet.  "Or, perhaps a brandy?"\n\n"Where did you get French wine, Governor?" Castelo Branco grimaced.\n\n"Oh, I have my ways, General. I..." He poured a glass of brandy. "...Have my ways. Cheers."\n\nAdhemar took a sip. "Anyway, business." He smiled. Castelo Branco was fuming at this point, that the Governor would have the audacity to extend this meeting.\n\n"We'll give you three million US dollars, Governor." the General said.\n\n"Not enough." Adhemar de Barros leaned back.\n\nThe General exhaled in frustration. "Five million."\n\n"Now, now, General, I can't believe you think so low of me. I want power. I want to be Interior Minister, at least."\n\nCastelo Branco sighed. "Fine, but not immediately. In a year or so."\n\nAdhemar smiled. "Very good. You can find your own way out, General."

Or have you paid off Eduardo again, just so you can finally dig yourself out of that deep hole you're in?" One of the soldiers gave a hearty chuckle, while the dealer quietly shuffled the deck twice, just to be safe. "Marco, let's be honest here. By the time this round finishes, it will be you who owes me an extra lunch, and not the other way around!"\n\nTwo knocks resonated on the side of the truck, before Felix's sergeant came around to the opening. Felix begrudgingly grabbed his rifle and started to dismount the truck, spotting a single man in the distance moving towards the house that they were supposed to watch. Despite being under house arrest and allowed guards, this man rarely had any visitors. On a fast day, there would be 3, tops. Was it because the military wasn't letting anyone see him, Felix thought? "Hey Sarge, who exactly are we guarding here again?"\n\n"Felix, do you not read anything I tell you to?!", huffed his sergeant, while staring at the visitor through a pair of binoculars. "We're literally guarding Vargas. Dig your head out of the dirt next time, Christ. His son's coming up right now." "Are we just going to let him in? Won't that be an issue for us later?" questioned Felix. "No, our orders are to let people in; even the son. We deal with them later if they're being a nuisance." As Vargas Jr. entered his father's home, the sergeant put down his binoculars, and reached for his cigarettes. "You boys can go back to your poker game for now. Oh, and Felix!

Yet, he couldn't hate more how hard it was to navigate the labyrinthic maze of his hometown in such a stuffy, tight uniform, and how too much attention it brought from the passerby's, who stared at him in varying degrees of incredulity and disgust; what did it go wrong?

Tense minutes stretched, before, with a defeated sigh, Lott took a pen from the interrogator's chest pocket and wrote a set of papers he brought to him.\n\nAs he left the interrogation room, he was asked how did he do it?

It took luck, cashing in every single favor and goodwill he has acquired in his career, coupled with his friendship with Brizola, to even have this much headstart. The military was after him, whoever he has ever associated, his immediate family, all of them, to get rid of him like Russia did it's Tsar so long ago, and as much as he loved his country, he loved Brazil, he couldn't risk Maria and his kids to die with him for something petty like Politics.\n\n"We're here, Sir."\n\nThe voice of his heavily accented, northerner driver broke him out of his panic stupor. Giving a loud thanks, and shaking his family awake, they all but scrambled out of the car, towards the helicopter.

He knew he was watching the military take the democratic institution to an execution row, but why go down with the rest of them?\n\nEven if by the military's gunpoint, he could be the president of Brazil, and push the country to the direction he always envisioned it to be, he wouldn't mind having a little bit less leeway as he normally would; he and the military, after all, shared many fundamental beliefs that could be grounds to a solid partnership: No Communists, no Fascists, and the moral and good beliefs at the forefront of the nation.\n\nWith a final click, the final punctuation mark was set on his article praising the military's "bravery towards safeguarding Brazil's moral compass and goodwill towards the free nations of the world." It was bullshit, he knew it was bullshit, but did it matter? Repeat a mantra a thousand times, until it becomes true. Putting it in a folder to send to his secretary and editors later, he brings his phone, and disks some numbers he already knew by memory.\n\nTime to do some calls with his old contacts at the headquarters."

Ester has heard many things, in her tenure as Lacerda's secretary, to the point she frankly felt she couldn't bring anything but a non-committal answer to whatever mood swing Lacerda was up to that day, but even somebody as stoic as her couldn't help but give a grave thrum on her throat as she read the newspaper. "President Castelo Branco approves measure AI-2, giving him extra-constitutional powers, the nullification of every election result before the establishment of this mandate, and dissolution of all direct elections until prior notice?! This is, this is taking democracy and just shooting it in the alleyway! I won't stand by it, this was my bloody chance! I- I will-" Maybe it was self-instinct to preserve herself and her job, or perhaps something deep inside of her cared for the loud braggart of a man that was her boss, as she simply held him tightly by the grip and pointed at the window. Lacerda gazed, his face still flushed red, before it paled at the sight of rolling tanks by the streets, soldiers openly brandishing automatic weapons, and the people observing by the walkaway the march. "...right, right, I...I would just be putting myself on the same bloody list as Amazonas. I'll...I'll just shut up. Keep my head low, I still have Guanabara...I can keep things as normal as they can..." Ester nodded, returning to her work...yet her heart wasn't to it, but to her family, her sister Marietta at the countryside, were they okay? She was always quite loud... Her thoughts were interrupted by the opening of Lacerda's office, and the man's voice echoed. "Call my pilot, make sure he's always on stand-by. I want my plane out of my hangar in São Paulo, and back to Guanabara. Just...just in case."\n\nShe never thought she would hear that emotion in that man's voice."

Juscelino couldn't be prouder of his country, for thwarting the Military's ambitions once again, and holding the torch of Democracy, as they ever do. Glancing at his side, to Neves's warm grin, he holds his cup, and the soon-to-be ex-president again can't help but toast his old friend. "What now, JK?" JK glances at Neves, a practiced smile almost crossing his lips before he simply gives a lopsided, genuine smile. There was no need for carefully sculpted expressions and tells with a man like Neves. "It's a huge disappointment, but the people spoke, a thing that wouldn't have been possible a few weeks ago. Even if I'm not the one in the Planalto, it will be a civilian president, not an upstart major wanting to blame everything on communists to make Brazil their little kingdom." JK laughs, finishing his cup. "I've written my letters, I've tied my loose ends, but I can return, Neves. I can bloody well return any time I want. I'll go back to Rio, I'll see what I did wrong, and one day I'll be in the Palácio do Planalto again, and only God will be able to stop me because the military sure couldn't." Neves can't help but give an amused chuckle at his friend, as the alcohol is starting to get to the "Co-Architect of Brazil." And that moment he knew, JK would be fine."

Months wouldn't be enough, wouldn't ever be enough to make sure Brazil, in all its pristine, shining glory, could stand as the leader of South America it was always meant to be.\n\nAll they needed was to vote on the right candidate, and they didn't.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, thoughts of trying that went through his head: Democracy sometimes simply needed a nudge in the right direction, and he knew that better than most, after all. But, that moment all but died, as he thought further, and saw the benefits...\n\nIf, however, whoever got in the Planalto did a lousy job, he could do what he has always done best, this time with experience as a President to back him up. He could use the little time he got as a platform, of what he could do, if the people would just bloody vote right the next time.\n\nIf it was Vargas' little spawn or his accursed protege, maybe he would consider that, but as it stands, it would be too little to gain over the massive risk; democracy in Brazil wasn't going anywhere anymore, and he would have his chance.

And that's how he found himself, half a bottle of Pinga in his hands, a half spent pack of cigarettes in his pocket, and the Television playing a game of soccer that he wasn't sure he was fully paying attention to.\n\nHis face felt wet, warm, painful from the tears, disappointment, and sorrow boiling in him, for letting the people down, Brazil down, Vargas down. Sure, it could have been much worse, but the fact this happened because of him can't help but haunt him, like a specter gripping his heart, tighter and tighter until it po-\n\nHe didn't realize, but the grip on his body wasn't his failures, but Maria Thereza, pulling his head on her shoulder, silently giving company to him, and his bleeding, emotional heart.\n\nHe knew there would be other chances. Other opportunities, other venues to put his dream of a fair Brazil to the nation. He wasn't alone, he had friends, family, a loving wife, and he was on the soil of the country he loved so much.\n\nHe would be fine."

What age would he be in 1970, late 60's, he would be 74 by the end of that term if he won the election. No Adhemar thought, there would be no fourth run, no fourth blitz across Brazil, no more shaking hands and kissing babies. The presidency which had been so close yet so, so far away had evaded his grasp once and for all. The presidency of Adhemar de Barros would be consigned to the work of fiction writers discussing what could have been.\n\nAdhemar stood up to go outside and thank everyone for their hard work and contribution to the campaign and that this was not the end. But then a small thought emerged in the back of his head, one of those thoughts that start out small, but then rapidly grow and grow and grow until it is all you can think about. What if this was not the end.\n\nDespite his age he could still easily play an influential role in Brazilian politics. He was a political grandee and had played a crucial role in Brazilian politics for the last decade, despite never being a senator or reaching the presidency.\n\nHe just needed an heir, an heir to his ideals and the PSP. An heir that would outlast even him when one day he died. But who could it be Adhemar thought. The answer was obvious, the man he had endorsed for the Governor of São Paulo, the man who he had personally appointed as his replacement and had won in a landslide election as governor for the state. Adhemar paused for a moment, him? Really? the rich playboy philanthropist son of a former president. Would this man truly be capabale of continuing where Adhemar left off, well with his guidance he could.\n\nAdhemar broke into a smirk and exited his office, quickly thanking and passing by those who had come to see him before he reached his secretary."

He had campaigned for months, endured personal tragedy, spent countless hours under hot studio lights, and spent years in the political field trying to change Brazil. And yet he had still lost. All of his work, sweat, blood, tears had been thrown away in one election. So now he sat in a drunken stupor staring out the window. The television murmured in the background as he continued to stare blankly out the window thinking of what had just happened.\n\nHe and those around him had been so confident that his loss was a terrible shock when it came. He took another deep drink from his bottle. His father, he had failed his father. He had sworn he was going to be president, and he had been absolutely sure of him. Yet here he was. He walked to the window in his room and opened it, letting the cool wind wash over him. In the distance Quadros could hear the cracking of fireworks. As the air moved through his body he looked down. He was still holding the nearly empty bottle of liquor. He saw his own distorted reflection in the bottle. He looked more like a mess than usual. His face puffy and red. His hair was in a tangle on his head. He had no idea where his glasses were. He looked like a failure.\n\nThe Americans would still run rampant through Brazil, corruption would still reign, the economy would still be a mess. None of his dreams would ever come to fruition.  Quadros stood still for a second and then violently threw the bottle as far as he could. The bottle flew through the air and shattered with a distant crash as he stormed back into the room.\nNo. He had not failed yet. There were still things to be done and battles to be fought. Even though Brazil had rejected him, there were still other countries and groups to champion. He could go to other Latin American countries, and spread his vision. Maybe, if he was lucky, it could even gain traction in Brazil. But he needed to begin planning immediately.\n\nJânio Quadros would not be a failure."

They sat down and broke out a few drinks - but not too many, as Lott very much liked to remain sober.\n\nThey talked about things that had gone well, and things that had not gone so well. There were disagreements here and there, but not of the kind that had punctuated their interactions before 1962. In fact the two of them found that, despite their differing backgrounds and political ideologies, they agreed on no small number of things. Lott acknowledged that, all things considered, it had been a good decision to defer to Quadros in the places where he had deferred to him. Quadros also freely acknowledged that, all things considered, Lott had done a fairly good job.\n\nThe day wore on, and the discussion changed to topics less directly involving them. Quadros and Lott were both concerned about the recent rumors of hardline communist guerillas in the north, but Lott convinced Quadros not to worry about it too much unless it became a real issue. After a while spent just engaging in small talk - asking after each other's families and whatnot - and exchanging jokes back and forth, the two realized with a start that the sky was red and the sun was low in the sky. So the former president and his second-in-command shook hands and parted ways in some haste, but not before hammering out ways to keep in touch."

At last, after a half-decade he was free from that nuisance, and he was now free to take his ease.\n\nAs he sipped his drink, he read a report about stirrings by communists in the far north of the country. The intelligence report indicated that it was nothing serious yet; he, therefore, would not worry about it until there was a legitimate cause for concern.\n\nPutting the report down, Lott sighed and reflected on another thing that had gone wrong during the last half-decade - his relationship with Jânio Quadros. He wondered just where it had gone so wrong, that Quadros would have tried to do what he did. After a brief moment spent ruminating on the situation, he dismissed his concerns. It was a good riddance. The man had to go. He had been too much of a hassle to work with.\n\nDismissing that thought, the marshal continued to take his ease."

I've been getting used to the way things work. Jango's been showing me the ropes, and I've been in touch with Tancredo here and there. Leonel's been pretty helpful too, even if he's a bit radical for my tastes."\n\n"Ah, well, you'll disagree with them once in a while, and there will even be conflicts, but whatever you do, you need to stay strong and stick to your principles.\n\n"I understand, dad."\n\n"Good.

The last days of his term.\n\n"I am announcing that I will be retiring from politics, effective immediately..."\n\nAs these things went through his mind, and as his speech reached its end, Lott found himself becoming slightly emotional; emotional enough, in fact, that everyone noticed it and was surprised.

At this point, the conservative Jânio Quadros, with whom Lott had managed to build a good relationship, became of great use; it helped that he was just as worried as Lott was at the prospect of a coup.\n\nLott tried and failed to get anything more than basic expressions of consideration from these people, and that was if he was lucky. Some of them outright started spewing propagandistic talking points of the sort that would not be out of place in Costa e Silva's mouth. Others, on the other hand, said that they were sympathetic, but then started to repeat "concerns" that Lacerda had raised in the various newspapers he owned and controlled. It was at this point that Lott realized that the Crow was likely working against him, probably because he hoped the military might help him take power someday.\n\nThere was nothing to be gained from Lott attempting to persuade them himself. So he sent his vice-president in and waited for the results.\n\nSaid vice-president barged into his office in the Palácio do Planalto in two hours flat, bearing expressions of support from no small number of deputies and senators.

I must ask you to think through the situation. The President may have uttered a foolhardy remark, but you speak as if his word is law and goes through unquestioned. You speak as if myself or Senhor Neves have no power to make him reconsider things."\n\nKubitschek smirked internally. They did not need to know that Lott had in fact out-and-out refused to reconsider things. "And if even if he goes through with it, let us be realistic, gentlemen: Lott and the PSD remain the best choice you have. If you go to Lacerda, what will that crow do?

Or perhaps my friend Senhor Salgado, who will have you screaming Anauê at the top of your lungs and make you produce carriages that even Pedro Álvares Cabral would find outdated?"\n\nAt this point, the manufacturers were shouting in outrage. Kubitschek raised his hand again, and made his final point. "You see that being told to 'reduce your prices' is the least of the evils you can deal with in this country."

"Most of you can agree that great presidents do not simply uphold the status-quo. No, they take the reins of their country, and drive it forwards towards progress. They use their power to leave a better country in their wake. The Presidency is not for the meek. You need to have ambition, a fire burning in your soul, to light the way forward.

Sources close to the governor report his increasing anger with the secretary regarding the death of multiple homeless men who have washed up on a beach in Rio with seemingly little explanation. Detectives are currently treating the case as a homicide, though there are no suspects or people of interest in custody currently. The secretary's inability to solve this particular case has drawn Lacerda's ire, though no one truly knows why.\n\nIt is not uncommon for murders to go unsolved in Brazil's largest city, but it appears as if Governor Lacerda is focused on improving the murder clearance rate. When asked about the sudden firing of the Secretary of Security, Lacerda refused to comment on the firing but mentioned that "the faithful servants of Guanabara will ensure that justice is brought to our fellow countrymen", and emphasized that "Guanabara is for all of our brothers and sisters, poor or rich". Paperwork on behalf of the governor's office today was filed, detailing the creation of an independent investigation and committee to assist the detectives in solving this particular murder, but political analysts expect it to stick around to try and improve Rio's abysmal murder clearance rate and train both patrol officers and detectives to cut down on violent crime.\n\nGovernor Lacerda has been praised by many for his efforts to improve Rio's plumbing systems and ensuring that all citizens have access to clean water. He is significantly more controversial regarding his decisions on public housing and "clearing" space for projects, while evicting thousands of residents. Regardless, few critics have criticized Lacerda's recent efforts regarding violent crime in the city, though some are skeptical about its success. Only time will tell whether or not Governor Lacerda's efforts to bridge the gap between Rio's poor and rich will yield any fruit.\n\nIf you have any tips or information regarding the death of the homeless man, please call Guanabara police.

 brazil.333.desc: "When Carlos Lacerda met with his American opposite number, President George Corley Wallace, he was manifestly unimpressed. This made sense, since Lacerda abhorred racism, while Wallace was addicted to it the same way that good-for-nothing Getúlio Vargas was to eating two lunches and three dinners a day. At least Vargas wasn't usually a racial bigot, unlike Lacerda's present interlocutor.\n\nLacerda's disapproval seeped through frequently during the discussion, which was tense most of the time. The only times the two agreed wholeheartedly on something were in the cases of trade - opening more trade between Brazil and America struck them both as a good deal, provided that neither country's interests were violated - and joining the Organization of Free Nations, since even a conservative like Wallace knew the value of the OFN and was pledged to support it. But these successful discussions were at times overshadowed by the sheer number of things the two presidents disagreed on.\n\nAt the end of the discussion, Lacerda offered a word of advice. "Before I continue, Mr Wallace, I'd like to offer you a bit of personal advice. None of what I am about to say is on my people's behalf."\n\nWallace stiffened. He could guess what Lacerda was going to say. "Go ahead, Mr Lacerda."\n\n"Sir, your nation has made significant progress in the past few years on how it treats people who aren't white, and it has only benefited America to do so. I'd advise you to avoid the urge towards radical changes overturning the last administrations' legislation in that direction."\n\nIt was as Wallace had suspected, and it made him angry. To his credit, he waited until after Lacerda had left to fly into a rage at Lacerda's 'presumption'. But he had not accounted for the fact that Lacerda had sources able to tell him just what he ended up saying.\n\nWhen Lacerda read the report, he laughed. It was the only thing he could do to distract himself from his worries about what "that bigot in the White House" might do to America."
 brazil.333.a: "Not the best of starts."

 brazil.334.t: "The Crow and LBJ"
 brazil.334.desc: "When Carlos Lacerda met with his American opposite number, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the two got along more or less, though Lacerda found that Johnson's Great Society theory was altogether too reminiscent of Getulism for his taste (not that he'd say that and run the risk of making himself look obsessed). Most of their conversation was about foreign policy; Johnson would try to push the envelope a bit further, and Lacerda would try and keep it from going too far.\n\n"Mister Lacerda, I'm really grateful that you want to deepen Brazil's cooperation with the Organization of Free Nations, and I'm really impressed by the work Brazilian boys have done fighting side by side with us on the South African Front. But the cause of freedom can't be served by just fighting on the same side in one war. Can the United States rely on Brazil to make a firm commitment to aiding us in future conflicts on foreign soil?"\n\nLacerda made a noncommittal noise. "Well, Mr President, I'll have to say "yes and no" to that. If it's dealing with the Nazi colonists in Africa I'll back you to the hilt. If you see the need to deal with fascists and communists in South America I might be able to arrange something. But other future conflicts will be more difficult, I fear."\n\nJohnson nodded slowly. "I understand."\n\nFor a brief moment, he considered trying to intimidate Lacerda, but decided against it. Lacerda was enthusiastic about serving freedom, after all, and it wouldn't do to dampen such things. Besides, from what Johnson had heard of Lacerda and the other possible presidential candidates in those Hundred Days of theirs, he didn't think any of them - even that one pinko Gullet or Gully or whatever he was called - would break under his blustering. So he settled for moving the discussion on to other matters."
 brazil.334.a: "When asked, the two reported that they were satisfied with the meeting."

 brazil.335.t: "The Crow and the Voice of Reason"
 brazil.335.desc: "When Carlos Lacerda met with his American opposite number, President Wallace F. Bennett, they hit it off immediately and were on a first-name basis within some minutes. This made sense since they shared goals on using the market to strengthen their economies and joining hands in the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nThe discussion was long-reaching and changed topics relatively quickly, since the two of them were struggling to find areas on which they disagreed. On the matter of reducing mutual trade barriers, they found themselves in complete agreement, reaching a formal accord on the matter within minutes. On the matter of Brazil's joining the OFN, Bennett offered to push for Brazil's membership as soon as possible, to which Lacerda enthusiastically agreed.\n\nAfter they had exhausted every possible avenue of discussion and reached some form of agreement on everything, they went on to small talk, which continued for a good while.\n\nThe two of them felt that they had developed a good working relationship with one another, and were on track to push Brazil and the United States closer together than ever before.\n\nAt last it was time for the two to part ways for the day, and Bennett asked one last question as he reached out to shake Lacerda's hand. "Carlos, can America and Brazil expect to see more of each other under your administration? Will you keep on integrating your country with the Organization of Free Nations?"\n\nLacerda smiled widely and nodded. "Most certainly, Wallace, one hundred percent."\n\nThat was the start of a friendship that lasted for decades."

 brazil.336.t: "The Crow and the Reformer"
 brazil.336.desc: "When Carlos Lacerda met with his American opposite number, President Robert Francis Kennedy, he was not sure what to make of the slain JFK's younger brother. True, they got on when discussing foreign policy - Kennedy shared Lacerda's antifascism and zeal for the rights of the average citizen - and they were able to reach fruitful agreements with regard to Brazil's upcoming attempt to join the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nBut aside from that Lacerda, though he respected Kennedy's work ethic and devotion to his country, found himself increasingly uncomfortable with the president of the United States. Lacerda could not place it; it could have been Kennedy's zeal and the way he looked, or it might have been what Lacerda had heard of the man's proposed programs. But he found that some unclear thing in his interactions with Kennedy reminded him of Getúlio Vargas in a bad way.\n\nOn the other hand, Kennedy was unimpressed with his Brazilian opposite number. He had heard concerning rumours about Lacerda's willingness to sweep aside the poor and his political opponents in the name of promoting the welfare of Brazil. Moreover, he found that Lacerda lacked ambition and did not appear to be as devoted to the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as he said he was.\n\nDespite these reservations, the two heads of state remained civil, and reached fruitful agreements that would doubtless lead to further cooperation between Brazil and the United States. But each of them came away feeling that for all that they had been speaking the same English, they had still been talking in entirely different languages."

 brazil.338.t: "A School for Anne"
 brazil.338.desc: ""-And it is with the deepest honor and gratitude to the people of Rio and the Jewish community that I inaugurate Anne Frank Secondary School."\n\nLacerda cut the ribbon, then turned to put on his smartest grin as he faced the cameras and applause again. He even let out a bow for the press's sake.\n\nHe continued onto his speech, staring hard at the neighboring building - the German Consulate, just opposite from the new school. The Nazi bastards had angrily shut their curtains. Good. He'd make sure they got front-row seats to see Jewish children, alive and well, attending school and living normal lives.\n\n"I stayed up until 5am reading Anne Frank's diary, mere months after when it had been first smuggled out of Germany and published around the Free World as an indictment of German atrocities. It is a truly moving document."\n\n"That poor girl had died alone and betrayed, starving and sick, robbed of any dignity she had left."\n\nHe held his head high and stared at the disgusting Nazi flag flying outside the consulate, that had the gall to taint Brazil with its hateful presence.\n\n"The least I can do to avenge her was give her people some of that dignity back! And God willing, I will make sure Brazil protects you, or die in the attempt!"\n\nThe resulting applause could deafen an entire stadium."

But it had failed. He had failed.\n\nHe prayed that God would have mercy on Brazil, and on its future presidents. They would have to reckon with the threat of the hardliners despite his best efforts to do away with the threat.\n\nLott maintained a stoic front, but his defense minister, Odylio Denys, could tell how disappointed he was. "Don't get yourself down, Henrique, you did everything you possibly could."\n\nLott nodded and sighed. "This happened because the politicians were too damned cowardly to do their jobs, to defend their own mandates. Well, it matters not. If they cannot do it, that does not mean I can't.

And it had succeeded.\n\nThank God, hell, thank His Mother too. It had succeeded. Brazil was free from military threats.\n\nPresident Lott celebrated the success of his passion project by drinking some champagne in the presence of prominent constitutionalists in the Brazilian military, many of whom were flush with joy and hope (as well they might be).\n\nLott made a small speech. "We have managed, gentlemen, to ensure that the Brazilian military is first and foremost a defender of democracy. We have at last succeeded in showing Costa e Silva and the other elitists their place. Gentlemen, I congratulate you and salute your efforts!"\n\nA few cheers and a wave of applause ensued. But amidst all this, Marshal Odylio Denys did not join in the enthusiasm. His expression was oddly neutral given the happiness surrounding him.

The potential threat posed by ambitious hardliners in the old and young guards of the armed forces was analyzed from countless different angles, and methods to keep them down and out were hammered out.\n\nLott ended the meeting by reminding the officers that democracy needed eternal vigilance to survive; if constitutionalist vigilance failed, it would likely mean ruin for the constitutionalists and their families, to say nothing of the armed forces and Brazil itself.

 brazil.401.t: "National Electric Act Passes!"
 brazil.401.desc: "Cheers and clapping could be heard outside the Senado today, after the passage of the National Electric Act Act. One of President Goulart's most sought after reforms, the act establishes the state-owned electricity company in order to try and wrest some control of Brazil's energy infrastructure back into her own hands from foreign corporations. While the UDN and other opposition parties have decried this move as nothing more than "blatant socialism and market manipulation", supporters of the act point to the vast inequality regarding access to the nation's electrical grid that is holding back the Brazilian people. Furthermore, they also maintain that cheap and consistent access to electricity will fuel job creation, increase the living standards of the people, and push industrialization in poorly-developed areas.\n\nPresident Goulart made a speech today, echoing the benefits, and pushed for additional infrastructure projects that would see Brazil's electrical output quadruple within the decade. He spoke on the steps of the National Congress Building.\n\n"Today is a great day for the people of Brazil. No more will your homes be cast into darkness when the sun sets; no more will you have to suffer through the humid heat; no more will you be subject to blackouts and the greediness of foreign companies. I want to thank the Senado for their support on this bill, and I assure you that my government is working with our brightest engineers to deliver you electrical access as soon as possible, at a price that is fair for all Brazilians. I look forward to continuing the improvement of both this great country, and the lives of our people. Thank you!"\n\nWhile the act technically allows for the seizure and buyout of foreign power companies, the Goulart administration has not yet fully disclosed the details of how these power companies would be transferred under Eletrobras. However, one thing is for certain; even Brazil's poorest families will soon enjoy the myriad of benefits that electricity brings."
 brazil.401.a: "All of Brazil shines together."

 brazil.402.t: "National Electric Act Fails!"
 brazil.402.desc: "The Goulart administration suffered a serious setback today when one its prized pieces of legislation, the National Electric Act, failed to garner enough support in the Senado to pass. The act aimed to nationalize Brazil's electricity infrastructure under one company, in the hopes of improving access for many poor and rural Brazilians while allowing the government to directly invest, maintain, and repair the grid. However, its rejection means that various local, private power companies will maintain their control over the nation's electricity grid. While opponents of the bill celebrate its failure and Brazil's commitment to a free market, supporters are left wondering what else they can try in order to aid those without access to the current grid.\n\nForeign electric companies have been accused of setting exorbitant prices and are prone to random blackouts and power failures, especially in poorer parts of the country. Representatives for Rio Light, one of the private companies, stated that they were "pleased to see the act fail", and maintained their commitment to ensure that all paying customers in their service region would continue to enjoy electricity. When asked about any plans to potentially expand access to poorer, rural regions in the west and north of Brazil, the company refused to comment."

 brazil.403.t: "The Agrarian Relief Act Passes!"
 brazil.403.desc: "Celebrations could be heard across Brazil's farms today, as the Senado passed the Agrarian Relief Act. The act redistributes land from various corporate entities and rich ranchers back down to local peasants and smaller farmers, in the hope of creating more equitable opportunities for the lower class, and to improve agricultural output. President Lott has alleged that many ranchers are inefficiently using their massive plots of land, and that it would be better in the hands of the local populace. Despite calls for compromise from both the unions and the ranchers, President Lott proceeded directly with the original version of the bill, and his gamble appears to have paid off.\n\nThe bill, drafted in response to crippling strikes from various unions across the country, also gives Brazilian banks money for the issuance of loans to peasant and smaller farmers. Although the rich are remarkably unhappy with how their assets are being seized, even they could not argue that they were truly using the land at all. The PTB have agreed to work with provincial officials to accelerate the land redistribution process and ensure that the loans are fairly issued, something the UDN took immediate exception to. Regardless of how much bickering will follow the act, many can agree that there is clearly new management regarding the agricultural sector."

President Lott has alleged that many ranchers are inefficiently using their massive plots of land, and that it would be better in the hands of the local populace. Pressured to negotiate with the unions that were directly causing the strikes, President Lott sat down with several prominent labor figures and implemented their suggestions into the Agrarian Relief Act. Despite renewed opposition from the UDN to try and fail the act, calling it "communism at its core", the PTB-PSD alliance appeared to secure enough votes to force it through.\n\nThe act contains several additional clauses regarding worker treatment in large-scale farms, along with a reduction in hours to the work day. Furthermore, it allows the PTB to work with provincial officials to speed up the land redistribution process, and allots a significant amount of funds to Brazil's banks for the issuance of loans to the peasants and small-scale farmers. Some ranchers, unwilling to surrender such large swaths of their wealth, have apparently fled the country completely. With such a strong land reform act, many in Brazil are wondering how the following piece of legislation could even possibly top this one."

President Lott has alleged that many ranchers are inefficiently using their massive plots of land, and that it would be better in the hands of the local populace. However, he implemented several suggestions from various ranchers in the hope of increasing support for the bills across the PSD, UDN, and PSP. While Lott's gamble to obtain more support from the ranchers appears to have worked, it has also attracted the anger of the unions and the PTB, who have decried the bill as "watered down" and too insignificant to cause any real change.\n\nRegardless, the unions across Brazil have instructed their workers to cease the strikes that effectively brought the country to a halt, and it appears as if the country can finally return to work. As provincial administrations across Brazil work to begin redistributing land, Brazil's various banks are also preparing to issue loans and provide economic relief programs to ensure the peasant farmers don't go bankrupt immediately. While it is difficult to predict if the reforms will continue, many across Brazil can still appreciate the attempt at a more equal agricultural sector."

The act was supposed to redistribute land from rich landowners and then give it to peasants and local farmers, yet the act faced stiff opposition from both the UDN and the PSP immediately after being introduced. With the help of lobbying from the ranchers, the act was defeated by a narrow margin, triggering additional protests and calls from union leadership to continue the strikes. With little to no chance of passing significant land reform, the PTB-PSD coalition is rumored to be at its breaking point, with many members of the PTB betrayed by President Lott's inability to equalize the playing field for farmers, even by a little bit.\n\nWithout the Agrarian Relief Act, much of Brazil's suitable farmland will remain in the hands of a select few, with buyouts of local farmers continuing to remain a common practice. Food prices will likely rise, along with agricultural goods that are used in industrial processes, such as palm oil. Although President Lott and PTB leader João Goulart have pledged to speak to the protestors, it is unlikely that a resolution will be reached quickly, and many political analysts across Brazil are expecting political turmoil for at least the next month. Many hope that the protests do not continue to escalate, lest the military feel the need to intervene with force in the protests."

 brazil.407.desc: "Cheers could be heard throughout Brazil today, as the Voting Rights Act has passed in the Senado. A key cornerstone in the Goulart administration's reforms, the act removes any restrictions on the right to vote for various marginalized groups throughout Brazil. Previously, illiterate, lower-class, or politically disenfranchised citizens were disallowed from voting in elections, and the right to vote was heavily dependent on employment. Opponents of the act pointed to the potential election fraud that could happen, given the size of the voting base, while supporters decried any criticism of the act as "undemocratic hogwash". With the passage of this act, any Brazilian citizen is ensured the right to vote, no matter what. Political activists across the nation are preparing to mobilize this newfound voter base, as it is expected to have a significant, yet unknown effect on Brazil's electoral results.\n\nThe Goulart administration has said that it will work with election officials in every region to expand access to voting, with additional voting sites and potentially increased voting hours on election days. Furthermore, voting rights activists have continued to push for additional monetary and legal reform to encourage and support rural voting. Although some skeptics within the disenfranchised population currently doubt how effective voting truly is, many can agree that Brazil's democracy has turned a new leaf for the better."

 brazil.408.desc: "The status quo prevailed today, as the Voting Rights Act has failed to pass in the Senado. The act tried to remove any and all barriers that prevented the poor, the disenfranchised, and the illiterate from voting in Brazil. While many of Brazil's middle and upper-class citizens who are formally employed in jobs enjoy very little barriers in voting, the right to vote does not extend to those without formal employment, various minorities, and the poor. While opponents of the act state that they are willing to look at electoral reform, they decried the act as too quick a change, instead emphasizing the gradual inclusion of these marginalized groups into Brazil's electorate. President Goulart denounced the failure of the act today as a "mark on our Republic", and pledged to continue looking at ways to expand the right to vote to all Brazilians.\n\nHowever, there is likely a limit to how far-reaching his reforms can be without the support of the Senado, and his goal of seeing every Brazilian able to vote is likely dead, political analysts claim. In addition, even for those who could vote in rural areas, voting access is unlikely to expand, with voting sites located in inconvenient or far-off locations for many. Furthermore, many of Brazil's poor are forced to work on election day, so even with formal employment, many workers are forced to choose between voting, and a day's wages. The gap between Brazil's poor and its middle-class will likely only get bigger, despite the Goulart administration's best efforts. "

The act expanded the Brazilian Volunteer Corps in South Africa by two extra divisions, along with an unspecified number of air wings as support. Supporters of the act cheer its passage, stating the need to defend democracy across the world, and that there was no cost too great to push "the fascist menace out of the African continent". Opponents have cited the human and material cost of a war that Brazil directly sees little benefit from, along with the potential expansion of its draft. In Johannesburg today, the Brazil Armed Forces Command appeared with the commander of US Forces in South Africa, William Westmoreland and issued the following statement,\n\n"The Brazilian Armed Forces have displayed their bravery, courage, and will in this conflict, and we appreciate the sacrifice that they have made in every battle. With their continued aid, we can end this war and secure South Africa as a beacon of liberty for the world to see. To the Brazilian people, we will not forget your cooperation against the perfidious Nazi threat. Thank you."\n\nWhile military observers expect the war to drag on for at least several more months, there is no denying the closer ties that Brazil and the US now enjoy. President Lacerda, while unable to be reached for comment, is known for his desire to bring Brazil into the Organization of Free Nations, and this seems to be one step closer for him to officially join the military alliance. The German Reich, in response, ordered its embassy in Brasília to close within the end of the week, effectively shutting off Brazil from the Einheitspakt."

The act intended to bring an additional two divisions to support the war effort and continue the defence of South Africa against Afrika-Schild aggression, but lacked enough supporters for it to pass. Given the stalemate that the South African War is currently in, military leaders within the OFN were hoping that additional Brazilian volunteers and air wings would be enough to potentially turn the tide. Opponents of the act cheered on its failure in Rio today, citing the blood shed in South Africa for very little benefit back in Brazil. Mothers were seen across the country, hugging their young sons, knowing that they would not have to die in some far-off country defending the arbitrary concept of "freedom" and "liberty". Anti-war activists also scored a huge victory today against the Lacerda administration, and President Lacerda himself is expected to address the nation tonight regarding the war.\n\nA spokesperson for the OFN today expressed that "While Brazil has the right to determine its level of contribution in the South African War, the Organization of Free Nations notices all developments regarding its attitude towards South Africa. Freedom and liberty are under attack, and the nation of Brazil did not rise to their defence." The Lacerda administration has made it a clear goal to try and apply for OFN membership, with President Lacerda even speaking to the OFN a number of times. The failure of this act is likely to serve as a permanent blemish in Brazil-US relations, and complicates Lacerda's goal."

The Act shifts funds and resources over to the Trans-Amazonian Highway, a project that was started under President Lott. Progress has been difficult on many sections of the highway, with the hostile environment and weather, along with the legal issues of purchasing the land and ensuring the fair treatment of the indigenous people living along the highway. However, construction of the highway stalled after evidence surfaced on how Lott was ignoring kickback schemes and bribery by officials in charge of constructing the highway. President Kubitschek has been vocal about his desire to see the highway completed, and the passage of the act gives him and his administration a wide array of resources to see the grand project completed.\n\nOriginally started by President Lott at the start of his term, the Trans-Amazonian Highway has been an albatross around the Brazilian government's neck. Furthermore, as mentioned before, government officials tasked with overseeing highway construction were found to be pocketing public funds and cutting corners with regards to the quality of the highway. President Kubitschek has pledged to resolve these issues and increase oversight on the highway while construction ramps back up. The highway connects the Amazon to the rest of Brazil, opening up a wide array of potential infrastructure and development possibilities, while providing a land route from Brazil to Colombia."

Sponsored by the Kubitschek administration, the act attempted to kickstart construction again on the Trans-Amazonian Highway. However, recent scars from corruption during the Lott administration proved too much to bear, and progress on the massive transportation network will continue to be slow for now. While supporters of the act argued for additional funding, equipment, and manpower to finally finish construction on the highway, many senators were unwilling to see these resources committed to a project that has already taken too long and cost too much.\n\nA combination of low wages, hostile environment, and inept administrators have given the highway the nickname "Lott's greatest folly". Although no one in Brazil wants the project abandoned and stopped, many have begun questioning the actual utility of the highway compared to its cost. Originally intended to link up the undeveloped North and Central-West regions to the prosperous coastline, the highway has suffered from a variety of issues that has prevented its completion. With the failure of this bill, Brazilians are beginning to wonder if the highway can even be completed within the decade."

Now Quadros was reversing at least some of the damage caused by his predecessor's carelessness.\n\nHis secretary had assembled a few memos and newspapers on his desk. Quadros' good mood did not dissipate through the subsequent reading. Memorandums from UDN party grandees, reporting on the anger of many UDN senators with the evacuation of South Africa. The president did not care what a few Lacerdista has-beens did. He was president, and the crow could squawk for all he cared. The people would understand that the UDN's new direction was in their best interest.\n\nMemos about the media he likewise skimmed through. Radio hosts accused him of cravenly caving in and abandoning South Africa to fascism. Editorials in the right wing press deplored the risks to the friendship between Brazil and America.\n\nWhen his aides came in with a cup of coffee, they found the memos and newspaper neatly folded into a pile. The president thanked them for the warm drink, and requested they dispose of all these 'letters to the editor'."

Many are old-school Lacerda followers, who look to the United States as our most logical ally. You've not won them over yet, sir." He did not need to add that Quadros had not convinced him yet, either. Both men had a good working relationship, despite their policy disagreements. The president appreciated the other man's honesty, a rare delight in Brazilian policy.\n\n"What are the alternatives?" Quadros asked.\n\nThe Vice-President sighed. "You could just ignore their wishes, sir. Foreign policy is a president's privilege. But that might not be prudent. Your government is young, sir, and many in the UDN still can't believe you are the one leading them. Of course, letting them win will be a political defeat in the eyes of the public. That's probably what more than a few of Lacerda's faction wish to see you reined in."\n\n"No doubt. And the army?"\n\n"Not much progress in bringing them over to your side. They'll be delighted to see the senate vote in their favor. Overturning it would really aggravate them."\n\nIt was the president's turn to be lost in thoughts. Vice President Campos had still little understanding of how the peculiar president ever reached his conclusions. Eventually Quadros looked up."

 brazil.415.desc: "Power in Brazilian politics can come from the barrel of a gun, or from honeyed words to the rich and influential. In this brave new age, it could also come from the sight of adorable vegetarian bears from the distant orient.\n\nThe nation's intelligentsia and political pundits had not known what to make of the vice-president's efforts to bring back pandas from his recent visit to China. Many mocked the level of effort that had gone into those critters as proof of Quadros' inane beliefs about Brazil leading a concert of tropical nations into a new era of prosperity. Others had attacked the vice-president for wasting the dignity of his office by haggling over these carnival side-shows like some bargain P.T. Barnum. Quite a few newspaper editorials had mockingly taken to referring to the vice-president as "o rei dos pandas". In return Quadros had, in his usual way, gone on a long speech about the virtues of exalting the imagination of the nation. The pandas at the center of the storm had happily carried on munching on bamboo, after a few weeks in cages on a boat.\n\nThe people of São Paulo had gone gaga over the animals. Crowds flocked to the zoo for a chance to see Gaogao and Pelucia. Vice-president Quadros, moonlighting as a zoologist, entertained the crowds with trivia on the bears, as well as regaling them with stories about Sichuanese hot food. After a week or two, when the novelty wore off, the vice-president wandered onto his next pet project. Through all this many in the important political battleground of São Paulo had come away with a positive view of their vice-president. Had it all been a scheme to increase his popularity with the masses? Critics and supporters of Jânio Quadros agreed; it was difficult to keep track of where the vice-president's antics ended and where his political cunning began."

The former businessman's usually impeccable suits were a bit threadbare, of late.\n\n"Yes, Mr. Salles? Please tell me you have good news." Lott rubbed his forehead. His foreign minister fussed with the folder he had brought with him, before speaking.\n\n"I'm afraid news from D.C. are not good. Nixon is angry about Burnham's play, especially late in his term like this. For reasons of domestic politics he is sending in the troops in to show the world the risks of defying the OFN."\n\n"The Americans claim to be free to make and unmake any government in the Americas. How arrogant of them to ignore the sovereignty of any government that vex them." Lott mused. His foreign minister was about to reply when the usual door swing that heralded the vice president let itself be heard.\n\n"President! The Americans, in Guyana, it's terrible! Brazil will not abet this outrageous abuse of our northern brothers. We should declare in strong words... "\n\n"We shouldn't declare anything in strong words!" said Salles. The foreign minister, as usual, was irritated at the vice-president's attempt to tell him how to do his job. "We..."\n\n"Enough, both of you." President Lott stood, preventing another round of bickering. "Let me think." The former military officer walked to the window. His foreign minister would be right to argue that Brazil was in no position to poke the Americans in the eye. Quadros was equally correct to protest unilateral American action.

Unilateral action without regard to sovereignty was a poison among all nations of the world. President Nixon should have reached out to regional actors and partners of the United States such as Brazil. In his closing remarks Lott wished for a new era of cooperation between nations of the continent.\n\nDuring the questions period afterwards, some of Lott's good humor ebbed away. Many of the journalists approved of the president's action, asking if Brazil would move to a more proactive foreign policy. One of the reporters, however, came up with a tricky question. The man asked if President Lott's disapproval of the American intervention meant a lack of interest in South American democracy. The president gruffly replied that he did not support dictatorships, but America had been in the wrong there. Subsequent questions on the topic by the reporter and a few others were parried unconvincingly by Lott.\n\nQuadros recognized the man. A journalist from one of Lacerda's awful newspapers. Slavishly devoted to the Americans. The Vice-President was displeased to see someone attached to his own political party attack Lott on this most auspicious day.

A topic he hammered on was that the American's willingness to oppose tyranny in all its form had done its people and the world much good. Burnham's coup had been illegal. In his role as President Lott hoped to see the concert of nations be one day filled with free countries where men's rights were sacred.\n\nAbsent the conference was Quadros, no doubt sulking about the government's unwillingness to criticize the American intervention. This suited Lott, as it made it easier for him to focus on answering the journalist's questions. Most of them seemed content to support his decision for, after all, use of the military to quash democracy was no science-fiction to Brazilians. Good to know the Americans sometimes did the right thing, having exhausted all other options.\n\nOne journalist asked the president if he would support the Americans deposing any leaders they found offensive. President Lott took a second too long to think, eliciting a wave of photos as he glared at the journalist. "I do not support injustice in any form. Burnham is not free to take his people's rights away, nor would the Americans be free to terminate any government they saw fit."\n\nA weak response. Lott answered the remaining questions as best he could. That journalist was familiar to him. No doubt from one of the right wing scandal rags. "

He loved the campaigning, the rush of energy and excitement he got when he heard cheers at rallys, the countless supporters chanting his name. But working for that long did take the wind out of him.\n\nAs he sat he felt the campaign bus move, moving on to another location of the dozens already canvassed. As he took a hotdog from a passing staffer, he smirked. Campaign buses were relatively a new phenomena in Brazilian politics and he was glad he was able to use personal connections with automobile manufacturers in São Paulo to acquire many buses for affordable prices. The opposition parties had been surprised by Adhemars innovation, supplying PSP candidates nationwide with these buses to fight in the election.

Though on paper the Congresso Nacional appears to be controlled by the Varguist alliance of the PTB and PSD, it is nowhere near as simple as that. As one might expect, there are frontlines, fault-lines and factions enough to make elementary schoolers' playground squabbling seem like a manifestation of student unity by comparison.\n\nIn the Câmara dos Deputados - the lower house - João Goulart, formerly vice-president under Juscelino Kubitschek, was able to garner enough support from the PTB, PSD, PSP, and other minor parties to be elected to the position of President of that chamber.\n\nBut in the Senado, the rightist PSD candidate, Auro de Moura Andrade, not known to be on good terms with Goulart, was the one that became President. Because the PTB, taking advice from Goulart, refused to countenance having him serve as President of the Senate, Auro instead relied upon cross-alliance support from the UDN and other opposition parties.\n\nThis situation, though less than desirable, is probably manageable for President Lott, unless some kind of crisis occurs that would require Auro and Jango to collaborate, which strikes most observers as an unlikely occurrence at best."

"I'm afraid that that is the case, your Excellency. We still have to import supplies from the Italian sphere and the Middle East - from ENI and what have you - and that shows no signs of stopping for the foreseeable future. Twenty years at least is what we're expecting before we can wean ourselves of this."\n\nLott was visibly displeased, though he understood where the man was coming from. "And what if we continue industrializing?"\n\nThe chief financial officer answered this one. "Regrettably, your Excellency, that 'twenty years' figure my colleague found will only get bigger if we keep on industrializing. If we go at the level we've gone during your time in office, sir, it'll probably be forty years; if we go at the level that Senhor Kubitschek did, what with his 'faster-faster-faster' doctrine of industrialization, it might be a full century."\n\nLott shook his head in displeasure.

So much so, in fact, that one might say that Lacerda might have even preferred Getúlio Vargas himself to win the seat, though it would be a colossal blunder to actually claim it to Lacerda's face. Why might one say that? Because at least Vargas, unlike Wilson, wasn't a fascist; everyone - from Henrique Lott to the denizens of Guanabara - knew that Lacerda hated fascism.\n\nThough Lacerda had managed to calm himself down about the matter, his anger that day was reignited by a recent newsflash from one of Wilson's recent speech engagements.\n\n"What? You're telling me that that good-for-nothing German-loving Nazi-aping asshole Wilson wants us to have closer ties with Germany?

She had heard that Brazil was remarkably welcoming to refugees from Germany, but she kept second-guessing her decision.

The Trans-Amazonian Highway crossed a great deal of land. Landholders big and small were of course displeased by the idea of seeing their property cut in two by a great highway through the Brazilian interior. Of course, not everyone had the means to complain about it in the most efficient method.\n\nIn front of Heitor stood a great green map of the next hundred kilometres of the highway, with more holes than the grandest of swiss cheeses. Throughout the map were several dark circles, ellipses, rectangles, and all sorts of other shapes a geometrist could have better named. All land belonging to local bigwigs. Men of great means, and generous hearts. Heitor had received his share of the bribes to make him and others consider accommodating 'local interests'. The highway's path would have to be slightly adjusted. Of course, all this would generate delays, and additional expenses, but what could Heitor do?

There were natives - of the Cinta Larga tribe apparently - that lived in a village in the area; they had probably done so for generations. But one fine morning, the head of the local rubber firm wanted to remove the villagers. He claimed to his goons that the Indians were "parasites, shameful, pests and vagabonds" and resolved to exterminate them. So that is what he did. Brutally. So brutally, in fact, that even some Nazis and Japanese Lott knew of might blanch in horror and disgust.\n\nLott read through the rest of the report. Even he, a military man, well acquainted with death and destruction, could not stand to discuss what he saw about just what had been done to the natives. While one might criticize their supposedly "backwards" culture (though Lott doubted that it really was as "unenlightened" as some might say it was), that kind of treatment was more befitting of the barbarian tyrannies beyond the seas. What horrified him the most was that it had only come out because one of the goons hadn't been paid enough and so decided to run whining to a prosecutor in Cuiabá.\n\nLott resolved himself. This could not be borne. Decisive action had to be taken. Some of his officials objected, but he overruled them. Political considerations were neither here nor there. Justice had to be done."

Distant and lost, the President could see the scars of battle in their eyes. They may be standing here, as national heroes, but only time would tell if their service would be all worth it.\n\nThe roaring of fighter jets snapped Kubitschek out of his wandering thoughts, the airforce flying in formation far above the crowd."

brazil.435.desc: ""Having been elevated to the presidency by the will of the people of Brazil, I can do naught but begin the exercise of this function without thanking the nation for this vote of hope and confidence." So began President Janio Quadros' first speech to the nation. Assembled journalists, still in mild disbelief, stood at attention.\n\n"This mandate rests on twin pillars. The health and morals of Brazil, as well as its relationship to the world. Two pillars whose foundations must be tended to simultaneously. How are we to present ourself to the world, our economy exsanguine from years of profligate spending, our backs burdened by endless debts, our hearts sullied by vice and reprobate actions? And how are we to tend to our own affairs as nations of the world jostle for influence, trampling over the sovereignty of other nations?\n\nThe 20th century has seen the emergence of four worlds. Three of them in the so-called north, the empires of America, Germany and Japan. A fourth one of independent nations, bereft of the prosperity so desired by all of mankind. Unlike the conflicts between the factions of the north, ideological in nature, the economic divide between the north and south is a mere accident of history, an artificial barrier to progress and wealth. This presidency shall look beyond the ideologies of Americanism, Germanism, of Pan-Asianism and anti-colonialism, to seek friendship between our republic and the world, with enmity toward none.\n\nThis independent foreign policy will be nothing but the magnanimous continuation of our domestic policy. A return to a better past will be the building block for a greater future. This government will free itself from the boulder of debts endlessly rolled uphill by the previous administration. Its energies freed from a once sisyphean burden, we will be free to tackle the scourges affecting our nation such as gambling, public immorality and corruption of office holders. May God almighty guide and protect me on the path ahead!""

brazil.436.t: "The Inauguration"
brazil.436.desc: "Carlos Lacerda, President of the Brazilian republic, was very happy today. In fact, now that he had obtained the height of his life's ambitions, he felt safer and happier than he had ever been. Now, rather than having to look over his shoulder in fear all the time, he was free to do everything he had to do in order to bring glory and happiness to Brazil and its people. But of course there was the small matter of the inauguration ceremony to handle.\n\nPleased citizens of Brasília thronged the streets of the city as Lacerda made his way from Brasília Cathedral to the Congresso Nacional. After taking the oath of office - "I promise to preserve, defend and uphold the Constitution, observe the Laws, promote the general welfare of the Brazilian people, and to sustain the union, the integrity and the independence of Brazil" - Lacerda made a brief speech, flanked by many of the previous presidents (though Vargas was, as one might expect, a no-show).\n\n"... My brethren, liberty continues to triumph in our nation. Democracy continues to flourish in our Republic, even though the tyrannies on the other side of the sea have tried their best to throw us down. But there is more work to be done. As your President, I will see this done. I vow - with God Himself as my witness - to strengthen unity, justice, and freedom in this country and in the world, and to bring glory to our great Republic!"\n\nAs the people applauded wildly, Lacerda nodded and continued his speech. It was time to get to work."

At last, thanks be to God and His Mother, Adhemar was free to practice his unique and effective system of governance, for his betterment and that of those who supported him, not to mention that of the Republic and its people. But before that he had to be sworn in and make a speech. And he went about it with aplomb... or so he thought.\n\nEveryone else on the other hand saw an eccentric, almost nonsensical speech that went from religious-traditionalist invective to Brizola-style left-wing rhetoric and populism in two sentences flat. As his rhetoric swung like a pendulum, he took out a Cuban cigar and began to smoke it. The PSP sycophants continued to applaud as he spoke, but even they could not hide their confusion.\n\nIn Olinda, the newly-appointed archbishop, Hélder Câmara, resisted the urge to either lose his mind laughing or fly into a rage as the nearly-incoherent speech wore on. In São Borja, on the other hand, Getúlio Vargas' looked more and more bemused the more came out of Adhemar's mouth. His son Getúlio, sitting next to him, merely shook his head in amusement.\n\nNext to Adhemar, his vice-president, Edna Duffles Lott of the PTB, daughter to the previous president, was directing a funny look at him, not even bothering to disguise her confusion. A journalist observed this and then looked at a friend of his who worked for one of Carlos Lacerda's newspapers. His mouth worked before he was finally able to ask:"

A case in point of this was a story told by Senhor Valdomiro da Silva, now a retired businessman and philanthropist.\n\n'One day, after the dictatorship started, I went to work in Rio as I always did at the time. As you might expect I was kind of nervous, what with all the guns and troops running around. At the time I wasn't as opposed to the prospect of military rule as I became with age, but even then I still couldn't get used to the constant thumping of patrolmen's boots and the occasional shouting of orders by the security troops.\n\nOne time or two I even swung my head around thinking I had been shouted at only to find nothing or some other poor sod being ordered around by the soldiers. Rather than worry about it I just thanked God it hadn't been me and moved on as quickly as I could.\n\nNow one thing really stood out to me on this particular day. I was some hundred or so metres away from my then job, the warehousing company that I later came to own. I almost didn't notice the newspaper on the ground saying "ELECTIONS POSTPONED IMMEDIATELY; CONGRESSO NACIONAL DISMISSED". It took me a good long time to realize just how devastating this was, but for the time being I shrugged and had only one thing to say:'"

Brazil has been lying in wait for a better future, and I have arrived to deliver it. I am proud to have served my country well! The economy has been improved, and political instability decreased. The road is brighter than before!" The senators applauded, and not just out of responsibility; his oration was genuinely powerful.\n\n"Thank you, my men, and thank you, to the people of Brazil, to all that you have done. I am glad that you have elected me to another term!" Murmurs. To so brazenly, openly and publicly rally against the official result; it would cause controversy, and the crowd was uneasy. "My next term comes, and it will deliver even more change! The legacy of Vargas, and all those who support him, will be removed; the stain of Getulism will no longer poison Brazil! Tyranny will be slain!" An audible silence, a gap in breath; not a soul in the room would dare question the man's words.\n\nWordlessly, some senators stood, turning to leave the chamber, backs towards Lacerda. But then, of those who remained, a vanguard began to clap. A standing ovation, which the rest joined in, until all left in the chamber formed a powerful crowd.\n\nIt matters not that some left, Lacerda thought. It matters that most stayed."

The polls were closed, the votes were tallied, and the numbers were on the television. Lacerda had lost.\n\nThe votes had not yet all been counted, but over 90% had, and Lacerda could win a supermajority of the remaining votes and still not win. The election had been lost, it had been settled, and it was clear that Lacerda was defeated. Defeated by a Getulist, a leftist, a fucking crypto-communist! What in hell, what in the FUCK happened?\n\nNo. This couldn't be real. Goulart cheated, of course he did! He stuffed the ballots, he burned the real ones, he bribed the election officials. Brazil's a big country but not big enough to have enough brain-dead idiots that could be fooled into voting for someone as dangerous as Goulart. And he thinks he can get away with it! What a crock of shit!\n\nCarlos sipped his drink. Some alcohol to cool his nerves. He can't get carried away like that, especially considering the trials to come, and what must be done. He looked at the calendar, saw how much time he'd have; about 80 days to inauguration - more precisely 78. Less than 80 days to reverse the fraud. Less than 80 days to save his country.\n\nMore alcohol to calm his nerves, but not enough to dull his wit. It's time to draft a plan. It was time for Lacerda to make  arrangements and preparations for what must be done."

In this country, things like the presidency aren't decided on election day; they're decided between election day and inauguration, and it wouldn't be certain until Goulart was in the office; hell, even then it wasn't sure.\n\nLacerda was sitting by the window of the Palácio da Alvorada, admiring the view. Another beautiful sunset; the red filled the skies, the colors blended, and it was a gorgeous display of all beauty nature had to offer. But it was one day closer to the deadline, to his last days in the palace.\n\nBut he wasn't scared. He was already ready enough. The coup would go smoothly.\n\nCarlos Lacerda thumbed through his notes, one by one. Population centers that needed to be seized. Critical figures in the military, those who were a good enough combination of bribable and powerful to be worth getting to his side. People who would support him even without greased palms. He had moved from a house of cards to a house of brick; it'll take a hell of a lot more than some breath, some talking, to take down what he's built up. And it was ready to go.\n\nOne name caught Lacerda's eyes in this final review. Frota, his trusted middleman, who had already proven well in advancing Lacerda's goals. It was time for him to do a great favor to Lacerda. It was time to talk with the military, and get the guns on his side."

This includes high-up civilian and military officials. The state apparatus of Brazil has been sufficiently swayed to Lacerda's side for a restoration of proper, legitimate governance to be possible without overwhelming backlash.\n\nThrough de jure backing from politicians, and de facto backing from military officials, backed by soldiers loyal to them, a prevention of the inauguration of Goulart as president of Brazil will be executed. Major civilian centers, namely cities important to industry, trade and government, will be intervened in and held by military forces, ensuring important localities will be under Lacerda loyalist control.\n\nThis plan is now in effect.\n\nSIGNED BY CARLOS LACERDA"

Called a coup by many, this has indicated a loss of stability and non-peaceful transfer of power in the state.\n\nMarshall Amaury Kruel has declared allegiance to Lacerda, and has used his troops to seize the city of Brasília, placing the important governmental center under full military control. The result has been both a significant on-the-ground strengthening of Lacerdan forces, swaying the power struggle to his side, and a "falling in line effect" on the other generals of the Brazilian military, who see the way that the wind is blowing, and have decided to be on the side with plenty of guns.\n\nBarricades have been placed in streets, nightly patrols are sweeping neighborhoods, and curfews have been put in effect, as the military is making sure of their control of their cities.\n\nIn an office, somewhere deep in friendly territory, Carlos Lacerda sits behind a desk, looking at Olímpio Mourão Filho, an important general. He stands at attention, shoulders broad, eyes filled with the respect a soldier is obliged to his Commander-in-Chief. There, in the dark room, Lacerda delivers an order."

However, the amount of pro-Lacerda officers has proven to not be enough to properly seize control of the country; the most important cities and resource centers have all stayed in government hands.\n\nTeixeira Lott gives a speech, a great number of officers listening. In it, he tells officers to stay loyal, to the State, to the Constitution, it makes no difference; what matters is to not fall into the Lacerda camp. His words, or perhaps his reputation preceding him, was persuasive enough, and the officers fell into line, and a great deal of the pool of power that Lacerda drew from was completely neutralized, remaining loyal and aligned to the Constitutionalists. The officers side with the state.\n\nAmury Kruel, a key ally of Lacerda, one of the initial supportive figures of the coup, is packing his bags. This wasn't just cowardice, though that may have played a role. It was made clear by the Constitutionalist figures that he was a threat, and it was also made clear that killing him would not be necessary, if he chose to accept a nice sum of money and a permanent vacation outside of Brazil. Naturally, he accepted, bringing with him Lacerda's hopes of a successful coup."

I hear election night didn't go hot for ya. Whaddaya need?"\n\n"Well, you've got two choices; the Brazilian people did too, but they chose wrong, of course. You can have Goulart, or you can have me.

However, the transition towards honest democracy could not be left purely to soldiers and journalists, and certainly not through his pen in Brasília. He had a lot of phone calls to make. A federal republic, as Lacerda's predecessors had wisely created, required federal support, or at least federal disinterest to ensure legitimacy. Even from those the central leadership considered otherwise... undesirable.\n\nTake for example, the honourable governor of São Paulo and spawn of Lacerda's nemesis, Getúlio Vargas Filho. First as tragedy, then as farce, an old, hated voice chimed in. The son was just as much of a bastard and a kleptocrat as the father, though without his admittedly exceptional skill. Still, any imbecile could pose a threat when they also happen to be in charge of one of the most powerful territories in the nation. Doubly so if they believe themselves to have a mandate from the great Brazilian people, a fraudulent election, or the cult of Papa. Concessions would have to be negotiated. Through gritted teeth, perhaps, but negotiations all the same. He might refuse, but Vargas Junior would have the option of Lacerda or the military to negotiate with. Somehow, he doubted the military would offer a better deal.\n\nThe number was dialled, and after a few seconds, the governor of São Paulo picked up."

How could this have happened? After so many years, he had finally come close to ridding Brazil of its taint. Vargas was rotting away in a wheelchair, his successor had been outmaneuvered, and the nation was finally on its way to sensible leadership. But no, old Getúlio had to haunt him from beyond the fucking grave with that waste of sperm son of his. He had been reasonable, he had been polite. He had been hung up on in five seconds, and blasted as a traitor on the radio within five minutes. Him? Called a traitor, an American puppet, a military stooge? By this waste of sperm of the man who had confined Brazil to a savage, dependent wasteland bereaved of talent, culture and honesty?\n\nAnd it seemed the gallant people of Brazil stood behind the bastard. The ungrateful, cloying, useless wastes of a public body! After all he had done to free the land from despotism, a struggle which had continued for decades, but no, the people wanted to laze around on the back of the state, all the while blaming America for their insolence and their indolence! Fuck this. Fuck Brazil. Lacerda was done trying to help people who clearly did not want to help themselves. Let them rot in this stinking pit of human refuse. He stared around the office of the President one last time, thinking of all that could have been in a better world, before instructing Ester to have a helicopter prepared immediately."

An era without strongmen or demagogues could not begin with a speech emulating the hollow promises of a past Lacerda sought to end. A reasonable tone for the speech would set a reasonable tone for the national mood. He began;\n\n"Citizens of Brazil, this is your president speaking. It is my severe displeasure to inform the public of a series of disturbing revelations concerning irregularities which occurred the recent election. The full details have already been made available to the press, and will be published by tomorrow morning.

The intent of Lacerda has been, of course, to give people doubts about the legitimacy of the election, to give him an excuse to seize power back, aided by his various allies, domestic and foreign. Of course, this was predicated on one important thing; people believing him.\n\nAnd people didn't believe him. His doubts were perceived, perhaps correctly, as just a last-ditch attempt to try and keep control of Brazil, and it failed. This has lead to a very undesirable position in Brazil, where two very high profile politicians are both claiming to be the rightful leader of the nation. However, it could be worse; Goulart's clear advantage, and the massive rallies and crowds behind him, paired with his legitimacy through the election, have given him enough power to, at least for now, avoid a civil war; but this may not last forever, and success is far from guaranteed.\n\nInstability rising, and failures mounting, Lacerda is not in a good place at the moment. But he wanted power. He didn't want Brazil to burn. Faced with a loss, he will carry it with him, over the plains and over the oceans, to flee to a far-away place, a place with less failures for him.

No. What Lacerda needs is for there to be enough doubt that the people will stay home, confused, worried, and, most importantly of all, far away from any Goulart rally. And this has been exactly what has happened; despite calls about a coup going on, and pleas to defend democracy, the people have stayed home, out of pro-Lacerda sympathies, out of fear, out of apathy, but they're home.\n\nLacerda sits back in a fine leather chair, a nice import, sipping his drink, also an import.

The beginning step was to get a helicopter, which landed close to his house. The pilot was a close ally whom Lacerda knew he could trust. The helicopter was not his way out; it simply took him away, to a private airstrip, where a private plane was waiting for him. There, he took himself and his possessions onto the private plane, also piloted by a trusted ally. From the plane, he would fly directly to America, where he would be able to safely seek refuge from those who would want to strike back at him for his attempts at power-grabbing.\n\nIn the private plane, thousands of feet above the ground, already hundreds of miles away from his home, Carlos was fuming. Everything has gone to hell, he thought. Nothing has gone as I wanted, and I've done nothing but make everything worse. God damn it. God damn it all to hell!

Nine months after the fact, hospitals and midwives would mark a minor baby boom.\n\nRumours had abounded before the event that the Brazilian team was off their game, untrained and overconfident from their victory in 1958.

Brazilians had once again secured their position as the best athletes in the world. In the moment of victory, all of the nation's strife seemed to disappear.\n\nHighway workers, every crew packed around their own singular radio, rejoiced. Navy ships echoed with cheers, businessmen threw extravagant parties, even the men in Brazil's highest offices allowed themselves a day to celebrate. More than a few gunshots went off, and barely any of the fireworks were legally owned. In those hours of victory, Brazil was united, if only for a while. "

 POLITICS_JANIO_QUADROS_DESC: "Known as \"The Man who swept Brazil,\" Jânio Quadros is a unique figure within the Brazilian political system and has reached heights that many said he would never achieve. Born in Mato Grosso but raised in Curitiba, he would later move to São Paulo and study Law. Quadros entered politics in 1947, a man who disliked the Estado Novo regime for its growing authoritarianism, deciding to dedicate himself against it. With the collapse of the Estado Novo in 1949, Quadros was ecstatic believing that he himself had delivered a major blow to the regime and it deepened his passion for politics.\n\nHe would continue his career in politics, becoming a well known anti-corruption crusader who claimed to fight against corruption in all forms in Brazil. While he won the mayorship of São Paulo, he lost the governorship race by one percentage vote against Adhemar de Barros. However, this did not stop him and he declared he would persevere and sweep away corruption with a broom.\n\nIn 1960 he ran for the Vice Presidency of Brazil on a combined ticket of many political parties, including the PTN, UDN and PDC, plus other minor ones. In this election, Quadros outperformed his presidential running mate and reached the heights of the Vice-Presidency. Had it not been for the man to win the Presidency, Henrique Teixeira Lott, Quadros would have probably been able to have his way in pursuing whatever path he felt like pursuing, but instead he finds himself every day in a constant tug-of-war with Lott for domination over the other, which has so far prevented him from enacting most of his promises.\n\nHe has maintained his exhibitionist, dramatic and demagogic ways, annoying many who say Quadros will, in the end, fail to implement his plans. But he continues, ever stubbornly, to say that he will erradicate the corruption of the Brazilian State or die trying..." #remind me to fix this after the teaser -oveja
 POLITICS_TEIXEIRA_LOTT_DESC: "Henrique Teixeira Lott, the 22nd President of Brazil is in his heart still a military man. Lott developed his military career over the span of four decades. Not through nepotistic appointments, but using skill.\n\nWith the entry of Brazil into the Second World War, Lott was sent as a military attaché to America. However, history would force Lott deeper into the war. With the German invasion of Britain, Lott would work closely with Field Marshal Mascarenhas de Morais in commanding the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. Yet despite their best efforts, the island would fall and Brazil was forced to retreat. Lott would be promoted for his efforts, becoming a Brigadier General, and praised as a war hero. Lott worked on plans to defend Brazil from outside invasion, maintaining his ties to the Americans. As the Estado Novo regime fell in 1949, Lott would be one of those standing among Vargas' close circle of advisers. Deciding to act instead of going with his arms crossed, Lott proved instrumental in reaching an agreement that guaranteed elections would be held and Vargas was unharmed. He was personally involved in making sure that this agreement was maintained as he warned radical members of the military to allow the transition of power to occur.\n\nLott would be the minister of war throughout the fifties for both Eduardo Gomes and Juscelino Kubitschek's government. Lott, known for his dedication, stopped a coup attempt in 1955 ensuring that Brazilian democracy would survive and prosper. In 1960 Lott himself ran for the presidency, winning under the banner of the PSD. Lott now leads the largest nation in South America, however, Lott is still a General at heart, not a politician. Issues that plague Brazil, such as rampant inflation, he has been unable to deal with effectively. This combined with the fact that Jânio Quadros won the Vice-Presidency, a man with very different ideas for Brazil than Lott, turns governing into a challenge just as big as the wars that Lott fought in."
 POLITICS_Joao_Goulart_DESC: "João Goulart knows the political establishment dislikes him, but he doesn't care. Born in the rural south, Goulart became a skilled businessman and gained a passion for swimming and football. Goulart almost didn't enter politics, considering a career in football. This dream was shattered due to Goulart's bohemian lifestyle and catching syphilis, causing paralysis in his left knee that never healed. Goulart entered a depression, where he lacked a vision for what he would do. Seeing how the poor were treated throughout Brazil, he decided that he would fix this."\n\nGoulart thrust himself into politics, meeting with Vargas himself and joining the PTB. He used his personal wealth to support his political ambitions and ran for the Chamber of Deputies and gained a seat. During his campaigning, he met two important figures. Leonel Brizola a key political ally and a good friend, and his future wife Maria Thereza. With Brizola, each rose rapidly in the PTB and took control of it.\n\nWhen Kubitschek approached the PTB for a political alliance in the 55 elections and Goulart to be his running mate, Goulart accepted. With the victory, the PTB's influence and power grew. Goulart ran with Henrique Lott for the '60 elections, but was stopped by Jânio Quadros who narrowly won the election for Vice President. After a brief depressive period, Maria convinced Goulart to run in the Chamber of Deputies, where he would win the election and become its leader.\n\nGoulart's career has reached its inevitable end, the presidency. His drive and ambition has not stopped and he has remained a humble man, wanting to aid the poor. With Brizola, Edna Lott and others by his side, Goulart aims to build a better Brazil for all Brazilian's. However enemies are everywhere and they wish to destroy Goulart, but Goulart knows that he can not fail. For the good of Brazil and the good of the poor, he must not fail."
 POLITICS_Humberto_Castelo_Branco_DESC: "What goes through the mind of a man who has betrayed an oath, does he feel guilt or does he justify it, for Castelo Branco the answer is both. Born to a rich army family, it was only natural that he would eventually join the army as well, joining in 1918. A skilled soldier shown by him placing first in his class of the General staff school, Humberto rose throughout his career gaining promotions due to skill not nepotism.\n\nIn Second World War, Humberto was a part of the Brazilian expeditionary force and was involved in the British campaign. Commanding troops and planning battles, Humberto showed great skill. But skill wasn't enough and Brazil would be defeated and forced to retreat. This is what created a sense of disdain for fascism in Humbertos eyes, too many good Brazilian soldiers had died to fascism. With an already deep dislike of communism, Humberto would fight against both when he returned to Brazil.\n\nWith the birth of the fourth republic, Humberto worked with Lott in the early part of the republic. Supporting Lott's efforts to ensure the inauguration of Kubitschek took place. It would only be later when Lott was being hailed by communists and perfidious trade unionists as a savior, that Humberto turned against Lott. His leadership of the Sorbonne faction drove a deeper wedge between the two, and their relationship would be destroyed by his leadership of the military coup after the 100 days of chaos."
 POLITICS_Adhemar_de_Barros_DESC: "Adhemar de Barros is a politician of contradictions, a populist that uses left-wing language but gets along with elites. A man who can connect with the working class but is highly educated and rich. A playful populist but a great planner. Adhemar is not a man whose ideology can be fit into one box, thus he is called an 'Adhemarist' a man whose only ideology is what is best for Adhemar."\n\nBorn in a family of traditional coffee farmers, Adhemar quickly rose. Graduating with a degree of medicine in 1923. He traveled to Europe and America becoming an aviator and learning multiple languages. He stopped practicing after the constitutionalist revolution of 1932 where he fought for his state, when his state lost he traveled to Paraguay and fought with them as a doctor in the Chaco war. He would return to Brazil and became a state deputy in São Paulo, until Vargas instituted his Estado Novo regime and closed the legislative houses down.\n\nHowever this was not the end of his political career, Adhemar became an intervener in São Paulo and helped govern the state. From this point on, São Paulo and Adhemars destinies were tied as Adhemar advanced his career in São Paulo. He has been governor of the state three times and when he hasn't his political control of the state has still been strong. He has also run for the Presidency twice before, in 1955 and 60, each attempt gaining more than the last, and now Adhemar has succeeded, he is President.\n\nAllegations of corruption, nepotism, bribery and other crimes can sink other politicians. Adhemar has had hundreds of accusations but none have sunk them. In fact he has turned them into a weapon against his critics. Yes he may steal, but he delivers. He has bet that the people of Brazil want someone corrupt who does work, than one who does nothing. So far he has been right."
 POLITICS_Carlos_Lacerda_DESC: "If you had told Lacerda in 1940 where he would be in 20 years he would have stated that you were a lying fascist. Despite this Lacerda would eventually become what he once hated most, a conservative. The child of left-wingers, Lacerda too was a communist in his youth and early adulthood. He turned against the idea after Germany destroyed the Soviet Union. Lacerda blamed the ideology of communism for the victory of the Germans in the Second World War. This disillusionment caused Lacerda to search for an ideology that would give Brazil a strong foundation, he settled on Social conservatism and economic liberalism.\n\nFollowing the war, he became one of Vargas' arch-nemesis, founding the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa to attack Vargas. For this Lacerda became known as the anti-Getúlio and was one of the main factors for the fall of Vargas, with the fallout of an attempted assassination on Lacerda being the final straw for the regime.\n\nLacerda became a strong supporter of Eduardo Gomes and joined the UDN, seeing this as the party that would build a stronger Brazil. The victory of the Kubitschek/Goulart ticket in 1955 was a direct threat to the future of Brazil in Lacerdas eyes. He joined the plot of 55 to prevent their inauguration. While this failed and he was let go with a slap on the wrist, Lacerda continued to scheme and was a fierce opponent of Kubitschek, Goulart, and then Lott, working with Quadros and Adhemar in alliances of convenience to attack their enemies.\n\nThe position of Governor of Guanabara was merely a stepping stone to his actual ambition which he has fulfilled, the presidency of Brazil. With this position, Lacerda will not fail as his predecessors have, he will create a strong Brazil to resist totalitarianism or he will die trying."
 POLITICS_Juscelino_Kubitschek_DESC: "The life of Kubitschek is what he describes as the dream of Brazil, to rise from a poor family to the Presidency itself. Raised by his mother, due to his father dying from tuberculosis while JK was two. JK would persevere, gaining an education and later becoming a  licensed medical doctor. In 1930 he would travel around Europe, missing the events of the revolution that occurred in 1930 cementing Vargas' rise to power. Once news of this arrived, JK traveled back to Brazil and on his arrival asked his future wife, Sarah Kubitschek to marry him.\n\nKubitschek entered into politics in Minas Gerias and advanced quickly. He became known for his professional nature and his signature infrastructure and architecture programs. It would be during this time period where he had a child Marcia in 1943 and adopted another Maria in 1947. He also met the architect Oscar Niemeyer that he would cooperate closely with.\n\nAs the war ended JK supported Vargas to the very end being a key ally that Vargas could rely on. With the restoration of democracy, he decided to carry on Vargas' legacy and ran for the legislature in the PSD. He became a popular figure and was the PSD candidate for the 1955 elections. He negotiated with the PTB and João Goulart to run on a joint ticket and support each other. JK won a decisive victory and with Lott's help stopped an attempted coup.\n\nPresident Kubitschek focused on infrastructure programs and the construction of Brasília using the architect Oscar to design the city. He promised 50 years of progress in five and to the PSD and many Brazilians, he achieved it. Now President again, Kubitschek promises another decade of progress in a few years. However his ambition may be more than he can achieve within the few years he has, and certain business in Rio distracts him from the political sphere in Brasília."
 POLITICS_Auro_de_Moura_Andrade_DESC: "Auro Andrade, hated by the center, right and left due to his actions, but a political giant in his own right. The son of the king of Cattle Antônio, Auro first entered the political sphere in the constitutionalist revolt of 1932 and after continued it becoming an enemy of the Vargas government with his charismatic speeches and business connections. With Vargas' fall and the birth of the Fourth Republic, Auro ran for senator of São Paulo and has remained in the Senate since.\n\nWhen he woke up one day and saw a letter with the words Be prepared on it, Auro was ready for what was to come. What followed next was a shock to nearly everyone in Brazil but not to Auro, the resignation of Lott, and Auro working against both Quadros and Goulart to become President. An unprecedented act from a so-called moderate center of the Senate. But to Auro to allow either Quadros or Goulart to become President would be dooming Brazil to either incompetence or communism. Auro saw himself as the one man who could stop this and he did.\n\nAuro seized the moment and while Brazil has fallen into chaos, Auro believes that a better Brazil will be forged out of these fires. Or at least a Brazil where Quadros or Goulart are not President. Despite the hatred thrown at him, Auro continues his current actions. The senate and nation is too divided to remove him, and soon they will be out of time to stop him."

 BRA_pl_bill_desc_1: "One of the major factors that exacerbates the current energy crisis in Brazil is the fact that a substantial fraction of the electrical infrastructure is owned by foreign corporations. Poorer and rural citizens bear the brunt of this injustice. This bill will nationalize these electrical corporations in order to provide electricity at low cost to the people."

 BRA_pl_bill_desc_2: "Our Republic is supposedly "democratic", but there is very good reason to doubt this when the illiterate, low-ranking military officers, and other marginalized groups are denied the vote. Accordingly, in order to promote the interests of democracy, this bill will expand the franchise to all Brazilian citizens without exception."

 BRA_pl_bill_3: "§QThe African Surge Resolution§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_3: "The war against the Reichskommissariate in southern Africa continues to rage; the conflict with the three German colonial tyrannies is nowhere near over. It is clear to any observer that additional support will be required if we are to drive the so-called "Aryan master race" back from the South African border. This law will send more reinforcements to the frontier so as to ensure that the Hitlerites are driven back."

 BRA_pl_bill_4: "§QThe Unwavering Torch Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_4: "In light of the unprecedented German aggression witnessed in South Africa and other places in the last two years, Brazil must find allies; the Americans and their Organization of Free Nations could not be better candidates for this. This bill gives the legislatures support and consent and thus arranges for Brazil's immediate admittance to the Organization of Free Nations as a full member."

 BRA_pl_bill_5: "§YThe Highway to Prosperity Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_5: "The Trans-Amazonian Highway connecting Brazil to its hinterlands and to the rest of South America has languished for lack of resources and funding since the fall of the Lott government. This bill will restore the lost funding and provide more money with a view on seeing the project through to completion. Whatever is required, Brazil will provide."
 
 BRA_pl_bill_6: "§KAn Act to Withdraw Forces from South Africa§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_6: "Brazilian blood has been shed on South African soil for a useless proxy boxing match between America and Germany. Ships and ships of Brazil's youth and treasures have been sent east, to no return. No more. This act, proposed by President Quadros, will bring our boys home from the lawless hellhole of Africa and save them from having to play the catspaw for America. As the act to enter South Africa was passed overwhelmingly by Congress, Quadros must ensure a act to ensure Brazil withdrawal from South Africa can also pass. Otherwise he will lack the legislatures approval and consent to do so. While Quadros could just ignore the legislature, arguing directly to the supreme court that they have no authority over foriegn policy, it would be best to pass this bill through the legislature to prevent any unneeded political battles."

 BRA_pl_bill_7: "§KThe Lott Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_7: "This bill will once and for all prevent armed forces interference in Brazilian politics by setting new ground rules for military officers and harshly enforcing the rules already on the books to kick politics out of the armed forces and protect democracy in the Republic of Brazil. If it goes through, the Constitutionalists in our military will finally be empowered to help ensure our military fully embraces its rightful role of "uniformed civilians" and nothing more or less."

 BRA_pl_bill_8: "§KThe Agrarian Relief Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_8: "This bill aims to begin the process of agrarian reform. We will redistribute land from inefficient, money-gorged landowners such as ranchers and hand it over to more deserving people - smallholders, peasants - who know the land more intimately and are better-placed to make sure it prospers. The bill also has emergency relief and loans to ensure the agriculutural sector does not suffer but continues to grow and improve. This will also hopefully also put an end to the protests currently paralyzing our country."

 ## Lott-Quadros Mechanic
 BRA_lottquadros_category: "Lott-Quadros Power Struggle"
 # BRA_lottquadros_category_description: "Following the 1960 Presidential elections, the office of President and Vice-President were held by two differing tickets. The President's office held by §KTeixeira Lott§!, supported by the §YPSD§! and §VPTB§!. The Vice-President's is held by §QJânio Quadros§! supported by numerous right-wing, chiefly being the §QUDN§!, and other smaller parties. Their differences have caused tension between the two over the course of the term. While both have promised to work effectively with the other, what has instead developed is a power struggle between the two with both candidates wishing to push forward their agenda with what power they have. The power struggle over influence will continue, as long as the two continue to conflict over policies and their political and personal relationship change, for better or for worse."

BRA_military_elections.1.t: "The Crow's Head Start"
BRA_military_elections.1.desc: "A military spokesperson announced today on television the beginning of election season for the Presidential and Vice-Presidential offices, which would conclude in 135 days. While many breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Brazil's democracy would still live on, the real truth of the elections had begun manifesting itself several weeks ago.\n\nThe military, in order to ensure that a leftist candidate could never see power again, began extensive preparations. Candidates throughout Brazil were denied from running for office. In their place were various candidates that people had never heard of before, nor seen in their community, but people knew better than to ask questions. For some reason, there were a large amount of candidates running for various offices, but no matter the district, there was always only one UDN candidate running in a crowded field. While everyone else offered confusing and conflicting messages, UDN candidates offered a unified vision, and voters were flocking to that in far greater numbers. Carlos Lacerda, the presidential candidate for the UDN, was polling around 20 points above within just a week of election season.\n\nThe blatant subversion was not lost on the former President of the Republic, Juscelino Kubitschek. On one hand, he was grateful that the military even allowed him to run in the first place. On the other hand, it was purely for show and, he thought, a waste of his time. But he realized that there was nothing standing between the UDN and a dictatorial, one-party state except for him. If the military wanted a fight during election season, well, they'll get it from the former President. Just because the odds were stacked against him, doesn't mean that he shouldn't try. They told him the same when he wanted to build Brasília, and he didn't listen. Both men knew the stakes at hand."

BRA_military_elections.5.desc: "A win, a loss, a win, a loss, rinse and repeat. The votes kept landing on Kubitschek's lap in thick sheafs, each conveying an identical conclusion in consistently novel permutations: he and Lacerda were even. For hours he watched the numbers scramble over each other, climbing higher and higher to decide the election in a seemingly endless flurry of papers and figures until Tancredo Neves gripped his shoulder.\n\nThe counting had stopped. Kubitschek had won.\n\nHis nervous grin shifted into a radiant smile, the President-elect constricted Neves in a fulsome hug. "A chance in Hell was all I needed!" Kubitschek chimed, and the two advanced into the cheering throng of their supporters. Members of the congressional caucus, old and new, cut through to shake Kubitschek's hand, but he ignored their attempts at endearment and hurriedly took to the celebrations.\n\nKubitschek was not alone in his jubilation, his enthusiasm had spread to all corners of Brazil. Hundreds of thousands sang in the streets, drowning out the fulminations of Lacerda's supporters. The anguish, the joy, the clashes and the fights mixed into a great national noise, but the songs of the Republic cut through it all.\n\nExhausted and only slightly drunk, Kubitschek and Neves trained their eyes on the television's election coverage, the only unblemished surface in the vandalized party room. "Some of them are saying it's rigged," Neves slurred. The President-elect flashed a big, stupid grin.\n\n"They know that, that's why they voted for me!""

BRA_military_elections.6.t: "Carlos Lacerda, Spirit of Prometheus"
BRA_military_elections.6.desc: "The numbers kept coming and Lacerda was still in front. He took little comfort from it. What could Kubitschek pull, how could he still win? A knot of schemes meant nothing to him, he'd follow after Alexander and cut through it with a sword of optimistic charm. Campaigning against him was like catching smoke. Beating him, to Lacerda, was the same.\n\nAppropriately, he followed after the Greeks, and stole the fire.\n\nThe new PSD candidates had dragged Kubitschek down. Where they had sprung, he hemorrhaged votes, and Lacerda barreled in front further until the final tally arrived and it seemed as if the PSD had never contested some areas at all. The UDN had won! Lacerda had won!\n\n"We got him!" Lacerda yelled. His caucus met his cry with booming cheers and full glasses, and they caroused to the symphony of clinking glass and televised celebrations. Lacerda's supporters flooded the streets in the tens of thousands, the uncommon throng of protestors trailing after them with placards held high, but their noise dissipated as the day went.\n\nFrom his own uninvolving conversation, Lacerda took notice of the television. A sprinting cameraman struggled to keep a brawl in frame, a clash between his and Kubitschek's supporters - a blemish on a great day. Lacerda smiled and abandoned the droning of a functionary for the company of his advisors."

BRA_military_elections.8.desc: "The Brasília garrison was aflame. News had just reached them that Juscelino Kubitscheck's presidential convoy had suffered a bomb attack on the way to his inauguration, and the President-elect himself was dead. One colonel yammered on about "those spineless politicians that had failed the nation". The officers saw the country as leaderless and paralyzed. Finally, they decided that the troops should march to the Monumental Axis and seize the Presidential Palace and Congress.\n\nReports of Juscelino's death spread like wildfire, and by the time the garrison marched, protestors had already taken to the streets and gathered between the Ministries' buildings, fiercely opposing the local police, even as checkpoints were set up all across major avenues. Repression increased for the better part of the afternoon, and clashes with protestors grew more violent by the hour. The garrison's officers stood confused when a heavily armed convoy showed itself and dumbfounded when Marshal Castelo Branco himself stepped out of an armored car, with a noticeably shaken, but still alive and unharmed, President-elect Juscelino Kubitscheck by his side.\n\n"Who is in command here?", questioned the Marshal, with the disapproving tone he was known for. No one came forward. "I will not ask again. No orders came from my office and none of my fellow generals approved this. This farce is an affront to the Armed Forces' authority. President Juscelino is alive and well, as all may see, and the lot of you will be brought into custody for insubordination."\n\nDemoralized, the garrison surrendered. Castelo Branco's troops dispersed the protestors, and preparations for Juscelino's inauguration could finally begin. The ceremony took place in the Senate, where Juscelino vowed to reinstate an age of stability, promising Order and Progress for the people of Brazil, with guidance from the Armed Forces."

BRA_military_elections.9.t: "Inauguration from Safety"
BRA_military_elections.9.desc: "President "elect" Carlos Lacerda was waiting on the back seat of the Presidential Rolls Royce inside the Brasilia Air Force Base, being kept there for his own protection as the city devolved into chaos. A general strike had been declared, and a million workers were on the streets of every major city. Talk on the base was that would be one more attempt by the Communist Party and their fellow travelers in the PTB, led by Brizola and Goulart, to destabilize the upcoming Presidency and their military allies, paving the way for the takeover of Brazil.\n\nThe Air Force's helicopters circled around the city, looking for suspects as the Military Police cavalry charged upon protesters blocking the way to the presidential palace, clearing the barricades while infantry soldiers were deployed to the Monumental Axis to try to restore control of the city.\n\nGeneral Castelo Branco brought the news to President Lacerda: There were just not enough troops to guarantee the safety of the Presidential Motorcade. He was to be inaugurated at the Brasilia Air Force base while they waited for reinforcements to arrive.\n\nLacerda was furious at the news, but he knew he had nothing to do. As he was being inaugurated, surrounded by military officers, Lacerda thought about Kubischeck and the construction of Brasilia. He had criticized him when he was building this city, but deep down, he knew that he wouldn't survive a riot like this in Rio."

Lott takes the helm of a country faced with problematic levels of inflation and growing debt, among other problems that are doubtless on the way. While Lott has had many successes as a general, the people of Brazil hope that he will have the same luck as President."
 BRA_expand_petrobras: "Expand Petrobras"
 BRA_expand_petrobras_desc: "Petrobras is Brazil's state-run oil company, granted a legal monopoly by Juscelinio Kubitschek. Its slogan is 'Oil is Ours', and it claims to put oil to use for the benefit of the Republic and its people. In reality, few if any Brazilians have seen any real profit from the vast "black gold" reserves of Brazil. To President Lott, the answer to this travesty is clear. Petrobras must be given significant government funding and assistance so they can expand further. This will equip them to deliver the profits of Brazilian oil to the Brazilian people, as was always their right and due. Then Petrobras will be able to live up to its slogan and the oil truly will be 'ours'."
 BRA_open_brasilia: "Open Brasília"
 BRA_open_brasilia_desc: "Juscelino Kubitschek's greatest work, the construction of the city of Brasília, is at last completed. Constructed in just four years, this great city will serve as the new capital of the Republic of Brazil. This act, the transformation of an empty savannah plain into a masterpiece of modern urbanism and architecture, shows the greatness and strength of our Brazilian nation. President Lott and Vice-President Quadros will officially open the city and its congress. We will also invite ex-President Kubitschek and the architects who supervised the project to the opening to thank them on behalf of the Republic for their diligence and devotion."
 BRA_american_investors: "American Investors"
 BRA_american_investors_desc: "The Brazilian economy is closely tied to that of the 'Land of the Free' in the north. Many large American companies and conglomerates have substantial operations in Brazil and we receive millions of American investment dollars every year. The previous government of President Kubitschek alternated between investor-friendly policies and limited nationalisations; this was sufficient to keep American investment at a constant, high level.\n\nOn the other hand, Lott believes strongly in the benefits of attracting American capital to Brazil and will do whatever it takes (within reason of course) to make Brazil even more attractive to American investors than it already is."
 BRA_japanese_tech: "Japanese Technology"
 BRA_japanese_tech_desc: "In recent years, technology in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, especially in the Empire of Japan, has begun to advance by leaps and bounds. Japanese researchers and engineers are designing and producing all kinds of devices in all industries which improve efficiency, productivity, and profitability. If we can obtain these new, cutting-edge technologies and put them to good use, it will be a great boon for the Brazilian economy. Accordingly, under the guidance of President Lott, we will begin the process of importing limited quantities of Japanese technology through various trustworthy intermediaries. This will further our industrial development and assist in construction of new, modern infrastructure throughout Brazil."
 BRA_construct_the_highway: "Construct the Highway"
 BRA_construct_the_highway_desc: "Having secured American investment and Japanese technology, Lott is now ready to reveal the great economic ambition of his presidential career. The President has made plans for a Rodovia Transamazônica - a Trans-Amazonian Highway - to be constructed. This is to be a corridor that will cut directly through the Amazon as far as the distant borders with Colombia and Peru. This highway would be the first of its kind - a direct land route connecting Brazil and western South America.\n\nLott's plan is endorsed by his own party. Even better, it has also found support among many politicians of the UDN. Among these is Vice-President Quadros himself; he has personally endorsed the idea. However, others are skeptical. They wonder how Lott's optimism and plans will fare against the heavy rain, disease, pests, and humid heat that bedevil the Amazon Rainforest. But Lott dismisses these detractors: if the Germans could dam the Mediterranian, the Brazilians can breach the Amazon. Accordingly, the plans having been made and the material having been prepared, the march to the West can begin."
 BRA_end_coffee_strikes: "End the Coffee Strikes"
 BRA_end_coffee_strikes_desc: "Out of all coffee-producing nations on Planet Earth, Brazil is at once King and Emperor. We produce the most coffee in the world, which allows us to provide supply to world markets from Anchorage to Auckland. However, this means that the revenue from coffee exports is a vital part of the Brazilian economy, and if the coffee industry is disrupted, all Brazil is disrupted with it. This fact makes the ongoing coffee-industry strikes all the more worrisome. If these disturbances are allowed to continue without resolution, the coffee industry and by extension Brazil's entire economy will suffer. Lott cannot and will not allow this to happen - he will issue a decree ordering an end to the strikes and meet with police chiefs, union leaders, and other stakeholders to discuss potential options. The strikes will come to an end by hook or by crook."
 BRA_end_the_marches: "End Their Marches"
 BRA_end_the_marches_desc: "With the police at maximum readiness and the army on standby, it is now time to put an end to the marches these strikers hold. Putting a stop to the marches will cause sympathy for the strikes to slowly fade and be replaced with frustration at a lack of progress. Lott has ordered the ground forces to blockade major streets and thoroughfares with tanks so as to prevent the marches from proceeding too far from their starting points. He hopes that the frustration that being unable to keep marching causes will break the strikers' wills and incentivize them to prefer negotiations to continued strike action."
 BRA_more_concessions: "A Few Concessions"
 BRA_more_concessions_desc: "Henrique Lott is not an unreasonable man. Even if he was, as President he is still beholden to his party, and the PTB has made it clear that problems in the coffee industry must be addressed. Thus, the President and his charismatic daughter, Edna Lott, will meet with strike leaders and offer them concessions. On the list of proposed concessions are increased wages, fewer working hours, and longer vacations. Lott will offer an improvement on their situation but prevent a substantial change; this will avoid frustrating the plantation owners. With his daughter by his side, helping him every step of the way, Lott has every reason to believe that the strikes will end through diplomacy and compromise and not in further conflict."
 BRA_back_to_work: "Back to Work"
 BRA_back_to_work_desc: "With a combination of negotiation and strike-disrupting tactics, making use of both handshakes and tanks, the unions have stopped their strikes. The strikers have gone back to work, and the coffee has once again begun to flow. Brazil's title as Coffee Emperor is once again secured for the foreseeable future. Lott leans back in his chair and takes a sip from his coffee, relaxing after a job well done. The PTB may complain and his daughter may say they didn't do enough to help the strikers, but politics is about compromise, not crowd-pleasing. From what Lott himself can see, though many aren't over the moon with the results, almost everyone can tolerate them, and a significant portion are pleased. That there is the definition of a very successful compromise."
 BRA_emergency_budget_cuts: "Emergency Budget Cuts"
 BRA_emergency_budget_cuts_desc: "With the immediate crises dealt with, Lott has turned his attention towards the economy. Here, the responsible minister Senhor Tancredo Neves has informed us of the existence of a few problems. Inflation, debt, and slowing economic growth all pose a threat to our prosperity; needless to say, if these are not dealt with, the President will have significant difficulties pushing through the rest of his plans for the Republic. Lott has implemented minor budget cuts as an emergency stopgap measure to deal with the debt and seconded Neves to tackle the inflation problem. The issue of economic growth will hopefully be resolved through the implementation of Lott's industrialization programs."
 ## Operation Lobster ##
 BRA_Fireworks_in_Rio: "Fireworks in Rio"
 BRA_Fireworks_in_Rio_desc: "A year has passed, and Lott has gotten a lot of work done: opening Brasília, managing the economy, beginning the construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway, and dealing with the coffee strikes. After all this work, Lott is exhausted and needs a break; the New Year celebrations present the perfect opportunity for this.\n\nWhile others throng the streets, celebrating another year passed without nuclear annihilation and sharing their hope that the Hawaiian Missile Crisis will continue to deescalate, Lott will spend it in his study, taking a well-deserved rest. Let Quadros and Neves take care of the government for just this week. Then it will be back to work for the old general."
 BRA_operation_lobster: "Operation Lobster"
 BRA_operation_lobster_desc: "For the past few years, we have had to deal with what the press has dubbed the 'Lobster War'. Our territorial waters are subject to continuous incursions by African pirates, foreign merchant boats and German warships.\n\nOur local fishermen are harassed and their livelihoods suffer while wealthy vultures in the so-called 'Capital of the World' feast on our lobster. Just recently, a Japanese couple was taken hostage by pirates, resulting in a major diplomatic crisis. Lott has declared he will end this war: no more will German naval craft violate our waters, no more will African fishers steal our lobster.\n\nTo this end, Lott has arranged a meeting with Admiral Arnoldo Toscano to promise him the ships and resources he needs. In return, he asks for one guarantee from the Admiral: that he will make Brazil victorious in this conflict."
 BRA_Deploy_the_Flotilla: "Deploy the Flotilla"
 BRA_Deploy_the_Flotilla_desc: "Admiral Toscano has asked for a task force and Lott has given him one, now it just needs to be deployed. The task force will quickly be stationed in the waters off the coast of Pernambuco, where the fishing violations are at their worst. There, Arnoldo will ensure the task force destroys any pirate ships they see and sends rogue fishing craft back to Africa. This intervention will take some pressure off of the administration, but the fishermen will be back. While Arnoldo deals with the immediate problems, it is up to Lott and Quadros to think of a more permanent solution to the Lobster War."
 BRA_Anti_Piracy_Operations: "Anti Piracy Operations"
 BRA_Anti_Piracy_Operations_desc: "For a good while now we have had to deal with pirates and fishermen coming from the anarchic coast of West Africa and engaging in illegal fishing and a thousand other kinds of criminal enterprise within our maritime borders. They profit from these ventures and get away with it, but we get blamed whenever something goes wrong. The recent incident involving Japanese tourists is a sign of what could come. If we want to prevent further disruptions of this kind, we must wipe this piracy out completely."
 BRA_Work_With_the_Governments: "Work With the Governments"
 BRA_Work_With_the_Governments_desc: "Vice-President Jânio Quadros' idea is to work with the local governments that are emerging from the aftermath of the West African Anarchy. He believes that, now that the 'superior Aryan master race' is busy bleeding itself white, the native Africans and other assorted remnants now coming out of their shelters and hidey-holes will jump at any opportunity to reëstablish friendly contact with comparatively civilized 'non-Aryans'. Accordingly, we can send our foreign minister Walter Salles to the recently-reestablished authorities such as the Republic of Liberia with an offer, we'll send them money and aid if they nip the pirate issue in the bud within their own borders."
 BRA_A_Deal_With_the_Free_France: "A Deal With the Free French"
 BRA_A_Deal_With_the_Free_France_desc: "General Charles de Gaulle and the Free French need weaponry; how will they achieve their precious pipe dream of liberating Paris and France without guns and artillery? We can send them an offer. We'll help them with their arms shortage if they put their outdated boats and ships to harass and suppress the pirates. It is a win-win situation for both of us: they get the weapons they desperately need, and we don't have to deal with the pirates ourselves. Let us just hope that Charles de Gaulle, his mind frayed after years of failed struggle, will still be able to see reason."
 BRA_Search_and_Destroy: "Search and Destroy"
 BRA_Search_and_Destroy_desc: "Admiral Arnoldo's plan is to put our own local task forces to use to suppress these illegal fishermen and pirates ourselves. He advises us to move at once to search and destroy the illegal craft until they are no longer a threat, rather than waste precious time and effort negotiating with bombed-out villages, camel-riding tribesmen, and crazed resistance fighters who cannot admit defeat. Lott has decided, on the advice of his Minister of War, to take up the Admiral's plan and ignore that offered by Vice-President Quadros. We shall defeat the pirates as we have been doing already, with fire and steel."
 BRA_Send_Them_Back: "Send Them Back"
 BRA_Send_Them_Back_desc: "The next part of our plan is simple: send the pirates back to West Africa. Once they are back in their homelands, there will be no problem. Furthermore, we can save ourselves from having to spend any more on these nuisances than the value of a plane ticket. This is an easy and efficient process; if these people have brains they'll know better than coming back into (and getting blown out of) our waters a second time. And if they don't learn the first time, well, beatings (and gunfire if necessary) will be more than sufficient to cure such disorders."
 BRA_The_Pirates_Scattered: "The Pirates Scattered"
 BRA_The_Pirates_Scattered_desc: "No matter what course of action we have taken, whether we fought with well-placed words or with good strong steel, we have succeeded in our task. The pirates are mostly defeated and scattered; instances of illegal fishing, though still significant, have begun to decrease. Most important of all, our fishermen can return to work with the danger to their livelihood significantly reduced. Our task forces will of course patrol the areas for the next few months, but their job will be far easier from here on in. As for us, having caught or killed the smaller members of the food chain, it is now time for us to deal with the big predators."
 BRA_Stop_the_Companies: "Stop the Companies"
 BRA_Stop_the_Companies_desc: "While the African Fishermen and Pirates are a problem, a greater problem still is posed by the German Reichskomissariate and the corporations that run amok within their lands. Large fishing trawlers from the RKs - primarily Siegfried Müller's Zentralafrika - frequently intrude in Brazilian waters to fish illegally and sell what they get to gluttons and gourmands all across the world. They put these illegal gains to use to finance their terrible colonial governments that grind human beings to dust in order to perpetuate the deluded superiority of their imaginary 'Aryan race'. If we are to attain final victory in the Lobster War we must pressure either the RKs or the corporations into no longer continuing to violate our territorial integrity."
 BRA_the_48_Hour_Ultimatum: "The 48 Hour Ultimatum"
 BRA_the_48_Hour_Ultimatum_desc: "Let us issue a 48-hour ultimatum giving these vultures a choice: either they leave Brazilian waters or have their ships seized and their workers imprisoned. But we should be vigilant; if one of these people decides it'd be a good idea to test the ultimatum and enter our waters another time, we should be ready to back our words up with force."
 BRA_Seize_Their_Ships: "Seize Their Ships"
 BRA_Seize_Their_Ships_desc: "Following the advice given by our army and navy, we will seize those ships that are in our waters. Let us send out ships and planes to locate the boats, frighten the bigger ones, and seize the smaller ones. These rabid corporations will see reason if we attack the only thing that matters to them: the bottom line of their profits. The more boats they lose the more unprofitable it becomes, and the less they will fish in our waters."
 BRA_Meet_With_Muller: "Meet With Müller"
 BRA_Meet_With_Muller_desc: "Quadros now suggests sending Reichskommissar Müller a letter in service of Quadros' goal of securing a more independent Brazilian foreign policy. If we can get hold of him personally we can try to get him to restrain the companies in his territory; but if it fails and the matter gets leaked we will damage our credibility and anger the Americans for trying to work with Nazis. Let's hope he accepts, and, just as importantly, that everyone who knows about this plan keeps their damned mouths shut."
 BRA_A_Trip_to_the_Congo: "A Trip to the Congo"
 BRA_A_Trip_to_the_Congo_desc: "Now that Müller has accepted our request, let's send Walter Salles to the Kongo and Zentralafrika to meet with him (and his hypercompetent sidekick Rolf Steiner) and spend a week there discussing plans about what to do. We might want to dangle a lifetime supply of Brazilian lobster for the Zentralafrikan upper echelon or a few hundred all-expenses-paid hunting trips in the Brazilian rainforest in front of Müller to sweeten the deal, because these negotiations will be tough. To make matters easier in that, we will send Walter Salles, our best diplomat, to deal with these negotiations. Let us hope and pray that he is successful."
 BRA_The_Bountiful_Harvest: "The Bountiful Harvest"
 BRA_The_Bountiful_Harvest_desc: "The Lobster War has ended in a Brazilian victory. With competition now gone, large amounts of fish and lobsters can arrive on our shores once again as Brazilian fishermen are freed to fish their rightful waters unchallenged. A bountiful harvest - and greater economic prosperity - is on the way. With this victory, our Republic of Brazil is one step closer to bringing about Ordem e Progresso in its own lands."
 BRA_The_Germans_Pacified: "The Germans Pacified"
 BRA_The_Germans_Pacified_desc: "German ships have stopped coming into our waters in such large numbers; we have succeeded in our objective of dramatically reducing the number of lobsters being illegally fished in our waters.

 ## Economics
 BRA_Coffee_With_Neves: "Coffee With Neves"
 BRA_Coffee_With_Neves_desc: "Henrique Teixeira Lott will now meet with Tancredo Neves in order to discuss the economic situation that our Republic now finds itself in. Senhor Lott believes that Neves' help will be the weapon he needs in order to put Brazil's economic chaos to an end. As for Senhor Neves, he wishes to discuss managing the economy and development of Brazil, and believes that this President is best-placed to see Brazil's economic revival through.\n\nNeedless to say, the cups of fine Brazilian coffee that Lott and Neves gulp down during this meeting may well turn out to be the most important drinks in modern Brazilian history."
 BRA_Neves_Plan: "The Neves Plan"
 BRA_Neves_Plan_desc: "The plan suggested by our esteemed finance minister, the prudent Tancredo Neves, is as follows.\nRaise taxes, fees, and otherwise get hold of money in order to service our debt which, thanks to the ambitious spending programs of President Lott's predecessor among other things, is at a crisis level, before we give any thought to promoting economic growth. Only when this debt has less of a stranglehold on us can we get to work on various investment and economic stimulus schemes, which will grow the economy. This will in turn further reduce our debt and free us to do what we want with our finances."
 BRA_Lets_Raise_Some_Taxes: "Raise Some Taxes"
 BRA_Lets_Raise_Some_Taxes_desc: "One of the major planks of Neves' economic renewal plan is the raising of taxes. We need these taxes in order to deal with the debt crisis and deficit, and taxes are the first and simplest path of many paths we will have to take.\nAccordingly, we will raise taxes on the middle and upper classes - but NOT on the poor.\nNever mind the fact that raising taxes on poor people is immoral or a first-class vote-loser, Vargas' angry criticisms for stabbing his "children" in the back like that would create enough political chaos to make even a Quadros rampage seem calm and peaceful by comparison."
 BRA_Lower_Interest_Rates: "Raise Interest Rates"
 BRA_Lower_Interest_Rates_desc: "Raising interest rates is also a good idea during times of economic malaise. It is a measure that has been taken by countless national banks throughout the world since the idea of a state-controlled bank became commonplace. Doing this will put more money in the Brazillian workers pocket in hte long run, by directly tackling inflation and lowering it. While this may have a short term effect on our economic growth, further investment in Industrialisation and Mechanization under the advice of Neves, will ensure that in the long run economic growth is not hampered. Thus with both inflation being lowered and long run economic growth continued, this will in turn benefit the Brazilian economy in the long run."
 BRA_Control_Transfer_Profits: "Control Profit Transfer"
 BRA_Control_Transfer_Profits_desc: "Companies, wealthy people, and other assorted types that form part of the One Percent tend to transfer money all over the place like balls in a tilted pinball machine. At the moment, our government does not gain anything from this; if we impose regulations and taxes, we will secure a lucrative new source of taxable wealth for the Brazilian bottom line. Sure, it will anger these groups, but that is a price worth paying for the welfare of the Republic and its people. They will realize the rightness of this policy in due time."
 BRA_Enact_Deflationary_Policies: "Enact Deflationary Policies"
 BRA_Enact_Deflationary_Policies_desc: "Inflation is something that has bedeviled our nation for the longest time, and it has tortured Brazilian pocketbooks at all levels of society. From the poorest favela resident to the wealthiest denizen of Jardins in São Paulo, there is no taxpayer in this country that has not been at least somewhat inconvenienced (if not outright ruined) by the vicissitudes of inflation. Decisive action must be taken in order to reduce its further effects on our people. Though Neves is not too focused on this - the people have coped and will cope, and other things also need to be handled - he will still make sure decisive action is taken to reduce the problem."
 BRA_Continue_Industralization: "Continue Industralization"
 BRA_Continue_Industralization_desc: "Industrialization is the future of our Brazilian economy. Accordingly, if we want the economy to grow, our nation to modernize, and its people's welfare to improve, we must keep the process of industrializing the country continuing at full speed. As such, factories, refineries, and other assorted modern industrial facilities will be built under the Government's aegis.\nTrue, this will impede our progress on the reduction of inflation. But if we manage to keep everything under rational management, we should at least be able to prevent inflation from increasing any further. And a population that benefits from improved industry will be more resilient against the problems caused by inflation, so it is all worth it."
 BRA_Industralize_The_Interior: "Industrialize the Interior"
 BRA_Industralize_The_Interior_desc: "The interior regions of the Republic of Brazil, far away from the initial areas of settlement, are not nearly as developed as the heartlands around Guanabara and São Paulo. In light of the great potential that these regions have, to say nothing of the sheer wealth of resources they possess, this is frankly a travesty; it cannot be allowed to continue. In accordance with Senhor Neves' directives, the interior will be industrialized so that its resources and human capital can be leveraged both for its own good and for that of the Brazilian state more generally."
 BRA_Industralize_The_South: "Industrialize the South"
 BRA_Industralize_The_South_desc: "The southern regions of our country, close to the Argentine and Oriental borders, have a significant infrastructure network that is not currently sufficiently leveraged. Accordingly Senhor Neves has directed us to take action to improve the industry in these areas as well as in the Interior.\nThis directive is a no-brainer for us. If we industrialize in the south, it is far easier to put it to use quickly. This is because the factories and what-have-you will start off connected to decent roads and will therefore be able to send and receive goods almost immediately."
 BRA_Repairing_Kubitscheks_Road_System: "Repairing Kubitschek's Road System"
 BRA_Repairing_Kubitscheks_Road_System_desc: "In the years since the presidency of our esteemed predecessor, Juscelino Kubitschek, the great road system he established while in power has fallen out of repair. Day after day reports of cars crashing, falling into potholes, and losing tires to ruts in roads are made to the transport administration. This is damaging to the economy, public welfare, and international image of our country; it cannot and will not be tolerated. Accordingly, we will make a significant investment to repair the damage to the new Brazilian road system and, while we are at it, further improve our nation's infrastructure so as to strengthen the economy."
 BRA_Mechanization_Programs: "Mechanization Programs"
 BRA_Mechanization_Programs_desc: "The South has massive farms and plantations scattered all over it; these grow large amounts of cash crops and assorted fruits. However, due to a lack of mechanization, they have yet to reach their full potential. Investing in agricultural mechanization in this region will allow us to drastically increase the output from these properties. This will ameliorate local economic productivity, improve the quality of life for people in that region, and put us one step closer to achieving the President's goal of putting an end to the economic instability that has plagued Brazil for the longest time."
 BRA_Neves_Plan_Finish: "Neves' Plan complete!"
 BRA_Neves_Plan_Finish_desc: "With the completion of the plan of Tancredo Neves for resolving our economic malaise, economic growth has been achieved and the debt crisis has been resolved for the time being. We have successfully industrialized formerly underdeveloped regions of Brazil, mechanized farms, modernized and renewed infrastructure, secured new sources of income for the Government, and put more money into the pockets of ordinary Brazilians. Truly the President was wise to put our trust in Senhor Neves. ...Granted, the inflation has not gone down by much, but it will decrease over time thanks to our wise economic policies. Surely it won't increase … right?"
 BRA_Form_Agriculture_Comission: "Form an Agricultural Comission"
 BRA_Form_Agriculture_Comission_desc: "The Peasant's League has lost its leader and now the rural regions of Brazil are once more in chaos. Peasant leagues and unions, no longer restrained, are making unrestrained demands and striking en masse. Even when strikes are not taking place, employee-employer tensions are rising to an unsustainable level, and it is beginning to negatively affect our politics and economy. This cannot be borne; accordingly, President Lott will convene an agricultural commission in order to devise a plan of action for agrarian reform and devise a bill that will put this issue to rest once and for all."
 BRA_Deploy_Goulart: "Deploy Goulart"
 BRA_Deploy_Goulart_desc: "João Goulart is well-respected among the rural and labor movements. The de-facto leader of the PTB is known for his ability to effectively empathize with the people. People are willing to tell him what they want and listen to his suggestions in a way that Lott or any other prominent member of the PSD or even the PTB cannot hope to equal. That is just what we need if we want to bring about a positive end to this challenging situation. President Lott recognizes this; accordingly, he will send Goulart to talk with these people and calm them down."
 BRA_Investigate_Peasent_Leaders: "Investigate the Peasant Leagues"
 BRA_Investigate_Peasent_Leaders_desc: "The leadership of the peasant leagues as it currently stands is a clear and present danger to the Republic of Brazil, and the military has no illusions about this. Accordingly, they have been talking to Henrique Lott, their former colleague, and have convinced him that decisive action must be taken to prevent these nuisances from turning into something more than that.\nJânio Quadros, backed by some members of the PTB, is complaining quite loudly (as is his wont) about this proposed method; he thinks it could backfire on us. But Lott and the military believe that the benefits of putting these seditionists down far outweigh the risks, and so they will push through with this course of action."
 BRA_Stop_League_Crackdowns: "Stop League Crackdowns"
 BRA_Stop_League_Crackdowns_desc: "Now it is true that these Peasant Leagues and their leaders are not the most reasonable or effective in the pursuit of their goals - this is to be expected. What is clear to President Lott is that their cause is just; they only want to create a better, more equitable and just Brazil for themselves and their children. This is why he allowed himself to be convinced by a faction composed of the PTB, Tancredo Neves, and - surprisingly enough - Jânio Quadros to cut down on the current crackdown against the Peasant Leagues.\nSome members of the military are grumbling; they accuse the President of treating "Amazonianist subversives'' and "commies" with kid-gloves. But Lott, Neves, the PTB, and Quadros believe that the benefits of showing the peasants kindness far outweigh the risks, and so they will push through with this course of action."
 BRA_The_Agrarian_Bill: "Pen an Agrarian Bill"
 BRA_The_Agrarian_Bill_desc: "Having taken initial action regarding the problem of the Peasant Leagues, it is time for the Lott Government to take the final decision that will put an end to the protests paralyzing the Republic. President Lott and his government are proposing a comprehensive land-reform bill that, if passed, will cause the largest land redistribution in Brazilian history.\nThe proposed program will transfer land from large rural landowners to the poorest rural citizens that are best-placed to put it to use for their families and the Nation. (Mind you, we will of course give the affected landowners compensation and allow them enough loopholes where they will not flee the country with their money.)\nIt will be difficult to pass, but if we manage to pull it off it will be worth it."
 BRA_Union_Negotations: "Union Negotiations"
 BRA_Union_Negotations_desc: "The labor unions are one of the major factors of the current crisis; they are the organizing force behind some of the larger strikes currently ongoing. It is imperative for us to get them on board with this bill if we wish to use it as a means to bring back industrial harmony. However, if our bill is too weak, our overtures may backfire and cause them to keep on protesting.\nAccordingly, we will meet with the union leaders, determine what issues if any they have with the current bill, and see if we can reach a permanent modus vivendi with them."
 BRA_Smooth_Talk_Ranchers: "Wrangle the Ranchers"
 BRA_Smooth_Talk_Ranchers_desc: "Ranchers and other assorted landholders will also be affected by this bill; they know it, and they are shouting about this plan at the top of their lungs. But it so happens that they are also a major source of finance for the PSD, UDN, PSP, and even some PTB politicians' political campaigns. We can and must leverage this fact.\nAccordingly, we will get hold of them and see what they want from us. True, we may have to compromise and go a few steps down from the land reform we wanted. But in exchange we will possibly be able to get them to compromise with us and maybe shut up a little. The concessions we will have to make will be worth it when we are freed of landowners screaming like so many mynah birds on drugs about how Lott and his officials are tools of Amazonianism every tenth of a second."
 BRA_Hold_The_Vote: "Hold the Vote"
 BRA_Hold_The_Vote_desc: "We have done as much glad-handing, negotiating, politicking, and bargaining as President Lott deems necessary to see this bill of his through. Now all that is left is to put an end to the incessant prevarication that is so common in politics and finally get on with putting the Agrarian Reform to a vote in the Congresso Nacional. The pessimist within Lott worries that this bill will not get the votes that are needed for it to pass, but the more hopeful part of him thinks that he has (probably, he hopes, God willing) convinced enough people for this much-needed policy to go through."
 BRA_Agrarian_Bill_Passes: "The Agrarian Bill Passes"
 BRA_Agrarian_Bill_Passes_desc: "We have done it! The bill on agrarian reform has passed with a clear majority mandate from the Congresso Nacional, thus permitting President Lott to go through with the largest land reform program ever embarked on in Brazilian - hell, maybe even South or Latin American - history. Truly this is a major success for the President as he achieves the first step of his dream to bring about comprehensive land reform in the Brazilian Republic. The UDN is screaming, and those landowners we failed to convince are campaigning hard against the bill even though it is a settled matter. But long-overdue justice has been done, and the rural poor and laborers will respect Lott all the more for it. Oba!"

Despite the best efforts of the President and the PTB, the bill on agrarian reform, which had so much potential to build a more just and equitable Brazil, has been shot down in the Congresso Nacional due to the intransigence of the UDN and some rebels within the President's own PSD. Needless to say, the Peasant Leagues and so many others that put their faith in this bill are unhappy. While the countryside descends into chaos once more, President Lott backward casts his eye on these prospects drear. Forward, though he cannot see, he guesses and fears."
 BRA_All_We_Can_Do_Now: "Time for Restraint"
 BRA_All_We_Can_Do_Now_desc: "The bill has passed, and it is time to let the waters settle. An agrarian reform of this kind will have the same effect as throwing a large boulder into a standing pool. The water and other things in the pool will start moving all over the place. Accordingly, while we deal with the consequences of this success of ours, let us avoid the urge to go off on any other policy adventures. We must enforce the bill and bring this recent fight of ours to a successful conclusion rather than setting off a new one and overextending ourselves."
 BRA_Calm_Down_The_Countryside: "Calm Down the Countryside"
 BRA_Calm_Down_The_Countryside_desc: "In the aftermath of our unfortunate failure in the Congresso Nacional, the unions and peasants are in open revolt. In their desperation they are beginning to find the mad ideologies of people like Amazonas and the lunatics around Salvador Allende appealing. They are proposing performing land reform and redistribution by force the way those MIR lunatics over in Chile tried to do in the south of that country. This cannot be borne; though we are to blame for this failure, the people must be prevented from taking their rage out on each other and their nation. We will take decisive action - through words or force, whatever works - to prevent this from spiraling out of control."
 BRA_Quadros_Plan: "The Quadros Plan"
 BRA_Quadros_Plan_desc: "Our maverick vice-president, Jânio Quadros, sees things differently from Neves. He thinks that, rather than taking more money from the average Brazilian, we should instead cut down on our current spending through a thoroughgoing austerity program. Slash unnecessary social and infrastructure programs left and right until our finances are more secure, and then negotiate with one of the great powers for a loan so that Brazil can put an end to its financial woes. Going with this plan will not only help us restabilize our bottom line and please Quadros; it will also help suppress inflation, which is currently a major problem, by reducing the current flood of government money in the economy."
 BRA_Slow_Down_Industralization: "Slow Down Industralization"
 BRA_Slow_Down_Industralization_desc: "The first step in vice-president Quadros' program is perhaps its most controversial, for Quadros and his faction argue that Brazil must slow down its industrialization drive.\n\nMany see this idea as profoundly counter-intuitive, for South America's under-industrialization is a source of recurrent economic problems. Yet Quadros and his allies argue that the current cure is worse than the disease. The flood of government investment into the economy and foreign debt taken on by new businesses has caused inflation to rampage out of control. Meanwhile both government and private debt continue to soar.\n\nTo safeguard our economy, it is time to put brakes on it before it turns into a runaway disaster. As the tide of easy money and speculative investment recedes, inflation will naturally come down and poor Brazilians will no longer be victimized by financial instability."
 BRA_Cut_Public_Spending: "Cut Public Spending"
 BRA_Cut_Public_Spending_desc: "Government spending has risen rapidly over past years, increasing as a percentage of our GDP even as our economy itself has grown. A lot of this spending has been done through borrowed money, fuelling a growing debt even as government deficits continue to increase.\n\nThe rising cost of servicing the debt, as well as the crowding out effect occurring as businessmen cannot afford to outbid the government on foreign financial markets are both becoming drains on the economy. It is time for the republic to end its spendthriftness , and for balanced budgets to become the norm once more.\n\nCutting back on social programs and public spending will be costly politically at first. The continued prosperity of the nation demands it."
 BRA_Slash_Highway_Budget: "Slash the Highway Budget"
 BRA_Slash_Highway_Budget_desc: "As the nation's public finances are bled white, ever greater amounts of money are funnelled into the highway program. This situation has long been decried by vice-president Quadros. Why waste taxpayer money on roads to nowhere?\n\nPresident Lott has long seen infrastructure as one of the most important areas in which to invest, and vehemently disagrees with his vice-president that better roads to connect the nation's cities and villages is anything but a net gain for the country. Nevertheless, the president has agreed to reduce the scope of his highway program as a condition of following Quadros' economic plan. While it pains Lott greatly to see the highway budget slashed, the political gains from appeasing Quadros and his allies will be well worth it. The extra money will be put to good use elsewhere."
 BRA_Begin_Debt_Negotations: "Begin Debt Negotiations"
 BRA_Begin_Debt_Negotations_desc: "The mountain of debt inherited, and added to, by our government, remains a major problem. Not only are the loans draining a ton of resources from our government; they are also a political powderkeg that may see us defeated at the ballot box in the future.\n\nVice-President Quadros' economic plan seeks to undo this Gordian knot. His approach is two-fold. A program of austerity to gain the confidence of financiers, and securing the help of a foreign power to help restructure our debts by borrowing at a much lower cost. Having done the first half of his program, we now approach the other half.\n\nWhile Quadros' idea has generated cautious hope throughout the government, his proposed source of funds has not been unanimously well received. Quadros wishes to request help from Japan to restructure our debts. This goes against our traditional foreign policy, and may irritate the Americans who have always been a reliable trade partner. As such many within the cabinet suggest we approach Washington for the loan program. A decision must be made."
 BRA_Talk_With_Sphere: "Talk with the Sphere"
 BRA_Talk_With_Sphere_desc: "Quadros' arguments have carried the day. Despite the worries of our foreign policy grandees, the vice-president's argument that weakening our reliance on America will strengthen our hand has won more than a few adherents.\n\nThe Japanese government will be approached for help in this debt restructuring. Tokyo has long sought new trade partners beyond eastern Asia, and will no doubt be interested in buying our friendship on the cheap. That said, the Japanese will still need reassurances. Rumblings are reaching us of a slowdown in the imperial economy. The sphere's diplomats will no doubt drive a harder bargain than usual."
 BRA_Talk_With_Americans: "Talk to the Americans"
 BRA_Talk_With_Americans_desc: "Our foreign minister Walter Salles has managed to convince the cabinet that the best source of funds will be the United States of America. Vice-President Quadros will be dismayed to see his drive to wean Brazil off American dominance is to be put on hold for now. However he will hopefully be satisfied to continue helping us put his plan into motion.\n\nUncle Sam always has time for friends. However our contacts in Washington have signalled to us that the department of state worries of the preponderance of the state in our economy. American money is likely to be available to us for debt restructuring... However the northern giant will no doubt attach conditions to it to encourage Brazil to remain a liberal democracy with what are deemed sufficiently 'healthy' markets."
 BRA_Reduce_Tarrifs: "Reduce Japanese Tarrifs"
 BRA_Reduce_Tarrifs_desc: "The Japanese have accepted! From the Sphere flows enough low interest loans to end Brazil's debt crisis forever!\n\nAttached to this bail-out are a few conditions. The biggest of these, and one we should have seen coming, is a severe reduction of tariffs between us and the sphere. The Japanese have long sought new trade partners, shut-off as they are from American and European markets. They now turn to us to buy their knick-knacks.\n\nThis loss of tariff is of course concerning to those who seek to protect domestic industries. However, without an end to the debt crisis Brazilian industries are not likely to weather the storm ahead. We must thus risk this new danger rather than keep the old one."
 BRA_Zaitbasu_Land_Grants: "Zaibatsu Land Grants"
 BRA_Zaitbasu_Land_Grants_desc: "Many of the Japanese ZaIbatsus, or financial cliques, have expressed interest in operating in Brazil. Beyond lowering the traffic partner, our new sponsors in Tokyo expect a degree of reciprocity in our dealing with their national champions. As such, we must help the Zaibatsus plant roots in Latin America.\n\nTo go about this, land will be sold cheaply to our foreign partners. This small loss will serve as a good faith demonstration of our will to strengthen our commercial ties to the far east. If the next century is to be an Asian one, Brazil must get on the ground of this new era."
 BRA_Negotations_Collapse: "The Negotiations Collapsed"
 BRA_Negotations_Collapse_desc: " Talks with a potential foreign source of loans has broken down! With the other great powers unwilling to help us at this time after being spurned by our foreign ministry, it seems that Brazil will have to go at it alone for the time being.\n\nThe debt crisis still looms large over us. While Quadros had some contingency plans for such a disastrous outcome, the solutions remaining for us are not pretty. The cabinet will bring onboard some more economists to help us stitch together a new strategy. One thing is for sure, this failure has generated a great deal of tension between the vice-president and president."
 BRA_Some_More_Cuts: "Some More Spending Cuts"
 BRA_Some_More_Cuts_desc: "Once, the Quadros plan saw us cut with a surgeon's precision. Without the help of a foreign power taking on much of our debt, it is time for Brazil to begin deeper cuts.\n\nThe Kubitschek era programs have to be aggressively trimmed down. Industrialization, healthcare, education, public services; all will see devastating cuts. The people will no doubt howl in frustration, while the opposition will make much of the end of social programs our predecessors have begun. No matter the fallout however, we must walk this cruel path if the country is to reach solvency."
 BRA_Lower_Corporation_Tax: "Lower American Corporation Tax"
 BRA_Lower_Corporation_Tax_desc: "Our successful negotiations with the Americans have seen Brazil's financial situation be entirely salvaged. Now however comes the time to pay for the help the Americans are sending our way.\n\nA particular sticking point in the negotiations was the issue of corporate taxations. The Americans have been much impressed by how quickly the Quadros plan has restored fiscal sanity to the nation. However, the taxation rate on corporations remains extremely high. For the sake of better trade between our nations, as well as mutual investments, the tax rate has to go down.\n\nWhile caving to the American demands will not be too popular, there are few other options. Increased investment from our northern partners as well as the end of the debt crisis will be worth it all in the end."
 BRA_Protect_American_Bussiness: "Protect American Business Interests"
 BRA_Protect_American_Bussiness_desc: "Washington has long been skeptical of our predecessor's policies. The Kubitschek-era saw many talks of nationalizing foreign businesses operating in Brazil. Washington wants guarantees that such talk will never trouble the American business community in Brazil ever again.\n\nSuch guarantees will pass through new laws making it either impossible or very costly to nationalize foreign businesses. This will be unpopular with many within the country, especially within our party's left. However the situation has forced our hands. If Brazil is to escape the debt trap into which it entered, it must accept the American's help. A bankruptcy on our debt would devastate our economic sovereignty."
 BRA_Quadro_Plan_Finish: "The Quadros Plan Complete"
 BRA_Quadro_Plan_Finish_desc: "Vice-President Quadros, an odd presence within the Brazilian political sphere, has long had his doubters. Our decision to begin his program of economic reforms was seen as a dangerous step backward. Our critics on the left accused us of reversing the policies that saw the Kubitschek era bring Brazil into modernity.\n\nNow that the program has been completed, Brazil has come out of a shadowy valley and into a bright new era. Our industrial growth has slowed, and the economy has suffered a few set-backs on the way. However the debt crisis that rocked the nation is a thing of the past. Our deficit is finally narrowing down to zero. Most importantly, inflation, that killer of working class families, is finally a thing of the past.\n\nVice-President Quadros is content that our government has followed his calls for austerity and financial reforms. We now turn to face the future, better equipped to safeguard the nation's prosperity."

 BRA_brazil_to_the_rescue_desc: "Millions of our lusophone brothers are oppressed by the Nazi tyranny in Angola and Mozambique. Worse yet, millions of South Africans are now also in danger of being put under the jackboot. Brazil neither can nor will allow such a terrible state of affairs to continue without intervening. Just as the Prussian cavalry arrived at the last moment and saved the British at Waterloo, the Brazilian Army shall come to Africa and save the Anglos again!\n\nEven better, the collapse of the African Reichskommissariate will make Brazil the main naval power in the Southern Atlantic, thereby decisively ending the naval conflicts that we have had to fight for the past twenty years. The President has ordered it and thus it shall be so, we shall go to war to support South Africa."
 BRA_convince_the_legislature: "Convince the Legislature"
 BRA_convince_the_legislature_desc: "Political articulation is a difficult thing, but thankfully the President has got figures like Tancredo Neves and Edna Lott to engage in the requisite smooth talk with our legislators. The good part of fighting side to side with the Americans is that the UDN will be easier to convince, with Carlos Lacerda also showing strong support for the war. But there are still those strongly isolationist members of the PTB that might need a bit of encouragement. Through reforms, agreements and an occasional bribe, the road to an intervention shall be de-obstructed and the legislators will one by one come around to Brazil intervening on South Africa's behalf."
 BRA_cia_contacts: "CIA Contacts"
 BRA_cia_contacts_desc: "The CIA is everywhere and there is little we can do to completely root it out of our country at the moment. However President Lott still can talk with his American friends about using it to influence public perception to favor the war through the creative methods that American intelligence services know best. The CIA and other American factors can take care of the tasks that Lott does not want the Brazilian government to get involved in. Letting them take care of the bribes, intimidation and so on will aid Brazil's efforts to join the war and will be a victory for the free world."
 BRA_convince_the_people: "Convince the People"
 BRA_convince_the_people_desc: "One of the most important things we inherited from the Estado Novo dictatorship was the Agência Nacional, or National Agency, which was responsible for producing and disseminating government newsreels and media. By cooperating with American newspapers to disseminate news of the Nazi atrocities in Africa and utilizing the nationalistic propaganda created by our army we can cause a patriotic surge similar to the one we had during the second great war. We just need to hope that this war doesn't end like the last one."
 BRA_send_our_guns: "Send our Guns"
 BRA_send_our_guns_desc: "Brazil has its own military-industrial complex, inherited from the New State and the Gomes government that followed it. In defense of democracy, we shall flood South Africa with as many guns as we can. These guns will supply the poorly-equipped South African troops, allowing them to hold the line against the flood of Boers and Germans. These guns will include state of the art Brazilian equipment, but also large quantities of older models that are being replaced. After all, an outdated gun is better than nothing, and it's not as if we're sending them blunderbusses."
 BRA_air_support: "Air Support"
 BRA_air_support_desc: "As our intervention grows in size and more after-action reports return from the front, it has become clear that one of the major advantages that the Reichskommissariate enjoy is their efficient use of airpower. As such we must reduce their advantage by sending more helicopters to better supply our troops and bring the battle to the enemy. Good, reliable Brazilian bombers and helicopters will defeat Südwestafrika's fighters, thus allowing us to drive the Germans out of the air, before crushing them on the ground and proving once and for all that they are not the 'master race'."
 BRA_operation_deadoro: "Operation Deodoro"
 BRA_operation_deadoro_desc: "The time has come! The people have been inflamed by our campaigns, the politicians are following our policies and voices of the non-interventionists such as Quadros have been overshadowed by the louder cries of our people. Brazil will begin to send volunteers and soldiers across the Atlantic, to fight and die for democracy and freedom. Some talk of increasing violence by locals against people of German ancestry, but surely this is merely propaganda uttered by Hitlerite sycophants implanted in Brazilian society.\n\nNever mind the discriminatory policies enacted in South Africa, life is always better under the Anglos than the German-backed Boers. Even if we did decide to change our minds it is too late; the propaganda we gave to the people has been too effective. They demand war and victory. Brazil is coming to Africa, for the defense of Democracy and for the rescue of our brothers. Senta a pua!"

Lott has gathered his cabinet: for the true task, he says, the task that will preserve Brazilian democracy, and ensure another 55 can never occur again, will begin now."
 BRA_operation_toucan: "Operation Toucan"
 BRA_operation_toucan_desc: "Operation Toucan is President Lott's plan to depoliticize the armed forces of Brazil. Lott wants to remove self-centered hardliners and replace them with constitutionalist officers and generals who will respect and protect democracy. Lott enters into this endeavor knowing that pacifying the stormy ocean that is the armed forces will be so difficult as to make the Lobster War seem like a brief dip in a child's pool by comparison. "
 BRA_contact_gomes: "Contact Gomes"
 BRA_contact_gomes_desc: "In reorganizing the Brazilian Air Force, we can attempt to enlist the help of Senhor Eduardo Gomes, who served as President of Brazil from 1950 to 1955, in cleansing the armed forces. It will be difficult to convince him, but the reward will be great: our reforms will be stronger and more robust, and the backlash from the Air Force will be lessened."
 BRA_destroy_the_delusions: "Destroy the Delusions"
 BRA_destroy_the_delusions_desc: "Our air force is filled with delusional imbeciles that think of themselves as untouchable knights of the air, unaccountable to no-one. Lott wants them to understand that, just like everyone else. they are in fact neither untouchable nor unaccountable. Hopefully, as Lott moves to remove these people of these ideals, at least some of them will devote themselves to the Republic and its Constitution instead."
 BRA_oaths_to_the_republic: "Oaths to the Republic"
 BRA_oaths_to_the_republic_desc: "We shall pass a law making all military officers swear on the Bible with the Lord Himself as their witness that they will respect the Republic of Brazil and be loyal to the Constitution above all else. (The President insists on this because he knows that bringing God into it will make the officers take it seriously, or at least more seriously than any number of appeals to reason.) This will start only in the air force, but Lott will spread this practice throughout the armed forces, using the air force as a test to see how people respond."
 BRA_send_sarmento: "Sarmento in Manaus"
 BRA_send_sarmento_desc: "Sarmento, a hardliner rival of President Lott, was involved in the putsch of 1955. Since then, he has continued to be a thorn in Lott's side and poses a severe challenge to any future attempts to depoliticize the armed forces. Reassigning this nuisance to Manaus - a textbook "reassignment to Antarctica" as they call it - will remove him from the military halls of power and make him a nonentity, thus clearing an obstacle to the depoliticization of the Brazilian military. Have a pleasant time in the Amazon, Sarmento; you'll be 'on vacation' there for a long time."
 BRA_expose_kruel: "Expose Kruel"
 BRA_expose_kruel_desc: "Field Marshal Kruel was caught in the act of accepting bribes from Japanese and American corporations. A venal individual such as this should not be entrusted with anything, let alone command of troops. Exposing Kruel will force him to resign in disgrace, thus removing another obstacle to the President's plans. It galls Lott beyond belief to do this; Kruel is a long serving general and a man with whom Lott worked with in the past. But it must go through. It is for the greater good of Brazil."
 BRA_police_the_officers: "Police the Officers"
 BRA_police_the_officers_desc: "Let us integrate civilian police and observers in the armed forces to police the officers. This will further Lott's two goals of fully subordinating the armed forces to civilian authority and making officers (and the armed forces more generally) accountable to the Brazilian state."
 BRA_promote_constitutionalists: "Promote Constitutionalists"
 BRA_promote_constitutionalists_desc: "Constitutionalists are the faction of the Army that is loyal to President Lott and his ideals of constitutionalism and democracy. Promoting them will increase their influence at the expense of the Hardliners and Sobronne, thereby increasing the prevalence of constitutionalist thought and ideals in the Army."
 BRA_investigate_the_marines: "Investigate the Marines"
 BRA_investigate_the_marines_desc: "The Marines must be invested in order to understand the extent to which antidemocratic thought has spread among them. It isn't likely to be all that significant a problem due to their size compared to the rest of the armed forces. But one can never be too cautious, a single rebellious group in the armed forces could lead to disaster. The marines are no exception and must full under the same scruitny as the rest of the armed forces."
 BRA_fire_potential_troublemakers: "Fire Potential Troublemakers"
 BRA_fire_potential_troublemakers_desc: "Now we will turn to the Navy and cut down hardliner influence by getting rid of any troublemakers present in it. Sailors that discuss antidemocratic thought will be told to pack their bags and new ones will arrive to take their place. These new sailors will be sound people with mindsets that favor the Republic and democracy. While some say this is an overreach of Lott's powers, he blows them off, insisting it must be done."
 BRA_sweep_the_navy_clean: "Sweep the Navy Clean"
 BRA_sweep_the_navy_clean_desc: "There are only a few more troublemakers left in the Navy, mainly the hardliner or other troublesome admirals. Getting rid of Cândido da Costa Aragão, the self-proclaimed "People's Admiral", will be a good place to start. Then we can move on to getting rid of other such hardliner Admirals. The navy, like the army and air force, will be cleansed utterly of corruption."
 BRA_the_lott_act: "The Lott Act"
 BRA_the_lott_act_desc: "The Lott Act is the last stage of President Lott's Operation Toucan. Like the Hatch Act passed by the U.S. Congress, it forces political neutrality in the armed forces by, among other things, outlawing any military interference in governance. After this goes through, Lott will finally be able to see the completion of his dream of kicking politics out of the armed forces and protecting democracy in the Republic of Brazil... unless some damn fool manages to destroy his hard work later on."

 BRA_celebrating_its_passing_desc: "President Lott and Brazil can rest easy now, for the Lott Act has passed through the Senado. Despite the military's feeble attempts to kill the act, their meddling was not enough to stop the passage of a landmark piece of legislation. While the act does plenty to curtail the military's influence in our democratic system, there are still finishing touches that must be put in place to ensure that Brazil's democracy will never be threatened again. Namely, we must address the increasing anger from the military itself and offer our assurances that we will not take additional direct action against them. Furthermore, we must also close any loopholes that are present within the Lott Act to ensure Brazil will remain a free republic forever. For now, though, we must celebrate the passage of the act and the successful defense of our democracy."
 BRA_mourn_its_failure_desc: "Despite our efforts, the Lott Act has failed in the Senate at the hands of shortsighted senators and the military. Our relationship with the Hardliner faction is now irreparable, and it remains to be seen whether or not the military will take increased action in the following election, but it unfortunately remains within their power to do so. While Marshal Lott remains in the presidential office, we must focus on what we can still do to try and curtail the power of the military. The Sorbonne faction is key to us, as we can not afford to anger another faction of the military, and it would be best if we gathered all 3 branches of the armed forces to discuss potential next steps regarding the future."
 BRA_cement_legalism_desc: "The military is not some special entity that can pick and choose which laws it wants to obey or disobey, especially regarding our democracy. While the Lott Act removes any legal avenues for the military to skirt around our constitution, the attitude of subverting our democracy runs deep through our military. We must educate the armed forces and instill a strong emphasis on legalism in the ranks, in order to ensure that the Republic never falls under threat from within itself. Our Constitutionalist allies already believe in the importance of legalism, and they will serve as important educators and allies for us to replace this negative attitude that the military has toward Brazil's politics. To ensure that this sentiment will never reappear, we will continue to promote deserving Constitutionalist officers to senior positions to strengthen our support in the military."
 BRA_cool_the_tensions_desc: "To the surprise of no one, the military has been in vocal opposition to the Lott Act since the day it was announced. However, we cannot afford to have our armed forces continuously feel as if they are antagonized by the government, and we should work to re-establish trust and goodwill with them. It may be a tough sell to convince the military, but it is better that we try and convince a few folks. Talks will be set up with senior officers across the branches of the military, and a few token promises will be handed out to ensure that the military does not continue to feel as if we are targeting them. Even if we are, we cannot anger the military so soon, and it is necessary for us to de-escalate the situation, lest they feel compelled to attempt a coup of our government. "
 BRA_compromise_with_moderates_desc: "Just like us, the Sorbonne wish to see a stable and safe Brazil. A hostile military that is continuously eyeing the government with suspicion is one that is not protecting the Brazilian people against the perfidious fascists. Marshall Lott believes that there is room to compromise and work with the Sorbonne faction in order to implement some limitations on the military's influence. Although these compromises will not amount to anything close to what was in the Lott Act, something is better than nothing when it comes to safeguarding our democracy. Lott and several cabinet members will meet with General Geisel and see what can be done to convince the Sorbonne and ensure that the Hardliners will never be able to see their agenda come to life. "
 BRA_impement_failsafes_desc: "It is always prudent to prepare for the worst case scenario; Lott is still worried about a potential coup from the Hardliners with covert support from the UDN and PSP in the future. In order to counter this, plans will need to be drawn up to detail preparations and procedures should the government or our allies in the military ever suspect a potential coup. These plans will be reviewed by Constitutionalist generals to ensure that at least parts of the military will continue to stay loyal, and governors of key provinces will be briefed to ensure that the continuation of Brazil's democracy is set in stone. While some believe this action to be overly cautious, Lott believes that there is no price too high to pay for democracy to survive."
 BRA_reform_the_11th_of_november_movement_desc: "If the Hardliners want to play outside the law, then Lott must also resort to such underhanded tactics in order to ensure the survival of Brazil's democratic republic. Disbanded after several peaceful transitions of power after 1955, the 11th of November Movement was founded by Lott to serve as a clandestine group that would continuously promote democracy and do anything within their means to see the republic stand. However, Lott believes that it is necessary to resurrect this group to ensure that democracy will always live on in Brazil. With government resources, Lott can afford to give additional resources and intelligence to members of this movement, but the stakes are much, much higher. It is paramount that this movement lurks in the shadows, quietly promoting democracy; the discovery of this group could start a coup itself, if Lott is not careful."
 




######## Hundred Days Crisis
 BRA_brasilia_paralyzed: "Brasília Paralyzed"
 BRA_brasilia_paralyzed_desc: "The Hundred Days' Crisis has begun. President Lott resigned, Vice-President Quadros failed to seize control in the resulting vacuum, and the only remaining alternative, President of the Chamber of Deputies Goulart, who was the legal successor, was refused appointment to the Presidency by the machinations of Auro de Moura Andrade. The military, using the officer Sílvio Frota as a mouthpiece, has given the Senate exactly one-hundred days to choose a new President before it "does what it has to do". Disorder takes hold in the Parliament and the Republic more generally as four candidates - the PSD's Kubitschek, the PTB's Goulart, the PSP's Adhemar, and the UDN's Lacerda plan out their route to the Palácio do Planalto."
 BRA_now_or_never: "Now or Never"
 BRA_now_or_never_desc: "Time is running out! There are only a few days left before the Hundred Days come to an end and Sílvio Frota and his military goons go through with their threat. At this point, ideology is thrown out the window in favor of a pragmatic decision, and avoiding the disaster that would be a military intervention is of the highest priority. To that end, previously-undecided senators are beginning to coalesce behind the leading candidate despite whatever disagreements they might have with that individual. One can only hope that this show of democratic unity and prudence will be able to produce a definitive result before the nearly-empty hourglass runs dry."

 BRA_the_crow_and_the_bull_desc: "Lacerda and Adhemar are not friends by any definition of the term. Even if one catches them agreeing on something, they will react with denial if they hear claims that they are in fact in agreement on that topic. Despite this, the two men understand that they are better off fighting together instead of apart or worse yet against each other - only united do they have any hope of defeating the PSD-PTB coalition. This doesn't mean that they like each other any more than before all this started, however. As the Crisis rages and the deliberations begin, the tension between the Crow and the Bull can be felt from easily half a kilometre away."
 BRA_adhemars_strategy: "Adhemar's Strategy"
 BRA_adhemars_strategy_desc: "Adhemar de Barros is of the view that bribes and corruption will be more than sufficient to allow him to gain power. To that end, he will bribe and blackmail as many senators, congresspeople, and other such political riff-raff as humanly possible, digging up skeletons from closets faster than a land developer desecrating a cemetery, in order to obtain their (willing or unwilling) support for his candidacy. At the same time, he will go out and harangue the public all over Brazil in order to obtain their support for his presidency. The combination of corrupted politicians and adoring civilians will be more than enough, Adhemar thinks, to get him into the Palácio do Planalto."

Their connections and local strength in critical states such as São Paulo, will make them a useful asset in securing Adhemar's victory in the Hundred Days' Crisis. It's time for Adhemar to call his PSP brethren to arms and kick their sleeping apparatus back into motion. From there, all he hopefully has to do is hold on to the guardrails and cruise down the easy road to power on the backs of his loyalists. "
 BRA_lacerdas_gambit: "Lacerda's Gambit"
 BRA_lacerdas_gambit_desc: "Lacerda is risking a lot to become the President. That's why he's called this little enterprise of his a "gambit," though maybe "desperado" would be a more appropriate term given his attitude. Why can we say this? This is because he believes that he simply cannot afford to lose; he has convinced himself that if he is defeated, the victor will try to do away with him. Accordingly, while relying on his own UDN as a solid block of support, he will apply media pressure on those senators he is able to target in order to obtain their backing."
 BRA_rally_the_udn: "Rally the UDN"
 BRA_rally_the_udn_desc: "The UDN were never ardent supporters of Vice-President Quadros. Not only is the man prone to making an absolute fool of himself if he so much as makes a single step or utters a single word, during his governance he had significant disagreements with UDN policy and made those known at every turn. After years of PSD "governance", it is high time that a UDN member rose to the Presidential dignity. The party members see this opportunity as clearly as Lacerda sees it himself and are eager to take it with both hands; to that end, they have offered him their full support. With the full force of the UDN behind him, Lacerda will be a formidable opponent in the race to control the presidential complex."
 BRA_bribes_for_some: "Bribes for Some"
 BRA_bribes_for_some_desc: "Adhemar knows more than many the effectiveness of bribery in convincing people in general, let alone against members of the political class. People can be turned from vehement opponents to fanatical supporters when exposed to a sufficiently large pile of cruzeiros; the fresher they look the better. With the sword of Sílvio Frota hanging over the Senate, less than a hundred days from falling on the collective head of all Brazil, time is of the essence; traditional negotiations are too slow and inefficient. Greasing palms is the quickest and most effective path to the Presidency. Promises of "budgetary allocation" and "special financial arrangements" should be sufficient to win over some of the more hesitant senators…"
 BRA_blackmail_for_others: "Blackmail for Others"
 BRA_blackmail_for_others_desc: "As one might expect from a man like Adhemar, he is no stranger to dirty tactics. Bribes offer a win-win situation for everyone involved. However some bright-eyed Senators, blind to how beneficial bribery is for them and fancying themselves followers of "justice", "righteousness", and "good governance", loudly consider themselves above such "immoral dealings".\n\nWhile Adhemar laughs at their manic-delusive sanctimony, he prepares an alternate method of persuasion - digging up the closeted skeletons of these so-called "paragons of virtue" and threatening them with a first-rate public airing of dirty laundry. That threat will probably shut up at least ninety percent of them long enough for Adhemar to seat himself behind the presidential desk. After that's done they are free, even welcome, to whine and yell as much as they damn well please; but all the response they will ever get at that point is "Frankly, Senator, I don't give a damn"."
 BRA_lacerdas_speeches: "Lacerda's Speeches"
 BRA_lacerdas_speeches_desc: "Lacerda is a gifted writer and skilled orator. He has a mastery of words on par with the great speakers of the olden days - Pericles, Demosthenes, Abraham Lincoln, and so on. Lacerda knows that he will have to put every talent he has to use if he is to win the Presidency. Accordingly, he plans to embark on a tour of the country, making speeches anywhere and everywhere. That will doubtless be more than sufficient to convince both the Brazilian public and the Senate in Brasília that he is the right man for the job and knows what's best for the State and its people."
 BRA_press_offensive: "Press Offensive"
 BRA_press_offensive_desc: "Brazil's senators are ultimately slaves to the will of the public; as a vampire falls down flat when attacked with garlic, so a senator breaks into a cold sweat when confronted with a hostile ballot. As such, the most effective means of persuading them is to make clear to the public that there's only one clear choice for the next President of Brazil (unless, of course, they want the Republic to fall to ruin). To ensure that the people are convinced of the necessity of choosing the correct President, Lacerda will reach out to his various press contacts throughout the country and have them engage in a bit of, shall we say, public enlightenment."
 BRA_approach_the_prp: "Approach the PRP"
 BRA_approach_the_prp_desc: "The integralists of the PRP are rightly considered too risky and/or radioactive to approach even at a ten-metre distance under most circumstances. (Mind you, they don't help themselves at all.) At this unique time, however, when the very foundations of the Brazilian State are threatened, they are instead an untapped potential source of support. They are currently weak enough where with a sufficiently advantageous deal we will be able to convince them to support us and lend their apparatus to back our candidacy, thus allowing us to push our candidate over the finish line first."

## Coalition Must Hold
 BRA_the_coalition_must_hold: "The Coalition Must Hold"
 BRA_the_coalition_must_hold_desc: "The alliance of the PSD and PTB must hold a conference in order to decide their candidate. João Goulart and the former President, Juscelino Kubitschek, are the two front-runners; they are both planning to make their cases before the party and people even at this very moment. But no matter who wins out, and no matter what platform is decided, two things are agreed upon by all factions of the PSD-PTB pact. The coalition must hold, and a PSD-PTB President must be elected, for the good of the Senate and people of the Republic of Brazil."
 BRA_regroup_the_psd: "Regroup the PSD"
 BRA_regroup_the_psd_desc: "The Partido Social Democrático is a successor to the regime of Getúlio Vargas; God knows we need to fall back on the wise policies of the Father of the Poor once more in these times of crisis. As one might expect, the PSD wields significant influence in both houses of the legislature, and frequently commands large portions of the vote every election. As such, winning their support is essential for the success of either Kubitschek or Goulart's campaign."
 BRA_gather_the_ptb: "Gather the PTB"
 BRA_gather_the_ptb_desc: "The Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro - the Labor Party of Brazil - also wields significant influence, and has done so ever since the demise of Vargas' government. In fact, when Kubitschek was first president about a half-decade ago now, Goulart, a PTB member, was his running-mate and eventually his Vice-President. His support and that of his party proved indispensable in all of Kubitschek's endeavors, especially the founding of Brasília. If Goulart or Kubitschek want to have the kind of success they had last time around, the support of the PTB will be just as indispensable as that of the PSD."
 BRA_the_conference: "The Conference"
 BRA_the_conference_desc: "The PSD-PTB intra-coalition conference is about to begin. The coalition will pass a final decision on which one between Kubitschek and Goulart is the better choice for the Presidency. We can only hope that a candidate will be chosen quickly so that the coalition can mobilize quickly behind him and thus ensure his election as President. But some worry that the convention, far from unifying the coalition and yielding a definitive choice, might instead further inflame already-brewing internal tensions. Needless to say, the eyes of all of the Republic as well as various interested parties in many regions of the world are on us today. "
 BRA_kubitscheks_stand: "Kubitscheck's Stand"
 BRA_kubitscheks_stand_desc: "Kubitschek will not give up, even after the PSD-PTB conference was thrown into deadlock. He deems it critical to take a stand against Lacerda and Adhemar. Accordingly, he will gather his own PSD and convince PTB and UDN members to support him for the Presidency. Despite the recent setback, Kubitschek still refuses to give in or fold over after a single defeat; such luxuries are only available for a weak-minded individual. He believes, not without reason, that he can still win. As such, he will keep fighting hard right to the end of the Hundred Days until and unless he wins or has no choice but to throw in the towel."
 BRA_the_bully_pulpit: "The Bully Pulpit"
 BRA_the_bully_pulpit_desc: ""Bully pulpit, noun - a conspicuous public office or position of authority that provides its occupant with an outstanding opportunity to speak out on any issue. Apparently originally used by President Theodore Roosevelt, explaining his personal view of the presidency."\n\nKubitschek is no slouch when it comes to oratory, nor is he little-known among the people of Brazil. He has a bully pulpit like no-one else in Brazil, and he will put it to good use, campaigning through the Congress and the country at large to make the case for returning him to power as President. After all, unlike all the other candidates, he has a shiny new city and beautiful buildings to point at and claim he made all by himself.\n\n"Niemeyer? Who's that? Never heard of him. It was all me. I did it all.""
 BRA_compromise_with_the_udn: "Compromise With the UDN"
 BRA_compromise_with_the_udn_desc: "The loss of Vice-President Quadros has set the UDN reeling; Kubitschek sees an opportunity in this. Kubitschek, being a former president (and a damn good one if he says so himself), is a known variable for the UDN. It is a well-known fact that negotiations are far easier when you know who you're dealing with. As such, it will be far easier to reach a compromise with at least some of the UDN senators and thereby bring them to our side. After all, a man you've spoken to before is a far better choice for your president than a corrupt good-for-nothing, an idiot who lusts after a golden past that never existed, or worse yet, some violent imbecile who dreams of a time when he can play "dissident-and-reformer hunting" every day and get away with it."
 BRA_plead_with_the_ptb: "Plead With the PTB"
 BRA_plead_with_the_ptb_desc: "After the political Maracanaço that was the beginning of the intra-coalition conference, it will be difficult for Kubitschek and the PSD to convince the PTB to abandon their golden boy Goulart. But the interests of the Nation and of the coalition demand unity between the two parties, and Goulart must be cast aside in order to achieve this. Therefore Kubitschek has decided to approach some of them in private and offer them funding, money, and other such perks in exchange for their support and backing. One can only hope that he will be able to convince the grandees of the Labour Party to see reason."
 BRA_people_power: "People Power"
 BRA_people_power_desc: "As a result of the achievements of his previous term - building the new capital not least among them - Kubitschek is currently quite popular with the average people of Brazil. This gives him an advantage over virtually any other candidate, as he does not need to waste any more time on introducing himself and building a reputation. Kubitschek plans to put this bully pulpit to immediate and effective use - he will make speeches and hold rallies like no one else in Brazil can to galvanize his campaign. This will have the effect of swinging some members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies towards him, since the voice of the people will naturally affect the thought processes of their representatives. "
 BRA_goularts_gamble: "Goulart's Gamble"
 BRA_goularts_gamble_desc: "After that bastard Auro de Moura Andrade blocked João Goulart from being sworn in as President of Brazil, even though constitutionally as President of the Chamber of Deputies he was the rightful successor, many gave up hope in him. But in the halls of the PTB there are many functionaries who are still saying that Goulart can still win out. As the PTB is the largest party in the House of Deputies and a major party in the Senate with socialist backing, Goulart has a solid chance of coming out of the Hundred Days' Crisis as President…\n\n...provided he can convince the PSD that Kubitschek is a lost cause and to back him instead. But that is in and of itself a great challenge; Goulart will have his work cut out for him in the upcoming days and weeks."
 BRA_approach_the_constitutionalists: "Approach the Constitutionalists"
 BRA_approach_the_constitutionalists_desc: "The Constitutionalist faction of the military are known for their loyalty to the Republic, its people, and the established democratic order. They have been very public with their expressions of confidence in the democratic process currently being undergone. Even better, they say time and again to anyone willing to listen that they have faith in our ability to weather the crisis.\n\nGoulart, relying on his connection to his former boss, the previous President, will get hold of the leaders of the Constitutionalists in order to obtain their backing - support from good men like these is a great help in any endeavor, particularly in a democratic crisis."
 BRA_adhemars_proposal: "Adhemar's Proposal"
 BRA_adhemars_proposal_desc: "That snake Adhemar de Barros, secretary to Lucifer himself, has approached the PTB leadership for some reason, offering to stand aside in favor of Goulart in exchange for what he calls something "mutually beneficial". Under any other circumstances, we would rather be thrown out of a window than cooperate with a corrupt, backstabbing good-for-nothing like Adhemar. But the times are desperate and a sword is hanging over all our heads, no matter our party affiliation. So we will talk to him and see just what this "mutual benefit" of his entails, and also learn what he and his party want in exchange for it."
 BRA_bribe_the_psd: "Bribe the PSD"
 BRA_bribe_the_psd_desc: "The PSD requires some more convincing to set Kubitschek aside and support Goulart instead. Though we have successfully cajoled a large group of them, there are significant holdouts among the more conservative members of the party. But these are desperate times in which we cannot leave anything to chance. The interests of the coalition, of democracy, of Brazil itself demand Goulart's victory, and that victory must be with total backing from both parties of the Coalition. Fortunately we happen to have reliable information that some of these naysayers are quite responsive to a dose of the good old payola; let's put that to use and thereby further unite the coalition behind Goulart. "
 BRA_the_shadow_master: "The Old Master in the shadows"
 BRA_the_shadow_master_desc: "In his political infancy, João Goulart was mentored by the Father of the Poor, the most influential President of Brazil, Getúlio Vargas himself. As a doyen of the party, his endorsement would be of significant benefit to Goulart in his effort to gain further support in both the PSD and the PTB. Moreover, it would also improve his goodwill with the populace and reduce the advantage that Kubitschek has in that area. To that end, Goulart will approach his aging mentor in an effort to gain that coveted endorsement and further improve his chances of coming out of the Hundred Days as President of the Republic."
 BRA_a_matter_of_formalities: "A Matter of Formalities"
 BRA_a_matter_of_formalities_desc: "While the first session of the congress concluded without a decision, the proceedings have finally attained a modicum of stability. Various grandees and representatives are choosing sides. Supporters high and low are beginning to coalesce around the two main contenders. Debate is raging everywhere one looks, though it is of course less vicious and polarized than it was at the disastrous beginning of the conference. If one looks more closely, however, it is clear that a decision is almost in sight. Perhaps we will at last be able to make an end and put the military threat behind us once and for all, thus bringing about a new era of good governance in the tradition of President Vargas."
 BRA_hold_the_vote: "Hold the Vote"
 BRA_hold_the_vote_desc: "The Leadership Conference of the PSD-PTB Coalition is at last nearing its close. Leaders of both parties sigh in relief as the atmosphere cools further and people finish making their decisions in a peaceful manner. A decision between these two strong candidates is quite clearly on the horizon, and the vote will be taken very soon. Let us hope that a clear verdict is reached, and that the coalition will firmly unite behind the chosen candidate, for its own good as for that of all Brazil. We have a democracy and a people to save, after all, and it's well past time we set about doing so."




######## Lacerda
 BRA_lacerda_presidency: "The Lacerda Presidency"
 BRA_lacerda_presidency_desc: "The Hundred Days' Crisis has ended with a successful decision, and Carlos Lacerda emerges from the Congresso Nacional as President of the Republic of Brazil. As he is sworn in, a weight lifts off his back, since he knows that as President he is now safe from any danger - imagined or real - that he was in beforehand. Now it's time for the new President to put the lessons he learned as Governor of Guanabara to use and apply them to Brazil as a whole, with a view on cleansing the plague that is Getulism from the Republic and its people."
 BRA_crow_flies: "The Crow Takes Flight"
 BRA_crow_flies_desc: "Lacerda knows that there are only one year left before the next election is called. Because of this he must move quickly and make every change that has to be made in order to bring prosperity and success to the nation. Time flies and the welfare of all Brazil demands that he take decisive action and make the very most of the time that he has been given. As such the President will shift himself and his government apparatus into high gear. He knows the possible cost of failure: if he doesn't do things right, the Getulists might be swept back into power, and he and his supporters will have failed in their objective for the foreseeable future."
 BRA_meet_with_us_ambassador: "Meet with the Ambassador"
 BRA_meet_with_us_ambassador_desc: "First on the agenda is a meeting with the ambassador of the United States of America here in Brazil. It is known that our close alliance with the Land of the Free in the north is one of the major factors behind Brazilian security on the international stage and success in the socioeconomic realm. As such it would be folly not to further strengthen the already-close relationship we have with the Americans. So we will approach the Americans, our democratic brethren, with the hand of friendship extended. Let's see where such a friendly gesture takes us."

 BRA_ask_ofn_observer: "Ask for Observer Status"
 BRA_ask_ofn_observer_desc: "Ever since the failed defence of Great Britain against the Hitlerite invaders, the United States and Brazil have been strategic partners. Now, in one of the few initiatives most of Brazil agrees on, Brazilian boys have fought and bled side-by-side with Americans, South Africans, and other OFN members for the preservation of freedom in Southern Africa. The next step is obvious, and Lacerda will take it rather than evasively tip-toeing around it like virtually every other politician in Brasília does. It's time to formally align Brazil with the Organization of Free Nations - let's request a well-merited and long-overdue admission to observer status with them."
 BRA_talk_at_ofn: "Speak at the OFN"
 BRA_talk_at_ofn_desc: "As we prepare to be welcomed into the American coalition, it's coming time for us to make a visit to the headquarters of the Organization of Free Nations. Lacerda will commission a top ambassador go north and meet with the good members of that noble coalition. While there, he will reaffirm the Brazilian commitment to democracy and opposition to the poisonous Nazi aggression in Africa and the world more generally. This will definitely help seal the deal in our ongoing negotiations to join the OFN, especially since we have already backed our words with actions."
 BRA_visit_washington: "Visit Washington"
 BRA_visit_washington_desc: "It has been a busy few months for Lacerda thus far. But he will not hear of taking a break while there is still work to be done. No vacations for him yet; he must at the very least see to it that Brazil has firmly ensconced itself in the Organization of Free Nations. To that end, he will visit the United States for diplomatic talks and hobnob with congressmen, delegates, and other assorted dignitaries for as long as it takes until they become as eager about Brazilian membership in the OFN as Lacerda himself is. He'd best keep a coat or two ready while he's there; Washington is pretty cold for a man used to Guanabara and the Distrito Federal."
 BRA_increase_cia_contact: "Increase CIA Contacts"
 BRA_increase_cia_contact_desc: "The United States possesses an intelligence apparatus on a scale far larger than any of us can dream of. Even with this Brazil is still potentially useful to them. It is a gateway to South America, after all, on a scale that even the Argentinians cannot hope to rival. Therefore there is much we can provide the Americans in terms of intelligence-gathering and the promotion of their interests. The US-Brazil intelligence collaboration is a fruitful relationship that has a lot to offer to both of us; common sense demands that we move to strengthen it as quickly as possible."
 BRA_joint_military_operations: "Joint Military Operations"
 BRA_joint_military_operations_desc: "Even if the United States came up short fighting against the Nazi and Japanese monstrosities, they remain a powerful military juggernaut. Their technology, esprit de corps, and tactics remain admired by countless militaries the world over, and Brazil is no exception to this. Lacerda understands the need to cooperate and learn from our American brethren. To that end, he will order the Brazilian armed forces to cooperate with America in joint military exercises. This will hopefully be a learning experience for our military."

 BRA_double_down_troops: "Double Down in South Africa"
 BRA_double_down_troops_desc: "The war against the Reichskommissariats in southern Africa continues to rage; the conflict with the three German colonial tyrannies is nowhere near over. It is clear to any observer that additional support will be required if we are to drive the so-called "Aryan master race" back from the South African border. The Republic of Brazil is proud to serve as a bulwark against the National-Socialist threat; as such, we will rise to the occasion with relish. To that end, President Lacerda, following the correct method of President Lott, will personally sign decrees authorizing further groups of volunteers for the South African Front."
 BRA_send_more_guns: "Send More Guns"
 BRA_send_more_guns_desc: "The war rages on and supplies are constantly being consumed. Without guns, of course, South Africa will have no choice but to capitulate and let the Hitlerite and Boer scum run amok. The thought of these race-deluded madmen running wild in Cape Town or Pretoria the same way they do in Burgundy or the Ukraine is an intolerable nightmare to any Brazilian with his or her head screwed on the right way. Therefore, we will do everything we can to prevent such a thing from taking place. As such, guns and other assorted materiel will follow the new wave of volunteers for the South African Front."
 BRA_skirmish_with_germans: "Skirmish with the Germans"
 BRA_skirmish_with_germans_desc: "The Brazilian Navy, having successfully handled the matter of the Lobster War, and not wanting to be outdone by the ground and air forces, has approached President Lacerda asking for greater involvement in the South African War. This proposal pleases Lacerda; he will give them something to do. Much of the American and other allied navies are caught up elsewhere; leaving a large portion of the South Atlantic empty. The Germans know this and have caused the OFN no small amount of grief in that area; however, our fresh naval forces are more than capable of beating them back. This is a good opportunity for us to flex our naval muscle and secure the South Atlantic against the Nazi-and-Boer menace."

 BRA_welcome_the_refugees: "Welcome the Refugees"
 BRA_welcome_the_refugees_desc: "With the OFN and South Africa utterly defeated in the South African War, and the bigoted, Hitler-loving Boers given legal control over the whole of South Africa, a brain drain is currently occurring as many of the former Union's best and brightest minds flee for less hostile climes.\n\nBrazil has always been a country that strives to welcome intellectuals and innovators, no matter what race they are from. After all, immigrants, beginning with King João VI himself, were instrumental in strengthening Brazil both during the Empire and during the Republic. So we will roll out the red carpet once more and welcome these people, offering them shelter in exchange for their services."
 BRA_lessons_of_defeat: "Lessons from Defeat"
 BRA_lessons_of_defeat_desc: "We must examine the strategic and tactical failures that led to the South African and OFN defeat in Africa and learn everything we possibly can from them. Doubtless there are many lessons that we will be able to put to use when the next battle comes around, and we should get to absorbing them as quickly as possible. After all, if we fail to learn from the failures of the past, what chance will we have to ensure victory against the fascists when they inevitably try to bring their degeneracy to our shores?"
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control_2: "Reassert Atlantic Control"
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control_2_desc: "Before the War began, President Lott successfully drove the Reichskommissariat vultures out of our waters, but with their recent victory in the South African War they have regained their confidence and have started to violate our maritime borders once again. This cannot be borne. Out of respect for the work of his predecessor and Admiral Toscano, and especially due to our concern for the wellbeing of Brazilian fishermen, President Lacerda will order the Brazilian Navy to sally out once again and teach the Germans a few hundred lessons in respect, with or without lethal force. By the time our sailors are done with them, they will know better than to invade our seas."

 BRA_keepers_of_the_peace: "Keepers of the Peace"
 BRA_keepers_of_the_peace_desc: "The bloody South African War has ended in a ceasefire for the time being. However, only an idiot would trust the word of a Nazi, or a Boer signature on a page. To that end, even if we recall most of our volunteers, some of them should stay behind to keep an eye on the border in case hostilities resume.\n\nThey'll also have a lot of fireworks to watch - intelligence informs us that the failure in the South African War cut the legs out from under the Reichskommissariats. It will be an interesting learning experience for us to watch members of the "superior Aryan-blooded master race" flail about like the rest of us normal human beings do after a failure like that."
 BRA_guns_for_guards: "Guns for the Border Guards"
 BRA_guns_for_guards_desc: "Though it isn't as difficult as fighting in an actual war, patrolling the entirety of the border with the Reichskommissariats is easier said than done. In particular, the guards will need quite a lot of equipment to make sure that any refugees are kept safe, and any fleeing Hitlerites kept on the other side of the border. Accordingly, vehicles, guns, and other assorted supplies will be sent to the South African-German frontier in order to ensure that the border guards are well-supplied and can watch the fireworks to their north without any worry of running out of what they need."
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control: "Reassert Atlantic Control"
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control_desc: "Before the War began, President Lott successfully drove the Reichskommissariat vultures out of our waters. However, with their recent failure in the South African War, their despair and anger has driven them to recklessness and they have started to violate our maritime borders once again. This cannot be borne. Out of respect for the work of his predecessor and Admiral Toscano, and especially due to our concern for the wellbeing of Brazilian fishermen, President Lacerda will order the Brazilian Navy to sally out once again and teach the Germans a few hundred lessons in respect, with or without lethal force.

 BRA_eradicate_the_jackboot: "Lifting the Jackboot"
 BRA_eradicate_the_jackboot_desc: "For too long the African peoples were kept under the brutal jackboot of the German colonial regime. Now, order must be kept in these restive, wartorn places. To that end, if we choose to recall any of our volunteers, a large proportion of them should stay behind to keep things stable. Moreover, we will want to send Brazilian troops to help American-OFN forces clean out the remainder of the Nazi menace, remove any non-cooperative warlords, and keep things safe and sane as Africa is guided down the slow and hard road to stability."
 BRA_arm_the_peacekeepers: "Arm the Peacekeepers"
 BRA_arm_the_peacekeepers_desc: "Though it isn't as difficult as fighting in an actual war, keeping the peace in post-German Africa will still be easier said than done. In particular, the mandates will need quite a lot of equipment, medicine, and supplies to make sure that the oppressed are uplifted, the bandits kept suppressed, the Nazis in prison, and the various guerillas and revolutionaries restrained until the correct time. Accordingly, vehicles, medicine, guns, and other assorted supplies will be sent to the OFN mandates in order to ensure that the peacekeepers are well-supplied and can successfully go about decolonization without any worry of running out of what they need."
 BRA_remind_the_pirates: "Remind the Pirates"
 BRA_remind_the_pirates_desc: "Before the Crisis of '64, President Lott successfully drove the pirates and illegal fishermen out of our waters. However, with the recent collapse of German Afrika and the anarchy that that has created, they have started to throng our seas once again. This will not be tolerated. Therefore, President Lacerda will order the Brazilian Navy to sally out once again and teach these fools a few hundred lessons in respect with authorization to use lethal force if need be. By the time our sailors are done with them, they will know better than to steal from our seas, no matter who is in charge in Brazil."

 BRA_shaking_things_up: "Shaking Things Up"
 BRA_shaking_things_up_desc: "When Lacerda served as Governor of Guanabara - that is, the chief administrator of the great city of Rio de Janeiro and first servant of its people - he shook everything up like a Chilean mega-earthquake, leaving no stone unturned, no edifice unchanged, no policy unaltered. Inefficiencies were destroyed left and right, and those who contributed to them were kicked out on the seat of their pants. This earned Lacerda the acclaim of Rio's citizens and the attention of the powers-that-be throughout the Republic. Hence, during the Hundred Days he made no secret of his plan to do the same for Brazil. Now he is President, and he will transform Brazilian domestic policy the same way he did that off Rio, once more rooting inefficiencies out left and right."
 BRA_lacerdaomics: "Lacerdanomics"
 BRA_lacerdaomics_desc: "Vargas, with his inane socialist policies such as nationalizing key industries everywhere and anywhere, single-handedly sent our nation's policy down a backslide that became a continuous downward spiral. Lacerda, an adherent of sound, prudent conservative policy, knows far better than to let such foolhardiness continue on his watch. To that end, he will begin by privatizing parts of smaller state monopolies such as Vale, the mining corporation, the steelmaker CSN, or the car manufacturer FNM, starting with smaller, less cumbersome targets in order to allow him to privatize the largest one of them all - Petrobras."
 BRA_what_vargas_did_right: "Vargas' One Success"
 BRA_what_vargas_did_right_desc: "Nationalization is a ridiculous policy, just like virtually every other socialist policy. But Lacerda is a pragmatist above all; he recognizes that some state oversight is needed if Brazil wants to assure itself some semblance of energy independence. As such, Lacerda has no choice but to give the hated Vargas credit for his prudence in this matter. While for all that it chagrins us, Petrobras must stay around, we can at least purge it of bloating and inefficiency. To that end, we will auction off underexploited mineral rights and privatize limited portions of the company."
 BRA_dismantle_the_monopoly: "Dismantle the Monopoly"
 BRA_dismantle_the_monopoly_desc: "Petrobras was the biggest travesty of the Vargas Era! It turned one of the most promising wealth-generators in Brazil into an inefficient, lumbering dinosaur straight out of a Japanese "animêção" drama. Unprofitable, corrupt, and hamstrung by bureaucracy, it is incapable of even partially exploiting the black gold within our borders. Exactly how will we profit off of our natural wealth if we're held back from exploiting it? The President thinks it is well past time for this "Godzilla" of a state monopoly to be dismantled and privatized as soon as possible!"
 BRA_scale_down_trans_amazonian: "Scale Down the Amazonian Project"
 BRA_scale_down_trans_amazonian_desc: "Lott had an inane, idealistic fantasy about "building a road through the Amazon Rainforest", and the yes-men of his administration were unwilling or unable to tell him the truth. For all its great promises of connecting the Brazilian coast to the Andes, it is in practice a massive sink of resources that has yet to yield any benefit. Accordingly, Lacerda will pull back funding from the project - for now - and auction off some of the machinery used in it in order to service the financial liabilities the previous President's foolish ambition created."
 BRA_a_few_more_cuts: "A Few More Cuts"
 BRA_a_few_more_cuts_desc: "The previous President plunged Brazil into a morass of inefficient and asinine spending - a quixotic passion project here, a misplaced investment there -  that left our financial portfolio a mess. Even the things he did right he dealt with in a financially incompetent manner; no wonder, then, that his end was as humiliating as it was. Having dealt with the Trans-Amazonian Highway project, which was the origin of the worst financial problems, we can also make some more cuts here and there to further reduce the deficit. This will put Brazil on a more stable economic trajectory that is also certain to guarantee his reelection as President."
 BRA_integrate_ccc: "Integrate the "Squads""
 BRA_integrate_ccc_desc: "Great Rio de Janeiro, like all large cities, is quite difficult to control. That is especially true if you only have a police force so comically incompetent it could trip over its own feet and end up in a satirical situation comedy. As such, during his governorship, Lacerda was left with no choice but to make use of squads of what uncharitable minds call "paramilitaries" or "militias". These people were competent and loyal, serving as Lacerda's hands and feet in his efforts to root out corruption, crime, and Getulism from the jewel that is Guanabara. Doubtless Lacerda can still find a use for these good and faithful servants now that he is President."
 BRA_protect_american_interests: "Protect American Interests"
 BRA_protect_american_interests_desc: "The interests of the Brazilian people are the first concern in Lacerda's mind. If we are to preserve the Brazilian popular interest, the American interest must be considered a close second to it. The Land of the Free to the North, the Last Best Hope of Freedom, is the source of so much of our economic success. If we give the good Yankees any cause for reproach, the entirety of our people will suffer. With this in mind, the President has declared that American interests must be protected. To that end, Lacerda will arrange to protect current American investments in Brazil as a baseline and incentive for them to keep sending investment dollars here."

 BRA_join_ofn: "Join the OFN"
 BRA_join_ofn_desc: "Lacerda is a strong believer in the concept of US-Brazil partnership. He also realizes that with the next election coming ever closer, he may not be the President anymore in a year's time. Though others may decry his decision as premature, Lacerda will now push for Brazil's admittance to the Organization of Free Nations. He will cite as his justification the unprecedented German aggression witnessed in South Africa and other places in the last two years. If the Crow must leave the skies of Brasília, he will do so having left his nest - that is, Brazil - in a secure position."

 BRA_crow_soars: "The Crow Soars"
 BRA_crow_soars_desc: "Carlos Lacerda did not expect to be president, not so soon. But when the good Lord saw fit to give him the opportunity, he took it with both hands and was able to set Brazil on a promising trajectory. He was able to ensure a close partnership with America and the OFN more generally. Even more importantly, he successfully dismantled the foolhardy policies of Vargas as much as he was able. Now, the Crow sets his eyes on the upcoming federal election with a view on winning and finishing what he has been able to start these past few years."
 BRA_crow_falters: "The Crow Falters"
 BRA_crow_falters_desc: "Carlos Lacerda did not expect to be president, not so soon. But when the good Lord saw fit to give him the opportunity, he took it with both hands and was able to set Brazil on a promising trajectory. He successfully dismantled the foolhardy policies of Vargas as much as he was able. He established close relations with America and the rest of the OFN. But he was prevented from ensuring an even closer partnership with America by the refusal of his bill in the Federal Congress. Now, the Crow sets his eyes on the upcoming federal election with a view on winning and finishing what he has been able to start these past few years. But that defeat is making him falter; he cannot help but think that the people of Brazil lack confidence in his leadership."

######## Kubitschek
 BRA_kubitschecks_return: "Kubitschek's Return"
 BRA_kubitschecks_return_desc: "In the aftermath of the chaos and misery that was the Hundred Days' Crisis, the former President Juscelino Kubitschek has once more been entrusted with the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil. Though he had always had ambitions to run for the presidency once more in 1965, the chaos set off by the lunatic Quadros has made his return all the easier. As for the new President, he is justifiably confident in his abilities; as he enters the Palácio do Planalto, he knows that he will be able to save Brazil once more, as he did the first time around."
 BRA_talk_with_the_military: "Talk with the Military"
 BRA_talk_with_the_military_desc: "The military of the Republic of Brazil is not very happy with the events of the recent Hundred Days' Crisis, which makes sense in light of their actions during that time. Fortunately for them and us, the new President is a known and tolerated variable for the armed forces. If Kubitschek wants his presidency to survive, he should leverage this fact; he knows this and has every intention of doing so. As such, he will talk to them and get them to, as the old Crook of California says, "calm the hell down" and get back to working with him as they did in the past. When that is done, Kubitschek will be able to get back to work."
 BRA_promote_soborne: "Promote the Sorbonne"
 BRA_promote_soborne_desc: "The moderate Sorbonne Faction of the Brazilian Armed Forces are of the mind that the government should be supported so long as it remains stable and does not threaten Sorbonne-held positions. The President is of the view that this is an eminently reasonable position to take, especially when one compares it to the militarists and their inane, power-hungry claims that "the people cannot be trusted to rule themselves" and "only the military can rule the country". As such, President Kubitschek will take action to promote some Sorbonne leaders in the military, thereby ensuring their support for the government."
 BRA_work_with_constitutionalist: "Work with the Constitutionalists"
 BRA_work_with_constitutionalist_desc: "The esteemed Constitutionalist Faction of the Brazilian military are genuine believers in democracy, rule of law, and the protection of the public welfare. Many of them consider themselves as little more than civilians and public servants in uniforms; this belief, as well as disgust at the alternatives, was what motivated them to defend Kubitschek's rule as President of Brazil in 1955 under the leadership of Marshals Lott and Denys. Now nearly a decade has passed and Kubitschek is President once more. Accordingly, he will work with the people that saved his hide the first time so as to ensure the safety of his second mandate."
 BRA_bring_back_golden_years: "Bring Back the Golden Years"
 BRA_bring_back_golden_years_desc: "The first mandate of President Juscelino Kubitschek is fondly remembered as a golden age of development, progress, and glory for the Republic of Brazil and its people. Countless projects that improved the welfare of the Brazilian people were built, culminating with the construction of the great city of Brasília, a glorious jewel in the crown of our nation. Now the man that brought that golden age about is back in power, and he will fight tooth and nail to bring it back about. Let there be no more crises or chaos in this glorious republic of ours, only progress, stability, and "Ordem e Progresso"!"
 BRA_fund_highway: "Fund the Highway"
 BRA_fund_highway_desc: "President Kubitschek's esteemed predecessor, President Marshal Lott, had some blunders here and there (one big one that comes to mind is giving Quadros reason to start running around and screeching like nails on a chalkboard). But the good Marshal had one brilliant idea, which President Kubitschek wholeheartedly and enthusiastically supports: the Trans-Amazonian Highway connecting Brazil to its hinterlands and to the rest of South America. Since the fall of the Lott government, this glorious project has languished for lack of resources and funding; Kubitschek will not tolerate this. As such, he will provide whatever attention or money the Highway needs."
 BRA_expand_automobile_industry: "Expand the Automobile Industry"
 BRA_expand_automobile_industry_desc: "The automobile industry of Brazil is currently prospering. It produces countless cars for the domestic and even some foreing markets. But it can make, sell, and export even more cars. President Kubitschek will pull out all the stops in order to make that happen. Government investment funds will be poured into the Brazilian car industry in order to allow the companies to expand their production lines and strengthen their export capabilities. This initiative, combined with the President's other plans, will continue to further the industrialization of Brazil and help make our Republic the workshop of the whole world."
 BRA_south_american_support: "South American Support"
 BRA_south_american_support_desc: "Our honored South American neighbors can be of great use to us. They can support us diplomatically in our local and global negotiations, which will make our dealings with the larger powers easier. They can also assist us by trading with us, which will boost both our economy and theirs. However, we are not as close with our neighbors as we should be; accordingly, we have some work to get done before we can go and ask them for their support. As such, the President has directed the foreign experts and ambassadors of Brazil to work to improve relations with all South America from Bogotá to Puerto Madryn."
 BRA_chainsaw_and_diggers: "Chainsaws and Diggers"
 BRA_chainsaw_and_diggers_desc: "The glorious project that is the Trans-Amazonian Highway needs more resources if it is to successfully cut its way through the Amazon Rainforest. This will not be feasible if the workers do not have the right equipment. Nor will it be able to continue if the project's accounts remain as lacking in investment as they are. To prevent this, President Kubitschek will earmark funds for investing money in the locality and in purchasing cutting-edge construction devices such as chainsaws, excavators, and the like. This will help ensure that the project is completed in a reasonable timeframe."
 BRA_increase_industrialisation_spending: "Increase Industrialisation Spending"
 BRA_increase_industrialisation_spending_desc: "If the Brazilian economy is to continue growing, more money must be spent on industrialization. Kubitschek wants the economy to continue growing, so he will do just that. It's a beneficial version of the domino effect really. If industrialization spending goes up, the economy will be strengthened. If the economy is strengthened, votes for the PSD will be boosted. If the PSD goes up in the polls, then Kubitschek will be re-elected. And if Kubitschek is re-elected, good governance will prevail once more, stability will persist, and we will be well-placed to build Ordem e Progresso in our nation. There is nothing - except maybe some kind of global crisis coming out of nowhere and cutting the legs out from beneath us, but how could that happen? - that can prevent this from happening."
 BRA_increase_trade_with_guyana: "Increase Trade with Guyana"
 BRA_increase_trade_with_guyana_desc: "Our northern neighbor, the Republic of Guyana, is a fairly small nation as members of the Organization of Free Nations go. But that does not diminish its importance in President Kubitschek's trade strategy. It will be very easy to make a puny, comparatively disorganized nation like that economically dependent on Brazil. If we can pull that off, that part of our northern border will be secure, and we will have significant influence over what does or does not happen in Guyana. That kind of influence is always a useful thing to have. With that aim in mind, let's start off by increasing exports and trade with them."
 BRA_visit_argentina: "Visit Argentina"
 BRA_visit_argentina_desc: "In the last century, we fought with our southern neighbors. There was constant conflict and bloodshed in territories such as Corrientes and Paraguay. Fortunately, those days are now long gone, and relations with the brethren to our south are more-or-less satisfactory. With President Kubitschek's recent directive to strengthen relations with other South American nations, Argentina has come into our sights. Close relations with them will help improve relations, settle any remaining disputes, and most importantly strengthen trade to the benefit of both our economies. To that end, President Kubitschek has decided to visit his counterpart in the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires."
 BRA_march_to_manaus: "March to Manaus"
 BRA_march_to_manaus_desc: "The Trans-Amazonian Highway is finally close to completion. After so much work, funding, and difficulties, we have managed to push the highway farther than our predecessor could have done or its opponents ever dreamed it would reach. We have come so far, but we need just one last burst of effort to finish the project and gain the credit for what was essentially Marshal Lott's idea. If we can get the highway extended to Manaus and beyond, then our efforts will not have been for nothing. Let's get on with it, for the sake of Brazil and its people."
 BRA_build_more_roads: "Build More Roads"
 BRA_build_more_roads_desc: "Roads, not railways, are what will send Brazil into the future. If we have more roads, it will incentivize people to buy more cars, thereby strengthening the car industry. If the industry is strengthened, our economy will expand and businesses will prosper even more than they already do due to the fact that we made their work easier by building roads. It is a positive feedback loop set off by the simple action of building new roads and paving over existing unpaved ones. As such, expanding the road system is a no-brainer for President Kubitschek, and he will do it. "
 BRA_ambasodorial_dinners: "Wining and Dining"
 BRA_ambasodorial_dinners_desc: "With President Kubitschek's recent directive to the foreign establishment of Brazil to strengthen relations with its fellow South American nations having yielded some fruit, it is time to go further with the charm offensive and ensure once and for all their continued support and respect for our nation. Let us call on their ambassadors and invite them to as many ambassadorial dinners as they want to attend. This will further improve their already-improved opinions of us and therefore strengthen our trade ties with our South American neighbors. To peaceful relations and trade (all in the Brazilian interest of course) - saúde!"
 BRA_all_roads_lead_to_brasilia: "All Roads Lead to Brasília"
 BRA_all_roads_lead_to_brasilia_desc: "Building roads and improving existing ones wherever the eye can see is not enough if we want a good infrastructure system. After all, what's the point of a road if it isn't connected to any other roads? As such, we must connect our new roads and highways to the national highway system and make sure these roads are connected to Brasília. The result of this will be to connect the whole nation through a reliable network of interconnected roads. When that is done, our economy will prosper even more, and everyone will praise their esteemed President Kubitschek for all his hard work."
 BRA_meet_with_petrobas: "Meet With Petrobas"
 BRA_meet_with_petrobas_desc: "Petrobras, our national oil company, is of significant importance to our nation and its economy. Founded by President Kubitschek under the wise advice of Vargas, it provides Brazil with an all-important resource: oil. Our heavy reliance on imported oil for economic development leaves us with a potential disaster in the offing if something should happen to that oil; as such, we need to expand any alternative sources within the nation. Therefore, Kubitschek will meet with the heads of Petrobras to figure out how Brazil can expand local operations that extract and refine oil so as to reduce our reliance on foreign oil sources."
 BRA_industrialize_the_north_east: "Industrialize the Northeast"
 BRA_industrialize_the_north_east_desc: "The northeast of Brazil is a region of incredible economic potential. However, it is held back from attaining this greatness by a myriad of constraints from the past. Kubitschek, on the other hand, fully recognizes the economic potential and the benefit it could bring to its citizens and the Republic of Brazil more generally. Accordingly, he will order the Finance Ministry to invest in industrialization projects in the northeast with a view on pushing that region into the modern ages. This will improve prosperity in that region, boost the Brazilian economy, and, most importantly, help Kubitschek's chances of winning the next election. "
 BRA_expand_the_dockyards: "Expand the Dockyards"
 BRA_expand_the_dockyards_desc: "Due to the circumstances in which Brazil was established, the modern Brazilian nation is possessed of a large coastline with many ports and docks scattered all across it. These sites form a major part of our import-export structure. If we expand these ports into full-fledged dockyards and trading ports, it will further strengthen our economy as more and more goods will then be able to be brought into and exported from our great nation. Let us therefore begin a campaign of investing in marine infrastructure at as many points of the Brazlilian coast as is feasible, from the Guyanese border in the far north to the Uruguayan border in the far south. "
 BRA_airports_in_reclife: "Airports in Reclife"
 BRA_airports_in_reclife_desc: "Part of our plan to improve the northwestern states of Brazil is to improve its infrastructure. We have built roads, which are well and good, but we can even further strengthen our economy by building airports and expanding those that already exist. This will incentivize international and regional air travel in the area and allow airborne trade and tourists to enter Brazil through its northwest. To that end, President Kubitschek will issue orders to build airports in and around the city of Recife, which will certainly be of use in our efforts to bring about an economic golden age in the Republic of Brazil."
 BRA_final_bills: "Final Bills"
 BRA_final_bills_desc: "In his second, caretaker term as President, appointed in the aftermath of the Hundred Days' Crisis, Juscelino Kubitschek has been able to achieve a great amount of things in his struggle to bring Brazil back to the good and prosperous days of his first term. But now the scheduled 1965 election is on its way, and Kubitschek must instead focus on winning it. Before he gets to work on getting a third term, he can pass a few more bills to further increase infrastructure and industrialization spending. Having done that, he can go and secure for his no doubt inevitable victory in the upcoming election."
 BRA_politicians_dont_die_they_fade: "Mais Uma Vez À Brecha!"
 BRA_politicians_dont_die_they_fade_desc: "Juscelino Kubitschek has once more attained the pinnacle of BrazIlian political power, after having gotten so much done for his people the first time around. For him, the opportunity to once more bring about a golden age for his country was too great to pass up; that is why he chose to throw his hat into the ring when the presidential succession collapsed.\nWhen he succeeded, beating out the other candidates, he was able to bring about another economic boom on a level that only he had been previously able to achieve. But the best is yet to come; "JK" is not just kidding when he says that he will turn Brazil into an industrialized powerhouse and a juggernaut on the world stage. So as the election approaches, Kubitschek dreams of bringing glory to his people and to himself, and thinks, "Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more.""


######## Goulart

 BRA_legacy_of_vargas: "The Legacy of Vargas"
 BRA_legacy_of_vargas_desc: "As João Goulart emerges from the Hundred Days' Crisis as the President of Brazil, he reflects on his journey to this stage. He remembers his duty to the people of Brazil, and how best to serve it. He reminds himself that he is the true heir of Getúlio Vargas and the most powerful promoter of his mentor's policies today. He supported Varguist policies from the start, and will keep supporting them throughout his career. But he also reminds himself that he is his own man, and has his own brain, replete with its own ideas. With all that going through his mind, he walks into the Palácio do Planalto for his first day on the job."
 BRA_deal_with_smear_campaign: "Deal with the Smear Campaign"
 BRA_deal_with_smear_campaign_desc: "The first issue at hand at the start of Goulart's Presidency is a massive smear campaign being directed at him before he has even started to get to work. As expected, it is the conservative faction under Lacerda and Adhemar that is the spearhead of this slander; somewhat more surprising, but not completely unexpected, is that people from the PSD have joined the Crow and the Bull in this nonsense.\n\nAll this is a significant problem; they are weakening support for Goulart from around the country before he can prove himself. Decisive and quick action is required if this is to be stopped."
 BRA_a_caretaker_government: "A Caretaker Government"
 BRA_a_caretaker_government_desc: "These days we have heard a loud, annoying old crow cawing at the top of its lungs, sometimes in the National Congress, sometimes from its nest in Guanabara. Its cacophony seems to consist of repeated false claims that the new President is a catspaw of that lunatic Amazonas and his insane communists. To counter that annoying and malicious noise, President Goulart will publicly proclaim that this new government is simply a caretaker regime until the next election. He will make this even clearer by promising stability and healing, not insane policy adventures. After all, Goulart is a labourist, not a communist; a reformist, not a crazed radical."
 BRA_talk_to_military: "Talk to the Military"
 BRA_talk_to_military_desc: "More concerning than the noise-making of overgrown ravens in Rio is the rumblings of military dissatisfaction in barracks and bases throughout the Republic. There is constant talk of using force to disperse a regime that they think does not suit their interests. Worse yet, they are beginning to act out their dislike for us; during the Hundred Days, in a clear show of force the military occupied an airport for no inherent reason and then left without doing anything. They claimed that this was a planned wargame, but the civilian authorities in the Ministry of Defense had no advance notice of this. If we wish to prevent this kind of show of force from becoming more than mere show, we must nip it in the bud. President Goulart will meet with the military leaders in an effort to calm them down."
 BRA_deal_with_energy_crisis: "Deal with the Energy Crisis"
 BRA_deal_with_energy_crisis_desc: "There is currently an energy crisis ravaging the Republic of Brazil. For many of the less fortunate in our country, energy is too expensive to purchase, forcing them to live under blackout conditions. For many people in remote regions, the power plants simply aren't there. This will not be tolerated. Though President Goulart is ruling as a caretaker president, he cannot just sit around while this crisis rages on. To that end, he will take decisive action to put an end to this crisis and bring good, reliable energy to all the people of the Republic of Brazil. "
 BRA_expand_the_franchise: "Expand the Franchise"
 BRA_expand_the_franchise_desc: "Our Republic is supposedly "democratic", but there is very good reason to doubt this when the illiterate, low-ranking military officers, and other marginalized groups are denied the vote. This cannot be borne; how can we claim to be a "free nation" if we fail even the most basic criterion of universal voting? Accordingly, President Goulart will expand the franchise to give everyone the vote, in order to promote the interests of democracy generally......and the interests of the PTB more narrowly. After all, if someone has enfranchised you, you will want to give back to him, won't you?"
 BRA_gain_american_support: "Gain American Support"
 BRA_gain_american_support_desc: "The Goulart Presidency that has emerged from the aftermath of the Hundred Days Crisis is besieged on multiple fronts. There is a constant risk of concerted political attack from the opposition UDN; this could even suffice to topple his government. Even worse than that is the ever-present threat of a military coup, which has not abated even after Frota's demand for a new President was met within the timeframe. If the new President wants to remain in power, he will need the support of a major foreign power to frighten the UDN and would-be military junta leaders in check; the Americans and their Organization of Free Nations are perfect for this."
 BRA_meet_with_denys: "Meet with Denys"
 BRA_meet_with_denys_desc: "If the Goulart Administration is to survive into the next election, it will require backing from enough powerful military figures to counterbalance the pro-coup faction. Marshal Odílio Denys is a potential option; he is a close friend of the former President and Goulart's mentor, President  Lott, and a man that stands between the Constitutionalists and Sorbonne Faction. Moreover, he cooperated with Marshal Lott to ensure a peaceful transition of power between Kubitschek and his predecessor. Now that Goulart thinks of it, the Marshal may be just the right man Goulart needs to back him until the next elections. Accordingly, Goulart will approach the good Marshal and see what he wants in exchange for his support."
 BRA_visit_washington_dc: "Visit Washington"
 BRA_visit_washington_dc_desc: "If the new President wants to remain in power, he will need the support of a major foreign power to frighten the UDN and keep would-be military junta leaders in check; the Americans and their Organization of Free Nations are just what we need for this. But we cannot expect them to give us their support without something in return; we need to get hold of them as soon as possible and ask them what it would take to help prop up our government. The President must hurry to Washington D.C. as fast as the plane can take him. After all, a coup or political crisis could come tomorrow morning, if not sooner."
 BRA_constituationalist_backers: "Constitutionalist Backers"
 BRA_constituationalist_backers_desc: "The Constitutionalist Faction of the Brazilian Armed Forces is, as you would expect, constitutionalist. What does this mean? They support the constitution, democracy, and government in service to the people. While the autocrats in the rest of the Brazilian military were busy occupying airports and making unsubtle noises of disapproval everywhere they went, the Constitutionalists paid due respect to their elected President, and made their support for the democratic order clear. Let us foster this already-positive relationship in order to secure us a useful ally for the rest of our mandate."
 BRA_leave_them_alone: "Leave Them Alone"
 BRA_leave_them_alone_desc: "It is true that there are many rebellious officers, and that they want nothing more than the destruction of the government. The recent airport occupation is the clearest sign of this terrible fact. But President Goulart knows that his government is unstable, and that a single wrong move could risk everything that he has managed to build. Accordingly, taking the advice of his predecessor, General Lott, he will leave these nuisances alone for the time being until and unless they do anything untoward. After all, if the President doesn't rock the boat, what possible reason could the hardliners have to coup him?"
 BRA_crush_rebelious_officers: "Crush Rebellious Officers"
 BRA_crush_rebelious_officers_desc: "There are many rebellious officers, and they want nothing more than the destruction of the government. The recent political crisis is the clearest sign of this terrible fact. The continuation of this sedition cannot and will not be tolerated. To that end, the President has laid out a plan to remove the would-be autocrats from the officer corps in order to crush the anti-government, antidemocratic sentiments that threaten his government. But he must be careful. If he executes the operation incompetently, this could go wrong; in fact, it might even provoke a coup instead of preventing it."
 BRA_fund_electrical_infrastructure: "Fund Electrical Infrastructure"
 BRA_fund_electrical_infrastructure_desc: "In Brazil, nine out of ten favelas are devoid of major electrical infrastructure. The one favela remaining in that sample does have electricity, but it is unsafely and unreliably connected. The UDN, laboring as always under their free-market delusions about "the invisible hand of the market" and "personal responsibility", would just leave these poor people unconnected to the grid. But President Goulart is not them; he actually cares about the poor. Accordingly, he will take decisive action to invest in electrical infrastructure, so as to connect both the urban and rural poor to the electrical grid; this will certainly help uplift them."
 BRA_form_eletrobras: "Form Eletrobras"
 BRA_form_eletrobras_desc: "Compounding the energy crisis in Brazil is the fact that a substantial fraction of the electrical infrastructure is owned by foreign corporations. The President and the PTB find this unacceptable; exactly why should foreign vultures be allowed to profit off of forcing Brazilian men and women to pay for a basic necessity? Accordingly, the President will have the Brazilian Congress to nationalize the electrical corporations in order to provide electricity at low cost to the people. The UDN may caw and scream in opposition on hearing of this "anti-capitalist" action, but their opinion is neither here nor there. This must be done."
 BRA_meet_kubitshcheks: "Meet Kubitschek"
 BRA_meet_kubitshcheks_desc: "While Juscelino Kubitschek was President he sympathized with the ideals under which our government is being run. While he and Goulart initially competed against each other during the Hundred Days' Crisis, those days are now thankfully over, and good governance has triumphed over militarism and the UDN's folly. It is now time for all parties of goodwill to cooperate for the welfare of Brazil, and the PSD and PTB understand this very clearly. To that end, President Goulart will meet with his predecessor in order to gain his support - and therefore that of the PSD - for the reforms that he has proposed and intends to propose in the foreseeable future."
 BRA_present_bill: "A Vote for the Voters"
 BRA_present_bill_desc: "The bill has been created and we have put everything we want to put in it. The unreserved support of Senhor Kubitschek and the PSD for it has been secured. The PTB is unified behind their President and his proposed policies. Of course, there will be opposition. The largest instance of this is the UDN and the large, overgrown starling perched on its collective head, who will of course start cawing, shaking, and screeching like a murder of crows being shot at by an anti-aircraft gun. They will wail about "damaging the Brazilian economy" and "incitements to fraud", but Goulart does not care. The bill will pass one way or another."
 BRA_counter_lacerda: "Counter Lacerda"
 BRA_counter_lacerda_desc: "This whole time, that cowbird in the Congresso Nacional has been spreading propaganda all over the place against Goulart, the PTB, and the whole government. Since he has nothing better to do with his life, he sits there screeching about the current "quasi-communistic fascist" (Really? Communist AND fascist? What illiteracy.) regime ruling in Brazil. But Lacerda, too busy trying to pull what he thinks is a plank out of our eyes, forgets that he himself has a big old tree straight out of Rondônia sticking out of his own eye. President Goulart will endeavor to remind the Brazilian people of his opponent's flaws."
 BRA_combat_illliteracy: "Combat Illiteracy"
 BRA_combat_illliteracy_desc: "Illiteracy is a major problem in the Republic of Brazil. It holds back everything - it prevents our workforce from understanding instructions, it prevents the less fortunate from uplifting themselves, and it even prevents people from exercising their rights as Brazilian citizens. This cannot be borne; how will we begin to compete on the same level as the various great powers of the world if our people cannot even read and write? President Goulart is resolved, the literacy rate will rise while he is in power. Let a literacy campaign be begun in all the states of Brazil."
 BRA_increase_minimum_wage: "Increase Minimum Wage"
 BRA_increase_minimum_wage_desc: "The initial reforms that have been passed are well and good, but they do not go far enough to improve the welfare of the average Brazilian. Take the minimum wage, for instance. True, it is currently fairly high as these things go. But it is not enough to match the rising inflation that is gouging holes in everyone's pockets these days. Common sense demands that this problem be countered as quickly as possible. To that end, Goulart will arrange to raise the minimum wage by an amount sufficient to improve the average João's quality of life."
 BRA_work_with_psd: "Work with the PSD"
 BRA_work_with_psd_desc: "Now is a time for all parties of goodwill to cooperate for the welfare of Brazil, and the PSD and our PTB understand this very clearly. It is because of this that we were able to secure the support of Senhor Kubitschek and the PSD for our recent reforms. Even without this, however, the PSD and PTB have been allied with one another in the legislature and in Brazilian politics more generally since the era of President Vargas; the conflict of the Hundred Days' Crisis was very much an exception to the norm.\n\nPresident Goulart recognizes this; to this end, he will work to improve ties and mend bridges with the good politicians of the PSD. This will make his re-election campaign much easier as the revived PSD-PTB coalition, rather than fighting within itself, unifies against external threats."
 BRA_attack_udn: "Focus on the UDN"
 BRA_attack_udn_desc: "The conservative lunatics of the UDN, led by a clamoring mynah bird possessed of neither tact nor human decency, have given us no amount of grief for the past half-decade. First they sabotaged the promising presidency of General Lott, then they caused no small amount of grief during the Hundred Days' Crisis, then for good measure they slandered the President and his party every chance they got. Now an election is imminent, and they are our main rival. If we wish to protect the welfare of the Brazilian state, they must be defeated. As such President Goulart and the PTB strategists have earmarked much of our campaign resources to pulling the UDN down a notch or two."
 BRA_attack_psd: "Distance from the PSP"
 BRA_attack_psd_desc: "The PSP, though a smaller party than the UDN, is still potentially a major contender in the coming election. A politician on campaign must always keep an eye out for potential threats, even one as small as the PSP. Accordingly, the President has directed his strategists and operatives to make sure to attack the PSP at the same or similar level of intensity as they do the UDN. The result of this will be to weaken the PSP's credibility relative to ours, which will doubtless help us improve our chances of winning in the upcoming election."
 BRA_jango_gamble: "Jango's Gamble"
 BRA_jango_gamble_desc: "Many people in Brazil have begun to refer to the upcoming election as "Jango's Gamble" as "Jango" Goulart moves to wager it all on continuing his rule as President. President Goulart will take a page from the book of the late lamented Vice-President of the United States and go on national television to take questions from the Brazilian people, in an effort to further boost his support. If this goes well, and his answers please the people, it could assure him victory. But if it goes poorly, it could lead to disaster in the upcoming polls. The atmosphere will doubtless be tense."

######## Adhemar

 BRA_dark_horse_rises: "The Dark Horse Rises"
 BRA_dark_horse_rises_desc: "To the surprise and concern of countless Brazilians (and some particularly educated foreigners), Adhemar de Barros, the Bull of São Paulo, has emerged from the Hundred Days' Crisis as President of the Republic of Brazil. Of the available candidates, he was always the dark horse. This is reflected by the fact that every pundit, journalist, political gambler, expert, and other intellectual was united in saying that the odds of his winning out were near to zero.\nAdhemar, laughing in all their faces, has instead taken power and is now the tenant of the Palácio do Planalto. But as he walks into his new home to take over from his predecessor, he realizes just how weak his grasp on power is. He's going to have his work cut out for him if he wants to stay around."
 BRA_calm_military: "Calm the Military"
 BRA_calm_military_desc: "The Armed Forces of Brazil and their leadership, as one might expect, are annoyed at the current state of Brazilian politics. As is well-known, this annoyance at the antics of incompetent civilians was what set off the Hundred Days' Crisis. They are also fairly annoyed with Adhemar's antics, which to them are "absurd" (heh). But Adhemar doesn't have time to fall victim to a coup d'état - he's too busy getting used to all the perks of being the President of Brazil (and also the duties... sometimes). As such, the generals and assorted military riff-raff need to be fobbed off. Adhemar knows only one method, and it is remarkably effective: the old Suborno Method, also known as bribery."
 BRA_wage_increases: "Token Wage Increases"
 BRA_wage_increases_desc: "Now at the bottom of it all, the good men of the Brazilian Armed Forces really just want to provide for themselves and their families, and leave a good legacy behind for their children. Our honorable President is a decent man in his own right who understands this situation far more than many do and sympathizes with their plight. For this reason, a wage increase for the military must be pushed through for their sake and that of their families… and also to secure their goodwill for when President Adhemar needs them in turn."
 BRA_extra_military_founding: "Extra Military Funding"
 BRA_extra_military_founding_desc: "Sure, we have raised the wages of military officials, but that does not go far enough. We must also try to show the military itself some love so that they will leave us alone for longer. To that end, let us set aside more funding for the armed forces so they can afford to work on their pet projects such as their strange and wonderful guns, their fancy new boats, and fast and novel aircraft designs. God willing, this will work out like a crying child that calms down when given a toy: keeping them distracted, preventing them from trying to throw the President's fledgling government down."
 BRA_adhemar_dine_generals: "Dine with the Generals"
 BRA_adhemar_dine_generals_desc: "Having thrown money at both the military and its officers in order to shut them up, it seems that they have taken the hint and calmed down. This is not enough, to Adhemar's view; he now believes that he has to build personal connections with prominent members of the military. Accordingly, Adhemar will call on some of the more prominent and malleable generals and officers of the Brazilian Armed Forces, such as Amaury Kruel and Ernesto Geisel, and try to build close personal relationships with them. Hopefully such connections will help make them loyal, if not to the constitutional order, then at least to Adhemar de Barros personally."
 BRA_military_parade: "Military Parades"
 BRA_military_parade_desc: "Everyone and his mother-in-law knows that the military is one of the few things that is respected in this tormented Republic of ours. As such, honoring them and helping make sure they get the respect they deserve is equivalent to strengthening the Brazilian state's integrity. A start in this direction is military outreach, and what better method of that is there than ten or twenty good old-fashioned military parades? Sending the military out to show off in front of the Brazilian people will gain the respect and support of not just the common folk, but the military as well."
 BRA_meet_oligarchs: "Meet with the Oligarchs"
 BRA_meet_oligarchs_desc: "Adhemar is no typical oligarch. Before his presidency he tended to give that type of person a wide berth, since he disliked them for various reasons. For now, however, Adhemar has decided to set his dislike of the oligarchs and other assorted moneyed elites aside, because likes and dislikes are not important before the most important thing in Adhemar's life: his reelection. He knows how important these people will be to his victory in the upcoming election; for that reason, he will sit down and talk with the cattle barons, coffee kings, bankers, and other assorted wealthy types, gain their support and funding, and put them to use for his own needs."
 BRA_chat_cattle_barons: "Chat with the Cattle Barons"
 BRA_chat_cattle_barons_desc: "The cattle barons - owners and proprietors of vast ranches throughout the rural interior of our Republic, have significant sway in the regions where their cattle roam. Getting hold of them and convincing them to back the new President will be critical to the success of his reelection plan. Moreover, their backing could be the difference between glorious victory and humiliating defeat for the various PSP candidates in those regions, for both the State and Federal Legislatures. To that end, Adhemar de Barros will call on the cattle barons and see what they want or need in exchange for their support for the PSP."
 BRA_meet_french_elite: "Meet with the French Elite"
 BRA_meet_french_elite_desc: "The "French Elites'' are ethnically French Brazilians of middle- and upper-class extraction. Most of them fled from the French mainland to Brazil when the German devil-worshippers, invading the Last French Republic during Fall Gelb and Fall Rot, reduced the once-proud French nation to a shadow of its ancient glory, turning it into first a pathetic puppet and then into that thrice-damned antichrist Himmler's personal torture chamber. By God and His Mother, it is a terrible fate for a nation that was once the originator of so many great things. At least we have managed to provide a comparatively decent new home for these poor people… but now we need something from them - their political support.\nOur current president is in a unique position to get this something from them; a fluent French speaker, he can get hold of them and get their support for his venture; backing from a group as powerful and wealthy as this will be of great use."
 BRA_invite_galloue: "Invite de Gaulle"
 BRA_invite_galloue_desc: "The French elites are not the only Francophones who we can approach. There is also the pitiful Republican remnant on the West African coast, led by General Charles de Gaulle. Though they are an outdated relic of a past long dead, they are doubtless still useful to those they are convinced to assist.\nFor instance, even a token meeting and photo-op with the General will be more than sufficient to gain the support of the influential French expatriates. Let us do that and help increase Adhemar's chances of holding on to power.\nWhat? The Vichy French will be irritated by this? Who cares? What will that Poujeb or whatever in God's name they call him do about it? Come back to me when there's an actual threat!"
 BRA_increase_envelope_system: "Increase the Envelope System"
 BRA_increase_envelope_system_desc: ""The 'Envelope System' is simply a sophisticated euphemism for bribery. This system, like any other system, is versatile and can be used for various purposes, be those gaining power, wealth, influence, or reputation.\nIn today's lecture President Adhemar de Barros of Brazil, an internationally recognized practitioner of the Envelope System, will demonstrate the correct use of the Envelope System in gaining power. He will demonstrate its effect on the mind by testing it on people in São Paulo, and show the benefits it offers by requesting people's votes in exchange for the envelope.""
 BRA_money_from_rich: "Migration to the City of Rain"
 BRA_money_from_rich_desc: "São Paulo - the City of Rain - is Adhemar's hometown and his main base of support. Increasing migration to it (and further developing it so it can welcome the people that are sent its way) will increase its development and contribution to the Brazilian economy. For Adhemar it is a simple "positive feedback loop", as it is called - more migration to the City of Rain equals more development equals more PSP voters equals more time in the Presidency for him. And more time under the wise rule of Senhor Rouba-mas-Faz is a good thing… right?"
 BRA_populist_policies: "Populist Policies"
 BRA_populist_policies_desc: "Populist policies will be of great help to Adhemar in his plan to gain further support from the Brazilian people so that he can be re-elected to a full term. After all, populism is a vote-winner on a scale that other methods can only dream to achieve. Sure, this won't be all that great for the economy. But as Keynes, paraphrasing a long line of thinkers going all the way back to the Holy Writ, once said: "in the end, we will all die". Keynes concluded that the damage caused by populist spending (if there even was any) mattered little in comparison to the rest of time; Adhemar, a cultured and literate man, agrees completely with this conclusion. "
 BRA_decrease_taxes: "Decrease Some Taxes"
 BRA_decrease_taxes_desc: "One plank of Adhemar's populist platform is cutting down on various taxes. If taxes are cut, that means that people will have to spend less. If people are made to spend less due to such a tax cut, they will remember and bless the man who brought it about. And if people remember and bless a politician for the good that he has done for them, they will vote for him. As such, it is really a no-brainer to cut taxes at least until the next election. Concerns about funding are rubbish; the economy will cope, as it has done from the time of His Late Majesty the Emperor.  "
 BRA_raise_welfare: "Raise Some Welfare"
 BRA_raise_welfare_desc: "Raising welfare is another plank of Adhemar's populist reelection plan. Increasing welfare spending will put more money in the pockets of the poor. This, combined with the cut taxes, will unquestionably allow them to bring more wealth to their families. From there, it is much the same as with the tax cuts. The poor are already a major part of Adhemar and the PSP's voting base; this measure will make them even more loyal to and enthusiastic for their esteemed President, allowing him to ride their votes to another term in the Palácio do Planalto."
 BRA_sway_media: "Sway the Media"
 BRA_sway_media_desc: "For all that Adhemar has striven to bring about peace, order, and good government to the Republic of Brazil in the aftermath of the Hundred Days' Crisis, there are still countless members of the Fourth Estate of the Nation - the journalistic class - that oppose the Adhemar presidency. This cannot be borne; if every single newspaper, radio show, and television program is denouncing the President in one way or another, what relevance will his policies carry, and what hope does he have of winning a vote? At that point Adhemar could throw himself in front of a train to save a child and people wouldn't know it.\nFortunately for his chances of reelection, Adhemar knows how to talk with these people. By sitting down with some of them, he can reason with them and get them to support him. And, as has been demonstrated, if - God forbid - basic reasoning goes flop (it often does with these types) the Envelope System is a useful fail-safe."
 BRA_tour_country: "Tour the Country"
 BRA_tour_country_desc: "Our President is not a bland, uninspiring man that has to rely on surrogates and ghost-writers to get his point across. Quite the contrary: Adhemar de Barros is a flamboyant individual possessed of a loud speaking voice, an impressive look on television, and a playful, attention-grabbing style of oration. His confident exterior, which is the perfect combination of intelligence and brashness will be perfect for him as he strives to make more Brazilians see him - and not some fool from a different party - as the right leader for the times that the Republic finds itself in."
 BRA_aid_poor: "Aid the Poor"
 BRA_aid_poor_desc: "Aiding the poor is one more major part of Adhemar's reelection plan. As we have established, increasing welfare spending and cutting taxes are one major way in which the poorer people of our Republic, already fairly favorable to the current President, will be convinced to re-elect him. But there are other ways in which the Government of Brazil can put itself at the service of the poor, and Adhemar will direct it to do so as quickly as possible before the votes start being cast.\nThough he will claim to anyone who questions him that he is doing this out of a Christian concern for the welfare of the people, it is obvious to most people why he is really doing this. But what does that matter to Adhemar, if he wins the Presidency and is free to play at being Rouba-mas-Faz for another five years?"
 BRA_urban_slums: "The Urban Slums"
 BRA_urban_slums_desc: "The urban slums - favelas and other such hotbeds of poverty, despair, and misery - are usually shunned by the educated upper classes, in particular by politicians. Adhemar is not a normal politician. Nor does he hold the poor in their huts and hovels as being beneath him or unworthy of his notice.\nAccordingly, as he has done before, he will enter these slums (accompanied by some bodyguards, obviously; can one be too cautious?) and talk to the people. He will promise them the moon, show his successes, and gain their support and votes. The hesitant can of course be inducted into the Envelope System, of which Senhor Adhemar is a veteran practitioner and promoter."
 BRA_rural_towns: "The Rural Towns"
 BRA_rural_towns_desc: "Rural towns and their associated localities are filled to the brim with the exact sort of person that would be swayed by Adhemar's personality and his manner of speaking. In a previous gubernatorial election in São Paulo, the madman Quadros was defeated by Adhemar because while Quadros paid these areas no mind, Adhemar willingly went and sought support there. It has worked once; as such, Adhemar has very good reason to hope that it will happen once again. So he will go back to these towns for a second time, using the same method as in the favelas: promise the moon, show some successes, gain support and votes, deploy the Envelope System as necessary."
 BRA_decrease_interest_rates: "Decrease Interest Rates"
 BRA_decrease_interest_rates_desc: "Decreasing interest rates is the last major part of Adhemar's reelection plan. If we cut the interest rate, this will allow the Brazilian people to borrow more for less interest, thus effectively putting more money in their pockets. Granted, it may result in a further rise in inflation, building off the inflation set off by Juscelino Kubitschek's building mania that culminated in the construction of the new capital, but that does not matter to Adhemar. What matters right now is the short term, and all short-term indications are that this is for the best."
 BRA_victory_approches: "Victory Approches"
 BRA_victory_approches_desc: "Adhemar de Barros has done everything he can. He has gained the support of the military and assorted elites, wooing the generals and convincing the French expatriates. He has played the economy like the organ of the Catedral da Sé in São Paulo in order to gain public support and fire up his voting base. With all this done, who in their right mind can doubt that Adhemar and his vice-presidential candidate will win the Presidency? True, Henrique Lott's daughter is proving to be remarkably popular as the vice-presidential candidate for the PSD-PTB coalition, but surely she - being after all a mere woman - cannot defeat a good, competent man chosen by Senhor Rouba-mas-Faz, who has stabilized the Brazilian nation after the disaster Edna Lott's father caused.\nRight?"

 ## Quadros
BRA_now_onto_the_hard_part: "Now Onto the Hard Part"
BRA_now_onto_the_hard_part_desc: "A great disaster befell the Brazilian common man when the conservatives of the UDN failed to win the 1960 elections. Quadros campaigned hard for a return to fiscal sanity, for an end of the corrupt Kubitschek era where the rich and corrupt feasted as the common laborer toiled, burdened by ever increasing debt and inflation. Many thought that Sr Quadros would languish in the vice-presidency, forced to stand aside as graft and malfeasance bled the nation from a thousand wounds.\n\nNo more! Lott's own misdeeds have brought him low, and we now hold onto the presidency. Our enemies, the enemies of all Brazilians, are currently shocked at our ascension. They will rapidly recover, and their stupor will turn to anger. We must stabilize our position, so that the presidency can be turned once more into a lighthouse, a great beacon of order and progress for our great nation! Leeches and parasites shall tremble!"
BRA_establishing_the_cabinet: "Establishing the Cabinet"
BRA_establishing_the_cabinet_desc: "No man can rule alone. President Quadros has thus turned his attention to the Cabinet. Our current ministers are all leftover from the Lott era. True to their patron saint, these mens are all either corrupt, lazy or crypto-communists. Perhaps all three, for deficiencies in moral characters often compound, dragging men further and further into the abyss.\n\nOur president is a good man. For the nation's sake, these relics of the past have to go. In their place, hard working and earnest politicians will be brought forward. The coming days will be difficult for Quadros' presidency. As our enemies are numerous, we must not risk any threat from within."
BRA_calm_the_military: "Calm the Military"
BRA_calm_the_military_desc: "Due to his military background, president Lott might have fancied himself a new Caesar. Now, his comrades within the army accuse us of having betrayed him in our very own ides of march. The army's men, both constitutionalist and otherwise, are displeased to see a civilian be president.\n\nThis restored Brazilian democracy is young. The fifth constitution has been damaged by Lott's misdeeds. It is crucial that we convince the army not to end democracy, not to seize power once more.  We must genuflect, kow-tow and beg for patience and understanding. Perhaps the greedy commanders will ask for a little extra money, for their understanding. President Quadros understands that no price is too high, no humiliation too ignominious, for us to risk the golden path to a better Brazil!"
BRA_apologies_and_compromises: "Apologies and Compromises"
BRA_apologies_and_compromises_desc: "Army officers have so far scoffed at our attempts to open negotiation. In the barracks, president Quadros is mocked as an eccentric paperpusher, a man far too arrogant in his own abilities. The thought of giving legitimacy to a self-important politico is too much for the proud soldiers of our armed forces.\n\nThough it pains president Quadros to give some ground to those who would threaten democracy, it is the only way forward. The president will apologize to the army for Lott's downfall. During this show of contrition, he will present himself as an humble servant of the people, who knew not the best course of action when dealing with such unprecedented corruption.\n\nA show of penitence and repentance, as well as a dialling down of our criticism of Lott himself, will go a long way toward the military giving us a chance."
BRA_pay_rise_for_the_officer: "Pay Raises for the Officers"
BRA_pay_rise_for_the_officer_desc: "Time is of the essence to secure our control of the presidency. The men of the armed force cannot only be won over through words. Actions will be required.\n\nPrevious presidents were loath to extend their graft and nepotism to the army. A laudable precaution, perhaps born from their avarice and fear of a resurgent military. Nevertheless, the proud men in uniforms could use a slight pay rise. Especially those in the officer's corps who have shown themselves to be of a ... magnanimous disposition toward the president.\n\nOur hearts weep at the tought of extending the despicable network of corruption to new areas. Yet we must be forced by these extraordinary circumstances to take up damned arms. The nation's redemption is at stake!"
BRA_dealing_with_vipers: "Dealing with Vipers"
BRA_dealing_with_vipers_desc: " Carlos Lacerda, and Adhemar de Barros. Among the brave few who followed our president in his opposition to Lott. Men of admirable convictions, perhaps. But in the halls of power, bravery and convictions are mere illusions, flamboyant garments meant to hide daggers.\n\nIt has not escaped president Quadros' attention that Adhemar and Lacerda's support for Lott's removal has had very little to do with the good of the nation, and very much to do with both men's ambitions. Lacerda is desperate to get out from his role as junior coalition partner to our party. Meanwhile, the perfidious Adhemar seeks to extend his empire of corruption to ever greater heights. As soon as either of them smell the slightest weakness, their allegiances will no doubt shift again.\n\nWe must take the fight to these two vipers before it is too late!"
BRA_lacerdas_hypocrisy: "Lacerda's Hypocrisy"
BRA_lacerdas_hypocrisy_desc: " Lacerda has long claimed to be a conservative, and an ally of all Brazilians. His convictions allegedly led him to support a shabby coup attempt in the fifties. HIs political prestige hurt by his failure, Lacerda saw the UDN bleeding support to our own PTN. Lacerda bent the knee and entered into a coalition with us as a junior partner. Having forced himself into a loveless marriage, Lacerda still thinks he can be master of his own destiny. During Lott's downfall, Lacerda and his cronies tried to implicate then vice-president Quadros. This betrayal at the most dangerous of times has not been forgotten. Nor has it been forgiven.\n\nWe will outmaneuver this treasonous rat and turn all of his followers away from him. Lacerda, in trying to salvage his future, has damned himself to disgrace and obscurity."
BRA_expose_the_crows_lie: "Expose the Crow's Lies"
BRA_expose_the_crows_lie_desc: "Lacerda is a devious creature, lying as thoughtlessly as others breathe. We have kept tabs on the man's countless fabulations with grim fascination. Lacerda rests now at the center of  a web of contradictory lies told to many, many members of the political class. All that is needed is a little push to ensnare this cawing crow in his own hypocrisy.\n\nLacerda, a former journalist, knows the power of the press. We will remind him of the media's power by arranging for the publication of Lacerda's lies all over the country. When the entire nation knows of our rival's two faced nature, they will no doubt recoil in disgust and abandon him en masse."
BRA_adhemars_corruption: "Adhemar's Corruption"
BRA_adhemars_corruption_desc: "Of the myriad beasts preying on good citizens through the nation's highest offices, Adhemar is one of the most well known to our president. An schemer of ill repute, a colossally corrupt scoundrel and an arrogant man, Adhemar certainly remembers his early conflicts with President Quadros over the governorship of São Paulo. This man can not be trusted.\n\nAdhemar's supporters claim that for all the corruption surrounding the man, Adhemar at least get things done. The plan to get rid of him is simply to let the whole nation known of his corruption. After all, once this charlatan's reputation has been dragged through the mud, there will be very few opportunities for him to steal, and fewer still to try to sell us out for his personal benefit. The nation deserves, nay, needs to know the danger of letting Adhemar continue his schemes."
BRA_raid_his_office: "Raid His Office"
BRA_raid_his_office_desc: "Adhemar's natural habitat is muck, and he is thus a slippery critter, able to evade justice again and again. His corruption schemes are often nestled one within the other, with a dizzying array of front businesses, cat's paws and secret bank accounts. If we're to win, we must strike everywhere all at once.\n\nBy raiding his office, seizing documents and ransacking any safe we find, we will ensure that at least some evidence will end up in our custody. Cautious advisors within president Quadros' circles warn that Adhemar is not likely to be taken out of action so easily. Their prudence, while laudable, do little to affect our president's ardent desire for justice. The scoundrel Adhemar will have his day in the courts!"
BRA_the_diplomatic_shuffle: "The Diplomatic Shuffle"
BRA_the_diplomatic_shuffle_desc: "All nations live in the shadow of the second world war, where the old great powers of France and England were shattered. America, once seemingly destined to global hegemony, saw its position challenged in the Atlantic by Germany and in the Pacific by the Japanese. And yet the North American republic continues to steer the continent's nations as though nothing has changed.\n\nBrazil has no quarrel with America. Nor with Germany. Nor with the Japanese. All three great powers seek to determine the world's destiny through their schemes. Yet none of the great powers' means are unlimited. President Quadros knows that Brazil would be better served be through an independent foreign policy than by fiendish loyalty to America. The Americans will for once have to do some courtship of our nation, forced to outbid the Japanese and German efforts. Through this neutral policy Brazil's strength and prestige will only increase."
BRA_withdraw_from_south_africa: "Withdraw from South Africa"
BRA_withdraw_from_south_africa_desc: "President Quadros has long been a critique of interventionism. Of particular concern to him is the American giant to the north, willing to trample over other nations whenever the fancy strikes them. This bad habit has compounded itself by the American habit of dragging friends and associates into their crimes whenever they think that they can get away with it.\n\nBrazilian blood has been shed on South African soil, and for what? A proxy boxing match between America and Germany? To take sides in a civil war that does not concern us? Ships and ships of Brazil's youth and treasures have been sent east, to no return. No more. President Quadros will stand up to the political establishment and convince lawmakers to abandon this quixotic war. Surely, hidden within the legislature's stony heart, there remains some remnant of decency and patriotism?"

These titanical conglomerates run the entire German economy, from slave plantations to chemical industries to banking and financial services. Tapping into the german kleptocratic economy requires going through these cartels.\n\nWe will cultivate better relationships with these corporations, and entice them to invest their money into Brazil.

It will definitely not be the last.\n\nCompared to the hypocritical American democrats and the belligerent imperial pretensions of the Reich, the Japanese seem content to manage their recent acquisitions and tend to internal matters. Nevertheless, Tokyo's envoys continue to monitor the situation in latin America motivated by the Japanese hunger for new export markets. This situation can be used to our advantage.\n\nPresident Quadros shall invite the Japanese ambassador to a banquet. There, talks will begin in earnest about improving bilateral relationships.

Now they accuse President Quadros of digging holes under the fence so foxes and wolves can get in.\n\nThe northerners need not fear anything. Our independent foreign policy is not about ending our friendship to America. Rather it is about being more self-confident in our dealing with other nations, about giving the Brazilian people the ability to seek friends throughout the globe.\n\nSurely, the Americans will understand that we mean no harm.

Nevertheless, in these troubled times Brazil cannot afford to be squeamish. The kleptocrats running the nazi empire are desperate for any friendship beyond the enslaved nations of the unity pakt. By offering them a foothold in the Americas, we can acquire a great deal of the German's stolen wealth.\n\nThe independent foreign policy requires us to deal with the Devil."
BRA_end_restrictions_on_immigration: "End Restrictions on Japanese Immigration"
BRA_end_restrictions_on_immigration_desc: "Brazil, a land of immigrants, has seen unjust barriers erected to potential new citizens. Among those, a law putting a cap on the arrival of new Japanese families was introduced in the forties. Initially lured to replace the freed slave as disposable labor in coffee plantations, the soaring Brazilian-Japanese population rapidly alarmed the political elite. This racial bigotry towards non-whites, as well as distrust of Japanese as a potential fifth column for the axis, have contributed to the current sorry state of our immigration laws.\n\nThese laws must end. The Japanese population has been hard working, and unfairly attacked by their community. What's more, removing immigration restrictions will be well received in Tokyo. President Quadros will mend this historical injustice and end the immigration restrictions. Befitting our status as a tropical nation, this infusion of vigorous blood and talents will help the national renewal our party seeks to bring about. Even better, as children of the Confucian tradition, our new citizens will have a healthy respect of authority, and of their duties to the state."

American foreign policy experts will see that our government has in fact expanded American influence within Brazil. Being given a bigger slice of the pie, will the northerner still begrudge us for trying to expand the pie through the independent foreign policy?\n\nSome whisper that giving Americans more leverage in Brazil is a dangerous game to follow. Thankfully, we know better than hesitating like scared kittens. Let the Brazilian jaguar stride confidently!"
BRA_a_trip_to_tokyo: "A Trip to Tokyo"
BRA_a_trip_to_tokyo_desc: "Few Brazilian are more well traveled than our esteemable president. The year 1962 saw Mr. Quadros visit China, one of the jewels of the greater co-prosperity sphere. Now it is time for our President to return to Asia, not as a mere politician, but as the new leader of the Brazilian Republic. It is time to take Tokyo by storm!\n\nCritics implore President Quadros to stay in Brazil, and work on internal problems rather than put on a pageantry and make a fool of himself abroad. What do they know? Brazil's future is one of an international player, a nation courted by all and controlled by none but its citizens. Japanese investors will crowd into our great country once they learn that we are open for business!"
BRA_continue_cia_connections: "Continue CIA Ties"
BRA_continue_cia_connections_desc: "Our intelligence agencies have long had ties with Uncle Sam's enforcers. Beginning with the OSS during the war, and continuing with the boys in Langley, the Brazilian intelligence agencies such as the DOPS have long had cordial relationships with American ones. From helping to train agents, to collaborating on new surveillance techniques, to information sharing; without the CIA our modern spy agencies would struggle to keep the lights on.\n\nThis reliance on the CIA is a threat to our desire to follow an independent foreign policy. However, the American presence could also be an opportunity. We will continue previous arrangements made with Langley, even as we look to other great powers for help. The Americans will feel safer knowing that any attempt by the Japanese or Germans to meddle into Brazilian affairs can be monitored. And our intelligence agencies will be reassured by the continued collaboration with America."
BRA_a_formal_dinner: "A Formal Dinner"
BRA_a_formal_dinner_desc: "The German ambassador to Brazil has long been used to contemptuous silence. Post-war normalization of relationships has not been built upon, as Brazilians have shunned relationships with most nations of the Unity-Pakt.\n\nWe will break with precedent by being the first to talk to the German ambassador in nigh on two decades. Inviting the man to a dinner will no doubt cause an uproar within the capital. So be it; our cold treatment of Germany has not done anything to hinder their criminal empire. For better of ill, the Germans are now part of the balance of great powers. Lost in dark woods of an increasingly dark world, Brazil must seek its own path without fear."
BRA_the_starter_complete: "The Starter Complete"
BRA_the_starter_complete_desc: "It seems like such a short time since President Quadros has ascended to the presidency. So much has been begun, and so many wonderful projects meant to ensure Brazil's future have begun. The coming election, however, forces to put our work on hold. It is time to see if the Brazilian people will grant us a mandate to continue our campaign against corruption, as well as our struggle to steer the ship of state through turbulent geopolitical waters.\n\nWe are confident that the Brazilian people will choose the path of freedom, of order, of progress. We do not advocate revolution, the delusional chase of phantasmagorical demi-marxist truism advocated by Goulart or his ilk. Nor do we seek to maintain a stagnant, corrupt status quos of the PSD era. We stand for Brazil itself, for its people. If the lords wills it, our adversaries will be defeated at the ballot box!"
BRA_onto_the_main_course: "Onto the Main Course"
BRA_onto_the_main_course_desc: "Victory! A great victory for the common man, for the nation, and for President Quadros!\n\nSo much remains to be done. Once they mocked us as populist, as conservative demagogues. In Brazil as abroad they mocked President Quadros' eccentricity. Now the entire world is stunned at our great electoral victory. And within the Presidential Palace, the Independent Foreign Policy continues to be discussed, analyzed. Brazil has been unchained, and the entire world shall watch attentively for our next steps!"

 ## Military Coup
 BRA_the_intervention: "The Intervention"
 BRA_the_intervention_desc: "More than a decade ago already, we marched against the dictator Vargas who had done so much to undo this great nation. Today, we march again.\n\nCowards within the senate accuse of seeking the end of Brazilian democracy. These slanderous accusations merely seek to distract from the catastrophes the politicians have brought down onto the republic. The average soldier is not an enemy of the constitution, but its most ardent defender. In recent times, elected officials have preferred chasing bribes and graft to fighting fascists and communists. It would be criminal negligence for us to let the situation fester any longer.\n\nThe senate is to be closed. If democracy is to live in Brazil, we must act decisively to save the nation. Where the executive, legislative and judicial have all faltered, we shall succeed."
 BRA_lighting_ofensive: "Lightning Offensive"
 BRA_lighting_ofensive_desc: "Our intervention has shocked the nation. It is time to capitalize on the element of surprise to capture as many enemies of the Republic as possible while they are still out in the open.\n\nThe so-called constitutionalists have long formed the kernel of a wide coalition against a military intervention. Present within a wide array of political factions and institutions, these men and women will begin plotting against us as soon as they recover. Continuing our lightning offensive is thus critical to the success of our intervention.\n\nThe number one priority target is Henrique Lott. This despicable former general has long used his influence within the army to argue caution and patience with regard to the Kubitschek government. We once believed his lies. Now we know he merely schemed his ascent to the presidency. Lott is a perfidious traitor, and he must not be allowed a chance to rally our opposition."
 BRA_pass_first_institutional_act: "Pass the First Institutional Act"
 BRA_pass_first_institutional_act_desc: "With power seized and the army opposition silenced, it is time to deal with the rest of the country. We must of course ensure that we have the legal capability and authority to do this, thus we shall pass the first institutional act. A large law giving the military a wide range of emergency powers and capabilities to deal with the crisis that engulfs Brazil at this very moment in time.  We shall of course put this in front of the senate but their views are only advisory and only trusted politicians and friends will be allowed to enter and vote, lest any fillibusters try and delay this needed bill."
 BRA_arrest_dissidents: "Arrest Dissidents"
 BRA_arrest_dissidents_desc: "The capture of the constitutionalists has cut off the head of any popular movement against our intervention. However, treason often takes the shape of a hydra, and ambitious politicians are trying to orient themselves against our emergency regime. These brave fools no doubt believe that with the previous generation of politicians rendered irrelevant, any one brave enough to step into the limelight will receive great benefits to their career.\n\nWe've no time to be frustrated at these ungrateful, seditious wretches. We shall initiate a second wave of arrests. Anyone who has not yet been cowed will be tossed in jail while we tend to the nation's wounds."
 BRA_win_over_media: "Win Over the Media"
 BRA_win_over_media_desc: "Political power has long rested on the consent of the governed, and in this age of mass media the masses' approval is paramount. After all, it takes only an instant for the nation's passions to be turned astray.\n\nThe media will thus be powerful allies of our intervention... or extremely dangerous enemies. It is crucial that we convince newspaper companies and radio and tv stations to spread our message of renewal and hope. Each citizen convinced by words and deeds of the justness of our emergency government will prove invaluable in the struggle to come.\n\nMedia moguls and independent journalists alike will be convinced to work with us. Those who will not be convinced will at least be persuaded to avoid discussing politics for quite some time."
 BRA_break_up_strikes: "Break Up Strikes"
 BRA_break_up_strikes_desc: "In the streets, the self-appointed defenders of the common man agitate. Several unions have launched simultaneous strikes. In attempting to derail our economy, union leaders hope to bring our intervention to an end.\n\nGood, honest Brazilian workers have taken to the streets. On whose behalf? Parasitic union leaders. Almost all of them in cahoot with communist filth. Poor innocent men and women are sent to wave their banners, as clashes with the police bloody the streets of our nation. The strikes must end, if we're to be given the opportunity to hunt down the shadows behind these illegitimate protests."
 BRA_crush_students: "Crush Student Protests"
 BRA_crush_students_desc: "As the surprise at our intervention has waned, not all have been terrorized by the idea of our emergency government. Brazilian students have risen up against the military. Peaceful protests are already turning into riots as clashes with police and army escalate. In Rio, bandits have made use of Zhdanov cocktails to torch an army checkpoint. Fleeing soldiers were showered with bricks and other projectiles.\n\nThe daring and energy of youth has long been susceptible to the poison of radicalism. No doubt agitated by communist propaganda and cynical opponents within the disgraced political class, our own children are marching to stop us from saving their future. We must show no mercy, if we are to save the nation's democracy. The students will be turned back through any means necessary."
 BRA_totally_not_a_coup: "This Is Not a Coup!"
 BRA_totally_not_a_coup_desc: "As surprise at our intervention has faded, a degree of fear has begun spreading throughout the nation. Streets are emptying as families huddle in their homes, afraid of encountering soldiers in the streets.\n\nA shepherd's flock need not fear its sheepdogs. Nor should good and honest citizens fear men in uniforms in these difficult times. It is time for General Humberto Castelo Branco, one of the many shepherds of the republic, to appear on tv to reassure the population. It is important to dispel the accusation that the army has launched a coup, and that military men have acted out of naught but self interest and are intent on ending democracy.\n\nA speech, then. The general's words may not convince all, but his appearance will no doubt help dispel the accusations that the army is out of touch with the civilian population."
 BRA_storm_them_instead: "Storm Opposition Media Stations"
 BRA_storm_them_instead_desc: "As expected, there are those who will not be silenced. Throughout the country many radio stations have proven uncooperative, especially among left-wing media companies. Some are no doubt agitated by the laudable cause of freedom of speech. Many more are likely to be motivated by sympathy for communism to spread bile and discord throughout the nation.\n\nWe've no time to separate the wheat from the chaff. All radio stations refractory to good moral will be stormed by our men and taken off the air.\n\nAny second lost is another seed of hatred planted in an innocent's heart."
 BRA_hunt_down_communist: "Hunt Down Communists"
 BRA_hunt_down_communist_desc: "As our youth and our working age brothers and sisters launch their misguided battles in the streets, the sinister force fraying the very fabric of society still lurks in the shadows. The communist snake whispers seductively of a better world, even as their poison sinks deeper and deeper within our country. Order turns to chaos as citizens are turned against one another. Progress turns to stagnation, as cynics and nihilists see a breakdown of the system favorably. What better way, after all, to convince the workers of capitalism's dysfunction than to engineer its demise?\n\nSuccessive governments have alternatively ignored or cajoled the communists. Our intervention will end once the last of these anarchists have been thrown in jail. The lucky ones, at least."
 BRA_move_into_country: "Move Into the Country"
 BRA_move_into_country_desc: "The Brazilian archipelago has seen all of its major islands captured by our forces. Rio, São Paulo and Brasília are now all orderly.\n\nHowever in the vast countryside between the cities, sharks and pirates still roam. It is time for the next part of our intervention. By moving into the countryside, we can pre-empt any attempt by the communists' peasant leagues to stir up trouble in peaceful and productive farmlands. The advance in the countryside will be equally useful in chasing any threat that has fled the big cities into the interior.\n\nMen, set sail! Fear not stormy waters, for fortune favors the bold!"
 BRA_censorship_laws: "Enact Media Censorship Laws"
 BRA_censorship_laws_desc: "Half of the battle for sanitization of the media comes from controlling the sources of it. The other half is to put in place the proper filters. News organizations need our guidance for time being, as our emergency government sets the nation right. Access to the undistilled truth requires solid institutions. Brazil has unfortunately seen the pillars of its constitutions hollowed out in the past decade.\n\nPassing censorship laws will be an important step in controlling the tone and content of the information that reaches citizens. Just as our intervention is set to eradicate evil from Brazilian politics, our partners in the media shall ease the fear of the public through a diet of truths judged appropriate for mass dispersal."
 BRA_win_over_companies: "Win Over Companies"
 BRA_win_over_companies_desc: "One group has thus far stayed mercifully silent during these early stages of our campaign to protect the constitution. The business community has mostly vacillated between silent fear of chaos and hope that the situation will now improve.\n\nWe will prove to businessmen that Brazil remains open for business. Our campaign to eradicate communism will do much good to assuage their fears. Already several unions have begun unofficial talks with industrial partners and with our government to build a joint front against the socialist menace. Once anarchist trouble-makers are rid of, our nation's greatest industrialists will no doubt provide financial and political backing to our intervention."
 BRA_talk_with_cia: "Talk With the CIA"
 BRA_talk_with_cia_desc: "Uncle Sam has long considered South America its backyard. Our restoration of order has roused the interest of the watchdogs in Langley. The Americans are never happy to be left out of the loop. However, our contacts have proven surprisingly patient with us so far. The standing order from back home seems to be for CIA agents to monitor the situation and seek an understanding with the new government.\n\nIt's imperative that we make use of the opportunity to explain ourselves. By showing enough deference to America and reassuring our contacts of our friendly intention, we can enlist the CIA's help in securing Brazil from communist, fascist or foreign interlopers."
 BRA_the_storm_subsides: "The Storm Subsides"
 BRA_the_storm_subsides_desc: "The past few months have seen the army triumph against all forces arrayed against it. Mass media profiting from the situation; brash student activists; deceitful union bosses; corrupt politicians dismayed at their loss of control; all stood against us. Thankfully, their failure to unite against us has allowed our men to crush them. For the good of the nation. For Brazil.\n\nNow that the storm has subsided, men within and without the army await for the next development. Cowed citizens in the streets await for the other shoe to drop. Electrified soldiers in the barracks look to us for their next orders.\n\nIt is time for us to determine if the time has come to call for new elections. "
 BRA_schedule_new_elections: "Schedule New Elections"
 BRA_schedule_new_elections_desc: " There are those who scoffed at our claims of restoring democracy to Brazil after the end of our intervention. Let them laugh no more, for our time at the head of the country has come to an end. The Sorbonne faction has reminded the officer corp of their oath to the constitution, and to respecting the popular mandate.\n\nNew elections are to occur then. Blessedly, they occur in a country cleansed from communism and fascism. Few political organizations have emerged unscathed from our war on corruption and treason. Carlos Lacerda's UDN party has thankfully been among the survivors. The men of the armed force have long found Lacerda's struggle against the decadent Brazilian political class admirable, and hope to see him do well at the ballot box."
 BRA_sorbonne_high_tt: "§QSorbonne§! is the §Ydominant faction§!"
 BRA_pass_second_institutional_act: "Pass the Second Institutional Act"
 BRA_pass_second_institutional_act_desc: "We began our intervention filled with hope for Brazil's future. That hope has now been tempered with a grim realization of the depths to which Brazil sunk. Seeing the people be so easily turned against our armed forces by corrupt political organizations and perfidious communist has done much to reinforce the hardliner faction.\n\nThe troubles began when we entrusted the nation to a new generation of politicians. This generation has failed the test. There shall be no reprieve, no new opportunity for kleptocrats and socialist sympathisers to return to power.\n\nThe army shall lead Brazil to its bright future. And this time, the people will not be misled about whom to follow."
