 INS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Indonesia, with Japanese help, threw off the Dutch during The Second World War. Though the feeling of victory against a long disdained foe was sweet, Indonesia was beset by insurgents of all stripes jockeying for control of the nation. Once again Japan would come to the rescue, lending their aid and guidance to the fledgling republic and it's leader; Sukarno. Independence finally declared in 1950, Indonesia has seen a torrent of governments all come and go. The sole constant has always been the steady hand of President Sukarno and his Five Principles, marking a decade of peace and prosperity. In spite of all that has been gained there remains a distant, ever present, roll of thunder that is only coming nearer."

 POLITICS_SUKARNO_DESC:0 "인도네시아의 영웅 수카르노는 인도네시아의 역사에서 그 어떤 인물과도 비교가 안됩니다. 서양의 제국주의에 의해 정복된 많은 아시아의 나라들 처럼, 인도네시아는 통일된 하나의 국가가 아니라 많은 왕국들과 부족들이 언어, 종교, 영토가 나눠진채로 서로 싸우고 있었습니다. 그러나 수카르노는 그 사단들을 좆도 아니게 바라보았고 인도네시아는 하나의 중요한 정신으로 통일된 국가가 되었습니다. 일본이 범아시아주의와 서구 열강으로부터의 해방이라는 환상을 가지고 왔을때 수카르노는 네덜란드로부터 그의 나라와 그의 국민들을 해방시킬수 있는 이전의 실패들과는 다른 기회를 보았습니다, 그리고 그는 좆같게도 멀리서 온 새로운 일본인들이 감시하는 자유 인도네시아 정부의 주역이되었습니다.\n\n수카르노는 인도네시아 국민들에게 사랑받는 인물입니다. 아무리 급진적인 이슬람교도나 반란군들도 그가 하는 행동이 잘못되었다는것 뿐, 수카르노가 이끄는 사람들에겐 신경쓰지 않겠다고 주장합니다. 수카르노 정권은 수십 년 동안 공영권에 충성해 왔지만, 인도네시아의 독립과 자유에 대한 그의 강력한 믿음은 일본에서는 더욱 의심스러워 해 문제가 되는중입니다, 그리고 수카르노는 공영권이 인도네시아에 봉사한다고 믿는 한 공영권을 믿을 것이 분명합니다. 그러나 아무리 그를 지지하는 세력이 많아도 독재자는 항상 저항세력이 있기 마련입니다.  수카르노의 혜안에도 불구하고 인도네시아는 여전히 매우 다양하며 수카르노조차 인도네시아를 하나로 뭉칠수 있을지 의심하는 사람들도 많습니다. 그래서 수카르노가 할일은 그들이 틀렸음을 증명하는 것입니다."

 ##Military Leader Descs##
 #########################
 FIELD_MARSHAL_SUHARTO:0 "Commander Suharto of the Indonesian Army is the second most powerful and third most influential man in the entire country. Quickly rising through the ranks during the National Revolution, Suharto became an integral part of the military and constructed a minor powerbase around himself. Filled with ambition, he makes every attempt to advise President Sukarno, much to the chagrin of Vice President Hatta, who opposes him at every turn. Where exactly Suharto's ambition will take him is anyone's guess, but everyone expects, or fears, that he will do whatever it takes to get there."
 FIELD_MARSHAL_ABDUL_HARIS_NASUTION:0 "Commander Abdul Haris Nasution is feared for his brutality among the rebel forces of Indonesia and even his own troops, and rightfully so. The terror he inflicts is that of a man who has a greater purpose for which he can do no wrong in service of. Everything he does is for Indonesia. Every village set aflame. Every rebel executed. Every order issued. All of it for Indonesia."
 GENERAL_LB_MOERDANI:0 "General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani's military career was jump-started by his service in a Student Army during the National Revolution. He rose to prominence and fame, though not necessarily the good kind, due to his strong, outspoken political stances and religion. Being a Catholic in a majority Muslim country, he is the subject of a great deal of suspicion, though his loyalty to Indonesia and Sukarno has never been openly called into question."

 INS_Shinkyoutei:0 "신협정"
 INS_Shinkyoutei_desc:0 "일본이 인도네시아의 해방을 원조했을때, 그들은 천연자원에 대한 굶주림을 나타냈습니다. 이러한 긴급한 자원의 필요에 따라 일본은 인도네시아를 위한 "신협정" 혹은 '뉴딜'을 결성했습니다; 국가의 현대화를 위한 원조의 대가로 인도네시아 정부와 일본 재벌 사이에 새로운 공통의 목적을 위한 협회가 창립되었고 일본의 자이바츠들은 그들의 그룹화에 SKN라는 이름을 채택하였습니다. 많은 시간이 지나 우리의 산업화에 대한 일본의 지원이 바싹 말라버렸고고 자이바츠들은 우리의 광물로부터의 부에 대한 큰 몫과 그들의 판매 수익에 대한 통제권을 계속 유지하고 있습니다."

 INS_Romusha:0 "노무자 체계"
 INS_Romusha_desc:0 "인도네시아 독립전쟁때 처음 소개된 노무자 체계는 인도네시아 사회의 많은 악질적인 요소들입니다. 일본인들이 필요로하고 수카르노에게 이익이되는 이 체계는 인도네시아와 공영권 전역에서 육체 노동을 위해 인구의 일부를 보내는 것을 말합니다. 인도네시아의 노동자들 열약한 환경과 한계가 있는 봉급에 직면해있고, 일본인들을 위해 일하기 위해 해외로 보내진 운이 없는 사람들은 몸과 마음이 부셔져서 조국으로 돌아옵니다."
 INS_Army_plan_65_modifier:0 "국방 계획 1965
 INS_Army_plan_65_modifier_desc:0 "인도네시아 육군은 전군에서 가장 강렬한 군대입니다. 지상군에 대한 우리의 헌신은 인도네시아에서 인도네시아에서 감히 우릴 공격하는 반군이나 외국 세력과 경쟁 할 수 있는 힘을 만들었습니다."
 INS_idea_Honor_Above_All_Else:0 "다른 무엇보다 명예"
 INS_idea_Honor_Above_All_Else_desc:0 "인도네시아의 육군은 우리나라의 이상을 보여주는 나라의 빛나는 모범입니다. 또한 군 참모 회의와 막사에서 힘과 명예 및 충성심이 울려 퍼집니다. 육군은 싸우고 죽을것이며 우리들의 적으로부터 승리를 거두기 위해 모든것을 바칠것입니다. 조국 인도네시아를 위협하는 자들에겐 파멸이 있으리! 수카르노 각하를 위협하는 자들에게도 파멸이 있으리!"
 INS_purge:0 "관료들을 숙청하다"
 INS_purge:0 "수카르노 대통령은 정부에서 역겨운 독사들과 쥐들을 모두 숙청하는데 성공했습니다. 각하께선 위대한 국가 기관의 모든 복도, 모든 사무실 및 모든 정신을 지배한 어두운 찌꺼기들을 숙청하셨습니다. 더이상 반역자들과 반체제 인사들이 우리의 위대한 인도네시아를 약화시키고 부패해 썩지 않을것입니다. 이제 모든 관리들은 인도네시아에 대한 충성심이 곧 수카르노에 대한 충성임을 아는 애국자들입니다."

 INS_purge1:0 "수카르노 대통령은 정부에서 역겨운 독사들과 쥐들을 모두 숙청하는데 성공했습니다. 각하께선 위대한 국가 기관의 모든 복도, 모든 사무실 및 모든 정신을 지배한 어두운 찌꺼기들을 숙청하셨습니다. 더이상 반역자들과 반체제 인사들이 우리의 위대한 인도네시아를 약화시키고 부패해 썩지 않을것입니다. 이제 모든 관리들은 인도네시아에 대한 충성심이 곧 수카르노에 대한 충성임을 아는 애국자들입니다."
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Enhanced:0 "강화된 신협정"
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Enhanced_desc:0 "경제전쟁 동안 SKN들은 그 어느 때보다 우리의 산업을 더 많이 조종하였습니다. 여전히 인도네시아의 대부분의 대기업들은 전부 일본의 소유입니다. 그들은 우리 주권 국가 내에서 많은 영향력을 가지고 있습니다. 이 협정이 국민의 장기적 이익을 위한것인지의 여부는 확실하지 않습니다, 그러나 지금 인도네시아의 부는 우리나라에서 일본의 독점자들과 그 회사들의 틈새로 흘려지고 있습니다."
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Shattered:0 "신협정이 산산조각이 나다"
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Shattered_desc:0 "지옥같았던 경제전쟁이 끝나고 SKN은 사실상 파괴되었습니다. 지금 당장은 일본 소유의 회사들은 인도네시아의 것이 되거나 자기들의 국가로 도망쳤습니다. 이것이 국민들의 장기적인 이익에 해당하는지는 확실하지 않지만, 인도네시아의 주요 산업들은 다시 한번 조국 인도네시아인들의 것이 되었다는건 확신할수 있습니다."
 INS_Romusha_Enhanced:0 "노무사가 단단히 자리잡다."
 INS_Romusha_Enhanced_desc:0 "인도네시아의 암덩어리같던 노무사는 우리 사회에 확고히 뿌리를 내렸습니다.. 노동자들은 매우 힘들고 허리가 깨지는 노동을 하러 매일 강제징집됩니다. 그 노동은 사망률이 높지만 실업률은 낮습니다. 그들 덕분에 인도네시아 국민들은 벼랑 끝까지 몰렸습니다. 기업과 회사는 그들의 대규모 프로젝트를 위해 일상적으로 이 시스템을 사용하여 많은 희생을 치르고 그들 소수를 풍요롭게 합니다.\n\n인도네시아를 위하여 모든 이를.\n\n인도네시를 위해 모든 것을."
 INS_Pertamina:0 "쁘르따미나"
 INS_Pertamina_desc:0 "쁘르따미나는 인도네시아 전역에서 대부분의 석유 추출 작업을 담당하고 국가 전체의 경제 안정을 책임지고 있는 국영 석유 회사입니다."
 FRI_100_day_campaign:0 "100일 전"
 FRI_100_day_campaign_desc:0 "수카르노 대통령은 누구보다 우월한 전략과 무장 그리고 의지를 통해 반역자들이 패배하고 내전이 100일 안에 끝날 것이라고 약속하였습니다. 이것은 육군에 활력을 불어넣어 끔찍하고 피비린내 나는 정글 전쟁을 이겨낼 힘을 주었습니다. 수카르노가 그 약속을 이행할 수 있을지는 내부에 논쟁의 여지가 있습니다. 전쟁이 100일 이상 질질 끌리면 우리에게 돌아오는 결과는 끔찍할 수 있습니다.. "
 FRI_disruption:0 "반군이 방해하다"
 FRI_disruption_desc:0 "자유 인도네시아의 군대는 빨치산들과 게릴라 준술을 이용해 우리 병사들을 괴롭히고 분열하게 만드는 반란 작전을 시작하였습니다. 그들이 민간인들을 공격에 사용하는건 놀라운 일은 아니지만 여전히 우리의 병사들은 사기가 깎이고 있습니다. 하타는 시민들 사이에서 많은 지지를 받고 있으며, 그가 살아있는 동안 반군을 뿌리뽑는것은 어려울 것입니다."

 FRI_scaled_back_rations:0 "배급을 축소하다"
 FRI_scaled_back_rations_desc:0 "배급을 줄이기로 한 결정은 인기가 없습니다. 생산량 증가로 이어졌지만 민간인들은 전쟁과 공복에 대한 수카르노의 약속에 빠르게 환멸을 느끼고 있습니다. 분명히 전쟁이 끝난다면 배급도 같이 끝날것이지만 사람들의 갈등들을 뽑아내진 못할것입니다."
 FRI_more_rations:0 "배급을 늘리다."
 FRI_more_rations_desc:0 "우리가 배급량을 늘리기로 한 결정은 믿을 수 없을 정도로 인기를 받았습니다. 그러나 그게 생산량 감소로 이어진 반면에 민간인들은 전쟁의 노력과 수카르노 대통령에 대해 점점 더 지지하게 되었습니다! 잘 먹는 한, 전쟁과 고통 그리고 죽음을 잊을것입니다."
 FRI_security_of_capture:0 "안보의 지배권을 쥐다"
 FRI_security_of_capture_desc:0 "수카르노 대통령과 인도네시아 육군은 패배를 두려워하거나 후퇴를 고려할 필요가 없습니다. 인도네시아의 용감한 애국자들은 반역자들이 한 치의 땅이라도 얻기 전에 힘과 돌 뒤에 천년 동안 서 있을 것입니다. 인도네시아에 영광을! 수카르노에게 영광을!!"

What he always does. He builds. He started by building the nation himself, a daunting task for one man alone. It was then he may have lost his way, becoming more complacent with the corruption plaguing the army.\n\nAs the papers would tell you, that's far from the truth.

Tokyo's Economic Minister has informed us of some troubling developments in the sunrise kingdom, pertaining to an economic war of sorts unfurling in Japan, as rival factions of industrial elites compete for political and commercial influence. Any economic unrest inflicting such a powerful trading partner of ours is such to have negative consequences for Indonesia--but, perhaps there's a silver lining for us to find somewhere?\n\nThe Shinkyoutei, that Japanese conglomerate that manages the extraction and export of our national resources to Japan, is being left spiritless and languid by the competition between its Japanese corporate backers. Their paralysis affords us an opportunity to make this conflict work in our favour."
INS_Not_Just_Ours:0 "우리뿐만 아니라"
INS_Not_Just_Ours_desc:0 "It would be foolish of us to take too aggressive an action against the financial cliques of Japan, no matter the will for it by some in our government. Ours is an international, Pan-Asian economy, closely interlinked with those of our partners in Japan and the rest of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. It would be needlessly disruptive to our country, not to mention politically risky, to try and seize their wealth for ourselves.\n\nInstead of taking advantage of the infighting among the Japanese businessmen to stab them in the back, it would be wiser of us to try and work with them, and to look at this as an opportunity to push through reform. Some of the Shinkyoutei's leaders have expressed mild interest in the past in slightly moderating their behaviour, and it seems possible (if not effortless) for us to guide these entities' back into the direction of Indonesia's own economic self-interest, instead of just Japan's. Why compete when we can cooperate?"

With their corporate overlords focused on pressing concerns at home in Japan, it will be up to the underlings of the Zaibatsus, those men running the day-to-day operations of Shinkyoutei, to hear our calls for reform. Without the industrialist titans of enterprise in Tokyo there with them, they'll hopefully be less reticent to make the changes we need. More important than any specific alteration to revenues paid to the government or wages paid to workers is the organization of the SKN itself. For too long, investors from Japan have had an iron grip over the conglomerate's activities. If we are to make the SKN serve Indonesia, it must first abandon its current masters."

Our wealth shall be ours alone.\n\nOf course, we still will have to be clever about it. Overtly hostile action against the staffers of the Shinkyoutei may be both justified and popular, but it is also politically infeasible; we can't allow the fate of the SKN to spiral into an international incident.

One strategy, useful both as a symbolic propaganda tool to legitimize the breakup of SKN as well as because of its reasonable judicial grounding, is to try the worst of them for corruption. Whilst it maintained a monopoly on resource extraction in Indonesia, the businessmen in charge of SKN dealt in all kinds of illegal activities, embezzlement and bribery only some among them.

It is the federal government's duty, after all, to keep such an important institution of the national economy under close watch.\n\nFurthermore, in respect of the great threat to Indonesian national security that an attack against the SKN's treasury building would represent to the country's economy, the SKN's board--under close personal protection by federal authorities--has voted unanimously in favour of a plan to merge the treasury of the SKN into the Indonesian national treasury in Jakarta. This will help physically protect the enterprise's assets from the threats the company has had levied against it on a daily basis by extremist groups since the outbreak of the Economic Wars."

From Aceh to Papua, electrical plants and power lines are being built at a rapid pace, developed in collaboration between the federal government and SKN. In light of Shinkyoutei's selfless, patriotic devotion to the welfare of the Indonesian people and the economic development of the country, the Indonesian people may yet come around to considering the company a legitimate national institution.

What they had been promised when the Japanese arrived was far from the case, it turned out that they were nothing but another pawn in Japan's game. Sukarno had tired very much of games, the people of Indonesia had thrown off all the shackles that had once bound them, it was high time that a worker could go to his job to advance in society, not just writhe under the corporate boot.\n\nWith the reogrganization of the Shinkyoutei, more wealth can go straight to the reserves of the goverment and from there back to the hands of the people.

How could he say that? In his mind, Hatta instinctively knows that the next round of purges would devastate the already-fragile nation. To exert its power abroad, Djakarta depended on local, charismatic leaders such as Daud Bereu'eh in Atjeh, B.W. Lapian in Soelawesi and Johannes Latuharhary in Maluku - ostensibly loyal nationalists and allies of the Central Government, but are unbeknownst to them - at least openly, are being marked down for purges by Sukarno's ever-centralising administration.\n\nBut, the Vice-President relents - any further misstep, and he's on Sukarno's chopping block.

He then glances at the alternative plan of his own making: a lighter purge that will only target regions which are deemed to be extraordinary threats to national security, such as the wily Daud Bereu'eh in Atjeh.

President Sukarno answered plainly. He was seated at his desk, but seemed to tower over Hatta. "You are always advocating for more democracy; Now I offer a referendum and all you do is complain."\n\nHatta seethed under his cool composure. "I want elections for leaders, presidents - not dictators." he said, unsheathing each word from his mouth like a blade. "If you give yourself even more power you will undermine everything we've worked for."\n\nSukarno suddenly stood up, placed his hands on the desk, and leaned towards Hatta till their faces were just inches apart. "On the contrary: I will secure everything we have worked for." Hatta flinched back and Sukarno, satisfied by the reaction, picked his hands up and turned away.\n\nHe gazed out his office window and absentmindedly addressed Hatta once more. "Democracy has failed Indonesia. I will not."\n\nWhen he turned around to hear his retort, Hatta had already left."

Laughter and cheers followed him like the thousands of grey shadows cast by infinite orange lights. The finest suit covered his body. The strongest drink rested in his hand. The most beautiful woman clung to his arm.\n\n"Friends!" he began, already drawing applause. "I want to thank you all for attending this party!" The applause continued, amplifying the President's voice rather than smothering it. "But I also want to thank you for your support." Sukarno pivoted, transforming his tone from one of joviality to rugged seriousness.\n\n"He's telling it like it is." went the unsaid affirmation among the crowd.\n\n"Without your support," he continued. "Indonesia would not be the country it is today, nor will it be the country it deserves to be tomorrow."\n\nA gentle warmth filled the audience. "We make Indonesia better." they beamed. Their light hearts were brighter than all the orange electric bulbs.\n\n"So I implore you," President Sukarno concluded. "Support me in the coming referendum and you will see, with your own eyes, the great future that lies before us!"\n\nThe enraptured raised their glasses, golden in the light, and toasted the President and his grand future."

According to the most recent statistics, more than 75 percent of the nation has thrown their weight behind Bung Karno, it seems the will of the president will march on, unimpeded. While here on Java, the average man can hardly contain their excitement... " The merry woman continued on, although Hatta could hardly make out a word said as the room erupted into thunderous applause. Men shot up from their seats, slapping their hands against the backs of their compatriots in celebration. Amongst it all, Sukarno sat, obviously more than content with the results judging by the grin that extended from ear to ear.\n\nHatta felt his stomach wage war with itself. The Vice President gently bit his lip in consideration, had this not been what he wanted? Unmistakably, the president meant well, he was doing what was best for the nation. Hatta was more than confident that Sukarno, Bung, his friend, was an earnest man who's vision for the nation became a rallying point for all, coalescing into one simple phrase, NASAKOM. Despite this, the victory lodged itself in the aging visionaries' throat, depriving him of oxygen, preventing him from speaking out. Hatta was considerably conscious of the situation, he had borne witness to many of the meetings in preparation for the referendum. Restricting access to polls, armed guards in the polling stations, it wasn't right. It was far from democracy.\n\nAbruptly, Hatta found himself pulled back to reality when he felt a rough jostle against his shoulder. Hatta looked up, the grinning face of the President occupying his field of vision.\n\n"Where is your excitement Hatta? We won!"\n\nHatta's lips remained a straight line, "It isn't right, Bung.

For as much as he enjoyed it all; the lucrative drinks, the foreign women, the parties stretching into the early hours of the morning, Sukarno was still the president. No, he was greater than that, he was Indonesia. He was the spirit of a freshly united people taken manifest to defend the archipelago from outside invaders. He swiveled the leather chair to his desk, even spirits must do work. He flipped through the ocean of papers on his desk.\n\n"Junk. Junk. Hm, keep." Sukarno organized the letters on his desk, Hatta usually was the one to process the mail into important and not. Where was Hatta? He hadn't been at the morning briefing. Sukarno shrugged it off, he was probably just... what was that? Sukarno's attention was drawn away to a letter, it's message clear from the red ink on the front. "To Sukarno, my good friend." Confused, Sukarno quickly tore open the envelope.\n\nThe message inside was quick and concise, "Bung, I fear you have wandered too deep into the forest of power and have lost your way. I've made my intentions clear from the beginning, an Indonesia to challenge the petty monarchs and to stand far above the warlords of China. I've stood for one thing, Bung, since day one, a free Indonesia. From when I took up arms against the colonists, to the battles in your office, I attempted to make peace, to work with you, because you are my friend, Sukarno, but I can no longer be blinded by friendship. I cannot take part in this government any longer. Effective immediately, I will no longer be fulfilling the roles of my office."

Sukarno sized the man up and down, before him stood a general, a popular one at that, but Nasution was more than a general, he was an idea, similar to Sukarno. One man was the spirit of a nation, the other the body. For all of Sukarno's admirers, there were just as many who would be pleased to see him hang, Nasution kept them in check. For all intents and purposes, the army had occupied the office of the president. Sukarno stood up, his knuckles resting on the desk, "Your actions are solely at the whim of this office!" Sukarno gripped a pen in his hand and jabbed it into the chest of Nasution, "You see this? I'll tell you who to kill, when to do it and how! I'll tell you to deliver me the traitor and you will!

During the war, someone once told him that the eyes are the windows to the soul. Sukarno could not risk his subordinates knowing he had a soul. Sukarno was the soul, he could not let his conscious weigh on every decision made, where would he be? Sukarno relied on impulse above all else, another drink couldn't hurt, this man would have to die, it was appropriate to smoke during a visit from other heads of state, whatever it may be, Sukarno knew he was right in doing so or could talk himself into believing it. As the clique of generals chattered before him, Sukarno felt a hole open in his stomach. It was unknown feeling to the man, regret.\n\n"We ambushed his motorcade once he had left the city limits, we didn't want to risk a spectacle. However," General Moerdani tugged at his collar, "The boys...well they're boys, Bung. What could've been played off as a mere traffic stop quickly escalated. It's about glory to them, but above all else, it's about service to the nation, and in executing your will...they may have gotten out of hand." Sukarno's face tensed up as he listened. What could they possibly do wrong? Hatta was nothing more than a pouting child! Bring him home, iron out the differences, and return to business as usual. "We shouldn't have brought military equipment, it was a mistake." The general continued, "It only took one man hoping to earn the admiration of his nation and a grenade to spiral the situation out of control. The vehicle was destroyed and the bodies rendered unrecognizable but we're confident we've succeeded."\n\nSukarno tore off his sunglasses, opening the blinds, but revealing a dirty window. Sukarno's eyes did not depict the sadness inside of him, rather unbroiled rage. "Idiots! A simple command, arrest a man, not even, all I had requested was for you to escort him back! Now he is...Hatta is dead. Get out. All of you out of this room at once."

He had no intention of letting that idealistic bastard cower back in the good graces of Sukarno but now wasn't the time for power moves, not when Sukarno was on edge.\n\nWhen the pack of POLRI armored vehicles finally arrived, the city had taken note of their arrival, as was intended. Hatta made no effort to hide his location, operating straight out of childhood home, why would they? Suharto hopped off his bike, leaving it leaning against the fence. The police attached their gear and prepared the assault but Suharto moved little. His job was to hold the radio and tell Sukarno how he had been the one to execute the will of the president. He casually retrieved a cigar from the deep pockets of his shirt, watching as the burly men approached the door, brought the battering ram to its knob, and demolished the entrance to Hatta's home turned headquarters.\n\nSuharto waited and waited. He took a drag and waited. He stared at the birds flying overhead, undisturbed, and waited. Surely there was to be some commotion? A struggle? Hatta's firebrand idealism surely would not permit him to come peacefully? Suharto's anxiety built as more time passed and no sound came from the house. Suharto was relieved to finally hear the boots on the stairs. Down came one of the officers, his hat in his hands. "We turned the whole place upsidedown, sir. The tea was warm, he just slipped out of our reach."\n\nSuharto felt his body tense, how had they failed? Suharto picked up the radio, he wasn't about to give Sukarno a reason to have him shot."

Sukarno had insisted, or rather demanded, the PA system had been tuned to the frequency 93.5, the station of the rebellion. Hatta's abrupt betrayal had obviously affected the president. The lavish parties spilling over with women and booze, those were not his friends. The Japanese businessmen he rubbed shoulders with? All superficial. All it took was one person to be ripped from him to change his entire perception of life.\n\n"To all those yearning for a free Indonesia." The simple phrase ripped Sukarno away from his thoughts. Hatta's voice, as much as Sukarno was relieved to hear, alarmed him. His message did not seem like the friendly reconciliation he expected. "I speak as someone who has seen the inner workings of the Sukarno government, a government that rose to power by using the people as stepping stones. Has Sukarno lifted you up? Have you enjoyed the amenities of the rest of the world? No, every rupiah made is funneled back to the state, to the pocket of Sukarno. While you live in disease-infested shacks, he dines with the very men who pillaged this country two decades back! Sukarno would have you believe that there exists only two options, the continuation of his regime, or the destruction of Indonesia as we know it. My friends, Indonesia as we know it deserves to die. This is not the nation promised to you nor the one you deserve. I present an alternative, an opportunity to tear this nation down from the foundation and build a new one from its ashes. A free republic that is the envy of Asia, not the stain."\n\nAs quickly as he appeared, Hatta was gone. Sukarno was left with static once again. He stared into the radio, hoping to find the face of Hatta, his friend. Only static. If Hatta had harboured these feelings from the beginning, perhaps Suharto was not scheming, maybe Hatta was the enemy. Sukarno refused to touch the dial, the static continuing to reverberate out of the speakers, but it could not drown out the president's thoughts."

In reality, Pancasila was nothing more than wasted breath. Sukarno would fulfill none of his obligations, it was his folly. For all Sukanro believed in, the execution of his ideas left much to be desired. That's what would set them apart; the execution.\n\n"Oppressed people of Indonesia! Your presence here means something monumental, today we show that Sukarno and the Jakarta clique do not hold full control over the people! You have come here for one simple reason, to see change brought to Indonesia. You may be surprised to learn that standing shoulder to shoulder with you, the left and the right are in attendance today. I point this out for a simple reason, you did not even notice. The factionalism that Sukarno decries is what he preaches to the people as well. What Indonesia needs is a democracy that responds to the will of the people solely, which means hearing all sides, not just Masyumi and Ulama. It is because so many have been shut out of the current government that myself and our allies from across the spectrum have come together to form a new one, one prepared to bring Indonesia on par with the modern world, not leaving us in the dust with the authoritarian stereotype of Asia!"\n\nHatta grinned as he crowd erupted into applause, but he felt the same pit open up in his stomach, there really was no turning back now, Waving to the people, Hatta saw Indonesia for what it really was, not a man, not a general, not a president, but a collection of different people coming together to live in harmony.

How he yearned to be back in Palembang, to be back in the good graces of the people, but Sukarno wasn't in Palembang, he was vacantly staring at the mayor of Jakarta.\n\nSukarno watched from his chair as the mayor rattled off the typical script, how the prosperity of the city stemmed from the drive to put Indonesia on the map, questioning where would be if it weren't for the principles enshrined in the Charter of Jakarta. Something caught his attention, something unapproved said by the mayor, "What we owe little to is the Sukarno government," The unfinished statement drew a collective gasp from the crowd and reanimated the apathetic Sukarno. "A government of mismanagement and waste, one of repression and subversion!" The crowd turned their puzzled gaze to Sukarno.\n\nNo. This was not going to slide, not at a time like this. Sukarno casually stood up and sauntered to the trembling official, placing a hand on his back. "There we have it! It seems to me that the opposition is getting weaker with their slander!"

He dreaded staying late in the Merdeka Palace so it was best to get his daily tasks done early. He checked his watch, it had to have been at least three. It was only noon. Sukarno sighed and stood from his chair, he needed a break. He walked to the window, a change of scenery would help him. The scenery before him did anything but.\n\nThere were at least two thousand he'd say, their signs hoisted high into the air. "Down with the Ramah tyrant!" read one of them. Sukarno scoffed to himself, finding humor in a situation that would leave many leaders trembling, that was the reputation he had built? A friendly tyrant? What was so wrong with that? The crowd festered in the lawn, shouting chants for resignation, singing songs from the war of independence, and parading around in circles. He clenched his fists as the guards did nothing but standby as the demonstrators' numbers swelled. Sukarno, for all of his rash decisions and brazen actions, was still a man of history, he had seen this song and dance too many times to allow this to continue. Sukarno marched over to his desk and picked up the phone. The buck stops here.\n\n"Suharto? Get off your ass and get outside, I want you to keep a close eye on these people, no funny business."

He was fighting for these people, why did they feel the need to push back?

Those who stand for freedom, rise now!" In a calculated move, many pushed back their seats and rose to their feet, prompting a raise of the eyebrow from Sukarno. It was more than he expected, but far from career-ending. It almost made him laugh, the opposition was not the political powerhouse it acted like it was. All theatrics from politicians, it only reaffirmed Sukarno's beliefs. He cast his gaze towards a few of the more concerning representatives, ones who may be easily swayed, and found most standing. He gritted his teeth, the coalition must hold, he needed the power from the assembly to continue his campaign against Hatta.\n\n"Do you see that, Mr. President? Your actions have forced even the most bitter enemies to unite, when will you come back to the negotiating table?

This did little to hinder his movement, the people only needed to look outside the window to see how far Sukarno got them. This was an unusual occasion however, Bung was acting erratic, making choices he would never dream of doing. It was no question where the mayor went, it was not up in the air whether or not it was democratic to break up the protest, the people were not blind.

Yet, the iron was hot and there was no better time to strike. Hatta opened his mouth and spoke into the microphone, his message being broadcasted at a protest numbering in the tens of thousands. Hatta, safe from his room, spoke passionately of the future to come, for what Indonesia could be made into, and what would be left behind. His voice strained from the speeches but more was caught in his throat, it was doubt. The crowds Sukarno pulled would humble president or prime minister the world around. Hatta shook the negativity from his mind, it only meant he needed to work harder, nothing worth fighting for was easy.\n\nWhile Hatta accepted the necessity of conflict, those in the streets of Jakarta who stood face to face with the police felt their own doubts. They wanted something better but was this the best way to achieve it? As men shouted to stand down, one boy, bearly twenty, had decided that it was the only way.

He spun a tale of a freshly united nation doomed to fall back into the same unorganized squabbling tribes and kingdoms that had made them easy pickings for the imperialists. He bled the story of Indonesia, out of every pore of his body not only oozed unrivaled nationalism, but the acute observer could pick up on the desperation in his voice.\n\nAs Sukarno, as Indonesia, deflated before the representatives, having no more left to give, he mustered all that was left in him to one last cry, demanding the approval of the act before them. Sukarno's laboured breathing was the only sound in the assembly. In the quiet, Sukarno met eyes with his enemies and friends, pleading for them to put nation above politics. Although it seemed like they sat in silence for centuries, eventually it was time for a decision. Sukarno watched anxiously as part of the room rose in affirmation, the other in negation, and a slim few abstaining. He couldn't tell from looking but he was hopeful, he had to be, there was nothing left to do. Sukarno resolved to stay stoic as the results trickled in, but the writing was on the wall, Sukarno's silver tongue could not save him this time."

 indonesia.27.desc:0 "A dense veil of mist and fog had descended to the streets of Jakarta, coating its streets and roads in a haze of incandescent neon lights and barely-glimpsed coconut trees. Through it, an engine thrummed. A Mitsubishi automobile, bearing the anonymous license plates of the Indonesian President's luxury car, pierced the curtain, threading its way through the jumble and tapestry that was the capital's street plan.\n\nA hand cranked the side-view window open. Puffs of smoke followed, joining the syrupy mix of vapors, industrial smog, and watery mist that made up Jakarta's atmosphere.\n\n"You enjoying that cigar," a thick, heavyset voice boomed from the driver's seat, "sir?"\n\n"Very." Under the low, evening light, and the segmented radiance of the streetlamps, the President of Indonesia sat in the rear of the car, dressed in a cheap, beige suit. A fedora chaperoned his thinning hairline. "You always find the finest stuff, don't you, Bagus? Good name. Good man. Your parents must've been proud."\n\n"I only aim to please," Bagus said, his tone full of viscous, unctuous satisfaction, "sir." He looked ahead. Their destination was getting closer, as the red, gleaming letters of Hotel Harris beamed ahead, spattering the grey mist with promises of carnal fulfillment. Bagus's foot gently pressed the brakes, and with a slow, subdued screech, the car ground to a halt.\n\nBagus got out first, before opening the rear doors for the President. "I hope you have fun, sir." The President answered him with a quiet nod and stepped into the hotel. Bagus saw the beige suit disappear behind the silhouette of the rotating doors. The camera should be upstairs in the President's room. Entering the Mitsubishi, Bagus took a fat roll of bills and started counting."

He glanced up to the blinding Indonesian sun and let its warmth wash over him. He acquiesced to himself, even if he felt he didn't need to be here. It was just nice to get out of the Palace.\n\nAfter an eternity of waiting, the distant roar of the engine shook Sukarno from his near slumber. About damn time. "Americans," Sukarno muttered to himself, "Always twenety minutes behind the rest of us." The sleek, jet black, motorcade made itself visible as it came over the hill. Sukarno could barely make out the man inside, was that Arief? Impossible! He knew that he went to America after war but the CIA? That seemed a little far fetched considering Sukarno's history with the boy who had almost gotten himself killed more than once. He was more trouble than he was worth in the Tentara Nasional, but Sukarno still felt some obiligation to the boy. Arief was the one who had saved Sukarno's life during a PKI terrorist attack. Sukarno retrieved his sunglasses from his pocket and put them on, well then, let's see how the boy has done in Hollywood then.\n\n"Hey Bung," the suited man said, "Long time no see."\n\n"Well, that was the point." Sukarno spat.\n\n"Yeah, yeah, I know, you don't want me around here I get it, but look Bung, we have some...footage of you."\n\nSukarno raised an eyebrow, "Yes and? I am the President of Indonesia, I would hope people see me."\n\nArief took a picture from his pocket and handed it to Sukarno. The President's face remained a straight thin line as he stared at the image. His heart skipped a beat, but Arief would never know. Quick, Sukarno recovered composure, "So they've sent you to threaten me? You'll need to do better than that I'm afraid." Sukarno scoffed and opened the door to his car. "Stay in America, Arief." Sukarno slammed the door and started the engine, the picture laying beside him on the passanger seat."

A gentle, golden light suffused their silhouettes - small fingers that seemed to catch the radiance of the sun. In the horizon, the National Monument stood, the frozen copper-fire atop it seemed to glow in indignant wrath against the storm clouds approaching from the sea. Sukarno gingerly picked a small, delicate cup full of tea and sipped its contents, taking care to enjoy the bitter aroma.\n\nSukarno was old. He could barely believe it this morning, as he glanced at the bathroom mirror. Creases and wrinkles covered his once-youthful visage, burying the image of a young man under the weight of the years. Everything, from the office cooled by air diffused by the air conditioner to the lazy, indolent waving of the faraway trees, seemed to lull the first and only President of Indonesia to sleep.\n\nA knock shuddered him awake. The secretary, Sumarni, had chosen this moment to check on him. The outline of her head appeared from the doorframe. "Sir," she said, an innocent smile on her lips, "a message, from the Japanese embassy." She laid a beige-tinted slip of paper before him, as he tried to rub the drowsiness out of his eyes. When he looked up, Sumarni was gone. It was a telegram. It read:\n\n"from the kempeitai END we know your proclivities END if you would like to cooperate with us contact us from the japanese embassy END if you do not there's no telling as to the consequences STOP"\n\nSukarno crumpled the piece of paper down the trash can beside his right foot.

Probably the latter. Settling down on his office desk, he pored over the day's litany of busywork. It shouldn't be too much. A lunch with Natsir and Hasbullah, the two capitals of the three-headed coalition, perched on top of his agenda.\n\nSumarni entered the room, dragging her high-heeled shoes through the flaming-red and batik-patterned rug. The sinuous curves seemed to follow her every step. "Lunch is canceled, sir." she said. "Both Mr. Natsir and Hasbullah have claimed to be ill." That was strange. How probable was it that the two of his government's most crucial and key men be sick on the same day, at the same hour?\n\n"Hand me the phone," he said, his nostrils flaring as if latching unto a hitherto unknown smell of rot. "I want to talk to them." He dialed their numbers and waited. No answers, only long buzzing on the telephone lines. Meanwhile, the Istana descended into chaos. Ministers failed to appear, leaving their departments running headless as busywork detonated into outright collapse.\n\nThe coalition was off. Sukarno took his hangover-addled mind aside, and thought. Where did it all go wrong?"

He looked out into his burning city and felt like he should be coming to some grand realization, it felt like Sukarno should've learned something from it all, but no, Sukarno was more firm in his belief than ever.

Once the press had gotten every picture they could, Sukarno had stepped down from the stairs, laughing at the casual conversation of the party leaders. Both men dwarfed Sukarno and yet, he had the largest presence in the room.\n\n"I'm glad to see that we'll be keeping stable for the next few years at least! It all depends when the old bats finally croak and the kids coming rushing into the Assembly!" Sukarno placed his hands on the backs of the politicians. "Maybe we can repurpose the lounge into a daycare!" The men laughed as they walked seemingly nowhere in particular. Sukarno had a destination in mind, however, far out of sight.\n\nSukarno's tone quickly changed as he boxed the pair into a corner. "Well of course, they'll have their ideas, but luckily they won't be much of a fuss, right? Not when the collapse of our government could risk...certain information from getting out."

It was a matter that had long been at the top of the agenda, only to be tabled for later discussion, be it because of apathy or just because no one was quite sure what to do. Ulama had been the party to bring the issue back to the limelight, but it was not because of any newfound compassion for children, no, Ulama and Masyumi stood as the only two parties with the power to do much. Sukarno had banned most other parties two years prior, he had made it within his power to dismantle any party he found harmful to the continuation of the nation. The two parties could not risk infighting under any circumstance, so the biggest issues would be ironed out first.\n\nHadikusum was relieved to see the teachers step down from the podium, having made their case for what changes needed to be made to transform Indonesia into the best nation it can be. Their proposals were simple, they needed more funding and a standardized curriculum. The answer to the first request was simple, they could throw a few extra Rupiah towards the schools, but the matter of the curriculum was surely one to divide the coalition.\n\nThe representative from Ulama rose to make their case, laying out the case for an education system that kept the best of both worlds, maintaining fierce patriotic views, while also ensuring the right of the educator to separate religion and education.\n\nHadikusum countered with the proposal his party crafted. The parties could meet in the middle, both agreeing that the importance of an Indonesian identity was paramount to teach to the children, but they should also be instilled with the faith of their neighbors.

The current discussion was a dangerous tight rope to walk, Sukarno's gaze swayed from side to side as each member nervously rose to speak on a more contentious issue; welfare.\n\nIndonesia prided itself on its disdain for the teachings of Marx, sometimes to a fault. Essential services could sometimes be caught up in the big tent of communism, never to be seen again. Both parties agreed to frame the debate from a matter of the budget, not on whether or not welfare was good for the nation, so as to not spark the ire of Sukarno. Ulama took the stance of granting more towards the people. Delivering speeches detailing how services necessary for some to survive, found their coffers drained. They spoke of the importance of a strong and robust safety net, pointing out that the people were only as strong as the Assembly granted them to be. For maximum prosperity, the people should be granted all they need to thrive.\n\nMasyumi once again took the side of the status quo, noting the importance of a balanced budget in a nation still getting its footing. Swaying Sukarno more towards temperance, promising that we could leave this subject open to debate and review it in the future when the economy proved itself worthy.\n\nTheir speeches could only mean so much and once again, it fell to Sukarno to decide if Indonesia would be receiving a safety net or a stable budget."

The punishment for the former was your own doing, people would choose to wake up every morning and decide to represent their community. In reality, very little representing would take place in Jakarta. When one passed through the gates of the Assembly, they stepped not onto the beautiful marble flooring, but straight on to the high wire. From then on, the challenge was not to sway the Assembly to act at the will of the constituents, but to avoid sparking the ire of the director of the worlds biggest act; Bung Karno.\n\nNo one will be content with watching a boring performance and it'll only be a matter of time before they demand their government makes real changes.

 indonesia.202.desc:0 "President Sukarno stared down the long table made of expensive imported wood. It's antiquity clashed spectacularly with the sharp modern sheen of the rest of the room. At the other end of the table were several young Japanese entrepreneurs and businessmen, with trimmed hair and expensive watches, dressed in the latest suits. The President, alone with the unnoteworthy exception of Minister Suwiryo, felt uncomfortably like the table in front of him.\n\n"So," the apparent ringleader of the businessman began, flashing a carefully manufactured smile. "We were absolutely delighted by your invitation to open negotiations. My associates and I will do everything in our power to make Indonesia a business friendly environment. With a few adjustments to legislation, some special economic privileges, and a synergistic approach to collaborative innovation and problem solving, Indonesia will transform from a primitive backwater to a model of Pan Asian triumph!"\n\nAs the perfectly dressed businessman finished his performance and his associates gave practiced nods and smiles, President Sukarno of Indonesia - apparently a primitive backwater in dire, urgent need of ruthless Japanese exploitation - decided to put on a show of his own. He slowly stood up and placed his hands on the old, wooden table. Though shorter than the smallest Japanese representative, he seemed to take up half the room. His figure cast an imposing shadow in the afternoon sunlight.\n\n"Indonesia will be strong with or without your assistance." he boomed, though it was not yet a shout. "There is profit to be made here, but you will not rape our land and people. We will meet tomorrow at the same time." He looked with disgust at the austere meeting room. "And we will hold the meeting in my personal conference room." He waved his hand and sat back down. "You are all dismissed."\n\nThe Japanese exchanged confused, shocked glances before finally exiting in an awkward shuffle."

 indonesia.203.desc:0 "Economic Minister Suwiryo held letters - addressed to Sukarno, from Hatta - in his hands. His eyes hungrily scoured the pages for information and secrets, commodities far more valuable than any precious metal. To his immense disappointment, there was nothing but recommendations to include greater benefits for the workers: safety laws, pensions, and the like, in the negotiations with the Japanese. The contents of the letters were, in Suwiryo's expert opinion as Economic Minister, liberal bullshit. No doubt Sukarno would love them, Suwiryo mentally scoffed.\n\nNo doubt Sukarno would love them.\n\nSuwiryo blinked as the deepest, oldest, reptilian matter of his brain whirred into action. He could present the ideas to Sukarno. He could claim he came up with them. Sukarno would trust him more. He could, conceivably, even influence the man.\n\nHe eyed the letters one last time before stuffing them in his briefcase and making his way through the labyrinthian offices to the next business meeting, stolen ideas at his side."

 indonesia.204.desc:0 "Uyeda Takahashi quickly scarfed down the bento his girlfriend had made him for lunch. He was sitting on a pile of brick and mortar near the oil well where he worked. As he ate his meal, he looked at the deplorable conditions of the small Indonesian town the oil well had spawned. Ramshackle huts had sprung up around the black gold, full of workers that had moved, voluntarily or otherwise, to serve as unskilled labor.\n\nHe regarded the Indonesians, the people that bowed when he walked past, that died so often building the machines he operated, that suffered extreme poverty, like one would consider a strange insect on the sidewalk. He finished his bento and started towards the oil well: his shift started in half an hour, but he had no desire to stick around. An Indonesian boy, no older than 13, ducked out of a large pile of scrap metal and called to him. Before he could pretend to ignore him, the boy ran up to Uyeda and started shaking his hand and speaking in Indonesian.\n\n"Thanks... father... work..."\n\nThe words flew over his head. Uyeda hadn't been entirely truthful with his employers concerning his proficiency in Indonesian. He knew enough to order around the workers at the oil well, but that was it.\n\n"Slow." Uyeda said, holding up his hands. "Slow, please."\n\nThe boy repeated himself again, slower than before. "Thanks... father... job... work... money... food... thanks..."\n\nUyeda pointed at the oil well. "Father work oil?"\n\nThe boy, resorting to the universality of the human face, smiled and nodded. He patted his stomach and held his palms against one another close to his cheek, miming sleep. He shook Uyeda's hand one more time before running back to town.\n\nUyeda watched the boy run off. He took another, newer look at the Indonesian town. For the first time since he had left Japan, he saw the people living there."

In contrast to his companions, he seemed far more at ease. Leaning back in his chair, despite its apparent instability, he sipped his imported Japanese tea. Sukarno and Suharto exchanged incredulous glances. Since when had Suwiryo been so... comfortable? Suwiryo finished his tea and flagged down a waiter.\n\n"I have some exciting news for both of you, concerning the reforms that you so wisely pursued." he said absentmindedly while the waiter took his cup. He folded his hands on the table and gave a genuine grin. "The data has been tabulated. Not only has the SKN increased total economic growth in a time of regional depression, but we have accumulated a surplus fund, which the government is free to do with as it, or rather you two, wish."\n\n"How much?" Suharto asked, a little quickly. "How much money?"\n\nSuwiryo smiled again, drew a pen from his coat, and wrote a figure on his napkin which he passed to Suharto. Suharto felt his jaw loosen and eyes widen.\n\n"We could overhaul the military with this. New equipment, new infrastructure, new everything."\n\n"The military is bloated enough." Sukarno stated. He was considerably less impressed than his general. "The money will go to the people." He leveled an accusatory finger at Suwiryo. "Your reforms have caused enough suffering."\n\nSuwiryo shrugged. He drank the tea that the waiter had just brought him.\n\n"I've done my job. Now you do yours.""

It's a monument to exploitation, to our subservience to Tokyo! Now is our time to correct our mistake and I can hear nothing but pitiful whimpering."\n\nEconomic Minister Suwiryo and General Suharto stood, side by side, in front of the desk. Neither of them moved, out of fear of provoking a reaction.\n\n"Sir, if I may," Suwiryo began. "Nationalization looks good from our perspective, but in the long run we run the risk of economic depression and instability, not to mention the ire of the Japanese." He pointed to a folder on the President's desk. "If you would just read the report I've assembled-"\n\n"We don't need a report to know the Japanese are raping Indonesia." Suharto interjected. "Mr. President, give me the authority I need to adjust the SKN and I promise that you won't be disappointed." He flashed his best winning smile.\n\nSukarno looked between the two men and stood up.\n\n"It's clear that neither of you will be any help."\n\nHe walked around the desk and out the office door.\n\n"I will take this issue to the people."\n\nAs the door slammed shut, Suharto and Suwiryo exchanged worried looks."

Their anger bleeds the air.\n\nSukarno, king of the mob, gives speech after tirade, denouncing the SKN and Japanese exploitation of Indonesia. His rage fuels the crowd. They feed off of his virile words like maggots on a dead horse.\n\nThe people are the hand of Sukarno. He flexes and contracts them like a muscle. The language of the riot, clearer than any other, gives the powers that be little choice.\n\nBy the end of the day, President Sukarno's latest decree, classifying the SKN as an illegal monopoly, passes unopposed."

President Sukarno stood in the middle of it all, Vice President Hatta conspicuously absent. He waved and smiled at the passing guests. His welcome was sincere; these people had a lot to offer him. Every person in the room with him was an accomplished, prominent businessman.\n\nMore importantly, they were all Indonesian.\n\nFollowing the nationalization and subsequent break up of the SKN, its bastard orphan children had to go somewhere. Where better than the infant Indonesia capitalist class?\n\nSukarno tapped his champagne glass with a spoon he had been saving in his pocket for that specific purpose.\n\n"Friends, Indonesians! We stand on the precipice of a new age for our nation! With the breakup of the illegal SKN and the subversion of Japanese influence, we can finally achieve our great, golden destiny. I am comforted greatly knowing that Indonesia's prosperity lies with such committed heroes, loyal to Indonesia above all else." With this, Sukarno spoke perhaps a little too loudly, smiled perhaps a little too brightly, and held his drink perhaps a little too tightly.\n\nPolite applause followed, but all understood the innuendo. Loyalty to Indonesia was loyalty to Sukarno. Resistance was ill advised.\n\nAs the party wore on, Sukarno grew irritable. Where was Hatta? He said he would be here.\n\nAt the other end of the room, a pleased Suharto counted his lucky stars that that liberal fool of a Vice President hadn't inspected his invitation too closely."

A gross gaggle of grotesque commoners, high off their own fumes, having forgotten the chain of command, having failed to see the catastrophic blunders of the PKI and of the popular movement at large. It should be apparent. It should be clear. There is a ruler and the ruled. As Fransiskus swirled the wine in its glass, he had no doubt that the police would be quick to shut down this disgusting display of indignity and self-aggrandizement, after all, the police carried a hefty price tag, and he wasn't about to let his money go to waste.\n\nHe could bare witness to the demonstration no longer, slamming the shutters shut with a thud, Fransiskus retreated to the gargantuan lavender chair that awaited a man of the upper crust such as himself in the study. He sipped at his wine, damn, it had gone bitter. Maybe rather, he had grown bitter. High atop his ivory tower, it was easy to forget that he could've ended up like them had it not been for his adoption into a family of status, Fransiskus did not find his inclusion in the crowd unfathomable. That wasn't reality however, he was not like them, savages.\n\nA clink at the window. Someone had thrown something. The roars of the crowd grew louder. Someone with a microphone. The heat from the sheer number of bodies made him tug at his collar. The police had done nothing. Slowly, he rose from the seat, his toes intertwined with the silk carpet, and ever so gently pulled back the curtain.\n\nThe sight was something out of any rich mans horror story. Thousands of bodies, of hearts and minds, dead set on the destruction of your livelihood. Fransiskus shuddered, in the middle of it all, atop a freshly erected platform, he could easily make out the shape of Sukarno, his finger thrusted into the air, chanting something he couldn't quite hear. Perhaps if he opened the window?\n\nA rock, jagged and heavy, made contact with his head in an instant. Sending him stumbling back, collapsing in a mess of broken glass and blood. "FORWARD!" he heard. The mahogany door of the entrance thumped and fell to the floor at the overwhelming strength of the people. As his vision faded to black, it became clear a terrible plague had infested his home, infested Indonesian society at large, populism."

His mother had promised to split from yet another typical night of rice and tempeh and make satay! Satay! Were they crying because they just could not contain their excitement for dinner?\n\nHe must've been distracted in his own thoughts, the ball was in his hand one moment, then it wasn't. He watched in what seemed to be slow motion as the ball hurtled towards the back of his father's head. Oh Allah save him, his dad was not a nice man when crying. When he got back from work in the evening, ayah would do the same thing, bang his head against the wall and just cry. The ball made contact and his father whipped around.\n\nRespati prepared himself for a beating, ready for the fists to fly, eyes closed, shrinking into his own skin. He waited for a moment. And another. And another. And nothing ever came. Cautiously, he ever so slightly opened one eye to see...his father smiling? It didn't make sense to be crying and happy at the same time at all! Why were grown ups so weird?\n\n"It's ok," His father spoke softly, using his forearm to dry his eyes. Ayah was holding something in his hand, a paper, plastered full with pictures of Bung Karno. Had Bung died?! That would be good reason to cry! Sure his dad wouldn't be smiling if that was the case? "Ayah? What's happening? Why are you crying?" He asked.""

Not a reckless plan of fiery rhetoric, but a calm, collected phone call, like adults, not children as heads of state with no goal beyond searching for scapegoat and speaking to the people of the greatness of a country he was instrumental in bringing down to the level of the rump states of Asia. Indonesians are not savages, but he could not blame the world for perceiving them as so when they were led by a glorified frat boy with an ego the size of Sumatra.\n\nA click on the other end.

Officially listed as a "Vital Infrastructure Watchman", strolling around the largest bank in Java was hardly vital and the only thing he really watched was the sheep in his brain as he drifted off to sleep. Gede rose from behind his desk and marched to the door. Where were his keys? He patted himself down looking for them, shimmying around, hoping to hear the jingle of the keys, all to no avail. With a shrug, Gede resigned from the search, who was stupid enough to break in here?\n\n"The PKI," Gede nearly jumped out of his skin. "Seems like they've been poking around the area, someone saw some kids beating up a shop down the road, spray painting PKI shit, the usual." The voice from the walkie talkie seemed bored and disinterested at least. Gede's biggest obstacle was staying awake, he'd never dealt with hooligans, terrorists he guessed he should call them.\n\nMustering his most confident voice, Gede answered back,"All good here, I'll keep an eye out on them." Readjusting his belt, the watchman returned to his rounds, lock the doors, turn off the lights, and sit in the main office until the morning shift arrived. How hard was that? He approached the black door and reached for his keys. "Oh fuck me." he whispered under his breath, he still had no idea where his keys were. Whatever, nothing would happen, it'll be fine, just some kids. He turned on his heel but only got a few feet before the slam of the door behind him froze him in place. Gede stood staring straight forward for a long time, not moving.\n\n"Nice going. Left the door wide open." A voice from behind him called. "You should know better, Gede." How did they know his name? "Unfortunately, your performance here tonight is not up to our standards by any margin." The slender body of his boss slinked out from behind him, "Miserable really, what if this was real Gede?

He didn't have much hair left, his father, but he was hellbent to rip out the rest. Ripping and tearing at his balding head at its very seams, his father paced, left to right and right to left and left to right and stop. He paused, for a breath? For peace? To break the monotony? To think. His father had stopped to think. The door before him led to a series of stairs, at the bottom of which was the certificate of his death, everything they needed, not that they needed an excuse anyways, to be shot.

His eldest, always the questioner, turned to his father, his mouth agape for sometime before finally struggling out a simple phrase, "I don't understand." The sheer astonishment of the young man provoked a chuckle from the bureaucrat, who simply smiled and flashed him a look to say, "I don't know either! And I'm loving every bit!"\n\n"We are Indonesians!" The box so bluntly proclaimed, "Is that phrase not liberating to say? For once, we are not divided by foreigners along arbitrary lines! The way I see it, I see a people who have been featured, who have seen hardships! Suffering like no other! We have seen doubt, discourage, and disunity!

What's incredible about crowds is how quickly they become one entity, one body, one soul. Together, the body screamed, showering Sukarno with their praise, and he drank every last drop.

I proudly plant the flag of Indonesia in the rotting corpse of suffering, of inequality, for we are one people, one Indonesia!" Most didn't know what poverty was, let alone victory, and yet the genuine smile of the president told them a story thousands of chapters long, it taught them that something beautiful and rare stood before them, a friend.\n\nHe hated to close a speech, he'd drag on forever if he could, just to recount where he had eaten today if he had the time, before him were his people and he would speak to his people. Yet even Sukarno must bow to the bureaucracy and with one last gulp, he soaked in the last of their affection. "Well done."

You come into my office and plop yourself down in this chair and sulk, why?"\n\n"You'd know if you'd read my letters, or met me where planned, or even answered the damn phone!" Hatta slammed the table and rose from his seat, his nostrils flaring as he huffed and puffed.\n\nSukarno rose slowly from his seat, pushing back the chair, and placed one hand on the shoulder of his Vice President and friend, "Hatta, believe me when I say I have no idea what you're talking about. I've noticed your absence, but assumed you were simply on vacation."\n\nVaction? Hatta chewed on the word as his he focused on the eyes of the man across him.

Had we had it our way, Indonesia would've continued down the path of success and prosperity. Everything seemed so perfect, only to be ripped away by an opportunistic friend turned snake.\n\nGeneral Suharto has not just drafted a plan, he has meticulously planned out the demise of the breakaway republic to the smallest and most insignificant detail."

 INS_The_Blockade_desc:0 "Sukarno is no idiot. He understood long ago that of conflict were to come to Indonesia proper, most of the fighting wouldn't take place in the cities or the jungles, but rather the oceans. Indonesia is a complex body, it's organs spread out and the nerve system wide and open, it only took a man to cut one of the arteries for the entire structure to collapse in on itself. Such is why Sukarno prioritized the naval budget so many years ago, weather he would be fighting the Americans, the Japanese, or even his own people, it had been clear for the longest time that the battle on the high seas would decide the fate of the nation.\n\nAs such, if Sukarno could utilize the navy to blockade the capitol of Hatta's state, total victory would be on the horizon."

 INS_Guide_The_Holdouts_desc:0 "While the original draft of Operation Phoenix X called for the quick encirculation of the capitol via the blockade, a major military maneuver, and a through stabilization plan, Hatta has proven himself more than resilient and more than willing to continue this fight to the last man. We are just as adaptable as the rouge revolutionary. Our encirclement and blockade strategy sends a much more powerful message than simply occupying a rebel town, by starving them out we can shift them away from Hatta and back into the loving arms of the President. After all, don't they remember the times where Sukarno kept the country safe? What has Hatta done for them but left their children dead and their village burned? Nothing. They will surely realize this and come crawling back faster than one can say Merdeka!"

 INS_Cut_Off_Aceh_desc:0 "The northern tip of Northern Sumatra is home to the Aceh people, a rebellious and fiercely independent group who, even in peace, continue to prove themselves a thorn in the side of the government. Whether it be from some ideological alignment or simple ending up fighting against a common enemy, the people of Aceh have thrown their weight behind Hatta and his already diverse coalition.\n\nGenerals Suharto and Nasution held opposing viewpoints on how best to handle the impending conflict but, in a rare moment of clarity between the two, spurred on by the dire situation of the country, met in the middle with their solution to the Aceh problem: simply leave them alone. The Aceh have been put down before and will most certainly be put down again but the bigger threat is dealing with Hatta and the Indonesian army is not prepared well enough to combat an partisan packed province whilst a civil war rages on."

The team's orders are simple.\n\n1. Eliminate outer defenses.\n\n2.Lead the army into the city proper.\n\n3.Find Hatta and bring him to his knees.\n\nFailure means death."

The city was a second home to the president, somewhere he could always turn back to when the times got hard. Well, times are hard now, and Palembang is just out of reach.\n\nThe brass says the city carries much strategic importance but Sukarno would personally lead the charge to the city if it meant dying in its warm embrace. Palembang must be captured. Palembang will be captured. This the army and Sukarno can agree on, it was only a matter of time before he'd be on its sandy beaches once more."

Although largely composed of the more liberal minded people of Indonesia, Medan is not completely committed to Hatta's cause. Some simply keep their heads down to avoid the horrors of war coming to their homes, even if they'd prefer not to live under what Hatta calls a "democratic republic".\n\nGeneral Suharto has connections, to some, it's as if the man sees and knows all. While it may occasionally give Sukarno the jitters, it also can prove extremely helpful in getting the people of Medan to stand up for what they believe in, to stand up for Sukarno! Having people inside the city will make occupying it infinitely easier."

He had seen his men strung up by their feet by Hatta's generals, their eyes and tongues missing, their skulls broken and bleeding, if they were lucky enough to keep their heads attached to their bodies at all. If Hatta endorses their actions or not, it does not matter. What matters is that Hatta took this beautiful, peaceful, nation and turned it into a bloodbath.

Television, radio, and public meetings all give the people hope, but not only that, it provides them with reassurance, that everything will be alright in the end, that there is a competent administration in place to ensure the return to stability.\n\nThe battle for Indonesia is not just a battle of who can shoot the fast, drop the most bombs, or shell the most islands, but it is a battle between personalities, between which bombastic and firebrand leader can out speak the other. Sukarno is a natural speaker and Hatta cannot compare."

The civilian government is not properly equipped to deal with the outbreak of war, even if some generals occupy the seats in government. A completely war centered cabinet will be best equipped to tackle the issue of Hatta's rebellion. Suits do not know war, economists cannot manipulate the markets into winning a battle, and foreign ministers cannot negotiate with Hatta into submission. The people demand action! It is time for the government to deliver! Sukarno has lived his whole life in battle and he is properly equipped with not only the experience but also the resolve to bring Hatta to justice and return to the way things were. Merdeka!"

Sukarno has seen war. What all this has taught him is how to win and what makes you lose. The key to success in battle is not to wait for pencil-pushers to complete the proper paperwork to approve a maneuver. The Assembly is not fit to serve Indonesia through this crisis, it simply wasn't made to deal with the situation before us now. The Assembly, even if it is nothing more than a puppet show for the people to be entertained with, is still packed with some opposition, just to make the performance life like. It's too much a risk to let the Assembly operate as it is, we aren't even close to being in a situation where the slightest mistake is admissible, it's now or never.

They think that causing chaos and spreading terror will bring us to our knees but look at where you are today! You are still standing tall, this fire they've lit has not made us flee, but inspired us to act!

Generals Nasution and Suharto have made impressive work of Hatta's army but yet the war rages on. What most tend to forget is that Sukarno is no stranger to drafting and executing military operations.\n\nEven if old age has taken away much of Sukarno's ability to lead his people into battle, his mental shape is sharper than ever. The last few weeks, Sukarno has rarely left his room, only exiting to speak to his wife and to the people. Few have seen inside his room, but what few reports trickle out from hospitality staff and passing generals paints the room of a manic freak, with maps and diagrams plastered on the walls and floors. Known only as "The Hundred Days Campaign", the plan promises to end the civil war within one hundred days. While this promises to breathe new life into a demoralized fighting force, it's also a tall order. Should Sukarno not meet his goal, there may be consequences..."

 INS_Surabaya_Defiant_desc:0 "Simply due to its size, there are more cities, towns, and villages in Indonesia than even the government could cover within the census. During his deliberations, Sukarno weighed his options as he considered his situation. What cities pledged loyalty to Hatta? Which to Sukarno himself? There were even some who claimed neutrality in the on-going conflict. Every attack undertaken, every broken defense, every operation stalled; it was another man dead, another man radicalized, it was another kilometer that the Indonesia Sukarno loved drifted away from him. Regardless, Sukarno did not devote his life to leadership just to quit when the going got tough, no, now more than ever it was time to set emotions aside.\n\nSurabaya will not stay in the hands of Hatta. No matter what."
 INS_Ease_Rationing:0 "Ease Rationing"
 INS_Ease_Rationing_desc:0 "As much as Sukarno is a brilliant strategist when it comes to the battlefield, the last twenty years have given Sukarno more than enough experience in public relations to know that besieged cities would be quick to defect once the food shipments stopped arriving. It's difficult to estimate the stability of the supply situation, but Sukarno knows one thing plain and simple; a powerful mandate from the people was more resilient than any armor, more destructive than any artillery piece, and more critical than the air he breathed.\n\n"Even if it'll complicate the food situation," Sukarno commanded, "nothing is more complicated than dealing with a starving Indonesian."
 INS_Secure_Sulawesi:0 "Secure Sulawesi"
 INS_Secure_Sulawesi_desc:0 "Just to the west of the spice islands, the island of Sulawesi is often written off by not only the preeminent powers of the world, but sometimes even by Indonesians themselves, simply due to the geographical size and population of the island. Sukarno fancies himself the father of Indonesia, one who doesn't pick favorites, but if he did, the island of Sulawesi would certainly be a contender for the top spot. From Sukarno's bravery against the western imperialists to his budget somehow always fitting the island in the budget, the proud people of Sulawesi know one thing to be true, Sukarno is there to help.\n\nEven so, dissenters and rabble-rousers will always make themselves known at the least opportune time. While most of the island had thrown their weight behind Sukarno, it'll be impossible to accomplish the goals of the hundred days campaign without fully securing the island."
 INS_Further_Centralization:0 "Further Centrailzation"
 INS_Further_Centralization_desc:0 "What may seem a wise idea in times of peace is rarely so in a time of war. Keeping the structure of Indonesia generally decentralized was particularly appealing to a younger Sukarno, keeping his enemies close and his sending his allies to essentially govern their island as their own made sense. What Sukarno did not account for in his naivety, was that the blow would not come from outside his government, but from inside, by his own friend no less.\n\nNow, the decentralized army and governance structures are not only ineffective but a threat to the security of the nation. Allowing governors to run their garrisons completely independent of Jakarta enabled them to mold two generations of youth into their own ideology. It's time to eradicate their foolish notions of independence in action.\n\nThere is no higher authority than Jakarta."

With such a large sample size of sandy beaches and tranquil oases, it's simply a matter of which ones are critical to the continuation of the nation and which can be left as they are for now, to liberate or stabilize later.\n\nAt least so says the top brass.\n\nThe fact is that in the eyes of Sukarno, every island matters just as much as any other! On them are Indonesians! People who have entrusted to Sukarno their safety and the safety of their children. He cannot sit idly by and allow this injustice to take place. No Indonesian matters more than any other and no island is more significant than the last! Indonesia will be liberated in whole!"

While never reaching the levels of rebellion of the people of Aceh, Papauians have been showing their disdain for the government with more underground methods. Sabotaging mines, spray painting stores and bases, and preaching anti-Indonesian propaganda is commonplace on the island. While the government may not be particularly popular, Sukarno himself enjoys high amounts of support in the larger cities.\n\nThe rural villages and cities still harbouring Australians from two decades prior have fallen more in line with Hatta's destructive vision. Papua has too much to offer to let it fall into the hands of Hatta entirely, who knows how many American guns he could buy with the precious minerals under the Papuaian people?"
 INS_Kemenangan:0 "Kemenangan"
 INS_Kemenangan_desc:0 "The Hundred Days Campaign was not only the greatest military operation devised by the President in all his years of service, but it was also a labour of love. Finally, the President approaches victory. Victory in protecting his people, victory in the battle of personalities between himself and Hatta, but above all, victory in the battle of ideology. Sukarno knows the path Indonesia must follow to not only succeed but flourish in the modern world. Hatta's tactics of coalition building only weakens himself and leaves the door wide open to infighting and squabbling between parties. It's unfortunate really, Sukarno for so long had believed Hatta shared his vision. The President must shake those thoughts from his head, no where in his plans did he call for addition of emotion to war. Hatta is the enemy. Sukarno will defeat the enemy. Kemenangan!"

With the eternity of the Java taking shots at each other, it is no surprise that Bandung has found itself caught in the crossfire. While the city will never be the same, devastated by bombings, gunfire, and gurreila warfare, it will not fall. Sukarno has declared Bandung a frontline city, one that must be defended, no matter the cost. If Bandung were to capitulate to the rebel forces, it would be a slippery slope from there. Jakarta would surely be next, and from there, Sumatra in its entirety would be cut off from Sukarno's forces. No matter who must die, what tactics must be used, Bandung will not share the fate of so many other cities. If the Tentara Nasional can keep the city out of Hatta's hands, all the while forcing him to commit more and more resources to the struggle, it will enable an easy transition from a defensive line to an offensive one! Victory will be assured, so long as Bandung proudly boasts he Indonesian flag!"

 INS_Redemption_Brigades_desc:0 "Using criminals in war is usually a last resort, something for desperate and broken states to muster together in a last ditch effort to broker a peace. Indonesia is not at that point now, nor will it ever be. That doesn't stop Sukarno, however, from putting these emergency plans into practice early. Why pull any punches? There are no do-overs, a general cannot slap his forehead and say "I wish I had performed the assault!" and suddenly all is right in the world. No, the assault must be made, the garrison reinforced for Indonesia itself depends on it.\n\nThey may grumble, they may moan, but in the end, this is their last chance to prove that they can be rehabilitated, that at heart, despite their crimes. Sukarno's offer of amnesty is genuine, whether out of fear or as a genuine olive branch to some of the most elite paramilites who occupied the prisons of Indonesia. They fight not only for themselves but for Indonesia!"

Pushing headfirst against Hatta in attempt to catch him off guard seemed like the best move at the time and one can hardly blame Sukarno for attempting to capitalize on the situation, Hatta's coalition of radical muslims and hardline communists seems destined to implode on itself. It's time for a readjustment in strategy, the long game is one Sukarno is much better equipped to win.

American equipment is not only more technologically advanced, but more plentiful. The American industrial capability is much higher than anything the industrialists in Indonesia could hope to achieve. If Hatta is going to call in the big dogs, Sukarno finds no reason to not do the same. Establishing a hotline between Jakarta and Tokyo will make sure that Indonesia does not fight alone, but with her allies in Asia. Regardless, who has the most experience in doing battle with the Americans? The Japanese. On that same note, who has won the most wars against the Americans? The Japanese.

Yet, what are Indonesians if not a resilient people? One willing to fight to the bitter end for what they believe in? In no circumstances is rationing popular, but public relations have been tossed to the wayside as of now.

He can continue the draft, thrust more rifles into the hands of boys and slap their backs goodbye as they are shipped off to die. The emotional strain is apparent on the President, but as far as the generals are concerned, conscription is a necessary sacrifice to balance out Hatta's American equipment and volunteers. It troubles the President, but at this point, what more is there to do? If he were to announce the end of the draft today, he would not only be seen as weak, the army would simply be overrun by Hatta. It's unfortunate, but completely necessary.

While the plan was drafted in a joint effort between Sukarno, Suharto, and Nasution, who would be leading the operation was left initially vague. Securing the island means cutting the head of Hatta's rebellion right away and whoever accomplishes the daunting task will surely receive a large boost in prestige and find many promotions in their future.

In May 1946, he was appointed regional commander of the Siliwangi Division, which looked after the security of West Java. In this position, Nasution developed the theory of territorial warfare which would become the defence doctrine of the Indonesian Army in the future. It is because of this, Nasution is more than well equipped to lead the offensive into Hatta's powerbase."

Suharto exhibits all the best quality of a soldier, loyalty, cunning, and an unwavering commitment to finish the task before him. With such a big task before them, Sukarno can't risk waiting on Nasution's defensive tactics. This rebellion must end now, before any more pledge their allegiance to Hatta and to the Americans.

Native Borenoians who are still loyal to Sukarno, as few as they are, have already been made contact with and an invasion force will have men on the inside as well.\n\nAn operation such as this one requires the full support of the entire nation, thousands will be involved in the plan, ensuring the supply chain remains intact, and executing the mission itself.

While the North Borneo garrison has declared itself officially neutral in the conflict at the behest of Tokyo, they have offered to supply advisors and men to the upcoming operation. Sukarno has denied this offer outright, Indonesians started this war and Indonesians will finish this.

Yet, what wasn't quite accounted for, was a revolution of this scale. Many revolts and uprisings have taken place over the last twenty years, but all of them have been squashed.

To some, Sukarno was a God, but it was becoming clear that his fellowship was dwindling. His flock began to weed out the true believers and the snakes in his garden and Sukarno could not be happier. Although the people had taken up arms against him, he had seen the hope he inspired in people, and it was enough to shrug off the doubt that swirled in his mind. Sukarno was famous for his speeches, he had an impeccable ability to rouse the apathetic to his cause, not with threats of violence or with ideology instilled from brainwashing, Sukarno was someone to talk to, he was Bung Karno after all.\n\nHe hadn't made a war speech in twenty years, he had grown accustomed to speeches for businessmen, speeches where he inspired laughter, not bloodlust, but at a time like this, could laughter be found anywhere? The capital had been put under lockdown and the Merdeka Palace converted to a military base. This was the threshold, the final test for the Indonesian people, and the results rested on their shoulders alone, the best Sukarno could do was to take a little weight off with a rousing message. His advisors had urged him to broadcast from the radio, but Sukarno wasn't a coward, he didn't fear the Dutch, he did not cower from the Japanese, he would not hide from his own people.\n\nSukarno grinned to his followers, "You have seen what we have built! How lucky you are to be Indonesian! How lucky you are to be prosperous! Do you know what the rioters are my friends? Jealous.

Frankly, we weren't left with much, but those still around are the cream of the crop."\n\nSukarno flipped through the files, only half-reading them. "Too wild." Sukarno tossed one aside.

Sukarno had been tested before, fighting against the Dutch, maneuvering against the Japanese businessmen, spending sleepless nights coordinating operations to maintain the fragile peace in the fledgling state. Sukarno had passed them all, standing tall atop a mountain of bodies, hands gripped on the wheel, ready to steer the country towards greatness. It was when he grew fat and content at the top of the food chain did Sukarno realize he had softened, letting subordinates get away with more and more. As he tore open yet another letter decrying his government, Sukarno swore to never soften again.\n\nHe had predicted from the start that factionalism would be the spear to pierce the heart of hawk-eagle, that once the soaring bird was brought down by a united front against Indonesian power, the vultures would circle and pick at its corpse. It made him sick to his stomach, to see everything he built go to waste at the whim of the power-hungry and the foolish. He gripped a letter tight in his clammy fist, imagine what could've been accomplished if he had been granted the powers he deserved! He certainly wouldn't have been in this situation to begin with. Where had it all gone wrong? That night in Palembang? Permitting some of the more wishy-washy governors to maintain their posts? No, the root of the problem had existed since the nation's inception, the politicians.\n\nSukarno retrieved a pen and paper, it was time for a letter of his own, this time he would not beg on his knees for the continued support of the military or for the Assembly to grant him the blank check needed, no, as the pen flowed on the paper, Sukarno resolved an issue he should've rectified decades ago. The words naturally came to him, there was no need for legal speak or grandiose politicking, the decree was simple; the representatives didn't need to show up to their posts the next morning, the Assembly would be suspended until further notice."

As Sukarno preached, however, the Indonesian people do not want another war, they do not want to be made the playground of the international community, they want only to work and to flourish. While the simple goal is admirable, the situation demands a change of course.\n\nSukarno held much of the default support, he had devoted his entire life to the independence of Indonesia and the people recognized that. They had heard his speeches, seen his scars, some few even fought alongside him, but much could be said of Hatta as well. The two played a tug-of-war over the people, vying for control of enough of the masses to overwhelm their enemies. Hatta could not compare in the battle of oration, and yet, the number of recruits dwindled day by day. It seemed to Sukarno that perhaps it did not take words to vex one to fight, it took vision. The people today held sight in higher standing than hearing, what Hatta could not accomplish in a speech, he could compensate for by warping the perception of the standard of living\n\nIt was playing dirty, tricking the people into joining the cause of Hatta by speaking half-truths. Two could play at that game. Though Sukarno felt some resignation as he sat down to author his next decree, he put his mind at ease with visions of the future, when he could return to the prosperity and, more importantly, the normalcy of the early sixties."

Their tactics have changed and so must ours.\n\nToo many potential rebels have slipped through the army's fingers due to a lack of reasonable suspicion. Too many patrols have been lost due to a pervasive unwillingness to pursue the most effective means of intelligence gathering.

 #Indonesia Peace Events#
 indonesiapeace.1.t:0 "Time's up."
 indonesiapeace.1.desc:0 "Suharto stopped before the gargantuan mahogany doors to the bedroom of Sukarno. Two guards, armed, stood sentry at both sides. Suharto only need raise an eyebrow and the two were off. They had their payment. Suharto crept in, on the far left side of the room sat a tall white bed, a thick lump occupying its center. Suharto flicked on the lights. Immediately, the lump stirred to life. "The nerve, do you even know the time?" Questioned Sukarno.\n\nSuharto chuckled under his breath, "I know. It's ridiculous." Sukarno's face was frozen in a confused frown. Suddenly, Sukarno thrashed in his bed, throwing the covers off him and ripping open the drawer of the bedside table. Sukarno kept his eyes locked with Suharto's as he desperately floundered around, searching for an object that was there. Suharto's bored face slowly morphed into a grin. "It's not there Bung."\n\n"Guards! Help me!" Sukarno cried.\n\n"No ones coming Sukarno. I think what's sad about you is that you're no better than any men you've sent off to die, you fear, you want, you love. You talk a lot of talk, but when push comes to shove, you are nothing, rendered a misrable, feeble nothing." Suharto dropped into a sprint, charging towards Sukarno. His time in the military had trained him for this but he had been planning this for years, even long before the civil war began. He grabbed the old man by the neck and pressed down, vaulting himself up and on to the bed, crouching over top of him. He watched Sukarno squirm, he bled as he clawed at his skin, but Suharto felt nothing, he hadn't in a long while.\n\nLong after the revolutionary expelled his last breath, Suharto sat on top of him, squeezing as hard as he could. After hours, decades, centuries maybe of squeezing every last modicum of life out of the president, Suharto slowly climbed off him and straightened out his jacket. This was only the first phase, now it was onto the next. Suharto glanced at his watch as he closed the door behind him, leaving Sukarno in his palace. His agents were probably just making contact with Hatta. It was less than ideal to make a deal with Hatta but he didn't have much of a choice. There was no turning back now."
 indonesiapeace.1.a:0 "Prepare the unity government!"
 indonesiapeace.2.t:0 "Victory in the Civil War"
 indonesiapeace.2.desc:0 "Indonesia was at peace. The last holdouts thundered in the soft rain, the remaining generals formulated hopeless counterattacks, and the final, desperate pleas for a negotiated settlement were made, but Indonesia was at peace.\n\nThe war, like a gruesome butcher's knife, divided the nation. Brother fought brother. Father killed son. Friend turned on friend. It was a battle of armies as much as personalities. No one knew this sad reality better than Hatta.\n\nHe had hoped to save Sukarno. He couldn't, and he wouldn't, pardon his crimes, but he could at least stay his execution. For all his faults, his terrible, bloody faults, he was still his friend. He was still the man who had built Indonesia. He had still done what he thought was right. He was still Bung.\n\nThe PKI militias, drunk on their violent mob justice, didn't give him that chance. They didn't see Bung. They saw a tyrant, reduced his identity to his crimes, and strung him up accordingly.\n\nSukarno was gone. Indonesia remained.\n\nAs Hatta prepared to greet the crowds, to meet with the radical leaders of parallel revolutions, and to build a new, different Indonesia, he couldn't help but imagine Sukarno standing beside him, advising him, joking with him, even arguing with him. As Hatta stepped, uncertain, into the future, Sukarno's phantom followed him like a shadow, coloring the whole of Indonesia a perfect grey for many years to come."
 indonesiapeace.2.a:0 "We bleed and die as blind men, seeing that there is nothing to fight for, laugh."
 indonesiapeace.3.t:0 "Victory in the Civil War"
 indonesiapeace.3.desc:0 "President Sukarno, the rightful, or at least victorious, leader of Indonesia stared blankly across the waving, bouncing field of people. They were cheering. All of them. Sukarno didn't understand why.\n\nHe was relieved, certainly, but not happy. How could he be happy? He looked at the papers in his hands. A speech, written by General Suharto. The President had wanted to deliver his own impassioned monologue to the adoring masses but, for some reason, he did not have the resolve to refuse the general's request. Sukarno's forehead creased in confusion. Since when did he do what Suharto told him to?\n\nHe briefly glanced over at the man. Unlike the rest of Sukarno's entourage, he was smiling. He had a huge, positively ecstatic grin plastered over his fat face. He looked like a gambler who had put everything on black and walked away a millionaire. Sukarno tilted his head. Since when did Suharto smile?\n\nNext to him sat Defense Minister Nasution. A grim weight pulled his mouth downwards into a distasteful frown. Sukarno mirrored the frown. He had already seen the plans. The terrible, sharp diagrams and reports. The war was won, but resistance would certainly continue. Nasution's job was to end that resistance as quickly as possible by any means necessary. Unfortunately for the rebels, Nasution's definition of necessity was terrifyingly liberal.\n\nSukarno turned back to the screaming, proud storm of people. For a few dozen minutes he was President Sukarno, savior of Indonesia. The speech was grand. The tempo of inflammatory wit and adulation of the crowd moved back and forth in tandem. At the end, as he made his last, blazing promises, he almost forgot he was a player on a stage.\n\nWhen he finished and the last chants had died down, he took his seat as another, less important official gave his own performance. He turned to Hatta, his Vice President and friend, to ask him how he did. Was it good? What did you think? He knew he could always count on him for honest criticism and pertinent advice.\n\nBut Hatta wasn't there. Hatta was gone - had been gone - for a long time. The backdrop fell away. The spotlight moved on. The curtains closed around Sukarno. His role had reached its conclusion; The play was over."
 indonesiapeace.3.a:0 "Our movement is contained within a larger one that carries us along as inexorably as the wind and current."
 indonesiapeace.4.t:0 "Olive Jungles"
 indonesiapeace.4.desc:0 "Hatta listened to the thunder gently rumble outside his office window. The light grey sky blanketed the earth, as though comforting it with well meaning, yet inadequate, care. The drizzle tapped the roof in a soft rhythm.\n\nHatta turned away from the rain and focused on the document in front of him. It was an offer of peace from the rival Indonesian government. The proposal was simple enough: an immediate cessation of hostilities and the creation of a unity government with Hatta as President. The message was notable, not only for its content, but because it was signed with the authority of General Suharto and not President Sukarno.\n\nHatta had heard rumors. The whispers of spies and traitors quickly found their ways to his ear, but he had refused to believe them. Sukarno? Couped? Unlikely. Yet the proof lay on his desk and no choice remained but to confront it.\n\nHe would accept the offer, of course. He was tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of the endless tough calls and crisis. Most of all, he was tired of watching the nation he loved destroy itself a hundred times over. The Islamists would hate it, but they would fall in line. The communists would go kicking and screaming, but they would go nonetheless.\n\nHatta returned to the flying droplets of water. They fell through the air, their lives brief accelerations to the earth. The ground was certain, yet they struggled towards it all the same. The thunder rolled onwards, the raindrops journeyed from the heavens, and Hatta composed his response to Suharto, accepting his terms and deciding the fate of Indonesia."
