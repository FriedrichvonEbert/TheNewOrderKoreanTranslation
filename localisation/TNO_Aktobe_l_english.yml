 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ONOPRIENKO_DESC:0 "Colonel Nikolai Onoprienko did all he could to fight for the Soviet Union, but now he fights for Kazakhstan. A soldier during the war, Onoprienko achieved great victories during his career and quickly became one of the more decorated Kazakhs in the Soviet army. as the Germans pushed east, Onoprienko was ordered away from the front lines. He became the commander of a peacekeeping division with the goal of maintaining order in his home region of Aktobe, Kazakhstan, in the wake of Soviet collapse.\n\nEventually, Onoprienko came to realize that the Soviets were holding Kazkhstan back - not driving it forward. Onoprienko and his fellow officers eventually split from Momyshuly's Kazakh government to create their own military clique. He personally authored an ideology based around discipline, combining the best elements of communism, capitalism, and fascism, known as National Renewal. His clique has a firm control of the Aktobe region, with his headquarters in Aktobe. He is destined to bring Kazakhstan into the 20th century, even if it is kicking and screaming in the meanwhile - or he will die trying."

 ARL_national_renewal_desc:0 "Led by a clique of radical officers, the National Renewal Party stands for discipline and professionalism in the factories as well as the barracks and will stop at nothing to bring their vision for a modern Kazakh nation to every corner of the country."
 ARL_breakneck_industrialization:0 "Breakneck Industrialization"
 ARL_breakneck_industrialization_desc:0 "Following the National Renewal Party's victory, Kazakhstan has been led into a new age of industrialization. Mines are swallowing up the landscape as tens of thousands of farmers are leaving their fields to live and work in the ever-growing cities and factories that characterize the new Kazakhstan."
 ARL_spreading_famine:0 "Spreading Famine"
 ARL_spreading_famine_desc:0 "Across the nation, hunger stalks the streets. With the farms unattended and more and more people moving to the cities every day we simply don't have enough food to go around. Officially the Party's line is that the shortages are a temporary growing pain, but internal studies have shown that if we don't scale back our industrialization program soon, the death toll will be catastrophic."

 ARL_The_Pragmatists_Of_The_Kazakh_Steppe_desc:0 "All around the ruins of what was once known as Kazakhstan, you see ideologues. Islamists, Communists, Fascists... no, none can do. Ideology must take a backseat in favor of true progress and pragmatism, and thankfully we take this lesson to heart. We will adapt what works, and Kazakhstan will be reborn by our hand."
 ARL_Entrenching_Onoprienkos_Hold:0 "Entrenching Onoprienko's Hold"
 ARL_Entrenching_Onoprienkos_Hold_desc:0 "While President and Party Chairman Onoprienko already has a relatively strong hold upon the National Renewal Party and the city of Aktobe itself, if we are to reach out to the entirety of Kazakhstan we have to eliminate Party infighting; and the best means tod this end is by further strengthening the President's hold. This way, he can better enforce the standards of the Party, and better define its principles in the future."
 ARL_Create_The_Land_Registry:0 "Creating The Land Registry"
 ARL_Create_The_Land_Registry_desc:0 "While the hated German still sends out bombing patrols with some frequency over our lands, this doesn't mean we cannot prepare for the possibility of these patrols stopping. One of the Party members has proposed the creation of a Land Registry to catalogue all land within our grasp, and when the bombings end we will simply fill it in and jot down anything of interest. Preparation pays off, and Party Chairman Onoprienko is ready to sign off to this plan."
 ARL_Formalize_National_Renewal_Thought:0 "Formalize National Renewal Thought"
 ARL_Formalize_National_Renewal_Thought_desc:0 "With his hold secure, Chairman Onoprienko has seen it fit to start further formalizing National Renewal Thought and define just what does the party stand for in more specific terms, and what are its principles. It may take some haggling and some negotiations, but the Chairman's will is powerful enough to see this through."
 ARL_The_Khromtau_Security_Forces:0 "The Aktobe Security Forces"
 ARL_The_Khromtau_Security_Forces_desc:0 "The sword and shield of the Party and Nation, the Aktobe Security Forces are the foremost means we enforce our control within our territory... which we unfortunately have to keep near the city itself most of the time due to the bombings. General Jamangarayev and other leading figures within the KSF however have come forward with some proposals of improving their theoretical basis, and preparing them for the day the bombings end. All these ideas need are a signature of Chairman Onoprienko's pen..."
 ARL_Planning_For_The_Countryside:0 "Planning For The Countryside"
 ARL_Planning_For_The_Countryside_desc:0 "Communications between city and country may be hardened by the bombings, but we can still prepare ourselves for the day the bombings end; by using whatever maps we have on hand of the area, we can devise new tactics and stratagems to take proper control of the rural areas of our territory in a most timely and efficient manner."
 ARL_Civil_Defense:0 "Civil Defense"
 ARL_Civil_Defense_desc:0 "We may sit within our urban holds and plan for the day the German flying horrors no longer roam the sky, but all of our planning will be for naught if we do not try and keep the people under our command safe; or at least the ones we can actually get to. By rehearsing more efficient bunker drills and ways to inform the urban population of the bombers' approach and what to do in case of Luftwaffe bombing events, we will better preserve our manpower for the coming struggles."
 ARL_A_Political_Blueprint:0 "A Political Blueprint"
 ARL_A_Political_Blueprint_desc:0 "The National Renewal Party is not just one of the many contenders for the reunification of Kazakhstan, but it is also a living blueprint for the Nation's future. A blueprint that will always update itself, and one that will always remain valid. And just like a blueprint is eternally embodied by the resulting building, so must the new Kazakhstan we will build be an eternal embodiment of our political blueprint. A perfect union, now and forever."
 ARL_Reviewing_The_Doctrine:0 "Reviewing The Doctrine"
 ARL_Reviewing_The_Doctrine_desc:0 "As the expansion of the Aktobe Security Forces continues, the issue of revision and rethinking of our main military doctrine poses itself with great immediacy. In most cases, our officer staff still operates on a replica of the old Soviet doctrines which they also compliment with their own unique 'innovations', making our organization a nightmare to deal with. It appears obvious that outdated Soviet tactics, which failed to save the incompetent leadership of Moscow against the German war machine and preserve the indivisibility of Kazakhstan, no longer reflect the realities of the modern war and in most cases are not fit to even fight against the gangs of bandits to the east of us. Though nobody in the region presents an instant danger to us, for reasons of their self-preservation in the face of never-ending German bombings, outlining a new centralized doctrine by our talented and reliable generals is one of the top priorities for our state if we want to establish a modern and professional military force in the aftermath of the Nazi terror program."
 ARL_Manuals_Of_Arms:0 "Manuals Of Arms"
 ARL_Manuals_Of_Arms_desc:0 "In a similar manner to the officer staff, regular soldiers come to our ranks without any special training and education that are necessary for any defender of Kazakhstan. As a result, a typical soldier can't follow his orders, can't properly handle military equipment and can't comply with discipline. This situation is unacceptable for us if we want to create an efficient army that's ready to disrupt every invasive plan of our enemies. The new drill regulations for Aktobe Security Forces should be formulated clearly and be unified and practiced by all units constituting our defense forces."	 	
 ARL_Foundations_For_The_Bureaucracy:0 "Foundations For The Bureaucracy"
 ARL_Foundations_For_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "It is one thing to defeat chaos and disorder militarily; it is another to dispel it for good. A modern bureaucracy must be established. Ministries to plan our industries, to administer our military, to tend to our agricultural sector, all must be built from the ground up and staffed by competent administrators. We can launch small pilot projects in various fields to develop institutional expertise. Whoever happens to be good at managing our formerly ad hoc economy and military can train the new bureaucrats.\n\nRight now the tasks and responsibilities of our new ministries are small. But as new land is incorporated to Kazakhstan's national renewal, and as new citizens join our grand project, our bureaucracy will stand ready for anything."
 ARL_Principle_Of_Discipline:0 "Principle Of Discipline"
 ARL_Principle_Of_Discipline_desc:0 "What makes a nation truly great? The great thinkers of the National Renewal party have singled out discipline as the most estimable quality a nation can have. The discipline to diligently work the fields to feed one's people; the discipline to fight valiantly for one's country; the discipline to obey one's leaders across difficult times.\n\nThe Germans provide us with a perfect counter-example as their decadent empire crumbles to ruins. The Kazakh people must be spared such a pitiful fate! Under the banner of National Renewal, our civilians and soldiers must learn how to grow their inner strength if they are to weather the coming struggle. And in turn, we must transform the National Renewal Party into a powerful teacher, one able to teach all Kazakh the iron discipline they require."
 ARL_Principle_Of_Pragmatism:0 "Principle Of Pragmatism"
 ARL_Principle_Of_Pragmatism_desc:0 "If discipline is the king of all virtues a nation can hold, then pragmatism is its queen. A sublime principle, pragmatism give the wisdom necessary to pick the best path. It tempers the steel of discipline to make it flexible instead of brittle.\n\nLet others be shackled to ideas and principles. The only guiding light the Kazakh nation needs is pragmatism. We must be free to take the best from capitalism, socialism or fascism to defend our future. The true National Renewal Thought is protean, adaptable, resilient. It supersedes all other obsolete forms of thinking and integrates the best aspect of every society to lead Kazakhstan to its rightful place."
 ARL_Theoretical_Preparations:0 "Theoretical Preparations"
 ARL_Theoretical_Preparations_desc:0 "Our doctrines have been determined, and our soldiers' training has been standardized. We can now fuse our growing supply of capable soldiers with our growing ability to plan large scale deployments. Our defensive strategy on the border can be improved, turning the current mess of loosely organized outposts into a chain of strong points and fall back positions able to trip up any invader. Organizing regular patrols on disputed borders will give us a place to bloody our recruits and give them a taste of field operations. And carefully organized offensive plans can be drawn up to give us a way to react to a variety of military situations, from two front wars to all out combined arms invasions. All this theoretical preparation will pay dividend in future conflicts."
 ARL_Civilian_Sphere_Ready:0 "The Civilians Are Ready"
 ARL_Civilian_Sphere_Ready_desc:0 "Our civilian population has worked hard to learn the principles of National Renewal Thought. Now they stand ready to adopt our ideology in every aspect of their life. They understand themselves not as a soft population of potential victims, but as important cogs of a new Kazakh society. The economy enters a new symbiosis with the army; they keep the army fed, supplied, organized. Our civilians can now bring productivity to liberated areas of Kazakhstan, confirming the gains of our soldiers. Just as every soldier knows his position in the hierarchy, so do civilian workers. And now all of Aktobe await the opportunity to see our nation renewed."
 	 	 	 	
 ARL_The_Leading_Principle:0 "The Leading Principle"
 ARL_The_Leading_Principle_desc:0 "The pragmatism to adapt to any situation and the discipline to endure it. These two important principles of National Renewal Thought reflect the leading principle: unity. Civilians united to soldiers, members of the National Renewal Party united to a single goal. One nation, united in purpose and methods. Kazakhstan is defined by National Renewal Thought, and it in turn molds it. Imperfect men and women try to express the greatness of the Kazakh nation by living out the principles of National Renewal Thought in their daily life. We must leave to the party's great thinkers the delicate task of refining ever further National Renewal thought; all that we need for now is its leading principle of unity as we prepare for the future."
 ARL_Military_Sphere_Ready:0 "The Troops Are Ready"
 ARL_Military_Sphere_Ready_desc:0 "Across bomb shelters and military bases our men swarm with a new purpose. Gone is the apathy that swept the Kazakh nations after the dying throes of the Soviet Union, or the slow despair of the German imposed anarchy. Our soldiers train. They clean their weapons. They revise battle plans with their officers. Once the accursed German bombers finally stop hindering us, our soldiers will march out into the steppes and reclaim the glory of the great Kazakh nation. Until then, they stand at their posts, ready for Kazakhstan to begin anew."
 ARL_Steel_Ourselves:0 "Steel Ourselves"
 ARL_Steel_Ourselves_desc:0 "Our preparations are mostly complete, leaving us free to wait. The interminable German bombing campaign continues on. But in the west, rumors abound of a faltering Reich. As the fuhrer's life wanes, so too might the bombing campaign? Until then we sit in our bunkers. We are ready. The National Renewal is coming."
 ARL_The_Bombings_Have_Ended:0 "The Bombings Have Ended!"
 ARL_The_Bombings_Have_Ended_desc:0 "As the bombing became routine, the German's sorties began to be used as a way to mark the passing of time. But today's clocks remain frozen, as the warplanes have failed to make their appearance. A temporary lull? Or the beginning of something greater? We've got good reasons to suspect that the bombing campaign has ended for good."
 ARL_The_Moment_Is_Upon_Us:0 "The Moment Is Upon Us!"
 ARL_The_Moment_Is_Upon_Us_desc:0 "Now's the day, and now's the hour! The German bastards have turned their warplanes on themselves, and the Kazakh eagle is free to soar above the plains once more! Aktobe's soldiers can begin moving to their forward positions while our civilians begin the long process of rebuilding our industry. Bureaucrats have set out into the countryside to implement the National Renewal Party's land reforms.\n\nOur plans might encounter teething problems, but having a proper strategy and clear objectives will help us in the long run. Kazakhstan will be reunited!"
 	 	 	 	
 ARL_Protocol_Countryside:0 "Start The Rural Protocols"
 ARL_Protocol_Countryside_desc:0 "Our planned reforms of the agricultural sector can now begin! The peasants' ramshackle huts can be turned into proper houses, their poorly attended fields plowed anew. Food can be grown to food our population's bellies. As food stocks get established cash crops can be grown to earn our state money from the endless plains. Giving help to the peasants will convince even the most skeptical about the goodness of National Renewal Thought, and of Chairman Onoprienko's vision for Kazakhstan. The workers in the field are as crucial as the workers in the city for the health of our nation!"
 ARL_Protocol_Administration:0 "Start The Administrative Protocols"
 ARL_Protocol_Administration_desc:0 "A strong state is a force multiplier for a nation's efforts. With the help of our burgeoning ministries we can now begins our plans for the post-bombing era. An extensive census of our population can be undertaken to improve our knowledge of our state's economy. Proper resources can be allocated to critical projects. The workforce can be marshaled to repair our cities and infrastructure. In every city and villages of Aktobe men and women of all ages flock to their work under the watchful eye of our administrators."
 ARL_Protocol_Military:0 "Start The Military Protocols"
 ARL_Protocol_Military_desc:0 "Our soldiers and officers have been drilled for this situation, and now it's show-time! Initial operations can begin as our men defend our frontiers and prepare for further conflicts. In military bases our military administrators carefully give hardworking military men their salary. Logistics officer strike out into our agricultural centers to arrange regular supply of food. Old soviet factories are repaired and reactivated, veritable cornucopias of weapons and ammunition. Our military administration stands ready in its role as the backbone of our army."
 ARL_Start_The_Survey:0 "Start The Survey"
 ARL_Start_The_Survey_desc:0 "Just what is out there, anyhow? The National Renewal party as no doubt that Kazakhstan is a strong nation with bountiful land. However there is nothing wrong with getting to know our land's bounty a little better.\n\nAs rehearsed, bureaucrats are escorted by soldiers as they venture out on the plain, assessing all that still stand after the German bombing campaign. Agricultural estates, mines, gas fields and other such resources are provided by our motherland to help the Kazakh people. We must make full use of this gift."
 ARL_Establishing_Control:0 "Establishing Control"
 ARL_Establishing_Control_desc:0 "While the exact border of every warlord of the Soviet Union varies from time to time, our state has de facto rule over a good amount of territory north of the Aral sea. In practice, this control means very little as during the bombing campaign we could barely maintain a network of cities and military bases. Connecting these areas of control were roads plagued by bandits and vast expanses of unreachable villages.\n\nNow that the bombings have stopped our soldiers march on, breaking up bandit operations and establishing secure paths into every area of Aktobe. Villages that could once plausibly ignore our orders are being brought into the fold as our control over the region is firmly established."
 ARL_Urban_Administration:0 "The Urban Administration"
 ARL_Urban_Administration_desc:0 "Our fledgling administration has encountered a few problems in our more populated city where the complexity of urban economic life has not meshed one hundred percents with our plans. New offices led by bureaucrats of the National Renewal Party are being established in every city to help tend to the needs of of city dwellers. These offices are tasked with providing everyone with adequate living quarters and jobs. They can also continue the political education of those with a weaker understanding of National Renewal Thought."
 ARL_Rural_Administration:0 "The Rural Administration"
 ARL_Rural_Administration_desc:0 "Urban administration bureaus have proven a surprisingly useful structure. Their small size has allowed them a surprising nimbleness to deal with local problems. As a result public (and private) satisfaction with our regime has grown among urban citizens.\n\nDistant areas of the countryside would benefit from an improved rural administration. By using local knowledge of local problem to funnel national resources we can improve productivity in the countryside. New rural bureaus will also form a good basis for our burgeoning ministry of Rural Affairs. Soon even the most distant villages will be free to enjoy the benefits of a strong and organized state. As our peasants march to well tended fields and tidy villages, they will learn to love the greatness of National Renewal Thought."
 ARL_Military_Administration:0 "The Military Administration"
 ARL_Military_Administration_desc:0 "Our efforts in developing organization skills among our officer corps has had great results, as soldiers no longer run out of ammunition and food. While the grunts get used to the novelty of being paid on time every week, the highers up are beginning to ponder what the next step in administrative reform should be. A more centralized and permanent bureau of military affairs would allow our best logistics and support officers to use their talents full time. To these men can be added our recruiters, propagandist and every other type of specialist a modern army needs to function well. By multiplying the work that can be done by a single officers, other trained soldiers can be freed up for new purposes out on the field."
 ARL_To_The_Borders:0 "To The Borders!"
 ARL_To_The_Borders_desc:0 "Without the threat of German bombs our men are free to stretch their legs! Training exercises no longer take place on military base and in the shade of bomb shelters. No, our men now train on the border in newly expanded outposts. Keeping a higher number of troops on the border helps us secure it from rivals, and gets our men familiar with the staging points of our future wars of conquest.\n\nAs they complete endless weapon drills, our men look beyond the border and into the steppe. War and glory await them!"
 ARL_Seeds_Of_The_Armament_Industry:0 "Seeds Of The Armament Industry"
 ARL_Seeds_Of_The_Armament_Industry_desc:0 "If we're to soar like eagles, we must first stop scurrying like rats in the supplies of previous generations.\n\nOur soldiers need new guns, and they need ammunition for them. They need equipment and they need regular supplies. We are reaching the logistical limit of what can be scavenged or obtained through small scale workshops. It is thus becoming important to open new factories, guided by our military's need. In the long term a solid military industrial complex will allow us to do fancy things such as mechanizing our army and even building deterrents against the return of German planes."
 ARL_Open_The_Mines:0 "Open The Mines"
 ARL_Open_The_Mines_desc:0 "Our industrial projects require crucial metals. Iron. Chromium. Gold. Copper. Tungsten. As long as trade outside of the devastated Russian and Kazakhstan land remains impossible, any resources we need must be found by ourselves.\n\nPromising sites have been found for new mines, relying on local information and partial Soviet and Imperial era surveys. While we may lack modern mining techniques for the moment, we're not short on elbow grease and pickaxes. Time to strike the earth!"
 ARL_Talks_With_The_Herdsmen:0 "Talks With The Herdsmen"
 ARL_Talks_With_The_Herdsmen_desc:0 "Herdsmen floating across the Kazakh sea of grass don't really square well with our project for a strong, centralized state. Every peasant, citizen and soldier has his or her own village, city or barrack. But the herdsman have no fixed abode, and look warily at our projects.\n\nThis doesn't mean that they are a total write-off. The animals they raise form an important sector of our agricultural economy, as they make use of arid land where little grows. These rough men of the plain would provide formidable soldiers if convinced. Negotiating with these prideful and stubborn citizens will take some time, but we our pragmatism mirrors theirs. Perhaps a diplomatic arrangement is possible?"
 ARL_The_First_Batches:0 "The First Batches"
 ARL_The_First_Batches_desc:0 "The first batches of transformed resources are being churned by our factories! Of particular interest is the beginning of our steel smelting operations. Using our bountiful chromium supply to make stainless steel will provide a great deal of material for industrial use... If we can make it work.\n\nExamining the quality and yield of our resource transformation operations is critical to the long term success of our projects. By finding where we can improve we can design more efficient mines and factories!"
 ARL_A_New_Civil_Service:0 "A New Civil Service"
 ARL_A_New_Civil_Service_desc:0 "The Kazakhstan we desire to build is one where all that work hard are welcome. By giving jobs in the military and administration to all that ask we can tap in the vast quantity of people in our borders and beyond that struggle to make a living. In turn these grateful newcomers will swell the ranks of our army and government and aid the national renewal of Kazakhstan.\n\nService guarantees Aktobe citizenship, would anyone like to learn more?"
 ARL_Secure_The_Borders:0 "Secure The Borders"
 ARL_Secure_The_Borders_desc:0 "It's one thing to now have permanent military deployments on our border, but quite another to keep them safe from any eventuality. By beginning our program of border fortifications we can deter any 'bandit' that might try to penetrate our border. There is no time to listen to our neighbor's complaints that these are obvious staging points for future invasions.\n\nOur extant border garrisons can be reinforced. Network of trenches can be dug to slow down anyone approaching without tanks or mechanized infantry. A secondary line of supply depots and garrison can host our reserves to reinforce any area under attack. In time the only way to cross our borders will be if we allow it."
 ARL_Lay_Of_The_Land:0 "Lay Of The Land"
 ARL_Lay_Of_The_Land_desc:0 "New garrisons and outposts need to be installed to complete our defensive net. By placing artillery kill fields over predicted invasion routes we can increase the cost of any breakthrough attempt. Permanent observers in forward outposts can serve as tripwire to any invasion. Long range recon patrol will familiarize our defenders with the lay of the land, helping them build new defensive works. In time a great wall of defensive position will stretch across the steppe, manned by men ready for any eventuality. Soldiers brought up from the interior will find a new home on our border regions."

Bandits in the outside world have given up on cracking our defenses while those inside our borders have either died or changed career path. A new nation rises, one where law abiding citizens have nothing to fear!"

 ARL_Arming_Our_Men_desc:0 "Now that we have military factories, we can equip our men!\n\nOur previous groundwork in organizing our units and keeping precise records of what each men was missing can now guide us as we distribute guns, boots, ammunition, helmets and other pieces of kit to our men. Once those with no weapons are armed, we can then begin standardizing equipment along the rest of our men. Old soviet or imperial era rifles can be ditched for new weapons. In time our convoluted supply chain of trader, scavengers and old soviet arms cache will be streamlined to simply delivering new weapons from our factories to our men."
 ARL_Looking_Outwards_desc:0 "Our internal affairs are now in order. But this is only the beginning of our national renewal. What good is a newly weaponized state if it is not used for conquest and unification?\n\nThe thugs, fanatics, soviet has-beens and amateur politicians occupying the rest of Kazakhstan are no match for Aktobe. In time all must bend to the National Renewal Party and its chairman. A land long united might become divided, but it's certain that long divided Kazakhstan must be united!"
 ARL_Intensify_Border_Patrols:0 "Intensify Border Patrols"
 ARL_Intensify_Border_Patrols_desc:0 "Border patrols have become an important part of our border garrison's defensive toolkit. They help train our soldiers in field deployments; they gain us crucial information on the state of our border defense; they give our men a better understanding of the no man's land between our positions and the enemy's.\n\nWe can now increase the frequency of border patrols, and shift their emphasis to probing the enemy positions. By finding where our enemies are less prepared we can update our war plans. The border regions will be the best fortified and most savagely defended, and so any edge we can gain to crack the frontiers will be terribly important."
 ARL_Desert_Training:0 "Desert Warfare Training"
 ARL_Desert_Training_desc:0 "Kazakhstan is arid, and where the dry steppe ends desert begins. Fighting in these areas requires a specific skill-set: the heat and water scarcity tire men; the lack of resources make supply lines critical; the vast open expanses make it difficult to surprise the enemy. As our wars of unification progress we will eventually need to invade the deserts of southern and eastern Kazakhstan.\n\nIt's thus important to prepare adequately. Within our borders and east of the Aral sea stretches our own piece of the southern desert. This will be a perfect spot to train troops for desert operations. Afterwards our men can go for a swim in the Aral sea to cool off and rid themselves of the desert's dust."
 ARL_Mobility_And_Discipline:0 "Mobility And Discipline"
 ARL_Mobility_And_Discipline_desc:0 "There is a lot of ground to cover across the steppes and deserts of Kazakhstan. Whether on the offensive or defensive, our men must be able to go where needed to reinforce their comrades. Being able to reinforce faltering defensive positions allows us to repel enemy assaults and preserve mastery over strategic strong points. Being able to concentrate troops where the enemy defenses are weakest allow us to tip the balance and achieve breakthrough.\n\nThis mobility requires proper supply of our cavalry and motorized units. Long distance stresses men, horses and materiel to the breaking point. By maintaining all components of our mobile forces in top shape we give them the tools to perform; by strengthening discipline we ensure our men are still capable of fighting after moving dozens of kilometers in a day."

As a result our generals are convening in our capital to discuss our next moves.\n\nWhile we have drafted war plans for a great variety of scenarios, some debate remains about what our first moves should be. While chairman Onoprienko is legally only the first military officer among many, his growing influence has made him quite an asset in any coalition of generals. Thus, many officers are courting the chairman for his approval of their proposed strategy."

 ARL_The_Islamists_desc:0 "Banditry has long been a scourge across the former Soviet Union, but not all solutions to this problems are proving workable. To the north east the former bandit turned holy man Nikolai Zabelkin has successfully crushed all bandits under his boot. However his campaign against all Kazakh that displease Allah will inevitably result in a collision with our own desire to unify Kazakhstan.\n\nZabelkin's land is amongst the most fertile in Kazakhstan, and getting rids of his fanatics is essential to our long term goals.

The "Kazakh Dawn Blueshirts", as they prefer to fancy themselves, are slavishly obedient to their demagogic and buffoonish warlord Gazizov, who inspires them to wage terror on the civilian population and set off the peoples of Kazakhstan against each other. Such zealous and brutish sort of scum can't be compromised. The only way to deal with the state in Aktau is to completely eliminate the Fascist leadership and its followers and liberate the city from the reign of darkness."

 ARL_Fortifying_The_East_desc:0 "To our east in Kyzylorda lies a particularly big part of the rotting corpse of the Soviet Union. Under General Momyshuly, the Kazakh Red Army Remnants clings to the dream of a communist revival across all of the former Russian Empire. This has thankfully alienated them from all other Kazakh factions, surrounding them with enemies. Yet these lunatics remain dangerous. Their hold over one of the last armored division in the former Soviet Union might allow them to break through our forts and trenches.\n\nA new fortification effort on our border with the Red Army Remnants has been launched, with a particular eye for anti tank measures. While we do not have the material necessary to crush their obsolete tanks right now, this fortified border will hurt any Soviet attempt to invade us. We will deal with this communist threat later, when the time is right."

 ARL_A_Deal_With_The_Poles_desc:0 "The Polish squatters in so-called Nowa Polska are just another problem in a long list of obstacles to Kazakhstan's renewal. But the Poles are different from our other regional rivals. Their long term goal is not one of expansion, but mere survival. We can attempt to reach a deal with them for the time being: as long as they don't bother our western border we will in turn leave them alone. Any deal reached with these foreigners will have to be renegotiated once our grasp of the rest of Kazakhstan is secure. Of course, our military planners have predicted that this grace period for the Poles will not be long enough to let them increase their long term survival chances in the region as an independent state."

The wars against our first rivals have unfortunately undone much of the previous government's anti-bandit efforts. By restoring order and safety we will ingratiate ourselves with the population. Our bureaucrats are already hard at work integrating local economic activity into our various ministries. And of course, teachers of National Renewal Thought are working hard to erase the unfortunate spread of fascism, communism, capitalism and islamism across our new land.\n\nIn time our new citizens will understand the greatness of National Renewal Thought."

Just as the fall of the Soviet Union and the great Western Russian war of the 50s has shaped our initial strategy and reform of our military, so our first wars of unification inform the future of our army. Small units tactics, large scale deployment of our infantry, unsuspected problems with our equipment and counter insurgency strategies are all topics we learned much about in the forest steppes, deserts and cities.\n\nExtensive debriefings of soldiers and officers are being undertaken to compile data for future use."

We've eliminated the first obstacles in our unification of Kazakhstan, but the path ahead remains long. Rumblings of a new Khan , of a democratic Kazakhstan or even of a return of the accursed Soviet Union abound on the horizon.\n\nOur soldiers must reach their new forward positions and wait for further instructions. In this effort they'll be joined by new comrades from our new territories."

 ARL_The_False_Khan_desc:0 "The Russian and Kazakh Anarchy have produced their fair share of madmen. Crazed by the annihilation of their homeland, many have turned to an imagined past or an impossible future as a coping mechanism. In the north of Kazakhstan former Soviet commander Abu Dusukhambetov has renamed himself Abu Khan and claims to be the true warchief of the Kazakh steppe and a worthy heir to the Khans of old.\n\nThe false Khan can threaten us all he wants; his dream of a new era of conquest will soon die in its crib when our soldiers march on Kokshetau and dispel his idiocy once and for all."

But unlike our own National Renewal Party, this movement seeks to emulate the soft democracies of the western world.\n\nThere is something to be said for these men's rationality. Unlike the string of mad khans, muslim fanatics and wannabe fascists we've encountered the men of Pavlodar can be reasoned with. Since their puny army is not a threat to us, a majority of the High Command has settled behind the idea of offering them a non aggression pact. We can deal with them later once our biggest rivals are gone."

Even losing a second time in the quixotic war of the 50s, all across the former Soviet Union remnants of the Red Army bide their time for a new attempt to resurrect the Soviet Union. We must now deal with our own set of remnants.\n\nThis final enemy in our unification of Kazakhstan will be the toughest yet. Veteran troops that have carefully maintained their decaying tanks and vehicles now stand across our positions throughout the Kazakh lands. Breaking the will of the men who fought through the Russian apocalypse will be difficult. But the national renewal of Kazakhstan must succeed!\n\nMen, to battle!"

Now that the situation has changed, we must revisit our arrangement with these foreigners. Good thing that we are a pragmatic lot.\n\nIt is true that the Poles have had a rotten deal from the infernal Germans. If they prove willing to join our unification and end their oppression of Kazakh citizens there is no reason why the Poles could not flourish in our country. History has seen a great many people meet across the steppes and work together. There is no reason for the leaders of Nowa Polska to refuse to help us in our efforts to build something greater."

Already the world has taken notice that the Kazakh people have claimed a new destiny. In time all will stand in awe of what we've accomplished."
