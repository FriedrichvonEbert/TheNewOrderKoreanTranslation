 ime.1.t:0 "The Governorate of the Levant"
 ime.1.d:0 "The grand dreams of colonialism and an imperial Italy seemed so close to becoming reality. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the tricolour waved over the defeated British forts, as the victorious Regio Esercito advanced in the Middle East - after Egypt, Palestine soon fell, as the British lion bled under the talons of the Italian eagle. When Italian troops entered Jerusalem, Rome's propaganda took no time to paint the triumph as the mighty echo of an ancient past - the glorious legions, that had once brought order and peace to Judea under Vespasian and Trajan, have now returned to Palestine led by Benito Mussolini, the Caesar of our age.\n\nOf course, reality was much different, and its taste much more bitter. Native resistance to Italian occupation was strong, and the more the Italian Empire spread far and wide on the map, the more its forces were stretched thin on the ground. Fascist plans to turn the Levant into a loyal and Italian province of the Empire by assimilating the natives were soon canned, as opposition to Italy was one of the few things capable of uniting the various ethnic, religious and cultural groups in the region. Projects to resettle the Levant with Italians never left the drawing board, as the people of the peninsula preferred the much safer lands of the Fourth Shore, and after years of endless cycles of revolt and repression, the new Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, in his bid to resolve the many ailments of the Empire, finally decided that a new course of action was necessary.\n\nEnter Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa. In the Duce's eyes, the young general of the Carabinieri had three characteristics that made him especially fit for the position of governor - efficiency, demonstrated in his relatively short but dashing career, lack of sympathy for fascist rhetoric, and most of all, a complete lack of involvement or interest in politics. Since the beginning of Dalla Chiesa's tenure, a semblance of order returned to the Levant - with the new governor agreeing to allow autonomy and a moderate level of freedom to those who were content with that, and focusing the efforts of his garrison on the more radical paramilitaries and resistance groups. An uneasy peace was built in the Levant - a fickle, fragile truce, built to protect the many innocent civilians of the region, whatever their religion or ethnicity, from the horrors of what could very well be an endless, subterranean war."
 ime.1.a:0 "And yet, peace can't last."
 
 ime.2.t:0 "A Letter From Karameh"
 ime.2.d:0 "Riservatissimo - For the Governor's Eyes Only\n\nTo Governor Dalla Chiesa in Jerusalem, From the regional Carabinieri command in Karameh.\n\nWe would like to report to Your Excellency that the construction of the new headquarters of Fatah in the town of Karameh has been completed, and the current leader of the organization Arafat Yasser has taken residence in the structure. As per Your Excellency's orders, a Carabinieri garrison was situated in the vicinities of the village, and the bridge over the river Jordan that connects the location to the West Bank is kept under watch for any unauthorized movements. The offer of emir Hussein of garrisoning the bridge with soldiers from his own armed forces has been kindly declined.\n\nThe loyalty of the emir of Transjordan is still questionable at best, and he is still one of the main providers of funding for Fatah. However, we do not believe that any direct threats are coming from his court in Amman, as the main source of Hussein's wealth is the oil deals between Transjordan and ENI - which of course, would become null and void should he break the treaties that bind him to us. At any rate, any move against the emir would surely provoke a widespread insurrection, as he enjoys widespread popularity among his subjects in Transjordan and many conservative Arabs in Palestine. Interestingly, Hussein's alliance with Arafat doesn't seem to be exactly comfortable - the two have little in common, besides a somewhat shared goal of more independence from Italy.\n\nRegarding Arafat himself, we still recommend keeping him under close watch. Despite his young age, he enjoys immense popularity among the Arab youths in the West Bank, and while it is true that allowing Fatah to maintain her own paramilitaries was a necessary evil, they still represent a threat - especially considering that Arafat has consistently refused to back down from his requests for full independence and native rule. Still, we believe that for now breaking the truce would be against Arafat's own interests, as fortunately he places the well being of his own people over mad quests for vengeance - and he too fears the consequences that hostilities would inevitably bring, should they resume. In conclusion, while the current situation is far from ideal and will inevitably deteriorate in time, we would strongly advise against any offensive move against either Arafat or Hussein. The most appropriate course of actions would be to continue the negotiations and buy for time, until hopefully Rome realizes the untenability of our situation in the long term."
 ime.2.a:0 "Keep Amman and Karameh under close watch, but do nothing else for now."
 
 ime.3.t:0 "The Defense"
 ime.3.d:0 "The armored cars made their way along a dirt road, proceeding straight as a ruler along grain fields. Farmers in dirty clothes toiled the arid earth, as the scorching sun burned their skins, as the kibbutz came closer and closer into view. From the desert, life - fields, farms, animals, a small town, palm trees and flowers, defiant against the surrounding sand and rocks. Up above, the Italian flag flew in the wind, and right next to it, on a pole just as tall, the blue and white flag with the Star of David. When governor Dalla Chiesa stood up and left the car, a small band of soldiers stood to salute him - their uniforms kept impeccably, their weapons old but polished to a shine, despite having been just used in training. The local detachment of Haganah.\n\nThe kibbutz was ordinary, no different than all the others Dalla Chiesa had inspected in the past, all mostly concentrated around the areas where Jewish settlement was more prominent - around Tel Aviv and Haifa, and to the north near lake Tiberias. A town hall, a school with a playground in which children chased each other and kicked a ball around laughing and shouting, a small synagogue, rows and rows of small, clean and orderly houses. People of all ages walked around the streets of the village, busy in their daily mansions - kids, the first generation native to the kibbutz, young men growing strong and healthy by working in farms and shops, and smiling elderly people, hiding in their memories the horrors they had witnessed in the past. And around the village, watchtowers, barbed wire, and armed Haganah soldiers stood and watched, guns at the ready.\n\nWhen the Italian Empire began to allow Jewish refugees from the Reich in the Levant, accepting the existence of Haganah was a necessary, even if unspoken, part of that deal. After all, having a single self defense organization dedicated to protecting and policing the kibbutzim was a better solution for both the Jews and the Italians, especially considering the Haganah's self imposed policy of havlaga, or self-restraint - in other words, the Haganah never attacked, but only defended. The people of the kibbutzim, especially the elderly, had known what it meant to be defenseless in the face of horror - now, in their new home in the Levant, they would never be without a defense again."
 ime.3.a:0 "Order military patrols to steer clear of the kibbutzim in this region - no need to provoke tensions."
 
 ime.4.t:0 "The Battle of Latrun"
 ime.4.d:0 "Truck tracks, footprints, blood. Italian soldiers running around, rifles in their hands, with officers shouting orders. Women crying in the streets, boys shouting insults and spitting on the ground while a soldier searches them and another one points a rifle at their backs. One tries to make a run for it, a burly Regio Esercito soldiers knocks him unconscious with the butt of his rifle, and two of his teeth fly away from his mouth. And in the middle of the chaos, the shouting, the crying, one man stands still, staring at the still warm corpses, covered with a white blanket - governor Dalla Chiesa.\n\nNobody knows yet how the Irgun commando managed to reach the village of Latrun, so far into Arab territory. The Carabinieri are still busy analyzing the scene, interrogating witnesses, examining corpses. They were a few dozens, and surrounded the town at night, attacking at dawn. For Irgun, Latrun has a symbolic meaning, as it sits on the only road connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem - but otherwise, it's only one of many tiny Arab villages scattered around Palestine. Perhaps this is why Irgun expected no resistance - their commando, numbering a few dozens, planned to attack at dawn, sweeping into the village, and causing mayhem before the Italians or anyone else had time to react. Instead, what they found was a sleeper cell of the ANM, which had set up shop long ago in Latrun.\n\nThe battle broke out immediately, and devolved into house by house fighting when Irgun units managed to enter the village. Gunfire was heard for hours, before the closest Italian division was able to encircle Latrun and mop up the remnants of the Irgun commando and the ANM fedayeen. Numerous civilians lost their lives in the short but violent battle, but among both Irgun and ANM soldiers, casualties were extremely high, and Italian troops even managed to take prisoners from both sides - a rather rare occurrence. Ironically, a tragedy such as this proved itself helpful. Dalla Chiesa turned away, and looked at the soldiers surrounding him. Something had to be done."
 ime.4.a:0 "Take care of the wounded civilians and set up a defensive perimeter. New orders will arrive shortly."
 
 ime.5.t:0 "Scopi e Metodi dell'Irgun Zvaì Leumi B'Eretz-Israel"
 ime.5.d:0 ""As you know, Irgun, officially known as National Military Organization in the Land of Israel, is a clandestine paramilitary and terrorist movement operating in the entirety of the Levant. It was founded in 1931, from a small core of hardline Zionists, and it expanded slowly, absorbing smaller Zionist groups. Their ideology can be summed up in three points: first, every Jew has the right to enter Palestine; second, only active retaliation can stop the Arabs from encroaching on rightful Jewish land; third, only Jewish armed force can ensure a Jewish state. Their goal is simple - to turn the entirety of the Levant into a Jewish state.\n\nThey don't claim just Palestine, either - their aims include Transjordan as well. They're not afraid to extensively use violence against both Italian soldiers and Arab civilians. Their organization is rigid, with a well organized military hierarchy, and especially shadowy - they have contacts in many kibbutzim, Jewish communities and Haganah units scattered around the Levant, and every single Jew in the Governorate could potentially be a member or supporter of Irgun. While we do know the names of some of Irgun's major leaders, including their commander Menachem Begin, we have little actual information that would allow us to strike them precisely. They are a dangerous enemy, hiding behind every corner and every stone, and they will not hesitate to pull the trigger if they have you in your sights."\n\nDalla Chiesa stopped, and the Carabinieri generals and officers gathered in the room stood silent. Maps, diagrams, charts and photographs were hung on the walls and scattered on the table of the dimly lit room, as cigarette smoke filled the air. "Of course, a traditional counter insurgency campaign would be a disaster. There is no way to tell apart an Irgun affiliate with any average Haganah soldier or even any ordinary Jew - it would result in a massacre, and would break any good will existing between us and Haganah, eventually increasing Irgun's popularity among the Jews. A new tactic has to be employed.""
 ime.5.a:0 "Dismissed."
 
 ime.6.t:0 "Rapporto sull'Harakat al-Qawimin al-Arab"
 ime.6.d:0 "Riservatissimo - For the Governor's eyes only\n\nTo Governor Dalla Chiesa, Jerusalem From the regional Carabinieri command in Latrun.\n\nWe would like to report to Your Excellency that the interrogations of captives taken in following the events in Latrun has provided us with valuable information about the nature of the armed Palestinian resistance movements. After extensive application of persuasive interrogation methods, we have managed to learn that despite acting under a single name, the fedayeen fighting for the Harakiyyin have actually no idea about the overall operational status, tactical plans or even composition of ANM units different from their own.\n\nThis has led us to conclude that the ANM is organized in a loose and decentralized network of cells, each acting on their own and largely independent from one another. The chairman of the ANM, George Habash, is currently suspected to be hiding somewhere in the Lebanese highlands, and doesn't seem have to have much control over the organization. While nominally a communist movement, the ideological purity of the ANM seems shaky at best - when interrogated on the topic, the Latrun captives demonstrated only an extremely cursory knowledge of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and other classics of communist thought, and seemed to be motivated above all else by Arab nationalist, anti-Italian and anti-Zionist rhetoric.\n\nWe are led to believe that the ANM is in fact not a single movement, but a loose coalition of numerous pre-existing cells and organizations, united by their opposition to Italian rule and a decentralized chain of command. While apparently a weakness, this characteristic is also the ANM's greatest strength - such a movement is effectively impossible to decapitate, and focusing on eliminating one cell will do nothing against the organization at large, as its other parts can continue operating autonomously. We were not able to effectively confirm or deny the existence of ties between ANM cells and Fatah. The Latrun captives have been hospitalized following the interrogation, and will be transferred to the closest internment camp after they recover."
 ime.6.a:0 "File this report in the archives."
 
 ime.7.t:0 "Operation Masada"
 ime.7.d:0 "Dalla Chiesa drank the last sip of coffee, by now disgustingly lukewarm, and put the cup back on the desk. Scattered on his desk, piles of documents, reports, interrogation logs, photographs, maps, all marked with coffee stains and pen markings and annotations. In this kibbutz near Haifa, there might be an Irgun commander disguised as a Haganah sergeant - this remote village in Transjordan could be the location of an ANM hidden arsenal - and at least a dozen different dots on the map of Palestine could be the location of the next Latrun massacre.\n\nThere are many in the Levant who hate Italy and everything it stands for, but those who are willing to pick up arms fueled by that hate, usually hate someone else even more. Divide et impera, the Romans said - and no place is more divided than the Italian Levant. There is only one way to deal with ANM and Irgun, and that is making them deal with each other - while at the same time making sure that the thin line protecting the civilians from the chaos is always occupied by an Italian soldier. The people of the Levant will learn that we are the only hope for peace in the country, and if that they'll have to work with us if they hope to bring an end to the bloodshed - and God knows, these lands, these people, have already seen too much blood.\n\nThe governor gathered the necessary documents into one large envelope. In it was a plan to ensure that the garrison could keep the Levant under control without excessive costs in money or lives, just for a few more years. Many in Rome wouldn't like it, and perhaps the goons in the PNF should be left unaware of the finer details. After all, Ciano would surely understand - this is for the greater good of Italy. Dalla Chiesa closed the envelope, and looked once again at the letters printed on the outside.\n\nOperation Masada."

 ime_operation_masada_unlock:0 "Operation Masada Decisions Unlocked."
 
 ime.8.t:0 "Operations against Irgun - Success!" 
 ime.8.d:0 "Our recent attempts to provoke armed conflict between the forces of Irgun and the Harakiyyin appear to have been a resounding success. According to recent reports by the Carabinieri, fifty Irgun terrorists travelling along a stretch of desert in search of a supposed newly established village (the location - and existence - of which we have fabricated) found themselves ambushed in the early morning by an ANM raiding party, as planned. While the Irgun fighters retaliated with their characteristic fury, the ANM possessed better weapons - not to mention more time to plan. In the end, the Irgun fighters barely escaped, leaving twenty of their own behind to rot in the desert sand. \n \n Irgun's activity throughout the Levant has dropped drastically as they slink back to their dens to lick their wounds, leaving the Harakiyyin the stronger power - for now. George Habash has not made a public statement on the matter, although our spies in the ANM inform us he is growing more confident of victory by the day."

He was a young man, then, but even today he still remembered the first months of the occupation, the feverish hope that had gripped his family. Maybe the infamous hatred of his people by the Nazis were just rumors? Surely none could be so cruel?\n\nThe man knew better now. He remembered his first camp, too. The things he had seen had changed him over time, he also knew. When he had killed his first Nazi, he felt nothing. When he looted his first home, he had felt nothing. When they burned their first village, he felt nothing. But when he returned to Wilna, it was like a dam inside him burst - he had to leave. He had to find a new home - there was nothing left in Wilna but death and ash.\n\nHe had wandered for years through the wastes the Nazis had created. Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia, he had seen them all, seen their horrors, and seen what they had done to people. Still he pressed one. When he arrived in Italy, he dared not show his face. They said the Italians treated the Jews well - but they had also said that about the Nazis all those years ago. He wondered what he would find at his ultimate destination - more camps? More death? Perhaps he'd find more Kovners and Wilnas.\n\nWhen he stepped onto the Kibbutz, he did not know what he was looking at. The people seemed calm, happy, safe. He watched a child run to her mother, laughing. He turned his head again and saw a young man chatting nervously with a girl. He watched for a moment before he turned one last time - he saw an old man standing there, watching him.

Haganah is a self-defense militia dedicated to protecting Jewish settlements in Palestine, with Italy's approval, while Fatah is a larger Arab organization and paramilitary who has campaigned for the independence of the Levant as an independent Arab state. While both are somewhat willing to tolerate cooperation with the Italian government to pursue their own goals, they don't enjoy a great relationship between each other, and the uneasy peace that was reached between Italy, the Jews and the Arabs is constantly at risk of falling apart."

Among the Jews, those who were displeased by Haganah's moderation formed Irgun, a revisionist Zionist paramilitary group who fights for a Jewish state that spans the whole Levant, and isn't afraid to attack Italians and Arabs alike in their pursuit. Among the Arabs, the Harakiyyin, or ANM, was formed as a loose coalition of numerous communist, left wing nationalist and other groups, all campaigning for an independent Arab Levant, attacking both the Italian imperialists and their perceived Zionist puppets. Together, these groups have proved a major thorn in the side of the Italian government, and spread terror and fear among the population with their attacks on Italian soldiers and civilians alike."

In more recent times, emir Hussein has become a supporter of Fatah, especially of its more traditionalist and moderate wing, and his deep pockets have become a major source of funding for the organization, drawing some concern from the Italians."

While the Italian government nominally controls the entire region, in truth it has been forced to compromise with a Jewish self-defense paramilitary, §MHaganah§!, led by Yitzhak Rabin, and with an Arab organization, §YFatah§!, composed of a leftist wing led by Yasser Arafat and of a moderate wing led by emir Hussein of Transjordan. Keeping these two groups friendly to Italy is a necessity to maintain a semblance of stability in the region, but there is another problem - the radicals on both the Arab and the Jewish side. §TIrgun§!, a Zionist and nationalist paramilitary led by Menachem Begin, and the §eHarakiyyin§!, a coalition of Arab nationalists and communists led by George Habash, are spreading violence and terror in the region, and if left unchecked, their bloodshed might cause increased radicalization among both Arabs and Jews.

 POLITICS_GG_CHIESA_DESC:0 "카를로 알베르토 달라 치에사 총독의 기상천외한 경력은 많은 사람들을 놀라게 합니다. 제2차 세계 대전의 훈장을 받은 베테랑인 달라 치에사는 카라비니에리 장군이었던 그의 아버지의 뒤를 따르기 위해 육군에서 카라비니에리로 자리를 옮겼습니다. 전쟁이 끝난 후, 그는 레반트에 있는 새로 획득한 영토로 배속되었고, 그는 그 지역을 괴롭혔던 다양한 테러리스트들과 준군사 집단을 조사하고 억압하는 과정에서 그의 기술과 용기를 보여주었습니다. 불순분자들의 체포에 체포가 잇따랐고, 그는 카라비니에리 내에서 빠르게 진급해 결국 갈레아초 치아노의 눈에 띄게 되었습니다.\n\n새로운 총독을 레반트에 임명할 때가 되었을 때, 신임 두체는 또 다른 늙은 파시스트를 선택하는 대신 젊은 장군을 후계자로 선택했습니다. 그는 파시즘성향이 거의 없다는 것이 잘 알려져 있었기 때문에, 그 선택은 논란의 여지가 있었습니다. 그의 짧은 재임 기간 동안 카라비니에리 장군은 비록 비정통적인 방법을 사용해야 했더라도, 레반트에 겉보기나마 평화로움을 가져다 주었습니다. 로마는 결과를 기대했고, 이것이 바로 달라 치에사가 그들에게 보여준 것입니다-극단주의 반군 단체들은 억압의 표적이 되었고, 반면에 협상할 용의가 있는 사람들은 휴전을 받아들였습니다. 하지만 레반트의 운명은 여전히 위태롭습니다.\n\n치에사는 이 지역에 대한 이탈리아의 통치는 오래가지 못할 것이라 믿고 있고, 이 지역이 다시 혼란에 빠지지 않는 한 이탈리아와 레반트의 많은 민족들 사이의 어떠한 형태의 합의가 이루어져야 한다고 여기고 있습니다. 카라비니에리 총독은 평화 비슷한 것을 레반트에 돌려주는데 성공했습니다. 그것이 얼마나 오래 지속될지는 아직 미지수입니다."
 
 POLITICS_Umberto_La_Rocca_DESC:0 "It's said that the destinies of people are decided in the very moment of their birth, and in the case of Umberto La Rocca, that might be true. Born in Port Said from an Italian father and a French mother, young Umberto soon became fluent in three languages, including Arabic - because of this, he was attached to Arab troops in World War Two, fighting with distinction as an officer in North Africa and the Levant against the British. After the war, La Rocca started a brilliant diplomatic career, being sent on missions all over Europe and even to the U.S., where he represented Italy and her nascent empire.\n\nAmbassador La Rocca returned to his homeland in recent times, tasked with yet another mission. For years, the Levant has been a hotbed of conflict, but since the Jerusalem Conference ended with the partition of the Governorate, a fragile new order has been set up in the region, and Jerusalem itself is at the centre of it. Established as a corpus separatum, Jerusalem is a neutral area, garrisoned by Italian troops and administered by a council of representatives of the many religious and ethnic communities which make up the population of the world's holiest city - and at the head of the council sits La Rocca, the impartial and neutral negotiator tasked with making sure that conflicts are defused, crises are resolved, and everyone gets to go home safely at night.\n\nNow, La Rocca knows that from him depends not only the future of Jerusalem as a safe haven for peace among the peoples, but also that of the Levant itself - for while both Palestine and Israel reluctantly accepted the establishment of the corpus separatum, the volatile nature of Levantine politics means that a threat may arise suddenly and with no warning. Only time will tell if the Holy City will be the keystone for building a lasting peace in the Levant, or the eye of a newly risen storm."
 
 POLITICS_Ahmed_Jibril_DESC:0 "Ahmed Jibril was never one for compromise. In his view, things in the Levant were simple, and plain for all to see. Palestine was inhabited by Arabs since ancient times - then, Western imperialists and their Zionist lackeys occupied the country, stole land, displaced inhabitants and claimed lives for the sake of their vile ambition and greed. The Palestinians wanted to resist, but alas, their leaders were grossly unfit to the task: cowards like Arafat, ready to sell his own country in exchange for empty promises of peace, puppets like Hussein, too content lining his pockets with lire to care about his homeland, and morons like Habash, too busy philosophizing to do anything useful.\n\nAnd so, the Palestinian Liberation Front - General Command was founded by Jibril and a small group of Palestinian fighters. Its goal - to liberate Palestine from the oppressor and the Jew. Its methods - anything and everything that could bring about its goal. The PLF-GC rapidly went from obscurity to becoming the most prominent Arab militia in the country, as many turned to the only group who was truly willing to fight for them. And wherever the PLF-GC went, terror, bloodshed and death soon followed - for no price was too great for the liberation of Palestine.\n\nNow, the Italians are gone, and Jibril and his men are finally in control of the country. And yet, their work is far from over. The Zionist snake still lurks, ready to spread its poison once again, and from all directions, threats are already emerging against the newly liberated Palestine. With any means necessary, Jibril and the PLF-GC intend to make sure that nobody can ever enslave Palestine and its Arab people ever again, and that the eternal Jew gets the payback it deserves for trying to steal what belongs to the Palestinians."
 
 POLITICS_Hussein_ibn_Talal_DESC:0 "Once, the name of Hussein bin Talal, scion of the Hashemites, was merely one among many others in the long list of native rulers, tribal chiefs and petty kings, vassals to Italy's vast empire, the prestige of his dynasty barely elevating him above the others. His father Talal had agreed to renew the treaty of protection with Italy that his own father Abdullah had signed, but in later years, Talal's severe mental illness made him completely unfit even for the role of a puppet, and it was so that the young prince Hussein became Emir of Transjordan.\n\nEver since then, Hussein worked vigorously to develop his fiefdom - always presenting himself as a staunch ally of Italy while secretly supporting the fedayeen, and closely working with ENI and other Italian businesses to exploit Transjordan's vast resources while pocketing a massive hoard of wealth. Still, the emir's apparent loyalty was rewarded by Rome, and Transjordan was given considerable autonomy inside the Levant, even being allowed its own army. The more Palestine descended into ethnic strife and open rebellion, the more Transjordan became closer to a model protectorate: stable, prosperous, and loyal.\n\nHussein used his wealth and connections to gain Italy's trust, and so it was not surprising that after Italian hegemony in the Middle East was reaffirmed following the Second Italo-Turkish War, Rome saw that only an Arab king could keep the region stable in the long run. Now, Hussein, newly crowned King of the Levant, is in control of a new, hopeful Arab nation: however, the future already casts dark shadows upon his reign. Between the emir's autocratic tendencies and rising Jewish resistance to the new Arab majority kingdom, Italy's gamble to rely on Hussein's loyalty may soon prove to be a grave mistake..."
 
 POLITICS_George_Habash_DESC:0 "George Habash's rise to prominence was one fraught with hardship, pain, tears, and blood. Born into a Palestinian Christian family, as a young man Habash immediately joined the Arab fedayeen against the Italian occupation of the Levant following World War Two. A convinced Marxist, Habash founded the Arab Nationalist Movement, a wide front of socialists, communists and left-wing Arab nationalists fighting against Italian and Zionist occupation of the Levant - waging a violent guerrilla war against the fascist invaders while declaring their commitment to turn the Levantine lands into an independent, non-denominational, socialist republic.\n\nDespite internal divisions among the Levantine Arabs, largely thanks to Arafat attempting to sell his land to fascists and Zionists from under his own feet and Hussein's unrepentant reaction and greed - Habash and the ANM have finally achieved their revolutionary goals. The peoples of the Levant rose up against imperialism and bigotry, a crowning victory after years of popular struggle, and the country now marches ahead to build its new future, with Comrade Secretary-General Habash charting the course.\n\nHowever, Habash's struggle is far from over. Zionist militias such as Irgun, and even large sections of the Haganah, have taken up a bitter resistance against the new People's Republic, and among the Arab people, reactionary and fundamentalist sentiments still creep like a snake in the darkness, spreading their counter-revolutionary poison among the people. Now, Habash must defend what he conquered - defend the people, defend the idea, defend the Revolution. Only time will tell if the light of socialism will live on in the Levant, or if its flame will be stamped out by the rising darkness."

 ime_hotline_jerusalem:0 "Hotline Jerusalem"
 ime_hotline_jerusalem_desc:0 "Since the end of World War Two, the Levant has been one of the most troublesome areas of the newly acquired Italian empire. Ethnic conflicts, fierce resistance to Italian rule, and an inhospitable terrain have made the region into a hotbed of insurgency and rebellion, and the continuous crackdowns and repression of the past have proved ineffective. Now, a semblance of peace has been achieved in the Levant, as an uneasy truce has been brokered between the Italians, Haganah, and Fatah - however, governor Dalla Chiesa knows that such a situation is not destined to last. We must continue to solidify the existing relationships between us and our reluctant allies, otherwise all hope of maintaining the region stable will be lost."
 ime_yesh_matzav:0 "Yesh Matzav"
 ime_yesh_matzav_desc:0 ""The situation" - this is how the many Jews of the Levant refer to the somewhat peculiar circumstances they live in. Many of them were already here before World War Two, but a significant wave of Jewish immigrants reached the shores of Palestine during the chaos that rocked the Nazi empire in the 50s - as Italy decided to let them in and give them a place to settle in their ancestral homeland, hoping to gain a loyal ally in governing the region. Reality was much different, of course - the Jews weren't interested in becoming loyal subjects of Italy but much preferred to keep to themselves, and now some half a million Jews live in the territories of the Italian Levant, most of them concentrated in northern Palestine. Keeping the majority of the Jewish population content with our rule is fundamental to maintaining peace in the region, as it is the only way to contain the spread of Irgun and radical Zionist ideas."
 ime_confirm_kibbutzim_self_rule:0 "Confirm Kibbutzim Self-Rule"
 ime_confirm_kibbutzim_self_rule_desc:0 "Although many Jews of the Levant live in large cities, especially Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem, most of them live in newly built settlements in the countryside, known as kibbutzim. A kibbutz is a collective community, usually based on agriculture, which aims to be self sufficient and to be able to protect itself from attacks, with numerous kibbutzim having their own garrisons affiliated with Haganah. While initially there were attempts to directly govern the kibbutzim, we soon discovered that allowing them to autonomously govern themselves is a much better and cheaper option, as most of the Jews living there are simply looking to live their lives free of oppression and persecution. We shall push for new legislation confirming and expanding the autonomy of the kibbutzim, and reinforcing our pact with Haganah to allow them to defend themselves."
 ime_crackdown_on_illegal_settlements:0 "Crackdown on Illegal Settlements"
 ime_crackdown_on_illegal_settlements_desc:0 "One of the major causes of contention and discord between the Jews and other populations of the region, chiefly the Arabs, is land issues. When Jews were settled in the Levant, they were assigned some of the most fertile and rich land in the region, much to the dismay of the native Arabs who wished to keep it for themselves. To further complicate matters, in many cases Jewish settlements started to encroach on land which hadn't been granted to them, further escalating conflicts. By setting up an ad hoc bipartisan commission of surveyors, agronomists and legal experts, we can attempt to peacefully resolve such land conflicts, evicting squatters and offering compensations for those who have been deprived of their land."
 ime_legalize_illegal_immigrants:0 "Legalize Illegal Immigrants"
 ime_legalize_illegal_immigrants_desc:0 "Among the many Jews who came to live in Palestine, many of them entered the territory through less than legal means over the course of the years. Whether hidden in ship containers or tucked in a truck crossing the deserts, many risked everything with the hope of joining their relatives and friends who immigrated here or simply to escape the bloody claws of the Nazi eagle. However, these illegal immigrants represent a problem - often impoverished and either sheltered by a kibbutzim or living in poor quarters of large cities such as Haifa and Tel Aviv, they often escape our grasp and are in danger of being radicalized by Irgun. By extending programs to register and legalize illegal immigrants, we can obtain more precise census data, slow down the spread of radical Zionism, and extend an olive branch to the Jewish community of the Levant."
 ime_resolve_land_disputes:0 "Resolve Land Disputes"
 ime_resolve_land_disputes_desc:0 "One of the major causes of contention and discord between the Jews and other populations of the region, chiefly the Arabs, is land issues.

 ime_solidify_havlaga:0 "Solidify Havlaga"
 ime_solidify_havlaga_desc:0 "Since before the Second World War, Haganah has been the major Jewish militia in Palestine. Its relationship with the other prominent Jewish paramilitary has always had its ups and downs - while Irgun has always been much more aggressive, often on the offensive against the Arabs and the British (and later, against us Italians), Haganah has usually been content with operating as a purely defensive militia, guarding the kibbutzim against aggressors. This policy is known as Havlaga, the Hebrew word for "self-restraint". We should enter talks with the Haganah leadership to ensure that this policy remains firmly in place and that the Jewish militias remain firmly inside their territory - if Haganah units begin to feel threatened and lash out against the Arabs, all hope of peace might be dashed."
 ime_support_rabin:0 "Support Rabin"
 ime_support_rabin_desc:0 "Among the ranks of Haganah, like in all political organizations, there is much more going on than it looks like at first glance. Many different factions with different visions about the future of the Jewish community struggle for leadership, and while in the past Haganah has been less than amicable towards Italy, the current leader of the organization has adopted a policy of negotiation, rather than open confrontation. Yitzhak Rabin, the supreme commander of Haganah, is not only an expert commander but also a charismatic politician and a skilled negotiator, and someone we would very much as a friend, rather than as an enemy. By helping Rabin cement his position as the leader of Haganah, we will be able to sleep soundly knowing that while we can't completely trust Haganah, we won't have to worry too much about them either."
 ime_the_jewish_national_council:0 "The Jewish National Council"
 ime_the_jewish_national_council_desc:0 "Since British times, the Jewish National Council was the supreme representative body of all the Jews living in the Levant. After our conquest of these lands, we allowed the Council to continue its activities, although its true powers are little and concern only the Jewish communities. Elected representatives of Haganah, the numerous kibbutzim, and all the Jewish people of the Levant make up the Council, and of course some of them are much more peace minded and conciliatory than others. By supporting friendly politicians and representatives in the Council, we can at least attempt to sway the Jewish public opinion towards more reasonable positions, which at least don't involve actively trying to shoot anyone wearing an Italian uniform."
 ime_an_armed_peace:0 "An Armed Peace"
 ime_an_armed_peace_desc:0 "Our efforts to appease the Jewish population of the Levant have proved relatively successful - the spread of Irgun has been at least contained, the policy of Havlaga has been firmly cemented, and the leadership of Haganah is at least willing to sit at a table with us. However, while it's much better than what we had in the past, such a peace is still fragile. The Jews are still scared of what might happen to them should a less complacent governor fill Dalla Chiesa's spot in the future, or Italy's policy towards the colonies should change, or some other catastrophe were to befall them. We can only hold on for more time, hopefully waiting until new orders come from Rome."
 ime_si_vis_pacem_para_bellum:0 "Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum"
 ime_si_vis_pacem_para_bellum_desc:0 ""If you seek peace, prepare for war" - this old Roman adage was as true in the times of Scipio and Augustus as it is today. After all, diplomacy can only go so far, and the Levant simply wouldn't be able to exist as a governorate of Italy without its brave garrison, which counts some among the finest man of all the Empire. By reviewing and modernizing the garrison, we can keep the Levant safe from threats both internal and external, while making sure that anyone who wishes to openly challenge the might of Italy in these lands will have to think twice before doing so."
 ime_review_the_garrison:0 "Review the Garrison"
 ime_review_the_garrison_desc:0 "There are numerous units that make up our garrison, but as our land based territory doesn't require the services of the Regia Marina, most of our men are drawn from the brave soldiers of the Regio Esercito, the daring airmen of the Regia Aeronautica, the proud Carabinieri and, sadly, the largely useless blackshirts of the MVSN. With the exception of the MVSN, which has been largely phased out of active duty in the region due to their proven incompetence, our units are among the proudest of all Italy, but there is still much room to improve. New doctrines, training regimes and budget allocation plans will make sure that our garrison is able to hold fast against anything that threatens us."
 ime_come_folgore_dal_cielo:0 "Come Folgore Dal Cielo"
 ime_come_folgore_dal_cielo_desc:0 "A consistent part of our soldiers are made up of paratroopers drawn from the Folgore and Nembo divisions, who gained their fame during World War Two for their victorious exploits against the British troops of Egypt. These soldiers are not only elite troops, but their nature makes them capable to strike anywhere at any time, providing an excellent rapid response to any kind of threat. Together with the Regia Aeronautica, the paràs give us control over the sky - by expanding airfields and further drilling our paratroopers, we can truly exploit this advantage and ensure that those who dare raise arms against us will receive a swift punishment from above."
 ime_the_capercaille_feathers:0 "The Capercaille Feathers"
 ime_the_capercaille_feathers_desc:0 "The Bersaglieri are among the most famous units of the Regio Esercito, formed as a highly mobile light infantry unit all the way back in the early 19th century, even predating Italy itself as a unitary state. During World War Two, the Bersaglieri saw action in various theatres of the war, and later went on to become Italy's most important mechanized and armoured infantry unit. Specializing in rough terrain and quick movements, the Bersaglieri now make up a large component of the garrison in the Levant, and by investing in these elite troops and improving on their mechanization and drilling, we can ensure that our military might in the region remains uncontested."
 ime_carabinieri_primacy:0 "Carabinieri Primacy"
 ime_carabinieri_primacy_desc:0 "The Carabinieri are the national gendarmerie of Italy, formed in the early 19th century by the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, decades before the unification of Italy. Since then, they acquired more and more prestige as a loyal and versatile force who proved its worth in combat roles, law enforcement, and military police, having their own mechanized, armoured and even paratrooper divisions. Formally a part of the Regio Esercito, the Carabinieri largely have their own autonomous command structure, and have always been present in large numbers in the Levant, with governor Dalla Chiesa himself coming from the ranks of the Carabinieri. The relative autonomy of the Carabinieri means that, especially here in the Levant, they are rather uninvolved in the politics and scheming that tends to happen in the high command in Rome, and their general lack of sympathy for fascism is all the more reason why they should be kept firmly in place as the cornerstone of the garrison."
 ime_expand_sim_operations:0 "Expand SIM Operations"

Italy's military intelligence service, the Servizio Informazioni Militari, has been active for decades in every corner of the vast Italian Empire, in some places more efficiently than in others, often in tandem with the Carabinieri. Without the SIM, we might as well be deaf and blind - and some worrying early reports have arrived describing movements along the Turkish border. It's probably nothing, but we must always keep our spies and agents of the SIM on high alert, just in case."
 ime_the_northern_border:0 "The Northern Border"
 ime_the_northern_border_desc:0 "The northernmost part of the Governorate of the Levant has always received much less attention as the rest of the region - not as oil rich as Transjordan, not as troublesome as Palestine. Southern Lebanon is inhabited largely by Shia Arabs, and the gentle hills of the region are dotted by small garrisons and outposts, while in the northeastern region of Jabal al-Druze, the rough mountains and hills are inhabited by the Druze people, which hasn't really caused us much trouble in the past, and thus the entire area has little in the way of garrisons. However, with the recent news of trouble in the Triumvirate and now proved Turkish movements in Syria and northern Lebanon, we have to act fast. The northern border must be fortified and patrolled, and we must be ready for anything coming our way from Turkey - we already have enough problems of our own without a foreign invasion further complicating matters."
 ime_reinforce_jabal_al_druze:0 "Reinforce Jabal al-Druze"
 ime_reinforce_jabal_al_druze_desc:0 "During World War Two, Italy's lofty imperial dreams encompassed the entirety of the Middle East, including the whole of Syria. Of course, actually enforcing these claims was a tall order, as the other Axis powers, specifically Turkey, had other plans. Just as Italian troops entered Syria from the south, Turkish soldiers were racing southwards from the north, smashing through Allied lines in a deadly pincer movement. In the end, the Italian-Turkish border was drawn were the armies had met, and only the southern region of Jabal al-Druze remained in Italian hands. A mountainous, rocky and arid region with few important towns, the region is dotted by villages inhabited by the Druze people, a religious minority which has historically been content to work with foreign overlords in exchange for a degree of autonomy. With the Turkish threat now looming from the north, the region is however a critical weak spot, and we must make sure that the region is impregnable to any invader - new fortifications must be built, exploiting the terrain to our advantage, and the local population must be convinced that taking up arms against the Turks is in their best interest if they don't want to deal with an overlord far more oppressive than us."
 ime_tall_cedar_trees:0 "Tall Cedar Trees"
 ime_tall_cedar_trees_desc:0 "Lebanon is a land of staggering diversity, both in its terrain and in its people. The mountainous interior gives way to gentle hills and rolling plains towards the coast, with large and important cities dotting the territory. While numerous ethnic and religious groups inhabit the region, including Greeks, Armenians, Arabs, Alawites, Druzes and more, most of the population in southern Lebanon is made up of Shia Arabs, but numerous refugees from the north escaped southwards across the border, to Tyre and other cities, to escape Turkish oppression. Lebanon will be our first line of defense in case of Turkish aggression, and we have an asset the Turks don't - the people. Many are wary of Turkey's oppressive regime and harsh stance towards ethnic and religious minorities, and many would be willing to take up arms against the invaders - by putting guns in the right hands and organizing the right militias, we can ensure that Lebanon will be turned into a meat grinder for Turkish troops, who will find themselves surrounded by partisans and guerrillas at every step they take."
 ime_limes_imperii:0 "Limes Imperii"
 ime_limes_imperii_desc:0 "In ancient times, the border of the Roman Empire, known as limes, was something more resembling a vaguely defined frontier, where commerce and movement of peoples and goods constantly took place under the aegis of the Caesars. Over time, the limes became increasingly militarized as the Empire's might faltered and civil strife rocked it from within, while its many enemies prepared to exploit its weakness and descend upon it. Now, Italy's faltering Empire has her own limes, and it's here in the rocky, arid lands of the Levantine borders. With a Turkish invasion now clearly coming for us, we must stand and fight - for even if we are nothing but a governorate in the far reaches of the Empire, victory or defeat here will have far reaching consequences for all of Italy, and perhaps the world."

Founded as the major Arab organization in the country following an uneasy alliance - while its main goal is independence for an Arab state in the Levant and opposition to Zionism, many in Fatah would like to see the creation of a democratic state, while more conservative Arabs look with favour towards Transjordan and its autocratic emir. While the majority of Fatah supports its leader, Yasser Arafat, who is a committed supported of democracy, a vast amount of funding for the organization comes from the deep coffers of emir Hussein, giving him a vast influence over the movement. This uncomfortable situation is nonetheless mitigated by a truce we managed to agree upon with Fatah, but there is much to be done if we want the peace to hold."

Its organizational scheme is quite complex, with numerous wings and branches devoted to different tasks, and its nature make it a nearly omnipresent presence in some regions, such as in the West Bank of the river Jordan. While a direct move against Fatah would prompt widespread insurrection, we must continue to keep a close watch on their operations around the Levant, to make sure that we're in control of the situation and worst of all, that Fatah isn't working with more extremist Palestinian cells associated with the ANM."

 ime_new_palestinian_villages_desc:0 "With the introduction of modern agricultural techniques, the population of Palestine has experienced a boom in the mid 20th century, which further exacerbated tensions in the region. As large amounts of Palestinians were evicted to make way for Jewish settlers, numerous Arabs are now relegated in impoverished slums around the largest Arab cities of the Levant, such as Jerusalem and Gaza. Of course, such places are breeding grounds for radicalism and violent extremism. We must invest in the construction of new Palestinian villages furnished with all the commodities to ensure their livelihood - easy access to water, irrigation networks, and well kept roads. By showing the Arabs of Palestine that we are working for their sake, we'll hopefully convince them to at least resent us a bit less."

 ime_expand_local_autonomy_desc:0 "Many Arabs have been very discontent at our decision to grant a degree of autonomy to Jewish settlements in the Levant, which of course was perceived as an unfair and unequal choice and a clear sign of Italy's zionist goals. At the same time, governing the Palestinian territories has proven extremely difficult and costly, both in money and in lives. Now that the situation is a bit more stable, we can finally attempt to expand democratic representation and autonomy for local Palestinian communities, by allowing them to express their voice on some local matters and forming democratically elected councils. Of course, the goons in Rome don't need to hear about this."

A scion of the noble house of the Hashemites, who claim descent from the Prophet Muhammad himself, he has distinguished himself as an exceedingly skilled and cunning ruler - an able negotiator, he was able to get in Italy's good graces by welcoming Rome's domination of the Levant and by offering to help ENI take over and expand oil extraction in Transjordan, using the profits to modernize his realm and solidify his rule. While we are forced to depend on this uneasy ally, emir Hussein is no sincere friends - a known financer of Fatah, we suspect that the emir has grand ambitions and is willing to use every dirty trick in the book to expand his already large influence. As the old saying goes, keep your friends close and your enemies closer, and we should keep Hussein as close as we can."

 ime_review_the_arab_legion_desc:0 "When the Ottoman Empire collapsed and the British took over supremacy in this part of the Middle East, the Arab Legion was founded as the armed forces of the newly formed Emirate of Transjordan, which was to be a vassal state of London - thus, the Arab Legion was formed of native soldiers, but led by British officers. When our victorious troops defeated perfidious Albion, we saw no reason to eliminate the Arab Legion, and instead simply took it over, with Italian officers replacing the British. Now, the Arab Legion garrisons Transjordan, acting as law enforcement, patrolling the western deserts, and putting down banditry in the region. While its rank and file soldiers are much more loyal to Hussein rather than us, sending more Italian officers to its ranks while turning it into a more effective fighting force is the only way to keep Transjordan and its vital pipelines and oil fields safe."

 ime_infrastructure_in_transjordan_desc:0 "Oil is the black blood of the Empire's economy, but it needs veins in which to flow. Transjordan has rich oil reserves but little in the way of industrialization, which makes building refineries a tall order - crude oil must be either shipped away across the Mediterranean or funneled all the way to the vast refineries in the Italian possessions in the Persian Gulf. Both of these things require kilometers and kilometers of pipelines and roads built across the harsh desert landscape and the hills of Palestine, which if left unpatrolled are an easy targets for bandits and terrorists alike. We must make sure that the vital infrastructure that brings oil away from Transjordan is kept in a good shape, and our economic resources will greatly benefit from this."

While once it was formed by elected representatives from various parties, when we took over the region we turned it into an advisory body made up mostly of appointed officials whom we bought off or pressured into working with us. However, the rising influence of Fatah and the clamour for liberalization means that now the Committee is filled with either supporters of Arafat and his movement or admirers of emir Hussein and his court. While both parties dislike us, we can use their strife to our advantage, in order to at least buy time and keep the Arabs divided while we try to keep the Levant together."

Fatah isn't nearly the only movement seeking independence for Palestine, and its perceived moderation brought many to join the ranks of the ANM, while Fatah and Arafat himself are clearly not too content with sitting at a table with us, and emir Hussein is still scheming in Amman. We managed to keep the truce going on for some more time, but for how long will it last?"

With the collapse of the Triumvirate and the sudden worsening of Italo-Turkish relationships, the war was in the air - and yet, we didn't expect it so soon. Our soldiers are valiant and well equipped, but it is a force centered around counter insurgency rather than conventional warfare - and the Turkish forces are stronger in numbers, threatening to overwhelm us. A static, traditional defense would be our doom - eventually, we would get overrun by the Turkish black bull charging our way. Instead, we should focus on a strategy of asymmetrical warfare, using counter attacks, guerrilla warfare, commando operations and other such tactics to take down our enemy. However, waging such a war might be impossible without the support of the peoples of the Levant, and getting the Jews and the Palestinians to fight alongside us is vital to our war effort."

However, while in recent times Italy generally attempted to rule with a relatively gentle hand, respecting existing institutions (such as the Egyptian monarchy), Turkey's reign over Syria and northern Lebanon was especially brutal, with harsh repression and violence being common. For this reason, the Arabs of the Levant are wary of what would happen should Turkey come to become the new hegemonic power in the region, and motivating them to fight for us should be fairly easy. We will begin talks with emir Hussein and with Yasser Arafat to coordinate the actions of Arab forces against the Turkish menace."

As new recruits are flocking to al-'Asifah, driven by the calls to fight against the invading Turks, we can turn them into a powerful weapons against our enemies, using them as guerrillas and militias - we need only give them weapons and ammunition, and send them on their way to fight the Turks."

By allowing Fatah to reinforce contacts and a shared command network with the smaller bands of fedayeen operative in the country, we can turn the entirety of the Levant into pure hell for the advancing turks - behind every tree, under every rock, and at each turn in the road they'll find a rifle aimed at them.

Many of them have formed resistance and guerrilla organizations to resist against Ankara's repression, which have established contacts with Fatah. By using knowledge of the harsh and difficult Lebanese terrain, we can set up operations to smuggle weapons and ammunitions to these Lebanese groups, who will harass the Turks behind their own lines and provide us with vital intel regarding their movements in the region."

For this reason, when the war broke out, many Arab volunteers ended up in fedayeen militias fighting against Turkey. They may not like us, but they dislike Turkey more, and that's enough. By encouraging and arming Arab volunteers fighting in the Levant, we can tap into a nearly inexhaustible source of committed and often experienced fighters, who will join guerrilla and resistance organizations in Turkish territory and grind down their offensive to a halt."

For this reason, there have been numerous proposals to set up a parallel Arab high command, working in tandem with our own, which will coordinate the efforts of Fatah, the Legion, and the various fedayeen groups.

Mostly a loose organization of various communist, socialist, marxist and nasserist militias and fedayeen groups, the Harakiyyin are united by their violent opposition to Italian rule and to Zionism, often attacking Jewish settlements as well as Italian garrisons. They've always proven a major thorn in our side, and a source of trouble which has made it difficult for us to focus our efforts against the Turks. However, with our recent pro-Arab ouvertures, we might be able to negotiate a truce with the Harakiyyin, at least until the war is over.

To avoid this catastrophe, our high command has drafted Operation Palmyra - a defense plan designed to exploit our few advantages and achieve victory against the Turkish juggernaut.

For this reason, attempting to hold fast against the Turks in a conventional manner would likely result in disaster - we'd inevitably get overrun by their superior numbers and firepower. Instead, we shall focus on a highly mobile defense strategy, using a system of tactical retreats, counterattacks, ambushes and flanking movements to ensnare the Turkish troops, cut off their supply lines, and finally crush them in a joint operation attack."

For this reason, we shall organize a network of units tasked with remaining behind enemy lines as the Turks advance and the main bulk of our units retreat. Then, the stay behind units will attack the rear of the advancing Turkish troops, and then our main force will counterattack the Turks as they're taken by surprise.

Italy was one of the first countries to develop a powerful air force, and it was the first country in history that utilize airplanes to bomb enemy troops, during the First Italo-Turkish War itself.

By creating a joint planning board including Haganah and Arab Legion officers and generals overseen by us, we'll be able to coordinate Jewish and Arab efforts against the Turkish menace. Sure, this will inevitably cause scuffles and the first meetings of Arab and Jewish officers will likely turn into shouting matches, but the steady and devastating march of the Turkish menace leaves us with little choice - fight together, or die alone."

 ime_for_the_levant_desc:0 "While tensions between Arabs and Jews are still high, the rhetoric of the propaganda of both sides is starting to change in tone in an interesting way. For Arafat and Fatah, the most dangerous enemy of the Palestinian and Arab people is no longer the encroaching Zionist plans of domination, but the oppressive yoke that Turkey wishes to place on Palestine just as it did on Syria - and for Haganah, the greatest obstacle to a Jewish homeland is no longer the terrorism committed by the Arabs, but the ever expanding tyranny of the Turkish state. While they certainly don't love each other, Arabs and Jews are now somewhat more willing to tolerate each other in the face of a common enemy, and that already is a sign for hope."

To make matters worse, they even made an announcement denouncing our cowardly and underhanded methods. This has given them a major propaganda victory as well as badly hurting our public image."
 ime.70.a:0 "To hell with these Arabs!"
 
 ime.71.t:0 "Succesful Leak - Irgun Attacked"
 ime.71.d:0 "Success! The Irgun has taken the bait and launched a major assault on one of our fortified positions. Having revealed themselves in the open, we were able to bring to bear our heavy weapons and fire support, decisively crushing their attack.The Irgun's strength has been badly affected by their failed attack, and their activity in the weeks and months ahead will likely be heavily curtailed."

 jercon.1.t:0 "The Conference Begins"
 jercon.1.d:0 "Palestinian, Israeli, and Italian delegations have all convened in Jerusalem to finally bring about peace in the Levant. Organized by the efforts of PM [insert PM here], the conference is hoped to bring about a lasting solution to the numerous issues plaguing the Italian Middle East, namely the Palestinian-Israeli tensions that have dominated society. While some have criticized this as a move for re-election, our cause is valiant, and is part of our obligations as a member of the global community. It remains unclear if the Conference has any chance at succeeding, but so long as all enter with good faith, there might still be a chance for peace."
 jercon.1.a:0 "Let us pray for its success."
 
 jercon.2.t:0 "The First Round"
 jercon.2.d:0 "The first round of negotiations will touch upon the prioritization of water for communities, the issue of the Bedouin nomads, the construction of oil pipelines, and the distribution of oil money. The fairest solutions must be negotiated, for the safety and prosperity of the Levant. But we must tread carefully, for any missteps could lead to the conference ending prematurely."
 jercon.2.a:0 "Can peace truly be stopped?"
 
 jercon.3.t:0 "The Water Question"
 jercon.3.d:0 "A fierce debate has erupted over the prioritization of water in the Levantine countryside, with the main subjects being Jewish Kibbutzim -- agricultural communes -- and Arab villages. The case for prioritizing water for the Kibbutzim is obvious -- agriculture is generally water-intensive. However, the Palestinian delegation has lobbied for water to be prioritized for Arab villages, so that they may practice their own form of agriculture. In the end, it is Italy's decision as to who gets the most water."
 jercon.3.a:0 "Jewish Kibbutzim."
 jercon.3.b:0 "Arab Villages."
 
 jercon.4.t:0 "Agricultural Subsidies"
 jercon.4.d:0 "Agricultural subsidies have historically been used to fund the general modernization of Levantine agriculture. Now, they are being fought over by both sides over who gets the lion's share of the money. Various arguments such as the relative lack of irrigation in Palestinian farms or the continued expansion of Kibbutzim have been brought up. Once more, both delegations look to Italy to decide this issue, as the mediator of the conference."
 jercon.4.a:0 "The Jews will receive subsidies."
 jercon.4.b:0 "Fund the Palestinians."
 
 jercon.5.t:0 "The Nomad Question"
 jercon.5.d:0 "Bedouin nomads roam around the south, where small skirmishes have taken place between them and other settlers, over various land disputes as well as consumption of resources. The Palestinian delegation has called for more legal protections for the Bedouins, as well as incentives for nomads to urbanize. The Jews, on the other hand, argue that the status quo is fine as-is, and that funds should be focused on better issues such as poverty and infrastructure overhauls. Once more, Italy must rule on this issue."
 jercon.5.a:0 "Less Protection."
 jercon.5.b:0 "More Protection."
 
 jercon.6.t:0 "Where The Black Gold Flows"
 jercon.6.d:0 "Unlike the rest of the Middle East, the Levant has little oil deposits, forcing it to rely on outside sources for its needs. As such, an additional oil pipeline shall be built in order to service their needs. The question is where exactly it should be built. The delegations have given their preferred options: Gaza and Tel-Aviv. The benefits of the pipeline being built in either city are obvious: it would provide numerous jobs to the local population during and after construction. Yet again, Italy must mediate this issue."
 jercon.6.a:0 "Tel Aviv."
 jercon.6.b:0 "Gaza."
 
 jercon.7.t:0 "For Whom The Black Gold Flows"
 jercon.7.d:0 "Now that the issue of the pipeline has been solved, the debate has moved onto the topic of the oil revenues. The Palestinians argue that the oil money would be better used by them, in order to install infrastructural improvements such as electric expansion as well as social housing. Meanwhile, the Israelis are pushing for them to receive the oil money for use in upgrading hospitals as well as expanding schools in the region. Ultimately, it is decided that..."
 jercon.7.a:0 "The Jews get the money."
 jercon.7.b:0 "The Arabs get the money."
 
 jercon.8.t:0 "Second Round"
 jercon.8.d:0 "With the issues of oil, nomads, agriculture, and water all resolved, the first round of negotiations has completed. The second round of negotiations begins now, with an agreement finally beginning to take shape. Sporadic protests have broken out in both Palestine and Israel, but they can be ignored. The agenda for this round of negotiations will be on refugee camps, reconstruction, the formation of a police force, Jerusalem, and the division of land."
 jercon.8.a:0 "We're making progress!"
 
 jercon.9.t:0 "Refugee Camps"
 jercon.9.d:0 "Refugee camps are, surprisingly enough, a hot issue amongst the delegations. The Israelis argue that priority should be given to them in order to house Jews making Aliyah. Meanwhile, the Palestinians argue that priority should be given to them, as immigrants from the Arab nations have started to stream into the Levant. Only one side can prevail in this matter, as there are not enough funds to fully accommodate the projected numbers presented by both sides."
 jercon.9.a:0 "Refugee Camps for Jews in the West."
 jercon.9.b:0 "Refugee Camps for Arabs in the East."
 
 jercon.10.t:0 "Levantine Reconstruction"
 jercon.10.d:0 "Reconstruction efforts have been going on intermittently, such as the repavement of roads, renovation of villages, as well as upgrades to sewage facilities. However, with the withdrawal of Italy from the Middle East, these reconstruction efforts would be better served focusing on either Judea or Lebanon. The Jews have pushed for Judea, as their historical homeland, to be reconstructed. Meanwhile, the Arab delegation has called for Lebanon to be reconstructed first, as numerous problems with infrastructure have been reported in the area."
 jercon.10.a:0 "Focus on Judea."
 jercon.10.b:0 "Focus on Lebanon."
 
 jercon.11.t:0 "A New Police Force"
 jercon.11.d:0 "A police force must be formed in order to fill the vacuum left by the Italian withdrawal. There are two options, with the Jews pushing for the Palmach organization to lead it, while the Arabs are pushing for the Arab Legion. The Palmach is the elite strike force of Haganah, while the Arab Legion is the former regular army of Mandatory Palestine, now commanded by independence groups. It is decided that..."
 jercon.11.a:0 "Palmach will form the police force."
 jercon.11.b:0 "The Arab Legion will form the police force."
 
 jercon.12.t:0 "Addressing the Jerusalem Controversy"
 jercon.12.d:0 "Jerusalem is an especially sensitive issue to both the Israelis and the Palestinians, given its role as a holy city for Muslims and Jews alike. As such, the Israelis are pressing for more rights and lands within the city. The Palestinians, on the other hand, argue that the status quo works just fine, and that no changes will be necessary. We must tread carefully, for many will be angered by the decision we take here."
 jercon.12.a:0 "Additional land and rights will be granted for the Jews."
 jercon.12.b:0 "No further adjustments are necessary on this issue."
 
 jercon.13.t:0 "The Great Divide"
 jercon.13.d:0 "The next issue on the agenda are the borders between the explicitly Arab lands and the explicitly Jewish lands. These are essentially the boundaries for settlement for both the Arabs and the Jews. Ever since the formation of the Italian Middle East, these borders have been unclear. The Arab delegation has pushed for the Jerusalem line, which favors them, as well as a general expansion of settlement rights for their side. On the other hand, the Jews have advocated for the Jordan line, which would expand the potential for further Jewish settlement. After tense negotiations..."
 jercon.13.a:0 "Jordan Line."
 jercon.13.b:0 "Jerusalem Line."
 
 jercon.14.t:0 "The Final Round"
 jercon.14.d:0 "The end grows near for the Jerusalem Conference, as all parties come closer and closer to reaching a full agreement on the status of the Levant. Peace is on the horizon, as the first drafts of the Jerusalem Accords have begun to be written. The next issues to be discussed are interfaith dialogue, a Good Neighbor Policy, new infrastructure, and trade. These are not as controversial amongst the delegations, and are essentially the finishing touches."
 jercon.14.a:0 "We are in the home stretch."
 
 jercon.15.t:0 "Interfaith Dialogue"
 jercon.15.d:0 "Most of the tension in the Levant can be attributed to the difference of religions between Jews and Muslims. Under our watch, interfaith dialogue programs shall be launched in order to promote religious tolerance. Furthermore, cultural exchanges will fall under the purview of such interfaith programs, in order to promote non-discrimination. However, the conference is split on who to focus on: the Jews or the Muslims. With a vote called, the result is as follows:"
 jercon.15.a:0 "The interfaith programs should focus on the Jews."
 jercon.15.b:0 "The interfaith programs should focus on the Muslims."
 
 jercon.16.t:0 "The Coexistence of Nations"
 jercon.16.d:0 "Italy is to enact a Good Neighbor Policy on the Levant, with economic aid, cultural exchanges, and mutual military assistance for all countries. However, fierce debate has been raging within the government over who we should focus our policy on. Rightists in the government are pushing for aid to be sent towards the Jews, while the more leftists are pushing for a policy in favor of the Arabs. After much deliberation, it is decided that..."
 jercon.16.a:0 "Priority should be given to the Jews."
 jercon.16.b:0 "Priority should be given to the Arabs."
 
 jercon.17.t:0 "East or West?"
 jercon.17.d:0 "Before full withdrawal can take place, we must make amends and do our part to rebuild the Levant. Italian companies will build new rail lines in either the east or the west for further economic development as well as ease of transportation. For obvious reasons, the Arabs are pushing for the rail line to be built in the East. Meanwhile, the Jews are calling for it to be built in the West. After hours of deliberation, it is decided that..."
 jercon.17.a:0 "West."
 jercon.17.b:0 "East."
 
 jercon.18.t:0 "Tariffs and Trade"
 jercon.18.d:0 "The issue of trade has been brought up, with the main problem with it being where it is being directed. Two possible solutions have been proposed: the sea and the ports, or the inland cities. Through ports, the importation of goods from faraway lands is far easier, although port expansions may take up money that could be better used elsewhere. Meanwhile, inland expansion would greatly improve infrastructure, at the cost of limiting our imports and exports. In the end, there can only be one."
 jercon.18.a:0 "Expand the ports."
 jercon.18.b:0 "Focus on the inland."
 
 jercon.19.t:0 "Forgetting Old Wrongs"
 jercon.19.d:0 "targai please put in a prompt"
 jercon.19.a:0 "Favor The Jews."
 jercon.19.b:0 "Favor The Arabs."
 
 jercon.20.t:0 "The End of the Jerusalem Conference"
 jercon.20.d:0 "The final drafts of the Jerusalem Accords have been distributed today, as the Conference winds down to its end. Through negotiation and compromise, an agreement has been reached between the two sides, to be ratified in the near future. With the issues and disputes having been resolved by the Conference, there remains a final question that must be answered, possibly the biggest problem for the delegates to resolve: whether or not the lands should be divided or remain together. However, with the previous success of the Conference, it is certain that a viable solution can be reached upon the issue. Sanity will prevail in the end."
 jercon.20.a:0 "The final choice awaits, and it is perhaps the biggest one of them all".
 
 jercon.21.t:0 "One or Two?"
 jercon.21.d:0 "On the last day of the Jerusalem Conference, everyone has gathered to discuss the possible formation of a Levantine Confederation or a partition of the lands. For the first time, the Jewish and Arab delegations have both split on the matter, with pro-Confederation and pro-Partition camps forming. Those that argue for a Levantine Confederation say that ethnocultural and religious tensions can be solved, and that in time, these tensions will fade. Furthermore, it would bring less of an economic shock to the region if the Confederation was formed. In the pro-Partition camp, they argue that sectarian violence would only worsen under one country, and that it would be better to work as independent allies, rather than two adversaries chained together. Both make compelling arguments, but there is only one solution. That is..."
 jercon.21.a:0 "The partition of the Levant."
 jercon.21.b:0 "The formation of the Levantine Confederation."
 
 jercon.22.t:0 "Irgun Growing in Power"
 jercon.22.d:0 "The paramilitary organization Irgun has recently exploded in membership and operations, with reports of increased activity across the Levant reaching our desk. Most in the government believe that it's for the best that we continue to work with Arafat, albeit with increased aid to help ensure this threat is combated. Others believe that we should contact King Hussein and get his aid in fighting the threat. Another, unspoken option, is to work with Irgun, while breaking our relationship with the Arabs."
 jercon.22.a:0 "Approach Emir Hussein."
 jercon.22.b:0 "Trust in Arafat."
 jercon.22.c:0 "A Deal With the Devil."
 
 jercon.23.t:0 "The JRM Forms"
 jercon.23.d:0 "With the ANM takeover of the Levant, several Jewish groups such as Lehi, Haganah, and Irgun, have merged into the Jewish Resistance Movement. Their purpose is to resist the ANM wherever possible, and in time, overthrow them. At the moment, we can only send arms and funding to the JRM, but already, shipments are being organized for their efforts. We can only hope from afar that the JRM's efforts will bear fruit in the future."
 jercon.23.a:0 "Let's hope we can get a hold on this situation."
 
 jercon.24.t:0 "A Meeting with Hussein"
 jercon.24.d:0 "The Governor-General has recently stepped out of a meeting with King Hussein with an interesting proposal. Hussein claims that Arafat is untrustworthy and is not negotiating in good faith.\n\nThe King maintains that in order to keep the peace in the Levant, it would be best to leak Arafat's location to the Irgun and let the Jews "handle" him for us. With Arafat out of the way, the Fatah will surely splinter, and thereby allowing us to negotiate directly with the King to secure a hopefully quick and advantageous agreement.\n\nBut, there's no telling what the ramifications of Arafat's assassination may bring if he's killed at all and perhaps it's best we keep things as is."
 jercon.24.a:0 "Leak Arafat's location to Irgun..."
 
 jercon.25.t:0 "Arafat Assassinated!"
 jercon.25.d:0 "Arafat is dead, killed by an Irgun attack on his safehouse. Already rioting has ensued in Arab majority territories with Jewish communities find themselves under siege by Arab paramilitaries. Haganah and Irgun clash with the ANM and Fatah in running gun battles in Jerusalem while our garrison struggles to get the situation under control.\n\nHowever, not all news is bad, King Hussein has been able to maintain order in Trans-Jordan and the Arab Legion remains in peak fighting condition. We shall contact Hussein and ask him to assist our beleaguered forces in maintaining order in the rest of the Levant. The King has served us loyally in the past there is no reason we that should change now."
 jercon.25.a:0 "Get me a line to Amman!"
 
 jercon.26.t:0 "A New Kingdom"
 jercon.26.d:0 "The Arab Legion marches west, King Hussein at its forefront. Disciplined soldiers and veteran officers sweeping aside Jewish and Arab paramilitaries alike. While the Legion fans out across the Levant to assist the garrison in crushing any stubborn holdouts, King Hussein departs to the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nWith cheering crowds and our approval, the Emir of Transjordan had declared the Kingdom of the Levant, with him at its head. Hussein has promised continued cooperation with the Italian Empire on top of his other promises of secular and constitutional rule. Many doubt his sincerity but it’s clear for the time being Hussein is wise enough not to bite the hand that feeds him, and we have secured ourselves a new ally in the Levant.\n\nHail King Hussein of the Levant! Saviour of the Levant! King of Jordan, Lebanon, Sinai and South Syria, Protector of Jerusalem and King of the Arabs!"
 jercon.26.a:0 "To future success and continued cooperation!"
 
 jercon.27.t:0 "A Meeting with Begin"
 jercon.27.d:0 "Menachem Begin was an unassuming man, bald and wearing spectacles he wasn't what one would expect of a man whose organization has caused him so much trouble in the Levant. Sitting at a table cleaning his glasses, the man looked almost grand-fatherly, not that Chiesa would ever fall for that.\n\nBegin wasted no time getting down to business. The request was fairly simple all things considered, Chiesa and, by extension, Italy, would support Irgun's takeover of the Levant. In exchange, Begin would keep the Levant within the Italosphere and allow the ENI to continue to use the pipelines which flowed through the region.\n\nA hard bargain he knew, but what choice did he have? The Haganah and Fatah were at each other's throats, the ANM grow more powerful by the day, and god knows what the Lehi was up to.\n\n"Do we have a deal Governor?""
 jercon.27.a:0 "We do."
 
 jercon.28.t:0 "The JRM Forms"
 jercon.28.d:0 "Our forces in the Levant have been forced into a humiliating retreat. The ANM has successfully instigated a general uprising, turning much of the population against us, and forcing us to withdraw. The presence of an anti-Italian state so closes the Suez is greatly destabilizing, not to mention the loss of the pipelines which connect us to the Oil fields of Iraq and Kuwait.\n\nHowever, not all is lost, the Jews of the Levant are no friends of the Arabs and have unified under the banner of the Jewish Resistance Movement. The JRM has approached us asking for support in overthrowing the ANM. In return, they promise the establishment of a pro-Italian state in the region. While the JRM represents an excellent opportunity to help restore some semblance of our old position in the Levant, many are wary of allying with the very people who caused us so much trouble in the past."
 jercon.28.a:0 "Give them our support, the Arabs need to be taught a lesson."
 jercon.28.b:0 "We cannot trust them."
 
 jercon.29.t:0 "Arafat Assassinated!"
 jercon.29.d:0 "Yasser Arafat, leader of the so-called "moderates" of Fatah, has been in hiding ever since the Socialists in the ANM have taken over the region. Fatah, while weakened, has retained a significant presence throughout the region, contesting with both the Jewish Resistance and the ANM.\n\nHowever, a mouse can only hide for so long, and Arafat's location has finally been discovered thanks to a helpful tip from our Italian friends. Already an elite detachment of the best fighters the JRM has to offer is converging on his position, he will not get away. It's time to put an end to this nuisance for once and for all."
 jercon.29.a:0 "Farewell, 'friend'."
 
 jercon.30.t:0 "Victory for the Jewish Resistance"
 jercon.30.d:0 "Across the Holy land, the fighters of Judah have risen. Aided by Italian supplies, we have successfully crushed the Arab radicals who would oppress our people, like the Romans of old. Their leaders are dead, and their fighters scattered. As we speak, the last holdouts are being hunted and destroyed.\n\nStanding over it all is Yisrael Galili, the enigmatic leader of the JRM. While Galili's plans for the future of the Levant remains unclear, it appears that it will be sometime before the Arabs will acknowledge us as the rightful owners of this land. Already there is talk of Arab resistance even as the ANM is driven out. Peace it seems will remain a distant goal."
 jercon.30.a:0 "To the fighters of Judah!"
 
 jercon.31.t:0 "An Israeli State"
 jercon.31.d:0 "We have done it! After months of struggle and conflict, we have defeated the ANM, and for the time being, crushed the last true obstacles to the formation of a Jewish state. As the flag of Zion rises above Jerusalem, the Jewish people have a home once more.\n\nHowever, discontent with the defacto military dictatorship run by the Haganah and Irgun is already starting to appear, and the issue of the native Arab population which outnumbers the Jews of the region by the substation margin grows more pressing by the day. The future of Israel remains cloudy and uncertain."
 jercon.31.a:0 "A homeland, if you can keep it."
 
 jercon.32.t:0 "Triumph for the Arab Nationalist Movement"
 jercon.32.d:0 "While they may have fought hard, without outside aid the Jewish Resistance ultimately could not stand up to the strength of the Arab Nationalists. Their leaders dead or in hiding and their fighters scattered and driven underground, it appears the last threat to the ANM has been defeated. Already there are celebrations in the streets, as the Socialists consolidate their position. The region's Jews have already seen record levels of emigration, while those that remain brace themselves for another generation under what they consider foreign rule. "
