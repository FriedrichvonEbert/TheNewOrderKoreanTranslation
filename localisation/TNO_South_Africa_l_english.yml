 POLITICS_VILLIERS_GRAAFF_DESC:0 "아버지의 케이프 타운 남작위를 계승한 드 빌리어스 그라프는 곧바로 남아프리카 정계에 입문했습니다. 하원의원으로 시작해 하원에서 경력을 쌓은 그라프는 56년에 통일당의 지도자로 선출되면서 고된 노력과 헌신이 성과를 거뒀습니다. 당수로서 권력을 공고히 하는게 의무적으로 필요했고, 성공하려면 카드집의 균형을 맞추고 국가의 분열을 막는 체제를 통해 자신의 길을 개척해야 했습니다.\n\n임명된 후, 그라프는 남아프리카가 가진 취약한 평정을 지키기 위해 혼신의 힘을 다해 균형 조정에 힘썼습니다. 대부분의 문제는 그에게 악의를 품고 뒤쫓으며 비수를 품고 뒤통수를 치고빠질 궁리만 하는 국민당과 보어로부터 기인합니다. 매일 시위를 벌이는 흑인들에 의해 설립되어 오랫동안 약속된 권리와 공정한 대우를 바라는 아프리카 국민회의도 또다른 문제입니다. 당연히 그라프의 해결책은 명확했습니다. 모두 억압하고, 그들 서로 싸우게 만들고, 저항을 누그러뜨리기 위해 몇가지 조건을 협상하는 것입니다.\n\n1962년, 남아프리카는 분쟁의 길로 나아갑니다. 국민당과 아프리카 국민회의 모두 가만있질 못하고 날이 갈수록 정부에 더욱 과격하고 위험해지고 있습니다. 독일인들은 케이프 식민지의 신선한 고기를 파헤칠 날을 고대하며 국경부근에서 발톱을 갈고 있으며 사람들의 자유를 파괴하리라 위협합니다. 당수 드 빌리어스 그라프는 지금까지 해온 모든 노력이 순식간에 파괴되지 않도록 조국을 올바른 방향으로 이끌고 대비해야만 합니다."

However, many of these groups, bolstered by strong public support and RK influence, are conducting operations in South African territory with the goal of overthrowing the government. We must deal with this problem, or a free south Africa will cease to exist."
 SAF_The_Empty_Throne:0 "비어진 왕좌"
 SAF_The_Empty_Throne_desc:0 "남아프리카 공화국은 공식적으로 여전히 군주국이지만, 실제로는 조지 6세가 죽은 이후 공위상태입니다. 정부는 엘리자베스 2세와 에드워드 8세 누구도 인정하지 않는데, 이는 OFN과 유니티팍트 양쪽을 적대하려 하지 않으려 하기떄문이며 이때문에 왕의 지위는 거의 10년동안 미궁에 빠져 있었습니다. 정부는 지금까지 이 문제에 대해 의견을 바꾸려하지 않지만, 남아프리카 공화국이 왜 군주제를 계속 유지해야 하는지에 대한 여론이 높아지고 있습니다."
 SAF_Desperate_Neutrality:0 "절박한 중립"
 SAF_Desperate_Neutrality_desc:0 "OFN이 남아프리카를 동맹으로 끌어들이려는 여러번의 시도에도 불구하고, 연이은 정부들은 일관되게 강력한 고립주의적 입장을 견지하고, 냉전에서 엄격한 중립을 유지하자고 주장해왔습니다. 북쪽의 독일 제국의 적대감이 높아지는 것을 원하지 않기 때문에, 우리 정부가 이 중립정책을 포기하려면 정말로 끔찍한 상황이 필요할 것입니다."

Their expertise in unconventional warfare will transform our forces into a creative army, which will be able to quickly react to the stratagems of our enemy. No longer will we waste precious lives in pointless defences. Instead, our men will blend into the landscape they know so well and strike out only when they know they can win.

To counter these pressures, we have developed a plethora of robust and unconventional stratagems to employ against the Germans and Boers. Ambushes. Insurgency. Psychological warfare. Fighting behind their lines. Every step closer our enemies take towards our borders will make them grow ever more fearful of what tricks the South Africans have up their sleeves. More often than not, our foes find their ranks already noticeably depleted by the time they reach the lines of conventional battle."

 SAF_Unconventional_Tactics_RK_desc:0 "On the open battlefield, our forces had no trouble whatsoever with the outdated army of South Africa. We were able to quickly overrun them in similar fashion to the Second World War. However, recent developments have given us more trouble than we would like to admit. The South Africans are beginning to utilize methods of warfare that we had not anticipated. The enemy now hides, making full use of their landscape to avoid direct confrontation. We now face ambushes and traps rather than conventional battles. Our soldiers are struggling to adapt to this dramatic shift in the war. Unless we can adjust equally as quickly, we suspect that the fight will rage on for longer than we could have anticipated."

 SAF_Unconventional_Tactics_RK_2_desc:0 "It seems that sudden ambushes and concealed explosives were the least of our concerns. Even as our troops begin to adjust to guerrilla warfare, the South Africans have begun changing their tactics one again. Ambushes are starting to take place behind the lines, focusing on our supply columns and bases. The men are suffering mentally from the constant raids too, as no matter where they are, the chance of an attack becomes increasingly common. The structure of South African divisions are shifting too. When captured, they have nothing of value to tell us, as their units now operate independently from their own high command. We must meet this problem head on."

 SAF_Unconventional_Tactics_RK_3_desc:0 "The days of swift victory over South African soldiers seem like an almost distant memory now. Now we find only new and frustrating surprises on the front lines and behind them. Our troops might take several miles of ground in a day, only to be driven back by their camp being set ablaze during the night. The issues with supplies continue, as the South Africans always seem to know which routes we are using, as we discover when our trucks detonate mines buried in the dirt. Even our air force now useless, as trying to bomb underground targets is a gamble at best. What scant few casualties we inflict pales in comparison to what the South Africans inflict with each of their raids. Nowhere is safe now, and there is very little we can do about it."

Under their watch, roads which lay incomplete for months were finished in weeks, kinks both known and heretofore unknown in the Force's weaponry were summarily ironed out, and techniques were introduced which improved our research labs' productivity by leaps and bounds. We are quite indebted to the West Indies for the exemplary individuals they have sent in our aid."

At least, until the Iberians came to an agreement with us to use it as a refueling and supply station.

And they answered it with sorrow and passion; at the call of Hertzog, members of the party are to come together so they may hold a vigil for the Führer.\n\nAnd in the name of the man they seem to mourn, they are calling for a week exclusive to Hitler's respect. People should light candles for the fallen German, businesses, they demand, should close down.\n\nReports of armed Boer men are reaching us, the details suggesting that they are organized by the National Party and are not only providing 'security' for the mourners but also forcing business to close down and threatening their political opponents. From Port Elizabeth up to Pietersburg, it seems that this is not something we cannot ignore. Hertzog is making a very interesting gamble on the behalf of his party, cleverly using this vigil as a way of rallying his supporters.\n\nHertzog proclaims that his lockdown of the country will stay until the South African government pay proper respects to Adolf Hitler and denounce what they called the Anglo-American imperialist interference on South Africa. We cannot let this happen. We cannot allow this to become greater than it is. They are defying the Dominion!"

One of the officers, Eugène Terre'Blanche, has refused to carry out his orders. He has gone over to the Boers, joining them as his fellow officers either observed him in shock or followed his example and deserted too.\n\nAccording to reports, the crowd was roused to applaud him. He spoke to them, delivering a big speech by the side of Hertzog, praising his policies and one independent Boer Nation. Terre'Blanche was known inside the SAP as especially devoted to the ideals of the National Party, seems that he's letting himself free to do as he pleases against any authority.\n\nSouth Africa cannot approve this. The whole country is watching him receive a glorious ovation from the masses out in the streets, insulting the authority of the Government. We are losing control of the situation. Not only he is defecting to them. Thanks to his actions, the rest of our officers are refusing to disperse the protests. If we do not do something soon, we may lose the country!"

 SAF.35.t:0 "When It Began"
 SAF.35.desc:0 "History has had a fascination for seminal events since mankind learned to write their names with stone and chisel.\n\nThe intuitive drive to envision the disorder that surrounds men as a series of causes and effects instills itself into common sense, so tempting them to regard certain happenstances as larger-than-life moments shifting time's course. A Serb ending an archduke's life, common sense would thus say, began a war that snuffed a continent's lamplights forever. A threat for a Polish port heralded a new order over Europe and the wider world. Thrice again, a grisly massacre in Cape Town marked the beginning of Africa's latest tragedy.\n\nBut common sense is faulty and full of holes. Human intuition is no less fallible in writing South Africa's narratives than in any other war it has seen. What it believes is a gargantuan conflict's violent outset is instead its largest battle up to that point -- the conflagration among a teetering powderkeg's flickers.\n\nOne such flicker emerged in a polling station in Pretoria, weeks before the nation decides between Dominion and Republic. Census workers found themselves harried by an assemblage of Boers, armed and exuberant. Not to be outdone, the Majesty's loyal subjects -- not His or Her Majesty, South Africa remained at an impasse over whose crown they swore fealty -- rallied onto the streets to meet the Afrikaners head-to-head. They carried the same guns and shared the same patrimony; nevertheless, their opinions over its destiny cannot be reconciled. Tensions simmered in the standoff, ugly differences brought to light with shouts and jeers.\n\nThen a shot rang loud. A man crumpled atop a pool of blood. Shouts became screams as muzzle flash lit the streets. A state of emergency postponed the referendum in Pretoria until further notice. The Boers rendered it moot weeks later.\n\nWho shot first was lost to time, but its aftereffects foreshadowed the years to come: democracy strangled at the crib; hundreds laid lifeless along the blood-soaked pavements; and a city whose infernos rose to mingle with the reddish hue of the sunset sky"

 SAF.36.desc:0 "Amidst the chaos caused by uprisings from the ANC and the Boers, our national security has suffered yet another blow. Last night, off the coast of Cape Town, a shockingly large formation of small go-fast boats were able to bypass our searchlights and land on Robben Island. From there, the boats' passengers-a number of highly-trained ANC militants-used mining explosives to blast a hole in the wall of the island's feared Maximum Security Prison. The guards, in the middle of a shift change, were undermanned and unprepared. What with the current military situation, many of them had already been retasked to other parts of the country. This failure to prioritize doomed the rest. After a number of desperate firefights in the prison's corridors, the guards were all killed or incapacitated, and the militants could make their escape. Accompanying them were a number of the island's most infamous prisoners.\n\nGovan Mbeki.\n\nOliver Tambo.\n\nNelson Mandela.\n\nAs alarms screamed across the island, the boats made their way back to the mainland. Already, there are calls in the press for an investigation into this utter failure of security. Police are blocking off major roads, but it's most likely that the escapees are already far from our grasp"

The protestors, surprised but also provoked at the army's presence, stood their ground, refusing to leave. The troops kept telling them but the Boers were pressing against them. Barricades were toppled, protestors were picking up rocks and throwing them at the men and rumors of armed Boers coming to help their kinsmen fight back were getting to the soldiers.\n\nConfused orders came through. Instructions to the contrary were issued. These mixed with the shouts of the protesters, the din of strife, and the sirens of abandoned police cars made the worst happen. In just several bursts from the rifles and carbines of the soldiers, forty people, none of them with weapons as feared by the alarmed troops, lay dead on the ground. The crowds were now dispersing, but not because they wanted to. They had to. Their brothers and sisters, their mothers and their fathers, they were scattered upon the ground, broken and bleeding.\n\nIt was a horrifying massacre. And the news of this came all over South Africa, turning the entire land against the Armed Forces. Only the worst can come out of this now."

Some broadcasts even noted that, with the ongoing Boer revolt, the opportunity for revolution has never been greater. Mere hours later, the few surviving security units in Durban began evacuating south, as the ANC's uMkhonto we Sizwe declared the city to be in free African hands.

His followers have taken weapons into their hands. There's no turning back now, a civil war is upon us.\n\nSouth Africa is coming apart, the great cities of Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Bloemfontein are falling into the control of the Boers. Angry militias are sprouting up all over the land, turning their weapons on anyone they think is on the side of the Government. The law of the land is lost and any semblance of order we once had is destroyed.\n\nThere is no way out of this but to fight. The more ground we lose to these people, the more our Republic steps closer to the grave which have been dug. Some might say this was our fault, but we must accept it quickly and begin our defense. For sooner or later, these Boers will be joined by those damned Germans from planed it all from the north! If war must be the only way out of this alive, if shedding more of the blood of these men can put an end to the division of our land, then so be it!

With one fell sweep, we will stop the Nazis from securing a new foothold in Africa, for if we do not, surely the brutal invasion of our South Africans will only be the beginning. If Africa falls, next falls India, then with the east secured, the Nazis will soon be in the Americas as well!\n\nAt least, this is the sentiment that every American general with a foot in the White House door has loudly shouted, berated the Senate over, rallied their troops with and harassed the media with as seemingly every man who has ever held a gun has proclaimed the time for a 'final battle' against the fascist menace.\n\nWhile many members of the Republican-Democrat party have seemed nervous over the situation, proposing some doubts that this 'Domino Theory' is as immediate a threat as proposed, or that entering war with direct servants of the Reich can end in anything besides a greater conflict, it is most surprising that several members of the NPP have stepped across the Senate aisle to agree. Leftists in the NPP have questioned what, exactly, the R-D dominated military establishment proposes as any end goal in this conflict, and what plan they may have to deal with Africa even if there is some sort of victory, while the far right of the party has showed some suspicious hesitance to do battle with the fascists.\n\nRegardless, however, the President seems dead-set on a policing action in the nation, President Nixon seemingly hoping that a knock out punch on the Reichskommissars will save his flagging administration and halt the impending impeachment vote."

But that was fine, he assures; for a minute of a family's time, South Africa will visit them in their own homes. Mayhaps soon they will visit South Africa too.\n\nThese advertisements are the brainchildren of Edison Cook, newest chairman of the South African Broadcasting Corporation and co-founder of the nascent American South Africa Public Affairs Committee. Tasked by Cape Town to "encourage closer ties between two free nations parted only by one ocean", he has successfully negotiated air time from each of America's country's Big Three networks for his organization's extensive public awareness campaign. Observant commentators have remarked of the concurrence between Mr. Cook's campaign and the commencement of hostilities in South Africa.\n\nDespite the veteran broadcaster's optimism, and his blank check, only time will tell if the imperiled democracy's newest ploy to sway America's spirit towards its defense will bear fruit."

A farmer he has been, he thought, and a farmer he will always be.\n\n"But months prior to the war, Harold realized his farmhands had been returning from the weekly trip to Kimberly erratically late. Years of habit established thus: They would leave at eight with a lorry full of produce, sell them to markets around the city, and come back home before lunch. Nowadays they would return between then and sundown at the latest. Harold had a mind to ask them what they've been doing, but ultimately held his peace. He'd trusted the Boer boys with his money for ten years now; why shouldn't he trust them on how they spend their time every Sunday?\n\n"Harold thought his life won't ever change. He also thought he shouldn't ask questions when it did. So imagine his surprise when Johan Anderson and Mattys Bosman returned to the farm at eight PM... with a lorryful of armed men.\n\n"The poor man neither spoke nor wrote of the events that followed as he recuperated in the city hospital, only that he escaped by the skin of his teeth.

 SAF.47.t:0 "American Muscle"
 SAF.47.desc:0 "As debates rage in Washington over what scraps to send South Africa's way and when, New York Harbor is host to a one-in-a-lifetime scene: Thousands of cargo trucks, lined up like a row of ducks, waiting patiently for a crane to pack them on a cargo ship's deck. Packed with more trucks than most towns have cars, these ships will soon depart for the faraway shores of the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nIn anticipation of an invasion of Europe and the Japanese Home Islands, the US Army issued General Motors a contract to produce their reliable CCKW trucks during the Second World War. The Pentagon expected hundreds of thousands of the so-called "deuce-and-a-halfs" forming the core of the Army's ocean-wide supply train. Detroit was more than capable and willing to fulfill such a lucrative contract, going so far as to reach its agreed-upon orders by spring 1945.\n\nUnfortunately, the invasion plans they were built to buttress were scrapped when mushroom clouds engulfed Pearl Harbor later that year. A good number entered the civilian market after the war -- just as many were left to flake off their army green paint jobs in warehouses across the fifty states.\n\nThe war in South Africa is akin to a second calling for these unused, unsung warriors. When Cape Town asked for trucks of all kinds to support their war effort, the White House and GM immediately had the other in mind. Days later South Africa agreed to take several thousands of GM's leftover CCKWs for a pittance of how much they cost GM to make, but several orders of magnitude more than the cost to bring them back to proper function. In other words, a rare win-win deal in the history of international trade.\n\nThough they were denied the war they were born to fight, the venerable deuce-and-a-half now joins the veld with factory-fresh engines, desert camo paint and the South African Union Defense Force's insignias on its sides. Hopes are high that it will perform there with the same gallantry it had shown the world twenty years ago."

 SAF.49.desc:0 "Accustomed as they are to the dark hair that accompanies either pale, fair or swarthy complexions, the assemblage that filtered out of the St. Ignatius in Cape Town harbor seemed like aliens from Mars for Cape Town's inhabitants: Pale, blond-haired, and blue-eyed. Wearing sharply tailored doctors' suits and nurses' caps, they stopped for neither the city's fine sights nor its fine people as they hurried to the Observatory's Groote Schuur Hospital. Befuddled onlookers wonder of the stoic, no-nonsense medicine men they were now saddled with.\n\nThis peculiar host of doctors and nurses is, of course, Iceland's own little commitment to the OFN's budding front in South Africa. Much to his dismay, General Hamilton Howze, de-facto governor of the island since the Second World War, professes that US Forces Iceland is too small to contribute a sizable force to the war without compromising its extant mandate. However, he adds, Iceland has among the most robust healthcare systems in the world; its health professionals on average are on par with the best America can offer, and its facilities are more than equipped to handle abrupt surges of wounded and diseased patients. Surges, incidentally, that South Africa will doubtless encounter as the war drags on.\n\nFor a nation six times smaller than the entirety of the Cape Province's capital, its medical staff is a testament to the weight it can punch in spite of its size. Their assistance is welcome regardless, as South Africa's health service infrastructure is strained to its limits by the exigencies of war."

Say what one will about the Federation's many failings, but its sandy beaches and tropical fruits seem to attract geniuses with the wherewithal to immigrate and the will to learn the Queen's English. They have since built the islands' piecemeal infrastructure up to a developed nation's standards since one war's end.\n\nNow, as the clarion call echoes in Kingston, the very same genius now board ships bound for another war to replicate their miracles in the Great Escarpment and beyond. No matter their paltry numbers, the West Indies' now-named "Boffin Bunch" remain a welcome addition to South Africa's own band of civil and military scientists."

 SAF.53.desc:0 "Since the days of colony, Canada has maintained a long tradition of military service in the name of God, King and Empire. The Old Dominion has always answered firm and true whenever London called for their aid. Its army's conduct in the First and Second World Wars, in particular, were nothing short of exemplary; around 1 in 12 of all Canadians had fought like heroes in the shell-pocked battlefields of France twice over.\n\nThough the Empire is now a sad memory, Canada has yet to err from maintaining an army belying its stature\n\nSuch is the case today as the Canadian Division disembarks from the Queen Mary in Cape Town Harbor. The spectacle that gathered throughout the coast was the most euphoric a war-burdened populace can muster: Ten thousands of little Union Jacks fluttered high alongside just as many little Orange, White and Blues while a band vivaciously trumpeted God Save the Queen near the waterfront. The mob sang along off-key of course, as did the squaddies surprised with the reception that greeted their first day in the veld.\n\nThen again, can one truly blame the Cape for so cheering for the Queen's men? They and theirs have long distinguished themselves from the innately rebellious Boers with an innate loyalty to the Crown. With this in mind, Canada's formal entry into South Africa's war proved that, though the Empire is dead, the loyalty that has bound the Queen to her dominions for centuries remain sturdy and stalwart against their foes."

Whether in East Africa or North Africa, shared experience in the battlefield has built up a camaraderie between the two far-flung Dominions that the fall of Empire cannot completely dissolve. Bolstering these feelings is an undercurrent of sympathy; after all, South Africa is as much of a bulwark as Australia and vice versa, but against the Nazis instead of the devils in Tokyo.\n\nSo is it any surprise that Canberra has sent ten thousand Australians to assist their brothers in their latest war? One would suggest that Washington had to goad it into doing so -- poppycock, naturally. More than anyone in the OFN, Australia recognizes the value of reciprocity; if it cannot show commitment to its duties, then who will show the same to Australia when the Rising Sun makes its move?\n\nNo, Australia and South Africa are brothers -- and brothers support each other in times of crises.

One free, democratic nation that has or had existed since the beginning of the 20th century. Say, France and England near the front and our own country, the United States, at the opposite end. The Second World War meant that a good half of the dominoes on this table had already fallen, just like this.\n\n"So many fledgeling democracies and their people, left to the tender mercies of the black fascist hand. All that remains are a couple handful of dominoes, the ones at the back end sheltered whether by distance, strength, fortitude, or a combination of all three. Right this moment, South Africa now forms the front tip of this shaky conga line... and with the war making like tremors and gusts battering the table, the South African domino has wobbled every which way since it began.\n\nI will not insult your intellect by stating the obvious repercussions of South Africa's demise. What I can do, however, is proffer a solution: An intervention to stop the tremors and gusts wherever and whenever they're found. One way or another, South Africa must not fall in our lifetimes.

The afternoon sun was making it hard to think.\n\nHis uncle had told him stories of the war in Britain. The soldiers there had been less surprised to hear French. Many Free French troops had fought in Britain. So had Polish pilots, Czechoslovak engineers, Russian exiles. American troops, their numbers almost as high as the desperate Brits, themselves fielding youth barely able to hold rifles and great war veterans with their grim desperation. All united against the fascist onslaught.\n\nOf course left unsaid by his uncle was that it had all been for nothing. Hundreds of French Canadians, buried under a cold and remote sun. The war had been unpopular then. This new war might be. Joseph had seen the protests back home in Québec city on his days of leave from Valcartier. A protester near the national assembly had coughed blood on him after getting in a fistfight. The fool didn't have to shout at him only for wearing a uniform, Joseph thought.\n\nIt felt good to be in the shade. The hangar was still extremely hot. The soldier leaned against the corrugated metal wall. Hopefully the war would be short. Hopefully only volunteers like him would make it to this foreign place. Hopefully, none of his comrades would find their final resting place so far from Québec's forest and plains."

Following the establishment of Iberian operations in South Africa, they now believe the situation to be appropriate to lease access to the island to us, granting us an invaluable logistical asset. Senior military officials believe that the ports of São Tome may be effectively used as a logistics waypoint, and further as a possible airbase for our bomber aircraft fleet.\n\nWhilst plans for the usage of the island remain in the preliminary stages, we have gratefully accepted the Iberian lease proposal, and it is estimated that logistical operations upon the island will commence in a matter of mere weeks.""

Their comrades on the frontline are in turn often running on amphetamines to maintain vigilance on endless patrols. In this they are joined by desperate locals consuming cheap amphetamines to curb hunger as they flee devastated fields and plantations.\n\nFor once the Germans and Americans are in agreement about something. But neither side is able to stem the tide of drugs flooding into the dark continent. Criminal syndicates from Asia transport entire productions of heroin to backwater ports that the Schild and OFN cannot monitor. Even without criminal activity, the vast amount of medicine brought in by both factions still presents a colossal risk potential. Overworked doctors prescribe drugs for any ailments, and officers often close their eyes on this problem to keep their soldiers sedated and functional. Soldiers from both sides torch as many fields of marijuana as they can, but their generals have little time for police work as they struggle to win their war. And through all this, private corporations funnel vast amounts of older pharmaceutical products to the continent where they serve as precursor for harder drugs.\n\nThe domestic reaction in America has been horror. Many refuse to see their children conscripted, lest they return home as dysfunctional addicts. Critics of the government's war effort see in this drug epidemic a microcosm of the entire South African mess; an impossibly large continent is impossible to fully control and monitor.

Green Beret units have been instructed to integrate themselves into TRIGGERMAN at multiple levels in an exclusively advisory capacity. This advising has multiple objectives:\n1) Improve the effectiveness of TRIGGERMAN as much as is feasible.\n2) Prepare TRIGGERMAN for integration with TORCH forces in the event of an invasion by CRUSADER.\n3) Cultivate good relations within TRIGGERMAN hierarchy and establish assets within both TRIGGERMAN and HOST.\n4) Identify TRIGGERMAN officers with possible CRUSADER sympathies.\nObjectives 3 and 4 are the primary goals of Colossus, and are well on track to be met.\n\nTORCH advisors from the Green Berets have compiled dossiers on every significant TRIGGERMAN officer, and have noted several sympathizing with our cause (See attachment A). Additionally, a clique of officers possessing dubious loyalty to FIELDS have been marked (Attachment B contains a full list). Plans to remove these officers from their positions are currently being formulated."

Priority information includes planned attacks against TRIGGERMAN or TORCH, communications between ORANGE and CRUSADER, identities of ORANGE leadership, and ORANGE cell locations across FIELDS. SOG operatives are to coordinate among one another and act on their own initiative to halt or hinder ORANGE activities in any way deemed necessary so long as it does not expose their cover.\n\nSOG operatives are not to report any of their findings to either TRIGGERMEN or TORCH. All findings on ORANGE during the course of Operation Rotterdam are to be sent directly to POLARIS.\n\nOperatives participating in Operation Rotterdam are to continue under these guidelines and send monthly status updates until an order to cease is received from POLARIS.

The truth, as with most things mediatic, is more nuanced. A small minority of Boers has opposed the violent separatism of their fellow citizens. The number of these loyalists has been growing thanks to the Boer Republic's willingness to abandon democracy and side with the northern fascists. Many of these young loyalists have joined the South African Defense Force and performed valiantly on the battlefield in the Queen's Boer Guard unit.\n\nIn turn, many Anglophone citizens are disgusted with the government's "weak response" to the ANC and have urged terrible retribution. At the war's outbreak, scores of fascist Anglophones have fled north to join the breakaway states, or have stayed home to act as an insidious fifth column "

And though we may stand alone and free, it cannot be ignored that we are not ready to endure any more trouble. Within and without, things are coming close to falling apart.\n\nIn our nation, increasing tensions among our citizens are becoming untenable. The Boers to the northwest are becoming more restless, seeking to impose their vision on us, demanding from us many concessions. It is thanks to Hertzog and the National Party that they have a voice in our Parliament, and such a voice is becoming louder and louder, bringing predictions of an unwanted but maybe inevitable uprising. And the African National Congress, a party founded by black citizens who are discontent with their living conditions and upset with the way we rule this land, is gradually becoming more daring and defiant. They have the support of many of their kind both internally and beyond.\n\nIn time, however, no matter how much we may not want it for it, something is going to happen. Consequences, both foreseen and not, are looming over our heads, becoming clearer to us only after it is too late. We must prepare for the future, doing everything we possibly can to preserve our Nation as the Crown's subjects, or else succumb to either the enemies within or the nightmare of the Reich."

Edward Geary Lansdale steadied himself, bringing his personal luggage with him, and walked away from the aircraft, forgetting about noise of the dying engines.\n\nHe looked forward to doing the things that he had done before, his identity and his motives protected by secrecy. He had not thought that he would quietly rise up the ranks and find his place here; he had humble beginnings, especially as a journalist. He maneuvered through the terminal and into the rest of the airport, finally reaching a car waiting for him.\n\nThe easy part was done. As he rode in the back, thinking over the more tedious details of his mission, Edward closed his eyes and envisioned the unit he would forge with the best this land and his own country would offer. Their name wouldn't be too suspicious; it was simply the Studies and Observations Group. But anyone looking closely, especially someone like him, would know that it was more than just a mere auxiliary entity.\n\nThis group would put dread into the hearts of those who seek to cause South Africa trouble, especially if they threaten the interests of the Free Nations. Those were Vice-President Kennedy's orders.\n\nThe Nazis will learn to fear them. If they would keep trespassing in the valley, he would sweep the shadows over them. He would harass them, divide them, press them, and take their comrades. He would search for their assets, destroy them, and fade away like a shade in the night. He would fill them with terror, even as they rested or waited for orders.\n\nAs long as he played his cards right, and for as long as he kept the unit nice and tight, he could ensure that his objectives were fulfilled."

 SAF.103.desc:0 ""Above all, we want equal political rights, because without them our disabilities will be permanent. I know this sounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. This makes the white man fear democracy."\n\nThe man speaking these words is Nelson Mandela, a man on trial for four counts of sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government, charges that will stick and will potentially lead to his execution. He is being tried alongside several other ANC members, in a case which has garnered considerable attention. Mandela has used this opportunity to bring attention to his cause. This opening to the defence proceedings has been a three hour speech. In it, he has justified the ANC's decision to go beyond constitutional methods and non-violent resistance, citing the increased restrictions placed on non-whites. Instead, they have embarked on a campaign of sabotage against property, while developing a military arm for possible future use.\n\n"But this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all," he continues. "It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs, as it certainly must, it will not change that policy."\n\n"This then is what the ANC is fighting for. Our struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by our own suffering and our own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live."\n\nHe turns to look the judge in the eyes, the last time he will do so in this trial.\n\n"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all people live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to see realised."\n\n"But if need be," he concludes, "it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""

All around him waited the rest of the Parliament; his colleagues in the National Party on his side, and the members of the United Party, their ranks dirtied by the presence of the English, reminding him bitterly of their treatment of his family who they forced into concentration camps. His eyes regarded them with terrible contempt, especially as he noticed Seretse Khama, the only black man present, observing the proceedings. While he obviously shared the same feelings his contemporaries had for the English, nobody would doubt that Albert would be more disgusted with the African.\n\nNevertheless, despite the presence of these people, he would have to make his move now. Albert steadied himself as the Parliament was called to order, the representatives of each party settling down in their seats. He waited until the speaker to proclaim to them that the floor was free for him to take. Then he began to speak to them, his voice loud and clear.\n\n"This land does not need to continue its existence under the watch of a monarch! In fact, for the many times I have proclaimed this, especially with my party, it is not necessary to seek the guidance of one. We can rule over this land as a republic with a president at its head. But what is the point of striving for this if this is not put forward to the people? For everyone to have their say, especially those who truly deserve to settle the land which they have called theirs since they've come?"\n\nMen from the United Party rose in anger, booing at him, raising their voices, but the speaker interrupted them. And the Boer kept speaking, more clearly now, overcoming the volume of his opponents, just as many in his own party rose to defend him and to counter their disapproving remarks.\n\n"I make it clear before you now! Realize that there is no way for this Parliament to keep on moving forward if it cannot listen to the calls of the people. I demand that a referendum be considered for the sake of our people! And if this is not put to consideration, every proposal set forth by this parliament shall be halted. This land is our land; this is the Volkstaat, and we are not slaves of any king or queen!"\n\nThe parliament burst with noise and the Boer returned to his seat, proud, as his party members shouted down the opposition, silencing them."

In the corners lit by street lamps, and on the highways free of traffic, the white citizens of South Africa, those who proudly call themselves the sons and daughters of those who endured the Great Trek, are, for once, free to show off their joy at a victory over the Anglos and the Africans.\n\nAlthough such a referendum may have a chance of failure, or of potential sabotage, it is nothing to neglect. The Boers had done it. And their enemies would have to shake their heads, sigh, and retreat into their homes. After all, as victory is celebrated, the streets of Suid-Afrika, the home of the supposedly noble Boers, witness vile acts in the dark.\n\nA scream of a prostitute here and there rings and fades.

The only thing we can do is to accept what comes after whatever choice we take.\n\nWe can consider supporting the ANC, including them gradually, as peaceably as we can, into our Dominion by listening to them. This would certainly win the more moderate and considerate members of that Congress, and as a consequence, it shall invite their kin to see us in a more favorable light and use their numerical majority to our advantage at the referendum, this would make us seem reasonable and approachable. However, this will inevitably provoke the Boers, especially those who follow Hertzog and cling to the promises of his party. It won't be good.\n\nOtherwise, we can establish a confrontation in opposition to the Congress and appeal to more conservative voters. This means concrete police, and possibly military, action against them. Arrests and raids would be made. And this would allow us to try removing from our land one threat from within and removing much of the National Party's appeal to law and order. The results however may not be so good. We must anticipate the possibility of these people rising against us, turning to violence, and pulling our nation down into anarchy.\n\nThe only thing we can do about it is to be careful, yet we must be quick about what choice we make. There is no time for us to waste, for not only are we facing down the shadows that haunt our Republic within, but we are also about to meet the challenge the Nazis to the north of our borders have.

Since then, the island has been home to a whaling station, a leper colony, a place to quarantine animals, and defensive fortifications in the Second World War. But it has always been regarded as a place to store troublesome chiefs, native leaders, and other political prisoners by its owners.\n\nRecently, it has become the new, permanent home to a number of radical prisoners. Daniels, Mandela, Mbeki, Mhlaba, Sisulu, Sobukwe, and others who are too much of a threat to society to be allowed to exist on the mainland wll be placed in the maximum security prison. Here, their visitors can be cut off, their mail stopped and regulated, their cell block isolated, their contact with the outside world shut. Their existence is reduced to their five square meter cell, their table, and the straw mat to sleep on. If they behave, they might be able to work in the quarry on the island, digging up lime."

Like a clockwork machine all three function synchronously to achieve some goal or another: Its leaders convene in smoke-filled rooms to discuss their ends and means; its grunts execute said means to their fullest extent; and its businessmen funnel part of their profit to propel themselves, their leaders, and their compatriot grunts further towards said ends.\n\nThe African National Congress is no different, but oftentimes perceptions fail to reflect the truth. One can easily see throngs of exuberant blacks waving banners of protest in television and on print, and the faces of the revolution they proclaim: Mandela, Tambo, Sobukwe. However, their pecuniary backbone escapes media attention save for reports on economic growth and the odd broken storefront. Ignored by many, these financiers are left free to support the petty insurrectionists wedging South Africa apart with millions of pounds -- blood money to the last shilling.\n\nTo deal with this clandestine threat, Commissioner du Plooy has suggested two approaches Sanctioning black and colored businessmen suspected of providing funding to the ANC, or blacklisting businesses vocal in their support for the National Party. Going straight after the Congress's wealthy benefactors may hurt it the most, but undertaking the latter will allow us some degree of plausible deniability and, perhaps, uproot paper trails leading straight to the Reich."

There are some within this government, si,. who wish to highlight the true face of the ANC."\n\nCalvin suddenly understood why this young man had been so nervous with his proposition.

He was an accountant, not a soldier, for God's sakes! "Is this a good personal defense weapon?"\n\nThe dealer laughed as he started loading the firearm. "It's a really good personal defense weapon, not for hunting tough, It wasn't made for Lions, Springbok but for game like the ANC. Here," he said, handing it over, "try putting a few rounds downrange, see how she handles."\n\nCaelan had taken a few shots before this, and knew the general idea of firearm safety. Don't point it at anything you don't mind losing, keep the fingers away from the gas ports, and treat it like it's loaded at all times. He flicked off the safety, and assumed a stance. With both hands, he aimed it at the center of the target and-damn, that was a huge kick!\n\nThe dealer laughed. "Well, at least you got it on the paper," he said. "Don't worry, you'll get used to it when you fire off a couple more." Seeing the distressed look on the customer's face, he said "If that was too much, we could go for a lighter round..."\n\n"No, this gun is alright," Caelan said, wanting to bring this to as quick a conclusion as possible. "Do you have some ammo for this?"\n\n"We have two varieties, pointed tip and hollow point. Now, the hollow points are more expensive, but you get what you pay for in terms of stopping power and the fact they don't go through walls and hurt people on the other side. I'm guessing that's a concern for you.\n\nCaelan nodded. "Three girls." he said.\n\n"Well, that settles it, then. How many boxes do you want?""

He thought about God and many things far beyond the understanding or comprehension of man.\n\nThe blast brought him back in the moment.\n\nShoving his wife's head down behind the pew as he took cover, he heard another one go off behind him, and another. This time with gunshots and horrified screams. Looking at the aisle, he saw many worshipers being hit with automatic fire, and another blast throwing up limbs, bodies, and splinters of wood from the destroyed pews.\n\nThe initial shock wore off, and he remembered that he had decided to take his snub nosed Model 10 to church today. Thankful for his foresight, he took it out, and peeked around the corner of the pew with it, hoping to use it to its fullest extent possible.\n\nSeveral Bantu were there, PAC, maybe, armed with assault rifles, which they were firing at the churchgoers. One threw a grenade, which explained the blasts. Piet knew his gun was not going to tip the odds in his favor, but he had to use it anyway. He started shooting, taking aim at one of the Africans.\n\nAmazingly, the sudden show of resistance panicked and sent the PAC running away. These weren't trained military, and they had no plan to deal with actual resistance other than to run like hell. Piet followed them as he reloaded, but only saw a car soom away as he got to the door. They had got away. But he had saved the church.\n\nBut he looked back, and saw the wounded, the dead, the maimed, and the ones that were going to die strewn about on the floor of the church.

"Well," said the militia leader, "you're going to purchase a rifle. Everybody in this outfit needs a rifle for when we go hunting Kaff, just like the Commandos back in the old days. It worked well against the Bantu then, so why not now? So get a mauser, preferably. And an automatic pistol, since you want to have firepower in an engagement. And maybe a shotgun for your house, in case someone breaks in for your television. Ammo?"\n\n"A box for the pistol," Calean said, trying to wrap his head around what he had just been told. Two new guns? Where would he put them? He was already scared to death that his daughters might get to his gun and accidentally discharge it. And now he was to get several more?\n\n"Not enough," said the militia leader disapprovingly, "you are going to want at least two hundred rounds per gun at all times. And do it fast, since I hear there's a shortage coming with everyone buying it. So do it when you go home tonight, understand?"\n\nCalean nodded. But he really didn't understand.

Of the thousands under the agency's payroll, he settled on JJ de Swardt's dossier. The captain was a rising star in the Bliksems, having earned his stripes fighting small flareups in Bechuanaland. Chops in counter-insurgency were worth their weight in all the Rand's gold to the Commissioner, and so he stamped the man's transfer to his new station with a new rank.\n\nNext, he picked a place for Major de Swardt's new HQ. South Africa has no shortage of dilapidated homesteads half-buried under the sand, only that a sharp eye catch their silhouettes among the bush. One eye spotted a complex 12 miles west of Pretoria. Fairly sizable, replete with provisions, and just far enough from civilization to stifle a scream with the open desert. De Plooy approved a second expedition into what the preliminary report called Vlakplaas Farm.\n\nLastly, he picked a name for its new inhabitants. Words in Afrikaans were struck out right off the bat; given the task force's nature, Afrikaans only added to caustic irony. Neither were words in Xhosa, Zulu, Bantu, and the country's thousand other native languages considered for the same reason.

And Oppenheimer was a master of organization, as he was the head De Beers Consolidated Mines. His position made him the king of mining in a country built on mining, and it wasn't a surprise that he was the richest man in South Africa. So he felt it was fitting when the South African government asked him to solve an organizational problem of their own.\n\nThe reason he was approached was that amongst his many philanthropic contributions towards education and Jewish causes, he had been supporting the African National Congress as well. His support of the ANC was tolerated because of his wealth and regular donations to the United Party. Now, his friends in the United Party wanted to meet his ANC friends, and Oppenheimer was the go-between.\n\nFirst, a phone call to his ANC contacts. The government was willing to negotiate, he said, and they wanted to discuss some changes that would calm the ANC down. Would the ANC be interested? And would there be a possibility that the head of the ANC, Mr. Tambo, could meet with the Prime Minister to discuss this in person? The ANC contact promised to get an answer, and he was called up a few hours later, saying that, yes, the ANC was willing to talk. Oppenheimer called up the government next, and gave them a phone number that they could use to talk directly with the ANC.\n\nBut then, the ANC contact called Oppenheimer and told him that negotiations had hit a snag. Since Tambo was still technically wanted for violating his banning order, there were concerns that he would be arrested at the meeting when he came out of hiding. Oppenheimer called up Graaff's office directly and informed them of the situation. A little while later, they gave him the assurances that if Tambo agreed to the meeting, they would revoke the banning order and let him avoid the charge."

Toward the southern end of the of KwaZulu and with over a thousand inhabitants, it was indistinguishable from the many other African villages in the area. Then, one day, a small group of South African Police showed up at the primary school and stood guard around the complex, accompanied by the mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer.\n\nSome ANC members talked with Oppenheimer for a bit, and the sound of helicopters filled the air. Two transport helicopters, marked in the colors of the South African Air Force, landed on the football green. Out came several plainclothes officers, a few staffers, and Prime Minister De Villiers Graaff. The ANC members were satisfied, and left with a police officer.\n\nThe leader of the ANC, Oliver Tambo, would later have to admit he did feel like this was a set-up. And it did seem ridiculous that this would really be taking place. But the assurances by the other members of the ANC that this was really happening convinced him. He left the safehouse on the edge of the village and went to the school, where he was allowed in after a brief search for weaponry by the guarding police officer.\n\nThe meeting between Tambo and Graaff took place in a schoolroom, with the desks formed to make a makeshift table. Several staffers for both sides were allowed in, as well, the Prime Minister's photographer to record the meeting, and Oppenheimer as a mediator. Negotiations were a bit awkward, at first, as neither side really trusted the other and expected a sudden ambush. Eventually, it became clear that both really did want to talk, and things got a bit more relaxed and calmer. And things got easier when Tambo and Graaff decided they really did want some of the same things.\n\nBy the time the meeting was over, substantial progress had been made. Graaff knew that the ANC would be willing to reduce violent and disruptive activity in exchange for concessions. Tambo knew that the government was now willing to meet with them on things, which was a lot better than when they were totally ignored.

Govan said 'this is where they put us in our own cell block."\n\n"Finally, the warden came out and spoke to us. He cleared his throat, and announced, 'the government of South Africa and the African National Congress have come to an agreement where the ANC will renounce violence as a political tool. As part of this deal, the ANC will no longer be judged to be in violation of the Suppression of Communism Act, and their members will no longer be prosecuted for their crimes. At 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, you will all be loaded onto a ferry for Cape Town, where you will be released. Thank you.'"\n\n"It was shocking, and we were unsure if it had truly happened. We spoke to the warden after the speech, who assured us that it was all true. Then we started asking questions. Everyone else could leave if their groups signed the deal, said the warden, but we were going to be leaving tomorrow. I asked him if I could have my release delayed to inform my family to meet me when I got out, and if I could be transported near them and released there.

To help persuade him, they allowed him to discuss it with the other PAC prisoners, who told Sobukwe that the ANC had signed the deal and had left the island. Many wanted to take the deal and leave the prison. But Sobukwe stood firm. There would be no cooperation with the government, he decided. As he observed his comrades in the PAC marching past him with the rest of the prisoners, he reflected on his decision and knew they would have to stay steadfast if they were to finally achieve victory.\n\nThen came the shock of his life.\n\nA prisoner in the middle of the group raised his hand. Several PAC prisoners were suddenly grabbed by prisoners behind them, covering their mouths so they could not be heard. Then out came the shivs, pieces of glass with cloth wrapped around the handle. Jaw agape, he watched his comrades go down in a fury of stabs and kicks. He started to yell, but none of that made a difference to the sudden orgy of violence that was transpiring outside of his residence. And he realized, to his horror, that the assailants were PAC members as well, the moderate ones who wanted to leave, and the victims were the ones who stood by him.\n\nWho did this, Sobukwe wondered? Did the ANC infiltrate the PAC? Was somebody making a play for party leader? Why aren't the guards watching this? Did the government want this to happen?\n\nSo fixated was Sobukwe on the inter-party coup on his hand mirror, he failed to notice the three prisoners that had climbed over his fence behind him."

Forget sending them into battle like it's Jelib again, you make these guys do some less glamorous work," Lansdale explained.

She witnessed the Second Boer War, the formation of the Union of South Africa, the First and the Second World Wars, and all the events in between. In the meantime, her village changed with the addition of new wood homes, a new schoolhouse with a generator, and more and more pressure on the residents, specifically the younger ones, to forget their past and traditions, and change their ways.\n\nNesiwe has been living with her son's family ever since her husband passed away. Not content to sit around the living room and stare at the wall, she took to telling stories to the children of the household who were too young for school or to work. The children told their friends, and soon the village children would go to the house to listen to her stories. Stories of old Xhosa heroes and legends, ones that she was told as a child, and ones he was dismayed to find the young ones had a lack of familiarity with.\n\nThen one day, one of the white teachers in the village sought her out. He told her that the government had decided to start teaching Xhosa, Zulu, and various other native languages, instead of just English and Afrikaans. This was due to the recent reforms to placate native groups. The only problem was there was a lack of white teachers who could speak Xhosa, necessitating the recruiting of elderly natives who could handle teaching duties. She fit the qualifications, and she could speak and write in English, thanks to a missionary who once visited the village when she was a child. Would she consider becoming a language teacher in the village school?\n\nNow, Nesiwe is a Xhosa language teacher. She teaches children how to read and write in the language of their ancestors. She helps her son's family with an extra source of income. And, most importantly, she still tells the children of the village the stories that have been passed down for generations of Xhosa.

The driver immediately left the scene to contact the authorities.\n\nWhen the farmer led the police to the scene, they found it exactly as he described it. By the looks of it, the victim was shot in the head at close range once with a .380 inch bullet. The driver-side window had been opened, and the car was in between the lane lines, indicating the vehicle had been stopped before the murder, and the assassin had come from the side. The victim was missing their wallet, and their identification. But one officer recognized the deceased, and the victim's surprising identity was soon confirmed.\n\nBalthazar Johannes "B. J." Vorster was born to a sheep farmer in Jamestown, South Africa in 1915. Becoming involved in politics during his years studying law, he had been a member of the pro-Nazi organization Ossewabrandwag during the war, an affiliation which earned him a detention at Koffiefontein. Claiming to have a newfound belief in the parliamentary system, he was elected as a National Party candidate for the National Assembly, before becoming a senator. Known for being able to be approachable, eccentric, and occasionally reasonable, he was nonetheless comitted to Boer nationalism and the implementation of racial segregation.\n\nNobody knew who ended his life on that road.

No cartridges were found on the ground, nor were there any fingerprints on the car or the body. A tire track was discovered on the side of the road, but that may have been unrelated.

Once the judges who would hear the case were identified, the courting could begin.\n\nIt was obvious that one of the judges would rule the way they wanted. They had a case history and opinions that pointed to a view that suited the United Party. Thus, they were ignored completely, since they were confident they could rule the way they wanted. There were bigger concerns.\n\nThe second judge was a little vaguer on the side they supported. They had some opinions that looked good for the outcome, but had some that didn't. A private conversation, however, gave plenty of confidence that they would rule favorably for the side they wanted. So now they had two.\n\nThe third was the toughest. They had doubts about the merits of the case, and wanted to rule against it. This couldn't happen under any circumstances. It took a long time, with plenty of conversations, but they were finally convinced of its merit. A new courthouse in their hometown being named after them would be officially unrelated.\n\nThe fourth was a judge that was favorable to the side the government wanted. They weren't on the case originally, but some strings were pulled, and they got on. Mostly to make sure they were covered if any of the other three went back on their word.\n\nSo when the Appellate division met in Bloemfontein to decide on voting rights for natives, the United Party could relax a large amount.

The hostage-takers lacked heavy weaponry, and were extremely disorganized. And they had been so kind as to put a major breach in the fence. So while the negotiators tried to bore them to death, the police made a plan...\n\nThe first step was the moving of a fire truck and a group of police officers near the front of the building. This made the Boers move towards the front to prepare for the expected attack. Meanwhile, groups of armed police gathered in the building behind the court. Under the watchful eye of sharpshooters, a group of welders cut away a section of the fence to get another point of entry.\n\nAs soon as the go-ahead was given, grenade launchers filled the building with tear gas as the police went in. A large number went through the hole in the fence, while a larger number went through the breach in the fence created by the van. Snipers went to work, shooting at the paramilitaries when they popped up in the windows.\n\nA few minutes after the breach, the hostages were being led out and forced to lie on the grass as they were checked for weapons. They were scared, but unharmed, even the judges. Several of the Boers were down, the rest were captured. A few injuries to the police force, but no fatalities. All in all, a successful operation."

That came easily enough. But then came time to try to get them to leave. And then things snagged. Their demands were too much. And they wouldn't come quietly.\n\nThe next step was the raid. Overwhelm them with police officers and extreme force. Get the hostages out, and arrest whoever was left. That was the plan. In actuality, it was a disaster. The Boers were too heavily armed, far more than had been expected, far better than the attacking police. It was a pitched battle, and when it was over, the police retreated under a white flag, carrying their casualties, while the Vierkleur stood tall, taunting them.\n\nThe police lost their leverage. The army, under General Magnus Malan, was now in charge. After negotiation, it appeared both sides weren't interested in continuing the fighting. The Boers could leave if they left the judges alone. And the paramilitaries accepted. The Afrikaners released the hostages, and marched out of the city with their firearms, in formation, and with their heads held high parading with their Vierkleur right on the noses of South Africa's soldiers and policemen.\n\nIt was the most shameful moment in the history of the South African Police."

A citadel carved from stone to praise God and the race He had conceived, and for which He has great plans in mind. It is the greatest symbol his kind had ever built -- and if those fools in the Cape had their way, Albert added with a grimace, a symbol as lost to history's dunes as poor Ozymandias.\n\nHe'd read the reports before he visited. A string of coincidences from the SAP: innocent Boers detained, peaceful Boer homes raided, law-abiding Boer businesses ransacked. Law and order has swept South Africa... but not on its true malcontents. No, that ignoble attention went to his people, and his people alone. They've suffered enough, Albert decided.\n\nSo he ambled out of the Voortrekker Monument, nearing a telephone box by the side. The Boer dialed a number and gave his orders: several million pounds' worth of "vital equipment" from "the usual sources" and to "the usual channels". Funds were wired and hands shook over the telephone. Then he hung up.\n\nGraaff had played his hand. Now the NP shall play theirs."

Is that all?"\n\n"Yes, that's all."\n\n"Alright then." remarked the man, returning to the back room presumably to prepare his food.\n\nAs he waited, Paki glanced at the wall, noticing the multitude of posters plastered on it. "Only the National Party can save you from those black demons!", "Vote for the National Party to help stamp out the coloured menace!" and "Watch out for these dark men! Place your trust in the National Party and safeguard yourself!" were written on those posters, coupled with pictures of violent scenes of murder, theft, and rape, all containing shots of colored people. He eyed the photos, aghast at the imagery displayed.\n\n"Ah, the good old NP, always preaching" started the old man, who returned with Paki's food.\n\n"They've always been a stir, convincing people that people like you should be kicked out of here. Their boys came into my shop and asked to plaster their propaganda, and I obliged. Doesn't mean I like them though." chuckled the old man.\n\n"Why did you allow them then?" asked Paki.\n\n"They pay me to post it here, and they pay good." scoffed the man. He looked at Paki for a moment. "Of course, you don't discriminate in business." he quickly added.\n\nWith that, Paki began to consume his food as reflected on his exchange with that white man. As Paki exited the shop he waved to the owner, showing a sign of goodwill. As he trotted along the streets leading to his house, he saw more posters of the same nature, which distressed him slightly. Then he thought about the future, or, his people's future for that matter. The NP weren't fond of his kind, so he didn't want to imagine what they'd do to him if they passed by him. He sighed, wishing it would all roll over soon and he could enjoy his life peacefully. He'd hate to see his beloved Cape town ruined by those "National Party" folk."

He didn't realize something eventful would happen that day.\n\nAs he was reading the local news, Johann heard thumping noises, loud and numerous, coming from the main road to the provisional government building. Such sounds piqued his interests, which led him far from the confines of his house to a large gathering of about a few hundred people. He quickly planted himself among the onlookers to observe the occasion. He saw boards carried by many, painted with symbols depicting broken crowns, inscribed on it "Down with the Queen! Long live the Republic!"\n\nHe heard the men and women chant violently "The United Party is weak and frail, they cannot save us from the Germans nor the Blacks! We, the National Party, are your only hope!"\n\nThe audience began to cry out in response "Down with the monarchies, down with the tyrants! Up with the Republic!"\n\nSuch rousing cheers from the audience displayed to Johann that he had found himself at one of the many rallies by the National Party, surrounded by crazed fanatics. He realized it as his curiosity faded, replaced by growing disappointment.\n\n"Another one?" said Johann "They always stir up the folk around here."\n\nHe began to turn away to return to his cozy adobe when the crowd started to move behind the protestors, dragging Johann along into a sea of white."

They moved towards the spot, hauling their equipment with them. Once they got to the center, they set up their booth. After that, they spoke into their megaphones and handed out pamphlets to nearby passersby, to which they received cold reception and stony stares from the local folk. "See? It's working. Looks like we're doing fine so far!" joked Frederick with a cheerful expression painted on his face.\n\nA stone flew, colliding with Friedrick's face, causing him to stagger and collapse onto the booth. His fellow accomplices attended to him worriedly, examining the damage in a hurried daze. It was a medium-sized scratch, flowing with blood and staining the dirt below with a crimson tint. As Anna and Robert pulled out bandages to cover the wound, John stood between them and the crowd, enforcing their distance. "Which one of you threw that stone?" asked John in an authoritative tone. He wasn't one to talk much, but the anger he felt from seeing his friend injured pushed him over the edge. He repeated it again, louder this time "Who threw the stone at Friedrich?" No one answered him. "I said, who threw that stone!" yelled John, insulted by the silence.\n\n"I did." shouted an old man. "You people aren't appreciated in these parts. We stand by our loyal brethren, who pledge to make South Africa a better place!

Scram!" screamed the old man, stamping his cane on the ground. The crowd started to murmur and began to close around John and his group. "No more crown! No more kings!" chanted the people, drawing closer and closer, shouting louder each time. John and the others huddled in a tight ring, trying their best to keep each other safe. Anna began to break down at the sight of the encroaching mob. John tried to keep his calm demeanor, but his eyes began to water and his face gripped with fear."

What plenty remains have been reserved for guns, tanks and ammunition for ten million fastened belts. For a nation under siege, butter is indulgent excess at best, and treason at worst.\n\nOf course, that does not mean special occasions no longer warrant a bit of celebration under the current stresses. Far from it. What it does imply, however, is that Her Majesty the Queen's loyal soldiers needed only the humble tea kettle -- and some special ingredients -- to commemorate the day of her birth.\n\nFavors were exchanged among the quartermasters beforehand such that their well-oiled trucks delivered crates of Twinings and creamy milk, rather than rifle rounds and oil, to Commonwealth formations across the front. More specific requests varied among the realms: the Canadians, for instance, ordered an extra bag of English breakfast for every beaver in uniform. West Indiemen detachments asked for generators to power their fancy iceboxes for brewing cold tea. The ANZACs demanded gallons of the freshest Norco Cape Town receives from the Antipodes. South Africa asked for medical supplies and spare parts, the killjoys; then again, they accepted the honeybush bags as eagerly as they do bottles of Betadine.\n\nYet in spite of their myriad differences and quarrels -- regiments heckled each other and themselves over whether to add milk before the tea or the converse -- every last Commonwealth tar listened to Earl Cameron announcing the Queen's thirty-sixth birthday on CBC Radio.

Then they had seen the column of black, billowing from a patch of green near the abandoned Weipe border post. The chopper touched down, and the squad stepped out, staring at the gruesome sight.\n\nThere was a humble low-slung main house, made of stone and wood, accompanied by a couple of tiny shacks and a pen of goats. Flames poured from the house, the shacks had clearly been picked over, and what goats hadn't been taken lay bayoneted in the grass.\n\nAlong with the family.\n\nTheir remains lay in front of the house, the youngest son still clutching an Afrikaans Bible in his ruined arms.

Once her oaths had been taken, the Archbishop presented her with the holy bible, and prepared for the most sacred part of the ritual.\n\nThe Queen, who up until that point had still been referred to as "Princess Elizabeth," since she was still technically a princess, went to sit in the Governor-General's chair for her anointing. She was presented with the Armills, Stole Royal, Robe Royal and the Sovereign's Orb, followed by the Queen's Ring, the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove.

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal things came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and fire rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from their bodies. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any ancient warmaster or khan. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. He made a signal and the helicopters left back through the smoke, blasting their music as they left the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten."

Mason's was not -- which was cause for the panic bubbling within him. He had forgotten to maintain his locker to the inspection standard today, and by the time he realized such he was out of time. Labored breaths left the grunt's chest as he dreaded the instructor's inevitable reprisal.\n\n"He's coming!" whisper-shouted a platoon mate as a lone figure approached the cabin door. Mason's eyes joined several dozen pairs in fixing the riveted metal abyss with rigid stares. The boy felt his heart hammer against his throat.\n\nThen the door burst open, revealing Corporal Vosloo's no-nonsense frown come to ruin their already short spirits. "Platoon! Attention!" the Corporal barked.\n\nIn unison, they stomped their heels together and stood ramrod stiff. The instructor paced from bed to bed, searching meticulously for every flaw one can imagine and then some. Mason could do nothing but stare ahead, though his ears caught the increasingly loud shouting -- first for a dusty bed frame, then stained floor tiles the next, and so on. Finally, the Corporal stood in front of Mason's own bunk. Beads of sweat poured out from the boy's every pore as he did his best to tamper his breath.\n\n"What the hell do you take me for, Private Turner?" screamed the Corporal, in his pronounced Afrikaner accent. "A moron?!"\n\n"N-no. No Corporal!" replied Mason quaveringly.\n\n"Turn and look closely Private!"\n\nMason snapped back around.

Riflemen tossed their kits aside and prepared for contact.\n\nContact came as bursts of machine gun fire from the steep plateau hill, raining steel down the disorganized column. In the confusion, men struggled to discern the direction of gunfire until shouts began to echo. "In the hills! Get behind the trucks! It's coming from the hills!" men screamed, as they scrambled to take cover where cover was found -- rocks, trucks, brush. Mason quickly followed suit. Drivers, in a frenzy, dove out of their trucks to take cover from the hail of bullets.

The day began like any other: Taps at five o'clock, heli maintenance at seven, and border patrols until noon. With the exception of some GIs catching bullets in an unlucky firefight, the morning patrols were dull and boring. Up until that one morning, at least. Nothing could have prepared them for what happened then.\n\nHorseshoe had just touched down in Cape Town for refueling and resupply when the distress call came through the comms. Couple American squads, ambushed as they chased a column of SS all the way to Namibia. Brass dispatched them for medevac; everyone else was too far away or otherwise engaged. As the helicopter sped towards the border, another panicked alert from the ground reported only four men returning fire. Spirter cocked his M60 as they approached the LZ.\n\nThis was his first true test as a door gunner since his enlistment. Dad saw democracy fall in Europe; he swore to keep it alive in South Africa any way he could. So when the cluster of friendlies rose from the dunes and bullets peppered the Huey's sides, Spirter delivered burst after burst of .50 caliber fire at the dozens of Afrika SS below. That shut them up quick right as they landed and pulled the wounded out of the fighting.\n\nHe thought he saw war for the first time then, when the desperate Americans packed their limbless, wailing squadmates onto every free space Horseshoe had. The flight back home was as tense as a room cramped with fifteen war-torn men can be -- up until one of the wounded asked for a Zippo.

Some of them had been administered to the corpses littered about the street corner outside.

The elders had thus called their vantage in the land a blessing... but now, as the two eagles of West and North waged war, Lephale's blessing has become a curse.\n\nThe Boers came first. They took the village's goods despite their owners' protestations, cursed the "savages" who dared to resist, and left behind a garrison of armed men. Some left to seek redress in a nearby town, never to return. A few crept off to join their rebel brethren, take an eye for their lost tooth, but most stayed put. Life went on.\n\nNext came the Americans. The Boers fled before they arrived; to sate their disappointment, the new white men captured Lephale's remaining elders for "collaboration" and handed out bars of chocolate. A headstrong young man dared to speak out against their captors' unfair exchange, receiving a rifle butt to the face for his troubles. Some talked of fleeing to safer ground, but most stayed put. The white men will leave as they had before. Life went on.\n\nLast came the Germans. They wore black uniforms, skull-capped medals and cold faces. They took all that was left and ordered every man who can carry a gun onto the village center. Old and young cowered in their huts when they heard three distinct sounds: first, shouts in an alien tongue. Then gunshots. Then screaming.\n\nDays passed before the survivors emerged to gather their fathers and sons. Sapped of their strength, the survivors stayed put, and slept, and wept. Only the specter of famine forced them back to their farms and herds.

After what felt like an hour of digging, Isaac finally caught the pilot within. He looked even younger than Isaak, maybe, but he was covered in too much blood, sand and glass to tell.\n\nIsaak shattered the cockpit with a solid kick and grabbed the poor boy by the shoulders.

Afrikaans would have to do for communication. "Nee," he said, "ek is Suid-Afrikaans. Uh... soek jy 'n sigaret?" The German nodded, and Isaak handed him a lit cigarette from his pocket pack. Gazing into the west as the sun set beneath a dune, he said, "Wirst du mich töten?" Isaak didn't understand him, so he shrugged. The German sighed, dragging his thumb across his throat in a cutting motion. "O," he said, not sure of the boy's proposition, "il jy hê ek moet?"\n\nThe boy definitely didn't understand the words, but he seemed to get the meaning. "Oh, noch nicht," he said, shaking his head, "Ich möchte zuerst den Sonnenuntergang beobachten." So the two boys watched the sun set over the Namib, the sky flaring into hues of orange then red then purple then blue. As the stars came the German passed, like a ripple on a silent sea."

Bodies strewn about, half-eaten by swarms of maggots and flies. Walls and floor stained with dark crimson splatters. A prison cell's stone grey walls and bars. "Anyone there?" he called out. Then his left arm stung, drawing a piercing shriek on his lips and memories from his mind. A battle with those filthy Boers and their Kraut friends. A blast to the side, shrapnel digging into his skin, screaming- and black and nothing else.\n\nThe door swung open as if on cue, revealing three men with batons. "Hello Adriaan," said one with false cheer. "Glad to see you're awake."\n\nCheer faded as a frown took its place. "Now face the wall."\n\nIn one hard swing, the blackjack struck Adriaan's back with a resounding crack. The prisoner yelled as he slumped a bloody heap on the bloody floor. Another swing, directly behind his head, and Adriaan saw black again.\n\nHe woke up the next day to haze on his vision and blistering sores stabbing at his every bit of skin. Hair stood on end as a baton struck the cell's iron bars. The three officers had returned, this time with a bowl of pap, smiles wide as they regarded his hobble towards the bowl. A baton swatted his hand away as it reached for food, cracking finger bone and drawing another bloody scream. Pap fell to the blood- and dirt-smeared floor with a wet smack.\n\nAdriaan stared into his captors' soulless eyes. His flashed for mercy the German bastards would never give him -- like a dying mouse toyed by cats before they descend for the feast.\n\nAs he slipped into black a third time, Adriaan knew he will never leave his cell."

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.7.desc:0 ""For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty."\n\n"As a forward air controller, Capt. Wilbanks was pilot of a light reconnaissance aircraft conducting patrols near Pretoria when he received a distress signal from Capts. Benjamin Buckley and William Havelock. His immediate decision to enter their proximity revealed a numerically superior hostile force poised to surround the crash site of a Huey gunship. The Boer force, realizing that Capt. Wilbanks' discovery had compromised their position and ability to launch a surprise attack, immediately fired on the small aircraft with all available firepower. Meanwhile, they began encroaching upon the crash site while pinning Capts. Buckley and Havelock down with small arms fire from all sides."\n\n"Realizing that air rescue elements cannot arrive in time to evacuate the stranded pilots, and despite cognizance of both the limitations of his lightly armed, lightly armored aircraft and the enemy's overwhelming firepower, Capt. Wilbanks immediately assumed a covering, close support role. Flying through a hail of withering fire at treetop level, Capt. Wilbanks deterred the Boers' advance first with a salvo of white phosphorus rockets, then with rifle fire from the side window of his aircraft. Despite increasingly intense antiaircraft fire, Capt. Wilbanks continued to disregard his own safety and made repeated low passes over the enemy to divert their fire away from the crash site. His daring tactics allowed a rescue helicopter to successfully enter the combat zone and extract Capts. Buckley and Havelock to safety. During his final courageous attack to protect the withdrawing helicopter, Capt. Wilbanks was mortally wounded and his bullet-riddled aircraft crashed onto Boer lines."\n\n"Capt. Wilbanks' magnificent action saved two fellow pilots from certain injury or death. His unparalleled concern for his fellow man and his extraordinary heroism were in the highest traditions of the military service, and have reflected great credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force."\n\n--Medal of Honor citation for Captain Hilliard A.

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.8.desc:0 ""My mother raised me proper, as she used to call it - she said I'd never be like the boys who teased me at school for being from the poorer end of South Central, because I'd been raised to be better than them. Funny how that changed once I joined the Army, but I like to think of myself as a man of words, not of fists. At least, not when I'm off duty. Never expected to get myself into a situation like this, at any rate - I have three siblings at home, Lord knows I've built patience for each of them."\n\n"But those South Africans? Man, I thought dealing with my own brothers was an annoyance, but when I was off duty - I swear I was more on edge than in the damn foothills. There ain't nothing like finding out your own men got a tighter set of lips on them than the people you're trying to help. Listen, I know you're recording to try to document this - I just wanna say that I ain't trying to - uh - stereotype the whole damn country, it's just that - they got some Uncle Tomfoolery goin' on in there."\n\n"Hell, the reason I got in a scuffle - hope I held my own in there - was, well, I was trying to get a light on some R and R, in a coastal town I'd been rotated to, and I met soldiers from the 45th Battalion, S.A.A.F. I'd fought with them - well, my unit'd fought with them - for 3 months. I thought they'd recognize me for my tab when I hit them up for a light."\n\n"And you know what they told me? They pointed to the damn Zulu soldiers down the street and told me this part of town was - well - whites only. Damn the Afrikaans to hell - I didn't come here fighting stupid lily-white powderboys so I could get lip from them off-duty."\n\n"And I don't regret what I did next, either - I'm Recon, remember? Learnt Zulu as part of translation duties. I'm damn glad I did, too. The look on those Zulu faces - I should've lit my cigarette with that. Heh! And they say black skins hide the heart...""

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.9.desc:0 "Dear teacher, my last vacation was not the way I thought it would be. On one Saturday, my mother woke me up really early in the morning, I argued with her, as I wished to sleep more but she told me to pick up my backpack and fill it with clothes because the Afrikaners were coming to hurt us and we must flee. I didn't understand it, Mr. Christiaan from the bakery is Afrikaner and he always treated me very kindly, if those Afrikaners are as nice as Mr. Christiaan, why should we run from them? But them father told me she was wrong, we are not running from anyone, we are going in a train trip to the Sea.\n\nThe Train was very crowded, and many people looked very scared. Some were crying, including my mother, but my father took me to the window and sat there with me watching the view. We saw many wonderful animals, many springboks and gazelles, we even saw a lion! I had some pleasant dreams that night dreaming of the Sea.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Cape everyone was smiling, we were finally going to leave the train, I was really anxious to finally see the Sea for the first time, I looked out of the window and there was a mass of people waiting for us, maybe they would prepare a welcome party. But then a man climbed on a bench and spoke to the crowd " These Kaffirs won't come off in our Station " and everybody started yelling and spitting at us, calling us dirty animals, I don't know why. One of them threw a rock at the train windows, hitting my face. I started crying when I saw my blood on the rock and then my father gave me a strong hug, telling me everything will be fine, that very moment the train started moving again and we escaped the angry people\n\nWhen the train stopped, we finally arrived in the camp my father promised us, I've have never camped before so I was very happy, but I still have to get used to sleeping on the floor, it's so much harder than on a bed. These were my vacations, teacher, I like camping..."

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.10.t:0 "Ghosts of the Jungle"
 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.10.desc:0 "The arrival of the Australian contingent to the OFN's South African "advisor" group was treated as something of an after thought both by American planners and their Afrika-Schild counterpart. Australia's small army was not expected to contribute much more than help in stabilizing the front line. Its small special force command would equally be helpful in supporting American operations.\n\nThis perception of the men from down under proved entirely inadequate. Boer insurgents in conflict zones found themselves stalked by Australian commandos. African SS divisions walking into contested territories would be repelled not by the industrial might of the American bomber fleet, but by ambushes, sabotage and misdirection. German officers that initially cursed the cowardice of their African underling soon grew to fear the shadows where any number of Australian infantrymen might be hiding.\n\nThe lessons learned by Australia in the waning days of the Pacific war in the jungles of southeast Asia are proving their relevance to modern conflicts. Faced with the Japanese onslaught and faltering help from the United Kingdom at the time, Australian commanders learned to do more with less. Information gathering was often left to company level officers, encouraging cooperation with local leaders. In effect, many Australian companies operate as extremely well equipped insurgencies.\n\nDespite interest and analysis by both sides of the conflict, the strategies of the Australian army are not a panacea. Having been developed as a method to compensate for Australia's smaller army and industry, these methods do not help the OFN much in holding vast amounts of territory. Nor have the Australians found as much cooperation from African locals than from south east Asians dreading Japanese troops. But the Aussie's grit and courage have certainly added to the Schild's misery in the sectors they share."
