USA_wal64_roll_back_segregationist_rhetoric_desc:0 "As much as we want to claim the pride and happiness in our administration's successes, one thing stands as clear as daylight: the people of America stand broken, divided, and at each other's throats. Whether we like it or not, the country would be damned if we continued to wedge a divide, as it will only serve to promote more outrage and disunity, even if taking action has been our greatest weapon in our successes. Thus, in our knowledge in the impossibility of America's success without even a crumb of stability, we must roll back some of our more outlandish statements regarding our policies of segregation. Although our support base will become more confused over the official they voted for, like hell would we allow the nation to break apart more than it already has and stop any process of healing. Besides, no matter what, we will continue to stand up for the states' rights against the federal government, even if we have to smother some of the flames."

His electoral mandate was simple: Repeal Nixon's intolerable act at all costs. Now it's time for Wallace to make good on his promise to the American people, he is about to undo the terrible damage that Johnson, Kennedy, Nixon, King, and all these domestic "civil rights" terrorists have done to the American way of life.\n\nPresident Wallace will start drafting the American National Traditions Reservation Act. This act will repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1962, as well as provide timetables and procedures for Southern states to begin re-segregating and, if we have chosen such a path, for Northern states to introduce segregation. We will also implement full segregation in federal institutions and push towards segregation in the armed forces. It will also give police departments a broad range of powers to enforce segregation. But first, we must secure enough support in the Senate to get this bill to Wallace's desk, and some campaigning and compromise may be necessary..."

He will tell Boston housewives that his act will keep their children from being bussed to Black schools, tell Michigan auto workers that he'll keep Blacks from taking their unionized jobs, and tell well-to-do New York suburbanites that without ANTRA, it'll be "there goes the neighborhood" in no time.

You mark my words, pass ANTRA and it'll save your life!"\n\nWallace will dial his law-and-order rhetoric up to 11.

The Black Panthers are already using force of arms to terrorize the good people of Los Angeles, and it's only a matter of time till they're emboldened to torch Watts and the whole city with it.

If the average citizen has been unable to convince their congressmen to see that, then we may have to bring in the professionals.\n\nPresident Wallace will flood Congress with the finest lobbyists money can buy.

But President Wallace is a forgive-and-forget Christian; if the Democrats want to repent of their obstinance and support ANTRA, then he will make sure their seats are secure.\n\nPresident Wallace will encourage governors to ruthlessly enforce the rigged literacy tests that keep Black Americans away from the polls. Democratic Congressmen will be informed that another so-called Freedom Summer will see them thrown out of the capitol, and this fact will hopefully inspire them to vote for ANTRA."

If Blacks have no business using the same theater entrances or cemeteries as White people, they can hardly expect to use the same polling stations as their paler compatriots. And should their polling booths be inaccessible, that's hardly our problem.\n\nPresident Wallace will step up his efforts against Black voters. The Black polling stations could be two hours away from their homes and located within a condemned building, but if they can't make it there to vote, that's their fault.

He, personally, has done more for the Negro than any other individual. Our efforts are keyed to a fight to preserve Constitutional Government and States' Sovereignty – not to hurt our Negro citizens. White and colored have lived together in the South for generations in peace and equanimity. They each prefer their own pattern of society, their own churches and their own schools – which history and experience have proven are best for both races. All these troubles we're having lately are precisely because of outside fascist-influenced agitators like the so-called Reverend King, the NAACP, the ACLU and all the Japanazi moneyed interests backing them. That ends here and now!\n\n President Wallace will launch Operation Defending Freedom, an FBI offensive that will arrest and detain major subversive leaders in surgical strikes from Coast to Coast. MLK, James Farmer, Roy Wilkins, Abraham Heschel, Gus Hall, Bobby Seale, anyone on Wallace's blacklist. Obviously, they can't be charged with anything that will stick, but detaining them for a while will hinder their ability to instigate Black voters in the elections. Democrats should certainly be grateful for our efforts to secure their seats and will be more poised to support ANTRA."

'From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.'\n\nIn 1964 the American people confirmed an immortal truth: That the separation of the races is a God-given mandate to mankind. It was not President Wallace who first put up signs saying, "Whites Only" and "Coloreds Only", it was our Father in Heaven. No one, not the God-hating fascists in Germany and Japan, the tyrants on the Supreme Court, the spineless atheists in Congress nor the Satanic Burgundians and liberal elites funding them can erase what God has decreed. The Civil Rights Act is ready to be melted down like a modern Golden Calf, and America will return to God and the way of life that He ordained.

All of Wallace's preparations to secure the repeal of the CRA shall be tested. If it passes, Wallace will cement his legacy as the savior of the South.

It cannot be said enough: Without its unflinching dedication to free markets and free enterprise, our nation will have been consigned to a footnote in the annals of history long ago.\n\nAs a new President enters the White House, so too must America chart a new course for its economy. For thinking men such as you and I, there exists only one option: Promote American business, at home and abroad, whatever the cost.

This arrangement, enforced by American companies, saw everyone involved become rich beyond their wildest dreams as they together fed America and the world with millions of tons of delicious, nutritious bananas. Sadly, this fruitful relationship never fully recovered from the Great Depression, and the Second World War put to rest any hopes that it may be revisited in the near future.\n\nOne near future later, and things are starting to look up. We now have the means to reassert our position in Central America for the first time in thirty years. Our leverage may have atrophied, but we still have contacts to visit, old favors to call. Tell the State Department to spread the word far and wide: America's coming back for its bananas, and this time we're here to stay."

USA_wal64_the_banana_republics_desc:0 "One of the most basic principles any businessman worth his salt follows is to "buy low and sell high". The more dollars you earn with every dollar you spend, the better. Raw materials have the benefit of being easy enough to extract with unskilled labor, while at the same time in high enough demand to command hundreds of dollars per unit in the world market. This is why some countries base their entire economies on one such resource and become tremendously wealthy in doing so -- be it with oil, gold, diamonds, or in Central America's case, bananas.\n\nBy signing trade agreements with the region's "banana republics", our businessmen can gain access to the fruit at bargain prices and sell them to a market willing to pay much, much higher for them. They get steep profits, Americans get delicious bananas, the local caudillos get revenue with which to buy more farmland and plant more bananas, and the federal government gets hefty sums of cash from the taxes pegged to every transaction throughout the whole chain -- a win-win scenario for everyone involved, in other words."

Such measures will have the twofold effects of multiplying production by orders of magnitude within the next ten years and granting Americans to a much larger share thereof."\n\nBeneath the polite, technical language, however, the message was clear: America's largest fruit companies have heard about our plans for Central America, and they want in -- preferably with federal aid money to buy off the farmland for themselves. Lucky for them, corporate cooperation is exactly what we need."

From there they are loaded in crates to massive, freshly-painted cargo ships, which then deliver the beans to coffee shops and stores the world over.\n\nIn the decades since its introduction, coffee has arguably grown to occupy a special place in the American lifestyle. Much like the Englishman and his tea, many Americans drink coffee as part of a daily ritual, one which they can arguably no longer live without. It can hardly be denied that normal business would grind to a halt in the absence of coffee; thus, it's important that we gain as much control over its sources as we can.\n\nIf that means nabbing half a country's economy from under its nose, then so be it."

In such a state of affairs did Guatemala's true suzerain reach unprecedented heights, making record profits off the production and export of Guatemala's most valuable crop, harvested by the Guatemalan people.\n\nThen they decided enough was enough and staged an insurgency. A few severed heads express mailed to the company's headquarters later, and United Fruit left the country in disgrace.\n\nNow that we've decided to allocate more resources towards expanding our influence in Central America, United Fruit claimed they can participate a little more directly in bringing Guatemala back to the fold.

We will stay true to our words, and give the states the rights they want by allowing them to decide upon the issue of segregation of the states' education system themselves. That way, the American people have a choice in their decision without the influence of the federal government to bog down the progress of the American individual."

That way, we are in no way betraying our value of states' rights, but also allowing the opposition of segregation to earn their right as well.

################################################### THURMOND
POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "Many expected Far-Right NPP leader James Strom Thurmond to one day become president. None could have predicted the extraordinary circumstances which ultimately lead him to the Oval Office.\n\nBorn to wealthy and landed Southern gentry, Thurmond quickly developed a keen political acumen. His legal education, stellar military service, and extensive connections led him to become Governor and later a Senator of South Carolina. Staunchly segregationist, he led the exodus of Southern senators from the Democratic Party in the wake of Brown v Board. As a leader of George Patton's Patriot Party, he successfully arranged the merger with the National Progressive Front and founded the modern National Progressive Party in 1957. Despite failing to win the Presidential election of 1960, he remained a major political leader and was President Pro Tempore of the Senate when Bobby Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey were assassinated.\n\nFor reasons still unknown, the Speaker of the House refused the office of the Presidency, and the line of succession then fell on President Thurmond. His long-held ambitions on the White House having finally been realized, Thurmond presides over a nation in turmoil. While he has pledged to uphold the late President Kennedy's legacy, many fear he is plotting to destroy everything the progressive president stood for in order to remake America in his twisted, white supremacist image.\n\nWith the clock ticking down to the next election, the King takes his place on the board and begins his moves."

That's precisely why I'm calling. You're next in line for the Oval Office in the wake of this tragedy. And I'd like to say, as a colleague and as a friend, that you should reconsider accepting the offer."\n\n"First off, you're not my friend you far-right fuck. Second, who are you to tell-"\n\n"Tell? Hopefully I'm not going to have to tell anyone anything. But if you were to be sworn in, it would be my duty as a public servant to inform the public of matters that would make the President unfit for the dignity of his-"\n\n"The fuck are you trying to pull here?"\n\n"The American people deserve better than a man who does the kind of unnatural, immoral, and disgusting acts which you commit in motels on a regular basis. Motels you checked into with an assumed name, alongside some unsavory men. Motels whose curtains you had conveniently forgotten to close, where certain onlookers might have been inclined to take truly unsightly photographs. We do deserve better than such a man, don't you agree?"\n\n"..."\n\n"I'll take that as a yes. Good call."\n\n"I'm not the disgusting one here, Thurmond. You are. Whole goddamn country will learn that firsthand as soon as you take office."\n\n"Your country thanks you for making the right choice."\n\n"Fuck you, Strom."\n\n*click*"
 strom.1.a:0 "One day can change everything"

 strom.2.t:0 "Setting Up the Board"
 strom.2.desc:0 "The first few days were a sombre matter. As the nation mourned their lost president, President Thurmond found himself quietly meeting with the party upper crust to handle the formal matters of his succession. Meeting after meeting saw terse discussion between himself and the wary remnants of Bobby's coalition, who saw him as a threat to everything the young Kennedy had worked for.\n\nIf he was to accomplish anything, Thurmond realized, these idealists would all have to go.\n\nFirst he would need a Vice President to serve at his side. A brief assessment of candidates would provide him the obvious answer. Maxwell Taylor, distinguished former air force martial, dignified military advisor to the US government for at least a decade and, most crucially of all, a notorious rubber stamp and yes man to whoever was in charge. Thurmond saw two excellent qualities in Taylor - he was apolitical enough to avoid disgusting Bobby's old clique, and servile enough to do whatever the hell he wanted him to. Plus his military background would no doubt appeal to the patriots.\n\nWrangling the party to accept his choice would prove a lot easier than he expected. The men of Washington were so desperate for stability in such strange and shocking times, that his choice was quickly approved and confirmed by all relevant committees. With Vice President Taylor now at his side, ready to do whatever needed to be done to set America back on track, Thurmond gazed with confidence towards the rest of the struggle to come."

 strom.3.t:0 "The Devil From Down in Georgia"
 strom.3.desc:0 "Richard Russell Jr was a long time ally of President Thurmond, presidential candidate for the old State Rights Party back in '48, passionate opponent of many of President Kennedy's reforms, and now a key player in Thurmond's ambitions. In a phone call lasting hours, the two would discuss their stratagem for wrangling the government into accepting what they had planned. By the end, much had been laid out, but so much more remained to be done.\n\nThe government's hurried acceptance of his Vice President pick had made Thurmond realize the window of opportunity he had, and Russell advised him to take full advantage of it. While the NPP were still reeling from the assassination and the country remained numb, they were far more likely to accept his ambitions in the interests of regaining some legitimacy and normalcy. They would need to act fast, but the rewards for success would be great.\n\nThurmond tasked Russell with the job of gathering their allied lawmakers together to get the necessary bills drafted, and quickly. When all was written up, they would take the floor and pass each and every one of them, one after the other in a lightning round of politics. The party could be corralled to vote for them, and the Republican-Democrats were split enough that a few bipartisan votes could also be earned from more conservative seats."
 strom.3.a:0 "The strategy is set, and soon it will be time to play"

 strom.4.t:0 "Binding the Party"
 strom.4.desc:0 ""In this dangerous time for America, there can be no more room for discord and selfish bickering within our ranks. Our party must walk together in lockstep. I promise that under my leadership, this party will be more unified than it ever was before, and I am willing to use all necessary measures to ensure that our values - American values - are defended and enshrined forever!"\n\nIn a rousing speech delivered to the assembled NPP caucus, President Thurmond vowed to fight for the party against all struggles, both without and within. Denouncing the historically fractured nature of the NPP, he has declared that under his command, the party would move forward with one clear, decisive and "American" agenda. His remarks were met with enthusiastic acclaim by his fellow Right associates.\n\nFrom the sidelines, the Center looked on with steadily growing dread. They knew not how far President Thurmond might be willing to go to to unite the party under one agenda - his agenda. Through their muted but polite applause, they looked to one another and wondered how long their dreams of a fairer America could endure under their new leader."
 strom.4.a:0 "The NPP answers only to the President"

 strom.5.t:0 "Choosing the Bishop"
 strom.5.desc:0 "The time had finally come for President Thurmond to choose his cabinet. Naturally, this would no longer be a cabinet of idealists and supporters of government overreach like under President Kennedy, but a group committed to restoring dignity to the people of America.\n\nFirst on the agenda would be choosing his Secretary of State. Two candidates had distinguished themselves for the position. The first of these was the Senator for Arkansas, J. William Fulbright. Fulbright was an interesting individual; while he was a committed segregationist, he held a wide range of stances on various issues from across the political spectrum, and had seen eye-to-eye with the Republican-Democrats and the Center on many occasions. While perhaps not the most effective of choices, his potential for compromise could help soothe the other factions within the Senate and provide legitimacy for Thurmond's new government.\n\nThe second choice was Spiro Agnew. A capable and dedicated political operative, Agnew was more mild in his opinions on the segregation issue than Fulbright, but he could prove a valuable asset on account of his commitment and dedication to the American government. He was what some would call "loyal" and others would call "a yesman," but regardless of perspective it was assured that he would follow President Thurmond's decree to the letter.\n\nBoth men would be beneficial to Thurmond in different ways, but only one could fill the role of Secretary of State. By the day's end, Thurmond had made his decision."
 strom.5.a:0 "Spirow Agnew is our only hope"
 strom.5.b:0 "Fulbright is the way to go"

 strom.6.t:0 "Choosing the Knight"
 strom.6.desc:0 "Next on the agenda was to select the Secretary of Defense. Once more, two candidates had been shortlisted for the position, with the final decision left up to the President's decree.\n\nRobert Byrd, of West Virginian pedigree, is a proponent of strengthening and streamlining national security by providing extra funding to the Pentagon and the security services, while simultaneously "trimming the fat" and stripping out antiquated and unnecessary programs. Given the tensions that would undoubtedly arise from the more troublesome areas of society as a result of Thurmond's plans, a greater focus on security would not be remiss.\n\nAlternatively, there was Mendel Rivers. A representative of South Carolina since the War, Rivers is the epitome of an NPP Hawk. His fervent support of American military escalation in South Africa and his repeated calls for direct action against Japan had earned him the nickname "The Granddaddy of the War Hawks," a name he wore with great pride. His gung ho, guns blazing approach to foreign defence policy would be certain to appeal to the NPP as a whole."
 strom.6.a:0 "Byrd will ensure security and continued stability."
 strom.6.b:0 "Rivers will get the Hawks on our side."

 strom.7.t:0 "Choosing the Castle"
 strom.7.desc:0 "The final position needed to fill Thurmond's new cabinet was the Secretary of the Treasury. In the interests of providing a veneer of balance and legitimacy, the two candidates for the position were both individuals divorced from the segregationist debate altogether, each with policies that could greatly appeal to the masses and calm the turmoil in the wake of Kennedy's death and Thurmond's ascension.\n\nWilbur Mills, one of the most powerfull men in Congress as chair of the Ways and Means commitee is dedicated to the fight for Southern Rights and supports our position on taxes and the like, but tends to have a few social liberal leanings that could come to haunt us as we move forward with cementing power.\n\nOn the other hand, Russel B. Long is a man of strong political pedigree. The son of the so-called "Kingfish" Huey Long, and himself an accomplished Senator of Louisiana for many years, Long was a big proponent of government spending to improve the plight of the working poor, the elderly and the disabled. While not going so far as his father's more radical policies, Long fiercely believed that the plight of the less fortunate was the government's responsibility. While perhaps not the most economically viable option long term, he would only be necessary until the completion of Thurmond's crusade, and he would provide a much needed buffer of support from those he represented. With this final selection, the cabinet would be complete. A cabinet dominated by those loyal (or at least useful) to Thurmond's cause. Finally, the work could begin."
 strom.7.a:0 "Mills will reassure the working folk."
 strom.7.b:0 "Long will appeal to the masses."

 strom.8.t:0 "The Skewer from the Left"
 strom.8.desc:0 "It was to be expected, but it was no less frustrating. The day that President Thurmond confirmed his new cabinet was the day that many supporters of President Kennedy's reforms responded with abject disgust. Small protests broke out in more progressive minded towns, nowhere near as explosive as those during the height of civil rights violence but present nonetheless. Decrying Thurmond's "hijacking" of the NPP with "race haters" and "sycophants," the many angry voices of those aligned against him would cycle through the news cycle, spreading slowly and insidiously.\nMany of the protestors looked to the remaining progressives within the NPP for reassurance, hoping that they might frustrate the president's plans. More worryingly, some began to speak up in support of some of the most extreme factions within the Left wing of the party, believing that only their radical proposals could "expunge" segregationist thought from the nation for good. It would seem that Thurmond's scheming had not just united his opponents against him, but also disillusioned them with the rest of mainstream politics.\nSomething would need to be done to take back control of the narrative, or else the dissent would only continue to grow."
 strom.8.a:0 "Damned progressives!"

 strom.9.t:0 "Thurmond Addresses the Nation"
 strom.9.desc:0 " "My fellow Americans, we stand today on a precipice. The assassination of our president and vice president so soon after the felling of another has quite reasonably rocked our nation to its core, and I assure you that I understand your uncertainty and fear in this difficult time. But now is not the time for petty bickering or ideological opportunism. Now is the time that all of us need to come together, as Americans, to restore our country to greatness. A greatness born of tried and true American tradition, justice and dignity that may have wavered over the years, but now can be reborn anew. So let us put aside our scuffles, and work united to move past this awful tragedy together."\n\nToday, President Thurmond addressed the nation to appeal for calm in the midst of continued anxiety over the assassination and consternation over his radical shift of the government. Though his speech failed to calm down his more vocal opponents, many polls suggest that his speech was met with approval by much of the general public. Some have come to see the president as a paternal figure attempting to steer America out of an impossible position, and that his more questionable actions are simply necessary measures to stabilize the country in a time when stability is needed the most."
 strom.9.a:0 "We have America on our side."

 strom.10.t:0 "Goodnight, Sweet Prince?"
 strom.10.desc:0 "It seemed like so little time had passed since America had found itself mourning its last president, yet now another one lay dead before his time. While President Thurmond and Bobby Kennedy had not seen eye-to-eye on most things and stood as ideological opponents, Thurmond still held some respect for him as the first president to represent the National Progressive Party, who allowed Thurmond and his allies a place in the government even in spite of their differences.\n\nThere are calls both from within the government and without to honor the fallen president's life and the change he brought and continued to strive for. Several proposals have been drawn up, but the committees are awaiting the word of the President to bring forth their ideas. The necessary commemorations and constructions would be costly, but it would assuredly help soothe the nation and grant President Kennedy a dignified rest.\n\nCertain members of Thurmond's coalition have suggested instead a refrain from honoring him altogether, as this might be seen as an endorsement of his... disagreeable policies. It would certainly save time and money and keep opponents of Kennedy on board, but it would be guaranteed to be seen as a grave act of disrespect that may inflame the already bitter tensions emerged in the wake of Thurmond's ascension.\n\nThe decision lies with the President."
 strom.10.b:0 "He was our president. Let us honor him"
 strom.10.a:0 "Let him lie in the dirt. His legacy dies with him"

 strom.11.t:0 "The Final Insult"
 strom.11.desc:0 "The streets were even hotter today. The protestors who were already angry at President Thurmond for his shift of the NPP's policies now seethed with untold fury, and were joined by even more enraged voices. The president's decision to refrain from any honors for President Kennedy was seen as the final disgrace in a long line of petty and vindictive acts, and even many of Thurmond's supporters would call the dishonor crass.\n\nAll across America, protesters marched with renewed vigor, unfurling banners and leading chants praising the life and legacy of both of the Kennedys and decrying Thurmond's "betrayal" of Bobby's NPP, twisting it from a beacon of progress into a dark engine of reaction and bitterness. With many of the old civil rights forces and party activists out on the streets in fear of what more Thurmond would do, America had seemingly begun to pick at the scabs of what was once a settled conflict.\n\nIn the areas of the deprived and the intellectuals and the radicals, some would call the discarding of Kennedy's legacy the final proof of America's "hypocrisy". Ultimate evidence that there would never be true change as long as reactionary forces cling to the American government and drag the nation backwards. In their eyes, the only way to truly bring about an America for all would be to push for an entirely new form of politics.\n\nIn the halls of the Senate, the most radical of President Kennedy's allies would meet to discuss the swing in public opinion. Perhaps the party was not yet lost to them. Perhaps it would simply need a new, fresher, fiercer face."
 strom.11.a:0 "...perhaps some due to the dead was in order"

 strom.12.t:0 "Preparing a Send Off"
 strom.12.desc:0 "With the go ahead given to prepare for President Kennedy's memorial, the proposals have been lain out before all relevant parties. Two primary concepts have been accepted as the likeliest candidates, and await presidential approval before being given the green light.\n\nThe first proposal is for a memorial monument to be built in his name. The exact specifics of the memorial are yet to be determined - it could be a library, a statue like Lincoln's, perhaps some modern art - but the costings have been set out by party financiers. While expensive, it would hardly break the bank, and would be a more than suitable farewell to Bobby and his legacy.\n\nA proposal from some of the more starry-eyed members of Kennedy's old clique has come forward suggesting that a day be set aside as a national holiday in commemoration of his life and death. Though Thurmond's own circle have scoffed at such a seemingly excessive and most certainly more expensive measure, a grand gesture of remembrance could be exactly what is needed to unite a country still reeling from Kennedy's death.\n\nAlternatively, the whole endeavor could just be forgotten about. Though as before, the people may not appreciate that in the least."
 strom.12.a:0 "A monument would be more than enough"
 strom.12.b:0 "A new holiday couldn't hurt."
 strom.12.c:0 "This is a waste, scrap both proposals and forget it!"

 strom.13.t:0 "In Memoriam, Once More"
 strom.13.desc:0 "In their droves, Americans from all over came to the Capital to pay their respects. Tens of thousands gathered after sundown at the National Mall for a candlelit vigil in memory of President Kennedy. Amongst them were major figures of the Center NPP and some from the other factions, the families of Kennedy and of Vice President Humphrey, as well as many military figures, foreign dignitaries and so many others who were simply ordinary people come to grieve and offer condolences. Also amongst them, putting aside his plans and ambitions for one night, was President Thurmond.\n\nWalking amongst the people, talking to a few, Thurmond expressed his deepest sadness for the loss of Kennedy in spite of the many differences of opinion held between them, and spoke at length of the respect he had for the man in spite of everything.\n\nThe conclusion of weeks of mourning and numbness for the people of America would see the dawn of a new day. As the mourners returned to their homes, many had in spite of themselves developed a newfound respect for President Thurmond, who was so willing to offer genuine dignity to a fallen political rival."
 strom.13.a:0 "A heartfelt event, which should ease some tensions"

 strom.14.t:0 "The Ghost of Jim Crow"
 strom.14.desc:0 "It came so fast that some didn't even know it was happening until it was over.\n\nThe House and the Senate were gathered en masse. Legislation was introduced, with one simple goal. "The repeal of the Civil Rights Act, a law so counterethical to American values and tradition that it is a wonder it was ever considered," in the words of Richard Russel. Before the press had time to respond, the papers had already cleared the House. A few days trapped in committees allowed the rumor mill to build. Surely it wouldn't go through? Surely the remnants of the Center and the other progressive factions would kill it before it got to Thurmond's desk?\nWhen it passed by the slimmest of margins in the Senate through the heavy-handed wrangling of Thurmond's coalition of segregationist old guard, there was a brief hour of utter silence. And then the wounds of the civil rights era tore open anew, and the cascade of blood and hate and violence flooded the streets yet again.\nIn the South, jubilant segregationists ran black residents out of their homes, jeering and beating them wherever they could be caught. Across the Black Belt, cars burned and shop windows shattered as a people finally considered human now found themselves cast in the role of lessers once more. In the northern cities the activists screamed until they were hoarse, led by those who had marched once before to demand that the American dream be granted to all only to watch the fantasy be shattered before their eyes.\nIn New York City, before a huge crowd of supporters, the leader of the radical Left-NPP Gus Hall denounced with utter bitterness the takeover of the NPP in the name of bigotry and intolerance. Castigating the President in a half hour long rant, Hall demanded the immediate resignation of Thurmond and called for a new election "in which the people will certainly demonstrate their contempt for his despicable ploy to steal their future from them!" Before him, the crowd roared with approval. Center, Left, and Liberal voices joined together in one furious chorus. The government was against them all, they knew, and a united front of those willing to struggle for their rights would be needed to fight the good fight.\n\nOn that day in New York City, it would be said, the Center NPP truly died. In its place was the forces of the Left, united at last. And angry."
 strom.14.a:0 "We repealed the damned act, but at what cost?"

 strom.15.t:0 "Jim Crow's Eulogy"
 strom.15.desc:0 "As the day of the National Progressive Party's first party caucus since the death of President Kennedy approached, many wondered - some nervously, some gleefully - what the agenda of the day would be. Most were almost certain Thurmond would speak with regards to the Civil Rights Act. A call to end its enforcement at least, if not an outright revoke, was the almost assured point of call expected from the President. And when he took the podium to speak to the assembled politicians, he did indeed open with a talk on the fated matter.\n\nYet nobody present expected what he was about to say.\n\nAdmitting that he had long desired to revoke the Act, calling it "a sledgehammer trying to fix a splinter," Thurmond conceded to the concerned forces of the Center and the bewildered Far-Right that he could not allow himself to touch President Kennedy's most prestigious achievement. In the interests of party unity, in memory of President Kennedy and in the name of bringing stability back to America, Thurmond vowed that he would leave the Act in place. His speech concluded to the relieved applause of the Center-NPP and the stunned silence of many on the Right.\n\nAfter a long day of discussions on party conduct and other rather constructive matters, in which Thurmond won many of the Far-Right back with various promises to push forward some of their other agendas, the party emerged from their meeting more united than they had been in a long time. Though the Right and Thurmond himself quietly commiserated over the finality of civil rights, they accepted that a party and nation brought together was far more important than unrepentant reaction."

And true to their predictions, he did speak on it, and President Thurmond laid out how he was going to kill the Act. It would not be a quick, clean death, but a messy one.\n\nHis immediate mandate was not to revoke the Civil Right Act, but instead, he would be ordering the federal government to cease its enforcement. Any outstanding claims or protections made in its name would be dropped immediately, and the courts would no longer be allowed to invoke it in any rulings. In all but name only, the Civil Rights Act is no more.\n\nIn New York City, before a huge crowd of supporters, the leader of the radical Left-NPP Gus Hall denounced with utter bitterness the takeover of the NPP in the name of bigotry and intolerance.

 strom.17.desc:0 "The analysts had carefully pored over the census data. Analysed the voting records. Thoroughly considered the historical trends and socioeconomic factors contributing to local politics. When all was said and done, they got to drafting. Every inked line, every boundary, every population point was all part of an intricately calculated procedure. When the models had been brought to a reasonable degree of perfection, they were presented to the state legislatures, who signed the new district boundaries into law with nary another word.\n\nOnly by the next morning did anyone realize the deviousness of what had transpired. The independent analysts recognized the data, the population spread, the voting intentions, and balked at the new voting districts across the South and various other states under the NPP's domain. Each one had been painstakingly constructed to minimize the R-D voting share and maximize that of the NPP. Short of an unparalleled seismic shift in American politics, the affected states would be guaranteed NPP fiefdoms for the next decade or two at least.\n\nThroughout the affected states, the newly disenfranchised voters marched en masse. Many of the marchers were black, but now they were also joined by a contingent of white Democrat voters who shared their disgust at the blatant manipulation. The marches were bitter and marred with clashes against those who considered the new order most beneficial, but many of them were able to make their voices heard. Many were locals, some were just passing through. Some were from the fringes of the old Center, now emerging into the mainstream to seize the momentum against the damnable elite.\n\nIn Washington, President Thurmond and his chief advisors raised a glass and a cheer to the continued stability of the National Progressive Party."

All the headlines were about him these days, and they came up with so many colorful names. "Usurper President", "The Snake in Kennedy's Boot", even "America's Hitler." And though he scoffed at how unimaginative that last one was, he could not help but wonder.\n\nRedrawing district boundaries, stuffing the courts, blackmail, openly trodding upon the legacy of the man whose death made it all possible. What would history think of him? What would they think of these, admittedly, blatantly un-American actions he had taken since day one to get to where he was now. He already caught a glimpse of it, as he glanced out of the window at the masses of protestors beyond the White House fences. The thought did momentarily disquiet him...\n\nAnd it soon passed. His heart hardened. His anger flared at those lowlifes outside, protesting against the authority of states and the values that America had been founded upon. What did they know? Idealistic simpletons such as themselves were half the reason he had to do any of this in the first place, to undo years of government overreach in the name of blind progress. What he was doing was un-American, yes, but he was doing it specifically to save America!\n\nNo. Everything he was doing was good. Everything he was doing was righteous. And he would keep doing it until he saw his plans through to the end."

 strom.19.desc:0 "The stakes, thought President Thurmond, were too high to leave anything to risk as far as the law was concerned. In these difficult times, he needed judges who would... see things from his point of view. Officially, this was within his power to make sure of, but the precedent, well, that was a dangerous matter.\n\nGetting enough judges on the Supreme Court bench would require one of two possibilities. Either enough seats were given up, or he would make new seats and fill them. Freeing up seats would naturally require that those currently occupying those seats vacate them, and making sure they would be willing to retire so early would require some very underhanded tactics indeed. On the other hand, packing the court was an equally unscrupulous and far more overt measure that was certain to kick the American hornets' nest even harder.\n\nYet at this point, it hardly mattered. He had already come this far, and the restoration of American values was so close at hand. All it would take was shuffling a few chairs around, either way."

"In the interests of national security, we propose measures for the addition of four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States of America..."\n\nAlmost immediately the Senate floor descended into chaos. The Republicans in particular were furious, calling it an unforgivable and blatant act of tyranny, and the floor was not silent for several hours as insults and accusations were traded between the parties and even within them. On the other hand, the Democrats were notably ambivalent on the matter, and their apparent lack of scruples with the bill did not escape President Thurmond's eye. With the NPP in lockstep behind his bullrush to the finish, the Democrats' support could be key.\n\nEven with some heavy handed tactics, support for the bill in the Senate is low enough that without the support of the Democrats, it is very unlikely to pass. Getting them on board would be crucial to passing the bill... at least, through the usual means. As per the constitution, the President has the power to force the bill through as an executive order. However, given the current situation of American politics and its frequent description as a "powder keg," using such forceful measures at this time could have dire consequences."

 strom.21.desc:0 "A few backroom meetings later, and some degree of understanding has been reached between Thurmond's clique and the Democrats. While not entirely convinced of the bill and somewhat nervous about the implications, various Democrats expressed a willingness to get in bed with Thurmond in exchange for a few riders being added to the bill. They expressed tepid support for our push for conservative values, though they desired a means of cushioning the blow to their reputation from supporting dubiously moral actions. Namely, they desire the inclusion of support for their home states in the form of increased benefits for the unemployed and more state pensions.\n\nFor such a reasonable price, though perhaps a touch out of place on a security bill, the Democrats support can be all but secured. Of course, it's not certain if it will be enough. The Republicans are all but certain to vote unanimously against the bill, and though the party has corralled the remainder of the Center into supporting Thurmond, there is a possibility that someone might do something drastic.\n\n...of course, there is still the option of signing an executive order and doing away with the uncertainty. Come what may."

 strom.22.desc:0 "Historically, the role of Supreme Court justice had been filled by people of many different political affiliations. The diversity of the Supreme Court had kept one party from gaining overwhelming influence over the last two centuries; our judicial system was above all else. However, our great system has been growing rather degenerate under the previous Presidents. The preceding justices ruled against us far too many times, they showed an outright prejudice against the American way of life. Anyone with a sane mind could tell that our Supreme Court was turning sour, even impure. If our current justices had the option, they would sell our country immediately to the socialists and Fascists, and we just can't have these people holding office. This will change beginning today with our President Thurmond's most recent executive order.\n\nThe order passes four seats in the Supreme Court to Conservative Southern lawyers. The old justices were often indecisive and thus ineffective. Our new Supreme Court will be unified and its rulings shall be such. This will be part of a great reformation taking place in the great United States. Our people may not like the new judicial system at first, but they'll get used to it eventually; we need to instill Conservative values into every heart, every mind until we are unified as a nation. America has a new Conservative judicial system, and it shall live on until the end of time."

Some of the cases were somewhat on the weaker side, but it would be easy to fill them with false accusations. With enough true scandals to build off of, the false ones could easily be legitimized.\n\nNow all that was left to do was to arrange meetings with the judges in question.

Two of the judges immediately caved in, insisted they would "consider" the suggestions of the President and plan an early retirement. The other two, on the other hand, may prove to be a problem. A major problem.\n\nWhile they expressed a similar desire to consider their options, chatter was picked up by agents after the meeting that while they intend to retreat from public life, they are mortified by what they see as the "blatant corruption and blackmail" of the Thurmond government. While they have made no rash plans just yet, there exists a very real possibility that they may swallow their pride and talk to the press about what lengths the President is willing to go to to get his way.\n\nThis predicament has the potential to spiral out of control very quickly."

Already, President Thurmond had moved to replace the judges with four of his own candidates, already lined up and waiting to take their seats. The Supreme Court, in one fell swoop, had been transformed into a bastion of conservative law, and thanks to the comparably young age of the selected judges, it was likely to remain that way for a considerably long time.\n\nThe increasingly meek remnants of the Center cried foul, insisting some foul play was at hand. The Left didn't even try to hold back, with one Congressman having to be dragged from the hall outright accusing the President of treason. Their protestations fell on deaf ears, however. Indeed, across the South and Southwest many of the Far-Right's loyal supporters openly celebrated the move, hailing a triumphant return to "the good old days.""

Attempts to discredit the judges by releasing the compromising data backfired completely, merely proving their stories to be true.\n\nIn New York, the police were forced to fall back as riots against the government grew to unprecedented levels, and elsewhere many other demonstrations continued to spiral out of control. Only in the South was there any significant marches in support for the government. In Washington, amidst scenes of abject chaos not seen within the Senate since the Civil War, an embattled President Thurmond did the only thing he could do.\n\nBy the day's end, as half of America watched in fury and another half watched in glee, four new justices would sit on the Supreme Court, ready to adhere to the President's command."

Even Northern politicians have shown compliance with the rest of the country in implementing gerrymandering to give Conservatives offices in their states. Everything is going according to plan in our efforts to guarantee an America free of foreign influence.\n\nLiberal riots have been breaking out across the Northern cities today, with large-scale movements in New York City, Boston, and Chicago. Our finest police officers were quick to crack down on the protests and restore peace. Other democracies across the world condemn our actions and some even threaten to leave the OFN, but our diplomats are managing the situation as we speak.

I have not been the President you expected. I may not have been the one you wanted. But I am proud to call myself the President America needed. Who did what was necessary to prevent radical elements from steering our nation on the path to certain social decay!"\n\nHe paused as the applause from his fellow men of the Right drowned out all else. He briefly turned to the side, watching as every remaining Center representative stood in unison and moved silently for the exit, pointedly avoiding his gaze. To join the radicals outside, no doubt.\n\n"We have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that political stability in this nation is maintained, that our nation is never again led astray by short-sighted idealism and ignorance. Our eternal majority over the South shall be the bulwark ensuring that the mistakes of the Kennedy Presidency are never repeated. Hear me now - segregation is an American tradition, and those who would seek to trample on our flag with the mixing of the races and false equality shall never again rise to challenge it!"\n\nThurmond's heart beat furiously as the Right rose to salute and cheer him. But even now, at the cusp of his final victory, he felt a pang of unease. The chanting of the massive crowd outside yet echoed across Washington. It thundered across New York, Boston and Charleston. It roared across Nashville, Birmingham, Jackson and Atlanta. In Los Angeles and Baltimore and countless cities from sea to shining sea, America was on fire.\n\nPresident Strom Thurmond had achieved everything he had set out to do.

Shit, when Wallace had approached him to ask him to be his running mate he'd never thought the old bastard would actually get elected, and never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined himself taking the oath in Wallace's place. \n\nWallace had left the party in a unenviably weak position, with the factions threatening to rip the NPP in two as the RDs nipped at their heels and chaos enveloped the nation as a result of Wallace's less advisable decisions. The Republican-Democrats were a bunch of weak-ass limp-wristed pansies that couldn't be trusted to protect America from the depredations of her enemies, and the firebrands in the NPP would rather set the country on fire than work together. LeMay knew it was up to him to bring America down from a boil to a simmer and ensure the NPP was able to stand united at the next election. The RDs could not be allowed to take control, and neither could the factionalists be permitted to tear the party apart. \n\nTrue to form, President LeMay struck a match and lit himself a fine Cuban cigar to puff on as he hollered for one of his aides to make him a gin and tonic. He leaned back in his chair and blew smoke rings at the ceiling. He'd never asked to be President, or even really wanted it, but being the leader of the free world was sure to have its perks.

If people want something in this country they can damn well work for it, I ain't in the habit of giving handouts, and it'll be a cold damn day in hell before I compromise with the Krauts or the fuckin' Nips." \n\nHarrington composed himself and, with the utmost care, began again. "Mr. President, I understand wanting to be tou-" \n\nAnd that was as far as he got before LeMay took the cigar out of his mouth, leaned his paunch over the desk, and belted back, "Goddamn right I want to be tough on the ingrates and the malcontents and the fuckin' fascists! I got nothin' more to say on the topic." \n\nHis face twisted in disgust, Harrington rose from his chair. "I'm not going to sit here and take this disrespect.

He coldly turned and strode for the door. \n\nPresident LeMay took another drag on his cigar and wheezed with laughter as Harrington made his way out. "Tell your buddies not to get too comfy, Mike!

To the aides cowering along the walls, it was like watching a particularly furious tennis match between where the players were both affecting a cool aura while also whacking the ball with every ounce of fury their bodies could summon. \n\nFinally, they got to the crux of the issue. "I'm running this show, Barry," growled the President, "Not you. Me. You might be a bigshot next to them swishes in the Rep-Dems but your mincing don't impress me none. I got no intention of kowtowing to you just to get a few more votes and that's the long and short of it. If you stand in my way you'll find out damn quick why they call me Bomber LeMay." \n\nGoldwater jerked the corner of his mouth up in a joyless imitation of a smile and finished his drink. "That's what they call you, is it? Well," he said, betraying no emotion, "I guess we're done here." \n\nAfter Goldwater had left, LeMay sat quietly for a time. Goldwater was patently a dangerous man, maybe the only one with any teeth in the whole of the goddamn RDs. Without a doubt, he was one to watch, lest he wake up one morning to find a knife in his back."

lemay.4.t:0 "Like Wallace Never Left"
lemay.4.desc:0 ""You'll do no such thing!" screamed President LeMay down the telephone, spittle coating the mouthpiece, as he brutally castigated the House Majority Whip. "Don't even fuckin' think about it, you damn pansy! You'll whip those bastards in line or I'll have your head on a goddamn pike on the White House lawn by sundown! Don't think I'm gonna take this shit just 'cus I ain't been sitting on my ass in Congress collecting moss for the last twenty years! Do your goddamn job or it's your ass!" \n\nHe slammed the receiver down so hard that for a moment he thought he'd broken it. LeMay exhaled and leaned backwards in his chair. Why'd they all have to be so goddamn difficult? His men in Congress, who by all rights should be following his commands, preferred to forget that he was now the President, even if all the chairs in the White House were still warm from Wallace's ass. A fair few of the bastards thought that a change of President meant they could do whatever the hell took their fancy, an idea he was having to forcibly dissuade them of, one by one. \n\nThe people of America had elected Wallace and LeMay because they wanted certain policies to be enacted, and it would be patently undemocratic to do anything other than to continue following the policies Wallace began before his unfortunate exit from the sphere of politics. Christ, most of these men wouldn't even be in Congress if it weren't for Wallace, and now bastards like this twinkle-toes Whip were vacillating about instituting tougher immigration quotas. \n\nFuck 'em, thought the President. If they think they can run roughshod over me they've got another thing coming."

lemay.5.t:0 "Beginning Integration Quotas?"
lemay.5.desc:0 "Mr. President, I know you are a busy man with the whole running a country thing, but there is something I have to bring to your attention: integrating schools in the South. I know, I know, it's a can of worms, and no matter what you do, there will be a bunch of people who aren't happy. Either pro-civil rights guys will call you a segregationist toady if you don't immediately make everyone equal, and the states rights folks will call you a fascist for stepping on the toes of their constitutional prerogative.\n\n However, the folks at the Department of Education and the Department of Justice have come up with a way to get around it: Integration quotas. By "encouraging" states to make a percentage of class rosters have a minimum number of another race, we will be taking the first steps to integrating the schools. It doesn't have to be high, like five or ten percent, but enough to start the process rolling.\n\n Yes, there will be ways school will try to get around this. They can try to make a whole class of just blacks that are kept in a closet or something. But we will have some inspections and regulations to ensure that each class from kindergarten to Grade 12 have at least one black student. Schools that disobey the rules will be fined and could lead to further inspections.\n\n Yes, I know. They will get their way around it. But, if we start with a small number of students, then over time we can increase it, resistance will break down, and eventually Southern schools will be fully integrated. The only decision we have to make now, Mr. President, is how big of an initial quota do you want to put in place?"
lemay.5.a:0 "Keep it low: this is just a token measure."
lemay.5.b:0 "Bump it higher: The sooner they integrate, the sooner it will be over."

lemay.6.t:0 "Integration Quotas Established"
lemay.6.desc:0 ""United States President Curtis LeMay announced this morning integration quotas that all public schools in the Southern portion of the country must abide by."\n\n"LeMay has demanded that all public schools in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina must adhere to new integration laws that will be implemented in the next school year. These schools must consist of at least 5% Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or any other racial minority population living in the state. Failure to comply with the order will result in action taken by the federal government along with the state government."\n\nThese words reached newspapers across the country, but they resonated most with the desegregationists reading. Immediately, leading desegregationists complained that President LeMay "set the bar way too low" and believed "the South would never fully integrate at this rate". Even other NPP politicians, mostly left-wing, denounced LeMay for his less-than-exceptional public school policy. Facing pressure on many different sides, the President must now decide the best path for proceeding with integration: keep Southern states content with the current integration policy, or favor the desegregationists by raising the percentage of minorities that will be admitted."
lemay.6.a:0 "Keep the current policy as-is."
lemay.6.b:0 "Raise the bar for Southern schools to meet."

lemay.7.t:0 "[GetYear] Integration Quota"
lemay.7.desc:0 "It's been another year, Mr. President, since we last discussed the implementation of integration quotas on Southern schools. It hasn't been easy, as we are trying to push some of the most stubborn people on this planet to do something they don't want, which in this case is treating African-Americans and Hispanics the same as white folks.\n\n The quotas that we established are fairly low, as we believed that by easing our way to desegregation, by showing the south that it won't be the end of the world. While some liberals are claiming we are moving too slowly, and many conservatives are outraged that we are interfering in states rights, I think we can be confident that we must be doing the moderate and right thing since everyone hates us.\n\n Inspections are still being undertaken, and show that, for the most part, integration is taking place. There are reports of white students bullying and assaulting their new black counterparts, as well as stories of teachers neglecting their new charges, but overall, it is going forward, and the majority of black students are seeing higher test scores and better results than when they were in all black schools. So I think we are on the right course, Mr. President."

lemay.8.t:0 "Quieting Them Down"
lemay.8.desc:0 "President LeMay hung up the phone and immediately took a belt of scotch. Christ, but Wallace had left a mess for him to clean up. Somehow, while he hadn't been looking, Wallace had managed to piss off everyone in Congress aside from his hardliner allies, and unfortunately for him they seemed to see him as nothing more than Wallace's toady and were already busy giving him hell. \n\nHell, it's not like he'd asked to be President! For a fleeting instant he fantasized about resigning like Nixon, but he squashed that notion like a bug. If he went down that path, a dark cloud would follow him around for the rest of his life. At least in the White House he had a chance to bring Wallace's worst excesses to a screeching halt and make sure those milquetoast pussies in the RDs didn't sway the nation to their side by the next election. Who knows, he thought, smiling disbelievingly, maybe he could even do something to make America a better place. \n\nGoddamn it all, he was having a hell of a job trying to convince the Republicans and the Center faction that he wasn't the second coming of Wallace. He'd managed to get his foot in the door, but they were pushing back just as hard, and he knew he had to get them on his side if he was going to exert any leadership at all over Congress. The President sighed. Time to lick some more Republican ass. He finished his drink, put the receiver to his ear, and began to dial."

lemay.9.t:0 "A Meeting With the Widow Smith"
lemay.9.desc:0 "President LeMay was used to subservient women who'd obey his every command, fulfill his every need. Fetch him drinks, clean his clothes, raise his daughter. As such, it was hard for him to accept the beating he was getting from the rising star of the NPP's Far Right faction, Margaret Chase Smith. \n\nA woman? Talking back not just to a man, but to the goddamn President of the United States? Unheard of. And yet, despite his initial misgivings at Smith's acid tongue and refusal to cower to his usual array of domination tactics, he found himself growing more fond of her with every passing minute. She may have been a broad, but damn it all, she had a heart of the coldest iron. Hell, she had more balls than all the limp-wristed Jap-loving queers in the Republican-Democrats put together! \n\nAnd so as he sat there puffing away at a fine Cuban cigar, gin and tonic in hand, he reflected that if she'd stood up to the excesses of McCarthy it was foolish to think she wouldn't stand up to him. Besides, he could use an ironclad like her on his side, and she'd be in a better place to seize the nomination with him in her corner. \n\nIn her grating Maine accent, Smith was laying out her plan to mend the rift within the NPP and heal the wounds of Wallace's worst extremes. "Mr. President, this is the time for moderation. If we don't unify the party, we'll get buried at the next election. After Wallace, the people need stability, and they're looking to the RDs. If we don't get them to swing back our way soon we can say goodbye to our brief time in the sun." And you can say goodbye to the White House, thought LeMay. \n\nShe gave him a look of stern appraisal, and he realized she was waiting for his response. The President leaned back in his chair, and, glass in hand, extended his index finger to point in her direction. "Mrs. Smith, I believe we can work together.""

lemay.10.t:0 "A Meeting With Scoop"
lemay.10.desc:0 "Henry "Scoop" Jackson: avowed liberal, infamous firebrand, new favored son of the NPP's Center faction. Having previously only briefly met him, President LeMay was expecting to find him as insufferable as all the other crusaders in the Center faction, but once they'd started talking they got along surprisingly well. Jackson accepted a cigar and before they got down to business the two chatted amiably about football and Jackson's service in the War. \n\nDespite himself, LeMay was finding that he rather liked ol' Scoop. Not only did they have an instant connection, they had similar goals in policy, despite coming from different sides of the party. Like him, Jackson also believed in American military interventionism as a tool for creating a better world, and with the importance of expanding and developing America's air power. Having been a general of the Air Force, LeMay heartily agreed with him. \n\nJackson exhaled a long stream of smoke. "Mr. President, I have to express in the harshest terms my opposition to detente with the fascist powers. The more room we give them, the more they'll demand. It'll never end. It's imperative that we expand America's influence, militarily if need be, across the world, including into Germany and Japan's spheres. Only by doing this can we ensure a peaceful and prosperous future." \n\nPresident LeMay took a drag on his cigar and, tilting his head back, exhaled a plume of smoke into the air above him. "You know, Scoop, I quite agree.""
lemay.10.a:0 "This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."

lemay.11.t:0 "The Civil Right's Act of [GetYear]"
lemay.11.desc:0 "As the President had expected, the furious phone calls began almost immediately. After the first few Congressmen yelling in his ear, LeMay had calmly left the phone off the hook and ordered that no visitors be admitted. Feeling completely and totally at peace, he sipped at a gin and tonic, for once without his customary cigar. \n\nLeMay wondered how many great reforms had been stopped in their tracks because it might have hurt at the ballot box. Most Presidents spent their years in the White House choked with the fear of losing re-election, but LeMay was not most Presidents. Having no desire to stand for the nomination, LeMay felt he was in the perfect place to push through some of the reforms America desperately needed after Wallace's abuses of power, chief among those the long-belated Civil Rights Act. \n\nOf course, he'd known there'd be blowback. Most of those who had voted for him on Wallace's ticket had done so to prevent the advancement of civil rights, and keep segregation going indefinitely. Now, however, the President was beyond caring. He could hardly call himself a liberal, but he'd come to see the way blacks were treated in America as being patently against the virtues of freedom and liberty the Founding Fathers had revolted to bring into being. Since he sat in the Oval Office for the time being, he'd decided to do something about it. \n\nLeMay had been expecting to spend his Vice-Presidency shoved into a corner as Wallace ran rampant over America. He'd never expected to do anything of consequence, much less to change history. The President finished his drink. He was sure there'd be recrimination from the people who were, until recently, his strongest supporters, but he couldn't find it in him to give a damn. Someone had to do it, sooner or later."

The country is on their 5th president in just a few years and the current one is not the man for the task at hand.\n\nStill, LeMay is the boss. The Executive Branch is his to command. The NPP in Congress are loyal...for now. He faces a serious lacuna in how to proceed. He could play the role of a politician, carrying out the NPP-FR platform as best he can while tit-for-tatting the C-NPP and the Dems for legislative support as needed. But LeMay never personally gave a damn about segregation. Maybe this is an opportunity for him to become the Maverick he was always meant to be, and use his sure-to-be one term in office to force integration through come hell or high water, going down as a hero among the decent folks in America."
USA_hardest_of_lines_desc:0 "LeMay may be an Ohioan Yankee, but he knows he needs the support of the Southern Wallace voter in order to stay in office and keep the NPP-FR strong. We obviously can't be openly racist maniacs who try to gut the CRA, defund black schools, and impose segregation on the North - look where that got Wallace. But we can take a firm stand for American private enterprise and slow down the inevitable integration as best we can.\n\nLeMay will reassure his Southern support base that he stands for their sovereignty and the integrity of their way of life. He will try to convince the North that he accepts limited integration as well, and try to salvage whatever support he can get from the C-NPP. LeMay may have to sacrifice his own personal values, but his duty demands he try to save the party."
USA_wrangle_the_NPP_desc:0 "How on Earth Wallace ever managed to convince all these pinko social democrats in the party to back him is entirely beyond the understanding of President LeMay. Nevertheless, duty demands he do his best to whip the C-NPP in line.\n\nLeMay will sit down for a chat with Michael Harrington, the democratic socialist commanding the C-NPP bloc. He will assure him that he also wants to implement desegregation in America, however much it may appear the contrary. This will hopefully be enough to save the party's unity."
USA_promise_what_they_want_desc:0 "Talk is cheap, so we can afford plenty of it. The C-NPP may be a persistent monkey on our back but maybe with enough integrationist buzzwords we can coax 'em off and move forward with our agenda.\n\nLeMay will turn on the charm in a series of conferences with the center bloc. He will assure him that of course he supports integration and racial equality, but that he has to carefully weigh ideals against pragmatism when it comes to reckoning with the Far Right bloc. Integration will be promised, however limited it may end up being. This should be sufficient to placate the C-NPP."
USA_allies_across_the_aisle_desc:0 "Wallace may have been charismatic enough to win an upset victory in '64, but his removal makes clear that political compromise was never his strong suit. But LeMay sees opportunities which Wallace was blind to, and he sees a rising conservative movement among the Democrats who are more...understanding of the Southern perspective than the Republicans.\n\nLeMay will reach out to the Democrats by meeting with Barry Goldwater, a rising star among their conservative wing. The President will show him that they agree on more issues than they disagree, and will express enthusiasm for working with the Democrats to build strong conservative institutions in America. Of course, Goldwater may have to be a little more flexible on the civil rights issue, but that's what compromise is all about, isn't it?"

The R-D's are a bunch of milquetoast pissants who don't have the guts to shake down Japan. The C-NPP can rest assured that despite our differences on civil rights, "Bombs Away" LeMay will make Tokyo tremble, and avenge the injustices of the Second World War."
USA_like_wallace_never_left_desc:0 "Say what you will about Wallace, but unlike LeMay the people actually voted for him. Wallaceism was made public policy by the will of the people, and LeMay has a duty to uphold it despite his personal misgivings. The South can rest assured that LeMay will do his best to protect their freedoms and traditional ways of life.\n\nLeMay will defend Wallace's legacy. Wallace was overall a good man, but was only brought down by a few critical mistakes that should not outshine his otherwise stellar performance. President LeMay is Wallace's former veep, and the South shall be proud of his enduring commitment to Wallace's grassroots revolution against federal tyranny."
USA_select_integration_desc:0 "LeMay has talked the talk and now it's time to walk the walk. Specifically, he's going to walk a very thin tightrope where he must convince the R's and C-NPP that he's given them what they wanted while showing the Southern D's and FR-NPP that he ain't laid a finger on their domestic institutions.\n\nThe President will begin drafting an incredibly limited integration programme. Schools will be "desegregated", but not forced to consolidate their formerly black and white school districts. Businesses will be "integrated" but the owners will be given the benefit of the doubt on all service refusals. And of course, everyone will be allowed to take their sweet time integrating.

Are we going to tell Harvard they have to take every pauper off the street? Obviously not, so who is the Federal government to tell White private schools they have to take in Black students who would distort their carefully cultivated learning environment?\n\nPresident LeMay will give the green light to "segregation academies" by exempting private schools from integration quotas. Any man of means will be free to enroll his children in private sector education. And if some of those schools choose to bar certain students on the grounds of their race, that's their prerogative. Not the government's schools, not the government's problem."

Not at all.\n\nWe will fill our integration legislation with a heaping helping of exemptions. Private schools were already exempt, but now public schools will find an exemption too if they try hard enough. No matter how nonsensical their reasons are, any school will be able to exercise their right to deny admission to students of color."

Now black and white, they may fight; but when the enemy comes we'll get together and run 'em out of sight.\n\nPresident LeMay will go on the air and try to calm our racial tensions. He will state that his new civil rights legislation is the definitive answer to the Civil Rights Struggle. He will also remind us of our shared struggle against Japanese imperialism and avenging our territorial losses in the war. Hopefully this will help us bind up our wounds and move on."
USA_protect_our_troops_desc:0 "The military is our nation's most beloved institution. They are the heroes who won us the first World War and did their damndest in the second.

As long as black children get a decent education now, we can take our time integrating them in the future. This will hopefully mollify the center and leave the Far-Right elated."

He did everything he should have done, everything he could be expected to do.\n\nSo why does the center still gripe? Why do they drone on about rights for this and rights for that?

Anyone who disagrees can find another party.\n\nLeMay will make support for integration a requirement for continued membership in the NPP-FR.

We will implore the Southerners to think of themselves as a classically tolerant people, kind and courteous to all mankind. Hopefully this will mitigate our popularity losses in the Southern states once LeMay implements his master plan..."
USA_perfectly_balanced_desc:0 "In Wallace's day, the "Progressive" part of our name wasn't worth a wooden nickel. The Far Right exercised hegemonic control over the party and left the Center bloc in the dust. But under LeMay, all will have a fair say. Having purged the segregationists from the Far Right and made deals with the liberal Republicans, the balance of power between the NPP's Far Right and Center wings has been made equal. Consequently, it's time to start making many things in this country more equal.\n\nWith the party now whipped into line, LeMay will begin his real political initiatives. This will include pro-business tax policies, educational investments, strengthening of the military, and of course, the Civil Rights Act. After cutting the segregationist deadweight loose, President LeMay is ready to start putting his plans into action."
USA_military_model_to_integration_desc:0 "Some businessmen who want to be politicians like to say they'll govern this country like they ran their companies. Well President LeMay plans to run this country like a company too, a company of soldiers that is.\n\nAs CiC, LeMay will give the order to desegregate and by God it shall be done. The Armed Forces will be desegregated as soon as his pen leaves the paper and this will be the model America shall follow."
USA_tax_breaks_for_business_desc:0 "Lester Maddox may be salty about having to serve black people at the Pickrick, but maybe he'll calm down once he learns he owes Uncle Sam less money because of it.\n\nPresident LeMay will offer businesses a carrot alongside his stick. He will slash business taxes in order to promote economic growth. This will hopefully boost his standing among the American business class and give him further support for his magnum opus civil rights legislation"
USA_expand_the_GI_bill_desc:0 "Ever since the passage of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, those who've served this country can rest assured that this country shall serve them too. But it's nowhere near enough. A large cause of the present American Depression is the fact that our veterans feel neglected and disrespected after our defeat in the war, it's time for that to change.\n\nPresident LeMay will draft expansions to G.I. Bill subsidies. Veterans can rest assured that if they go to any public university in their state, their tuition will be paid for in full and receive stronger pensions and unemployment benefits. This will ensure that our veterans can contribute to the economy and feel well-rewarded for their service."
USA_university_tax_breaks_desc:0 "Of course, when a large amount of students suddenly show up at the universities, their resources will be mighty strained by the influx. If we want our veterans to get a proper education, it's only fitting that we should help our universities accommodate them.\n\nPresident LeMay will announce special tax breaks for universities. This should loosen up room in their budgets to expand their programs and living accommodations. Hopefully our national education levels will approve as a result."
USA_pull_back_economic_intervention_desc:0 "Aside from forcing them to integrate, the government doesn't need to have such a heavy hand in the private sector. That's one tenet of Wallaceism LeMay can get behind. The federal government has no business playing nanny to every shopkeep in the country, it's time to let our businesses become free to flourish.\n\nLeMay will loosen business regulations and cut various programs that sought to direct the economy. This will save money in our budget and also allow businesses more freedom to contribute to the economy."
USA_militarized_schools_desc:0 "We need fresh meat for the grinder, and the freshest meat is ripe as soon as it leaves high school. To make sure these potential recruits don't go off to college or get a career, we need to send recruiters directly to schools to steer them on the right path.\n\nLeMay will fund a military recruitment drive in the nation's high schools. These will involve recruiters setting up tables and giving pep talks on why serving your country can be a great career path. This should boost recruitment numbers."
USA_the_american_nationalist_desc:0 ""Have pride, my fellow Americans. Have pride that the Han coal miner in Manchukuo, the Polish slave in Upper Silesia and the Frenchman deprived of his humanity in Burgundy all look towards one source of inspiration. One course of light that shines a ray of hope on all mankind, the last beacon of liberty and humanity's last chance for emancipation. We, the United States of America, are that light. As long as we keep it burning, it shall one day illuminate the whole world."\n\nLeMay will give a rousing patriotic speech to unite the nation in anticipation of his upcoming Civil Rights Act. Hopefully this will mitigate the impact the act will have on the stability of our nation."
USA_military_pipeline_desc:0 "The South has historically furnished this country with some of its finest officers while the North has provided materiel through its factories. We cannot afford to keep having such a lopsided system, especially when it's becoming clear that the quality of equipment is often just as important as the quality of generals.\n\nPresident LeMay will invest in a new military industry in the South. This should provide plenty of jobs for locals and mitigate some of the resentment that the white population will feel with the CRA passes."
USA_liberty_and_justice_for_all_desc:0 "When Curtis LeMay first took his seat in the Oval Office, he was not the man for the job. Yet over the past several months he has already upended American politics and remade the NPP in his image. All his hard work, all his sacrifices, it's all built up to this moment, his magnum opus as President:\n\nThe Civil Rights Act.\n\nWallace would blow a gasket when he finds out what it contains. This Civil Rights Act is far more progressive than anything John F. Kennedy could have developed. It's astoundingly strict on school segregation and just as brutal on transport segregation. This will hit the Senate floor and LeMay will do everything in his power to push it through. When he leaves office, he will be remembered as the only President in history to have thrown away his entire political future to stand up for the Other America.\n\n§xThis is a complete betrayal of everything the §gNPP Far-Right§! §xstood for in 1964.§! §rCertain forces§! §xin this country will seek revenge.§!"

For Southern states, this means that they can use an armed paramilitary force to march Freedom Riders to the backs of busses at gunpoint. However, most states have no interest in maintaining such a force and could scarcely afford them in the first place.

During his thoughts and contemplations, he heard the door creak open behind him, as one of his aides, some boy named Wilson, said aloud, "President Wallace, sir, Mr. Kennedy is here to see you, sir." "Thank you, Wilson, now, let us be." the President responded, as the boy walked out and Bobby Kennedy walked in. After a few moments of silence, Wallace turned, nodded his head at Kennedy, saying "Mr. Kennedy, please, sit down, you wanted to speak after all." As Robert Kennedy stepped forward with a smile, shook his hand, and sat down ahead from the President. \n\n"Well, Mr. President, I wanted to start our little meeting off with congratulating you, sir, as these past few years have finally managed to bring our party to victory. Actually, before we continue, would you like a drink to celebrate?" He said, pulling out a small flask. The President, offering a small smile, pulled out some glasses to enjoy, as Kennedy poured the drinks and the men toasted. "Well, President Wallace, I know that you are a man of business and work, so while I would love to continue the cheering, we ought to move on to the business." Wallace's smile faded slowly. "President Wallace, you are a man of patriotism and party, you have fought and bled your way all the way to the top, and now, you have the opportunity to do great things for the country. In this," he stopped to drink, "the children of America deserve just as great an opportunity as any of us. While the people of America deserve choice, the great freedom of choice, these are children we're talking about here, Mr. President. Segregation, although it's a choice, is not going to make these kids' lives any better, sir." \n\nWallace leaned back in his chair in contemplation of Kennedy's statement, twiddling his thumbs. After leaning forward, he looked at Robert in the eyes and said, "Mr. Kennedy, do you realize that I have built my entire foundation on the freedom of the American people? On guaranteeing their rights. Children's education or not, this has gotten me into the Presidential office, what has gotten the NPP to finally succeed after all these years of Republican-Democratic bullshit. Now, tell me, Mr. Kennedy, how would I be able to continue from here?" Kennedy felt the tension in the room skyrocket before saying, "By putting heart and mind over the number of votes, Mr. President.""

It just so happened that the same President Wallace swore off television, radio, telephones for the day, declaring that he had too much work to do and that they'd only distract him. He even said "not to dare walk into the Oval Office unless the Japanese are storming San Diego." It wasn't until the Secretaries and Aides of the office got so pent up with fear that they shoved one man under the bus to do the work: that timid kid, Wilson. They shoved him forward to enter the office. Greeted with a fuming "What?" from the President before Wilson picked up. "Um, sir, uh, the news, sir." \n\nThey were just lucky enough to catch a rerun of the official entire rant given to NBC that morning. "This is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, and now, Mr. Kennedy, you seemed quite eager to join us on the news, and we couldn't turn you down! Tell us, what's got you so pent up this morning, Robert?" the newscaster asked. "We'll, Mr. Reig, I'd like to explain a grievous insult to the American spirit and the National Progressive Party's goals as a whole. You see, I had a meeting with President Wallace yesterday about the status of segregation of the education system. Now, obviously, I represent the Progressive wing of the NPP, and thus I care to spread social justice towards Americans, especially the children of America. President Wallace, however, seems to spit in the image of that belief. He instructed me to, as the President himself said, 'get the hell out of his office, Bobby," at my request that he laxes certain positions for the betterment of our next generation." "You're saying that the President said that to you, Mr. Kennedy?" Reig asked. "Absolutely, sir. While I have met several lowly politicians in my lifetime, never in my life have I met an obstinate, ignorant, angry child in the form of a man that wishes to undo the education system for the color of people's skin. Someone who dared to-" \n\nThe Television set clicked off. Wallace's secretaries and aides stood ahead from him as he sat in his chair. "Get out." the President muttered under his breath. "What?" asked Wilbur Mills. "I said, get the fuck out of my office!" As the veins in the President's neck looked as if they were ready to burst. The staff walked slowly back to their offices."

Today, it was a pristine envelope with a higher quality than that of kings of foreign lands. On the front, the envelope was sealed with a large wax "K." Wallace tore it apart, revealing a large note adorned with the words "Call me." followed by the signature of Robert Kennedy. \n\nThe conversation seemed to last for hours. Wallace dialed the phone to hear an explosion of fury on the other end of the line, as a furious Bobby Kennedy awaited the President. "Kennedy, calm the hell down, what are you trying to say?" asked Wallace. "What am I trying to say? You no good, double-crossing liar, you swore you would not dare touch the northern united states with your segregating hands, and look at what you did! You tried to upend the social order and plant your damned racist crap everywhere! What happened to promises, are those not official down in Alabama?" Kennedy responded. "Oh." Wallace said slowly, nearly chuckling as he did so. "Well, you see, Bobby, promises mean all the world in Alabama. However, that's part of the game here in Washington. Maybe your big ole "Da" didn't tell you, but he lost in his presidency, became a loser, because he couldn't keep up with the game, unlike myself, who will not lose for this country as you will and your father did. Sorry for your inconvenience." "You no good son of a-" the line clicked as Wallace promptly hung up the phone. "The NPP isn't going to survive on good gestures like he has planned." \n\nThat evening, American television captured one of the greatest political spectacles in modern history. Robert "Bobby" Kennedy joined NBC Nightly News host Howard Reig to express his "dissatisfaction" with the Wallace presidency. His dissatisfactions ranged from George C. Wallace being a "racist" to a "liar" to "pig-headed" to "an angry child who seems to hate the children around him." LeMay, Burke, and Mills had joined him in the Oval Office during the live airing that night. Wallace turned off the television set, prompting the three men to turn towards the President to gauge his reaction. Wallace got up silently, walked to grab the chair that Kennedy sat on during their discussion, and slammed it repeatedly into the television set, destroying the glass and collapsing the framework."

Sometimes it felt like they'd been a powerful force for American society, and sometimes it felt like everyone in America had a bone to pick with the administration. Wallace was wading through these thoughts when he was suddenly interrupted by a phone call. "Hello?" Wallace asked. "Good morning, sir, Robert Kennedy's on the line, would you like me to patch it through to you?" his secretary asked. "Sure, sure, put Bobby on the phone." The phone clicked and Wallace heard a new voice pour through, "President Wallace, are you there, sir?" "Sure, Robert, what do you need?" Wallace responded. "Well, sir, I wanted to say that I genuinely appreciate the actions you've taken following our little discussion. It's nice to know that in the modern day, I have someone I can rely on, different or not. With that, be sure to tune into the NBC Nightly News tonight, I think you'll enjoy it." Wallace was appreciative in the end, saying that "A promise is a promise." Before they ended the conversation. \n\nThat night, as work was wrapping up for the President, he turned on the television set within the Oval Office. Turning it to the news channel, Wallace was greeted with a flashy logo before zooming into the host and Robert Kennedy himself. "Good evening folks, this is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, and I am joined by Robert F. Kennedy himself. How are you doing this evening, Mr. Kennedy?" Kennedy responded strongly, saying "I'm doing quite well tonight, it's a beautiful evening with beautiful happenings in Washington." "Really? And what may that be, Mr. Kennedy?" Reig asked. "Well, sir, the details are a rather private matter, but they do concern President Wallace, a firm member of the NPP, and as I've come to realize, a truthful and loyal man." "Now, as far as I know, Wallace and you have come to blows in the past over issues, correct?" Reig asked. "You may be correct, Mr. Reig. However, agree or disagree with anyone, it isn't about that. To recognize the virtues laid within a man, even if you may happen to harbor completely different world views. That is where the term "respect" comes into play, especially in the circles of Washington D.C." For the rest of the evening, Reig and Kennedy continued to go back and forth about different ideas and respect. But no matter what, Wallace knew his concessions may cost him. But in the end, he knew he did the right thing."

wallace.533.desc:0 "Every time President Wallace had to look at that map, he grew more and more disgusted with what he had to look at. Battles across the United States, not with rifles and bombs, but with words and bills. The North hadn't backed down faced with Wallace's desire to finally segregate the education system, and every day, more and more resources, time, and effort had to be dedicated to this process. It was exhausting to everyone, including the President. However, in the middle of a few advisors pinpointing possible speeches and campaigns to earn the President's approval, a phone call interrupted the action of the room. "Hello?" asked Wallace. "Copy this down, Mr. President, every word of it. I can't be on the phone for too long, but you're going to want to hear this." A raspy voice called back.The men in the room aside from Wallace stood silent as the scratches of pen meeting paper and the occasional "Uh huh." and "Are you sure?" came from the President. After a few minutes, the President issued a "Thank you." before clicking the phone. Everyone, out, LeMay you ought to stay but I want everyone out of this room and no one within thirty feet of that damned door for the rest of the night!" The men slowly exited the room. \n\n"LeMay, we may have just found our breakthrough into the North." Wallace said frantically. "Alright, sir, what's going on? Who was that?" LeMay responded. "Wouldn't say, but it's not who they are that matters, it's what they said." Wallace said, walking over to point at the map. "There, Pennsylvania. Strong voiced Senator, direct opposer of segregation in the North, and absolute opponent of it for anywhere in the United States. However, that strong voice of his may die down a bit when he may hear we know about the kid he has outside of his marriage that he hangs around and makes payments for." Wallace said. "A bastard? No offense, sir, but is that going to be enough to really push him to work with us?" LeMay responded. "Definitely, when we inform the public of the slant-eyed bastard. Kid's Japanese, Curtis, a fucking Jap!" Wallace said. LeMay stroked his chin in contemplation. "God above, that's a lot to use against the man. Are you sure you want to unleash hell on him like that, sir?""

wallace.534.desc:0 "It had been a little while since President Wallace pushed that threat into the big, strong Senator from Pennsylvania. Days since, with proceedings going on regarding possible groundbreaking developments of moving segregation northward. The President was anxious, fearful even, pacing around the Oval Office with the passing hours in every day. What if he wouldn't back down? What if this backfires? Not a damned word had come forth from that powerful anti-segregationist, not a protest, not a speech, not even so much as a whisper. That is, until the Senate proceedings from the day had concluded. \n\nNews anchors across the country had all begun reporting the same story, the same flip on the entire case of segregation: now, it had seemed a small coalition of Senators seemed to be organizing in support of the legislation put forward by the Wallace administration. Legislation permitting the possible expansion of segregation of the education system in Northern states. A coalition headed by a formerly iron-willed Senator from Pennsylvania who had argued each and every piece of work supported by President Wallace. Senate leaders were baffled, the R-Ds in Congress collapsed into infighting, as reported by some newscasters. The nation seemed to wonder what could have possibly gotten Wallace the lucky break he needed after the fights he experienced in the legislation process. LeMay came into the office, noticing a wicked grin strewn across the President's face, prompting him to ask, "Any reports from the Senator?" \n\nWallace responded that "We didn't get a report; however, we got a whole goddamn bloc of Democrats voting for us in the Senate." The President and the Vice President shook hands at their newfound success, laughing at the blurry image of the Senator's face on the screen."

wallace.535.desc:0 "President Wallace had waited eagerly, anxious, and sometimes fearfully over the possibilities in his blackmail operation. One one hand, this is one of the most lowly, deplorable actions to be committed by a man in as high a position as Wallace found himself in. On the other, Wallace found the prospect of nationwide segregation to be there, laid within his palms, waiting to be clutched, for his name to go down in history as the man who overturned political ties to embrace the good traditions of the Southern United States. And that damned phone ringing was the one thing he needed for all of this to happen. \n\nFinally, the phone upon his desk began ringing its usually annoying, but now exciting for the President. "Who's there?" He asked, frantically. The raspy voice answered, "He's not buying into it." Silence persisted for a few, critical moments, moments of building fear, tension, and fury. "Why in the hell not? Didn't you push hard enough, and say something about guaranteeing this fucking guy? What happened?" Wallace said. "It's not that easy, if we keep going, we'll risk being found out. At the very least, we know one thing at the moment: he's not backing down, no matter what I threw against him. He doesn't believe in the slightest that we'd dare leak the information, that we're just 'disgusting,' and that all this would be a bluff that would blow over. And that's the censored version of what he had to say." the raspy voice responded. "Fuck, fuck, fuck. So, with all of this built up, what are our options then?" The President said, rubbing the stress out of his forehead. "In tough spots like this, this operation of ours could take two different routes: either we comply, do as he says, back down and not return until we have more dirt on him. The other direction would be to fire the loaded gun: leak the info, fucking destroy him where he stands and hope to God that he doesn't crawl back in to fight back." \n\nThe President was left in a frustrated state of stress and worry, with hopes that his heart wouldn't give out after all this. Either we swing with what we have or we back off, either way we could be absolutely fucked. The clock was ticking before the man had to hang up to avoid connection."

The leak has managed to do an exceptional job from within our administration to go on the full offense and open the pathway to the possibility of a segregated North. After so long, President Wallace shall break down the obstacles and pave his way forward after all of the infighting. Or so he had thought. \n\nPresident Wallace and Vice President LeMay sat in the Oval Office, watching the black and white screens within the television sets of the office. There, they saw speeches turned into protests turned into riots, all in the span of a day, as more people fought and bled and died within the span of a few hours. Banners waved and burned, displaying the President's face adorned with the words "Slanderer!" and "Corrupt!" As far as they were concerned, the people of America had finally been brought out in full outrage; however, not by the possibility of segregation, but rather, the rules of a game which had been played in Washington for decades. One newscaster over another described "the situation in Pennsylvania" as being pure chaos, as fights between Pennsylvanians erupt defending their Senator and his child, defending the President's actions, and the police trying to maintain law and order in the broken social situation they find themselves in. Even on the Congressional floor, Representatives postur the prospect of illegality within the actions of President Wallace, while Senators rush to defend their honor by standing behind the disgraced Democrat from Pennsylvania. \n\nPresident Wallace waltzed behind his desk and nearly fell into his chair. He nearly broke open one of the drawers, taking out a flask and two shot glasses. "Well, if we're against the world, right?" He asked LeMay, raising a glass of whiskey to his Vice President. The disgraced general grabbed the glass and downed the drink quickly, before the men rushed for another."

Whether it was fighting inside the party, dealing with the national protests, or the other issues plaguing the nation on the domestic front. Joining him, Arleigh Burke and Wilbur Mills sat nervously, doing their best to prepare for anything that may happen there. Finally, the three men walked in, causing a wide range of mild applause from the exhausted, disgruntled, and hungry men and women in the room. President Wallace took to the podium while issuing the waiters forward to begin the orders. \n\n"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for being able to attend our meeting tonight. As you all have seen, more than ever before, our party has grown under our leadership, determined to defect from the R-Ds' lackadaisical agenda to instead push it for change, for betterment. Whether it be by your beliefs or mine, we have grown strong; however, I need you to use that strength." Wallace said, as the men and women at the table brace themselves, some distracted from their orders. Wallace continued, "Many of you will protest, maybe already are protesting, but segregation of the Northern states is necessary as the National Progressive Party's next step forward. Why? Well, to be completely damn honest, I believe in segregation. And with my belief in segregation, comes the FR-NPP's belief in segregation. And with more members, our whole entire party grows stronger. So, I ask: how in the hell could we not survive for another Presidential term without this victory? Goddamnit, the people are rioting out there! Cities are fucking burning, your goddamn cities! We're better than this, so I invoke into you all the courage to rise above the principles and realize that this is about survival. I'm fighting my hardest in my time in the sun, and the sun shall rise to you all one day if you stand behind me!" \n\nThe room was silent, choked even, from the furious spiel they had just been subject to. The President stepped down from the stage, coming down to take a seat among the table, where the Senators could finally see the exhaustion of the President, as the bags under his eyes seemed to stretch further and further down his face."

After months of preparation, demographic analyses, and cross-party discussions and negotiations, the Executive Federal Aid Spending Act was forged, allowing for extended power in federal intervention in areas of state budgets, a baffling resolution on the side of President George C. Wallace, who has previously expressed his disgruntlement with federal intervention before. \n\nHowever, the confusion of the United States has not served to bring down the excitement present in the administration. President George C. Wallace strongly advocated for the success of the bill, saying, as it entered into the Senate, that "Tyranny is the death of all nations. However, we'll be damned sure to use the strength of our economy for the betterment of Americans, not the other way around." Furthermore, the National Progressive Party as a whole has remarked that the Wallace administration's success has been "a great success in the step for bipartisanship in an era of division and separation, with betterment for everyone in the country ensured." as one spokesperson for the Progressive wing of the NPP stated. \n\nNevertheless, groups of Americans have rallied in protest of the signing of the bill into law, with some of the more moderate factions of the country finding the situation abhorrent. "The National Progressive Party has cultivated, fed, and nurtured an abomination to enter into the Congress, and they happily allowed such a mischievous, gross violation of constitutional American justice to allow for a huge step in party strength." one Democrat said, waving around a banner depicting a crown atop President Wallace's head as they marched in protest. Meanwhile, moderate Progressives find themselves terrified, many citing the potential for President Wallace to exploit the naturally progressive act in order to segregate the education system further. Only time will tell how President Wallace seeks to use the Act further."
USA_sen_bill.204.d_failed:0 "Reporting live from the steps of the United States Capitol, thousands have expressed their joy, anger, and disappointment following the most recent failings of the Wallace administration within the legislative process. The Executive Federal Aid Spending Act, an opportunity to extend executive control over spending processes within the country, even extending national power over state budgets in some areas, a confusing proposal for the President who so harshly criticized federal intervention in the past. It seems as though the inherent confusion within the proposal ultimately proved to be too great of a gamble for President Wallace, as recent reports indicate the Bill's failure to pass through the United States Senate's vote. \n\nThe Wallace administration has found itself scrambling for answers to provide past the legislative misstep in the administration's history, with several teams of representatives within Washington D.C. answering countless journalists' questions, with one stating that "President Wallace greatly expresses his vociferous loathing for the bureaucracy that strangles the country of any potential good to emerge from legitimate governance." These sentiments stretch across the National Progressive Party, however, as one representative of the Progressive branch of the National Progressive Party expressed his dissatisfaction with the actions of the Senate in the goals of the party and the President, even if they typically disagreed. \n\nHowever, not all Americans appear disheartened at the President's failings in the Senate today, as the number of protests have been met with an equal number of celebrations on behalf of more moderate members of today's politics. One member of the House of Representatives, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that "The Republican-Democrat Party finds the President's lack of success in the amalgamation of the worse sides of traditionalism and progressivism to be a great victory in terms of American stability and progress." Though the country remains divided, everyone is alert for the potential future after the administration's failure in Congress."

And yet," continued the President, "we don't have nearly enough support from the C-NPP if we intend to get this bill signed into law. Now, you're not some dumbass, Pepper, you know that there's more in this bill for the both of us.

In recognizing the bill, we both know that it's going to do a lot for this country; however, there are a few, well, precautions, we wish to take before issuing our support of the bill." Claude Pepper said, much to the ire of the President. "You see, President Wallace, a specific section of the clause establishes the executive branch's power to, and I quote, 'assert direct control over the budgets of education centers.' And, well, Mr. President, given that you're you, and that I'm me, we both know what this comes down to, in regards to the segregative material of the bill. Take that out, and you have yourself a deal, Mr. President." \n\nIt took all of the President's willpower to not slap the man in that very instant. However, Claude Denson Pepper escaped the Oval Office, having made a handshake and having heard a very soft 'Goodbye' on his way out."

This freedom obviously comes in the form of our representative democracy here in the United States; however, President Wallace and his administration have taken to a more economic interpretation of the nickname, as constant work has been put forward to free the American market from federal intervention as much as possible. However, today stands as a landmark for the President's successes, as the State Financial Independence Act, also called SFIA, which intends to cut incredible amounts of federal infrastructural intervention, has come to pass in Congress. \n\nOn one side, the administration has collectively cried to joy, as constant fighting back and forth between the legislative and executive branches have finally made some leeway in the success of the Act. President Wallace himself commented, stating that "Americans across the country will enjoy unprecedented economic freedom, without the worry of regulations, rules, and governance from Washington D.C. any longer." Meanwhile, several Democrat and FR-NPP Governors have offered their conjoined support for the President and the State Financial Independence Act, with many claiming that the capital held a stranglehold on their potential workings towards the American infrastructure for years. \n\nNevertheless, large swathes of the population find outrage with the passing of the bill, and many have protested the legislative branch itself, claiming that it's become bullied by President George C. Wallace. Ardent Progressives of both parties and blue-collar workers came together to oppose the passing of the bill, with one Republican representative offering a statement, saying that "President Wallace and his entire administration seek for nothing more but the abandonment of the American people, because he intimidates, he's a bully!" Besides party divides, many economic analysts have stated that the drastic turn for the American economy will take time to tell its benefits and misgivings."
USA_sen_bill.205.d_failed:0 "The country stands, once again, divided over the current political atmosphere, with contentment over failures and disappointment over successes happening each and every day. Of course, with the Wallace's administration's failure in Congress to succeed in passing the State Financial Independence bill, many are once again up in arms over the matter, whether navigating the uneasy atmosphere of the White House, the joy and anger of several businesses, or just witnessing the reactions of the populace from one's own home. \n\nThe Wallace administration has showcased a great deal of displeasure with the actions of Congress for a long time now, and with the failure of one of the largest cuts of federal restrictions on businesses in the United States, contempt from the President and his cabinet has only grown stronger, as several members declined questioning over the matter. Meanwhile, several company heads have expressed outright enragement over the failure of the bill, with one company representative stating, "The United States House of Representatives and Senate has had it out for the President ever since he stepped foot in office. Now, they'll even keep us in this chokehold of regulations and bureaucracy, and I, along with my shareholders, can hardly take any of it anymore! What's there for us?!" \n\nHowever, not all are as disgusted with the failings of the President to pass the State Financial Independence Act. Many supporters of federal intervention, as well as many coalitions of blue-collar workers have voiced their thanks for the President's failures, with one representative of a Construction Workers organization in Pennsylvania saying, "President George C. Wallace thinking he's going to magically save the economy by clearing his work schedule is not going to help anyone in the United States of America. Now, we all have the ability to receive all of the funding we need to help our states prosper without the abandonment of the United States government." Several political analysts have recorded that the failure of the State Financial Independence Act will cost a significant blow towards the President and his administration, but only time will tell if these failures will persist in the future."

Nevertheless, such interpretations have risen to the occasion to meet the President's success today, as official news has broken out that the Education Financial Reorganization Act, known as EFRA, has successfully passed through the Senate and has been signed into law. The Act will completely sever federal ties to education centers' budgets, with one hundred percent of the schools across the country now having their budgets directly tied to their state government. \n\nThis reorganization of the balance of powers has delighted the Wallace administration, with several key members of the administration already calling for celebration having seen that they have generated joy among the states rights proponents of the country. Treasurer Wilbur Mills himself spoke of the issue today, saying that "President Wallace and our administration recognizes the rights of the states to maintain control over the customs and regulations of their school centers, including their budgets. The Education Financial Reorganization Act will help all those schools tied up in the bureaucratic mess of Washington to find a new and prosperous future in connection with their states." \n\nHowever, while strong proponents for state freedoms celebrate, others, including some within the education system itself, have produced sharp criticism of the President. One prominent member of a Wisconsan School Board, who asked to remain anonymous, declared that "President Wallace's despicable new act is going to choke the life out of hundreds, maybe thousands of schools across the United States! These children need help for God's sakes, not just to have their government drop all responsibilities for them, especially when some are already having to live in a state of financial crisis thanks to the Wallace administration's effects on the economy!"

There, the Education Financial Reorganization Act, meant to virtually cut all federal ties towards education budgets within the states, failed to pass through Congress today, thus maintaining a direct tie of schools across America and the federal government's budget. \n\nThe Act itself had significant support from states rights proponents both within the government, as well as outside of, as many protests declaring a degree of disgust with the Senate have shown. President Wallace refused requests for interviews; however, Treasurer Wilbur Mills of Arkansas made the situation directly clear for those outside of the West Wing. "Today marks a sad day for those wishing to uphold a degree of power for the individual states within our great country, as it appears that the investments of politicians have come to overrule the individuality of our countrymen. President Wallace, the entirety of the cabinet, and all of our support are greatly uncomfortable and disappointed with these recent reports." \n\nHowever, while the White House has issued declarations of gloom, despair, and scorn, groups within the United States have been shown to be celebrating the failures of the administration's proposed act. "This is a victory for all those supporting the government." said a principle of one of the largest school centers in Chicago, Illinois. "Our school, our very students rely on the funds granted to us from a federal level. Now, we get to maintain our success through those happy to pay to see these school-children succeed as the next successors to our great country." Newscasters have already captured clashes between school administrations as well as protestors of the failure of the bill, who have gathered across schools en masse and even withheld their children from attendance."

President Wallace, evermore diligent on his fight to achieve greater powers for the state governments in this country, effectively pieced together a bill that passed through the Senate today requiring a complete overhaul of the police forces of our country, establishing a requirement for each state to maintain a force of police which are constantly active, alongside a "Local Defense Division" to serve as a local defense force within the state, whilst freeing regulations regarding the activities of these police forces and their methods of enforcement. The country, as a whole, however, remains heavily divided on the issue. \n\nThe Wallace administration finds the American Defense Reorderment Act, known as ADRA, to be one of the crowning pieces of legislative accomplishment for President George C. Wallace. The President addressed the nation regarding the success of the Act, saying, "The American Defense Reorderment Act will allow the great people of this union of states to maintain law and order however they see fit. Furthermore, the Local Defense Division of each state will guarantee a level of security and defense not handed down from Washington D.C. as has never been seen before." The establishment of the LDDs has already inspired several thousands of applicants looking to potentially enlist to serve their state and country. \n\nHowever, the rift has grown widely in the country, as many find ADRA to be a direct violation of the status of the United States as a strong world power. "ADRA is a stain to the ability for the United States to stand as a global world power!" one furious World War Two veteran proclaimed in a protest in Washington D.C.

However, the small gap of federal funding has been noticed, and now, with further history of the American education system being made today, the Southern Education Promise Act, also called SEPA, will direct the little remaining funding towards Southern schools, where the Wallace administration has stated it needs the most help. Others, however, remain skeptical. \n\nOn one hand, we have Southern schools and state leaders, who, from the swamps of Louisiana to the beaches of Florida, have remained in celebration over the new bout of federal aid. "President George C. Wallace has called upon the powers of the American government to bless the South once more." said the Governor of Georgia today. "Whereas many Presidents would overlook the needs of the cultural masterpiece that is the South, President Wallace has come to our aid once again." The President and the administration remains in celebration, and whispers of a meeting between the President and several Southern governors are circulating. \n\nHowever, while some have come together to celebrate, others have found that SEPA reeks of suspicion in their mind. One hardline leader of the Republicans, Colonel John Glenn spoke at a press conference just a few hours ago, saying that, "The Southern Education Promise Act is a clear indication of President George Wallace's intention on supporting segregationist policies, whether it's written in the law or not. These states are handpicked for additional funding as they refuse African-Americans from their doors, and it's just gross, it's wrong, it's un-American, and, most importantly, it's just a sad display in the modern day.""

Perhaps due to the gears of Washington, or perhaps due to the chains to segregation, recent reports indicate that SEPA has failed to pass through the Senate. \n\nThe Wallace administration has reportedly held a meeting in regards to the immediate fallout of the failure of SEPA, and where the administration ought to direct its attention to in the next step for reform of the education system. In particular, one press official from within the West Wing stated outside the White House that "President Wallace is constantly adherent to the needs of America and her people.

Due to the direct focus of funds towards school's practicing unlawful segregationist policies through SEPA, many groups have figured that the bill was far more concerned with legislating support for segregationists in the United States. "Yes, President Wallace and his administration sit behind the veils of 'states rights' and 'Southern support,' but we all know what's truly evolving in his mind." said one Civil Rights activist.

On the other side, Civil Rights activists protest and claim unconstitutionality as the President edges closer and closer to the upholding of segregation within the United States. It is clear, however, that Congress has bent to the favor of President Wallace today, as the Local Transportation Freedoms Act, guaranteeing the States to have the right to mandate segregation aboard public transportation systems, successfully passed through the Senate. \n\nPresident Wallace himself, having been cheered as a "national hero for the empowerment of the States and Americans across the country" in some marches, remains ecstatic regarding the passing of the LTFA and its effect on the public transportation systems across the country, as numerous press conferences across the country has detailed a buzzed and joyful attitude floating through the White House. "President Wallace, as well as all of us in the Cabinet, feel as though we ought to do our best for those Americans who support us," said one press official, "and we intend to stand by our maintaining of privileges and powers for the States of this Union, whether its economics, defense policy, or segregation!" \n\nHowever, a distant cry echoes out, miles away from Washington D.C., as countless Civil Rights groups have gathered to criticize the LTFA and the Wallace administration's work to generate such a law. "What the President is doing is just, just, outrageous!" cried one Civil Rights leader amidst a march in Michigan.

"America is our home, just as any other red-blooded American gets to say it's their home.

However, while some cheer for the actions of the President in the south, others claim it to be just one more step towards segregation in America. \n\nIn particular, news journalists have taken to the streets to investigate the words and actions of educators themselves to witness their opinion on the matter. For example, Mississippi High School Social Studies teacher Matthew J. Browning has said that "Our family and I are greatly celebrating regarding the issue, considering that we can finally move up in the world and quit relying on paycheck to paycheck. Whatever's going on about segregation isn't my business, I'm not on the board of administrators, am I? Sorry to those kids, but I've been working with scraps for the past few years now, President Wallace has given us a blessing here!" \n\nHowever, not everyone is so ready and eager to shake hands with the President regarding SEBA. In fact, the open protests from school districts across the Northeast of the United States has broadcasted a sense of disappointment and fear for all the opposition of President Wallace. "First we get our budget completely slashed, and now they're going to pour everything they have down and all across the South, where they're telling African-Americans no at the door!

However, in a strange act of reform, the Wallace administration has found it pertinent to push for reforms regarding the curriculum of the education the children are receiving, with some apparently having said that "a reinforcement of American ideals and belief is what is necessary for the success of this country's future." Thus, the National Educational Curriculum Reform Act, or NECRA, has issued a set of reforms to bring education closer to history and the United States' involvement in the world, such as the Second World War, and other reexaminations of events, such as the American Civil War. \n\n"I don't see how anyone could dislike this. We're going to be teaching the youngsters about the strengths of this country, and how they ought to be proud of it. What's wrong with all that?" President George Wallace stated in a press conference following the passage of the bill. Many in the Far Right have congratulated the President for his senatorial success in passing NECRA, believing that these educational reforms will promote the American spirit, and encourage a greater devotion to their country than "some within this country right now could ever hope to know." \n\nMeanwhile, groups of teachers have assembled in several areas to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with NECRA, and other educational policies of President George Wallace. "Just because President Wallace has a knack for encouraging patriotism at every corner does not mean he can force that down every child's throat! Besides, challenging current systems are a pathway to growth, not an encouragement to stand against their country!" argued one math teacher from Vermont, leading a group of mathematics teachers whose jobs may become endangered due to NECRA's requirements demanding more history teachers across the country."

However, the Senate was not prepared for such a bold move on behalf of the President, and shot down the bill this morning. \n\nThe Wallace administration has recognized the failure of the Congress to move forward with NECRA and promote the historical reform; however, many within the administration have displayed that cabinet meetings and other workings towards new plans have demonstrated a reluctance to quit. "We have recognized the Senate's cynical lack of faith backing the country, and recognized that we must assemble different plans to promote a patriotic backing for the greatness of this country. See, unlike Congress, at least we remember our history and how to grow better." said President Wallace, before a group of newscasters stormed the President for questions, while he walked away. \n\nWhere the President has caught a rather nasty mood from, however, some teachers across the country feel the failure of NECRA to be a breath of relief for them. In particular, Science and Mathematics teachers have given word to their celebration, due to NECRA's overall focus on the promotion of American history over all else. "I love this country as much as the next guy, hell, I support President Wallace on that one. But we have to face facts: if NECRA was passed, I might have been out of a job!

Through time immemorial, people referred to the United States as being the land of plenty, where anyone can do anything they wanted, all while making the success for themselves and their families that they desired. President George C. Wallace has shown his desire to uphold this notion, and has taken a step towards promoting the land of plenty ideal through the Local Business Relief Act, or LBRA, which offers an immediate flat tax relief towards local businesses and their owners, cutting control of the United States federal government from its own economy further. Whilst some praise President Wallace for his intentions to create an independent economy, others find it just another hole to fix in a leaky economic crisis. \n\nThe Far Right have joined the Democrats today in celebrating a potential victory in the name of a free market, as small businesses have already rushed to work harder and produce more than before the tax relief. Just down the street from our news station, a local grocery market store owner was seen rushing to their business with a truckful of appliances and registers to upgrade the efficiency of his business. "LBRA is a culmination of the logical reasoning backing President Wallace," says Treasurer Wilbur Mills in a press conference today, "and we will continue to take these sound steps for the sake of the American people!" \n\nHowever, the state of the American economy following the Local Business Relief Act hasn't caused happy cheers for all. Stock owners have begun to notably scramble their investments following the Act, as local investor's offices have continued to receive phone calls regarding shifts and changes in future American finances. Meanwhile, public welfare advocates have assembled en masse to combat support for the Act, with one Republican leader saying, "America doesn't need to open more pitfalls regarding the help of its people and government.

This notion is precisely estimated to be what put the nail in the coffin of the Local Business Relief Act, a bill proposing for the immediate implementation of a flat tax relief on small and large companies across the United States, which was shut down this evening as it passed through Congress. \n\nPresident George C. Wallace, as well as several members of his administration, have all met today regarding proposals for new ideas in how to address the growing difficulties of the American economy.

"Yet, all Congress seems to want to do is make it harder for everyone." \n\nHowever, supporters of the federal government against recent shutdowns of federal power have exclaimed joy following the failure of the President, with factions throughout various Progressive camps regarding President Wallace's failings as a benefit to all of America as a whole. "The money that pours in from the taxes that the LBRA was looking to lift is the money that goes into what little care the federal government provides for the sick, the injured, and the dying.

In particular, many have voiced their concerns over the sheer level of payment going towards the DREAM Act, and continuously worry regarding the potential loss of other government programs to make up for it. "Look, I'm not one to get political a lot, but how can I help myself to not get mad knowing what I have to run?

Throughout the halls of the Progressive offices both in the National Progressive Party and the Republicans, many have found themselves taking a breath of relief. "I mean, we sit here, and we work our ass off guaranteeing that Americans still have a powerful enough government to back them up when crap hits the fan, you know?

However, whilst economic hardships have spurred the United States government into reaching out to the average citizen, President Wallace has deemed such actions to be detrimental to the American economy, issuing the American Welfare Concentration Act, or AWCA, which will immediately cut non-working Americans from Welfare programs in the future. After much debate over such a controversial bill, however, proponents of a more conservative nation have won out once more, putting an end to a variety of unemployment programs. \n\nThe recent changes at the hand of the executive office have delighted the President and the entirety of the Wallace cabinet, whose great desire for more independent local governments have produced this strong cut to the welfare programs of the United States. "In earnest, President George Wallace, myself, and many other of our associates within the administration simply can't find where AWCA produces such a hard loss for America, if any loss at all." stated Treasurer Wilbur Mills in a press conference today. "Getting leeches off of the back of hardworking Americans who have toiled for years to benefit themselves and this country? Sounds like a victory for all of us, don't you say?" \n\nDespite the strong celebrations on the end of the Far Right, other political groups have found the passing of AWCA to be disastrous on the front of both Civil Rights and Social Welfare. Progressive organizations, in studying the effects of AWCA and what it could potentially produce in the United States, have labeled the Act to be extremely detrimental towards the progress of modernization within the United States, with some figures claiming that it may take years to earn the hard work back. Others, particularly in the Civil Rights movement, have claimed the Act to be an attack against unemployed African-Americans across the country, with one Civil Rights leader saying, "The United States has led a campaign of racism in the lack of employment opportunity for African-Americans. Now, while Wallace gloats at a 'freer economy,' we all sit here, unable to get work, and unable to get any help. It's despicable, it really is.""

On the other side, and the President's side, you find conservatives tearing at the brim to combat the establishment of Social Security, desiring for Americans to fight themselves to earn their own pathway to success. In this case, the Senate chose the side of progression, as they shot down the American Welfare Concentration Act, which would cut unemployed Americans from the ability to participate in federal welfare programs. \n\nThe rebellion of the Senate away from siding with the President has left the administration of President Wallace in a state of besmirchment upon their other successes regarding economic reform. In particular, many Far Right proponents have performed a variety of speeches known as "Welfare Whipping," which seek to criticize the Social Security system for supporting unemployed Americans while advocating for support for President George C. Wallace. "Of course he doesn't want some ridiculousness like bending over backwards for not having a job! When I didn't have a job, I got told 'Sorry, bud.' and made a living myself!" said one of these Welfare Whippers. \n\nHowever, others inside the American political sphere regard President Wallace's financial failures as a brimming success, as many Progressive groups have come together to plan out the next plan of action for enacting Social Security progression. "The President doesn't want to give out these acts cause that may just have to mean helping out somebody else for once, including the unemployed African-Americans in this country.

Glenn, we need to talk..." \n\nJust two days later, and President Wallace found himself across the desk from the famed Ohioan senator, praised for his service, his dreams of the stars and stripes, and his never-ending charm. "So, Mr. President, what is it that I can do to serve you today, sir?" Glenn asked. "I'm glad you asked, Glenn, cause we have a lot to discuss up here. Tell me, Glenn, how cold does it get in Ohio?" Wallace said, rising out of his chair and wandering towards the window. Glenn had to sit back and think about the odd question the President asked. "Well, sir, it can get quite chilly up there in the winter, why do you ask, sir?" \n\nWallace shot his eyes back towards Glenn. "Cause that's just how fucking cold I feel proposing this Union act to the Senate, and if I don't get some more support from Republicans like you, then I think I'll just be freezing to death, now won't I?" Wallace said, pouring a glass of whiskey for himself and the Senator. "Ah, so hospitality for votes. I understand your bargain, Wallace, but we're gonna have to get something in return for all of this, sir. Throw in a few lines regarding Social Security and we have ourselves a deal here, sir." \n\nWallace could hardly contain his frustration regarding Glenn's demands. If he gave in, that would mean he could jeopardize his status as the strongman of the party, able to get the NPP to the Presidency like it never had before. If he refused, AWUCA could be left alone, and end up dead in the water. The silent room only rang out with the noise of a glass, as Wallace edged it towards Glenn, asking for him to drink once more. \n\n "Sorry, but I'm not the drinking type, Mr. President.""

In this desire for the care of servicemen, the LeMay administration managed to construct the greatest expansion of the G.I. Bill to date, adding several expanding chapters which include a growth of pensions for veterans of the Second World War, as well as a controversial chapter to explicitly introduce African-American servicemen as beneficiaries of the G.I. Bill. Eventually, as the dust settles, LeMay finds pride in his success through the Senate, as the chapters stand approved. \n\nPresident Curtis LeMay, in an act of self-satisfaction and pride of his country, stands as one of the most happy in the eventual passage of the bill. Having been harassed regarding the needs of African-American veterans, and the overall need of veterans as a whole, President LeMay has used the opportunity to throw together several celebrations alongside figures in the military high command as well as veterans throughout the countries. "Though I appear to you as Commander-in-Chief, know that it is I who seeks to serve you, now, after all your years of service." \n\nHowever, as all things within the span of the Wallace and LeMay presidencies, nothing can stand without the potential rise of controversy in its wake. In particular, Progressives throughout the country have criticized the Far Right's focus on veteran social standing when all of the country has been put through economic hardships, some of which they say "comes from the Far Right's insessance of a free market."

President Curtis LeMay, a man known for his service to his country above all other political schemes, worked towards the expansion of the G.I. Bill to grow benefits towards veterans of the Second World War, as well as several chapters working to include African-American servicemen into such benefits. However, despite the dedication to their country, the Senate refused to agree upon the bill, and thus left it as a failure. \n\nThe administration alongside President Curtis LeMay can be, in witnessing the Senate's refusal to sign the chapters of expansion towards the G.I. Bill, appalled. Appalled over the failure to pass such a bill. Appalled to learn of the failure of the country to its veterans. Appalled in seeing the thousands of veterans out there who suffer, day in, and day out, hurt by political scheming taking precedence over humanity. "How could anyone call themselves a patriot in acknowledging that they have destroyed simple aid towards those who gave themselves over to fight the Nazis, to fight the Japanese, to fight tyranny and despots themselves?" President LeMay said, regarding the failure. \n\nHowever, despite the shaming remarks lashed out by the President, many stand proud of their defiance of the Far Right. In particular, many sects of Progressive wings sought to stand against President LeMay and the administration inside the White House, claiming that the President's actions had only been an opening into furthering Wallace's Far Right ideals. "LeMay doesn't know what he's doing out there, and yeah, maybe he wants to look good for all those who served their country.

The constant fights have exhausted Americans throughout the country, with the clashing coming to a head as the military has come under fire for being regarded as racially segregated and, thus, without justice to all Americans.

Throughout the country, African-American veterans of the Second World War have gathered, some back into their old military units, to celebrate President LeMay's long-needed reforms.

We did what we had to do, and the government finally recognizes that other African-Americans will do as well." said one African-American retired Lieutenant, having fought in the Army. \n\nHowever, despite the generally well-received nature of NAFFA, others remain statuesque in their desire to stand against the Far Right's involvement in the government, even if a lack of apparent organized protest has occurred. "I am just as willing to support African-Americans in the military as anybody else, I stand alongside any African-American fighting for justice throughout society. But I can't support the Far Right handing out anything else and looking to get something out of this goodness."

"If Senators wish to exclude African-Americans from service as we wish to maintain, then that is their duty. But mark my words in knowing that I have fought dearly for you, the young Americans who seek to serve their strong, godly country." African-American veterans of the Second World War protested the acts of the Senate, having organized marches upon the steps of Washington D.C. \n\nDespite the lengthy efforts of the President and his administration in working towards the progressiveness of the United States military, some remain silently proud regarding the Far Right's senatorial failure. Many groups have claimed several statements regarding their support of African-Americans looking to serve their country, but their outright refusal in bending towards the desires of the Far Right. "All LeMay wanted was to look nice so that he could put in the next big Far-Right hammer of oppression.

Today, President George C. Wallace signed an executive order which directly implemented the Southern Education Promise Act, designed to funnel what little remains of federal education funding towards Southern states, which was in response to the "emergency situation which has torn apart Southern education," according to President George C. Wallace. \n\nThe Wallace administration, along with scores of groups of its supporters, have stood strong in the face of criticism and public ridicule facing the outbreak of the news regarding the executive order. "The legislative branch is not necessary, seeing the emergence of the Education Financial Reorganization Act displays a clear allowance for executive control over the systems of funding for centers of education, and seeing the tremendous emergency brought upon the South, the administration and I find it both pertinent and important to directly enforce the Southern Education Promise Act via the will of the executive branch." said President Wallace in a press meeting following the enacting of the executive order. \n\nHowever, some cliques within the United States political sphere have fought fiercely against the President's order, ranging from politicians donning the podium to protestors taking to the streets. "Wallace and his cabal in the White House are destroying every bit of fairness and equality in the education system, all because he's a stuck up, backwater racist with a fetish for the South!" shouted one protestor on the streets of Chicago.

Today, President Wallace signed an executive order which would fundamentally implement the policies of the National Education Budgetary Act, or NEBA, which would drastically cut federal funding of education whilst retaining it as a federal matter, on reasons that the changes in federal aid through the Executive Federal Aid Spending Act would allow for the executive passage of such an act. The storm over the United States, however, shows mixed feelings in this regard. \n\nPresident Wallace and the entirety of the White House administration have come out of the executive order feeling a sense of pride in their actions. The President himself gathered to the podium regarding his actions in signing the executive order, saying, "While everyone in my administration and I cherish the ideals of states rights and hold them dear to our heart, it is with all good will that we seek to make the large financial cut across the board, in order to give each and every American more room to grow themselves out and make their own great supporting factors to our economy." \n\nMeanwhile, however, another sentiment has strewn across the opposition towards President Wallace's executive order: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. In that, several sects of fringe Far Rightists, some would even say Fascist-influenced groups, and leaders of education have cried fury in regards to the President's great overreach, each taking to the streets with banners and poster-boards to signify their thoughts.

This is why the Department of State has decided to approach the both of you in proposing an alliance of trade security between the two of our nations. While the Germans have continuously impacted the state of the Union's economy, the Japanese regularly tear down our economic securities, thus prompting the following plan drafted by the most brilliant trade analysts the United States have to offer: in addition for the growth and spread of American-based businesses into the Iberian Union to stimulate economic sources from metropolitan and suburban areas, the United States will officially work to scale the importation of raw steel materials from the Iberian Union by one hundred and fifty percent. This will allow a raw financial boost towards the Iberian economy, and in exchange, the United States hopes for the Caudillos to downscale the ongoing trade relations with the Empire of Japan, to secure a more positive, economic outlook for Iberians and Americans alike. \n\nWith complete respect and honor towards your rule, \n\nGeorge C.

Thus, we shall organize an immediate increase in the importation of Canadian oil by one hundred and seventy-five percent, in order to benefit the American civilian and military economies while helping to shape the petroleum industry within the Canadian economy. While the drastic nature of the upscale in importation may seem rushed and immediate, it is within the best interests of both of our countries and our liberties to do so, under the threat of the Japanese Army and Naval forces as they grow throughout the Pacific.

It is with great honor that we not only wish to guarantee such a trade agreement with the Australian government for the sake of the horrors of the past, but also in order to lay the foundation of a greater, more secure foundation of our nations' economies in conjunction with one another. The federal Department of State has reviewed the prospects of the Australian continent and found a variety of wondrous opportunities available to connect the two of our countries into a sense of brotherhood in an already brightening future. Thus, it is my honor to announce a new opening of the American markets towards Australian goods; most specifically, the American government is seeking to increase the purchase of Australian steel and steel-related goods by tenfold current estimates.

Wallace said, moving over to try to look over the speech. "You see, sir, the points you make within the body seem to come off as, well, inherently contradictory towards one another. In one paragraph you appeal greatly towards the larger businesses and corporations for 'producing thousands of jobs for good Americans,' while further down you make a note to point out 'the strength and power of the American workforce in being able to resist falling into business traps that suck the independence out of every day of one's life.' It just isn't possible to do both, sir, and quite frankly, it's down to a matter of choosing a side regarding the argument." As much as Wallace hated to acknowledge it, but he was going to have to choose a side regarding the economic argument on behalf of the FR-NPP. On one hand, the big business leaders in the United States offered unparalleled growth for the economy with the slashing of federal restraints, and could offer much greater opportunities for Americans while pleasing the conservative body of America who wanted the market to remain as free and open as possible. However, on the other hand, therein lied the key to monstrous success regarding sewing together the factions of the National Progressive Party, while also managing to please the Southerners who didn't give a damn about larger businesses so much as supporting themselves on a local level. \n\nMills and Wallace sat for what felt like hours, as the unbearable tension of a party-changing decision was set to rock the United States. Mills really had become a central part of a "grand economic plan" as President Wallace himself stated."

The report showed a detailed graph of a continuously rising line, only to begin tapering off. "Popularity report as measured within Louisiana." The next one, South Carolina, then Georgia, then Florida, all saying the same decline. "Fuck!" President Wallace said, as he rocketed from the chair across from LeMay. "Goddamnit, what do we do now!" He boomed into the room. "Well, sir, the reports, don't necessarily sign a death warrant for us yet." He said as Wallace turned to his Vice President. "What do all of these states have in common?" He asked, as he took out a bible from the President's desk. \n\nThe presentation was about to begin at Madison County High near Jackson, Mississippi, with the Governor of Mississippi, a Baptist Pastor, and thousands of people behind them gathered to try to capture and witness the mysterious event. The Governor stood up to the podium, announcing to the crowd, "Good afternoon to the great and powerful citizens of Alabama! President Wallace has decided to renew his duties as President to the people of Mississippi. President Wallace and Pastor Martin?" The Pastor and the President both stepped forward towards the microphone, as Wallace laid his hand upon the time of the Bible. "President George Corley Wallace Junior, do you swear by the Christian God that you will uphold your duties as President of the United States?" the Pastor asked. "I do." the President said, as some found it hard to contain their applause. "Do you, President Wallace, swear by God to maintain a firm and powerful hand against the powers which seek to undo our God-given freedoms. "I do. There are those in this country that stand to undo our freedoms, and I will not bow down to them!" The cheers grew stronger. "Will you use the powers vested in you by the constitution to uphold tradition and morality in a corrupt and dangerous age?" "I do, Pastor Martin. In fact, I swear not only by God, but by each and every one of you that I shall fight for your rights, your freedoms! I am no limp-spined politician, I am a believer, in God and in this country! If you want segregation, you shall have segregation! You are Americans, and blacks will not go where you say not to!" \n\nThe citizens gathered abandoned their respectful silence to collapse into fervent applause and cheers for the President of the United States as he stood strong, with his hand gripping the Bible at this point."

Reig continued. "Absolutely, sir. You see, my Democratic constituents and I have all noticed a theme of President Wallace's presidency: a distinct turn towards radical notions to attempt to force freedom, rather than guarantee it." Goldwater said. "To continue, the Republicans have felt continuously disconnected from President Wallace, sir. Just this past week he unleashed fury to the people of Mississippi, riling everyone up without uniting the divide. It is not right to see the people rage against one another over schoolkids." Glenn continued. "Now, if I may ask, have you seen this anger firsthand in the American people?" Reig asked. "Unfortunately, whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, or even a member of the NPP, it has become evident that Wallace has unleashed this anger across the United States in order to maintain segregation, and in the process has undone his guarantees of freedom for his party's goals!" Goldwater stated. \n\n"Now, gentlemen, while I do not wish to invalidate your points, what of the possible merits found within the actions of the President?" asked the newscaster. "Sir, Mr. Goldwater and I have realized a grave matter that appears to have been lost to many supporters of President Wallace's administration. We are an American people, be it Conservative or Liberal, facing a world of crisis and scorn, of difficulty and suffering. And President Wallace's administration has decided that to solve these issues, he will bar children from schools." Glenn finished.

Recently, the Wallace Administration forwarded a piece of legislation called the Education Rebudgeting Act towards the Senate in an attempt to rebalance funding towards schools across the United States. However, the Supreme Court has declared the bill to be unconstitutional, and cited that the bill is filled with obvious setbacks against African-American schools throughout the country, and has been said to be a "deliberate attack on the African-American population's rights and freedoms in the United States." as said by one Supreme Court Justices. \n\nHowever, despite the protest from the Supreme Court, Wallace's base of support has found no wrong within the administration's piece of legislation. President Wallace himself responded by accusing the Supreme Court of "attacking his rights as leader of the United States in repairing the broken education system of the United States by directing funds towards provenly efficient centers of education, rather than the unneeded schools that leech from the budget." Supporters of the FR-NPP have stood behind President Wallace, as many have come to the steps of the Supreme Court with a variety of chants and banners, some demanding that the Supreme Court to stop acting so politically and to realize that the President is working for "the more patriotic American people." \n\nHowever, the black community has stood in defiance of Wallace's supporters and stood with the Supreme Court. Many have found anger with Wallace in his actions, actively protesting the President and various NPP associations due to their distrust of the party with the President's proposal. As said by one African-American man, "This is the United States of America. Not Germany and not Japan, we are here to find justice for all, how do we dare accept the actions of such a vile attack against the already small education provided for African-American children?" Some larger cities have even reported work protests and strikes supporting the Supreme Court against the Education Rebudgeting Act."

The President said with laughter in his victory. "After all this time, all this debate, the Justices of the Supreme Court have come to the conclusion that, once again, my administration is working towards a better America. An America without a crippling amount of debt incited by useless schools that could be closed down anyway." He said, walking away with some key members of his administration. Many across the South have expressed their happiness with the bill's passing, saying that "whether it hurts the blacks or not, we're taken care of, and that's what the President knows matters. God bless that man." \n\nHowever, some have taken a grave amount of solemnity in knowing the President's successes. Many members of the R-Ds and the Central branch of the NPP have stated their overall disgust with the approval of the act despite the "obvious constitutional issues of targeting a specific race in legislation." as said by one Chicagoan who came to D.C. to protest. The African-American community have expressed their absolute resolution in ensuring the President does not interfere with their lives longer, and have begun a wide range of protests to the clauses of the Education Rebudgeting Act.

Barely surviving, this means that the Act with accusation of attacking African-American schools with a slash in budget has become approved, even if by just barely. While many members of the administration have called the approval of the bill to be a "rousing success for the education system and economy of the United States," many in the nation have voiced their anger over the process. \n\nAcross the country, many within the support base for President Wallace have expressed a direct dissatisfaction with the process in which the bill happened to be passed, declaring that the Supreme Court's "audacity in challenging the bill to be a disgrace on America's morals as a strong and righteous nation." Despite ongoing efforts by the Wallace administration to win over the South, many small, organized groups have found that Wallace's system simply cannot get done what it desires to, and thus have defected to even more radical positions within the NPP. \n\nAcross the pond, however, the more liberal minded population of the United States is not any more happy over the failure to destroy the piece of legislation as it moved on, citing the closeness of the vote as being "a disgrace on the freedoms and rights guaranteed to Americans." Following this, record numbers of voters leaving the NPP to join within the R-Ds has been reported, as many have found disapproval with the NPP as a whole after the actions of Wallace.

Thus, before debate of the approval or failure of the bill within the Congress even started, it was killed by the Supreme Court Justices of the United States, denying the right to restructure the funding of school across the United States in the manner presented by the Wallace Administration. \n\nThe Wallace administration has expressed embarrassment and anger towards the decisions of the Supreme Court, declaring that the Supreme Court has "entered the political sphere with injustice and unfairness in mind to accomplish their own agenda." as quoted by a Washington aide accompanying President Wallace today. Many within the FR-NPP have expressed their dissatisfaction and anger towards the Supreme Court today as well, and found that "we have better options to look towards for leadership and guidance if President Wallace cannot free the education system from the clutches of urban scum." In doing so, many radical groups have also begun protests of the Supreme Court's decision, and rallied former members of the FR-NPP to join their ranks. \n\nHowever, not all are innately dissatisfied with the decision, as many Republicans and Central members of the NPP have expressed their satisfaction with the actions of the Supreme Court over the past few days.

This time, however, President Wallace and his administration has coordinated efforts with state and local leadership to produce laws which will lay down the same effects of the act while bypassing the Federal Government. \n\nThe President's administration has labeled the opening of another fight from the Supreme Court to have to be "wrongful and politically charged at best, without consideration for the well-being of the nation."

LeMay and Mills each took turns confusingly looking at the President before turning back to look at each other. Finally, Mills asked, "Excuse me if I don't understand, sir, but excites you so much about the Governor's statement?"

Some gathered to clap, yell, and applaud the former Alabama governor, some had gone to march against the President's expected speech, and some, well, they gathered to enjoy the spectacle that would be the speech on the situation in America today, as explained by their President. \n\nFinally, President Wallace, stepping up to the podium with a face ranging from confident at best to uncomfortable at worst. "My dear Americans, I welcome you to the capital on this cold afternoon to remind you of your President's duty. Duty, as I've said before, is a word bathed in subtley, its meaning undermined by the likes of those wishing to undo the greatness of our nation in their ambition. As we've stated time and time again, our good country remains ridden with this plague as its symptoms continue to rise." The President said, as some in the crowd braced for what they knew was coming next. "Yes, this is evident in the lack of options towards segregation of the school system and workplace; however, beyond this, our nation has seen these issues rise in the healthcare system, as the sick, injured, and handicapped of our nation suffer at the hands of the icy grip of federal intervention. Manipulative bureaucracy seeks to twist and turn the path to health, while the top minds of American business seek to create a new, fair, and economically sustainable option for the citizens of the future. Moreover, we see a continuous trend of declining local power at the hands of the lowly heads of power here in Washington D.C., reaching all the way to the American economy as more and more restrictions are constructed to prevent the people of the United States from succeeding in their freedom. My administration will do all it takes to work above and beyond the federal paperwork cemented by years of unmoving, uncaring political manipulation. To support the States. To support the workplace. To support the schools. To support you!" The President remarked. \n\nAfter years of backlash and anger from the American populace, President Wallace was finally able to hear a noise which invoked a sense of beauty in his mind: silence. Followed by widespread applause, with only a small crowd to protest."

Finally, the protests that had been plaguing the surrounding area was beat backed, to allow the patriots to the speech's front. Walking down the hall along with a few officers of the Alabama State Police, Mayor Boutwell greeted the President with an awkward smile, shaking his hand with a cordial "The people of Birmingham are waiting there for you, Mr. President." \n\nWallace and the state police seemed to burst out the door of the Mayor's office, inciting a roar of applause and cheers for the leader of the United States. Stepping up to the microphone with a wide, toothy grin, saying "Good morning to the great patriots here in Birmingham, Alabama!" as the crowd grew louder and more fervent. "Having served in the United States capital, I can guarantee you one thing, my friends: the federal government is rotten, from the inside out. Everywhere I've turned, the leading Senators all the way down to some of the aids are looking to constrict your rights, whether it be your work, your right to bear arms, all the way to your damned ways of life! As a servant to the American people, I cannot bear to witness such injustices happen to all of you, no matter what politician may want to choke the rights out of you. Segregation is a right! Segregation is a choice! And my administration will not only allow this choice, but enforce it as well: as we seek, the top minds of the military of the United States is aiming to reorganize the protective forces within the mainland of our country, with the protection of state-bound militias, created and organized to guarantee your rights and protections from the hands of these political wrongdoers! I will not stand for your rights, written in the Constitution of the United States to be gutted! I stand with you!" \n\nAs the President exploded upon the podium at Birmingham, his most fervent supporters cheered on, even bringing in some of the stable minds of the R-Ds. However, all the way in the back, those looking to protest continue to try to get closer, only to get beat and pushed back by the Alabama state police."

wallace.152.desc:0 "Within the heart of Georgia, the metropolitan area had been booming and bustling all week. President Wallace was making a trip down to Atlanta itself, and the people of Georgia could not stand to see a President unwelcomed. The flash of fireworks, the waving of banners, the sweet smell of barbecues, and the trumpeting of marching bands, President Wallace was all the rage across the capital of Georgia, and there would be no calming down until he delivered the speech everyone awaited for, a speech praising the state of Georgia for its safeguarding of the rights of true Americans. \n\nThe noise and ruckus around the city served to worsen the headache of President Wallace that morning, but to the people of Georgia, he only offered smiles and handshakes to these patriotic citizens. Finally, in front of Atlanta City Hall, President Wallace mounted the podium to begin his segregated serenade, with a clear "Good morning to the patriots of Georgia, and thank you for coming out on this bright and beautiful day!" The crowd cheered heavily for the President. "You know, ever since I was a little kid in Alabama, I had known one thing: America is great, and Americans are the country's source of greatness. Everywhere I looked, hardworking men fought in the workplace and on the frontlines, doing everything they could for friends, family, and country. Yet, as I grew up, I saw within the lawmakers of Washington D.C. certain parasitic qualities: they loved that work, but wanted all the profits for themselves!" The crowd immediately roared in support. "My fellow Americans, you are a citizen of a state and the union, you are Georgians, you do not deserve your greatness spoiled by some bug in a suit in the country's capital! It is my life's work, my God-given duty, to secure for the state of Georgia the rights and liberties it needs to give you all the freedom you deserve! It is not a question of the politicians as to whether you wish to say 'halt' to the negro at the door; rather, it is the question you ought to decide for yourselves! Your liberty is justice, it is righteous, and I refuse to allow some liberal, federalist wacko in Washington to deprive you of your rights so he can look good on the sunday paper! You are Georgians, you are Americans, and I stand by you!" \n\nWith the conclusion of the President's speech, the people of Georgia were in a frenzy of support for the President and his words that day. The bands played, the hamburgers and hot dogs were cooked, and the African-Americans were thrown out of restaurants."

wallace.153.desc:0 "Wallace had another difficult day of fighting his enemies and his allies, and with the sun already set, he figured he could enjoy some time in the Oval Office with his wife, Lurleen, since he barely had time to see her anymore. "So, you think you won them over in Georgia?" she asked. "Oh, the people there were ecstatic, they loved it, here, it's coming onto the news now!" The President said, giving a hug to his wife before turning on the television set in the darkness. \n\n"Good evening, everyone, this is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, here to talk once more about President Wallace, this time in Georgia on a hearts and minds campaign. I'm joined tonight by Dr. Sebastian Roth, a political analyst working with a Republican-Democrat office just an hour down the road from the rally in Macon, Georgia. From what we heard, Dr. Roth, President Wallace gave a rousing and, as the people of Atlanta have said, outstanding speech in front of the City Hall about his work to fight for the freedoms and liberties of both Georgians and all Americans. What is your response?" Lurleen playfully patted George's shoulder, giving him a look of congratulations for his work. "Well, Mr. Reig, to be honest with you, it's quite appalling that my fellow Georgians have resorted to the radical rhetoric of President George C. Wallace, sir. To be honest with you, Mr. Reig, one of the best words to describe President Wallace's actions in Atlanta is the same one whispered about him that no one wants to say: racist. Absolutely, horribly racist, hidden behind a demeanor of emphasizing states' rights." Roth's words caused the President to stand up a bit from the chair he was sitting in beside Lurleen, as her face grew a look of worry. "So, you don't believe that President Wallace cares about states' rights so much as he does to forward a, as you say, racist agenda?" the newscaster said. "Well, Mr. Reig, I do believe that President Wallace does care about states' rights; however, only until it comes to butt up against his prejudice. I mean, let's look at the facts here: President Wallace has made moves in the direction of enforced nationwide segregation, even in the Northern states, where next to no one wishes for segregation. That's not a big guarantee on democratic law-making for the states, is it?" \n\nThe noise faded away as the couple looked at each other, Wallace torn apart by the response on national television. "I'm sorry, George." Lurleen said, as he gets up, walks down the hall, and falls asleep silently in the bedroom, his wife slowly getting into bed, feeling his exhaustion."

wallace.201.desc:0 "After working tirelessly to guarantee the economic rights and liberties of the people of the United States, some always found a reason to complain. President Wallace had received call after call that he "turned his back on large businesses" and that "the NPP was going broke with these welfare programs." However, as much as the complaints annoyed the President, they generated an idea. He called his secretary, asking her to "get the numbers of the last three calls that came in." \n\nFinally, the day had arrived, and the city of Dallas, Texas was thriving just as much as it was scolding. Texans across the state saw their calendars display the day when President Wallace would appear to debate the growing farming companies overtaken small Texan farmers. And now, with the ending of the Governor of Texas' speech, the President was free to begin the debate. "Firstly, I'd like to begin by thanking all of you patriotic Texans for coming out today to support me. As seen before me, there are those in the United States who believe the success of larger businesses reach over your economic freedoms." The three other men, led by a certain Mr. Lyle, adjusted their colors and scoughed, one saying at his podium that "such a remark is rather far-fetched, Mr. President. You see, the three of us represent well-to-do companies seeking to employ such talented farmers into an umbrella communal business." Lyle stated. "Yeah, and suck the blood, sweat, and tears of every farmer here. You don't give a damn about them, you just care about their paychecks!" The crowd fired up hearing the President. "Now, Mr. President, I believe you and I know that statement to be a bit far-fetched. After all, you championed the notions of a free and competitive American market, did you not?" Lyle asked, with some farmers intrigued. "I championed the notion of a market open and free to Americans themselves, not the overgrown cesspools of greed that large companies have become." The Texans clapped for Wallace's response. Finally, one of the representatives, looking red in the face, took the stand, yelling out, "Well, Mr. President, if you're so keen on sticking out for them, why don't you tell them how you plan on affording all these handouts?" The citizens of Texas looked towards the President, who appeared flustered. The moments of silence went by before Wallace answered out, "The People of the United States are going to power the economy enough to afford it." The simple response set an even match for the debate."

wallace.202.desc:0 "President George Wallace worked diligently as each coming crisis in the United States increased his workload by tenfold. That's why the knocking on the door shocked the President and sent the papers in his hand flying. "Fuck's sakes." the President muttered under his breath, before yelling, "Come in!" Immediately, the scrawny aide named Wilson walked in with some glasses-and-suit wearing business type, saying, "President Wallace, sir, this is Mr. Lyle, an executive of..." as the aide babbled on, the President couldn't help but allow a wave of confusion and anger wash over him, who the hell was this guy looking to bust in at a time like this? And why would Wilson let him in? "Anyways, he's here for that business meeting, I'll leave you two to it!" Wilson said. "Yeah, thanks, Wilson." Wallace responded \n\n"Well, good afternoon, Mr. President, it is an honor to be welcomed here to meet with you! May I sit here?" Lyle asked, pointing to the chair in front of his desk. "Yeah, sure," the President responded, "now, what are you here for exactly?" "Well, I'm glad you asked, Mr. President, as Wilson didn't explain the situation as accurately as I'd hoped." Now the guy's making fun of my staff? Oh, what the hell? "So, my company was one of the top contributors towards your campaign for Presidency, and in doing so, you promised a wide variety of economic freedoms for the people of the United States. We greatly appreciated the work of such a candidate willing to fight for the freedom of the market, as so many presidents of the past led to restriction after restriction." Lyle continued. "Okay, so what are you getting at?" asked the President. "Well, President Wallace, we've grown quite nervous. We've seen a continuously growing trend of freedoms of large companies, such as my own, to give towards the individuals of the United States." Wallace saw what was going on here, this Lyle, thinking he can walk in here like this. "Listen here, Lyle. I've done what it takes to unite a broken party and broken nation, just cause your stocks aren't going through the roof doesn't mean the economy isn't booming more than it ever has before." Wallace boomed. \n\nTense silence flowed through the room after Wallace's intimidation. "Well, in that case, Mr. President, I believe our meeting has concluded. Thank you for taking special consideration in the matter of my associates and myself, and just remember:" Lyle continued, nearly out the door at that point, "you're going to have to make a choice." he said, closing the door."

The fact that Wallace was attending today's meeting - and paying attention - underscored the shared undercurrent of alarm and panic facing the NPP's election strategists.\n\n"Mr. President, the trend is undeniable.  We've seen a sharp dropoff in high-wealth, Fortune 500 level individual donors, and flat or reduced contributions from the major corporate political action committees.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce flat out refuses to meet with us." \n\nWallace was indignant.  "Why the hell are the businesses giving us the cold shoulder?" \n\nThe strategist shifted uncomfortably, but pressed on.  "In short, Mr. President... it's you.  And your focus on states' rights and the Civil Rights Act."  Wallace's hackles rose.  The nerve of this little man, telling him what to do!\n\nHurriedly, the leader of the Congressional NPP delegation butted in. "We're not going to get in your way of a project near and dear to you, but for the love of God, you've got to let somebody else be the face of economic policy.  Otherwise, we're going to lose the funding war, and with it, control of the agenda.""

All of the previous functionaries had either been incompetent or too political.  They'd touted their proximity to the President, and the expectation that in exchange for the privilege of access, business would need to support the Administration's more controversial policies.  But taking sides so openly had been a nonstarter from the beginning, especially as opposition to Wallace's civil rights views had hardened.  There were minimal expectations that the new guy would prove to be any better than the old. \n\nThe new business czar took his seat at the head of the table.  "I'm not here to lecture anyone.  I'm not here to ask for favors or contributions.  Politics is a turbulent business, and I know that turbulence is bad for business.  What I can tell you is that I am here to listen to your needs with open ears and with discretion - and that the Administration has given me the authority to bring your requests drive to Congress with minimal political interference." \n\nThe assembled corporate suits were still hesitant.

Even after the business community had tentatively gotten back on the wagon after Wallace had cleanly split his business and civil rights programs, there was still enough unease about the relaunched relationship in corporate America that careful choreography was the name of the game for any executive-level meeting with the White House. \n\nTalking to other Americans involved more diplomacy and felt more foreign than meeting with other OFN leaders, Wallace noted sardonically.  The minutes and bland platitudes wore onwards, until finally Wallace and his counterparty shook hands again and stood, walking towards the door.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce president leaned over and whispered into Wallace's ear.  "We appreciate the new direction of your business policies, Mr. President, despite our differences elsewhere.  I'm sure corporate America will make its approval known in ways you'd appreciate as well.""

The coffers of the national and local committees of the party were reporting a meteoric increase in the donations pledged, in both number and value, enabling NPP candidates to match their R-D opponents' campaign spending for the first time in recent memory.  With every regulation placed under executive review, or labor law taken up for watering down in Congress, the wallets of corporate America opened wider. \n\nWallace's own campaign coffers weren't benefiting quite as much, but that suited Wallace just fine.  It'd all been a quid pro quo with the CEO's - he'd get out of their way on the economy, and they'd look the other way on civil rights.  It was, after all, good business. \n\nAnd if one measured the value of one's policies by the opposition they generated, the condemnation of the NPP by organized labor, and the vigorous courting of the unions by the R-D's, was evidence enough that the tables had indeed turned.  Of course, there was the matter of the Center-NPP caucus being put in a bind, caught between their union supporters and the Wallace administration, but Wallace found it hard to care too much when the money spoke for itself."

Now, more than ever, Americans felt free to do as they pleased, maintain the business practices that they wanted, without worry of the interrupting federal government breaking them down, emboldened by the power of the states. For once, no one had to worry about their "responsibilities" towards other citizens, and could live life freely, happily, and patriotically. \n\nA sudden knock at the door interrupted the contemplative thoughts of the President, responding to the interruption with a sharp "Come in." Inside stepped Wilson, that little aide of his he always felt pitiful humor for. "A letter, for your eyes only, Mr. President." Wilson said, handing the letter to the President before leaving the Oval Office. Ripping open the letter, it appeared to be another official message straight from some Senator from Ohio. \n\n"To the President of the United States: \n\nIt is with fervent approval that we congratulate your efforts, President Wallace. Finally, the gross bureaucracy slowing the wheel of progress has been overturned, and the states have received the power they have been lacking for so long. It is not the government's role to care for the sick or injured, nor is it the government's role to win over the poor with welfare checks or 'social security,' or allow the blacks into school if the rest of us do not want them. No, Mr. President, you've shaved off those leeches and allowed the United States to march on freely, even allowing the states to protect themselves as they would like. Know that you have earned the favor of, and the conversion of, a strong coalition of Democrats in the United States Senate." \n\nPresident Wallace set the letter down and turned to look through the window once more, proud of the work he'd achieved for the people of the United States."

"And to this achievement, we must congratulate the efforts of President George Wallace in allowing our state to govern freely to the consent of her people." \n\nWallace watched the screen with awe and pride. Finally, the true patriots within the country were finally realizing the potential within the governance of the President. Wallace had not wanted to earn the title of "tyrant" or "Supreme Leader"; no, Wallace pictured the title he wanted. "Butcher." Not of people or of swine, but of the federal ties which had begun to choke the life out of the nation's economy and its people. Americans could finally take a sunday stroll without necessarily wondering if the "feds" were going to be breathing down their neck. And even better, Wallace's phone had been ringing off the hook, new, prospective Democratic senators and representatives were questioning and pondering the notion of conversion! With the executive branch in line, it was only a matter of time until the legislative was as well. \n\nWallace began rotating the dial of the rotary phone to a variety of different numbers. Eventually, he heard the phone begin the call. "Hello, Mr. President?" He heard Curtis LeMay's voice on the other end."

Plus, it got him some time away from that stack of papers on his desk. However, as he was flipping through, he realized that a particular news show had been on earlier than possible: and with a face he didn't quite enjoy seeing at any time of the day. \n\nGood evening, my name is Howard Reig with the NBC Nightly News, here with Senator Barry Goldwater representing the Democrats from within the Republican-Democrat Party. Now, you called in saying you had some words regarding President Wallace, correct?" "Oh boy, another news hour for Goldwater to have a tantrum on national television, what joy." Wallace thought as he watched the Arizonan senator. "Good evening, Howard, and to all of my fellow Americans. You would be correct, Mr. President, as it has grown more evident with the passing day that the President is wandering dangerously farther from his party's goals with every passing day." Goldwater said. "Oh, and how is that, Senator Goldwater?" Reig responded. "Well, you see, Howard, President Wallace came into the Presidency promising to 'champion the ideals of the conservative American mind,' as he stated within a speech in Ohio. However, President Wallace has turned this idea on its head, and is expanding on the federal government further than it already was. New policies and regulations slither from the federal government in an effort to further the Wallace administration, and while it is not as bad as what could be possible from the National Progressive Party, it's still a considerable threat to the people of the United States' freedoms and liberties, economically, socially, and politically. Mark my words, Howard, the proclamations of Wallace ought to serve as a warning to conservative Americans." \n\nPresident Wallace shut off the television set. If Barry Goldwater wanted to sit up on national television and spout warnings of doom and gloom to Americans, let him. It hasn't earned him the Presidency yet, and it won't in the future."

However, Wallace noticed very worrying images of rioting and arson on the television, right as the phone of his office began ringing. \n\n"Hello, who is this?" Wallace said, in a frantic, nearly paranoid tone. "Um, Mr. President, it's Byrd, sir." Wallace breathed a sigh of relief, before starting up with a yell "Byrd, what the hell is going on down in Oklahoma?" "Well, sir, it's a complicated situation." Byrd responded. "Is it the goddamn Progressives? I swear I'll send every federal fucking marshal down there to skin them alive!" Wallace screamed. "Actually, sir, it's quite the opposite: Democrats in the surrounding counties marched into Oklahoma City, joined with a few members of the FR-NPP." At that moment, Wallace's world sank around him, with confusion, betrayal, but more importantly, rage. "And why in the Sam Hell are they trying to burn Oklahoma City to the ground? That's my goddamn supporters out there doing that stupid shit!" "Well, sir, the rioters were apparently captured protesting the recent actions of the federal government. Extending federal power over their promised states' rights has spurred the local conservatives into a frenzy, with one having been captured on live broadcast stating that 'Wallace lied to us, goddamnit, we needed him, and he goddamn lied to us!', sir." With another blow to the spirit, Wallace could feel his strength wavering, feeling betrayed as he knew Democrats would tear him apart. \n\nIn his downtrodden state, Wallace muttered into the phone, "Send in the marshals." before hanging up on his National Security Advisor.

President Wallace knew he had the experience of Alabama behind him, but was he blind here in Washington D.C.? \n\n The President decided to take out a special manila folder he had stored in his desk. In it, the President compiled a variety of newspaper clippings, each detailing a different, yet equally powerful message that the President had to decide upon. In the first, the President bore witness to an economic travesty: "Henry's Diner and Cafe." A small, but powerful economic force in downtown Montgomery, Wallace even remembered bringing Lurleen there for a few dates. Shut down because of new federal health inspection regulations. The President was disgusted, how could they do such a thing to a financially successful and truly American business? The President then flipped to the next newspaper clipping. This was depicted a more political landscape; here, the state legislature was preparing to pass a variety of education reforms for an economically industrious, predominantly Christian school zone; however, the entire reform was blocked by a single vote, a Democratic state senator named Barrett, quoted as saying that "I don't believe those kids need all that money, after all, my business is suffering, why not help me?" Wallace knew that his entire party and beyond were counting on him to bring freedoms to the people of the United States. However, what if those freedoms destroyed progress elsewhere? The entire ordeal put a great deal of stress onto the President, and he knew his stresses would only get worse as time went on. \n\nThe President took a cigar out of its carton and brought his lighter's flame to the end.

That's when, after so long, the President began to add up all of the recent events and phone calls that had been pouring in \n\nConsistently, after the showdown at Tuscaloosa just a few days prior, Wallace had heard a variety of phone calls from his Far Right constituents within the Senate. "Now, more than ever," one of the more powerful Far Right Senators said over the phone, "the people are calling into my office happily. All of them feel empowered, knowing they have the right to shut the negroes out of their businesses and schools. I know it must have been Hell, President Wallace, but you sure gave them some of that Hell to get us where we are now. Thank you." Wallace happily grinned in reminding himself of his praise, knowing he had done as the true patriots of America had wanted all along. That's when Wallace thought of the idea. He gathered Lurleen, and got his driver to bring them around the local D.C. area to "check out the sights on this beautiful day." And a beautiful day it was, in Wallace's mind, as the more he looked around, the more he saw the signs. "No Blacks Allowed!," "Whites Only!," and, his personal favorite one he saw, "Afroes go down the street!" Even as he watched the streets, he knew that the United States was made White, in his image, as he had wanted it to be. All the while, Lurleen happily sat in the car beside her husband, lovingly. \n\nOn their way back to the White House, the President's vehicle had stopped at a red light. That's when Wallace got a good look at the other side of town down a large boulevard: where he saw black citizens roaming the streets, in tattered clothing and dilapidated buildings, shut out from the industrious city Wallace had just seen. And that's when the car began to move forward, Wallace never having to see that side of town."

Only time could tell for the two men as if they were about to bear witness to a bloodbath or a victory. \n\nThat morning, a group of forty-five black students departed from Druid High School, the black high school for the Tuscaloosa school zone, to march to the gates of Tuscaloosa High School, demanding to leave Druid as it emphasized the teaching of manual skills rather than promising a path to University-based education like Tuscaloosa High did, a segregated school of only Whites. Now, President Wallace stroked his chin as he watched the standoff between federal soldiers guarding the gates of the segregated school and the protesters. The gates were shut, the rifles were loaded, and each second ticked by while the possibility of a slaughter grew. While they occasionally gave off a single chant, the group of students were silent for the most part, acting as if entering Tuscaloosa High was their right, contrasting from the law. "Stupid fucking kids, they need to get back home, we don't need this right now!" Wallace said, slamming the Oval Office desk with his fist. "The protesters aren't trying to fight anyone, they've calmly approached the guard asking to finally be let in." Byrd said. "I don't give a flying fuck what those kids want. The law is the law, segregation is segregation, and they are not allowed to step a foot into that school's courtyard, Byrd!" the President shouted at his National Security Advisor. The soldiers stood resolute in the face of the wall of protesters which had formed; meanwhile, a large crowd of white adults had begun flanking the forty-five students, shouting at them, demanding they move on. \n\nFinally, after a blood-curdling hour of anxiety, Wallace felt relief as the leader of the protesters backed down, and walked the group back down to Druid High School. Local and federal authorities were investigating the matter and the students involved. Meanwhile, the President poured drinks to offer a cheer to Byrd, with whom he said "Segregation stands strong." before downing the liquor."

wallace.233.desc:0 "The President had sat down with Areligh Byrd again to go over the reports handed over by local, state, and federal authorities across the country. Everywhere they looked, they saw a similar set of circumstances: the enforcement of segregation policy had grown stronger, prompting a reaction of protest. Now, with the cycle continuing, these "protests" were growing, bigger, bloodier, and uglier. Now, metropolitan areas throughout the United States were consumed in protest, while burned in rioting. \n\n"This is going to look horrible if we give into these miscreants, these criminals." Wallace said, obviously flustered over the state of the country in the face of these dangers. "My entire party and those beyond who give support to the administration are banking on cracking down on this liberal nonsense, who wants these people around if they're just going to tear everything apart anyway? Not only that, but the economy's bound to tank with the cities under fire like they are now." Wallace rubbed his forehead after his venting. "Well, sir, we already have law enforcement units in route to contain the protests, and ordered them to maintain a level of containment over the surrounding areas which had been affected by the protests. Furthermore, while police units have been issued to the larger cities in order to suppress the riots and clean up any of the damage, the perpetrating groups appear to be far from finished in regards to their actions. Having said that, federal authorities are asking for permission to go on the offensive, to safeguard the streets. Most prominently, Sacramento, New York City, and Denver have seen the worst of the riots, and the nation's law enforcement are being deployed to these areas to put an end to the riots." \n\nWallace had known that these people were furious, destructively so, now. But he knew if nobody stood for the rights and traditions of the white American, no one else in the government would be strong enough to do so."

It would not be the stability and "small steps" of the Republicans and Democrats that would finally end the crisis plaguing the society of the United States, but rather, the strength of a true patriot. The strength Wallace felt he harbored within himself. And now, with Blacks and Whites fighting across the nation, it's time to take a stand. \n\n"These damned Blacks always did cause issues for us." Wallace seemingly muttered to himself. Nevertheless, he knew it was going to be soon that he would have to make his move. In that regard, Wallace had only one question: what was that move? Wallace looked over the reports issued in a variety of inspections conducted by the federal government, and in all, he noticed a trending pattern: whether it was by law or by practice, Black Americans were, admittedly dealing with a lot of obstacles put forward by their local, state, and sometimes federal government. He noticed reports of stores closed off to Blacks, schools segregated, all the way to social events in southern states being designated as "White only." Wallace knew that he had championed the notion of segregation and the freedoms of Americans to practice their lives as they wanted, but a creeping thought irked him all the while. What if further segregation wasn't needed? It was a question that ate away at the President, but no matter what, he knew that with the growing troubles of the age, he was going to have to move in some direction, and do it soon. \n\nPresident Wallace wanted to guarantee the traditions of the patriotic citizens of the United States; however, the question of if this meant the separation of school-children had to be done to achieve this repeatedly flared up in the Alabaman's mind."

wallace.235.desc:0 "President Wallace, the strongman of the Far Right, who dedicated a huge part of his campaign to a fiery re-enforcement and strengthening of segregation against Black Americans, was now biting his finger as he watched the South burn with protests and riots for his backsteps. The fiery, hateful rage of George C. Wallace had seemingly faded as he faced a new enemy within the South. \n\nArleigh Byrd had joined the President in watching and handling the growing situation in an effort to smother the flames engulfing the suburban South. "Byrd, what in God's name has gotten into them down there, what's sparking all this? I swear, I've given the blacks more of what they wanted, isn't it all enough!" Wallace asked in a rage. Byrd looked perturbed as he got off the phone to answer the President's question. "Well, sir, that's exactly it. It's the hardline segregationists that are protesting and rioting, sir. One of NBC's reporters managed to capture a few lines from one of them, they said that 'Wallace isn't paying attention to his White voters, we don't want concessions, we want segregation!" Wallace had to take a minute to take in the unfolding situation. "Fuck." the President muttered, while wiping off his face, trying to regain control over his racing mind. "No matter what anyone says, if it's the Blacks or the Whites, we aren't going to allow some hardliners to push us around, Byrd. What's the status of law enforcement in the affected areas?" The President asked Byrd. "As far as we can tell, dozens of units of local and state police forces have been deployed in the suburban areas where the riots are taking place, and others are swerving around to deal with some of the smaller protests. Reports of arson, vandalism, battery, theft, and more have exploded in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia suburbs where the states have tried to handle the riots, while federal forces are on their way to further suppress the outbreaks of violence." \n\nThe suburbs, places of industriousness and the growth of the family, now engulfed in the fire of hardliners. Wallace could only hope that the situation was handled quickly for the sake of America."

wallace.236.desc:0 "Once again, in a Presidency seemingly full of televised conflict, President Wallace's eyes were glued to the television as a standoff grew more tense by the moment. Beside him, Byrd was on the phone coordinating responses with the Army National Guard as well as piecing together coordinated movements by local and state law enforcement. Plastered all over television stations, the country watched as rifles were loaded and American stood against American. \n\nNear the border of Texas and Arkansas, a Texan Army National Guard base stood strong. However, arriving from nearby suburbs, a group of hardline segregationists and racial groups, calling themselves the Vandals rallied near the gates of the armory, challenging the federal government due to their softening of policy regarding segregation and the softer approach to Black America as a whole. In response, the Brigadier General commanding over the base deployed a Military Police Platoon to meet the Vandals at the gates. Now, the two groups stand in the middle of one of the tensest showdowns of American history, as the Vandals creep forward could transform the area into a bloodbath. Meanwhile, in Washington, the White House, and the President inside, was fuming. "Those are Texas-born Guardsmen, Byrd, not one of those bastards ought to touch one of them!" Wallace screamed. "I understand, sir, but they can't just let the Vandals in, they can't turn the countryside into a slaughterhouse, they're just stuck sir." Byrd responded. Wallace and Byrd watched together as the standoff, which had been going on for about two hours up to that point, inflated the fears and anxieties of the men. \n\nAn hour later, a breakthrough for the country occurred: the leader of the Vandals backed down as they saw the potential reinforcement of another platoon of military police. Rather than risk the gunfight, the Vandals broke apart, retreating from the potential battleground. Local, state, and federal authorities are investigating any links to the Vandals and its members. On the other side of the country, President Wallace handed his National Security Advisor a cigar to celebrate their sustained victory."

wallace.237.desc:0 "President Wallace took a good long time to enjoy the sunny, breezy day that he knew God had blessed him with. The road here was not an easy one, especially now that it's been a little while since the Vandals had their little standoff with the Texas Army National Guard. It was at that moment, as he looked out, that he realized a distinct truth: he hadn't heard reports of a riot in weeks, not even a protest. For the first time in a long, long time, President Wallace was able to enjoy himself for having bridged the gap between Americans, even if he wasn't personally the biggest fan of it. \n\n Rather than his own support from the Far Right call him, instead, a crowd of moderates had called and congratulated him for how he handled the standoff in Texas, saying that "the tactical mindset presented by Wallace in his handling of the crisis surely earned their vote from him." While he hadn't heard much from some of his hardline friends, he couldn't help but not care: America was finally moving forward, even if by just a little. President Wallace had felt such strong emotions after the past few weeks that he decided to capitalize on his good mood: he was his own man, and with it, he snuck out the White House, telling his secretary to call him in case anything pops out. Wallace got into his car, and decided to drive around the local Maryland cityscape. There, even though it wasn't his preference, he saw the fruits of his labor all around: blacks and whites convening in the same stores, eating at the same restaurants, and even working together to give a facelift to old black neighborhoods. The new America was something to behold, the President thought, happy about it or not. Wallace continued to drive around the area and enjoy himself. \n\nOn his way back to the White House, Wallace happened to stop at a red light next to a formerly segregated school. There, he saw a white crossing guard welcome in a little black girl for her new classes to start. The President offered a small smirk as he began to drive up the road."

Martin Luther King Jr. stands before a wall of police, with a small army of his ilk at his back. He knows he's lost today, that they won't let him protest in the National Mall. He yells, not bothering to use his mic, "Before I leave here today, I have only one thing to say: I am a Man."\n\nThe crowd disperses, the police lower their riot shields, and the city of Washington D.C. is once more at peace. President Wallace knows this is only the beginning, his segregation bills will not go along without incident. Returning back to the White House, he picks up the phone, ready to call the one man with the ability to stop this Civil Rights movement before it can truly gain steam."

The radicals in this movement seem to think that even the Yankee states aren't going far enough and advocate armed resistance against any pereceived discrimination and police brutality. In spite of how fringe and radical this revolutionary ideology should be to all reasonable people, this movement has been gaining members and new local chapters at a worrying pace, as your support among the general population and recent policies have given grounds to radical groups among the urban ghetto communities. Most worrying of all is the mass acquisition of arms by Black Panther groups and the practice of "open carrying" of firearms by black power militants, a practice that appears to be little more than an effort to provoke a violent incident."

Guss Hall, one of the leaders of the fringe militant socialist faction of the NPP had recently met with Black Panther leaders and promised to work on intergrating their agenda into the party program.\n\nThis sort of open working against their party's own President is far from unexpected, but still somewaht worrying for party unity, especially if Hall's methods manage to catch on with the larger part of the NPP's left wing, already known to be very dissatisfied with the dixiecrat "takeover" of "their" party.\n Also worrying are the rumors that the Black Panthers have been purchasing weapons from the Japanese through the treaty ports black market, though no conclusive evidence of such actions has yet been found."

If the Republican-Democrat Presidents before him allowed for such a program to be created there is no reason why President Wallace wouldn't do the same to destroy his even greater line of enemies. With that said, Hoover himself could very well be considered an enemy of Wallace as a man firmly entrenched in the old Republican-Democrat establishment, and giving him this much freedom to attack and harass members of the President's own party might prove to be more trouble than it is worth."

Some of them were poor, and would find it difficult to justify their presence in the neighborhood; others were members of the city's moneyed and political elite, and would find it difficult to justify their presence at such a gathering at all.  But they sympathized with the effort to keep the black population of America disenfranchised, by any means necessary, up to and including murder: and for that, the Ku Klux Klan opened its arms to them.\n\nThe discussion turned to the matter at hand: how to stop the 'civil rights' lunatics from making their idiotic march from Selma to Montgomery. How could the Klan send them a message that they would never be welcome in the South?  There would be celebrities in attendance, alongside the wicked King and his lackeys: Joan Baez, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett.  They couldn't count on the state police to ambush the marchers like they had at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n\nSo they would be more discreet: wait until dusk, then pick off the stragglers surrounding the main body of the march, each and every night.  Fear would do the rest as the dead bodies began to accumulate in ditches.\n\nThe designated notekeeper dutifully recorded the details of the plan, impressing upon the remaining Klansmen that yes, they'd better make sure the rest of their compatriots were on the same page.

He, and three other hooded Klansmen, were chasing another car, with two people inside, a white woman and a black man, that they had spotted fueling up after the civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery had begun to settle in for the night.\n\nThe Klansmen whooped, pushing their car as close to the other car as they dared.  One of the Klansmen retrieved a pistol from the glovebox and shot two rounds into the rear windshield of the car ahead. The car made a sickening swerve into the center of the road, crossing the centerline, before veering back and careening into the dirt off the road. The Klansmen cried victory, and celebrated by unloading round after round into the disabled vehicle, whose windows were soon smeared red with the blood, spurting forth from every wound.\n\nAs the Klansmen drove away, they failed to notice the black man pull himself out of the ruined vehicle, his own blood indistinguishable from that of his late companion, her body ripped apart.

What had until then been a guessing game grasping at the connections between seemingly 'unrelated' incidents was now utterly exposed, and everybody was going to be coming for their pound of flesh.\n\nWallace briefly fantasized about finding whatever lowlife had leaked COINTELPRO's existence to the Post and treating them to some old-fashioned Southern justice, but it wouldn't matter at this point.  The media and the public had smelled blood, and chasing after one person wouldn't change that.  It was time to get in front of the story, if that were even possible at all..."

But I assure you, these inexcusable lapses in discipline by a small number of federal agents are my responsibility to address, for which we will work closely with Congress and the FBI..."\n\nThe glare of the lights finally dimmed as Wallace finished his address from behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, leaving a brilliant afterimage as his eyes struggled to adjust back to normal lighting.  The entire address had been a torturous affair, with Wallace admitting, if not to his personal responsibility, to at least his indirect responsibility for enabling the abuses of COINTELPRO.  There would surely be hours of hearings on Capitol Hill and hostile congressional committees formed to investigate the FBI and Wallace's relationship. \n\nNone of this would be pleasant business in the slightest.  But Wallace knew how Washington worked: they were looking for an enemy, a mastermind to expose and condemn.  All Wallace needed to do was point them in the right direction and be helpful, claim that he'd been misinformed about the dubious methods involved in otherwise legitimate counterintelligence work.  He'd still look like a fool, Hoover would be a bitch to manage, and there'd be no political silver lining for all of it, but by playing the part of a well-intentioned party liaising between Congress and an FBI eager to save its own ass, maybe there'd be a way to find some overeager agents to take the fall..."

There'd been mistakes, surely, but none of his own making; it'd been Hoover's plan, Hoover's project, and ultimately, Hoover's problem.  There'd be more in it for Wallace if he played the righteous crusader fighting against Washington; after all, wasn't this what he'd been elected to do, to bring the fight to the haughty Yankees and the Washington mandarins? The American people needed to believe in their leaders, now more than ever, and Wallace would play the part to perfection. \n\nThe next morning's newspaper headlines dashed those hopes with a single line: "SECOND WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGES PRESIDENT CLOSED FBI FILE ON KU KLUX KLAN""

The administration is committed to full cooperation with Congress and the Department of Justice as they investigate this sordid tragedy..."\n\nAfter the televised address had ended and the camera crews had left, Wallace had stayed in the Oval Office, contemplating everything over his second glass of bourbon.  He'd already released any documentation from his meetings with Director Hoover, covering his bases; he'd said no to expanding COINTELPRO, he'd told the FBI to stop forcing its informants to commit murder, and then he'd threatned to rake Hoover over the coals for the Oakland riots.  The press had just beaten Wallace to to the punch.\n\nAnd that was the real problem.  To the press, the entire affair either reeked of willful negligence or showcased astounding naivety on the part of the Wallace administration.  Wallace wasn't controlling the narrative anymore, and he knew that history wouldn't remember him fondly for everything that had happened on his watch.

Wholly dependent on American demand for agricultural exports and capital imports, many Central American leaders had long ago accepted American political and military 'advisers' in their politics as necessary for the development of their nations, and their offshore fortunes.\n\nNot for nothing were Central American nations derided as 'banana republics,' Guatemalan President Juan José Arévalo bitterly reflected. What was this 'pact', truly? An oath of neo-feudalism, pledging their crop to the landlord in his Washington manor, while growing ever more dependent on American capital and machinery for the foreign plantations.\n\nArévalo had argued for years that true national development could only come with the self-improvement of industry and culture - which necessitated telling the yanqui that they would not receive their tithe of bananas today, for the promise of local industry tomorrow. But it was all for naught, as he had been dragged to Washington under threat of 'intervention' by his colleagues. Now he stood behind the American President, a pained smile masking shattered dreams."

Wallace concluded his remarks on the White House's Rose Garden, playing host to Central America leaders that had joined the Perth Bloc.\n\nMany of these countries were already deeply intertwined with the United States, with American demand for agricultural produce, rubber, and other strategic resources paid for with capital and manufactured goods. It was a mutually beneficial exchange, and thus it only made economic sense to bring the Central American countries into the Perth Bloc. Indeed, not inviting them might have seemed a political slight - and it wouldn't do to give Japan any political opportunities it could exploit in America's backyard.\n\nNot everybody was happy. Some of the more independently minded, leftist countries had howled about economic surrender to the United States, about yanqui domination and exploitation. Guatemalan leader Juan José Arévalo had led that charge, and it had taken explicit pressure from his colleagues - and quiet threats from the State Department - to bring him around.\n\nWallace sighed. Didn't Arévalo realize that his obstinance would leave his people behind? He could scream about self-determination all he wanted, but progress would not wait for him. The Guatemalans would realize America was doing them a favor, and they would damn well like it."

The people of India are tired from the continuous encroachment of Japanese army, naval, and aviation units throughout the Pacific and directly from the lands of the Chinese. However, although the meetings would guarantee a commitment from the people of India, and may result in the production of international treaty involving the nation of India, it ought to be forewarned that the Indian people value their newfound independence and freedom. Thus, if the representatives of the Indian people feel as though the terms do not represent the greater interests of the Indian nation, they will be immediately rescinded and the productions from the conference shall not include India and her people. \n\nMany thanks for your invitation to the conferences at Perth, \n\nThe government of the Indian nation" \n\n"My God, Fulbright, we did it, India's going to Perth!"

They won't budge on keeping certain sectors of their economy closed, at least until a detailed timetable for their opening can be discussed.

With stark reminders of the tragedies of modern history apparent through the scarred Pacific, leadership within the New Zealand government has come to the conclusion that it is more than necessary for the governments of our two nations and beyond to attempt to piece together a strengthening of our alliance in the nature of economics and trade protections. The nations of the world need to be reminded as to the greatness, potential, and prosperity offered in the realm of democracy and a free market, and with the planning of a Pacific Trading Zone to secure such ideals, New Zealand would be a proud attendant of the conferences occurring at Perth. While the peoples spread across the Pacific live in fear under the mandates produced by the harsh nature of Japan's domination in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, New Zealanders seek to promise for themselves and for others a brighter future than ever thought before. \n\nWith justice and freedom in mind, \n\nKeith Holyoake, Prime Minister over the people of New Zealand" \n\nPresident Wallace saw within the small paragraph on the statement the ideals of the Perth Conference forming.

In other words, President Wallace had been begging for a distraction from the mess of paperwork on his desk; however, the sudden slamming of three knocks against the door knocked the President off guard at the sudden answering to his request. "Come in!" Yelled the President. J. William Fulbright rushed in, approaching the desk while handing a statement to the President. "You're going to want to read this over, sir." \n\n"To George C. Wallace, President of the United States: \n\nYour proposal to unite nation's surrounding the Japanese sphere of influence is as respectable as it is outreaching for your country. Throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere, innumerable cases of suffering produced from the actions of the Japanese military and government have occurred, and it is unfortunate to have to bear witness to these atrocities at such a close distance as the Indian government must. However, an escalation of conflict with the Empire of the Japanese would produce subsequent conflicts, with the people of India in front in such occurrences. Such a possibility is not within the grasp of the Indian nation's interests, and a coalition of economic value in an effort to bring together the members of the Organization of Free Nations possibly resorting to a loss of profit in an already ailing global economy would produce suffering for a great number of the Indian population. We simply cannot allow the risks to disrupt our promises to the Indian people of a free and independent future with such ties, and thus, we will not be attending the conferences occurring at Perth, nor the results of such conferences. \n\nWith Peace and Prosperity in mind, \n\nThe Government of the Indian nation." \n\n"Damnit. Another frontline lost." Wallace said, flinging the piece of paper across his desk.

Even if it sweetens the deal for the Aussies and Kiwis, it's not as if they need roads, hospitals, or other public infrastructure that they can't fund themselves. Much of the proposal now sitting on Wallace's desk simply distributes bloc grants to the Australian and New Zealand government, operated and disbursed at their discretion.\n\nWallace scratched his head.

Arguing that the national governments of Central America have 'capacity constraints' that prevent the adequate (or uncorrupt) distribution of funding for infrastructure projects, the proposed development package places outsize importance on American corporates with a long presence in Central America, particularly the United Fruit Company and Castle & Cooke. The two companies dominate the economies of the region and their export of agricultural produce, owning shipping, transportation, and media throughout much of Central America.\n\nWallace was a business friendly politician, to be sure, but achieving a leveling of international trade through reduced tariffs was an entirely different beast from further entrenching the dominance of American monopolies in the Caribbean. If nothing else, the outsize role played by United Fruit and Castle & Cooke would squeeze out other Americans looking to expand into Central America..."

It mixes a desperate need for infrastructure with a dearth of local private capital to fund it, leaving the massive bill squarely with the American government and taxpayer.\n\nWallace could hear the pundits screaming for blood when faced with the potential cost of winning India's participation in the Perth Agreement.

The legal details were labyrinthine in complexity, but at heart, Washington wanted to ensure that American firms would not be subject to frivolous legal disputes from governments - or expropriation - without due compensation.\n\nWhile Australia and New Zealand might back the proposal, given their robust private sectors and comparable legal framework to the U.S., the Central American nations were a different matter. The dominating presence of United Fruit and other conglomerates in their economies was a matter considerable controversy among the citizenry, and the conglomerates spent enormous sums protecting their interests.\n\nThe clause in the Perth Agreement would, hopefully, put American firms at ease; and for that reason, the negotiating team expected pushback from Central America's socialist governments.

The damned Indian government formally rescinded its delegation to the Perth Conference for reasons being that 'the intentions and ambitions of the United States' leadership within the conferences occuring at Perth did not align with the benefits of the Indian government nor her people,' as stated by the cowards." Strom responded. "Sonovabitch!" President Wallace said, kicking over the chair next to him in the room. "After all of this work to earn their favor, they just ungratefully walk out on us. After literally having our children killed by Empire's wake and they don't wanna offer their help to make sure they don't burn the Pacific down again. We are so goddamned close to this deal and one of the biggest, most dominant contenders to helped us fight those fucking Japs just walked the hell out?" Wallace asked again, bent over. "Sir, I believe so, sir. However, this doesn't kill us in being able to secure a deal with the rest of the members of the OFN, sir, as they have all appeared more than reliable in willing to limit trade with the Japanese, sir." Fulbright said, attempting to calm down the raging president. \n\nTaking a deep breath, the President got up from his bent over position and asked "Fulbright, could you do me a favor, please?" "Anything, sir." Fulbright responded. "Firstly, make sure this goddamned deal gets through. Secondly, make sure those fuckers regret ever disgracing the image of the United States." The President said, slamming the door on his way out."

wallace.438.desc:0 "The long day of discussion, debate, theorization, analytics, and diplomacy had finally concluded as the Perth Conference came to end late in the evening, signifying a number of direct developments in regards to the connection of the members of the Organization of Free Nations. President Wallace, along with the entourage of American figures employed in aiding the conference, had been at the center of it all, and experienced the success firsthand. \n\nEarlier that day, President Wallace said, "Representative Muñoz of the people of Honduras will now exchange the Honduran nation's regards to the proposed opening up of American markets to the agricultural goods of his represented country." as the Honduran man approached the center of the room to produce a slew of agreement with the American notions of deals for Honduras in exchange for a restriction of trade against members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. "Strom, I have to say: I may be a southern man with strong beliefs regarding the power of our country, but I have to congratulate ourselves, we're really winning them over out here." Wallace whispered into his Secretary's ear. "I agree, sir, they're eating it up out here! Now, I have to say, sir, perhaps we've underestimated how much the Japanese pushed around the people of these countries, sir?" Fulbright said. "What do you mean?" whispered Wallace. "Well, sir, to be honest, think about it: the Japanese created Hell on Earth for the United States. Think about all of these countries, sir, who may have experienced just the same, without what we had prepared?" Fulbright proposed. At that moment, President Wallace took a look around. Everyone here had a different story of the same themes present in the United States. However, how much more devastation was wrought by the Japanese against these countries? Not just during the war, but for years, the Japanese held a chokehold against all of our economies, and when your country hardly has the finances to secure a great economy to combat their interests?" \n\nLater that day, Secretary Fulbright found the President sitting out of his room, a single hand resting against his chin. "Mr. President, are you alright?" Fulbright asked. "Strom, we are going to get this Pact created, we have to. Not only do the Americans need this, but all of them in there." The President said. J. William Fulbright dutifully nodded his head in response to the President's growing fury."

wallace.439.desc:0 "While briefings were hardly a source of mirth for any President, the updates on the Perth Bloc were a rare source of good news for President Wallace. Australia, New Zealand, and Central America had joined the bloc, with discussion ongoing over the next round of tariff cuts and import quotas moving forward. Even if the details were being fleshed out by countless diplomats and lobbyists, Wallace was comfortable basking in the glow of his foreign policy success. And today, the State Department had another interesting proposal.\n\nWallace thumbed through the papers, scarcely hiding his growing excitement. The numbers were breathtaking; millions of consumers in a country that was still trying to find its footing on the global economic ladder, geographically positioned to block the Sphere's expansion further westwards. "India," he breathed, "would be a prize indeed."\n\nThe Secretary of State cleared his throat. "It's not done deal. The Indians may have divergent political or economic interests from us, and convincing them to join will be an order of magnitude more difficult than what we've done to date. Otherwise, we'll all end up with egg on our faces if they turn us down."\n\nThose words echoed in Wallace's mind. India was a juicy prize, but how much was Wallace willing to give for it? And there was still the matter of the existing Perth Bloc members, who wouldn't be pleased if the Indians were given a sweetheart deal..."

wallace.440.desc:0 "Though the NPP had no lack of spirit for fighting the Japanese, the Cabinet could do little but stare glumly at maps of the Pacific at weekly briefings. The Co-Prosperity Sphere stretched from the Azad Hind to Hawaii, boasting a colossal military, abundant resources, and the strategic depth to frustrate any advance. Realistically, America could do little but bide its time and contain the beast.\n\n"So, if there are no other defeatist observations..." Wallace grimly noted.\n\n"Captive markets?" The U.S. Trade Representative murmured. President Wallace eyed the Representative warily, leading the Representative to cough before continuing. "The Sphere's economy is both mammoth in size - and converging. Manchurian steel, Chinese rice, and Malayan rubber are shipped cheaply to Japan, feeding both the Japanese military and consumer demand in the Sphere's colonies. Whereas the OFN's presence in the Pacific is limited to Canada, Australia and New Zealand - and put bluntly, is an economic Frankenstein. A patchwork of independent economies sewn together politically, stunted by tariffs and industrial redundancy."\n\n"Are you suggesting we replicate Japanese economic serfdom in the OFN?" Wallace asked.\n\nThe Representative shook his head. "No! But if we're going to beat Japan, the OFN has to gradually open up, with its largest economy leading the way. And unlike Japan's colonial dependencies, America can ensure everybody is paid at market value - ensuring economic development and prosperity that could, one day, pave the way to both expand the OFN and outpace the Sphere economically."\n\nWallace nodded slowly. "It's a hard pitch for the unions, but if America can benefit, it might be worth it. The freer the markets...""

wallace.441.desc:0 "A hastily convened strategy session for the Perth Agreement had concluded that despite India no longer being a candidate for membership in the Agreement itself, there might still be room to look for a smaller, bilateral agreement with India. The scope of the agreement would be restricted - there were obligations to the other Perth Agreement members to give them Most Favored Nation status, and India wouldn't be getting that treatment - but small concessions, such as phased tariff reductions under strict import quotas, were still possible. The Indian government would be given sweeteners as well - cheaper access to American agricultural imports, a loosening of visa restrictions for Indians looking to enter the U.S., and industrial assistance.\n\nNothing quite as ambitious as the Perth Agreements, and America and India would essentially agree to live and let live between their various economies, with American firms shut out of the Indian market. But any ties with India are strategically valuable and worth the price, or so the argument from the State Department went."

wallace.500.desc:0 "Finally, the time had come for the President to begin collaboration within his cabinet in regards to pushing forward true legislation to generate a better society within the United States. Wallace was pacing in his office as he ran through the ideas within his head, as Vice President LeMay finally came through the door to begin their meeting. "What took you so long, Curtis?" Wallace asked, fidgeting as he went to stand over his desk. "Gathering the reports you wanted, sir." LeMay said, as he dropped them all on his desk. \n\nYes. Just what Wallace wanted. The President eagerly flashed a toothy grin towards the map he saw, with red circles drawn around several states within the country. "These, sir, are the prime states to focus on if we were to initiate such a campaign. The South would be the most sympathetic to such a cause, thus, it would be most beneficial to start there to upswell support before heading to different areas. What do you think, Mr. President?" Wallace let out a slow laugh at the graphs and maps and records, with images of the possible future ahead of him dancing through his mind. The Civil Rights Act burned out of American law forever, allowing him to pursue every bit of the punishing legislature he wished to create against the blacks. "Those degenerates have been plaguing this country for so long, with only a damned few words I'd have to tear apart to let me solve this once and for all." Wallace thought. But then, dreams turned to worry. "What if it's too much? What about the risk of riot and protest, endangering the lives of the true patriots of America who aren't worried about such notions of "equality" and "fairness?" Those bastards were dug in, but then Wallace thought about just how entrenched he would become if they were to fight back. He had been to war before, literally and metaphorically, he could handle a few protests from criminals." \n\n"Um, sir, are you alright?" LeMay said, interrupting the inner thoughts and contemplations of the President. Schemes, schemes, schemes, but just how much were they worth it?"

wallace.501.desc:0 "Wallace had already cleared the schedule he would need, and organized the caravan he had traveled with. Presidents of old did it, why not enjoy the ride along the way? And thus, the President journeyed, side by side with key members of his staff, and even his wife, Lurleen. The South, the President's home, was a goldmine for support of such an act, and it was just a matter of time until they'd get the work done. \n\nThe campaign trail formed a circle around the entire South, allowing them to quickly hop from capital to capital in an effort to make sure everyone knew of the importance of repealing that damned civil rights act! The President's journey began in D.C. itself, where the President captured the attention of the public in his announcement of his journey to win over the hearts of the people so that never again would they be burdened by unnecessary legislation like that ridiculous "Civil Rights Act." Next, the President traveled out west, from West Virginia to Missouri, before heading southwards to the farmlands of Texas, where crowds cried out to meet the President and his wife, and more importantly for Wallace, tune in to the unfairness held by the Civil Rights Act. The crowning jewel of the trip was when he reached back home at Montgomery, Alabama after heading eastward, where he dined in the city hall among some of the powerful southern senators, representatives, and governors in a televised event broadcasted to drive the people of America to get their Senators to vote for repeal! Finally, Wallace journeyed up the Eastern Seaboard until finally concluding the trip back in the nation's capital, Washington D.C. There, marching bands and cannons greeted the President as he drove in, along with the thousands of southerners who had crowded the front of the White House. There, the President rose to a high up podium to deliver a fiery speech regarding "the beauty that is the green jewel of the Southern United States!" before returning to the theme of his journey, "to get on the asses of your senators and representatives and tell them: repeal that damned act! For your freedom, for your liberty, for your independence!" Wallace's screams dominated the area, giving rise to the thunderous applause of the southerners who came to witness the sensation. \n\nThat evening, President Wallace took but a little while to relax and enjoy himself, thanking his wife for going with him the whole way and making it such a nice trip."

wallace.502.t:0 "Moving Up in the World"
wallace.502.desc:0 "President Wallace was treating himself to some of his favorite foods in the whole world to celebrate his journey through the South: an absolutely lovely warm, buttery plate of sweet pancakes atop his desk as he began work for the day. As he was enjoying himself, a knock at the door interrupted the President's breakfast, calling "Come in!" with a full mouth to work with. Curtis LeMay entered the Oval Office, saying "Sorry about the interruption, Mr. President, though we are going to have to start getting work to figure the rest of the campaign out." Wallace nodded while fruitlessly attempting to wipe the syrup off his face. \n\n"Mr. President, we received outstanding support for the campaign within the South, reports indicate that approval ratings regarding the repeal have jumped tremendously from before. However, this is where things get difficult: we have a choice from here." LeMay said, while pointing to the map ahead of him. President Wallace inspected the map, noting that while they covered the entirety of the south, it wouldn't be enough to get the repeal they needed. No. They needed to expand. The next two areas were certainly not going to be easy to get through, as their options looked to be the Northeastern United States or heading out Westward. "You see, we have some issues here, LeMay. The Northeast has some strong liberal shitheads around the region, each one of them constantly pissing themselves whining about 'President Wallace and his racism.' The plus side is that the area is some of the least ground to cover, meaning that if we hit it and hit hard, everyone in there is going to hear it and get it drilled into them. On the other side, over in the West, they're a little bit, what's the word, uh, fickle. They could be swayed with a little bit of hammering hard, the problem is that it's a whole helluva lot of ground to cover, meaning a lot of resources and a lot of time. And, if worse comes to worse, a lot of time spent on a loss." \n\nThe President and his running map looked over the map carefully, looking at the benefits and problems of each trip. Either way, at least they get to get out of the White House for once, right?"

As the President was enjoying the nice rest he rarely got, he felt a calloused hand beat against his soldier. "Hey, George, plane's gonna be descending soon and we need to make some decisions about where to head next." \n\nWallace got up and stretched, causing his wife to be shaken awake as well. "Alright, you have me up now, what's the decision now, did they set D.C. on fire while I was gone?" LeMay offered a chuckle in response, saying "Not yet, sir; however, your entire support base will be if we don't get this passed, and to get votes, we have to start getting the word out. This is just about our last stop on the trip, and we need to decide where to go from here, sir." LeMay's words delivered a sense of remembrance and happiness over the past few days, feeling proud as his words branded Americans with a simple request: repeal! Wallace had to shake himself out of his daydream as he took another look at the map. "Well, uh, what's your ideas, sir?" LeMay asked, seeming unsure, which Wallace thought was usual by this point. "Well, LeMay, the way I see it, we've got another two options: this time between the Rust Belt or the Great Plains of the good ole' USA." Wallace said, nodding his head. "Both of these places are losing thousands of people a year, LeMay, let's make that clear; so, no matter what, we're going to have to hit precisely and accurately if we want our voice heard. The Rust Belt is historical for having a helluva lotta working Americans and political force behind it. Meanwhile, the Great Plains is known for its 'representation of the country's beauty' or whatever the fuck, giving it that good American look with some country folk who may feel happy to listen up to the possibility of getting that damned Civil Rights Act out of their hair that's plaguing what little business they have. Either way, we're going to have to spend a lot of resources in making our voices known out there. \n\nA flight attendant came nearing the President and the Vice President, offering a bright smile before saying in a thick southern drawl, "Please, sirs, the plane's going to be descending soon, I'd like to ask you both to watch yourselves so you don't get hurt if things get bumpy.""

There, senators point at and argue with one another over the potential skeletons rotting in each and every possible member's closets with the revelation of a small, simple letter. Whilst the President tours the journey in an effort to raise support for the repeal of the Civil Rights Act in order to push further along in segregation policy, the legislative branch bickers and argues once more over the President's actions. \n\nIn particular, reports indicate that a small leak from within the office of the President made its way to the Senate floor, where it alleged that alleged that President Wallace had been in direct contact with a variety of law-makers for the country and manipulating them to vote alongside him in the upcoming vote which prompted the nationwide tour the President is currently engaged on. In particular, the source was unsure as to whether the President was employing payments to bribe the senators into following his footsteps in the vote or if he had collected controversial information regarding the senators and threatening to publically leak the information to secure their vote; however, the leak emphasized that the manner in which the corruption was happening didn't matter, so much as though that it was happening in the first place. News teams are spread across the capital attempting to record information in regards to the chaos on Capitol Hill, but no matter what, the people present around Washington D.C. can feel the air tighten all across the city. \n\nOne senator declared that if the President really had been resorting to such acts that he be "removed from office with all due haste for tampering with the legal process." Only time may tell what will happen to the President."

Wallace gulped as he heard the enthusiasm from the newscaster. "While the nation remains rocked after finding out the potential mishandling of the legal system, it turns out that the culprit had not been the President at all: rather, the perpetrator was a member of the senate itself, of the less powerful of the Far Right winged members of the National Progressive Party, who admitted to the corruption in response to fingers beginning to be pointed at the President as he made his journey across the country campaigning for the same goal. The senator was dismissed from duties as he awaits a federal trial on grounds of bribery and corruption for his acts of attempting to force votes towards the repealing of the Civil Rights Act. Nevertheless, the actions of the senator does not seem to have slowed down the journey of the President as he travels across the countryside in an effort to earn the hearts and minds of Americans in an effort to repeal the same act which caused the controversy within the senate in the first place. Finally, Americans can get some rest after the momentous shocks that came from Washington these past few days, and instead, can prepare as the vote to repeal the Civil Rights Act comes closer and closer. This has been Howard Reig, with NBC Nightly News, signing off and wishing Americans across the country a goodnight!" \n\nWallace collapsed into the bed he was sitting up in. His name had been cleared, he was free from the grasping of the senators, and he could sleep well next to Lurleen knowing that his journey was not stopping yet."

Look, Austin, I mean it, no one, man, woman, white, or black, no one deserves that sort of treatment, especially from the President of this beautiful country himself. However, if you think representing a bunch of communists who want to tear apart the constitution is gonna help anything, you're wrong. Wallace is a radical sonovabitch, but you've got to remember, if you represent them, and it goes somewhere, you're just representing a commie Wallace, one who's gonna have the businessmen of this country on the streets like Wallace has the blacks on the street." \n\nFinally, the two's breakfasts arrived, and they ate and warmed up as best they could in the freezing Ohioan morning.

wallace.520.desc:0 "In a surprise announcement this morning, the Governor of Arkansas announced that he would be reinstating segregation in his state. Orval Faubus, passionate supporter of segregation and President Wallace, declared that with Wallace's blessing he would allow local businesses to restore seperate white and black facilities, and would be ordering formerly desegregated schools to remove all non-white students immediately. His declaration was met with cheers by a crowd waving pro-segregation and confederate banners.\n\nThis has come as something of a surprise to President Wallace, as he gave no such direct blessing for the Governor to restore segregation so soon. Not every barrier to segregation's restoration has been removed, and with Brown vs Board still technically in place the matter of resegregating the schools in particular could prove extremely legally problematic. Naturally, the Governor's decree has sparked protests by civil rights activists across Arkansas, and fierce outcry from black parents whose children have suddenly found themselves turfed out of school.\n\nSegregation is a delicate matter in this current age of America, and Faubus' careless act may cause many issues indeed."

And it seems to be a school that caused Governor Faubus a great deal of consternation once before.\n\nLittle Rock Central High. In the 50's it was the site of much furore when, after the implementation of Brown vs Board, Faubus personally attempted to resist the desegregation of Arkansas by physically blocking black students from entering the building before he was removed under direct order from President Eisenhower. Now, it is a thorn in his side once again.\n\nAfter a bitter argument between staff, black students and their parents, and with some encouragement from some sympathetic teachers, the African American kids were allowed to re-enter the school in direct defiance of the Governor's order. They have declared that they have a right to be there, no matter what "some no-good, ignorant, racist pig" might think, as one student put it.\n\nGovernor Faubus is reportedly maintaining medically concerning levels of fury, and is already making plans to send the police and even the National Guard to the school to forcibly remove the students. Such a large and, some would say, disproportionate response is certain to cause an uproar. This could get out of hand very quickly."

Faubus insisted that he had the experience and expertise to handle the matter on his own initiative, to which Wallace sarcastically remarked "had worked out just amazingly so far." Wallace demanded that Faubus allow him to put the National Guard under federal control for the operation, so as to better manage things and prevent any further escalation. He also suggested reinforcing their ranks with reserves from the US Airborne forces, believing that their presence could deter the protestors and convince them to back down quickly.\n\nNow it was Faubus' turn to be angry, questioning why a man so determined to de-escalate the situation would consider sending in military forces.

Within a few hours a massive protest had gathered, the National Guard now sandwiched between them and the school.\n\nIn scenes reminiscent of the most heated days of the civil rights movement, the crowd demanded equality and justice, yelling chants and waving banners at the armed Guard who could do naught but hold formation in front of the entrances to the school. As the clock struck twelve, the heat of the Arkansas afternoon brought the crowd to a fever pitch. A small group of counter protesters arrived to hurl abuse at the demonstrators, which only added to the tension.

As their demands for entry became more forceful, one of the guardsmen became increasingly twitchy as the leader approached him. As she cried out for equality, he snapped.\n\nHe would later claim to have felt threatened by her presence. Others would ask however an armed and armored white man could possibly feel threatened by a young black student who just wanted to learn.\n\nThe crowd froze as the shot rang out. The guardsman, his gun in hand. The activist, bloodied and dying, falling to the ground. And then chaos.\n\nSome ran in terror. Others charged forwards in fury. Now in complete panic, the other guards released more shots into the crowd in a desperate attempt to restore control. Two more young protestors would be dead by the end of the day. One brick thrown by an outraged student would send one of the guards into a coma from which he would never wake.\n\nAs the chaos unfurled across Central High, just as it soon would across all Little Rock and through America, the first journalists arrived on the scene. The images they would capture, of the blood and the dust and the bodies of students and the terrified children watching from the school windows would soon be broadcast across the nation.

Governor Faubus has hailed the resolve of the guardsmen in dealing with troublemakers, and promised that Central High would soon return to business as usual as an outstanding place of learning for white children. While President Wallace has sent more than a few angry missives his way for escalating the situation in the first place, he has conceded that the governor has handled things better than expected.\n\nA sense of unease remains across the state as well as America at large, however.

However, his eye had been caught as the door widened, and that aide from down the hall, what was his name, Wilson, came in with a pristine letter. "Good afternoon, Mr. President, they told me to directly leave you this." He said, handing the President the letter. "Thanks Wilson, go get yourself a donut." With that, the boy was out of the door. \n\nThe President tore into the letter to find a neatly written document within. "To President Wallace:" the document started. "Your efforts in the Congress and Supreme Court have been acknowledged by those sympathetic to your causes. Time and time again, national progress has been delayed or outright killed due to the intervening of federal powers, biased in their decision against allowing your administration's work to proceed into possibly promoting change in support to the traditions and morals of our country. Though many within the media and beyond have accused you of being a radical, outspoken bully, we recognized your actions to have been taken by a powerful member of our society who remains frustrated by those who take partisan sides before continuing to weigh out the true value held within, especially when you have openly and happily born witness to your willingness to cooperate and cooperate regarding the difficult issue of segregation. While the Southern States' Freedom over Socio-Educational Rights and Precedents Act produced extreme clauses, perhaps a group of ten sympathetic Democrats would be willing to discuss the matter and side in your future prospects?" \n\nThe President, exhausted as he was, could almost have thrown a party right there in the Oval Office having captured the victory within the Senate.

In particular, some folks from the Republicans and the C-NPP who share some similarly radical views, calling themselves the L-NPP are protesting the recent reforms for the education system." Wallace's jaw nearly hit the floor. "You're telling me that these mad bastards can't change to learn a little bit about how good they have it in this goddamned country? What's so bad about it, having the guts to say that it's the Japanese who need to get bombed next, or are they pissed off to learn that we have some patriotic, states-driven backgrounds? Fuck!"

The shooting occurred as the protest column were blocked from approaching the school by counter-protesters in support of the decision, with federal troops attempting to separate the two groups.  Local hospitals report that fourteen African-American protesters were killed and another thirty-six were injured, with no reports of hospitalizations from the predominantly white counter-protesters. \n\nPentagon officials declined to comment on today's events, only stating that soldiers involved 'exercised appropriate restraint in response to an increasingly violent situation.'  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has condemned the actions of federal troops, claiming that the shootings were 'the latest display of barbarity by a government that, with a wink and a nudge, violently imposes unjust segregation in the name of justice and order.'\n\nWhile Little Rock has only reported sporadic violence after local authorities declared a curfew with immediate effect, the impact of the incident has spread rapidly as protests and looting have been reported in New York, Detroit, Boston, Birmingham, Chicago, and Baltimore, with protest leaders calling for an immediate investigation into the conduct and orders given to federal troops involved in the shooting.

Even if the people are still skeptical of Wallace's good faith, the statement might be enough to tie the NPP together, buying more time for the administration to craft its defense in Congress. \n\nOthers advocate a more confrontational approach, from claiming that the entire mess isn't Wallace's fault and pinning it on military discipline, to continuing to advocate for law and order and ignoring the administration's role in the crisis.

Yesterday morning, as Little Rock Central High School opened its doors to begin the school day, a group of expelled African-American students began marching in a column towards the doors. As they marched, they were met with fierce resistance by counter-protesters looking to block the young adults from entering the school, prompting federal soldiers to attempt to de-escalate the situation. In the growing tension and rising violence, they were forced to make a terrible decision to maintain law and order, and opened fire into the group of students to disperse the combatants. The injured and dead were collected by the soldiers ordered to guard the area, in total amounting to fourteen dead African-American students and thirty-six injuries. Ladies and gentlemen, no matter who you are out there, this is a shameful tragedy that my administration is hard at work to investigate the nature and surroundings of the event. Any student being shot and killed is a terror that we wish to do away with in modern society for the United States, and it is unfortunate that as great as our country is, we must suffer as we do now.

It was an expansive list, on an aggressive timetable.  Wallace grimly noted that his administration would only be enough time to fully coordinate and lock down the stories of one of the two groups of individuals summoned - the soldiers on the ground, or the staffers helping issue the orders. \n\nAnd then, of course, there was the matter of the NPP legislators on the House Oversight Committee, and how willing they'd be to softball the investigation.

A crack; had a weapon discharged?  An exchange of harried glances down the line, followed by another crack, then screams.  The crowd surged forth.  Rifles up.  No time to aim, except at center mass. \n\nIt all sounds like a terrible accident, and we could argue as such, that the confusion and ambiguity makes any presumption of impeachable intent ridiculous.  That being said, none of that changes the fact that all of the dead were from the African-American demonstrators, and in light of that there is no assurance ambiguity will be a believable defense.  Indeed, we would open ourselves to accusations that the ambiguous orders were by design, a mobster's suggestion to avoid accountability for upholding 'the law' of segregation.\n\nWe could get the soldiers to 'agree' that they were not explicitly authorized to use force, but did so anyway, on their own judgment.  It is a clear admission of blame that lets us off the hook, but preparing the 'incentives' for the soldiers to testify in this way would be expensive and unethical, to say nothing of how the military could be affected by being made into a political scapegoat."

But legalese and government records have their own way of obfuscating essential truths, which could really only be parsed by bystanders intimately familiar with the background of their creation.  They was the linchpin; the documents were carefully couched to survive judicial review, but if the staffers involved in the drafting were asked to be entirely truthful, the words undoubtedly took a different political meaning.\n\nThankfully, there was a constitutional remedy for the question at hand: the Fifth Amendment.  Nobody, not even in front of Congress, could be forced to make any statement that might be self-incriminating in the case of the Little Rock massacre, which could potentially be expanded as a de facto gag order.  Of course, pleading the Fifth hardly provides for the best optics... but trying to force everyone to toe a party line that there was no political intent might be even worse if somebody cracks, even if it would give the 'clearest' answer possible."

Wallace was self-aware enough to know that he was quickly becoming radioactive with the Yankee-leaning, progressive segments of the NPP electorate; they would be the hard nuts to crack on the Oversight Committee, whereas the Right-NPP could plausibly be brought in line with bland promises of party unity and more control over the reins of policy.\n\nAnd for the recalcitrants?

Naturally, the NPP congressional caucus is furious.\n\nThings would be bad enough if it was just the media baying for blood and the NPP demanding action, but the nation as a whole remains roiled with anger and recrimination.

Many Representatives were caught gasping and whispering following what sounded like the commanding officer's approval of the actions at Little Rock. Another member of the unit, Corporal Douglas N.

Punches were being thrown, people were gnashing their teeth, screaming, I swore a brick almost knocked my eye out." he says. "It was all getting too bad too fast, enlisted personnel and officers were yelling just the same, until eventually someone yelled 'Fire!' and it all went,' he said, tears welling in his eyes and voice cracking, "it all went to Hell.

"The United States and the Wallace administration feel strongly in regards to the status of segregation of the education system, and the actions of the protesting students that day," one figure within the Wallace administration said, who's name has been asked to be removed for his protection, "but just because we disagree with allowing these students in does not mean that we authorize massacres to prevent their entrance." One Representative stated that they were "shocked", and said that they were left "feeling gross" about the staff member of the Wallace administration's statements, defending segregation during the aftermath of a "butchery which happened thanks to that stance." \n\nWith the house formally ending its call for witness testimony, the Representatives have officially begun the process of deciding whether to forward the collection of evidence towards the Senate as Articles of Impeachment for President Wallace."

The Speaker of the House has decided to "formally overturn the investigation to the Senate to begin a trial of President George C. Wallace in regards to his involvement within the killing of fourteen African-American Students and the injuring of thirty-six more." \n\nThe word "impeachment" rings out in a familiar tune for the people of the United States at this point; nevertheless, everyone has grown to stand firm in their beliefs regarding the massacre. "Those damned students were told to back down, and guess what: they didn't." said a protester in support of Wallace, alongside several men and women adorned with shirts saying "Wallace Will Win!" "It's not right to blame the President for the shooting, those troops with an itchy trigger finger are the ones that killed them, and those students shouldn't have been there in the first place!" However, others have different opinions in regards to the trial of impeachment for the President, as many who supported the protesters have gathered in Washington to condemn the President. "What Wallace did was an absolute disgrace for the United States. Whether he fired the shots into the crowd or not, he could have avoided this if he just let those children in!" A man screams, waving around a banner with the words "Racists Remain Responsible!" "Overall, I think there's a huge part missing for everyone supporting Wallace after what happened at Little Rock: those were school-kids. Children. Looking to walk in and get taught science and mathematics and english for christ sakes'." \n\n As the Senate prepares to formally investigate President George C. Wallace and his administration for their possible action, or possible lack thereof, the nation continues to stand divided as it drowns in the blood of fifty victims."

However, no matter what level of exhaustion he was at, anger flowed through the veins of the President, coursing through him with every flash of a camera and every reporter screaming outside of his office "Did you authorize the shooting, President Wallace?" Surrounded by a team of the best attorneys within the United States, law professors at Harvard, those who have defended previous Presidents, some of them with shiny gold awards, all of them had assembled within the Oval Office to prepare a defense for the President of the United States dealing with possible removal of office after a massacre that stained the nation. \n\n"Gentlemen, as you all know, these are difficult times that we live in, and I firmly believe that I have done what I can to embolden this nation after decades of fear and mistrust. But now, as I'm sure you've all seen, the media has turned this whole thing into a circus, with me as the biggest punchline of the joke, and with the House already against me, I need your help from the old bastards in the Senate. What can we do?" The President said to begin the discussions. And those discussions not only began, but stretched on for hours. Everyone in the White House felt like they were subject to being torn apart by the horde of news journalists and protesters that had formed within the capital over the past few days. Whether it was rocks hitting the walls of Robert Byrd's office, or when Lurleen Wallace dropped the bowl of soup she had just been made from the fright of seeing a reporter pressed up against the window behind her. The White House was torn apart, in a state of fear and anxiety as the only noises that sounded were the telephones ringing, the lawyers discussing with the yelling President behind the closed door of the Oval Office, and the onslaught of angry citizens and relentless reporters harassing the surrounding area. \n\nFinally, the President and his team of attorneys emerged from the Oval Office, akin to a group of knights looking to wage battle against the castle next door, with pens and legalistic language as their swords and shields. Now, no scare tactic from the media could slow down the defendant and his partners in court."

President Wallace looked around at his jury, the most powerful legislative body in the United States federal government, and all seemed to look back at the defendant. The senior, most experienced Supreme Court Justice had taken the head of the trial, and soon, proceedings were to begin. However, despite the ongoing situation Wallace knew one thing: if anything, do not be scared. Do not be a coward. Do not let anyone sway you to falling. If anything: be angry. \n\n "May the Senate of the United States of America rise for the Pledge of Allegiance." the Supreme Court Chief Justice spoke. Everyone rose to recite the Pledge, including President Wallace, laying his hand against his heart in pride for his nation, speaking loudly and confidently. "Please take your seats." the Judge ordered. "Today, the United States Senate will begin proceedings for H.Res.519, formally entitled the 'Impeaching President George Wallace.' In conjunction with the submittance of evidence provided by the House of Representatives, it is now the Senate's duty to proceed with the investigations of United States President George C. Wallace after the occurence of the 'Little Rock Central High Massacre' to investigate the possibility of mismanagement resulting in the deaths of fourteen students and the injury of thirty-six others."

He was an innocent man, he knew it, and if these damned Senators couldn't see it then the United States is doomed. "The prosecution, in this case, the Representatives chosen to represent the federal investigation, shall proceed in stating their opening argument." \n\nThe opening argument of the prosecution was an absolute disaster, in the eyes of President Wallace at least. Accusations of "potential action wasted by attribution of the President's fervent segregationist belief" causing the goddamned massacre when he wasn't even in the same state for it. Or, better yet, "President Wallace's administration led a disastrous mishandling of the situation which resulted in the deaths of several innocents."

After the man took his seat, the Senate responded to his opening with a stern silence. Some more inexperienced politicians may have been intimidated, Hell, even scared by the imposing sense of dread that followed. But not George Wallace. No, President Wallace stood by a single thought that journeyed through his mind: "the roaches are scared." \n\nWallace took a good long while to enjoy his first victory in what he believed would be a complete landslide of a trial. To be quite honest, Wallace thought that if there was any time to enjoy this entire ordeal, it'd be now. Sadowski leveled the opening of the prosecution with nailing the reasoning behind his innocence, and attempting to influence a return to reason for the most powerful law-making body in the free world after a complete "trial by media" already seemed to have occurred. However, unlike Dr. Sadowski, Wallace had known a fact which he held dear to his heart: there wasn't any reasoning with the bloodsucking politicians in Washington, especially when riled up against the man who tore them and their anti-American antics down. Who's to say that some of those Senators up there are plotting to not listen for the entire trial up until the final vote, where the name "Wallace" will ring out to them and they'll vote guilty? No matter, with any luck, the Supreme Court Chief Justice up there is going to ensure this remains as fair as possible, and none of the circus acts that his opposition has thrown out so far will endanger his chances. \n\nWallace knew that this was just the first battle in an entire war. Nevertheless, if this battle was won, Wallace and Sadowski were going to make sure that none of the characters in here looking to tear him down would get the chance."

Now, the trial shall move forward to the cross-examination of the witnesses. As is standard in United States law, the prosecution shall begin to cross-examination first." "Great," thought Wallace, "now they're gonna get the blacks to go up there and cry about their friends." Dr. Sadowski worked to calm the President, whispering that "until they get a picture of you with a rifle pointed at those students, you had nothing to do with this." \n\nThe first one the prosecution called up was that National Guardsman, Douglas N. McConnell, the one who was too scared to do as ordered. Some representative from New York was in charge of questioning the man. "Corporal McMconnell, you expressed a great deal of emotional turmoil following the bloodshed at Little Rock Central High School. Who would you say you're most frustrated at after all of this?" the Senator asked. "Well, you see, sir, that's a lot, but uh, you could say that frustration within myself can be pointed towards some of the men that day, but more importantly the ones who fought the protestors who wouldn't let the National Guardsmen present do their job. And, well, I'm frustrated in myself for having to have been so confused in it all." McConell responded. "Got them." Sadowski whispered to Wallace, knowing that a Corporal was raised to respect authority, and would be scared speaking against the Commander-in-Chief, his highest superior. \n\n"The prosecution would now like to call forward Mr. Percy Jameson." boomed the New York Representative. "That media sensation, the black kid who survived all the shootings. Let's see where this goes." thought Wallace. "Mr. Jameson, would you point towards the policy of segregation held by the Wallace administration against African-Americans such as yourself and the rest of your friends who died that day as being a direct cause for this massacre?" asked the Senator. "I, uh, well, my friends and I, we, um, we felt very upset about the men who fired on us that day, especially the officers out there who ordered it." Jameson responded. "Thinking that a young kid like him would point blame at the President of the United States in a room full of a hundred of the most powerful law-makers in the land, big mistake for them.""

Sadowski and Wallace knew they may have gained some ground in the prosecution's cross-examinations; however, their case can't survive on the holes within the prosecution alone, men have been sent to their deaths for less. No, it's time to gather a solid plan surrounding the next period of the trial. \n\nSadowski had generated a plan he and the rest of the team called "brilliant" as they looked like they were about to start patting each other on the back. Sadowski was going to call upon the unnamed staff member within the administration to grill into the man, and try to psyche him out into revealing faulty memories regarding anything even possibly connecting the administration or the President to the ordering of opening fire in regards to the current laws of segregation in school areas. That way, it can show a general inconsistency of information provided by such witnesses, and limiting the potential for the prosecution. Next, he was going to, of course, call up First Lieutenant Victor Thornton to the stand. Thornton already seems up his own ass about his innocence about shooting a bunch of kids; so, if we use him, we can show that the "peaceful protests" among the African-American students there were a lot more bloody than the media claims it to be. Plus, if they're disgusted, no matter what, Thornton's statements will be in pride of his own actions, distancing us from his orders in all regards if things go the other way. \n\nWallace took a few moments to think about the plan, when an idea struck him. "Sadowski, we aren't going to use the kid, Jameson?" Wallace said. "Well, we weren't planning to, why?" he responded. "Cause if we poke holes in his claims, we succeed in showing that he and the media blew his credibility out of proportion, and show that my policy about segregating they're kind is right, showing they can't be trusted." Sadowski and the legal team had to take a minute to process Wallace's radical proposal for a defense, because it could actually make sense due to the segregation argument.

Wallace forever. However, it would be unwise to treat the intermission as a mere break to catch their breath and make any last prayers. No, this intermission was to be one of the most dynamic points of the entire trial, according to Sadowski, and Wallace enjoyed the prospects of potential victory being in their grasp, no matter how desperate the situation may have been at the time. Thus, Sadowski and the rest of the team began their plotting and scheming for the President, while Wallace himself enjoyed the quietness. "Finally, those old assholes won't be on their guard.

Oh, how the taste of progress will be sweet once he claws his way out of here. \n\nOn the other end of the table, the team of attorneys were worried.

Having said that, the darker side of such supposedly "valiant" leaders of the country were beginning to show everywhere. Shadows lie everywhere when the light of the innocent is snuffed from the world. \n\n One of the attorneys on the team defending Wallace beckoned him closer to him, protecting against the inquisitive ears in the room. Finally, Wallace had gotten close enough to hear what the man was so worried about telling him, and the news he heard back was well worth the effort: some of the senators aligned with the Far Right of the National Progressive Party had been discussing voting in favor of the impeachment and removal of Wallace from office. Wallace nearly fell out of his chair, crushed over the news. The treason, the betrayal, had these senators no honor left at all? "Fucking vultures, why wouldn't they help me, they've supported me in everything that's happened so far?" Wallace whispered loudly, the lawyer seeing tears well up in the President's eyes. "Sir, the best estimate I can offer you is that if the vote happens to condemn you anyway, they do not want to be lumped in with those that wished to support you, sir." The President had to contain himself from smashing the top of the table with his fist. "This wasn't right. They were allies, Hell, some of them were fucking friends, people you'd shake hands with and talk about the big game with." Wallace thought. "Fine, fucking fine. Bastards want to kick a dog while it's down. Okay, what are our options from here?" Wallace asked. "Well, we could attempt to organize a small meeting in order to win back based on virtue, and sway them from their current mindset. Or..." the attorney said. "Or fucking what?"

Together, they saw that same unfortunate truth, and in that truth, the potential need for redirection. However, where one ally may fall, more arise. The R-Ds may be harboring promises of "stability" and "steady progress for a truly united America," however, what about the underbelly of such claims? What about those strong conservatives among the Democrats, the ones who promised their constituents a free and liberty-filled life during their time being one of the two greatest representatives of their state to the Union? What if such sympathetic characters managed to be swayed under the pleas of a bullied and harassed southerner who has fought gallantly in protecting the freedoms for the people of the United States? The media has already destroyed any sense of peace in the realm of private life, why allow the political partisanship to tear apart and genuine and honest man looking to provide a better life for the true patriots out there who hold such traditions dear?

If they catch you trying to win over R-Ds, even if they were Democrats who were close to the FR-NPP anyway, they aren't going to be happy." "A gamble.

While it was getting difficult to breathe, the President stood resolute, even as the vein pushed out along his neck. "I did everything I could for the people of America, but know, they want to paint me as some monster at the end of the day."

A news headline displaying the images of schoolchildren, dead on the steps of a large school called Little Rock Central High School. With these school-children disobeying the law and being met with fierce resistance from civilians acting as a counter-force to the children, the National Guardsmen were forced to make a difficult decision in a difficult situation. However, much to our despair, such a decision would not have had to be made if the outdated systems of the federal government and the extensive bureaucracy of the armed forces had made haste. Rather, having to pass the message along to the next person in a long chain of officials down into the military, the order was unfortunately held up by unnecessary traffic in communication centers across the country. Thus, in what should have been an easy call to make, the bloat of our government led to the killing of fourteen children, and the injury of thirty-six more. This is a disgrace of our government, of restraining the executive branch from executing just orders to stop the bloodshed from those willing to slay these children like animals. It is not right, and I, alongside the talented members of my administration, will do all we can to make sure nothing like this ever happens again, and will find out just who allowed such a bloodbath to happen in the first place. God bless the United States of America, and God bless you all." \n\nFinally, the camera clicked having finally ended the live broadcast. President Wallace asked, "Is it done?"

"President Wallace and the administration faced a great tragedy in regards to the happenings of that day," one figure within the Wallace administration said, who's name has been asked to be removed for his protection, "however, that tragedy struck in the demonstration of the inefficient bureaucracy within the government, not from the fault of the President." One Representative stated that they were "appalled and slightly disturbed" about the staff member of the Wallace administration's statements, bringing further criticism to government officials during the aftermath of an "inhumane butchery of innocent children." \n\nWith the house formally ending its call for witness testimony, the Representatives have officially begun the process of deciding whether to forward the collection of evidence towards the Senate as Articles of Impeachment for President Wallace."

It was LeMay, looking as if he was about to deliver another headache onto the President. "You're going to want to see the news, George." \n\n"This is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, and this just in, our station has received a detailed leak from within the White House regarding the televised speech the President delivered as a formal response of him and his administration to the Little Rock Central High Massacre. Delivered to us this afternoon, the leak maintained that they are a high ranking member of the Wallace administration, having personally met with George Wallace throughout his Presidency. President Wallace, however, has apparently not given the entire story from the administration according to our source, as detailed within the leak was a stark observation: President Wallace did not, indeed, enforce any form of authorization behind the shooting. In those regards, it was a terrible tragedy carried out by the National Guardsmen present at Little Rock Central High School that day." Wallace breathed a sigh of relief, who would have thought of a helpful leak? "However, the leak persisted, this does not clear the President of all wrongdoing. Rather, President Wallace and his administration had been aware of the rising tensions in Little Rock but did not act in the time needed to, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Nevertheless, fourteen children are dead and thirty-six are hurt because of the West Wing's inaction. This is where our source from within the White House ends. Having reviewed the leak, it is safe to say that-" Reig's voice silenced as Wallace shut off the television set. \n\n"What are we going to do, Mr. President?" LeMay said, worried about the President's thoughts. "Damnit," Wallace responded, "whatever rat bastard did this is a real prick. However, this isn't going to kill me in the end, should have expected this to be honest." LeMay noticed that the President's typically vigorous energy had faded, the anger petered out. "Is there anything I can do for you, sir?" The Vice President asked, concerned for the President. "Get some rest, Curtis." Wallace said, heading back to his bedroom."

Wallace felt the breath escape his body, as if someone was ready to put him to death by hanging. "The innocence of the President is a lie perpetrated to the people of the United States. President Wallace and his administration had not suffered under a slow communication system, and thus the criticisms of the federal government and military were unwarranted and baseless.

President Wallace sat nervously, clenching his fist until his knuckles grew white, almost frightening Dr. Sadowski. The numbers hardly mattered as they were muttered out of the old man's mouth, only two things mattered: the first "Not Guilty" verdict, counted by another count of votes, followed by the second declaration of "Not Guilty." \n\nWallace could hardly contain himself after hearing the Chief Justice utter those beautiful words, using the energizing victory to raise a victorious fist in the air. After a few pictures, Wallace took a great amount of time to shake the hands of each and every attorney on the legal team, with an especially emphasized expression of thanks offered to Dr. Sadowski for managing to bring together the case and beat out the United States House of Representatives and Senate to achieve a secure victory for him. "How do I go about paying you back after all of this, Doc?" Wallace asked. Sadowski responded with a prompt, "Why thank me? The history books will do that. Along with the paycheck." All around the defense, however, the Representatives in charge of bringing the President to trial shared looks of shame and bafflement, as if each were asking how on Earth did Wallace manage to slip out of that one. No matter what though, Wallace was quick to show face by giving thanks to all that stood behind him. This was only emphasized when the President walked outside alongside his team, greeting the team of reporters he usually shooed away. This time, all the news stations would hear the proclamations of innocence by President George C. Wallace. \n\nAfter returning to the Oval Office to complete the rest of the workload cut out for that day, the President of the United States retreated to his bedroom with his wife Lurleen, where they enjoyed a night filled with a word the couple had not heard in months: tranquility."

President Wallace found himself feeling a mix of dread, anger, and a feeling of sadness that edged along the lines of despair. Next to him, all of his attorneys sat nervously, especially Dr. Sadowski. The men could hardly focus, but by the end, they all heard two distinct phrases: "Guilty," followed by more numbers, followed by a returning "Guilty." \n\nPresident, or, Former President Wallace's heart sank deep into his chest upon hearing the words fly from the Chief Justice's fat mouth, prompting the man to lower his head to the table he sat at. The President of the United States, for the first time in history, formally removed from office after a trial initiated by the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. And for what, miscommunication in the middle of a disaster? Former President Wallace had been escorted out of the building as the Senate came to be dismissed and the trial proceedings officially concluded. Outside, a microcosm of the entire United States was shown: half of the crowds were cheering and crying in success over the removal of Wallace from the Presidency, while the others appeared silent, seemingly destroyed over the loss of Wallace. In the White House, several men worked to help gather the President's belongings and personal effects to be brought out of the White House. Inside, Wallace shook the hands of his closest cabinet members, but could hardly bring himself to face the rest who looked up to him as a leader. As the man set on changing the face of America. The President George C. Wallace, leader of the FR-NPP and the strongman of modern American politics, forced out of office by law. In one of his final acts inside of the White House, Wallace shook hands with soon-to-be President Curtis LeMay, his former running mate and Vice President, before leaving alongside his wife, Lurleen Wallace, destined to arrive back home in Alabama. \n\nGeorge and Lurleen lied down in bed in Montgomery, Alabama, watching the swearing in of President LeMay. "I swear, within my duties as President of the United States, I swear to rectify the mistakes of the Wallace administration and settle the great rifts of our nation. I can only hope and pray to remain a man in better standing than Former President George Wallace." Wallace responded by turning off the television and rolling over to go to sleep."

"Great," thought Wallace, "now they're gonna get the blacks to go up there and cry about their friends." Dr. Sadowski worked to calm the President, whispering that "until they get a picture of you with a rifle pointed at those students, you had nothing to do with this." \n\nThe first one the prosecution called up to the stand was Corporal Douglas N. McConnell, the one who was too scared to shoot. Some representative from New York was in charge of questioning the man. "Corporal McMconnell, you expressed a great deal of emotional turmoil following the bloodshed at Little Rock Central High School. Who would you say you're most frustrated at after all of this?" the Senator asked. "Well, sir, it is without a doubt the handling of the entire situation that has me the most perturbed, sir. It just seems like President Wallace almost allowed those poor kids to be shot out there, I'm not sure if it's that extreme, but I can't help but wonder." McConnel responded. "Shit." Sadowski whispered to Wallace, worried over the Corporal's continuous tearing at the President. \n\n"The prosecution would now like to call forward Mr. Percy Jameson." boomed the New York Representative. "That media sensation, the black kid who survived all the shootings. Let's see where this goes." thought Wallace. "Mr. Jameson, would you point towards the policy of segregation held by the Wallace administration against African-Americans such as yourself and the rest of your friends who died that day as being a direct cause for this massacre?" asked the Senator. "Segregation has proven time and again to incite anger and violence across the United States, sir. Not only in the past, but even now, as the blood of my friends stane the steps of my former high school" Jameson responded. "How the fuck did they get one this educated to represent them in the country's capital?" Wallace whispered angrily."

Thankfully, the prosecution had no suspicions regarding the witness; however, Wallace and his legal team had done great work in ensuring that, as quoted by some fancy scrawls left for the man to find on his door, "if his two kids ever wanted to hear about their father Victor again, then he'd best make it look like Little Rock was planned." \n\n"The defense would like to call First Lieutenant Victor Thornton of the second platoon in the 216th Military Police Company."

After initial greetings, Dr. Sadowski asked, "First Lieutenant, do you have any statements in regards to the buildup to the massacre, such as any motives from any parties involved?" The First Lieutenant nearly froze, before coughing and saying, "The, the shooting at Little Rock Central High School was, was a planned and intentional attack against the gathering students by the high command of the Arkansas National Guard." The Senate Chamber seemed to freeze perfectly still for a mere moment before exploding into chaos and disorder. The Senate was appalled by the First Lieutenant's account claiming the massacre was a conspiracy to slaughter students, and the Chief Justice called for order to return to the Senate Floor. "All according to pla-" thought Wallace, before being interrupted by a Representative strongly crying out "Objection!" Wallace's world froze, but he wasn't finished yet. "Your honor, this man's claims are a direct contradiction of official statements offered in regard to the investigation of the massacre; furthermore, the witness's physical, mental, and emotional faculties appear to have degenerated over the course of the trial, signaling the possibility of witness tampering. Permission to clear witness of duties, sir?" Wallace saw the grave stare of the Chief Justice as his world seemed to fall apart at the worlds of some Representative. "Objection sustained." The Chief Justice said, with the slamming of a gavel. \n\nEven seated at the table, Wallace felt the burning eyes and venomous whispers shared among the Senators, each adding fuel to the fire which burned Wallace inside out.

The First Lieutenant looked as if time had become frozen, before stating, "The massacre at Little Rock Central High School was the result of direct miscommunication with superiors on my part.

"Your honor, this man's claims are baseless within respect to the investigation conducted of the massacre; furthermore, the witness's emotional faculties appear to display a form of paranoia, signaling the possibility of witness tampering and faulty testimony. Permission to clear witness of duties, sir?" Wallace thought and prayed that the Chief Justice would remain calm in the face of the lady calling for Thornton's removal. "Objection sustained."

But before we hold this critical vote, I believe we need to discuss what really matters. I come before you today to speak about a subject very dear to my heart..."\n\nIt became immediately clear that this was indeed a filibuster. Rather than focus on the matter at hand, the senator began a lengthy reading of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, his favorite book from his youth. Despite the ridiculousness of the situation, filibuster is of course a protected practice. His voice was clear and driven, and at no point did he falter, leave for the bathroom or do anything that could bring the filibuster to an end. Even worse, lain out in front of him was a myriad of other reading material - it was clear that he was in this for the long haul.\n\nAside from giving in to the filibuster, we have two main courses of action. We could attempt to call a cloture vote - a vote to end the filibuster and immediately ratify the agreement. However, this requires us to secure a two-thirds majority. As time goes on, more and more people will be eager to see this filibuster come to a close, so an alternative is to wait it out until we can be sure we have enough support for a cloture vote to pass."

How do we possibly move on from this? How can this possibly be anything other than a colossal failure for my presidency?"\n\nThe Perth Free Trade Agreement was delivered its sentence today, as the Senate finally dismissed the proposal. With the Bloc dead in the water, the delegations of the other nations have already begun leaving Perth to return home, quietly cursing the wasted effort. President Wallace has not been seen in public since the defeat, as he seethes over the tarnishing of his economic magnum opus.\n\nMuch of the opposition to the bill came from within the NPP, with much of the Center and even some of the more protectionist Right coming out to cast their votes against it. In the eyes of the voters, the failure of the NPP to come together to pass a measure that was already widely unpopular amongst a large amount of the general public has only further exposed the fractures in the party. The optics of this defeat for the NPP are certainly grave indeed.""

In Perth itself, the delegations present were finally able to ratify the Perth Bloc into an official institution of free trade across the Pacific and beyond.\n\nIt will take some time for the effects of the free trade zone to be felt. Major international corporations are currently in feverish talks with foreign governments and businesses to organize deals and expansion into overseas markets. There are already some promising signs, however, with the Dollar surging on the stock exchange as the markets respond positively to this historic development. The opportunities now open to American business are vast, and many business executives are currently occupying themselves with champagne and celebrations.\n\nAmerica is sure to gain much influence over the Pacific from the agreement, which will surely help beat back the grip of the Rising Sun. Though many of our voters are still leery over the impact of the PFTA, they will surely see the benefits soon. This is a great day for American business, and for the National Progressive Party."

However, the presidency itself comes with caveats, one of which is that campaign promises are often only half-fulfilled. \n\nThe C-NPP, the general progressive party of the United States, begrudgingly supported Smith during her presidential campaign, and now expects her to support their pro-laborer demands. Under their leadership, and with the support of the Smith Administration, the C-NPP could unravel the President's business support, killing her chances at re-election.

Consequently, economic progressivism has seen a massive resurgence in the C-NPP and other groups, and they have become so vocal about their rhetoric that they are now impossible to ignore.\n\nPresident Margaret Chase Smith is famously pro-employer, but should she wish to pass some of her legislation, she must gain the support of the C-NPP. As outright pushing for pro-employee policies is out of the question, the President believes that better relations between businesses and laborers is the most effective and prudent solution to the problem.

All-in-all, the United States of America is in bad shape.\n\nLuckily for the States, however, it has a president and congress who mostly recognize the issue, and are willing to do anything to put an end to it. While President Margaret Chase Smith wants most Americans to have access to welfare programs that would allow the poor and infirm to get back on their feet, she also knows that the federal budget could not allow for massive expansion of welfare.

Yet, for decades, women have been refused leave from work to care for their child following birth. For such a crucial time in infantile development, precious little attention is given to it by the law. While it is true that some employers will allow new mothers to take perhaps a few unpaid days or weeks off work to care for their child, many do not. Consequently, many new moms are either forced to leave their children at home with a babysitter while they work- an increasingly expensive proposition- or take their infants to work with them, where they put immense stress on their mothers.\n\nAs most politicians are male, relatively few are more aware of this problem than President Margaret Chase Smith. She knows better than most that women not only deserve maternity leave, but require it. Raising a new generation is neither easy nor cheap, and thus, the President will press state legislatures to pass laws that mandate maternity leave, preferably of the paid variety."

This state of affairs cannot continue, for the sake of all those Americans forced to work long hours in poor conditions for the bare-minimum in wages, and President Smith acknowledges such.\n\nUnder the President's new economic reforms, the ability to unionize will no longer be a privilege for American workers, but an inextricable right. Previously, unionization was only protected at the state-level, with virtually no federal regulation in the matter. In her new legislation, the National Labor Relations Board would be given the authority to protect American workers' unions across state lines, greatly increasing the strength of the employees against their potentially unfair employers."

At the time being, the best we can do is grant economic security to the most low-income of people in American society; the blind, disabled, and those who have to provide for others, like single mothers.\n\nIn her most recent bill in a long but unfinished list, President Smith and her Congressional allies have worked together to create the American Economic Security Act, which will guarantee financial aid for those who either cannot work or cannot support their families, namely the disabled and low-income families.

In order to rectify the issue, the President and her allies in Congress have drafted a new bill to create a new federal program to assist the elderly: Americare.\n\nIn this new healthcare program, all Americans over the age of 65 years of age, or those suffering from serious, lifelong conditions, would become subject to government-provided health insurance. Americare would not discriminate along racial or monetary grounds either, with full coverage regardless of race, gender, income, or other factors.

To ensure the health of our working mothers, as well as the future generation of Americans they are raising, President Margaret Chase Smith has proposed greatly lessening the financial strain that children place upon their parents.

While many government laws over the past hundred years have tried to increase safety in the American workplace, these have been few and far between.\n\nHowever, due to extensive, somewhat-bipartisan campaigning and President Smith's cooperation with the C-NPP, this standard may be ready to change. The President and her allies in Congress have penned the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, for short. It would provide for the establishment of a new federal agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which will cooperate with workers unions and health experts to determine which workplace practices are safe, and which are not.

This option is not without its downsides, however; these insurance companies are still businesses, and thus are primarily for-profit, so there will still be a not-insignificant price-tag.\n\nIn a state-provided system, supported mainly by the C-NPP and progressive elements of Congress, the government itself would be the primary care provider, with tax income serving as the payment method. This system would almost completely eliminate the cost of medical care for the patient. However, it would also cost significantly more, and lead to a massive increase in federal spending.

While there are many small differences in where the funding would be allocated, the crux of the scandal relates to $400 million that was promised to both the VA and expansion of overseas bases. We do not have the spare funds to satisfy both sides, and now both Jackson and Buckley are outraged, leaving the Surge Act likely dead on arrival.

If we really want to keep the party united, we should remind them of the greatest threat of all.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine dictates we protect our interests in the Western Hemisphere. The Smith Doctrine dictates a tough stance on the Sphere, to prevent a repeat of our failure in the Pacific War. The Charter of the Organization of Free Nations dictates we must protect democracy wherever it exists. The weakness of the NPP dictates we must take advantage of all of these precedents.

If we're proceeding with an anti-Japanese message to unite the party, we need to further radicalize the base against them.

His followers include segregationists so vile that even George Wallace might have second thoughts, militiamen preparing for a Japanese invasion, and even self-proclaimed American Nazis.\n\nThis does not mean that Yockey cannot be useful. The undue influence the Empire of Japan holds over the United States is a favorite subject of both the president and Mr. Yockey these days, and while his rhetoric is more... unrestrained, if convinced to follow the president's current expectations, he could be quite useful."

# Chase Smith Events
chase.open.1.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
chase.open.1.desc:0 "At the crack of dawn following the Inauguration, President Smith was already pouring herself a second cup of coffee while grimacing at the magnitude of the work ahead. \n\n Though the press raved about how Smith, the 'Grand Dame' of the NPP, had transformed the bickering party into a united front against the R-Ds, few knew how fragile the party was.  The party had nearly consumed itself after 1964, with the progressive and labor-friendly Center group, now led by the avowed socialist Michael Harrington, clashing incessantly with George Wallace's Far Right bloc, espousing 'states' rights' and free business.  The two only begrudgingly agreed on actively resisting Japan, which the R-Ds paid plenty of lip service to anyway.\n\nAs party divisions escalated openly going into the midterms, Smith - whose tenure in Washington, orthodox economics, and Maine liberalism could open doors across the party - had sat the two factions down.  She'd flatly warned that their squabbles were hemorrhaging support for the NPP, unless they put their differences aside behind a novel candidate - Smith herself.  Wallace and Harrington had grudgingly agreed, if only because the alternative was the political wilderness.\n\nBut now that Smith had won the White House, in defiance of political gravity in the NPP, reality would soon come crashing back down.  And although Smith has her own ambitions - in labor, healthcare, women's rights, and the fight against Japan - none of them would matter if the NPP went up in smoke."

As the last of the circle of five filed into the Oval Office on a sleepy Saturday morning, smiling over their new access to the center of American political power, President Smith decided to impress upon them the gravity of the challenge they faced. \n\n "Gentlemen, do any of you recall the tragedy of the antebellum Whig Party?" Smith opened, noticeably tapping a stack of history books she'd conveniently placed on the desk.  The expressions of everyone else in the room tightened instantly.  Smith smiled; of course everybody knew the story of how one of the major political parties of the pre-Civil War era had imploded, fracturing under the weight of its own contradictions concerning the great question of its day - slavery. \n\n "I'm not saying that the NPP is going the way of the Whigs, but with Wallace on our right and Harrigton to the left, we're not too far from that scenario either."  Smith paused, letting the room absorb the magnitude of the task at hand.  "The papers are saying that having a woman in the Oval Office is history in its own right.  But any President is judged by the legacy they leave behind, and I refuse to have this administration be a footnote to the divisions in our own party!" "

We had hoped, that in the process of bargaining a historic compromise between the socialist left and the traditionalist right, that President Smith could deliver a fair and respectful deal for our readers and America.'\n\n'But our hopes appear unanswered by the President's own words yesterday in Congress.  Flanked only by the deputies of the NPP's center and leftist caucus, the President had the audacity to declare, presumably without consulting her colleagues to the right, that the government would make "the addressing of economic inequality and the cause of civil justice" a priority.'\n\n'By all means, we welcome measures aimed at addressing the plight of the rural poor and disadvantaged.  Our readers know many in need of such help.  But we must ask, in the name of good and decent government, whether government funds will be productively used; that is, whether we are teaching a man to fish, or simply handing them a fish.  We must be honest with ourselves; though many will claim they are in need, how many are truly deserving, and how many are simply in want?'\n\n- Editorial, p.4, The Savannah Register"

But now here they were, two creatures of differing political camps in need of each other. \n\n Smith opened the meeting.  "Mr. Harrington, you know as well as I do that the NPP is being pulled apart between the Center and the Far Right.  And if we're going to get anything done in the next four years, I need at least one of the two to support legislation in Congress."\n\n"Believe me, the Center is more than happy to help, just as we have on civil rights in the past." Harrington replied brightly, before pausing. \n\n"I assume there's a 'but' coming?" Smith said. \n\nHarrington nodded.  "My colleagues and I joined the NPP to have a shot at reforms for the working class - real reforms, not just the kind of band-aid fixes proposed by the R-Ds and opposed by the Far Right.  And now here we are, with the Presidency in your hands." \n\n Harrington leaned forward.  "The question isn't whether you need MY support.  Do I have YOUR support, Madame President?""

Have you abandoned your moral certitude, so often praised during your presidential campaign, in the pursuit of power?  Are your ethics, most famously arrayed against the persecutions of McCarthy, now inconvenient?

Give the Southern states some freedom to breathe, and we'll give you our votes."\n\nSmith slowly finished her coffee, letting the dregs settle.

The Army is at the center of attention in Washington today, and tonight we are honored to welcome General Omar N. Bradley, former President Eisenhower's right-hand man during the Battle for Britain. Thank you for your time, General.\n\n...\n\nINTERVIEWER: So do you feel that General Westmoreland was within his rights to resign? \n\nGEN. BRADLEY: He was, though the Army lost a good man as a result. If your disagreement with the Commander in Chief is so profound that it impedes your duties, you resign. But - and can I say something? - what does bother me about all this, is that falsehoods are being propagated for political purposes, to discredit and undercut the authority of the Commander in Chief. Take the entire business about pension cuts. I called the Pentagon yesterday and, from what I can tell, there is no such plan. It is a lie.

Although it had taken the assembled bureaucracies of Washington a week at full tilt (and not inconsiderate levels of overtime) to gather the data necessary, the Smith Administration finally let loose with a barrage of facts across print and broadcast media. Treasury Secretary Long led the effort, sitting opposite Walter Cronkite on the nightly news: \n\n"I won't dispute that in our country, we can have honest disagreements on policy, without compromising civilian control," Long reassured Cronkite, in his matter-of-fact, self-assured tone. "But - and as a journalist, I'm sure you agree - any debate must ultimately be based upon facts. Using lies to push a certain conclusion, or to create a false impression, debases a civil society that stands apart from the everyday brutality of Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan." \n\nWith little to say in the face of the numbers and an increasingly skeptical mainstream media, unsourced headlines warning of a military pension crisis largely disappeared in the days following the Cronkite interview. \n\nUnfortunately, Long's open criticism of the Army's enablers as 'un-American' had gone over rather poorly at the Pentagon. Several days after the interview, Defense Secretary Stennis' weekly briefing with the Joint Chiefs was delayed by nearly three hours, after the Army Chief of Staff found unspecified 'urgent and pressing' business to attend to, before sending their deputy to attend."

The lack of authoritative, official comment from the Administration - even to contradict its own legislators - looked less like the 'principled refusal to comment on falsehoods' and increasingly like incompetence. \n\nThe human mind tries to see patterns, even where none exists. It was therefore easy for many Americans - and certainly the Army soldiers and veterans at the heart of the storm - to interpret the Administration's silence and the NPP's floundering as a signal of malign intent. After all, if they didn't plan to reduce military pensions, why weren't they saying anything?"

Dipping into the pensions of our soldiers to pay for industry kickbacks and inflated cost-plus acquisitions programs. How can the American taxpayer stand being robbed to pay the military-industrial complex?" \n\nThe NPP had spent years attacking the corruption and the incestuous nature of the R-D establishment; the R-D's, Republicans and Democrats alike, were no doubt enjoying the opportunity to give the NPP a taste of its own medicine.

A silent groan could be felt - yet another leak? And this time, not in the papers, but in the heart of the committee? \n\nTheir R-D colleague did not lack for ammunition, spending the next twenty minutes monologuing at length about the alleged failures of NPP procurement. Faulty aircraft carrier catapults, untested missile guidance systems, bomber aircraft testing well short of their performance targets, among others. It was a comprehensive, all-inclusive litany of the shortfalls of the various programs the Smith Administration had (or was planning) to advance. \n\nPerhaps too comprehensive? The ranking NPP member furrowed his brow. It was certainly convenient that all of these glaring failures were coming to light now, timed to embarrass President Smith. If these were Army weapons, then yes, he could understand this kind of ambush. But would the Navy and Air Force do the same? \n\nThe ranking NPP member stared at his opposite number.

Repeated instances of less qualified - or unqualified - candidates to senior billets, despite the presence of suitable alternatives. A culture of harassment morphing into toxic enmity in the ranks. These were the stories of African-American servicemen being resegregated in the Navy, recounted in searing detail in TIME magazine. \n\nPresident Smith laughed hollowly as she pored over the details in a deserted White House study. Damningly, these details had been corroborated by the Navy Inspector General, whose initial findings warned grimly that this was only the tip of the iceberg. Appended to the report were directives from Secretary of Defense John Stennis, tying him unmistakably to the chaos developing in the Navy. \n\nSmith sunk deeper into her thoughts, as protestors gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue. With this revelation, her struggle with the Army had exploded into the American public consciousness. The congressional hearings would enter high gear, with the R-Ds smelling blood in the water as the NPP fell into disarray yet again. \n\nSmith allowed herself a rare scowl. Stennis. That man - from his clumsy handling of the Army and now this - was nothing but trouble.

Congressional staffers, legal analysts, defense policymakers, and (what appeared to be) the entire Washington press corps took all of the sitting space in the room; photojournalists had to settle for sitting on the carpet, contorting their bodies in increasingly inventive ways to brace their cameras for the perfect shot. \n\nIn between her meetings, President Smith stole glances at the television, carrying a live feed of the Washington theater that was captivating the nation, from the testimony of African-American officers drummed out of the service to sailors involved in instances of racial brawls on bases - and in one instance, on an aircraft carrier's mess hall. The stories of failing discipline and discord within the services, and the NPP's role in causing it, were now painfully public. As the committee broke for lunch, President Smith had little difficulty imagining the rancor behind closed doors at the NPP, tearing itself apart over civil rights once again. After several long minutes, she made a call to Capitol Hill. \n\nAs the committee reconvened, the R-Ds opened with a single, piercing question: "Will the Administration rescind these unconstitutional policies that have so terribly impacted our servicemen?""

The teams take to the field as a dark cloud has over the stands. The whistle blows, and the lines crash, harder and with a sharper crack than in years past. \n\nSlam! An Army linebacker breaks through and barrels into the Navy quarterback at top speed, throwing both to the ground. The Army cadets roar as the play stops, only to be matched by the Navy midshipmen as their quarterback lies motionless. Half of the Navy team marches to the Army huddle, who close ranks to defend their own. The two sides jostle, and the stands vibrate with a crackling animosity. \n\nAmidst the tangle, an Army linesman's helmet jerks backward from an errant fist. He slams into a Navy receiver, who tumbles violently into an Army cornerback. Pandemonium reigns as the teams descend into a brawl, teammates rushing from the sidelines as the energy of the stands explodes into a frenzy. \n\nAfterwards, a Pentagon spokesperson sheepishly attributes the incident, and its numerous injuries, to 'excessive exuberance.' The press is far less circumspect, comparing the football brawl to the recent mudslinging on Capitol Hill, lamenting the sorry state of a government too consumed by infighting to lead the nation."

These hopes were now dashed, as Chief of Staff Bryce Harlow's investigation into the leaks tormenting her Administration had identified Brigadier General Alexander Haig as the link between the Army and the press, distributing the key memos linking John Stennis to the Navy's segregation debacle. \n\nResigning in protest, and then loudly complaining about it, was a time-honored tradition, and President Smith had resigned herself to dealing with the fallout of Stennis' mismanagement of the Army. But this level of trickery? It was behavior she'd come to expect from the R-Ds - but not from an Army looking to do an end-run around their President. \n\nHer hands shook gently as she took her reading glasses off, chewing on the arms in a quiet fury. If the Army wanted to play with fire, then they could burn: she could publicly axe General Haig, making an example of him to the cheers of the NPP. At the same time, she could imagine the fury that would inspire in the remaining Army staff, even if they got the message. Would satisfying her fury be worth it?"

The response of your administration to these attacks has been admirable in its defense of the principles of our military, and I confess I struggle to think of what I could do better in your position. \n\nTo business: my inquiries with the Office of the Inspector General have revealed the existence of one 'Army Study Group OP-23.'

All's fair in love and war on Capitol Hill. But I have to say, all your secretive meetings and phone calls with the Pentagon?

The Army officials at the hearing noticeably bristled in their seats. Some looked to the R-D's on the committee to offer them some cover. \n\nNone did.

An Army staffer was presenting before the President, her Cabinet, and the senior officers of each service about the progress on the shift of resources from the Army to the other services. \n\nAnd yet, she could feel the suspicion and resentment brewing among the attendees. Oh, Smith had been able to have her way with defense policy in the end; Congress' tepid acknowledgment of the Army attempt to upend her Administration had been more than enough for her to summarily dismiss the senior leadership of the Army. But the Army, now lacking for leaders and never having been conclusively proven wrong, was hardly in a mood to cooperate. \n\nThe staffer wrapped up his presentation, turning to return to their seat on the Army's side of the conference table. A narrowing of the eyes - a sullen glare? - at the President, matched by the rising hackles of Navy admirals and Air Force generals sitting opposite their Army counterparts. Despite everyone in the same room being on the same side, the room was frigid, the opposing services facing off against each other at the heart of America's government. \n\nPresident Smith watched the two sides of her nation's armed services square off against each other, a cold war within the Cold War, and found herself wondering: who could she trust to follow her orders?"

"The R-D's have been calling expert witnesses, raising points of order, introducing amendments, the works. It's not gone anywhere." \n\nSecretary of State Kirkpatrick pointed at the stack of folders with her pen. "None of those have made any progress either. Missile development, bomber modernization, nuclear propulsion. All blocked because of that damned National Security Strategy." \n\n"And we all know who wrote that garbage." Smith sighed wearily, resisting the urge to bury her face in her hands. The R-D's in Congress had been bragging about their 'National Security Strategy' for weeks now, which - conveniently - mirrored the Army's talking points during the recently-ended Congressional hearings. \n\nNobody would say it out loud, but it was now excruciatingly clear that the Army was calling the shots, and their R-D buddies were all too happy to help them. All the while, the stack of stalled bills on President Smith's desk grew higher and higher, a reminder of abandoned dreams and of ignominious failure."

Our enemies, safe in a subjugated Europe and Asia, chip away at the remaining free states in South America and Oceania. If Britain and South Africa taught America anything, it is that the last defense of freedom will always be the soldier defending their home." \n\n"Anonymous, my ass," Secretary of State Kirkpatrick grumbled. \n\nPresident Smith nodded somberly. Beyond its rhetorical flourishes, the article went into intimate detail about the Administration's force planning, and the Navy and Air Force's domineering role in doctrinal planning, details that only insiders would have known. It was all patently obvious, a final present from their leaker in the Pentagon. It was the Army's last word, an alternate concept of military force that the R-Ds could seize upon, to say nothing of the embarrassment of the NPP being unable to stop the leak. \n\nTreasury Secretary Long shifted uncomfortably in his seat.

Put bluntly, was the fundamental proposition of prioritizing the Navy and the Air Force to fight wars abroad, a winnable one? What then became of the allocated funding, the subsidies to manufacturers, the new doctrines? Were they not useless? \n\nIt was the murmur of NPP legislators during committee recess, finding themselves spent and bereft of counterarguments against the R-D onslaught. They had manned the walls for so long they had nothing against the sappers coming from underneath them, the fear that all their efforts were indeed for naught. \n\nIt was the dawning realization among the watching gallery that, for the first time since the entire affair had begun, the NPP was struggling to answer questions, huddling among themselves before calling for yet another recess. \n\nThe committee's business began to accelerate toward its conclusion, and the White House would only have days to respond."

With the upper ranks of the Army depleted, all eyes were on the individuals tasked with leading the new Army, and the Administration was taking particular care to keep any troublesome associates of the Revolt's ringleaders out of the halls of power. \n\nThe downside, of course, was that the replenishment of the Army's leadership was proceeding at a slower pace than expected, keeping the Army from operating at peak efficiency. \n\nPresident Smith finished reviewing the list, handing the clipboard back to Harlow.

She meant it; every one of the individuals present had pulled their weight through the entire affair, juggling their responsibilities while jumping the hurdles set before them by Congress. \n\n"When you say jump, we say how high. That's how it works, ma'am." The admiral excused himself, while President Smith surveyed the Oval Office and its occupants. \n\nVice-President Agnew. Her Cabinet, Kirkpatrick, Long, and Stennis. The admirals and the generals, the junior staffers and the experienced undersecretaries. Individually, herself included, they could merely manage America; but when they came together, they would truly lead America.\n\nAnd then there was the Army.

The reactions varied. The R-Ds were full of backhanded praise, thankful that the Administration was willing to learn from its mistakes. The NPP offered veiled insults, noting their disagreement while allowing that the Administration might be more 'flexible' than them. \n\nIn the evening, a column of Navy admirals and Air Force generals filed into the Oval Office. Tempers flared. Raised voices pierced through the walls, including the voice of President Smith. As the officers left, most could be seen without their starred shoulder boards, having left them on the President's desk. \n\nAnd when most of the next morning's papers carried the headline 'The Submission of the Admirals', most Americans scratched their heads in puzzlement, wondering if their government had any idea what it was doing."

The Japanese have paid greatly in blood in uprooting the foreigner from the land they exploit, and this effort will not be in vain. To have American naval presence in the South China Sea would be considered an insult to all those who gave their lives to the liberation of Asia, the countless tombs in the depths of the Pacific would be disgraced as soon as the approval is given.

After preparing herself for her duties, she walked the halls of the White House, finally settling down in the Oval Office desk, sifting through a few documents she prepared for herself the night before. \n\n"Good morning, Madam President." said her Chief of Staff, followed by her National Security Advisor, General Maxwell Taylor.. "Ma'am, there's a situation in the Pacific." \n\nThe President sat, her face scrunching at the horrific contents contained within the folder. A plane gone down in the Pacific, entering Japanese airspace over the South China Sea. An American plane. Stennis's plane. President Smith remained stern as she thought about the coercions committed by the Japanese Empire for nearly two decades, and now it had possibly cost her the life of Secretary of Defense John Stennis, a man she did not always agree with, but had considered an ally in her Presidency. \n\nThe thoughts of Americans, terrified, in a burning and crashing airliner into a cold, unforgiving sea plagued Smith's mind. "What shall we do, ma'am?" Asked her Chief of Staff."

The President kept her hands clasped her hands atop the table, many of her aides looked through their notes, and many more aimlessly paced around the room. Feet tapped, coughs echoed, and anxiety ran through the air. After a seemingly endless wait, President Smith, amongst her cabinet members save for one empty seat, received the incoming transmission from Japanese authorities: \n\n"The aircraft unlawfully entered the South China Sea airspace, and was promptly responded to as the threat it had been perceived to be. Furthermore, no signs of the wreckage have been found, and attempts at communication have failed." \n\nThe President's head lowered to meet her hands, concluding that the Secretary of Defense must have been killed during the initial explosion, or perhaps the crash following afterwards. "The Japanese Empire has spilt American blood into Pacific seas. We, as a nation, and as a cabinet who has lost a member, cannot allow the Japanese to continue such barbarism any longer. General Taylor, I have chosen to appoint you to assume command as Secretary of Defense, and we shall make it a priority that you are sworn in by the Senate. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, you shall approach the Japanese and discuss our heartfelt anger as a nation, and our grievances with their handling of the situation, publicly. Japan's apologies will be the first step in mending the situation. Everyone else, go, prepare yourselves for what may come next." \n\nThe administration broke off to their offices to brace for what was to come."

Though she filled her time with preparations and communications, she knew that either the Japanese were going to comply, or the United States was going to finally get to play it hard against the Empire that embarrassed her all those years ago. The President had memories going through her head, of all the anger and hate felt by Americans like her after Pearl Harbor, after the Accords, after everything. Finally, the Secretary of State stepped through the door, interrupting the President's thoughts with an equally scornful look. \n\n"The Japanese, they decided to declare that the aircraft they shot down was assigned to an espionage mission." Kirkpatrick said, while the President's eyes widened, and her mouth opened in shock. "The Prime Minister stated that no apology will be given out to the government who illegally entered Japanese airspace in order to monitor their actions and restrict their autonomy within their own territory." Secretary Kirkpatrick continued. "God damnit!" exclaimed the President, as she brought her hand to rub her forehead. \n\n "You know, we always have the other option." Kirkpatrick said, grimly. "You expect me to want to bow down to the Japanese after they just killed my cabinet member? Absolutely not, we're pushing this forward, we need to get the Navy to the South China Sea to search." \n\n"Ma'am, with all due respect, this could potentially lead to more American lives being lost then there has to be, it's not good to potentially lose personnel, especially if this calms down anyway."

You may have gotten donations from me this past campaign, but if this keeps up, don't expect any for reelection." "Now listen here, Thompson, if you believe that you made a mistake, then go, but you wanted me elected to deal with the Japanese, and I'm dealing with them." \n\nThe phone clicked. \n\nJust a few minutes later, Smith answered the Office phone with a quick "Hello?" after she recovered a bit from the last conversation. "Hello ma'am, it's Kirkpatrick. The Japanese have responded to our demands. They're holding out, the government has stated an official barring of any United States military vessels from entering the South China Sea, and any ignoring of the mandate will be met with resistance from the Imperial Japanese Navy." Silence rung out afterwards, as the final flash of astonishment for the President only left her with bitterness. \n\n"Madam President, I do not believe even Stennis would want the United States going to a war over them. We could try to gamble, but I do not think it will work this time, personally." "I understand, Jeane, just let me ask around and we'll go from there." Smith responded, before hanging up the phone and punching in the Secretary of the Navy's office.

Those bastards actually sent out their ships, do they really have the gall to block us from retrieving our citizens' bodies from the open ocean? It was a navigational error for a diplomatic mission, not like we were dropping the bomb over Tokyo! The President's head swirled, not with the worry that plagued Americans at this point, but rather anger. One of the reasons for her nomination and election was her desire to fight back against Japanese persecution, and to hell if she won't stand by it. \n\nBut Kirkpatrick's words continued to float around her mind. Would Stennis have wanted this? To possibly embroil America into another war over some bodies, even his own? She may not have liked everything he had to say, but she agreed that he was as valid as anyone else to stand as an American, would it not serve him well to honor his wishes post mortem? \n\nHowever, the Japanese weren't going to wait for a decision from the United States to respond soon enough.

How shall we proceed, Madam?" \n\nAt the end of Chafee's report, the White House immediately rang the alarm. Tension had gone from denunciations and demands to the possibility of a Pacific War within a few short days. West Wing personnel gathered their belongings and prepared their defenses, preparing for a possible evacuation of the President and her Cabinet if need be. People were scared, terrified even, afraid that this would be their last day on this Earth. \n\nBut the President was bitter. She was angry, enraged that the Prime Minister and his ministry dared to sink to such levels over retrieving bodies from an accident, an accident that they damn well caused. She knew that it was their fault, the Imperial Army shot down innocent government workers who were on a diplomatic mission, and now could not bear the possibility of embarrassment. Even if it meant a war-torn Pacific. However, she could not help but know that her fellow Americans were scared. Her mind turned back to the history of the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, how, at the time, Vice President Kennedy managed to alleviate the fears of each and every American, even the ones standing beside her in the Congress, as each filled with terror at the thought of their death, yet Smith remembered her own anger and wish for revenge at that moment.

She remembered the beauty of Australia, they were a strong ally in the face of Japanese influence in the Pacific. Now, the Japanese have laid waste to the capital of their ally. \n\n"Madam President, the Fleet Admiral reports that the Seventh is making headway in beating back the Japanese fleet, but there's fears of reinforcements, should we continue the attack or wait to regroup with support?" Chafee spoke. Smith remembered her courage, wanting to fight back against the terror that the Japanese enforced against her beautiful country so long ago. Now, she has finally gotten what she wanted, as the Navy pounds against the Japanese Fleet in the South China Sea, where Secretary Stennis's body floats somewhere in the midst of a wrecked American aircraft. \n\nBut the President realized one thing: She did not feel any glory in it.

Finally, Smith can claim that with her Presidency, she was destined to reclaim America's time in the sun, a time of glory, of victory, of success. \n\nBut, would it be that way? As the hours continued, she heard horrific reports of the aerial battles over Australia, as increasing amounts of American aircraft are shot out of the sky, until they reach their graves below, coated in fuel, fire, and blood. Land forces were ordered to mobilize and prepare for a full on invasion plan of the Pacific Islands, as various leading generals yelled at one another over competing battle plans and how to finally bring down the Japanese Empire, in their minds. On top of it all, the Seventh fleet reported that they're prepared to regroup, but the Japanese look to be preparing a counterattack, one which could decimate the fleet if they do not get the reinforcements they need out there. The Pacific was on fire, and the inferno was only spreading, as the Final Pacific War had begun! The United States refused to back down after its citizens deaths, for their pride, their honor, for Stennis! \n\nHowever, past all of the reports, drawings of battle plans, organizations of armies, and commands issued to navies, one thought dominated President Margaret Chase Smith's mind. \n\nHow launch codes for the nuclear arsenal of the United States was easily accessible in a briefcase near her, and her late husband's portrait she woke up to just days ago."

"Mrs. President, the Prime Minister of Japan has decided to respectfully comply and meet with our demands. He is in the process of putting together a speech to recognize the Imperial Japanese Army's accidental shooting down of Mr. Stennis's aircraft, and is allowing complete access of the United States Navy to attempt to search for the wreckage, in order to 'alleviate tensions.'

Having said that, she knows that Kirkpatrick was not entirely wrong either, Jeane was a smart person, maybe they just got out of step earlier? \n\nThe ringing of her office phone immediately snapped her attention from her thoughts. "Harlow, what have you got?" The President asked. "Madam President, we have a development from Tokyo. It appears that the Prime Minister has signaled that they do not wish to press the issue forward any longer, and 'seeing that tensions are high with the President' as he put it, has decided to grant access to the American Navy into the South China Sea to search for the wreckage, and hopefully recover Secretary of Defense Stennis. How should we proceed?" \n\nA slow smile crept across the President's face.

If she backed down now, how could she ever say she stuck to her ideas? Finally, there was a knock at the door, General Maxwell Taylor, the soon-to-be Secretary of Defense, stood in the President's door. \n\n"Ma'am, there's been some progress.

The newspapers, the TV news, just listening to the staff in the White House, everyone was talking about the imminent dissolution and political irrelevance of the National Progressive Party. Her goals, her efforts to unite the party was crumbling. Her efforts to make the NPP more than just the unending opposition to the Republican-Democrats, to turn it into an actual option for the American people, was falling apart.\n\n Agnew spread his hands as he stood in front of the desk, and took a deep breath. "I think we should make our positions clear, Madam President. You've been doing everything in your power to keep the party together, which has required making compromises that have annoyed some people. But that's how politics works. And all those on Capitol Hill know it. But they also need to know that loyalty is a two way street."\n\n Smith leaned forward in her chair. "What are you suggesting?"\n\nl "A declaration, a party message. Make it clear that you will listen and work with everyone in the party. However, when a decision has been made, it's important that we all work together to get it passed. Party unity is much, much more important than winning political points. That needs to be made crystal clear. But, at the same time, if you stand against the decision, if you break ranks, if you leave, then you are on your own. We won't help you. If you leave for the R-Ds, you are a person non grata."\n\n Chase pondered what her Vice President was suggesting.

Senators and Representatives were at each other's throats, spending more time in their speeches and press conferences attacking each other, filibustering their own parties' legislation. All this, while letting the Republican-Democrats lean back and watch the fireworks, occasionally throwing a bit more gasoline on the fire when they finally got the chance to stand up and speak at the podium. Journalists were loving every second of it. Newspapers were going wild with the stories that were coming out. Only TV networks, without film footage from a still camera shy Congress, were restrained from turning the Congress into a pay-per-view wrestling match.\n\n "What are you suggesting, Spiro?" President Smith said. She still was determined, and resolute, but she knew when she needed assistance. All her years in the House and Senate never prepared her for this. That's where the Vice President came in.\n\n Agnew was sitting on one of the couches in the center of the room, right above the carpeted Presidential Seal, legs crossed. "We just need some more time. I'll go to those Senators that are particularly vocal, encourage them, twist their arms, threaten to cut funding for their projects. Remind them that we all hate Japan. Whatever is needed, until I can get them to support our legislation. If they come around and support us, then the others should fall in line. And then, once these bills are passed, we can work on a big compromise."\n\n The President, shoulders squared against the shadows of the setting sun, turned around, and gave a nod of her head.

With the spirit of Southern Hospitality, the meetings in the homes and offices of Senator Strom Thurmond, and George Wallace's hotel room in the Willard Hotel have been the scene of many a long night of drinks, smoking, and backroom politicking.\n\n Eventually, the leaders of the FR-NPP present Agnew with something they would want in the event of a massive bill. While the majority of the FR is segregationist and would love nothing better than to roll back civil rights, that is off the table thanks to the public pressure. However, they also fought for the "little man" and those left behind, and so they wanted something else: a massive aid program for the South. Low or no interest loans for farmers, subsidies for new industries, and efforts to alleviate the impoverishment of the region that stretched back as far as the aftermath of the Civil War. And of course, every Senator, Representative and Governor will have their own pork barrel project: a big bridge across an uncrossed river, a contract to a local business, or some new courthouses and police stations.\n\n Now, any administration could propose such a program and most likely get it through Congress. However, the problem is that it would be massively expensive, and with all the other possible additions to the bill it could make the national debt balloon and make many deficit hawks start screaming to the heavens.

Money would be provided to refurbish and repair schools, provide new textbooks, train more teachers, hire nurses and qualified therapists, provide a robust school lunch system, improve school gymnasiums, playgrounds and other activities, and much more. This would mostly focus on schools in the inner cities of the Northeast and Midwest that have been suffering since the rise of "white flight" to the suburbs in the past couple of decades, which have resulted in gaps in funding and the drop of test scores and the prospects for their graduates, if they even can.\n\n Sponsoring an education bill that would give a lot of money to schools around the nation is a pretty popular idea (after all, who doesn't want to help the children?), but adding it to this law will be very expensive and add a lot of red ink to the federal budget.

Harrington said he would like to make this new body as non-partisan as possible, so he'd be willing to have members of the FR-NPP, and maybe even R-Ds, to sit on it's board.\n\nWhile the idea of supporting unions and their millions of dues-paying members is a sound political strategy, and wouldn't even be horribly expensive compared to other programs and ideas members of the NPP have proposed, it would result in more costs for companies with the higher wages and increased standards required, and some of the conservative, pro-business politicians of the NPP would be loathe to support such a measure.

Explicitly, cut the taxes on some of America's largest corporations, and perhaps a few of the very rich as well. After decades of mismanagement by a bloated federal government dumping the hard earned wealth of "job creators" and the "engines of prosperity" into a black hole of bureaucracy and thousands of niche programs, it's time to reward these guys and their companies with a bit of a kickback. With these new resources, they can invest back into the economy by expanding their business, hiring new workers, acquire new technology and all that good stuff that will, undoubtedly, make everyone much, much better off in the long run.\n\n It's hard to tell how much of what Cohn is suggesting is true, that these companies need just a few million more tax-free dollars to make their companies grow even more, or if it's really just an excuse to grant even larger paychecks to the executives or dividends to the stockholders. The gap in revenue from lower corporate taxes will have effects on other parts of the federal budget that will have to be covered with raised taxes elsewhere, or even more debt.

Even if everyone had a chance to go over all the details, and debate the bill on the floor of the Senate, voting against the bill will likely result in you voting against your own best interests, both in having popular suggestions scuttled, or in having your supporters consider you a traitor, corrupted by the Washington elite.\n\n While not everyone got what they wanted in the bill, hopefully enough people, from enough factions of the party, did so that they will vote for it. This has been a great achievement for President Margaret Chase Smith: great projects that will affect the lives of every American, and also bringing unity to the National Progressive Party."

Toss some more generous welfare benefits to appease Harrington and Jackson, some directed funding to the south to appeal to the segregationists, a few Buy American riders and regulation cutting for the businessmen. Hell, even a couple of the last radical ideas of the LNPP and Yockey's bunch are being tossed in, just to make sure there is enough votes.\n\n Of course, only a few people actually know that it's Spiro Agnew who's suggested this to the President, and not her idea alone. And even Agnew, the wily political operator that he has become in the past few months, knows that this is a risky move, as most of these measures are being slipped into the budget at the last minute, with little debate or scrutiny. If someone finds out, like an R-D seeking some political points, or a NPP congressman on the verge of defecting, this could blow the whole thing up, and party unity will be even more fractured.\n\n But it's worth a shot, right?"

"Of course." \n\nWas it a genuine smile? Larry wondered. President Smith had been no champion of the poor, like Robert Kennedy or Michael Harrington. Was she just another practiced politician, all gloss and promises and no substance? \n\n"Maybe one more thing," he ventured. "I have to make sure my people are protected. No one can lose their job over this." \n\nPresident Smith's smile slipped for an instant, before it returned. "It'll be considered, Mr. Itliong." \n\nIt wasn't a yes, but it would have to be enough. "Thank you, Madame President." \n\nLater, as President Smith watched the Secret Service escort Larry from the room, and thought through his terms. Minimum wage and job security? It would require some work, but she might be able to sell the rest of the party on those points."

They discussed the ongoing strike, current wage standards, and benefits. But as the discussion continued in greater detail, both sides found themselves growing heated.\n\n"That is completely out of the question," President Smith said tersely, "Proposing to shorten the working day and increase pensions would die on arrival in Congress." \n\nChavez surveyed the room quietly, before settled his eyes back on the President."We have an opportunity to actually make some change, if you take the chance. We can finally give the worker in America what he deserves. Not just a Delano, but for everyone."\n\nAfter the meeting ended shortly, Smith rehashed Chavez's arguments in her head, and heard them in Harrington's voice. Clearly, Chavez was a radical, and would be considered one even within the NPP. Some of his ideas were well founded, but not everyone in the NPP would agree, causing trouble down the line."

They would have to end soon, with either a deal or the nightstick. \n\nThe President could simply do what much of her party had suggested, and move to break the strike. The more Center would hate it by definition, and there was no telling how such a move would look to the press.\n\nSmith thought back to the recent meetings she had with Itliong and Chavez. The easiest solution could be agreeing to Larry's terms; agreeing to raise the minimum wage would be seen as radical by some, but was sufficiently progressive enough to placate the Center without antagonizing the right too much. A peaceful, negotiated end to the strikes would have its advantages... if all the farmers agreed to it. \n\nAnd then, there was Chavez. Going along with his plan would likely elicit a violent reaction from the Far Right; increasing pensions and reducing work hours, not just at Delano but attempting to do so nationwide, would be a showstopper for the Far Right. If Smith wanted to please Chavez and make sweeping reforms, there would be considerable fallout in Congress.\n\n President Smith thought over her options once more, tightening her resolve."

Through careful tact with her own party and Larry Itliong and Cesar Chavez, President Smith has struck a compromise with the workers! \n\nDespite her success, many in the NPP's Far Right have strongly criticized any compromise. "Corruption of the free market" is an increasingly common slogan within Congress, with more extreme members of the NPP's Far-Right abandoning the party for the Democrats.\n\nHowever, one interesting congratulations note came from the Left wing of the NPP - from Gus Hall's avowed socialists and communists, even though they wishing the reforms had gone further. \n\n But with this deal, the conclusion of the Delano Grape Strikes has shifted the demographic future of the NPP.

A life not defined by what the rich think we should have, but what we know we deserve. What every worker deserves in America." The audience nodded, shouting their approval.\n\n"President Smith made some promises, of compromise and reforms. They all sound great, but - let me ask you, can we trust the President?" The crowd responded with a resounding no. "Can we trust a President who has shown time and time again that she doesn't respect the working man?" \n\n"We will not, and cannot, compromise with a leader who tramples upon the working class at the behest of her business cronies!"

One by one, the moderate union leaders resigned, or were voted out in raucous floor votes. \n\nAs the final vote ended, Gus Hall stepped up to the stage, with a fierce light in his eyes and fury in his step. \n\n"What has Washington ever done for you?" Hall opened. "From our sweat, they build their fortunes. They talk, but do nothing but take. And when we ask for real change - the price we pay is with our blood." \n\nThe crowd roared. "Fuck 'em!

Now the administration was involved in the Delano strike on the other side of the country, whether it wanted to be or not. \n\n"What's the problem? We'll let the businesses work it out. Freeman's got bigger things to worry about, and so do I." Smith didn't even look up from the speech she was editing. \n\n"Bigger things?" Agnew asked incredulously. "The press has been talking about nothing but Delano since Butz resigned! Freeman was supposed to be working this out - what is he doing right now?" \n\n"He's meeting with the farm lobby now.

"We can kiss the Center's support goodbye." \n\n"What's done, is done." Smith said, through gritted teeth. "If nobody can negotiate with the farmers, we'll need to break the strike." \n\n"Freeman and the Center walked out on us. All we asked him to do was his job, and now the Center's saying we screwed them." Agnew stated bluntly. "We'll need to demonstrate leadership. Forceful leadership." \n\n"Jesus Christ, are you going to federalize the National Guard to break a strike? Do you want us to lose the West Coast?" Harlow rolled his eyes.

Last month, you were saying that the federal government would mediate." \n\n"Well, the strikers weren't interested in mediation," Smith said, as smoothly as she could manage. "We can't mediate if the farmers aren't willing to talk." \n\n"I heard that the farmers broke off talks because they thought Secretary Orville was too close to the companies involved." The governor's voice darkened. "A conflict of interest." \n\n"Talking with the companies is part of Secretary Orville's job. It's unfortunate that the farmers don't understand that, but it is what it is." Smith breathed in. "My administration is out of options. We don't decide in state affairs; it's your job to be the final authority on matters reserved to the states. I'd hurry, if I were you. The economy can't be left idling forever." \n\nThe governor fell silent for a second. "Since when were you all in on states' rights, Madame President?"

Schenley and DiGiorgio quickly found new laborers to cross the broken line and resume work - with token concessions, but nothing close to what Chavez and Itliong, now facing jail time, had agitated for. \n\nThe Smith Administration said nothing. The business lobby was pleased, while Wallace had even sent a rare letter of appreciation to the President - and California was taking the blame. It was time to move on. \n\nThe unions in San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle watched an unfeeling administration shrug off the feeble cries and failed tactics of the Center.

"Now just a minute, the Delano demands are confined to California, how are we supposed to -" \n\n"And given how all over the place you've been between supporting businesses and the workers in the past, I don't know how much I should buy your economics pitch, either.

The National Guard would then be deployed only in limited numbers to protect scabs and federal workers from the strikers.\n\n A potential compromise solution, presented after the meeting by Nathan Wolkimir of the National Federation of Federal Employees and backed by the friendly union leaders Alan Whitney and John Griner, aims to split the UFPC and thus leave Rademacher's NALC as clear leaders of the strike.

Madam President; last Friday a piece in the New York Times by Frank Bullard revealed the badge and ID of an FBI agent, recovered at the scene of the Midtown Riots at Manhattan last week. This in turn led to the Washington Post exposé on Monday alleging a wholesale infiltration of the protest movement, on the direction of the White House, in an attempt to provoke violence in the crowd. Do you have any comment on this or on the credibility of the White House staffer the Post claims as their source?" \n\n"I do not have a habit of commenting on wild speculation and rumormongering, but rest assured that my administration has no wish to see violence escalate in American cities. Whoever this so-called whistleblower is, I assure you he or she will soon be out of a job for spreading such malicious lies. Next question?" \n\n"Bob Karlewitz, the Enquirer. Is it true that George Meany called your office yesterday and threatened a general strike?"\n\n "I did talk to Mr. Meany on the phone yesterday, yes, but I only expressed the desire of the White House to come to an amicable solution that ensures good pay and rights for the postal workers. I have the full and unequivocal support of all sections of my party on this issue, with even our... Southern members stating that our mailmen deserve a raise for servicing in 'potentially dangerous, low-income' neighborhoods. This is a peace offering, not a surrender.""

She barely had time to rub the sleep out of her eyes and drowsily accept the call from the switchboard before the severity of the situation dawned on her. Twenty-four dead in Manhattan. Sixty-seven wounded, nineteen critically. Several dozen strikers had seized one of the mail sorting offices and knocked out or forced to surrender all the armed National Guardsmen. Over three hundred unarmed Guardsmen had been taken hostage by the mob, prompting the local commander to attempt a rescue. During the chaos, around two hundred of the hostages had rushed and overpowered their captors, seizing their weapons. This would however turn to tragedy when they exited the building, and the outside National Guard units, mistaking them in the poor light for charging armed assailants, fired into the fleeing Guardsmen and the nearby crowd alike. Eventually the governor stepped in and ordered all Guard units to leave Manhattan.\n\n Upon the conclusion of the call the President would get dressed and walk at a brisk pace down the Oval Office, ordering her phone connected to George Wallace and for all staffers to leave the room. It is not known what was said that night, but staffers would later tell a story of how the President had calmly left the office at the end of the call, leaving behind a phone that had been slammed down so hard they had to replace it."

Resulting from the economic damages of the Postal Strike and the inefficient attempts at a military replacement, eventually culminating in a night of violence that shocked both strikers and government, the bill is a compromise, albeit one that favors the strikers. Once U.S. Mail is reorganized into a semi-corporate public agency named the USPS, mail workers will receive a 12% pay raise on the condition that they will not ask for any other raises for five years, beyond ones equivalent to inflation. The strikers' unions will be allowed to form one big union, the American Postal Workers Union, with collecting bargaining and striking rights, something not allowed for other federal workers. However, they will not be allowed to strike in several states at the same time, and no more than five days a week.\n\nAt least this mess is behind us, but the President's authority and public trust is seriously compromised."

Widely seen as a capitulation by the government and negotiated in conjunction with the AFL and NACL, the bill promises postal workers a 15% raise and collective bargaining and striking rights once U.S. Mail transitions to the new US Postal Service. A new national postal union, the APWU, will form to represent the employees of the USPS. In return the AFL made the APWU agree to ten years without strikes or demands for further raises, as well as limiting such strikes to five days a week and allowing critical government services to use a small number of scabs during the strikes, in the interest of national security. In an attempt to pacify the Dixies, during the ten year period the state postal services will be allowed to self-regulate postal employment, an implicit exemption from civil rights legislation regarding racial discrimination in hiring."

chase.postal.22.desc:0 "Amazingly, the longshot plan actually worked; the Postal Reorganization Act went through the Senate today and the strikes have quieted down. The Manhattan Midtown Riots resulted in a serious loss of face for the wildcat strikers, and allowed the pro-NPP UNA-wing of the United Federation of Postal Clerks to unseat the leftist NF-wing as leaders of the largest postal union, under threat of breaking apart the UFPC. With both the largest mail carrier union in the form of NALC, and the largest postal clerk union in the form of UFPC, open for negotiations, the smaller unions have fallen in line and gradually reigned in the wildcat strikers under threat of expulsion. Because of the bad press surrounding the strikers, we have been able to push for further concessions from the unions, and they have agreed to continuing the strike ban and accept an 8% pay increase, as employees of the new US Postal Service. They will be given collective bargaining rights, albeit on our terms. To keep the pliable Rademacher in charge, the NALC will be the root of a new union, the National Association of Postal Workers, the other unions folding in under it. Should Rademacher get any ideas, we have a secret deal with the UNA-wing to crash the NAPW before it can pose a threat like the Postal strike again. Now all that remains is to bury all proof of our involvement deep to avoid the fate of Nixon."

It was hugely inefficient and we had to bribe the NALC with a 20% payraise for their mailmen to actually deliver the damn mail the Guard sorted, but it worked. The US Postal Service is being created as an independent agency, and most of the smaller unions have fallen in line as long as they still get their 4% raise and won't face any consequences for their roles in the Postal Strike. The UFPC remains defiant, but ain't strong enough to disrupt national mail services on their own without the other unions or backing from the AFL, especially not as National Emergency Proclamation 3972 grants us unlimited emergency powers to use the National Guard for filling any holes in the mail rooms. We plan on leaving this order in place in perpetuity, even if Congress doesn't like it. No damn nicks are going to undermine our economy like this again; the strikers wouldn't dare lay a hand on the National Guard again after that brass-balled corporal mowed down six of'em couple weeks back.

More than once, the meetings ended only when Harrington and Wallace were exhausted, offering concessions just to get out the room. The President and the Vice-President reviewed the day's agenda. Union security agreements and the corporate tax. A recipe for disaster. \n\nThe minutes passed. Harrington pressed his case for ensuring that unions could collect operational dues from all employees, unionized or not. Wallace listened silently, before laying out his demand for a five percent cut in the corporate tax rate, to incentivize investment. The two eyed each other - and said nothing, an implied quid pro quo that stunned Smith and Agnew into silence. \n\nAfter the meeting ended on schedule, Agnew raised his eyebrow.

An offhand comment, a scowl, even their pace and stride; there were no details too minor to escape the notice of the press pool on the hunt. \n\nAnd yet, today, there would be nothing. The NPP contingent departed the room together, led by a Center man, who brushed away the notebooks thrust towards him, followed by a man of the Far Right, who just shook his head as he walked past.

More often than not, a good day for the phlegmatic Vice President foretold a litany of headaches in hers. She eyed the newspaper roll tucked into the sauntering man's arm crook.\n\n"Madam President," he said, proffering today's issue of The Washington Post. Margaret swiped it off his hands and unfurled its pages; half a second later, the newspaper flew an arc onto a switched-on paper shredder atop the Resolute Desk. With barely-repressed glee, the President watched the contraption tear Strom Thurmond's raisin-wrinkled mug, and the bold-faced words "'PINKO-LOVING TURNCOAT': SEN. THURMOND BLASTS MCS IN SESSION", into ribbons of day-old paper.\n\nShe turned her withering glare to Agnew, who shrugged as he dusted bits of Thurmond and libel off his lapels.

A pop and fizzle later, and the bottle was open. Agnew poured just enough to fill exactly three-fourths of either glass with its sparkling amber liquid. He gingerly lifted one flute, nodding at the President. "I suppose here's when you deliver a heartfelt speech to our recent successes?"\n\nSmith rolled her eyes. "I'd have booked a reservation in the Old Ebbitt if I had more than a toast in mind for tonight." She clinked her glass against the Vice President's. "To an economy in the up and up, and a party more united than it's ever been."\n\nAgnew's lips quirked upwards into a ghostly smile. "Then congratulations are in order, Madam President. To sound health and good government.""

#JEANE Kirkpatrick

USA.1704.d:0 ""
USA.1704.a:0 ""

POLITICS_KIRK_DESC:0 "Many less liberal-minded politicians once presumed a woman to be too soft to hold the office of President-- too weakened by feminine tenderness. Now, the fools and doubters line up out of respect and fear to Jeane Duane Kirkpatrick: a woman with a heart of steel a mind for politics. One of the founding members of the modern Far Right Wing, Kirkpatrick was rocketed to the political spotlight as the Oil Crisis grew in intensity. With her mastery of geopolitics and unbreakable resolve, the Presidency was relatively easy to win. Now, as President, she advocates what is being called the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine": a geopolitical precept that America should support friendly dictatorships in order to prevent the spread of Nazi totalitarianism. While this concept has drawn ire from many, few doubt its effectiveness in achieving its goal.\n\nOriginally from Oklahoma, Kirkpatrick studied at Columbia University while a member of the "Young People's Socialist League", the youth wing of the Socialist Party of America. While continuing to study political science at Columbia, she became less and less enthralled with socialist maxims, eventually deciding that socialism required a fundamental change in human nature to succeed. Over many years, her conservative values grew while others withered, until all that remained was cold, hard, pragmatism. After completing her PhD in 1968, Kirkpatrick became an extremely outspoken member of the Far Right, with her focus on foreign policy playing a major role in the rebranding of the group since the end of the Civil Rights debate.\n\nNow, the practical, calculating woman of iron sits in the Oval Office, slowly hammering a soft nation into a creature as unyielding as she is. The Central Intelligence Agency has seen a massive increase in funding, and the amount of third world, pro-American dictatorships is steadily rising. The chaotic winds of the world, whether through words or through swords, shall be rent into an order that respects and fears the United States of America."
