 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_POKRYSHKIN_DESC:0 "제2차 세계대전의 전설적인 에이스 조종사이자 소련의 영웅인 알렉산더 이바노비치 포크리슈킨은 전쟁이 끝난 후 그의 고향인 노보시비르스크로 돌아갔습니다. 비교적 평화로운 삶을 살길 바랬던 그는 운명이 그를 어디로 이끄는지 알지 못했습니다.\n\n포크리슈킨은 중앙 시베리아 공화국의 통치에 만족했고, 결국 공화국 정부에 들어갔습니다. 공화국 하의 노보시비르스크 시를 관리하는 일은 시베리아 전쟁 전까지만 해도 비교적 간단한 일이었습니다. 하지만, 야고다가 이끄는 강력한 동쪽의 최고 소비에트를 상대하기 위해 그는 도시 전역을 전시체제로 탈바꿈시켜야 했습니다. 배급제가 도입되었고, 시의 수많은 젊은이들이 징병되어 시베리아 전장의 총알받이로 보내졌습니다. 어느 순간, 그는 한계에 도달했고, 바르나울 시장 바실리 슈크신과 접촉한 후 그는 계획을 실행에 옮겼습니다.\n\n 두 사람과 부하들은 노보시비르스크를 신속히 점령하여, 어느 외부 영향도 받지 않고, 러시아의 혼란상 속에서 홀로 서있는 진정으로 독립적인 정부를 설립했습니다. 이제 그는 바르나울과의 불안한 동맹을 통해 시를 통치하고 있고, 그의 도시를 안정화시킬 필요가 있어 보입니다. 많은 인구를 보유한 노보시비르스크는 산업과 기능적 농업의 중심지이지만, 여전히 내적, 외적 측면에서 직면해야 할 문제들이 있으며, 이를 해결하는 것은 포크리슈킨에게 달려 있습니다."

 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1929 in Altai Krai, Vasily Makarovich Shukshin was an aspiring author prior to his dabbling in politics and his election as mayor of Barnaul. Shukshin has trekked a long road so far, one which seems endless: a prior ally of Pokryshkin when the Federation had just seceded from the Central Siberian Republic, Vasily quickly came to head with his former ally and his corporate associates, their creeping corruption clashing with Shukshin's ideals of democracy and federalism, ideals keeping his head afloat as he arranged backroom deals and negotiations necessary for his candidacy as president of the Federation to stand a chance.\n\nNow newly elected and having wrestled control away of the country from the Siloviks, Vasily isn't in a position to sit back and relax: though the Siloviks aren't in control anymore, the president has to deal with the still very present corporations and the damages their corruption has caused and is still causing to the Republic.\n\nIf he wants to see this budding democracy bloom in the desert that is Russia, he will have to face troubles caused undoubtedly by corporations during his tenure as president."
 
 ### Leader Traits ###
 the_siberian_falcon:0 "The Siberian Falcon"
 
 ### Ideas ###
 PAV_Disproportionate_Population:0 "Disproportionate Population"
 PAV_Disproportionate_Population_desc:0 "Novosibirsk has always been one of the most developed and densely populated regions across the Urals, as a hub to the Far East and a crucial link on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The city was already one of the biggest in Siberia when the Great Patriotic War broke out, but the conflict itself made it grow even more.\n\nThousands fled the German occupation, or simply the chaos that unfolded in Russian lands, and they arrived in Novosibirsk, which was soon crowded with civilians. This can be both a blessing and a curse, but it is something we have to live with."
 PAV_The_All_Siberian_Army:0 "The All-Siberian Army"
 PAV_The_All_Siberian_Army_desc:0 "The army that is responsible for the protection of the region of Novosibirsk is easily one of the most powerful and prestigious in Central Siberia. When the Siberian Falcon split from the Tomsk government to save himself and his people from the horrors of war, a large fraction of the army of the Central Siberian Republic pledged their loyalty to Pokryshkin, and soon reorganized in the south.\n\nThe All-Siberian Army has managed to reform into a force capable of rivalling even the largest neighbors of our warlord state, and the experience many men have from the Great Patriotic War and the Siberian War has proven invaluable."
 PAV_Untouched_Industry:0 "Untouched Industry"
 PAV_Untouched_Industry_desc:0 "Contrarily to many other warlords elsewhere in Russia, Novosibirsk is lucky enough to have a large and intact industrial base. The swift evacuation of the USSR's manufacturing capacity over the Urals during the German invasion, combined with Novosibirsk being outside the zone of German bombers performing missions daily, have been the main causes of this fact.\n\nIf one takes the agricultural production of Barnaul into account, then it becomes clear why we are considered one of the most advanced warlord states, and may have an edge over any enemies."
 PAV_The_Great_Opioid_Epidemic:0 "The Great Opioid Epidemic"
 PAV_The_Great_Opioid_Epidemic_desc:0 "Drugs are hard to find in warlord Russia, but Novosibirsk has presented an opportunity for many to become involved in the illegal trade of substances. With a large population and a developed economy, the central government has faced an increasing number of issues with combatting the black market where such products circulate.\n\nAs the problem continues to spiral out of control, this is beginning to have a greater effect on the community, and addiction is becoming increasingly common in Novosibirsk."

 ### Investigation ###
 PAV_narodnik_investigation_category:0 "The Narodnik Investigation"
 PAV_narodnik_investigation_category_desc:0 "It appears the Narodnik, socialist agitators including anarchists and communists, have grown bolder in their attacks. These terrorists must be dealt with by force as soon as possible, as we risk an uprising in the case of war. Our security services must investigate any lead possible, disrupt their operations, and contain their threat before they can cause any massive damage. Many of their hideouts have already been located, and operations have been planned. The federation is no home to terrorist scum!\n\nInvestigation progress is §Y[?PAV_investigation_progress]§!"

 PAV_infiltrate_narodnik_cells:0 "Infiltrate Narodnik Cells"
 PAV_infiltrate_narodnik_cells_desc:0 "The socialist terrorists menacing our statelet are of unknown number, and well concealed. Our lack of information about their activities has allowed them to continually get the better of us. They are guarded enough that the only way to discover their intentions from the inside. Sending SB agents disguised as impressionable citizens to join their ranks will give us valuable intelligence and allow us to draw them into our clutches, without the Narodniks suspecting a thing."
 PAV_investigate_factories_in_novosibirsk:0 "Investigate Factories in Novosibirsk"
 PAV_investigate_factories_in_novosibirsk_desc:0 "Novosibirsk's working classes are generally discontented about their conditions and thus easy targets for the terrorists' recruiters, who preach the virtues of wealth redistribution. As a result, rumors have spread that the Narodniks have already infiltrated the city's many factories, spreading their propaganda on the shop floor and inducting workers into their ranks. We cannot allow the engines of our economic progress to become our greatest security threat."
 PAV_increase_patrols_in_altay:0 "Increase Patrols in Altay"
 PAV_increase_patrols_in_altay_desc:0 "The Altay region is a geographer's dream, filled with tall mountains and great forests. This quality also makes it a counterinsurgency nightmare. Narodniks evading justice have taken refuge throughout the region, hiding out and even stashing weapons in the rugged terrain. Allowing the terrorists to grow roots into our territory would be a grave mistake, necessitating the allocation of more resources to security forces in the area."
 PAV_conduct_an_internal_investigation:0 "Conduct an Internal Investigation"
 PAV_conduct_an_internal_investigation_desc:0 "The Narodniks have seemingly developed a presence almost everywhere in Novosibirsk, even within their enemies' ranks. It was not long ago that socialism was Russia's prevailing ideology, after all, and there are those among the officer class that wish they were leading a Red Army instead of our own. Security organs infiltrated by the terrorist threat will naturally be ineffective at fighting it, and we need to prove that no one, not even an officer, is above the law."
 PAV_the_final_raid:0 "Launch the Final Raid"
 PAV_the_final_raid_desc:0 "Our investigations into the Narodnik movement have been numerous and thorough, and they have yielded a great deal of very valuable information. We now have good intelligence regarding the location of their main hideout, where their elusive leadership spins a web of terror and destruction throughout our territory. Decapitating the movement by targeting the masterminds in a decisive police raid will splinter it, seriously reducing the threat posed to our institutions."
 PAV_crush_the_agitators:0 "§RCrush the Agitators§!"

 ### Expansion ###
 PAV_siberian_expansion_category:0 "§GSiberian Expansion§!"
 PAV_siberian_expansion_category_desc:0 "With our domestic situation under control for the time being it is time for us to look outward. We are surrounded by threats to our sovereignty and our further control of Central Siberia. Now, we must decide where and how to strike. Whether we expand by force or by diplomacy, it will also be crucial that we prepare as best we can for the inevitable problem of integration."

 PAV_operation_homecoming:0 "§yOperation: Homecoming§!"
 PAV_operation_homecoming_desc:0 "Before us in Tomsk lies the remnants of the great beast from which our state formed, the §R[ERS.GetName]§!. While they may have meant well, their experiment became a failure long ago, and all that remains is for someone to show them just how ineffectual it has become. That someone will be us. Our forces await eagerly the order to invade, ready to tear apart the rotten institutions piece by piece, and liberate the territory still held by the salons and their loyalists."
 PAV_operation_homecoming_disband_the_salons:0 "§yDisband the Salons§!"
 PAV_operation_homecoming_disband_the_salons_desc:0 "The §YSalons of Tomsk§!, while made up of undoubtedly great intellectuals, have long since outlived their usefulness. Even now, under our occupation, they debate endlessly and pointlessly about the correct course of action, giving faint hope to those who continue to believe in the failed experiment of the Central Siberian Republic even now. The Salons must be finally disbanded before this hope becomes determination, or even rebelliousness."
 PAV_operation_homecoming_absorb_their_design_bureau:0 "§yAbsorb Their Design Bureau§!"
 PAV_operation_homecoming_absorb_their_design_bureau_desc:0 "Not all of the component parts of the government in Tomsk were useless. The Design Bureau, in particular, was a shining star in a sea of ineffectual governance, continuing to innovate even as the Republic crumbled. As we continue to integrate the lands the remnant Central Siberian Republic held, it would be wise to integrate their scientists into the teams employed by Titan, in order to bolster our own technological prowess."

 PAV_operation_kingbreaker:0 "§MOperation: Kingbreaker§!"
 PAV_operation_kingbreaker_desc:0 "The farcical neo-Rurikid regime to our west has long been a thorn in our side, and their mad king's nonsense has gone on for long enough. §MOperation: Kingbreaker§! is, as the name implies, aimed at crushing the §R[KEM.GetName]§! once and for all to bring the Kuznetsk Basin under our control."
 PAV_operation_kingbreaker_the_coal_of_kemerovo:0 "§MThe Coal of Kemerovo§!"
 PAV_operation_kingbreaker_the_coal_of_kemerovo_desc:0 "The mineral-rich §GKuznetsk Basin§! now lies under our control, and now we have to decide what to do with it. The previous regime was woefully unable to exploit it properly, and now it falls to us to expand the coal mining infrastructure here."
 PAV_operation_kingbreaker_fate_of_the_sobor:0 "§MFate of the Zemsky Sobor§!"
 PAV_operation_kingbreaker_fate_of_the_sobor_desc:0 "Rurik's "kingdom" now lies shattered into a million pieces thanks to our victory, but the question remains of what to do with his ministers. The so-called §Y"Zemsky Sobor"§! was the King's idea of a parliament, and the many politicians who were part of it await their fate. What shall be done with them?"

 PAV_operation_raskol:0 "§LOperation: Raskol§!"
 PAV_operation_raskol_desc:0 "All preparations for the invasion of §R[ALT.GetName]§! are complete. Ruled jointly by Old Believers and the Altay people, the unitary and religious nature of their state stands in contrast to our Federation.\n\nAlthough an entirely unambitious government, unlike most others in the region, they nevertheless stand in the way of the unification of Central Siberia, and as such must be defeated completely by our forces and brought into the fold."
 PAV_operation_raskol_institute_secular_authority:0 "§LInstitute Secular Authority§!"
 PAV_operation_raskol_institute_secular_authority_desc:0 "The privileges of the Old Believers in Oyrotia have gone on for far too long. Allowed governmental authority on a religious basis due to the dualistic nature of the Oyrotian state, their ability to rule over the people in the name of God is unreasonable and tyrannical. We must put a stop to it now that we control the territory."

 PAV_operation_empty_words:0 "§OOperation: Empty Words§!"
 PAV_operation_empty_words_desc:0 "§OOperation: Empty Words§! is aimed at striking hard at the military regime in the §R[SAH.GetName]§!, led by one General Andreev. Andreev has supposedly made a great deal of idealistic promises to his people, but it's obvious that these are not but meaningless platitudes. Our offensive will bring this aspiring despot down, and in the process secure a critical rail hub."
 PAV_operation_empty_words_seize_the_abakan_arsenal:0 "§OSeize the Abakan Arsenal§!"
 PAV_operation_empty_words_seize_the_abakan_arsenal_desc:0 "Now that the region of Krasnoyarsk lies under our control, the fruits of this critical lynchpin of Central Siberia now lay open to us. One of them is the military arsenal at Abakan, which contains a treasure trove of valuable arms and munitions. We must seize this facility and get it back up and running again."
 PAV_operation_empty_words_welcome_the_willing:0 "§OWelcome the Willing§!"
 PAV_operation_empty_words_welcome_the_willing_desc:0 "Andreev might have been defeated, but his allies may just be willing to aid our cause. We will reach out to some of his administrators and commanders and try to strike some kind of deal with them. Should they agree, it would make integration of the region all the more simple."

 PAV_operation_tachanka:0 "§SOperation: Tachanka§!"
 PAV_operation_tachanka_desc:0 "§SOperation: Tachanka§! has been a long time coming. The so-called §R[KHA.GetName]§! was one of the main factors in the collapse of the §YCentral Siberian Republic§!, and now it falls to us to put their foolish rebellion down. Their forces are inherently disorganized thanks to their misguided anarchist ideals, and cannot hope to stand up to our might."
 PAV_operation_tachanka_enforce_order_upon_anarchy:0 "§SEnforce Order Upon Anarchy§!"
 PAV_operation_tachanka_enforce_order_upon_anarchy_desc:0 "The Siberian Black Army may lie defeated at our hands, but their misguided ideals have been deeply embedded into the lands now under our control. This cannot stand. We shall purge the taint of anarchism from these lands and crush any who refuse to cooperate."
 PAV_operation_tachanka_disband_the_workers_councils:0 "§SDisband the Workers' Councils§!"
 PAV_operation_tachanka_disband_the_workers_councils_desc:0 "The lands west of the former Black Army have organized themselves into many "workers' councils." These misguided "councils" have done little but hinder the economic development of their lands, and shall henceforth be disbanded, allowing our companies a free hand in developing the territories west of the Yenisei."

 PAV_operation_sole_survivor:0 "§xOperation: Sole Survivor§!"
 PAV_operation_sole_survivor_desc:0 "To the south are the last remnants of the Red Army here in Central Siberia. Alexander Vasilevsky has demonstrated an admirable level of persistence in his duties leading the §R[SVO.GetName]§!, but sadly, his time is up. §xOperation: Sole Survivorr§! is among the more ambitious of our war plans, as it will take our forces through some rather hard terrain. Vasilevsky's forces are well-trained and prepared, so caution must be taken."
 PAV_operation_sole_survivor_the_red_armys_finest:0 "§xThe Red Army's Finest§!"
 PAV_operation_sole_survivor_the_red_armys_finest_desc:0 "The Red Army in Tuva has over two decades of fighting experience under its belt, and many of its members have expressed interest in continuing their service in our army. Integrating these veterans will provide invaluable experience to our own armed forces."
 PAV_operation_sole_propose_the_tuvan_federal_republic:0 "§xPropose the Tuvan Federal Republic§!"
 PAV_operation_sole_propose_the_tuvan_federal_republic_desc:0 "Vasily Shukshin, Mayor of Barnaul, has proposed the creation of a "Tuvan Federal Republic" to better integrate the region into our Federation. Shukshin claims that granting autonomy to the Tuvan people would make them more loyal to our government, if at the cost of limiting our influence in the area. The decision, however, lies in our hands."

 ### Research and Development ###
 PAV_research_and_development_category:0 "Research and Development"
 PAV_research_and_development_category_desc:0 "The face of warfare has changed. Battles are no longer decided by massed infantry and thundering artillery, but by whoever can dominate the skies above contested ground. We have seen examples of this across the world, from South Africa to Indonesia to our own backyards.\n\nIf Russia is to become powerful again, she must not concede her own airspace to the enemy. The great powers of the world have spent years building their air forces, and our own armada pales in comparison in both size and sophistication. It is essential that we make up for lost time, and the best way to do that is by sponsoring any project that may help us achieve aerial supremacy.\n\nThe costs may be high, but they are nothing compared to what we will pay if we surrender the skies of the motherland.\n\n§YProject Status:§!\nProject §RBICHEVATEL§!: [PAVGetRnDProject1Status]\nProject §OBERKUT§!: [PAVGetRnDProject2Status]\nProject §YPROYDOKHA§!: [PAVGetRnDProject3Status]\nProject §GLETUCHAYA LISITSA§!: [PAVGetRnDProject4Status]\nProject §BKROKODIL§!: [PAVGetRnDProject5Status]\n[PAVGetAbakanEntry]"

 PAV_project_bichevatel:0 "Project §RBICHEVATEL§!"
 PAV_project_bichevatel_desc:0 "The fighter is the workhorse of any modern air force, well suited for defending airspace, attacking enemy formations, and protecting bombers over enemy territory. It is vital that we have a fighter capable of competing with anything the Germans, Japanese, or Americans can field. A new design, dubbed the MiG-23, may be just what we are looking for. Sporting variable wing geometry and an experimental radar system, it will be one of the most advanced aircraft in the world."

 PAV_project_2:0 "Project §OBERKUT§!"
 PAV_project_2_desc:0 "There is more to controlling the skies than having the best planes. Land-based aircraft are vital to defending our cities and production centers from air raids, and Russia's aerial defenses are woefully inadequate to defend against a modern bombing fleet. The solution lies in developing a system of surface-to-air guided missiles similar to those of our rivals around the globe. A prototype missile, the S-25, is a strong candidate to lead the next generation of Russian anti-aircraft weapons."

 PAV_project_3:0 "Project §YPROYDOKHA§!"
 PAV_project_3_desc:0 "Defending our own skies is necessary, but if we truly want to contest the air, we must be able to strike at the enemy directly, hitting them where it hurts most. Our current fleet of bombers would be chewed to pieces if they ever tried to raid Germania or Tokyo, but we cannot concede the opportunities presented by strategic bombing of the enemy homeland. A new, supersonic long-range bomber is needed. One design we have received, the M-50, promises to deliver exactly that."

 PAV_project_4:0 "Project §GLETUCHAYA LISITSA§!"
 PAV_project_4_desc:0 "When it comes to interceptor aircraft, the most important factor is unquestionably speed. If the interceptor is fast enough, it can blow past any escort aircraft and run-down cumbersome bombers before they get close to their target. We have received a design for a new interceptor, the MiG-25, that if successful would be one of the fastest aircraft on the planet. A defensive squadron of these planes would make even the Luftwaffe think twice before crossing Russia's borders."

 PAV_project_5:0 "Project §BKROKODIL§!"
 PAV_project_5_desc:0 "The attack helicopter has revolutionized land warfare, allowing troops to receive fire support faster than ground-attack planes could manage and making rapid aerial interruptions of enemy movements far easier. Russia has lagged far behind in the area of helicopter development, but the new Mi-24 Gunship promises to fix that. Heavily armored and equipped with both machine guns and air-to-land missiles, this helicopter will spell doom for any enemy that hears it approaching."

 PAV_project_fuck_pindosi:0 "Project §lABAKAN§!"
 PAV_project_fuck_pindosi_desc:0 "Airmobile infantry are the next generation of the fighting man, faster and more maneuverable than any land-based infantry unit could be. However, the unique nature of their transportation and deployment mean that standard infantry equipment is poorly situated for their needs. A new, more compact assault rifle in the early phases of development dubbed the TKB-011 may be the solution. The 011 could be well suited for the hectic, close quarters fighting our airmobile units often find themselves in."

 PAV_meet_with_industrialists_desc:0 "Outside of the government, nobody in the country has more sway than the captains of industry. They have deep pockets and large networks of influence that allow them to change thousands of minds through advertisement campaigns and political donations. A private summit with the industrialists, where Pokryshkin promises them concessions in exchange for campaign support, would go a long way in convincing the elite that another presidential term is in their favor."

 PAV_encourage_infighting_among_opposition_desc:0 "Pokryshkin's opponents are significantly less of a united front than the government, a fact that is almost exclusively to our advantage. If we can convince some of the myriad factions involved in the Shukshin campaign to cause discontent within his ranks, it will make the opposition unable to effectively campaign against us. The more confusion, the better, and we may even be able to shatter the opposition's unity entirely."
 PAV_hold_military_parade:0 "Hold Military Parade"
 PAV_hold_military_parade_desc:0 "The easiest fallback for a flagging political campaign is stirring up feelings of nationalism among the people. Grand demonstrations of military strength remind potential voters that Pokryshkin has made the country strong, and that he is the only one who can protect them from their myriad enemies. A politicized parade might even suppress the opposition if it can convince them that the army won't tolerate their victory. All in all, this would practically be a pro-government rally with tanks."

Behind closed doors, we can happily discard this pretense. Using the security services against the Shukshin campaign may not be fair, but it could be an incredibly effective way to hamper it. Digging (or even inventing) dirt on Shukshin and exposing it in state media would be a powerful way to turn voters against him."

Its President, the aviator Alexander Pokryshkin who is commonly known as the Falcon, runs the state in an increasingly authoritarian manner.\n\nNovosibirsk has also been overwhelmed by the wave of refugees that came from the evacuation eastward, which has caused a multitude of issues.\n\nThe Falcon and his government will have to find solutions to the problems that have started to torment its people if he is to unite the region."

 PAV_the_internal_situation_desc:0 "The internal situation within the Federation has continued to deteriorate in recent months. Leftist revolutionaries have tried to undermine the stability of the state, their methods of doing so have become incredibly heinous.\n\nThe government will have to make difficult decisions on the freedoms of the people in order to take a harsh stance on such dangerous dissent.\n\nOnce the internal situation has been dealt with, we must hope that the regime will be strengthened enough to turn our attention on to our enemies that threaten the region."

 PAV_the_security_question:0 "The Security Question"
 PAV_the_security_question_desc:0 "Law enforcement has steadily become more and more difficult as tensions between the government and political agitators have led to terrorist attacks, which are suspected to have been orchestrated by rebellious socialists.\n\nThese cowardly actions have caused a great deal of domestic instability, which cannot be allowed to continue. Security will have to be improved in order to combat the threat that the terrorists pose to our future.\n\nThe state will have to make these changes to maintain law and order."

As the main federal security agency in Novosibirsk and Barnaul, the SB has kept the Federation safe from socialist and anarchist agitation almost since its foundation.\n\nNow with these new powers, the SB should be able to act with impunity against socialist terrorists, without intervention from local or federal governments. The Narodniks must be ended as soon as possible lest they begin to cause chaos, and the SB is the only thing that will get the job done right."

The group is composed of socialist agitators who are attempting to topple the Falcon's regime. They have perpetuated the violence within our borders for too long, they will have to be dealt with directly.\n\nFirst, we will have to investigate the movements of the group to begin to understand how it functions, as well as who is involved.\n\nBut shortly after that we will have to start clamping down on their atrocious crimes."

 PAV_meet_with_shukshin:0 "Meet with Shukshin"

An agreement must be made between the two parties, otherwise both their prospects will be bleaker.\n\nWe must hope that Pokryshkin finds a beneficial settlement with the mayor, for the betterment of both their people."

He will learn of the benefits of living under the authority of Pokryshkin, Shukshin will also be made aware of the need to pay for such a vital service.\n\nShukshin will have to listen to our demands, for the sake of Barnaul's security he will offer his farmlands. The fertile fields of Barnaul will be used to the betterment of the entire population of the Federation, not just the people who live under the mayor.\n\nHe will learn that he must cooperate with our interests."

We can not allow violence to occur, we owe the people peace within the borders that they live, they surely understand this. The government has to tighten its control over the state, after all they are aware of the dangerous alternatives to stronger authority.\n\nBecause of this reason, they must be allowed to strengthen their grip, they know what is and is not good for the Federation and they will make sure everyone is safer."

 PAV_the_soldiers_soviet:0 "The Silovik State"
 PAV_the_soldiers_soviet_desc:0 "In contrast to its neighbors in the region, the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay is a Silovik State: a polity where the political processes are under the guiding hand of the former and sometimes current military personnel. As a result, many civilian bureaucrats wishing to participate in traditional party politics find themselves barred from running for office, and the compliance demanded by the Siloviks of their non-military counterparts can often be too much.\n\nAnd all of this - they are by design. Russia has moved past the need for a Soviet Union, for a Central Siberian Republic, or for the monstrous and brutal ideologies that seek to dominate Russian political thought. The pedestrians my chant, "fucking Siloviki, man," at every injury, but they are not aware of the bastion that protects them from the harm of ideological thought."

 PAV_the_champions_of_industry_desc:0 "One hallmark that distinguishes the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay from the likes of the mystical king in Kemerovo, the Black Army in Kansk, and the Republic in Tomsk is the presence of corporations that dominate the daily life of its citizens. Three of the most dominant are the Feniks, Sibir, and Titan, each specializing in the different sectors of the economy. The Feniks, the most aggressively pro-Silovik of them all, are manufacturers of military equipment. The Sibir, who are vaguely aligned with Mayor Shukshin of Barnaul, is the primary source of our agricultural tools as well as financial experts. Lastly, there are the Titans, the leading pioneers and technocrats within Novosibirsk's society.\n\nWhen the time comes, President Pokryshkin will have to decide where his allegiances lie. Perhaps, down the road, he may even choose the people instead. All is possible, in the city where the sun sets."

 PAV_the_rising_phoenix:0 "The Rising Phoenix"
 PAV_the_rising_phoenix_desc:0 "There is a long history between President Pokryshkin and the Feniks Corporation. The state relies on the latter to provide military equipment for defense against its neighbors, and the former provides them with political clout to protect their labor practices... or lack thereof. Founded by prospective Siloviks after the fall of the Central Siberian Republic, it has enjoyed close relations with the Federation in general, and the office of the Presidency in particular. They are certainly a reliable partner, steadfast in their dedication towards defending the Federation from external, material threats.\n\nWho are we to say no? The Sibir may offer increased agricultural production and economic growth, but these factors will not defend Novosibirsk from all who choose to plunder its wealth. No - to match its defense in the political realm against extremism, the state needs armaments to fight it in the day-to-day life as well. When the Republic calls, the Feniks shall answer."

 PAV_the_siberian_bear:0 "The Siberian Bear"
 PAV_the_siberian_bear_desc:0 "The Sibir Corporation has a bit of an odd history regarding its founding. In the public's image, it is associated with the Mayor of Barnaul, Vasily Shukshin, one of the rare civilian politicians that had found success within Novosibirsk's Silovik-dominated political system. Founded by the landowning bourgeoisie that had come into existence after the fall of the Central Siberian Republic, they produce agricultural equipment and produce, as well as financial institutions that have helped many in Novosibirsk escape the poverty of the working class.\n\nTheir question is both political and economic: the Feniks has been in a business relationship with the Federation since their founding, and signing contracts with Sibir is a risk. However, Russia will not be at war forever, and military equipment will not help us against the grip of poverty. If the President wishes to quell extremist thought within his Federation, then the best antidote may be economic prosperity."

 PAV_glory_to_the_pioneers:0 "Glory to the Pioneers"
 PAV_glory_to_the_pioneers_desc:0 "Progress is the sole keyword of the Titan Corporation. Specializing in delivering technological solutions to mundane problems, they have become the forefront in Central Siberian science, competing directly with the Modernists in Tomsk. Considering that they were cut from the same cloth, it is no wonder that they are so successful. However, unlike the idealist Modernists, the scientists, technocrats, and investors of the Titan Corporation do not care much about their contribution to universal science. They are a scientific organization within a free market: therefore they must compete. Sadly, this apathy extends to their labor practices, with long hours and hard work expected of the average employee.\n\nThe Federation will invite the wrath of the people should it choose to side with the Titan. However, we all are not so privileged to pay the price of progress."

 PAV_overtures_to_the_people:0 "Overtures to the People"
 PAV_overtures_to_the_people_desc:0 "The people of the Federation are restless. They look upon the power of the Junta and the corporations with worry and apprehension. In order to placate the people, we should loosen the reigns ever so slightly. This is not to say we will let them have free reign, but a lighter touch is perhaps the smarter way forward.\n\nFirst, we should lessen the restrictions on the press. Allowing a freer press will give the people a way to see the benefits of our rule. Of course, the proper content restrictions will still apply, after all, it would be foolish to allow the slander of the Federation.\n\nSecond, we will need to give the unions a slightly larger degree of autonomy. Giving the workers a, state-sponsored, union to air their grievances too will allow us to better keep them under wraps. These unions will, of course, have only so much power and will ultimately answer to the government.\n\nFinally, there must be a general de-escalation of repression against the middle-class in particular. While they will still need to be restricted, a lessening of restrictions will grant us better support amongst them, and will therefore allow us to better control the working class."

 PAV_always_an_even_trade:0 "Always an Even Trade"
 PAV_always_an_even_trade_desc:0 "The Federation is, like many other polities, a collectivity arranged upon the interests of many. Classes, corporations, unions, and the government - these all vie for supremacy within a system that allows their forces to coalesce and compromise. As such, the Federation's political system is always a zero-sum game. A move made somewhere can never be reverted. It is a harsh system, but politics have been pitiless and cruel since the beginning of time.\n\nAs such, the President's decisions will matter in a lot of ways - but we cannot foretell what the future holds for the Federation. All he must do is to live with the consequences of his actions, should they arise. Novosibirsk and Altay gaze at the future, and a cautious optimism rises in the heart of its citizens. Someday, what Bukharin had built as the center of Siberia shall be the beating heart of a new Russian political system."

An army whose soldiers cut their teeth on the front lines of the Siberian War, before our eventual secession from the Republic that has since shrunk back into Tomsk. By studying our past battles and examining our successes and failures, we can improve the effectiveness of our forces.\n\nThe experience of our troops will likely give us a great advantage in future conflict, as the armies of our neighbors remain undisciplined and under equipped."

These soldiers will be skilled in breaking through enemy front lines, limiting the amount of damage future wars will have on our army and citizenry.\n\nFurthermore, deployment of these elite troops will certainly continue to heighten our military edge over the rest of the region and deter any warlord or state foolish enough to plan an invasion against us."

 PAV_the_skies_are_ours:0 "The Skies are Ours"
 PAV_the_skies_are_ours_desc:0 "An air force is a rare asset to any force in Central Siberia, or indeed the rest of Russia, but Novosibirsk was fortunate enough to inherit the majority of the Central Siberian Republic's air force, along with many of its officers who now make up our government. Included among the officers who set up the new government is President Pokryshkin, the "Siberian Falcon" himself.\n\nImprovement of the existing infrastructure and air bases, as well as development of new technology for our air force has proven a popular idea amongst these ministers who plan to push forward these proposals. The skies of Central Siberia will remain ours to control."

 PAV_mechanized_infantry:0 "Mechanized Infantry"
 PAV_mechanized_infantry_desc:0 "As one of the few states of Russia that still maintains a capable and decently sized industry, we should use it to our advantage and expand our mechanized forces. Our federation's armed forces will gain a great technological advantage, as other states remain comparatively unarmored.\n\nThe increased maneuverability will also help to capitalize on any breakthrough we make, which would make us become an unstoppable military force."

 PAV_the_fruits_of_the_siberian_plan_desc:0 "Novosibirsk was one of the places that benefitted the most from Bukharin's Siberian Plan, our industry has subsequently seen a decent step up in its output. The federation's economy is still developing because of it, with new factories continuing to open, advancements being made in construction technology and the expansion of infrastructure across the state.\n\nAll of these factors have greatly improved our industrial efficiency, allowing us to produce a greater volume of equipment for our military, bringing us another step closer to national reunification."

 PAV_the_virgin_lands_campaign:0 "The Virgin Lands Campaign"
 PAV_the_virgin_lands_campaign_desc:0 "A new plan has emerged from our government to help alleviate the large amount of stress that has been put on our agricultural output. Put simply, as our population has inflated, our production of grain has not. This issue is rapidly becoming the greatest crisis in Novosibirsk, besides the enduring pandemic.\n\nFortunately, the plan our government has come up with deals with both the food shortage and the disproportionate population, by resettling refugees in farmsteads where the land is yet to be cultivated. Ultimately, this will start improving agricultural output and the lives of the refugees."

 PAV_crack_down_on_the_strikes:0 "Crack Down on the Strikes"
 PAV_crack_down_on_the_strikes_desc:0 "Workers have started to resort to direct action. Factories lay dormant and hollow throughout every city; production has slowed to a sluggish pace. We can only assume that the workers have become uppity because of their "unfair" conditions, but we cannot concede, or they will soon be asking for the earth. Our government has determined to crush these strikes and put the working classes back to work.\n\nThe crackdowns will escalate tension with our workers, but a few disgruntled factory labourers being put back to work would be a much more preferable outcome than constant deadlock and economic inefficiency."

 PAV_ramp_up_arms_production:0 "Ramp Up Arms Production"
 PAV_ramp_up_arms_production_desc:0 "The army will need more arms if it is to continue to expand large enough to absolutely dominate the region and bring the rest of the lands of Central Siberia into the Federation, through threats or force. An increase in production quotas for all armaments is to be ordered by the government to help with the expansion of the armed forces.\n\nMany of the recent actions of the government have upset the workers, this is unlikely to improve the situation. And if the tensions persist, grave consequences will face the Federation in the future."

The city is so rich that even the few beggars that remain appear fed and decently clothed. Such spectacles are a stark contrast to the anarchy of the east and destruction to our west.\n\nIt appears that our decisions have turned out better than we could have ever expected, not that there was ever any doubt of their success. Developments in agriculture, industry and even our stability have made Novosibirsk the most desirable city throughout Siberia, despite the cost of some freedoms."

 PAV_our_destiny_made_manifest:0 "Our Destiny Made Manifest"
 PAV_our_destiny_made_manifest_desc:0 "Novosibirsk has spent the last arduous months fighting its internal issues: drugs, crime and socialist agitators, but these problems have been solved and our position has become strengthened. Instead of looking in, it is time to look out from our current borders. Generals have already been ordered to start drawing up their war plans, in preparation for the battles that they are to fight. With the fight of the Federations army under their command, our conquest of Central Siberia is all but assured.\n\nFor the Falcon's wings are no longer clipped and it is time for the Federation to take flight."

When night falls and the earth grows dark, the Security Service prowl the streets of the city, seeking to root out those who oppose the righteous dictatorship.\n\nThus is the unspoken motto of the Federation: democracy at sunrise, a monarchy at midday, and a dictatorship at the end of the day. Quiet falls over the fields of Siberia, and no whispers of deceit could be heard: not from communists or idealists. Only the beating heart of Russia sustains its pace in the silence."

The Central Siberian Republic, the culmination of this blazing passion, shattered as soon as the wind blew against the course of their destination.\n\nFrom our sanctuary in the heart of Siberia, the Federation marched out, triumphing over the remnants of the Central Siberian Republic. For here, we shall say: no, to the brutality of idealism. No, to the senseless waste of ideology. No, to the unbridled rage of humane passion.

The Narodniks, Communists, Anarchists, Idealists, Rurikids - all are priests of false gods masquerading as an intent of human innovation and improvement. Nothing they offer could enlighten a person to his sovereignty. The noise and din offer nothing but flirtations with the meaningless.\n\nThe Federation has embraced the silence. Where ideals had once been worshipped, we have dragged the idols of these ersatz divinities and cast them out. There is nothing noble in idealism. The act of believing in a higher ideal does not render one a paragon. The brutality of ideologies is over, and sovereignty reigns alone, supreme."

The vote was closer than we liked, and there is work to be done before the next round of elections eventually come around.\n\nDistricts and voting precincts must be redrawn to better represent the loyal citizens of the Federation and avoid empowering radical elements.

A few of them were his friends, but all were comrades. In the neatly ceramic-tiled dining chamber, the bawdy jokes of the aces echoed down the silent halls, booming through the rooms of the Presidential Palace.\n\nSome of them did not partake in the festive occasions, however. Standing on the edges of the crowds were silent onlookers whose faces were tinted with a colorless pallor: of joy long lost. The war might have left Novosibirsk and Altay, for now. For these, it never left them. Call it battle fatigue, shell-shock, Pokyrshkin sighed. There was no cure to the eternal affliction of soldiers.\n\nA hand tapped his shoulders. "Mr. President!" a powerful voice thundered behind him, catching Pokryshkin off-guard. "Long time no see." The man looked askance at him as if expecting a trigger to click in his head.

Vast expanses, laden with resources, people, and strategic positions. Expanses that would, in time, fall under the Federation's control.\n\nIt was only natural, he continued, that the Federation, with Novosibirsk at its heart, possessed a special destiny not seen elsewhere in Siberia. It was the largest city east of the Urals, formed a critical junction on the primary route of travel across Siberia, and lay in a major region of development of Bukharin's Siberian plan.\n\nWas it not, he concluded, therefore logical that the Federation would leverage those advantages to reclaim lands rightfully belonging to it? Further, having accomplished that goal, was it not similarly logical that the Federation would continue expansion, over all of Siberia?\n\nOf course it was, Pokryshkin thundered. It was not only logical, it was inevitable. It was right. The Federation had a destiny, a right, to unite Siberia. It would do so. And on that great day, would it stop? No, he said decisively. It would continue pursuing its final destiny - dominion over all of Russia.\n\nWhen he was finished, all applauded. All agreed that it had been a fine speech.

It was clear they meant business, and in Novosibirsk, there was little more valuable than meaning business.\n\nA few people whispered, here and there; a friend of a friend had said this or that about the government wanting to eradicate terrorism, and that the police presence was to keep an eye on the ordinary people that the Narodniks blended into so easily. Soon, the whole street knew the news, then the streets nearby, and by the end of the day everyone in the city knew they might be unknowingly watched at any moment. For once, all the complaints of the citizenry was silenced, all their usual bravery frozen in place.

Fear.\n\nEvery boot that hit the ground, every glare shot at a gathered crowd, every officer placed at a key position to keep watch as all manner of people passed by, served only to reinforce that fear, a sort of dread comparable to being caught in a spider's web with no escape. As the days passed and the people grew used to the officers, however, the sense of fear settled down into a feeling of security, of protection. The spider's web had begun to feel more like a safety net for the common person.\n\nAs for the uncommon person- the Narodnik, the spy, the common thief- the spider quickly began to feast.

For many years it had been a difficult existence. But no longer. Now the rewards long promised were finally being delivered.\n\nThe benefits pledged by the Siberian Plan had been realized, and economic activity within the Federation was rapidly increasing, both vertically and horizontally. That meant more factories, more jobs, and more production. It also, critically for Mikhail and his contemporaries, meant more money. Lots more.\n\nHe had been watching the stock market all morning, and the shares listed upon it had done nothing but rise. For his company. For the companies of his friends. And, most of all, for the companies that the government had chosen to favor. Even better, the rise showed no signs of stopping.\n\nIt was truly a great day. Of course, there were those who claimed the money was not going where it was needed, or that it should be redirected to those more in need of it, with the exact definition of that 'need' left purposefully nebulous.\n\nBut Mikhail paid them no mind. Wherever the money was going otherwise, enough was coming to him. And, truly, was anyone else more deserving?"

The Nazi jackboot had fallen on them over twenty years ago, and showed no signs of being lifted anytime soon.\n\nIndeed, from what little news had reached Central Siberia from those lands, the entire peninsula had been treated as a colonial project by the German Kriegsmarine, and his people had, as would have been expected, suffered terribly. To those few countrymen he had spoken to over the years, there was little hope of ever changing this, and for a long time he had thought the same.\n\nBut the aircraft he now sat in had changed those thoughts. The Federation had many challenges, yes, but unlike many of the states around it, it was still innovating. It was still designing. While others looked to the past, it was looking forward - socially, technically, economically, and militarily. It was looking forward to unification, of Central Siberia and, eventually and with luck, beyond.\n\nPerhaps, in time, it could look once again upon the lands of the Crimean Tatars.

It was a beautiful time of unfettered idealism and shaky hope in a murky future, and in between debates and briefings, Ob's glimmering waters were always waiting for him. He would find a perch on the rocks, gazing out at the gently rippling waters and listening to the distant cries of birds over the murmur of the river. Idle thoughts would drift lazily through his head or on some days, he would scribble away at some unborn writing project, or simply lay upon the shore in a half asleep stupor dreaming of things to come.\n\nNow, however, things were changing. The waters were getting filthier by the day as more businesses moved into town, raising factories and more along Ob's bay. Although the Federation, and Shukshin's own values, lay based upon freedom, he could not help but feel perhaps it was leniency that had allowed these industrialists to lay claim to his home. In several meetings, Shukshin had brought up his misgivings with the direction of the town's development only to find many of his trusted aides in the pocket of the very same hounds preying upon Barnaul's newfound prosperity. Thus, he went out to the River once again to think. Shukshin felt conflicted with the idea of pushing the pocketed officials out, as each had gotten there through their own merit. Part of him felt it was vanity, the idea of holding something as trivial as the beauty of the nostalgic river over his own values. In the fields just beyond the river, however, he saw men breaking their backs for a day's wage dropped like crumbs by richer men. Was this corruption, in and of itself, a greater tyranny?\n\nStill, he would have to tackle this problem some other way. But how, when it felt only he could see Russia's pain?"

Now though, he could properly enjoy an unbiased paper run by right-thinking Russians telling it like it is.\n\nSitting at the fireplace with a cup of tea and a newspaper felt quite nostalgic for him. On the front page was a picture of striking workers surrounded by corporate security forces. The headline read, "Sibir Worker's Strike! Blood on the Streets." Intrigued, he read through the report. Apparently, workers at a Sibir plant went on strike for higher wages and ended up rioting and killing several Sibir guards. A unit of the army had to be called in to quell the strike and it ended with several dead and wounded.\n\nMikhail couldn't help but be shocked.

The factory he worked at had been bought out by the Sibir corporation and the new regulations they had imposed had left him practically penniless. He could only just afford his room at the flophouse and went without food on most nights.\n\nHe knocked at the door in the appropriate pattern and waited. The door opened and he was dragged inside.

He had read the pamphlets and attended a couple of secret meetings before this, though none as important as this one. The woman looked satisfied by his response, if not particularly enthused.\n\nThe woman looked back over the floor plan before she spoke again, "Welcome, Comrade Siniy. We must prepare for your first assignment. The pigs at the Sibir Corporation have opened a new manufacturing plant for the production of top of the line small arms. It will be our job to relieve the plant of its new manufacturing specs, and to cause as much damage to the plant as we can."\n\nAleksandr, or Comrade Siniy as he was now known, felt his throat tighten as a submachine gun was pressed into his hands.

If he didn't know better he'd swear that some of these men were more rat-eaten than their parachutes, though that also wasn't saying much.\n\nThey needed modernization badly, especially in these times, with the Federation surrounded by enemies and potential enemies. There was no question about that. The only question was, how should he go about modernizing them? Their training was in the most obvious need of reform, so certainly he should start there. Even if he were to acquire the finest of materiel, they'd be no good in the hands of men unworthy of holding them. One of the airborne troops was startled awake by his passing, nearly falling over, and Margelov glared at the man in contempt.\n\nThis was certainly going to be a long and arduous journey."

The applause as the respected veteran rose from his seat was much louder than when the seemingly irrelevant commander had stood up to introduce him. After greeting his old friends, he sat down again to speak to the young recruits about his experience. Question after question, he answered them all directly and with honesty.\n\n"Mr. Suvorov, how did you come to be an instructor in the Federation's Army?" one of the soldiers asked.\n\nThe veteran was quick to reply. "You see, back when I was in the army, things were not so bright in these lands. The old republic was fighting a seemingly endless war against Yagoda's hawks, but it was failing and I felt like I had to do something about it. That was when I met President Pokryshkin, who was one of the few to look at the situation not through an overly idealistic lens." He was interrupted by someone asking if he had really met the President, but he shrugged it off as nothing too important. "He was planning to bring peace to Novosibirsk and Altay, and I decided to join him in the endeavour. As you know, he succeeded, and here we are."\n\n"Mr. Suvorov, is it true you fought off a communist tank on your own?"\n\n"That is a real story, yes..." he replied chuckling. "We had been in the forests up north when we were attacked by a tank unit. I was away from my platoon, but I was quick enough to grab an old anti-tank weapon and fire it. Unfortunately, others were not so lucky - one of my friends died trying to distract an invading unit." There was silence for a moment. "But the mission was still successful. It was sacrifices like these that got us where we are now, and it is sacrifices like these that will be necessary to restore order to the nation, once and for all. Any other questions?""

He had this. Pokryshkin didn't want to be a leader to a flight squadron, much less a state, and yet those under his care had not only survived, they had thrived. Things weren't perfect, of course, the terrorists plaguing his lands were proof of that, but nevertheless, life was tolerable.\n\nHe pushed the stick forward, a smile filling his weathered face as he dived down. He never really had time to fly these days, nor the opportunity. Always a AA gun from Tomsk or Kemerovo, always a Kazakh raiding party that had strayed too far, always a foe that needed combating - but today was not one of those days. Today he was free.\n\nAs he wheeled around to face home, Pokryshkin couldn't help but marvel at the city his forces controlled. The smoke of the factories of Novosibirsk was almost comforting, and the distant booming and lights of artillery that had once been terrifying felt in some strange way familial.\n\nHe hadn't wanted to be a leader, but he knew that if he did not fight for his people, then someone far worse than he would.

But, no matter what they did, they could not get ahead. There were simply too many people, and not enough well-paying jobs.\n\nThe years of bitter disappointment were such that when his wife told him to sign up for the government's supposed new program, he almost had not done so, thinking it pointless. But now, standing along the road beside her and looking at the vast tracts of overgrown wildlands in front of them, he silently gave thanks once again. Because the land was now theirs.\n\nThe program intended to address the refugee 'problem' by settling them on vast tracts of untilled land, removing them from the overpopulated communities while, hopefully, acting to increase agricultural output. Konstantin didn't know how successful the former would be, but he knew very well that, at least in his case, the latter very much would be. He would make sure of it.\n\nThere was a lot of very hard work to do. The house had to be essentially rebuilt. The fields needed to be cleared and planted. Harvests needed to be planned.

He harkened back to the times under Bukharin, where the workers were given generous rights and conditions in the factories were as safe as they could be made. Behind him was hung a tattered flag of the Soviet Union. The workers of Novosibirsk had decided they would not stand for their continued abuse.\n\nAs he came to a lull in his oratory there was a change in the air. The corporate goons had retreated to the offices across the street, and it soon became obvious why. Two corporate IFVs rolled down the street towards the crowd, a man with a megaphone calling for the strikers to return to work. When his demands were unanswered the IFVs unleashed canisters of teargas into the crowd. Cries went up as those nearest the gas panicked and fled, eyes and lungs burning. Corporate goons advanced on the crowd, beating those they caught with batons.\n\nThen a shot rang out.\n\nPanicking workers trampled each other to get out of the line of fire while Corporate security fired wantonly into the crowd.

Immediately after sitting down, a man wearing an old army uniform entered into the room, differing in age compared to the mostly young students who made up the Narodnik cell. "Good evening, comrades," said the older man. "I am pleased to welcome our newest recruit, Anton Levitsky, to the revolution. As you know, our fight against the tyrannical Alexander Pokryshkin is only just beginning. The Narodniks as a whole have seen much success, yet our cell has done little to assist the rest of our comradery. If the revolution is to succeed, we must aim for larger targets."\n\n"Like what?" Said Anton, turning on his audio recorder. "The army has stepped up their game, and we have become a massive priority for the Novosibirsk government."\n\n"I'm sure you know of the many rail lines that cross the Ob river," said the commander. "Taking down an entire bridge will have Novosibirsk cut in half for months!.\n\nAnton grimaced while the other Narodniks cheered."If I may ask, commander, but where are we going to get enough explosives to destroy the bridge, and who's going to do it? Looking around, we don't seem very qualified," Anton said.\n\n"The commander smiled.

Replied Pavel, and the others agreed.\n\n"Wait-" but it was too late, the others were already following their commander. Anton cursed under his breath and ran after them.\n\nReaching the ridge, Pavel frowned. "Anton, why hasn't the bridge exploded yet? Did the fuse break?"\n\nAnother Narodnik pointed to the bridge. "Commander, the SB! We've got to get out of here!" Looking at the bridge, it appeared the officers had realized the Narodniks were not falling for Anton's trap, instead heading over to cut the fuse.\n\n"Shit! We've got to go before they see us."

Yahontov had been associating with suspected Narodniks for several weeks prior to the bombing, and appears to have collaborated with two other individuals: Sergei Preobrazhensky (died in the explosion), and Alexei Turgenev (Reported sick day of the incident, was not found at his residence when investigated). The manager of the manufacturing plant was not harmed, and is quite incensed by what he sees as the government's failure to contain the Narodnik threat.\n\nCurrent estimates place damages at a cost equivalent to 2,000,000USD. There are 17 reported deaths and over 30 wounded, of which 17 are in critical condition. Currently, 5 employees of the plant are not accounted for, with the site too damaged and obstructed to allow further searches until a later point in time.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Narodnik threat was greater than previous predictions.

Alongside information extracted from I. Yahontov, a series of raids were conducted. Over 17 arrests have been made against the Narodniks and their allies. Among these arrests are also severely agitated workers distributed weapons by the Narodniks. While not all of the currently arrested terrorists have been interrogated, it was clear that the Narodniks were targeting working class demographics with propaganda, and had already succeeded in converting workers to their cause. Currently, known Narodnik-sympathizers are still being brought in and investigated.

Perhaps depression was the better word, from all the changes that surrounded Pushkin's world.\n\nThe first was seeing his second home, the Humanist headquarters, tapped off by soldiers, denying him and his comrades entrance into the building. "Your organization," said the officer in charge, "has been outlawed. Disperse, before you are dealt with." They did, and the sudden horror dawned on him there of how bad things were going to get.\n\nThe second was much less concrete, but just as real. The morale of the people of Tomsk had been destroyed, sucked up and spat out. Friends, who weeks prior had waved and shared wonderful memories together, barely looked at each other, let alone spoke. The park, once so filled with wandering, smiling faces, had been replaced by soldiers armed to the teeth.\n\nIt was as if all hope, all idealism, had been bleed from them, just as their men had been bleed on the battlefield.\n\nPushkin sighed. Perhaps the grand experiment was never realistic. Perhaps it was better to get your head out of the clouds, and focus on the real world. Maybe these new men, with their hard faces and cold hearts, had the right idea after all."

It was coming along well, if he said so himself, but to say that it was up to the same level of quality similar designs had had under the Siberian Republic would be a lie. He sighed, rubbing at his tired eyes.\n\nWhen the Federation troops came pouring in, few could believe it, and, before anyone could even react, the Republic's flag, waving above Tomsk, came tumbling down. It seemed, to Kamov's horrified eyes, that the whole experiment had failed.\n\nAnd the experiment's subjects, the people of Central Siberia, had undergone a change that Kamov, as a scientist, found shocking. Almost over night, the people and their optimism, once so filled with hope and joy, had shriveled up into a rotting husk. And that new atmosphere, the atmosphere of some corporate overlord, had expanded to the research division that Kamov worked in.\n\nAlthough the designs remained the same, the people changed. No longer was radical experimentation allowed. Now, it was all about 'efficiency' and 'results'. No longer would the halls of science be filled with creativity, intrigue, learning, and breakthroughs. Now it was going to be about how to make something easier to manufacture, easier to transport, and easier to make in bulk.\n\nKamov's helicopter was just one victim. He had no motivation to make the best possible, no reason to push the boundaries. Now, he felt like just one more researcher in a sea of thousands, all vying for some nebulous benefit.\n\nAnd it ate Kamov up inside."

For the past twenty minutes, he had been arguing with the mayor of Barnaul over the fate of the so-called Zemsky Sobor, and once again the two men found themselves at an impasse.\n\nMayor Shukshin rubbed his temples, his eyes weary and distant. "If we keep ripping up local administrations and replacing them, it's only going to mean more work for us. Time we could've spent on more important matters will instead be wasted on sorting out bureaucracy." He sighed. "I'm not suggesting we keep the Sobor, rather, update it to fit our needs."\n\nPokryshkin turned to Shukshin. Perhaps his colleague had a point. After all, what's the purpose of demolishing a perfectly functional administration just to replace it with something that serves the same purpose? On the other hand, the president knew that keeping the Sobor in any form would encourage a certain degree of autonomy..."

At first Sokolov had expected the new job to be easy. How hard could dealing with a couple of backwards peasants really be?\n\nVery, very difficult. Already, he had to deal with the reality that he had no legitimacy. These people did not choose him, an outsider. Sokolov, no matter his personal beliefs, was a member of the Federation government, a distant, unknowable collection of bureaucrats and politicians who knew nothing about them. This Sokolov resented, if only because he had been briefed a significant amount by Zavoloko, who, in his wisdom, thought it would be important for Sokolov to understand the needs of the people. Apparently, Sokolov thought with bitterness, some didn't think that was enough.\n\nHe sighed. Perhaps he was being too negative. He had, over the course of the last couple weeks, been successful in removing most of the incompotent administrators under Zavoloko, who, by and large, were preachers, and not bureaucrats. At the very least it would show that Sokolov was trying to make an effort. Besides, the cash would begin to flow Oyrotia soon, to show how valuable a unified, centralized Russia could be.\n\nPerhaps, Sokolov thought, for the first time in days, these people can learn to trust again."

Coming face to face with the man who overthrew his government, and on the other side of a jail cell, conjured up images that Pesterev would rather not have.\n\nAnd so they sat there, waiting for the other to make a move, up until Pokryshkin spoke up.\n\n"Mr. Pesterev," said Pokryshkin, "I understand that you and Andreev are on less than stellar terms."\n\n"Considering that I'm in a jail cell, yes, me and him are not exactly the best of friends at the moment."\n\nPokryshkin laughed.

I've always preferred to think of human life as having a little bit more value alive than dead, or in prison."\n\nPesterev felt his eyebrows raise a little, wondering where this was going.\n\n"I have a proposition for you, if you would like to hear it."\n\n"A proposition...?"\n\nPokryshkin pulled out a piece of paper, and slid it in between the metal bars. "I am not an expert in the affairs of Krasnoyarsk, or its people. Nor do I think I could learn it in the time necessary to make a difference. That is why I am offering you an opportunity to work for me, for your freedom, and for a better future for Russia. You don't have to decide now, b-"\n\n"I'll do it."\n\nPokryshkin stopped, a little shocked at being interrupted. That look, however, disappeared, and was replaced with a smile.

Almost all are holdout generals, militias and other organizations that refused to submit to the will of the Federation, and instead placed their rebellion at the barrel of a gun.\n\nWhat began as outright treasonous acts, openly committed by militiamen, gradually transformed into terrorism against the state and its property. Army compounds were bombed, killing dozens and injuring more. Police headquarters, set up in high population areas, were routinely attacked and looted for firearms, and, as quickly as they were attacked, the HQs were empty of all Red perpetrators.\n\nBut the former Free Territory could only hold out for so long. Soon, as weeks turned to months, some of the diehards began to question whether their acts were in any way helpful to their cause. Soon, as the troops began pouring in, and the compounds and safe houses were raided, the members of the underground Black Army began to dissipate. Some chose to leave the Free Territory, others the whole of Central Siberia. A couple even decided to leave Russia, hoping for a better chance at the revolution abroad.\n\nSome, however, decided to stay, and while they continue their revolutionary activities, the All-Siberian Army has been ever present to combat them.

It had been too embedded into society for that to happen, especially among the working class, who, unsurprisingly, made up most of the Workers Councils. Kansk was the biggest of them, and threatened outright rebellion against the Federation if such an action was ever taken.\n\nThat, of course, was only rhetoric. Everyone knew that, one way or another, the Workers Councils would be destroyed. Many even within the Councils debated what course of action to take, but, despite the radicalism of some members, the majority accepted defeat. The Proclamation was expected, and they tried, with the best of their abilities, to make the transition as best as possible.\n\nBut the next day, it was reported in the papers of Kansk that three different Megacorporations had begun to carve up the formerly worker run factories, shops, and other facilities controlled by the Councils. Within the course of several weeks, the unions, once so powerful, started to accept their old places in the hierarchy of capitalism.

All headed by a man who seemed more interested in moving cities in Siberia then leading a nation at war.\n\nNow here he was, a remnant of another remnant of the Red Army.

This would further encourage the centralization of our authority, but some argue that the federally-administered territories are stretched thin enough as it is, and adding new lands on top of that would only compound our problems.\n\nThe influential mayor of Barnaul, Vasily Shukshin, has put forward a different proposal altogether. He believes it would be necessary to form a new republic within the Federation's borders: the Federal Republic of Tuva. Not only would this make integration a more painless affair, but would also go great lengths towards discouraging separatism.\n\nThe final say, of course, lies with the president..."

Sometimes, however, even his passions would prove frustrating, as Shukshin had spent the past hour and a half debating how to actually start this particular piece.\n\nLaying his pen aside, Shukshin sighed as he reached for his drink.

Now now, I believe in free speech, but I believe that certain intellectuals are slandering our government, and by God I am going to come to its defense!\n\nThe first biggest slanderous lie is that our government is cynical. That is just a boldfaced lie. Our government is not cynical, it is pragmatic. You see, these famous philosophers, they make these funny little words up like 'cynical' and 'corporatization' in order to slander the Federation, but, let's be real here, when has a philosopher ever done something for you? Say what you want about the Federation, but it has brought numerous people out of poverty, brought economic development, and brought order. Sure, maybe they've been a little too heavy handed, but, hey, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of my freedom for the sake of a better future.\n\nThe second, and the one I find the most offensive, is that our Federation is destined for failure, that we're too weak to get anything done. That is not only wrong, it is offensive, to the leaders and generals of this country, who have sacrificed countless man hours just to keep you and I safe from the hoards that lay behind our borders. We have a strong economy, strong leaders, and strong soldiers, who are going to be made even stronger by the first two.\n\nAnd the Federation will be made even stronger as the years go by, as economic development increases continually. According to some analysts, we may even become stronger than Germany when taking into account reunification and economic development.\n\nNow, to my fellow patriots, I leave you with a good little song that some of you may remember.

Of course, that seemed so much more quaint than the poverty of some after the collapse, but it was still painful.\n\nHe had crawled to the top of the air force, crawled from that slum and from those criminals and hoodlums to become one of the most famous airmen in Russia. And yet, it did nothing. The Germans came marching still, like the Huns of the West, crushing and butchering everything in their paths. He could still remember flying above a town, burnt to the ground, smoke filling the sky. All he could imagine then were the screams, and the flaying bodies.\n\nAnd now, he was the leader of a nation, a nation whose principles seemed so in line with his own. Liberation, freedom, decentralization. Far from the centralized nightmare that was the Soviet Union. And yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get it to work. The pieces wouldn't fit. He couldn't fit the square peg into the round hole.\n\nAnd so he compromised. A stronger office here, a stronger government there, until he realized that the ball of centralization kept going further and further. And now those principles, those principles he sacrificed so much for, had been ripped up.\n\nAnd, the worst part about it, was that he felt nothing. Pokryshkin felt like he should feel something, some sadness at the death of utopianism he had. But he didn't. The compromises, in his eyes, worked. Without them, he wouldn't be where he was. Without them, his people wouldn't be anywhere near as good as they are now.\n\nPerhaps, Pokryshkin thought, the principles of the Federation would be revived. Perhaps the government would give their constituent parts more say in their affairs, more trust in the people. But he doubted that. And so, he looked out the window, just as he did as a young man."

Barnaul was not nearly as important as the great city itself, of course, but it was important enough, and he was important enough within it, to be able to take some form of action.\n\nAnd that action had worked. He had been able, if only for a short while, to delay several measures focused on further increasing that degree of centralization. He knew he should have felt joy, or at least satisfaction, at such success. And yet, he did not, for he knew that though he had slowed the process, he had not, and would not be able to, halt it for very long.\n\nHis influence and popularity would allow him to do so for a while longer, but as he regarded the reports, all he could think about was how much time he had won.\n\nAnd how he knew it would not be much."

He had tired, of course, and it wasn't like he enjoyed working until the AM, but it was something that the man felt as if he had to do.\n\nShukshin's place in the administration of the Federation had placed him front and center in what passed for political machinations of the polity, resulting in his less-than-cynical ideas being the natural foil for his political counterpart, Pokryshkin. But as the documents bled together, the words and letters became increasingly incomprehensible in Shukshin's brain, out of the fog that permeated his mind came the deep worries that only ever emerged on the latest of nights.\n\nHis mind went to the origins of the federation, and how it was originally based on freedom and liberty, but how the necessity of the federation's system had resulted in an erosion of the federation's basic principles, revealing corruption, apathy, and cynicism - unfortunately embodied by many of his political peers. He felt conflicted about his role in the state, and how it would, or wouldn't play out. He had once been a genuine democrat, convinced of the federation's noble methods. But as the situation degraded, Shukshin could do nothing but wonder if his support of Pokryshkin and the federation in general had been worth it.

The sergeant clanged a bell so loud it hurt Fyodor's ears. "Move it, worms! You worthless sacks of shit aren't worthy of being in my beloved army! To the field! Now!" Fyodor's old sergeant in Tomsk wasn't nearly as boisterous, preferring rousing speeches about the defense of democracy against the hordes of the wasteland. This army was different. This army knew it was the big dog in Siberia, and woe betide any who claimed otherwise. Offensive war versus defensive war, supposed Fyodor.\n\nThe men ran, performed live-fire drills, and sparred, all the while enduring the relentless abuse of the sergeant. Despite his former service in the army of Tomsk, Fyodor could have sworn the boot camp he was put through in that former nation was far less strenuous. In this new army, his body was hardened just as his mind was broken and reshaped into a soldier of the Federation.\n\nAs he lay exhausted in his cot that night, brain barely able to form coherent thoughts from the constant fatigue, he briefly pondered the irony that had led him here. Once a defender of democracy, Fyodor was now in service to... well, a slightly different form of democracy. He supposed he could live with that."

Prisoners of war that held officer rank within their now defunct militaries are requesting that we release them from prison and grant them commissions. Ordinarily, I wouldn't hesitate to refuse such a request, but I have seen it fit to pass their desires up to your office. The return of prisoners of war becomes a difficult proposition when the country they were captured form no longer exists. Additionally, these officers, including some of senior rank, could provide invaluable military expertise to our own armed forces.\n\nI have my own personal concerns with this request, as the pardoning of those responsible for waging war against our nation sets a dangerous standard. What we don't need is Narodniks claiming legal precedent for their own pardons. Naturally, the choice is yours, and I will be awaiting your reply.\n\nSigned,\n\nDmitry Glinka, Minister of Defense."

As you know-"\n\n"Yes yes, the backbones of our weapons and agricultural industries. I'm fully aware of what these corporations do around here."\n\n"Al-Alright... Well then.

Meanwhile, Sibir wants to trade primarily with the Sphere. They believe the Sphere can provide unique opportunities that America can simply never provide. This wouldn't be such a problem for our economy, if the two corporations weren't trying so hard to sway us to their side.

Pokryshkin's state was growing rapidly - in economic power, physical size, and military capability - and could, in short order, pose a threat to the interests of the Sphere.\n\nThat is, if it were allowed to forge close relationships with other states without also doing so with Japan itself. In addition, a number of Japanese industrial concerns had voiced the potential benefits of future business relationships with the growing state, and such could not be ignored. Thus, relations had been steadily increasing, and were to be cemented here today.\n\nArriving in front of the Prime Minister, Pokryshkin offered a slight bow, which was immediately returned, and both smiled for the many cameras watching.

Was the Federation's government truly committed to the reform that he had heard promised, and originally dismissed as yet another empty pledge? Were they temporary measures, intended only to placate the thousands upon thousands of workers who had risen in the Great Revolt? And, if so, how long would they last?\n\nFor a long while Grigory debated these questions within himself, until he realized, at long last, that the answer did not matter.

The only response - a simple grimace - was enough to bring the confidant up to speed.\n\n"I thought we had the numbers. I thought we had the names." Pokryshkin muttered as he stared out his window onto the bustling streets of Novosibirsk. His mind calculated his options busily. A distant memory from long ago - a piece of off-hand advice from a friend - floated into his consciousness. "Never make a decision angry." Words Pokryshkin tried hard to live by. "Barnaul's won this round of the game." Pokryshkin stated matter-of-factly, any trace of anger long gone. "But their victory's still a fantasy. He might be getting more popular in the opposition circles, but that means nothing. There will be another battle, another war. And that time, we'll make sure that there's no winning for the bastard of Barnaul."\n\nHis confidant, with little to say, nodded succinctly. It was true - Shukshin's name was whispered from the peripheries of the Duma, it seemed more and more every day - but Pokryshkin was in control."

 PAV_regional.35.desc:0 ""Very good, thank you for the prompt call, Ivan. And remember - say hi to that wife of yours for me. I miss her pelmeni!" Alexander Pokryshkin put down the phone, its receiver clicking soundly as it was cradled. A slight smile betrayed the good news to his company - a good friend and political associate sat opposite him. Not a member of the Federation's Duma, per se, but a corporate liaison between Feniks and the government. A very good person to keep close, for both Pokryshkin and Feniks.\n\n"I take it Ivan brings us good news?" he asked, nearly rhetorically. Pokryshkin nodded.\n\n"The motion passed. Not without a surprising amount of opposition, however. I'll have to have Ivan look into that. Apparently the name 'Vasily Shukshin' has become basically synonymous with some sort of misplaced democratic idealism."\n\nPokryshkin and his associate both chuckled. The former flying ace wore the small smile that Ivan helped paint for the rest of the day. As he got into bed, he couldn't help but feel gratified in his successful curtaining of Barnaul's influence in the Federation."

 PAV_regional.36.desc:0 "Konstantin stared out into the fields of his farm, a gently rocking sea of amber lit up by the cold morning sun. The boards of his porch creaked under his feet as he stepped up to the railing, taking in a breath of the crisp air. Harvest season was almost upon him and he could just about taste it in the wind as he watched his children running, care free, through acres of wheat, playing some game that only existed in their precious little minds. Konstantin let a smile creep across his face, remembering when he and his family were nothing but another group of battered refugees. But things are different now. Better. His children now smiled and laughed and will not have to worry about where their next meal would come from. That last fact was very apparent as Konstantin felt the tell tale scent of a cooking breakfast waft past his nose.\n\nThey'd come so far, and they'd done it all themselves. The blisters and cuts in their hands after clearing acres of brambles, the racket of hammers striking nails and saws biting through wood when they rebuilt the house where breakfast now sizzled in a pan, the soreness in his arms after working for hours sowing the fields... It was all worth it. For once, he felt like he belonged somewhere. This was where he was meant to be, not by grace of God but his own will. Konstantin had a home for his family, beautiful fields with their own bounty to harvest soon, and most of all he was able to watch his children play without a care in the world for the first time in ages."

Just because the Republic fell doesn't mean we can't still look to the future, eh?"\n\nMikhail seemed to consider it silently, finding some solace from the anxiety the whole team felt since Federation troops marched through Tomsk. Luka wished he believed his own words, but he couldn't. After the surrender, he found himself alone with Mikhail, Artyom, and three other scientists looking to him for guidance. He was prepared to work within a command structure and lead a small team on a single project, not make decisions for people that would shape the rest of their lives without any guidance. It wasn't what he wanted, it wasn't fair, and yet, here he was.\n\nThe worst part was the simplicity of the choice offered to them. They would work for Titan, or they would not work at all. The sheer injustice of it drove Luka to tears sometimes, but there was simply nothing else. Titan bought out everything. There was no other way. Something died in him every time he told himself that, but perhaps it was for the best. It made it easier to look at his team members in the eye when he spoke to them.\n\nLuka looked to the rest of his team while Mikhail stared out the window in contemplation. They sat quietly, the usual lively discourse dead and gone. No more theories, no more arguments, no more idealism. Instead, their eyes revealed the same image as in Luka's heart: a lonely flame in the dark, finally sputtering out.\n\n"But... Without the Republic, what are we even working for anymore?" Mikhail asked, desperation once again in his voice.\n\n"The same thing we've always been working towards," Luka said, his lip twisting into a lifeless smile as he repeated the motto of his soon-to-be employer:"

If successful, the benefits to us will be considerable.\n\nWhile we cannot be absolutely sure of American agreement to said missives, our experts have informed us that such acceptance is highly likely in the long term, though they do caution that it is highly likely that the Americans will request additional stipulations. It is as yet unknown what those stipulations could entail.\n\nBut an opportunity must be explored to be realized, and we will do so.

In exchange for military factories, we could ask for some Siberian troops to go into our own overseas military posts and garrisons.

The loss of manpower may be too great, even if it is just for a few months, so we must judge what is worth more.\n\nInstead, it may be better to just trade weapons instead.

 ### Superregional events ###
 
 PAV_superregional.1.t:0 "A Den of Radicals"
 PAV_superregional.1.desc:0 "Pokryshkin tossed the report onto his desk in disgust. It was a general overview on the situation in far eastern Siberia, and reading through it had dashed all traces of optimism he had felt about the region. It wasn't all bad, to be fair. Controlling the port town of Magadan finally gave them access to the sea, and with a little investment Irkutsk could become a major economic and industrial hub. But aside from a few scattered bright spots like those the report was nothing but bad news. The far east had always been difficult to administer, even for a united Russian nation. Now he had to attempt the same task with far less resources than the Empire or the Union had been able to field. And on top of everything else, there was the main topic of the report: Partisans.\n\nBased on early reports alone Pokryshkin's security experts were telling him there were no less than eight organized radical terrorist organizations operating in the far east, and possibly as many as a dozen. They came in all stripes. Fascists, communists, monarchists, anarchists, zealots, Cossacks, separatists, and more besides. The only reason they hadn't already collapsed the entire east into partisan warfare was because they spent as much time fighting each other as the central government. The report warned that might not be the case forever. The longer they are allowed to exist, the more likely it is that like-minded groups will form a common front against the newly formed Russian Federation. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n\nPokryshkin picked up the phone and started dialing the number. If consolidating central Siberia had taught him anything, it was that there was only one way to deal with radicals. They were so wrapped up in their own meaningless theories and ideologies they barely even lived in the real world, and that made them too dangerous to tolerate. They would be dragged out of their holes and brought into the light where the people of Russia could see them for what they were: not brave partisans, but desperate terrorists with no place in the new Russia."

Some slept, their snores inaudible over the rumbling engine. Feodor was seated at the rear of the truck, staring out of the window, while next to him Lev continued to jabber incessantly.\n\n"Hey Feodor, how do you know when you've killed a communist?"\n\n"I don't know Lev, how?" Feodor said.\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls his own blood reactionary and tells it to read more theory!" Lev laughed at his own joke, though Feodor was unamused. Seeing this, Lev tried again.\n\n"How do you know when you've killed a fascist?"\n\nFeodor glared at him\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls you a Jew bastard and says his blood is too strong to leave his body!"\n\nOnce more Lev cackled at his own lack of wit, and once more Feodor remained silent. When Lev finished laughing Feodor spoke.\n\n"Have you ever killed anyone Lev?"\n\nLev looked at him, confused. "Maybe, I've fired my gun in combat a lot but I'm not sure."\n\n"Well, have you ever watched anyone bleed out?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well I have. I've watched five men die. A communist, two anarchists, a fascist, and a Cossack. None of them talked about race or theory while they were dying.""

Machine guns sprayed death barely feet off the ground as the infantry sprang into action, pushing towards the structure in a text-book assault. Ducking into cover just before a dozen slugs which tore through the space that he had formerly occupied, the air went out of his chest. He took a few deep breaths and blinked his eyes once, twice, three times. Good enough. Firing a few bullets at the general direction of the structure, the Sargeant rolled left to join the rest of his unit, already going through the motions of the battle drill.\n\nThe screaming, shooting, and dying lasted all of five minutes before the white handkerchiefs went up, and the black-shirted figures stepped out in surrender, bodies surrounding the once picturesque cabin. As he counted losses, and took in sight, Ivanov gave the sorry looking Blackshirts a glare of contempt, for all their enthusiasm for violence, he had seen Anarchists handle themselves better than these jackbooted thugs."

They were deep in the industrial district of Irkutsk, closing in on the worker's housing that dotted the outskirts of the factories. Their mission was a simple one, to root out elements of Yagoda's NKVD that had survived the strife in the Far-East.\n\nAs they approached their target, he motioned for his men to split into two teams. His team would breach the front of the enemy structure, an abandoned apartment complex. The second team, under the command of Lieutenant Ugolev, would be tasked with breaching the rear entry and preventing the enemy from making a retreat. Ivan approached the doorway into the building unmolested and had his men stack up on the doors. His men entered the building and were met with an eerie silence. The men went about securing the first floor and found nothing, there was no sign this floor had been inhabited in years.\n\nIvan left three men behind in the lobby to act as a rearguard and pressed forward towards the stairwell. This would be the most dangerous part of the operation, traversing the stairwell into the second and third floors. He crept up the stairs slowly, keeping watch for any sort of traps. It was as he ascended the last step that he heard the gunfire from the base of the stairs. They had used the elevator shaft to get behind them.\n\nIvan began to shout out orders but was cut off as he had to dive for cover as soldiers on the second floor opened fire. He was only able to take rare potshots at his assailants. He was able to drop one before being hit in the shoulder. His rifle clattered from his grasp and fell down the stairwell. He cursed and drew his sidearm, only to be perforated by fire from a man on the stairs above him.\n\nIvan's body tumbled onto his men below. Before the NKVD could celebrate, the rear team made their appearance. The communists were defeated, but it was a pyrrhic victory at best."

Large numbers of insurgents and dissidents have been captured or killed, enormous quantities of material have been captured, and insurgent leadership has been greatly compromised.\n\nConcurrently, elements of state government have returned to, or been established in, areas declared secured from partisan influence. This has not only returned life to normal for millions of our citizens, but greatly strengthened our control of, and extraction from, the regions in question.\n\nHowever, we must take care to not grow complacent. Though activity has, through vigorous and sometimes bloody action, decreased, fanatical elements do remain, and they are still to be considered extremely dangerous.\n\nWe must stay the course.

He had thought that to be his eventual fate as well, but then, accompanying his father into the village to sell their produce, he had seen the poster.\n\nMen were needed, it said, to fill out the many new commissariats the Federation had established throughout the Far East. To help distribute supplies, provide order and, of course, secure the land for the state. It also offered pay. Pay far in excess of what Ruslan could earn selling vegetables. And, so, after seeing his father to market he had walked towards the enlistment booth set up in the square.\n\nHis father had not been happy, but he had, in the end, understood.

At the same time, the promise of riches and greatness has attracted many from across the Federation to the city, making Magadan grow and even blossom.

He woke every morning in the pitch dark, marched until he was exhausted, instructed and then tested on the lessons afterwards, shoveled as much food down as possible, and then fell into an exhausted sleep. Only to repeat the process the next day.\n\nDespite the hardship, however, Ruslan could not say that he hated the experience. He was learning skills, both military and organizational, and was making many friends besides. Friends from all over the region, from areas he had only ever heard of in passing, and they were fascinating.\n\nHe could not wait until he completed training, and got a chance to see the lands of whatever region he was assigned to.

Margelov could barely make out the words, however, too lost in his own thoughts. As confident as he was in their ability, only more hardship awaited them now as they began to move west. He was confident that they were ready, of course. The question was, would being ready be enough? There was no way of knowing if even the best of Russia's soldiers could win the wars to come, and more importantly, which of them would make it back alive.\n\nAs the man before him finished his report, Margelov nodded and sent him off, to be alone with his thoughts and anxieties."

It was still hard to believe that the Presidency, for so long the preview of Pokryshkin and his ilk, was now in the hands of a peasant from Atlay, but he was here, and it was his.\n\nPicking up one of the many pages on his desk Shukshin looked over it once more, slowly flipping through its contents. Workers protections, new regulations encompassing lobbying, and other vectors of corporate influence, stringent antitrust laws. It wouldn't be enough to defang the corporations, not by a long shot. Their influence reached far too deep for a mere piece of legislation to reverse the impact of a decade of unfettered exploitation, but it was a start.\n\nThe corporate giants, and Pokryhkin's clique, would fight them every step of the way. Their lackeys in the Duma, and the Siloviki who had long been paid off with corporate gold. Shukshin, however, had the will of the people-and the power of the Presidency-on his side."

 PAV_superregional.12.t:0 "A Writer and a Falcon"
 PAV_superregional.12.desc:0 "It was early in the morning when the two men met in one of the many rooms of the Presidential palace, flames flickering in the fireplace, snowmelt falling from the frost-covered roof. The new and former President of the Siberian Federation glancing at each other uneasily. They had been friends once, comrades in arms during the final days of the Republic. Those days were gone, a friendship strained and broken amidst the rise of the Federation.\n\n"Where did it all go wrong Vasily? Where did we lose our way." Shukshin glanced up at Pokryshkin's voice, the Falcon of Siberia staring down into his drink. There was no malice in eyes, no resentment, just a colorless pallor, and a resigned expression.\n\nShukshin stared at his own drink, for he had no response. No answer to the question that he himself had pondered on many a sleepless night. He could still faintly remember the optimism in the Federation's early days, the final break from the decaying Republic amidst the chaos of the Siberian War and Anarchist revolt. A time where the Federation seemed to have a place for everybody, regardless of ideology or wealth. Before the corruption and cynicism set in, before the rise of the Siloviki and the Corporations.\n\nHe could point to many a time where he or Pokryshkin should've stepped in, should've moved to reign in the excesses of the system. But, the Federation itself was a reaction, a result of the failed idealism of the poets and artists in Tomsk. Perhaps the cynicism which arose in idealism's place was simple yet another inevitable, another result of the Republic's failure.\n\nShukshin looked back up at his compatriot, the Falcon was waiting for an answer, and so he spoke the honest truth."
 PAV_superregional.12.a:0 ""I don't know Pokryshkin, I don't know.""
 
 PAV_superregional.13.t:0 "A Victory for the Silovik State"
 PAV_superregional.13.desc:0 "President Pokryshkin sat behind his desk with a sense of satisfaction. Shukshin and his colleagues had failed. He had been confirmed as the President of the Federation against all of his detractors. The President smiled as he sipped on an aged brandy from his private stock.\n\nThe election had been the death knell of the Federalist cause. Shukshin had been ousted from his position, with his good friend Mikhail Devyatayev taking up the position once occupied by the bleeding heart mayor. With another drink he thought of his next moves. He would have to ensure that the Federalists were completely shut out of power. They would need to be replaced by men loyal to the cause of the Federation, strong men who would provide stability for the state. A return to business as usual was essential, as now that he had been confirmed he would need to consolidate the power of the executive.\n\nLooking out over the city, Alexander took another sip and leaned back in his chair. The election had ensured that the legitimacy of the silovik system had been cemented in the public consciousness. Indeed, the failure of the federalists was the best thing that could have happened for his regime.\n\nAlexander raised his glass to the window and gave a small toast to himself and the Federation."
 PAV_superregional.13.a:0 "A toast to the strong."
 
 PAV_superregional.14.t:0 "New Opportunities"
 PAV_superregional.14.desc:0 "President Alexander Pokryshkin strode into the conference room exuding nothing but the utmost confidence in his position. Already seated were representatives of the big three corporations in the Federation. As he took his seat, he helped himself to the offered drink and practically ignored the other men at the table. When he was ready, he motioned for the men to begin the meeting. "Thank you for joining us, Mr. President. We understand how busy your schedule is and appreciate this meeting," a well groomed man from Sibir began. After the usual pleasantries were observed, business began in earnest.\n\n"Gentlemen, the Federation's recent acquisition of the Russian Far-East has opened up to us a whole new area for profit. What the region lacks in population it more than makes up for in the sheer bounty of natural resources," Pokryshkin began.\n\n"Indeed, the region has a vast potential for the expansion of our operations, and the profits therein. The question, I suppose, must be on the distribution of this vast material wealth. All of our companies have interest in the lands of the Far-East, after all." The Sibir man glared at the representative from Titan as he spoke. In order to head off any argument, the President spoke.\n\n"Gentlemen, as with all of our acquisitions, you shall have a say in the distribution of the land. So long as your financial departments can afford. I believe we shall first speak of the lands around the city of Irkutsk, as they are ripe for exploitation."\n\nThe meeting progressed as smoothly as previous meetings had, and by the end of it the President had made many profitable deals with the men, enough to ensure the economy of the Federation continued to flourish, at least."
 PAV_superregional.14.a:0 "The bounty of the Far East, open at last."
 
 PAV_superregional.15.t:0 "Faded Ideals"
 PAV_superregional.15.desc:0 "President Alexander Pokryshkin sat at his desk late in the night. Frost creeped on the edges of his windows and a great fire roared in the fireplace. He leaned back in his chair after a long day, having only just finished the day's paperwork, and sipped a glass of wine. As he sat there, stewing in his own thoughts, his mind drifted back to better days. He remembered his days flying high in the air over the battle lines, fighting for the glory of Bukharin's Union. He remembered the pride he took in the ideals of the Union, the brotherhood of all its people, and the optimism that had consumed them all in those days.\n\nBefore he could get too invested in the nostalgia, however, he remembered the worst parts of those days. He could remember the despair of the Great Patriotic War, the fear and terror he felt as the Germans just kept pushing no matter what he did. The feelings of despair as he fought a desperate war in the air as his friends and countrymen died on the ground, knowing there was nothing he could that could turn the tide. Most of all he remembered the death of the Union's ideals when the Germans pushed to the AA Line and the union fell.\n\nThe ideals of those days could not last before the onslaught of the fascists. Even in the aftermath, when the Central Siberian Republic was whole and strong, it could not be said that the grand ideals of the past had succeeded. Yet, his ideals had not truly faded until the Federation began its march for a strong Russia.\n\nAlexander shook his head, dismissing the musings of the past. The old days were behind him and thoughts of a free Russia had been dismissed for good reason. What Russia needed was strength and stability at any cost. At his core he knew this to be true."
 PAV_superregional.15.a:0 "To a strong and stable Russia."

 PAV_superregional.16.t:0 "The Music of Machinery"
 PAV_superregional.16.desc:0 "President Alexander Pokryshkin looked upon Novosibirsk from his office and smiled. Before him was a city fit to be the capital of his new Russian Federation. Skyscrapers towered over the city, filled with the new ruling class of Russia: the Oligarchs, the overseers of his new Russia. This truly was the paradise for the Siloviks.\n\nHowever, as Alexander continued to stare from his office down below, he also saw those who benefited the least from his system. Ragged workers walked to and fro towards the factories on the outskirts of the city. Those unemployed could be seen laying about in the streets, begging for money only to be cleared out by the police and forced to go somewhere else other than the upper districts. Memories of Shukshin's cries for a fair and just Russia filled Alexander's mind, which only made him chuckle. That man was a shell, a broken man forced back to the bottle he hated so much for Shukshin and his posse had failed to realize one, singular truth about Russia.\n\nRussia was a harsh nation, and it needed to a strongman to bring it to progress and modernity.\n\nAnd Russia needed to be strong and stable for what was to come. The Germans still had their steely grip on Moscow and Russians suffered under them. They deserved to be a part of Russia, for they are true born Russians, not colonial subjects of a regime of a foreign nation. He would receive what belonged to the Federation back no matter what, no matter the cost.\n\nThe machine of Russia had been broken time and time again, but he had fixed the machine. Now, he orchestrated a symphony of machines, working together for his grand designs for his nation. He couldn't help but smile as he sat down once again in his chair, and toasted the victory to come."
 PAV_superregional.16.a:0 "And so, the music of machinery continues unhindered."

 PAV_superregional.17.t:0 "A Visit to the Ob"
 PAV_superregional.17.desc:0 "The rising sun illuminated the waters of the Ob with a brilliant glow, orange splotches dancing amidst its glimmering waters. They were cleaner now, thanks to new regulations, and he could see several families picnicking along the river's banks.\n\nShukshin allowed himself a small drink as he took in the sight, remembering his excursion to the waterfront nearly a decade ago. Unchecked corporate excess and institutional corruption, a government-run by and for local strongmen. He had changed all that; no longer did corporate greed dictate policy and law, no longer were the working class squeezed for every penny. There was still much to be done, of course, fairer regulations, the issue of Pokryshkin's clique, increased federalization, and the ever-pressing matter of hated Germans.\n\nYet, as he saw workers joking around in the fields just beyond the river and families enjoying a vacation for the first time in years, Shukshin felt something stir inside of him. The idealism which was once so infectious in the early days of the Central Siberian Republic. He was doing this for them, for the people, for Russia, all of Russia, not just those born into power, those blessed by circumstance. He remembered those days, the headiness and optimism, and how everything fell apart under the strain of the Siberian War, and the fighting against the Anarchists, the food riots, the shootings.\n\nHe poured himself another drink as the morning sun rose high in the sky. The CSR may have fallen under the strain of war, but the Federation-his Federation-was different, stronger, and more robust, yet no less concerned for the welfare of its citizens.\n\nIt was different than the CSR. It had to be."
 PAV_superregional.17.a:0 "Or everything would have been for nothing."

 PAV_superregional.18.t:0 "Broken Idols, Solemn Dreams"
 PAV_superregional.18.desc:0 "Vasily Shukshin sat in his kitchen and nursed a glass of some local ale or another. Already he had drained seven glasses just like it and there was little indication that he would sober up anytime soon. His sobriety had been a personal point of pride for him once, when the drink had nearly consumed him. Now though, with his pride tarnished and hopes crushed before him, he relished the old feeling of drunkenness.\n\nHe had been so close. The elections were his chance to bring some semblance of justice and freedom to a system so abused by the Siloviks. And in the end it had all been for nothing. The deals and promises made to rally support, the hopes and dreams inspired in the people of the Federation were turned to ash with the solidification of Pokryshkin's victory.\n\nThe bastard had been quick to remove him from his position, to neuter any hope that he might use his power for the benefit of the people. Instead, one of the President's lackeys held his position to be a yes man for the Silovik regime. It sickened him, the whole rotten situation made him want to puke. The idea that everything he had done throughout his career, for the good of his people, would be wiped away by that smug bastard in Novosibirsk. Vasily clenched his eyes shut as tears threatened to break free.\n\nHis resistance was futile in the end as Vasily Shukshin, last hope for the freedom of the people of the Federation sobbed drunkenly in his kitchen. The tears only stopped long enough for him to pour another glass of alcohol before they started again."

 ### Research and Development events ###
 PAV_rnd.7.t:0 "Project BICHEVATEL - Success"
 PAV_rnd.7.d:0 "The final round of test flights for the MiG-23 concluded yesterday and the results could not be clearer. Project BICHEVATEL has produced the most advanced fighter design to ever come out of Russia, and one of the most advanced fighters in the world, ready to duel any of its counterparts from America, Germany, and Japan, and more than up to the task of finishing off the paltry air forces of our domestic rivals.\n\nWe will not truly know how well the MiG-23 performs in live combat until it is tested in the field, but every simulated combat has shown it is capable of running circles around its opponents. The variable geometry of its wings allows the pilot to adjust between speed and maneuverability as needed, and the advanced radar system and air-to-air missiles have given the fighter a truly unprecedented striking range, capable of hitting enemies over the horizon and beyond the pilot's line of sight. With a fleet of these planes, we will soon be fielding one of the most advanced air forces in the world."
 PAV_rnd.7.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 PAV_rnd.8.t:0 "Project BICHEVATEL - Partial Success"
 PAV_rnd.8.d:0 "The final round of test flights for the MiG-23 concluded yesterday and the results are mostly positive. The MiG-23 is unquestionably an advanced fighter, on par with those fielded by America, Germany, and Japan, but the new technologies it sports are less desirable than we would prefer, and it will take further tests and development to fully work them out.\n\nWe will not truly know how well the MiG-23 performs in live combat until it is tested in the field, but the simulated combats it has been through reveal a plane with a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. The variable geometry of its wings allows the pilot to adjust between speed and maneuverability as needed, but on several occasions the wings locked up mid-flight, forcing the pilot to fly in sub-optimal conditions until they could land for repairs. The advanced radar system has given the fighter an excellent striking range, capable of hitting enemies over the horizon, but the onboard tracking in the missiles malfunctioned frequently, making their extended range often useless. The MiG-23 is unquestionably a great step forward for Russian air power, but it has many kinks that must be worked out before it can go toe-to-toe with its global counterparts."
 PAV_rnd.8.a:0 "Progress, nonetheless."
 
 PAV_rnd.9.t:0 "Project BERKUT - Success"
 PAV_rnd.9.d:0 "Following a series of successful field tests, it has been determined that the S-25 missile system is ready for deployment, and the first anti-air installation is nearing completion on the outskirts of Novosibirsk. Testing showed the new missile to be far better at locking onto and tracking targets, and an improved ability to adjust course mid-flight, resulting in a greater number of simulated hits. Additionally, improvements to missile speed have greatly expanded the response time of anti-air emplacements while the extended range has allowed them to project a much wider zone of control in the skies over our cities.\n\nThough Novosibirsk was never reached by the terror bombing that plagued the lands to our west, our people still lived in constant fear of the day dark planes filled our skies and bombs blotted out the sun. We shall fear no longer, for if any enemy plane tries to approach our people, they shall be answered with swift and deadly vengeance. Russia's sky belongs to no one but us."
 PAV_rnd.9.a:0 "Let them come."
 
 PAV_rnd.10.t:0 "Project PROYDOKHA - Success"
 PAV_rnd.10.d:0 "As western Russia can attest to, there is nothing more effective at destroying a nation's industry and demoralizing its people than systemic strategic bombing. For years our air force and those of the other warlords have been almost totally defensive in nature, more focused on beating back air raids than launching our own. This is finally beginning to change.\n\nEarly tests have shown that the M-50 is an extremely promising candidate as a next generation strategic bomber. Its four engines allow it to move at high speeds for an aircraft of its size and it is able to achieve extremely high altitudes, making it a difficult target for all but the heaviest anti-aircraft systems to hit. Even at high altitudes it is able to deliver its bomb load with extreme precision, comparable to the accuracy of the best bombers in the German air fleet. With the proper training and escorts, a squadron of these planes could rain hell on our enemies and escape without a scratch. When the time comes to reclaim the west from Germany, the M-50 will have what it takes to make the Germans regret thinking they could bomb us with impunity all those years ago."
 PAV_rnd.10.a:0 "They will learn to fear the skies"
 
 PAV_rnd.11.t:0 "Project PROYDOKHA - Inconclusive"
 PAV_rnd.11.d:0 "It is impossible to learn without making mistakes. That is what our engineers have told us after the first series of test runs for the M-50 prototype have exposed several major design flaws. Due to the bulk of the plane, additional engines had to be incorporated into the design to allow it to reach its target speed. The additional bulk of the engine reduced the plane's aerodynamic profile, making it less maneuverable and more vulnerable to interceptor aircraft. Additional issues with the bomb deployment mechanism made accurate targeting highly difficult.\n\nDespite the multitude of problems that have rendered the M-50 an unusable design, our engineers have managed to salvage some of the more innovative ideas incorporated into the prototype. The tests proved that the concept of high-altitude strategic bombing is both possible and achievable with an improved design, and with better engines it should be possible to produce a strategic bomber that is capable of achieving high speeds without issue. That bomber just won't be the M-50."
 PAV_rnd.11.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
 
 PAV_rnd.12.t:0 "Project PROYDOKHA - Failure"
 PAV_rnd.12.d:0 "Hopes were high when the prototype of the M-50 strategic bomber took to the air on its first test run. The development had been a long, difficult process from the very beginning. Issues in the first design were spotted and had to be corrected, then extra weight had to be accounted for. Several air frames had been built and disposed of after more issues were spotted. In the end, after months of stress and work by dozens of engineers and designers, the project had spent almost twice its original budget before a prototype was completed and ready to fly. It would all be worth it as long as the test was successful.\n\nAs the bomber climbed into the sky the men collected in the control tower watched nervously. The pilot read off readings at predetermined intervals, rattling off his air speed, temperature inside the cabin, fuel burn rate, and more. Everything seemed to be going well. One engineer breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThe left wing started to visibly wobble. The pilot reported the plane was beginning to turn and shake outside of his control. The captain in the control tower grabbed the microphone and began to rattle off instructions when they all watched the wing tear off completely. The pilot ejected; a black speck held aloft by a white piece of canvas. Below him the prototype spiralled down to the earth, colliding in a fiery explosion.\n\nThe captain slumped back into his chair and muttered two words."
 PAV_rnd.12.a:0 "Well shit."
 
 PAV_rnd.13.t:0 "Project LETUCHAYA LISITSA - Success"
 PAV_rnd.13.d:0 "Through a combination of ingenuity, determination, and genius, our designers have managed to produce a truly revolutionary combat aircraft. The MiG-25 prototype has recently completed its final round of testing and to say the results are remarkable would be an understatement. The MiG-25 has demonstrated an operational speed of Mach 2.83 and a maximum speed of Mach 3.6, making it one of the fastest combat aircraft ever designed.\n\nWith our pilots able to achieve such high speeds, any attempt to penetrate our airspace will be quickly answered by a flurry of interceptor aircraft able to outpace anything the enemy could throw at us. For the first time in decades, Russian aircraft designers have not only managed to equal the works of their foreign counterparts, they have surpassed them entirely."
 PAV_rnd.13.a:0 "The first time of many."
 
 PAV_rnd.14.t:0 "Project LETUCHAYA LISITSA - Partial Success"
 PAV_rnd.14.d:0 "Through a combination of ingenuity and determination our designers have managed to produce a modern, capable combat aircraft. The MiG-25 prototype has recently completed its final round of testing and the results have been good, but the prototype has fallen short in several areas. The MiG-25 has demonstrated an operational speed of Mach 2.83 and a maximum speed of Mach 3.6, making it one of the fastest combat aircraft ever designed. However, it is unusually heavy for an interceptor aircraft, and its weight has necessitated unusually large wings for a plane of its class.\n\nOur pilots have shown an ability to fight effectively at the MiG-25's high speeds, but they have noted that the plane is less maneuverable than they would prefer. The design still has several issues to be resolved but the MiG-25 will soon be fully ready for production and deployment, and once it takes to the skies it will be able to stand against any air force in the world."
 PAV_rnd.14.a:0 "Better late than never."
 
 PAV_rnd.15.t:0 "Project KROKODIL - Success"
 PAV_rnd.15.d:0 "It is an exciting day for everyone in the Russian armed forces. Yesterday it was announced that a new prototype design for a modern attack helicopter, codenamed KROKODIL, was nearing the end of testing and would soon begin mass production and deployment. The army was especially excited, as it is usually the air force and not them who receives the fancy new toys. The new gunship, officially designated as the Mi-24, will be used in close conjunction with our land forces though, and the generals are practically salivating at the thought of a new mobile fire platform.\n\nSporting multiple machine gun turrets, an arsenal of air-to-surface missiles, and even a limited troop transport compartment, the Mi-24 is considered one of the most advanced dedicated attack helicopters in the world and it is already attracting foreign attention, with reports of interest from the American and Japanese militaries reaching our desks recently. Once the Mi-24 is deployed in large numbers our troops will never have to worry about going without air support again."
 PAV_rnd.15.a:0 "Give the designers a raise."
 
 PAV_rnd.16.t:0 "Project KROKODIL - Partial Success"
 PAV_rnd.16.d:0 "Project KROKODIL has finally produced a working prototype of the Mi-24 and despite several unexpected setbacks, it seems that the design is a very promising one. The design process took longer than expected and ran over budget due to last minute changes to the cockpit to increase damage resistance, but early testing shows that the Mi-24 is capable of providing an impressive amount of supporting fire on demand.\n\nThe prototype is slower than most modern attack helicopters, sacrificing speed and maneuverability to carry more weapons. To offset this disadvantage, it is heavily armored, leading some of the test pilots to dub it the flying tank." As opposed to the rapid strike tactics of most attack helicopters, the Mi-24's pilots have been encouraged to adopt a new strategy of aggressive, prolonged engagements with ground forces, relying on their heavy weaponry to mow down enemy soldiers and vehicles alike while their armor soaks up any incoming fire."
 PAV_rnd.16.a:0 "Time for an aerial blitz."
 
 PAV_rnd.17.t:0 "Project ABAKAN - Success"
 PAV_rnd.17.d:0 "The TKB-011 assault rifle has passed its field tests and is now officially ready to begin mass production. Initial concerns about the rifle's lightweight construction being too fragile for combat have been dispelled after the prototype was adjusted to increase durability while keeping the weight low. Riflemen testing the accuracy have found the TKB-011 to be good for engagements at close and medium ranges, though accuracy does become a concern at long ranges. This is not an issue, as the rifle is intended for deployment with our airmobile infantry, who are trained for close quarters firefights rather than long range battles.\n\nThe commanders of our airmobile divisions are already clamoring to receive the first shipments of the new guns. With a dedicated AR designed specifically for helicopter-borne infantry finally available, we are anticipating a significant increase in the combat ability of some of our most elite and specialized troops."
 PAV_rnd.17.a:0 "A soldier is only as good as his gun."
 
 PAV_rnd.18.t:0 "Project ABAKAN - Failure"
 PAV_rnd.18.d:0 "The rifleman marched in to the corporal's office, a look of disappointment on his face.\n\n"The gun's no good."\n\nThe corporal stared at him, confused. "How do you know? You've only been testing it for five minutes."\n\nThe rifleman tossed the gun on the desk between them and pointed at it. "That's how."\n\nThe stock was shattered, the inner mechanisms of the gun clearly visible through the hole. "What the hell did you do to it?" demanded the corporal "run it over with a truck?"\n\n"I dropped it."\n\n"On what?"\n\n"The ground."\n\nThe corporal's look of frustration was replaced with one of fear. "Oh no." he managed to get out. "What about the other one?"\n\n"Skorpovsky's got it on the firing range but it's not looking great. He can shoot a fly off a donkey's ass from a kilometer out but he didn't hit a bullseye with it the whole time I was out there. Like I said, the gun's no good."\n\n"God fucking dammit.""

 PAV_elections.0.t:0 "The Federal Election"
 PAV_elections.0.desc:0 "As the elections for the federation ramp up, it's become clear that despite Alexander Pokryshkin's prior political ascendancy, that he's been challenged to that very ascendancy by none other than Vasily Shukshin, the mayor of Barnaul.\n\nBoth men occupy highly prestigious and very important positions within the federation, but over the years have come to represent two very different currents of thought in regards to the federation itself. Alexander Pokryshkin, the man that "saved the federation from itself" and engineered its highly successful ascent, has campaigned on a platform of economic expansion, national stability, and measured patriotism.\n\nVasily Shukshin, on the other hand, represents the opposition to Pokryshkin's monopoly on power. Comprised of locals from Barnaul, supporters of a liberal democratic federation, and dissenters-turned-traitors from Pokryshkin's camp, Shukshin's platform is focused around political reform and an emphasis of a return to the roots - culturally and politically - especially in regards to remembering the origin of the federation and a distaste for tyranny.\n\nAs each respective political player begins their campaign, only time will tell which of the two will come out on top."

 PAV_elections.1.t:0 "A Writer's Musings"
 PAV_elections.1.desc:0 "Vasily Shukshin was many things, a writer, actor, and poet, a Mayor, and politician. He had climbed his way from the son of peasants in Altay to become the second most powerful man in the Federation, the champion of democracy.\n\nHowever, as he sat at home, waiting for the results to come in, all he could feel was trepidation. Months worth of campaigning, dozens of speeches, rallies, and meetings; weeks of courting Corporate representatives and sympathetic Siloviki had led to this. He had crisscrossed Siberia, from Magadan to Kolpashevo, and now the only thing he could do was wait.\n\nShukshin stared at the bottle of vodka on his desk, resisting the temptation to pour himself a drink. Pokyrshkin and his allies would use every trick in the book to keep themselves in power, and all he could do was hope that the will of the people would be enough.\n\n------------\n\nThe tallys came in agonizingly slowly, Shukshins heart soaring at every positive result and sinking with every poor showing, but they were clear. Putting the bottle aside, Shukshin made preparations to move Novosibirsk.\n\nThe people had spoken, and they wanted Pokryshkin out."

 PAV_elections.2.t:0 "The Outcome"
 PAV_elections.2.desc:0 "The dawn rose over Siberia as its people awoke from their slumber. The farmer, the worker, the housewife, they all knew what this morning meant. For months, the fate of the Siberian Federation had hung in the balance as the federation's current leader, the corporate status quo President Alexander Pokryshkin, has faced off against a challenge by the former mayor of Barnaul, the democratic Vasily Shukshin. They had dueled in the streets, in the farms, in the barracks, in the very hearts and minds of the people. Everyone knew that whoever won this election, it would determine if the Federation remained in its corporate state status quo or if the Federation would turn a new corner into democracy, a concept the Federation lay unfamiliar with.\n\nAnd so, as they gathered around their radios, bought the morning newspapers and even gathered around the few TVs dotted about the country, they waited with bated breath to hear what would happen to their homeland. Every man, woman, and child sat with baited breath as the newscaster began to speak.\n\n"Hello citizens of the Siberian Federation, this is Nikolai Potemkin of Siberian News Now! Today, I am proud to announce that the winner of yesterday's election and the leader of our glorious Federation is...,"\n\n"President Alexander Pokryshkin!"\n\nSilence filled the homes and crowds of the Federation. Only a scant few in the government and the higher echelons of the companies partied at the news. The people knew what this meant: same old same old, and so, the Siberian Federation would remain the brutal, cynical, corporate state that it always had been, for on this day..."
 PAV_elections.2.a:0 "The people of Siberia had shrugged in indifference to their world."

 PAV_elections.3.t:0 "A Meeting with the Military."
 PAV_elections.3.desc:0 "Amet-khan Sultan was surprised by the size of Vasily Shukshin's office. He had imagined the man challenging Pokryshkin for the presidency of the federation would have a corner office with large windows framing an impressive desk, and rows of file cabinets and bookshelves along the walls. Shukshin's workplace was not that. It was not quite a walk-in closet, but it wasn't far off. Shukshin noticed the military man looking around with a puzzled expression and chuckled.\n\n"I know it isn't much, but when you're challenging the incumbent President from within his own government, it isn't a surprise when your accommodations get suddenly downgraded."\n\nSultan nodded. "My current office has a nice view of the river. I suppose I shouldn't get too attached to it in case this meeting becomes public knowledge."\n\nShukshin grinned and nodded. "Speaking of, I have another meeting in a few minutes so let's get down to business. I don't want you to risk that view for nothing."\n\n"Very well," Sultan said, holding out a file he'd held under his arm. "This is a list of officers in the military that I believe might be sympathetic to our cause. Take a look and let me know who you want me to contact."\n\nShukshin opened the file and glanced over the list of names. "Do you trust these men?" he asked.\n\nSultan hesitated before he spoke. "They are all talented and loyal to the Federation. Some I trust more than others, which I mention in the file, but I think all of them are at least potentially persuadable."\n\nShukshin nodded. "Very good. That's all for now, I'll get back to you tomorrow with a list of who I want to contact first."\n\nSultan turned to walk out of the tiny office. There was work to be done."
 PAV_elections.3.a:0 "Time to find out where the military stands."

 PAV_elections.31.t:0 "Expanding the Coalition"
 PAV_elections.31.desc:0 "When Shukshin opened the door to Amet-Khan Sultan's office he found the former ace staring out the window that overlooked the river. Wordlessly, Shukshin walked over to stand beside him. Both men stared out over the winding waterway for a few seconds before Sultan spoke.\n\n"I really will miss this view. I've spent many hours taking it in, thinking about anything or nothing. At least the sacrifice shall not have been in vain."\n\nShukshin glanced over at him, curiously.\n\nSultan continued. "I've found fifteen other officers who are willing to endorse you publicly. Most are from the army but a few are from the air force and we even got one promising candidate from the naval academy. Now eight of them, including the ones from the air force, are only willing to endorse as a group. Strength in numbers I suppose, but an endorsement is an endorsement. This should be enough to show the people that the military isn't one hundred percent behind Pokryshkin, and it'll help with you being criticized for being too weak on foreign policy."\n\nShukshin grinned. "Fifteen" he murmured. "I thought we'd be lucky to get ten."\n\n"The army is tired of playing second fiddle to the air force" Sultan replied "And the air force wants to hedge its bets in case you win."\n\nShukshin nodded. "Thank you, Amet-Khan. You've done better than I ever could have hoped. If I win you can have whatever office you'd like."\n\nSultan turned his eyes back to the river, a small smile on his face."
 PAV_elections.31.a:0 ""This one will do just fine, sir.""

 PAV_elections.32.t:0 "Progress Rebuked"
 PAV_elections.32.desc:0 "Shukshin waited for the phone on his desk to ring. He had been waiting for half an hour, performing meaningless tasks to keep himself occupied while his eyes continued to drift over to the phone. It had been a long day, and a long night too, but the phone call he was waiting for would determine whether he went to bed pleased or disappointed. He had ruled out going to sleep before the call. Even if it wasn't unprofessional, his nerves would not have let him.\n\nSuddenly the phone clattered to life, and despite the long wait it still caught Shukshin by surprise. He hurriedly picked it up and said one word. "Sultan"\n\n"Mr Shukshin" Amat-Khan Sultan replied from the other end. "I apologize for the delay. I was trying to work something out at the last minute before I called." His tone was professional, but there was a hint of disappointment in his voice it couldn't fully cover.\n\n"I take it you didn't get anyone then." Shukshin sighed.\n\n"Worse, I got an influential army captain by the name of Pokroskov. He and several of his comrades were ready to endorse you but he made too much noise and was found out. He was discharged and replaced within the hour and now no one will even speak to me, not if it puts their careers on the line."\n\nShukshin couldn't hold back the long sigh that followed. "That's... disappointing. Thank you for your efforts Sultan, I know you did your best and things got out of hand."\n\n"I appreciate that, sir." Sultan replied. "I will keep trying and I am still willing to endorse you, but I'd advise your future campaign strategies not rely on any support from the military. Good night."\n\nThe line went dead. Shukshin put the phone back where it sat and rubbed his temples."
 PAV_elections.32.a:0 "He did not sleep well that night."

 PAV_elections.4.t:0 "The Barnaul Rally"
 PAV_elections.4.desc:0 "On a normal night, the Barnaul Theater would be hosting a local musician or an amateur dramatic company debuting a new production, and it would draw a decent audience of the residents of the city whose name the theater bore. But this was no normal night. The main event was not scheduled to start for two more hours and there were already lines around the block. As soon as the doors opened people excitedly filed in, taking any seat they could find. Within half an hour of opening its doors, the Barnaul had to close them again. For the first time in decades, every seat in the house was full. Even the standing room in the back was packed solid.\n\nThe excited chattering of the audience suddenly quieted as the lights winked, then dimmed, a sign that things were about to begin. From backstage Vasily Shukshin took one last deep breath, patted the speech in his pocket, and walked out into the light. The silent theater immediately roared back to life, all 2,500 people there clapping and cheering for him before he'd even said a word. As he took the podium, he couldn't help but grin like an idiot. "Thank you, Barnaul!" he said, the speakers allowing him to make himself heard over the clamor.\n\nThe speech was supposed to last thirty minutes but with the audience cheering and chanting it stretched to almost an hour. Additional speakers outside the theater delivered Shukshin's words to the even larger crowd outside on the streets. The next morning the headline in every major newspaper in the federation was about Shukshin's rally. Most touted it as a huge victory, a massive sign of enthusiasm for the opposition candidate. Even papers loyal to Pokryshkin couldn't help but acknowledge that the rally had been a success for his opponent."
 PAV_elections.4.a:0 "We will need a bigger venue next time!"

 PAV_elections.5.t:0 "Dirty Work"
 PAV_elections.5.desc:0 "Dmitry Glinka read over the memo he'd just received. It came straight from Pokryshkin, and stamped across the top in bold red letters were the words TOP SECRET. Very subtle, Glinka thought to himself. He'd been expecting this memo, or one like it, for quite a while. Pokryshkin was in a reelection campaign and according to the polls it was closer than anyone suspected it could have been at the start of the race. If the boss wanted to be certain of victory, he would have to stop playing nice and get down in the mud, or at least send someone in for him. It seemed that responsibility had fallen on the SB. It made sense that it would. After all, dirty work was what they did best.\n\nGlinka was surprised by the plain wording of the letter. He was used to politicians beating around the bush and trying to maintain a degree of plausible deniability when asking for his help. Pokryshkin had made no such effort here, meaning he was either braver, dumber, or more desperate that Glika had assumed. The order said plainly that the SB was to investigate the leading figures of the opposition and find any secrets from their past they might be trying to conceal from voters. Even more plainly, it said that if the SB could not find sufficient evidence of any scandals, it was authorized to fabricate some in order to "Preserve the stability of the federation."\n\nGlinka chuckled. He'd already dug into Shukshin and most of his cronies, and they were all as clean as a whistle. If only he'd been working for them, he would have had no trouble at all bringing Pokryshkin's corruption to light, but that was not the way things had worked out, was it? The president was the one who paid him, and it was time to earn his keep. Shukshin was running to the left of Pokryshkin on several major issues. That was as good a place to start as any."
 PAV_elections.5.a:0 "Perhaps his campaign has been infiltrated by communist agitators?"

 PAV_elections.51.t:0 "Truth is Relative"
 PAV_elections.51.desc:0 "SHUKSHIN ACCUSED OF WORKING WITH COMMUNIST AGENTS!\n\nA NEW RED MENACE FOR RUSSIA?\n\nOPPOSITION CAMPAIGN MANAGER ARRESTED!\n\nIgor looked over the newspapers, trying to decide which one he wanted. He usually preferred the Morning Post, but recently it had appointed a new editor and had been slowly becoming a mouthpiece for Pokryshkin's government. Not that that mattered today. Every paper, even the ones that were usually anti-government, was carrying a story about Shukshin speaking to some socialist labor leaders last week or about his campaign manager benign arrested yesterday. Igor was already caught up on the communist story so he grabbed the paper with the article on the campaign manager, paid the vendor, and took a seat at a bench.\n\nThe article detailed the arrest and charging of the campaign manager. Apparently, he'd been caught involved in some corrupt dealings trying to rig vote collection in a precinct near Tomsk. He'd already been released on bail but his trial was scheduled for only a week before an election and the newspaper speculated that he would probably be replaced in the coming days. Shukshin, for his part, denied all of the charges and accused the government of fabricating the evidence to disrupt his election bid. Igor was surprised by that. Sure, everyone knew the government was corrupt, but it wouldn't go as far as to just make up evidence would it?\n\nIgor put the paper away and sighed. He didn't normally follow politics, but he had recently. He used to think every politician was just a corrupt, dishonest man looking to make his money off the work of the common people, but Shukshin had made him reconsider that belief. He'd sounded like he genuinely wanted to help in his speeches and writings, but it seemed that he and his allies were just as deceitful as the people in charge right now. If that was the case, Igor thought, he would probably just not bother voting this time either. If nothing would change, what was the point?"

 PAV_elections.52.t:0 "Caught Red Handed"
 PAV_elections.52.desc:0 "PRESIDENT ORDERED FRAMING OF SHUKSHIN!\n\nSB CAUGHT STIRRING UP RED SCARE!\n\nPOKRYSHKIN DENIES ALL INVOLVEMENT!\n\nIgor looked over the headlines, considering which paper he wanted. Not that it mattered, they were all telling the same story, the only story anyone was talking about today. A memo supposedly written by President Pokryshkin to the head of the SB had been leaked. No one but the leaker knew how it got out, but now the front page of every newspaper bore the same picture of a note with the words TOP SECRET printed atop it in bright red and bearing the President's signature at the bottom. The contents of the letter were brief but clear. The SB was ordered to go digging into the past of Shukshin and his associates looking for scandals, and to make some up if they couldn't find any real ones.\n\nIgor picked a paper he knew had a cartoonist he liked and settled in to read further. Shukshin was accusing the President of corrupt and tyrannical behavior, and was calling on the people of the federation to turn out and vote to reject this sort of treatment. Pokryshkin, for his part, was denying everything and dismissed the story as a hoax by the opposition to portray him as a dictator. He had refused to comment on the fact that the signature on the letter matched his perfectly, and it appeared to have been printed on notarized paper from his office.\n\nIgor felt himself getting angrier and angrier as he read the story. He'd known Pokryshkin was corrupt, but he never thought he'd stoop as low as trying to frame his opponent. Igor was not normally a political man. He considered most politicians to be liars and thieves regardless of party or position, but the President had gone too far this time. Igor had heard some of Shukshin's speeches, and he'd been interested but he hadn't made up his mind until now. The election was coming soon, and when it arrived, he'd be sure to cast his ballot for the man that deserved to lead Russia, not the one leading it now"
