 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_SABIT_MUKANOV_DESC: "Sabit Mukanov is truly a self-made man, arising from poverty and eventually becoming involved in political, social, and public affairs after the February Revolution. Mukanov's true fame originates from his career as a writer and poet, and many of his works would share the theme of reflecting prerevolutionary Kazakh life and culture from a post-revolutionary standpoint. He would be hailed as one of the greatest writers in post-revolutionary Kazakhstan and one of the fathers of modern Kazakh culture.\n\nAs the war ended and the years passed, Mukanov eventually become a liberal nationalist. His fame and writing would attract disenfranchised Red Army soldiers from around Kazakhstan to join his movement, the movement for a liberal democratic Kazakhstan. Although his republic is small, it is considered by some as a potentially flourishing democracy. While Mukanov is ambitious in his goals, he is beginning to grow old and it is not known if he can even live long enough to see the democratic Kazakhstan that he dreams of."
