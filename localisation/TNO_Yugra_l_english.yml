 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_JABA_IOSELIANI_DESC:0 "Under Bukharin's reign, the Komi Autonomous SSR was dotted with the Gulag system's prison camps, where political dissidents, criminals, and the Soviet Union's other "undesirables" were pressed into harsh labor programs for the state's benefit. Even after the Union fell, the West Russian Revolutionary Front continued the practice, sending trainloads of convicts and prisoners of war to the camps and keeping a close eye on them through the Red Navy base in Vorkuta. It was into this system that Jaba Konstantinovich Ioseliani was sent. A Georgian university dropout who found bank robbery to be a far more lucrative career than academia, Ioseliani was arrested for trying to hold up a train that was evacuating the assets of a Moscow bank. A swift military tribunal found him guilty and threw him in the hold of the first ship headed to Vorkuta. He fell in the with Vory v zakone, the "thieves who make the law" that ran many gulags' criminal networks, and settled into a routine of backbreaking labor that would likely last for decades.\n\nBut as luck would have it, the Soviet Union collapsed several weeks later, and Vorkuta lost its lifeline. The prisoners divided into two groups: those who wanted to work with the guards to survive, and those who refused to break the thieves' code and be "suki." After some brief but bloody skirmishes, the collaborators fled into the Urals and Ioseliani helped organize a grand criminal exodus further inland, far away from the restless jailers of Vorkuta, which greatly improved his standing and got him a seat in the circle of Vory leaders representing their camps. As the West Russian Revolutionary front rose and fell far to the west, Ioseliani grew in influence until he was elected chairman of the circle. He also made several rather lucrative agreements with Dragunov and the arms dealers of Zlatoust, serving as a buffer against the remnants of the West Russians in exchange for arms and weapons. But there are those within the prison hierarchy view Ioseliani's agreement as betrayal of the Vory code, and his lack of ambition for conquest has some whispering about complacence and laziness..."

 POLITICS_IVAN_ISTOMIN_DESC:0 "Ivan Grigoryevich Istomin, a native of Siberia, became the leader of a warlord state in a chaotic nation by mere chance. Being a Nenets with Komi roots, he was a prime example of a true indigenous man, and battled to keep his mother tongue alive. He taught it in schools, later even becoming a writer and spreading his words and ideas to a population ravaged by war, without ever involving himself in actual politics.\n\nLater, with the advent of the Ural Republic as a regional power, a power vacuum formed in certain territories of West Siberia, which the gun merchants of Zlatoust took advantage of by establishing loyal satellites.\n\nIn the far north, a place inhabited by natives, Istomin was found as a relatively popular intellectual, who agreed to take the position of leader of Nenetsia. That way, he may be able to keep the dream of a native, and above all democratic, state alive."
 
 ### Ideas ###
 KOM_selfmade_men:0 "Self-Made Men"
 KOM_selfmade_men_desc:0 "Our governmental apparatus stands unique amongst the ruins of Russia, in that it is staffed mostly by the... entrepreneurs of the Old Motherland. While this may lead to us being seen as a nation of Thieves-in-Law, our leaders' unique career paths may prove useful, not just for negotiation, but for trade as well. Our methods may be crude, but they yield results; and that is all that matters."
 KOM_zlatoust_made_government:0 "Zlatoust-Made Government"
 KOM_zlatoust_made_government_desc:0 "The fact still stands; without our Sister Republic in Zlatoust, we will be nothing more than a leaf in the wind. With their protection, however, we will be able to see to our... unique ventures without fearing foreign disturbances."
 KOM_siberian_democracy:0 "Siberian Democracy"
 KOM_siberian_democracy_desc:0 "With the criminals in charge having been cast down, we have an unique opportunity to create a properly democratic system in these Siberian wastelands. An opportunity that our new leadership does not want to let slip."
 KOM_siberian_faithful:0 "Siberian Faithful"
 KOM_siberian_faithful_desc:0 "The decadent earthly trappings of the Yugra have been cast down at last in favor of the Word of God. Now we have the opportunity to properly show our people the road to their salvation, and then extend this grace to Siberia, the Motherland and beyond."
