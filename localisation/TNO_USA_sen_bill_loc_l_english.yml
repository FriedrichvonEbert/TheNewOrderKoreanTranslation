USA_sen_bill_name_1:0 "Segregated Education Enforcement Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_1:0 "The American Education Separation Act will officially implement a state of segregation for all schools within the United States, North, South, East, and West, bringing an end to those liberal dreams of those progressives that want to ruin the truly patriotic American nation. Tradition must be maintained, and tradition will be maintained, so long as I see fit!"
USA_sen_bill_name_2:0 "The Perth Conference"
USA_sen_bill_desc_2:0 "The Perth Conference is the meeting initiated by the USA, containing nations aligned against the Japanese to fight them through mutual trade with each other rather than dependence on the Japanese. The terms will be negotiated during this meeting and then submitted through Congress, should they fail to pass through Congress, they will have to be renegotiated at a later date."
USA_sen_bill_name_3:0 "은 법안"
USA_sen_bill_desc_3:0 "The Bennett Administration has grown frustrated with America's continuously outdated monetary system causing the economy to stutter and fall. Thus, it is time for America to depart from the Silver based system of currency and move to a much more profitable system: the Gold Value. We look forward to uniting the country under an improved financial system, so long as we manage to get the bill passed through the houses of Congress."

USA_sen_bill.3.t:0 "The Silver Act Fights Through Congress"
USA_sen_bill.3.d:0 "The Bennett administration has worked relentlessly on the scrutinizing reviews regarding the Silver Act. The President has collaborated with a multitude of secretaries within the upper levels of the West Wing to finalize the bill. Vice President Ford has declared that the bill's passage has become "one of the most prioritized plans of the Bennett administration in an effort to aid the American economy."\n\nBennett leads the charge to rouse the Democrats to action, driving them to support his plan to place the American economy into a more stable position by transferring the currency-backed metal to that of gold, which is now far more reliable than industrial silver as a store of value. One of the most important details of the Silver Act would be the repeal of the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, which would level off the focus on silver mining and "promote fiscal responsibility within the government," as quoted by Treasurer Absalom Robertson.\n\nHowever, while the bill appears to be siding towards approval within Congress, there are those within the United States that would seek the bill's failure. Many spurned southern Democrats who have turned to the NPP's Far Right find the bill to be distasteful, hurting current silver miners. Likewise, in an odd coalition, the Center branch of the NPP has outspoken members standing against the bill, claiming that it will hurt American jobs. All that's left is to see whether the bill will survive the battleground of the Congress."
USA_sen_bill.3.a:0 "The Legislative Branch decides our fate now."

bill_3_passed:0 "After gathering on the steps of the Congressional building in Washington D.C. in the early morning, political analysts report that the Silver Act, a bill shepherded by the Bennett Administration through multiple discussions, analyses, and negotiations, has successfully passed in both houses of Congress and is set to be signed into law. The Silver Act's passage proves the potential of the hardworking advisors and officials who managed to construct the piece of legislation after months of hard work within the West Wing, the Treasury, and those outside of D.C.\n\nPresident Bennett himself commented on the bill's passage this evening, declaring it a "crowning achievement of both unity and potential for the United States of America, and a step forward for a new era of economic success." Multiple figures in Bennett's administration, including Treasurer Absalom Robertson, have echoed President Bennett's enthusiasm, stating that "the silver system served to bog the United States down in an outdated system, while the gold system will allow us to continue to show American economic strength worldwide." Republicans and Democrats applauded each other for their bipartisan cooperation towards the bill's success.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, NPP senators and representatives appear rather quiet over the outcome of the Silver Act. While some hail the success of the bill alongside the R-D's, others exchange confused glances over the ease of the bill's passage. For now, however, the United States takes the first steps towards adopting gold to back the dollar."
bill_3_passed.Option:0 "We've done it, everyone."
bill_3_passed.Title:0 "The Silver Act Passes in Congress"
bill_3_failed:0 "We have just been informed that the Silver Act, a thought-to-be unanimous bill built up to be the pride and joy of the Bennett Administration, has died on the Congressional floor. After months of work within the Treasury, and months of planning to finalize attempts to push it through Congress, the bill has failed to make it through a floor vote.\n\nPresident Bennett offered his "sincerest apologies to the citizens of the United States for the extreme partisanship within the federal government." Throughout the Senate and House of Representatives, Republican and Democratic congressmen continuously shake their heads, grimace, and express their frustrations over the Silver Act being defeated by political chicanery. Administration officials stated that "the administration will continue its efforts to aid the American economy, despite the evident political hurdles to even the most basic of tasks."\n\nOn the other hand, NPP congressmen have related surprise over their success on the legislative floor. Far Right and Center NPP congressmen shake hands and congratulate one another in the Capitol, while R-D legislators field angry calls from their voting base. The Democratic branch of the R-D's, in particular, are reeling, with large swathes of former Democratic voters turning to the NPP, even as the Republicans raise questions about the Bennett administration's fitness for office. The administration is scrambling to find a solution to the bill's failure."

USA_sen_bill_name_6:0 "The Federal Student Aid Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_6:0 "Education has been a local issue since the beginning of America, with local school districts maintaining schools and the states providing some direction. However, this has meant that there are wide disparities based on wealth and state mandates, meaning that many students are not receiving the full education they need for the future. The Federal Student Aid Act will fix this, by providing resources to states and districts that desperately need it, and a baseline standard of education across the US."
bill_6_passed:0 "President Robert Kennedy, surrounded by the students and teachers at Strong John Thomson Elementary School in Washington DC just a few blocks from the White House, is signing the Federal Student Aid Act to applause as news cameras and photographers record the event for posterity.\n\n"Today, we say that all of America's students deserve the chance to learn and grow, to become the well-informed, smart and intelligent adults of tomorrow that will make America better than ever. The doctors, teachers, artists, inventors and leaders of tomorrow are in our schools today, and we must do all we can today, to make tomorrow even better."\n\nThe FSA Act will set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government will provide money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the new standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile education groups and civil rights organizations are really pleased with the FSA in their equality and standardization edicts, many state's rights proponents are angry at the law, which is pretty much stripping the local control over education that has long been one of the most important roles of the states. While most of the articles of the law are only for those school districts that require the funds and are "opt-in," the need for money in many of the poorest states will force them to compromise on their beliefs in order to get the money they need to operate. Nevertheless, the FSA will soon make America one of the best educated nations in the world."
bill_6_failed:0 "In a shocking announcement, the Federal Student Aid Act has failed to clear the Senate. Overseeing the vote, Vice President Hubert Humphrey has announced that the act has failed to acquire enough votes, leading to a major blow to his and President Kennedy's effort at school reform.\n\n"The failure of this effort to reform America's schools will reverberate throughout the years," Bobby Kennedy angrily thundered during a press conference. "The next George Washington Carver will never get the chance to see their full potential. The next Ernest Hemmingway will be stuck in poverty. The next Thomas Edison will never get to change the world."\n\nThe FSA Act would have set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government would have provided money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the now tabled law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile state's rights supporters cheer the failure of the "draconian" and "tyrannical" efforts to level the playing field for education across America, Civil Rights groups and education unions decry the failure of the law and the many inequalities that will persist for the indefinite future."

RD_R_compromise_desc_6:0 "Senator Scoop Jackson has been meeting with multiple Republican senators throughout the sprawling Senate Office Buildings, most of them individually in the attempt to get enough votes to pass the Federal Student Aid Act.\n\nIn fact, Scoop has been surprised about how receptive to the idea of additional education funding is with his colleagues from the other side of the aisle. After all, there is nothing more popular with a politician seeking re-election than to point to a new school in their district, or the improved test scores, to show that, yes, they are doing their job.\n\nBut, like usual, there are some concerns with the law as it has been written. For one thing, some Senators have expressed concern about how the federal mandates will strip the states of their prerogatives to manage education, which would be incredibly unpopular in some states, especially in the south and west. Other senators were a bit uneasy on the cost of the FSA, which will tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars to the budget. While, again, they like the idea of supporting education, they also don't want to saddle those same children with even more debt when they become taxpayers.\n\nHaving taken their words into account, Scoop has approached the committee writing the bill, and made his suggestion:"

USA_sen_bill_name_7:0 "The Affordable Housing Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_7:0 "The American dream is centered around one thing: owning your own home. But since the end of the war, real-estate developers have been more focused on developing middle-class suburbia: thousands of cookie-cutter homes on twisting cul-de-sacs far from the centers of the big cities. This has left millions, especially racial minorities, squeezed out of the housing market. The Affordable Housing Act will solve this issue, and build many new homes and the amenities to make new communities."
bill_7_passed:0 "As the signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office to the flash of photographers' light bulbs, an assortment of real estate developers, civil rights leaders and mayors from cities big and small across America applauded as President Robert Kennedy signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.\n\n"I'm pleased to sign this bill into law, which will make it easier to build affordable, liveable, and safe housing for those Americans that could only dream before of home ownership," the President said moments before he signed the law. "Today, we say that every family in the United States has the right to own their own home."\n\nThe new law will allow cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill will also provide subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and help establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city. These new homes would not be apartment blocks like some opponents had suggested, but duplexes, townhouses, row houses and other such buildings to allow more people access to housing that the larger, car focused suburban dwellings that are too expensive, or even forbidden, for racial minorities to access: government funding is only provided on the condition that no barriers will be put in place for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics or anyone else.\n\nAlready, there are many plans being drawn up for the "Kennedyburgs" in every city in the nation, redeveloping areas that had overlooked and abandoned for years, promising a new construction boom that will last for a decade or more."
bill_7_failed:0 "The votes are in, and the Senate has rejected the Affordable Housing Act, one of the key planks of President Robert Kennedy's agenda. Complaints about the cost, the dictates on how the money would be spent, and even lingering segregationist elements in Congress scuttled the law that would have revitalized major cities, opening up housing development for minorities and working class families, and created a whole new chorot of property owners.\n\n"The President is disappointed at the Senate's rejection of the Affordable Housing Act," a spokesman for the White House said in a press conference. "Nevertheless, the fight to expand home ownership and give all Americans, not just the wealthy and middle class, the chance to buy their own house will go on."\n\nThe defeated law would have allowed cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill would have also provided subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and helped to establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city.

RD_R_compromise_desc_7:0 "Going to the Senate cafeteria and seeing the various senators dining is an eye opening experience. Men and women who are diametrically opposed ideologically can be seen chatting and having a good time, while those that are of the same party often can be seen avoiding each other. It's a great way to see who is an introvert, who's an extrovert, and even how the nitty-gritty details of politics can get done.\n\nIn the haze of cigarette smoke and the smell of the meals served hot by some of the best chefs in Washington, "Scoop" Jackson was sitting with some of his Republican colleagues, enjoying their mid-afternoon break.\n\n"So, about the housing bill," one of the Republican Senators said, cutting into a chicken breast. "I can tell that you are here to get that passed, right?"\n\n"Well, if you want to get to business," the Senate Leader of the C-NPP replied. "But you know it will help your communities greatly, make a lot of new homeowners, taxpayers, and all that shit that will make your cities and states happy indeed. And it won't be just Chicago or Seattle or Miami that gets the money. Every city and town in the country can apply for it."\n\n"It's going to cost a lot though," another senator said. "Not sure if my constituents will appreciate having to foot the bill."\n\n"It will pay for itself in time," Jackson replied, as he took a drink of water. "Besides, if you give a man a home, go and cut the ribbon when they open it up, I'm sure lots of folks will support you in your next term." Jackson set his glass on his tray, and stood up, preparing to hand off his dirty dishes and return to work. "You can't get better publicity than that.""

USA_sen_bill_desc_9_minimum_wage:0 "For far too long, industry, business and capital have dictated the terms to their workers: how long they will work, what they will be paid, and what benefits they will receive, and if they will recognize unions or not. While there has been advancement in the past century to make working conditions safer and increased wages, many companies do their best to undermine all these promises. The National Labor Relations Act will fix that: unions are officially recognized and will be supported by the government, a eight hour work day for all industries will be codified, and a national minimum wage will be established."

bill_9_passed_minimum_wage:0 "In one of the biggest changes to American economics in the 20th century, President Bobby Kennedy has signed the sweeping National Labor Relations Act into law. Overnight, the balance of power in the largest economy in the world was shifted, with workers and employees granted unalienable and legal rights that would further balance their position vis à vis their employers.\n\nOne of the NLRA's largest components include the recognition of trade unions, banning employers from firing workers or trying to intimidate and halt anyone who tries to organize any work places, with steep penalties and fines for any company found to have broken this law. Regulations mandating that full-time workers be given an eight hour work day, or at least generous overtime pay is another large component of the NLRA. Penalties will be put in place to prevent companies from trying to get around this, including rules on who is classified as "part-time", a "contractor" or "freelance", and that all categories be given the same or equivalent benefits and rights as full-time employees. One of the most important aspects is the establishment of a federal minimum wage: $1.50 for full-time employees in most industries, with agriculture and a handful of service industries allowed to set a slightly smaller minimum wage to a minimum of $1.10. But this minimum wage would be re-evaluated every year based on inflation, to maintain the purchasing power.\n\n"The only way to maintain a strong economy and a strong democracy is to give everyone in the nation the ability to make a living," President Kennedy said as he signed the law. "To make enough to put food on their table and a roof over the head, to enjoy the fruits of their labor with leisure, and to maintain their dignity and freedom, never to be undermined by the greed and short-sightedness of their bosses."\n\nWhile opposition from business groups, conservatives, anti-unionists, and free market proponents has been intense, and Wall Street has seen a sharp drop in it's value when the bill passed, the NLRA has proven to be popular with the majority of the American workers and voters.

USA_sen_bill_name_15:0 "Power to the States Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_15:0 "Education has long been the purview of the states and local governments, with no federal oversight or control except for some funding. But in the past decades, the Federal government has attempted to force the states to accept top-down dictates on how and what to teach. The Power to the States Bill will prevent this. It's the individual state's job to determine what and how they teach, and we will get out of their way to do it."
bill_15_passed:0 "President Margaret Chase Smith today has signed the "Power to the States" Act into federal law, having passed through Congress last night after a midnight vote. The President addressed reporters in a press briefing after signing the law, stating that "...it is not the job of the federal government to mandate a one-size-fits-all approach to education in the fifty states of the nation. Each state, county and city knows what is best for them."\n\nThis law curtails the use of the federal budget to provide funds to schools to mandate certain requirements, such as required courses, class sizes, and the composition of those classes. This would effectively allow various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South.\n\nThe controversial law is a victory for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Party, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. However, opposition has been pronounced from civil rights activists as backsliding, and also from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states. But the law has passed, and a new normal for teaching will soon come to America."

This would have effectively allowed various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South. But this effort to turn back the clock on civil rights has failed.\n\nThe defeat of controversial law is a major blow for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Party, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. The opposition from civil rights activists, and from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states, was enough to convince a majority of senators to not go ahead.

USA_sen_bill_desc_16:0 "The Statue of Liberty says "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." Sadly, many may breathe free in America, but they die tired and poor regardless. It is unconscionable that so many Americans must suffer from want in a land of plenty, at the whim of 'market forces' - the predations of a bourgeois elite who care more for money than for dignity. Where individual states and capitalists will not act, the Federal government will intervene to provide comprehensive unemployment benefits and job support. This is the great calling of our times - the Crusade for the Common Man.\n\nWallace and the §gsegregationists§! in the NPP may have other ideas... but §Pthey don't matter§! anymore."
bill_16_passed:0 "Sally McDougal nervously eyed around the nondescript conference room in Washington D.C. and its occupants, feeling well out of her depth. The social worker from Newark had been one of many to respond to the Smith Administration's call for new administrators in the federal bureaucracy, responsible for implementing the Federal Poverty Act and the Crusade for the Common Man.\n\nNow, surrounded by both earnest, but untested civil servants and the jaded, but experienced mandarins of Washington, she couldn't help but wonder if this was actually going to work.\n\nA screech of a microphone brought everyone to attention, as a greying gentleman, the Director, stepped up to the podium. "Ladies, gentlemen," he began. "I'm sure many of you have questions our mission to implement the Federal Poverty Act. Many of you will wonder if there is a plan, some kind of template for our work."\n\n"I will be honest. There is no template, no plan, no prior precedent." The Director surveyed the room, as Sally's eyes widened. "The coming days will be difficult, so I want you all to remember this. We are the vanguard of America's most ambitious social experiment, to grab the problem of poverty by the horns and to bring it to heel, with all the passion and wisdom at our disposal.""

Who could have imagined that President Smith, up until yesterday so confident in the prospects of the most ambitious social project of the 20th Century, would now be delivering a halting address to the nation about her failure to overcome the opposition?\n\nThe government had even begun posting applications for new positions in the federal bureaucracy, and Sally (as many others) had dropped everything for the promise of doing good for their fellow Americans. Now, none of that would happen; the job postings would be removed, resumes shredded, interviews canceled.

USA_sen_bill_desc_17:0 "Progressive and conservative elements of the National Progressive Party have always disagreed over the implementation of welfare programs. The Far-Right wing of the party, in particular, has been outspoken against welfare. Now, due to the poor nature of the South, whence much of the Far-Right draws its support, a compromise is possible. With Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP working together, the new National Welfare Act would allow economic opportunity to millions of Americans, particularly in the South."
bill_17_passed:0 "After being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the National Welfare Act was passed in the Senate today and is soon to be signed into law by President Margaret Chase Smith. Winning an easy majority from both the National Progressive Party and the Republican-Democrats, it appears to have had a much broader base of support than was initially thought. Most happy at the news were the bill's main proponents: Senator Michael Harrington and Governor George Wallace, who came to a compromise on their differing views on welfare to create something that worked for both parties.\n\nAs soon as it is signed into law, millions of poor Americans -many of them from the poverty-stricken, rural South- will now be able to apply for government financial assistance. The bill's success has shown much of America that the National Progressive Party is truly capable of working together as a united political group on more than just foreign policy. It has also greatly strengthened the position of President Margaret Chase Smith, who stands to see a great uptick in her approval ratings."
bill_17_failed:0 "After a period of being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the results are in: the National Welfare Act died in the Senate. There was no dramatic filibuster from the Republican Democrats, nor a surprising change of allegiances that swept the vote; rather, there simply was not enough political support behind the bill. Senator Michael Harrington, who was one of the bill's main supporters, called the result "unfortunate".\n\nThe bill was heavily anticipated as the first instance of true cooperation in the National Progressive Party over welfare programs. Vocally supported by Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP, it found good ground in the House and quickly made its way to the Senate. Once there, however, it stalled, died, and left millions of poor Americans without hope for government aid.\n\nThe loss of the bill in the Senate has definitely weakened the position of the President Margaret Chase Smith, as well as humiliated the extremely vocal supporters of it found in Senator Harrington and Governor Wallace. While they will likely recover their reputations, it seems unlikely that welfare legislation will be passing through Congress anytime soon."

# Harrington Bills

USA_sen_bill_name_20:0 "Elementary and Secondary Education Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_20:0 "Perhaps the well-being of a nation can best be measured by how its children are treated. If so, in America, that well-being is woeful at best for the poor and marginalized. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act seeks to address that issue. ESEA will provide substantially more funding to public schools, but the Act goes far beyond that. It also expands after-school programs, makes free breakfasts and lunches widely accessible and free of potential stigma, and, perhaps most radically, gives subsidies and tax breaks to poor parents who can verify their childrens' public school attendance. This suite of policies would improve grades, attendance, mental health, and basic childhood nutrition for millions of American children, in urban and rural areas alike."
USA_sen_bill_name_21:0 "Federal Healthcare Regulations Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_21:0 "American healthcare is, like so many other things in this country, a massive enterprise. It's also an unequal one. Our hospitals are the envy of the world, yes, but millions of Americans don't have adequate insurance, if they have it at all. This burden falls especially hard on the poor and elderly. The Federal Healthcare Regulations Act will set minimum standards for all private insurers, requiring that they cover a variety of out-of-pocket expenses, non-hospital fees, and primary care, in contrast to the hospital-based business models we've seen before. HMOs may protest, and healthcare-providing business owners may balk, but it's a small price to pay for a healthier, more secure society."
USA_sen_bill_name_22:0 "The Food Stamps Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_22:0 "It is time to address one of the most fundamental problems within our Nation, the clawing hunger that pervades our lower classes. This new bill will begin handing out special stamps to our poor, these stamps can be used to purchase food. Passing this bill will hopefully allow us to put our agricultural surplus into the hands of those who need it most. Such "handouts" are unlikely to be popular with much of Congress, as such, we need to begin building support for our bill."
USA_sen_bill_name_23:0 "The Hunger Bill"
USA_sen_bill_desc_23:0 "Right now, there are people starving within our cities. Thousands sleep on the streets, unable to find shelter. Mothers desperately try to secure nourishment for their children. This injustice can not be allowed to go on any further. They may be impoverished, but they are our people, and they must be protected. Harrington's Hunger Bill seeks to begin mitigating these problems, and if possible, end them entirely."

USA_HAR_social_security_act_desc:0 "Every American deserves to live a decent life, and yet, so many our citizens fall into poverty. This act will construct a safety net, to ensure that in times of need, our people can stay afloat. Unfortunately, this act is going to be quite expensive. We will have to determine an appropriate avenue of funding in order to guarantee this bill's success."
USA_HAR_economic_equality_act_desc:0 "The Workers of America has been mistreated by the greedy for far too long. In addition to providing economic security, our bill will begin to address the many problems of the worker. We will guarantee a high federal minimum wage, as well as implement a 6 hour workday. These measures are seen as radical by the majority of Congress, we are going to need to build a large amount of support if this bill has any chance of passing. If we are able to move mountains and get this bill passed, we will finally give our workers the rights that they deserve."
USA_sen_bill_name_25:0 "The Higher Education Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_25:0 "For all that the media harps on about long-haired draft dodgers and "women's libbers", higher education plays a vital role in the social and economic health of the nation. It produces our teachers, our doctors, our future leaders, and countless varieties of tradespeople. It's also not exactly cheap. The Higher Education Act seeks to fix that. It lowers costs for public colleges and universities that receive federal money, and provides additional subsidies to expand the student body. This will make it easier for poor and working-class students to get ahead in life. Of course, it's encountering opposition from dyed-in-the-wool conservatives and ostensibly progressive liberals alike, who claim that it will upend the order of things. To which the Harrington administration might respond, "It's about time.""
USA_sen_bill_name_26:0 "Affirmative Action Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_26:0 "One of the largest factors in the continuation of America's racial inequities has been lack of access. This can include access to employment, to promotion, to higher education, and so forth. Such a lack of access keeps families locked in a permanent cycle of poverty, keeping them from building wealth and improving their personal lot in life. And such a lack of access almost always falls on American minorities.\n\nThe Harrington administration is proposing the Affirmative Action Act, a plan to address these inequities directly. It will establish new hiring guidelines for federal contractors, give preferential support to minority-owned businesses, and implement quota systems to ensure that public colleges give more opportunities to the underserved. The GAO has estimated that such a plan, if implemented, would raise millions of peoples' incomes over the next twenty years. In addition, their report finds that the AAA has the potential to drastically improve standards of living in numerous communities across the country, and would measurably reduce the racial wealth gap."
USA_sen_bill_name_27:0 "Medical Care Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_27:0 "Insurance can be a good thing to have in a pinch, but regardless of how much it covers, if it leaves one destitute, it isn't much good. That's the case for millions of Americans, who are driven to bankruptcy, or just can't afford insurance in the first place. The Medical Care Act, or Medicare, would change that. It would create a government insurance program that citizens could voluntarily sign up for, if they met certain income criteria. Such a program would cover any and all prescription, primary care, and hospital needs. Medicare could serve as the foundation for a truly universal American healthcare system. But the potential costs, paid through income taxes, have raised more than a few eyebrows in Middle America."
USA_sen_bill_name_28:0 "The Veterans Service Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_28:0 "Harrington will start his program to remake America with a softball: by legislating in benefits for America's weary heroes, the serviceman who sacrifice life and limb in the defense of liberty. Nobody will object to the nation rewarding those who served it so bravely overseas - from educational benefits to expanded healthcare access, all of America can agree that its warriors deserve a home fit for heroes."

# Goldwater Bills

USA_sen_bill_name_30:0 "Goldwater's New Budget!"
USA_sen_bill_desc_30:0 "President Goldwater's proposed budget bill would drastically cut welfare and social security spending, and instead focus on debt reduction and paving the way for the free market. While the budget would provide the foundation for Goldwater's domestic policy if it were to be accepted by Congress, it is rather unpopular at the moment. The administration would need to reach out if it wants its bill to have any chance of passing."
bill_30_passed:0 "In what is sure to be a landmark moment for President Goldwater's administration, the proposed budget has been accepted by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Initially highly unpopular and still polarising even now, extensive lobbying has managed to secure the support necessary for the bill being passed.\n\nThe bill, which includes the slashing of welfare and social security budgets, has paved the way for the president's broader economic and fiscal agenda. While it is uncertain how this budgetary reorientation is going to impact the American economy in the long run, analysts have been cautiously optimistic. The Goldwater administration meanwhile, is overjoyed at this major political victory. It is likely the administration will want to capitalise on the momentum the passing of the budget has generated, and more proposals are expected to follow.\n\nAs could have been expected however, the adoption of the budget has unfortunately widened the divisions within the Republicans-Democrats. Many Republicans have expressed their deep opposition to the president's fiscal agenda. Consequently, many of them now feel tempted to flock into the welcoming and eager arms of the Center-NPP. How this will affect the stability of the coalition will remain to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, it is a major victory for the White House and Secretary Don Regan in particular, whose fiscal philosophy, dubbed "Reganomics", has been the cornerstone of the bill. This victory is a momentous occasion which is undoubtedly to lead to the popping of champagne bottles in the oval office. Certainly, the president can sleep a little easier knowing this battle has been won."
bill_30_failed:0 "In a bitter defeat for President Goldwater's, the budget bill his administration has proposed some weeks ago has been rejected by congress. Having been unpopular from the start, the bill's defeat has come as no surprise to many. Still, the administration had made every effort to garner enough political support to see the bill passed. It now seems however, that these efforts were to no avail, as the bill lies dead on the floor of congress.\n\nWith the rejection of the president's budget, the flagship of the White House's economic and fiscal agenda has been sunk. Weeks of hard work have been undone in a single stroke and it seems ever more uncertain if President Goldwater will be able to push the other elements of his fiscal and economic agenda through congress. For now, the new administration's efforts have been stopped dead in their tracks. Reportedly the cabinet is currently convening in a room in the West Wing on how to proceed from here on out. Secretary Don Regan, whose fiscal philosophy has been a central component of the bill, seems particularly infuriated at the news of the bill's defeat.\n\nOpponents of the bill have been overjoyed however, with the Republican half of the Republicans-Democrats having found cause to celebrate. How this will affect the Democrats' position is uncertain, although this legislative defeat has certainly shown their weakness. In any case, it is a serious blow to the president's agenda. The White House will have to find a way to regain the initiative."

Opposite of him, Senator Richard Russel Jr, representing his faction of the NPP.\n\n"Mister President-" Russel began. "-I've looked at your bill in detail, and I am convinced it can be salvaged." Goldwater knew exactly what "salvaged" meant here. He had no illusions who he was dealing with, and what sort of price Russel would ask in exchange for cooperation. It was why the president had invited him here today, hoping that Russel's demands wouldn't be too outrageous. On the other side of the table Senator Russel looked at him with appraising eyes. The Georgian senator too, knew perfectly well who he was dealing with. Goldwater was many things, but committed on the issue of civil rights he was not. Russel was well aware of the president's ambivalence on the matter. Such ambivalence might be an opening for Russel's own political agenda, so he thought to himself. If the president was willing to budge here, Russel would be able to budge on the topic of finance.\n\n"It seems to us that your budget proposal entails a significant reduction in spending, freeing up a significant amount of federal funds." the president could already guess where Russel was going with this. "Perhaps it is time some of these funds made their way back to the south.'" Russel leaned forward on the table, closing the physical distance between him and the president. "We'd be willing to lend you the votes you need, Mr. President." "If room can be made in the bill to send some of the available funds to Southern schools."\n\nRussel paused briefly.\n\n"White schools, naturally.""

Rarely the occasional aide briefly interrupted as they entered to refill the two state men's coffee cups. Through the windows they could see the sun make its daily retreat beyond the horizon, giving way to the night.\n\nGoldwater sat not behind his desk, but opposite of Rockefeller on one of the couches with a coffee table in between them. Despite Rockefeller being Goldwater's vice-president, the inner politics of the Republicans-Democrats had complicated their working relationship significantly. Indeed, many times Rockefeller had been a vocal critic of the president's proposed course.\n\nOn the coffee table before them laid an assortment of papers. They were parts of the proposed budget bill, with certain clauses underlined or stricken with a pen: the result of three hours of back-and-forth between the two men.\n\n"I'm asking you to put the party first, Barry." it was the first time Rockefeller had addressed the president by his first name. It took Goldwater by surprise, but there was no hint of disrespect in Rockefeller's voice. "If we agree on this, you'll get your budget, and we'll keep the party intact."\n\nGoldwater leaned back on his couch, thinking to himself. In the back of his head he still heard the ringing of secretary Regan's urgings not to compromise. Yet the deal Rockefeller offered was a tempting bargain. If he was willing to slow down just a little bit and water down the budget bill, his vice-president would make sure the Democrats would support it. Rockefeller leaned forward and clasped his hands together as he awaited the president's reply.\n\n"Nelson, here's where I stand.""

The administration's effort to put a cap on the debt ceiling, the 'financial responsibility and erasure of debt' bill, has gained the requisite amount of votes to be accepted by both houses of congress. The money freed up by President Goldwater's reduction in welfare spending now has a place to go. As a result, the United States of America has taken the first steps towards eliminating its national debt and ending the long-standing self-destructive policy of deficit spending.\n\nThis cap marks a minor milestone in the series of fiscal measures proposed by President Goldwater. While the bill is but a sideshow to the greater ambitions of the president, any victory in the American political colosseum is to be welcomed. Morale has surged amongst the president's supporters, and the Democratic wing of the Republicans-Democrats feels particularly empowered. It looks good for the president and his administration as now they have shown they can deliver on their promises and that they can cash the checks they write. This victory is bound to play particularly well in the South. The existence of vast national debt is humiliating to a proud and prosperous nation such as America, and many Southerners share this patriotic sentiment.\n\nWith this victory, the Goldwater administration can set its targets on the next piece of legislation.

Ultimately, the bill was but a sideshow to the greater ambitions of the president. Yet the rejection of the bill has made a few question whether the president can deliver on his promises and whether he can keep his party together.\n\nInternal divisions within the Republicans-Democrats proved to be the bill's undoing. Republican support of the bill was far from unanimous, and it seems that this dissent was the bill's death knell. It proves that the lingering cleavages within the party are still as relevant as ever. Reportedly, President Goldwater himself has voiced his frustration with the Republicans in congress to his vice-president, Nelson Rockefeller, himself a Republican.\n\nPresident Goldwater will have to hope he has more luck next time."

America will be building up its gold bullion reserve, restoring the promise that every dollar can be exchanged for gold. This way, we can end our dependence on the much more unstable silver: that second-rate inferior metal. In doing so, the ever-increasing trend towards inflation will be stopped dead in its tracks and prices will be stabilised.

When a party is so centered around being anti-establishment it becomes hard for them to work with the establishment. But politics makes for strange bedfellows. Senator Jackson was known as a dedicated opponent of both communism and fascism, and this made Goldwater like him at least somewhat, despite their differences.\n\n"Thank you for coming over, senator." Goldwater said as he entered the oval office, Senator Jackson being seated already. Goldwater dismissed the aide accompanying him and sat down behind his desk. The president explained his ambition: getting America back on the gold standard. All the while Jackson listened while smiling politely. When the president was done Jackson leaned forward in his seat and shared his thoughts.\n\n"Mr. President. I think we can come to an agreement here." a smile formed on Goldwater's face. "But let's look at some of your administration's other policies first. Specifically, what you're doing to the unions." Goldwater's smile changed into a more neutral expression, awaiting what would come next. The senator continued "I understand you're not a fan of the union: dismantling collective bargaining entirely."\n\nGodlwater leaned forward to respond but Jackson continued. "It's reprehensible, Mr. president."\n\n"Scoop" President Goldwater began, calling the senator by his nickname, "The unions have opposed my agenda at every turn.

Yet here they sat, in the White House having shaken hands and hammering out a possible deal.\n\n"Protecting all of God's creation is a worthy goal, Mr. President." Russel had started. From his intonation, Goldwater could already sense the looming word 'but'.\n\n"But-" Russel continued. "-I do have concerns on how this affects business." Goldwater was a laissez-faire man through and through, and Russel knew that an appeal to the president's belief in entrepreneurship was as good a bet as any. Still, Goldwater knew very well Russel's real reasons were much more pragmatic. In politics, everything has a price.\n\n"I am worried about business in the South.", and there it was, the reason for Russel having entered the White House today. Goldwater already knew Russel was fishing for some kind of exemption or preferential measure, but he would let Russel say it aloud himself first. Instead of getting to the point, Russel went off on a tangent about legalities building up to the question of how he wanted to achieve an exemption exactly. It was the kind of convoluted argument that would hold up in a court, but convince not a single rational individual.\n\nThe president can have his CWA, in return, Russel wants his CWA to apply just a little bit less to the South."

After all, we should preserve the beauty of God's creation for the coming generations." the senator took a breath, leaned forward, and continued "But let me be quite frank, the last thing I want is a federal board telling Southern businesses what they can and can not do do." Goldwater listened attentively and leaned back in his chair, taking a sip of water. "Be a bit more specific, Richard." he requested, as sometimes the political double-talk that plagued D.C. became too tedious for anyone to bear.\n\nRussel grinned and continued as requested "If we were to be a bit more involved in how this agency is run, it would certainly assuage some of our worst fears." The president inquired further: "If I am understanding correctly, you want your people on the board." Senator Russel smiled and shrugged in an exaggerated fashion, but the president already knew now what Russel wanted. "Well, Southerners from the NPP, definitely.

USA_sen_bill_desc_40:0 "The Pension Security Act seeks to build upon and expand earlier Social Security efforts by previous administrations to create a unified federal pension solution for all states and territories, while still adjusting the payout and input in relation to state wage levels and cost of living. Most importantly it aims to isolate the pension system from the effects of market swings and inflation, so that somebody who pays towards their pension all their working life will not suddenly find themselves living in poverty upon retirement. If passed, all retirees will be guaranteed an at least somewhat comfortable lifestyle in their dotage."
USA_sen_bill_name_41:0 "Labor Reform Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_41:0 "The Glenn Administration has reviewed a wealth of labor laws and found that Right to Work Laws need to be dealt with in some manner. Conceptualized before the start of the Second World War, Right to Work Laws safeguard the right for employees to not have to become a part of a Labor Union associated with their trade. Though it looks fair for the worker by allowing employers to not demand such requirements from their employees, there have been a great deal of issues stemming from them; namely, many employees have taken to taking in the benefits that the Labor Union provides for the company's employees without paying any of the sacrifices as the Union member employees do. This is an unfair and unjust practice, and Right to Work Laws have continuously allowed for loopholes within a variety of blue-collar trades that cannot continue any longer."
USA_sen_bill_name_42:0 "Social Security Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_42:0 "Elderly and disabled Americans are some of the most disadvantaged individuals in the population, with more than 40% living below the poverty line. As such, one of President John Glenn's most espoused campaign promises was to introduce legislation that would allocate a semi-livable income and healthcare coverage to all Americans over the age of 65, or suffering from a disability that prevents them from working. Based off of a bill proposed by the administration of Kennedy Sr., this 'Social Security Act' would allow Americans to allocate a percentage of their income into a special fund over the course of their working years. When they reach retirement, they may collect from the fund and have a steady stream of money flowing back into their pockets.\n\nWhile some conservative members of Congress have expressed absolute opposition to such a costly proposal, many more appear amiable or neutral to the bill. Consequently, both the President and the progressives in Washington anticipate being able to pass at least some of their desired reforms."

USA_sen_bill_desc_59:0 "The United States Armed Forces is already one of the biggest and most well equipped forces in the world, with technology and training that rivals, even surpasses, the other superpowers. Yet, the danger of falling behind is always there. President John Glenn is therefore asking for Congress to pass the Augmented Defense Act, to provide new money to fund cutting edge technology to ensure American arms in the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force will be superior well into the future. This will also see funding for upgrades and improvements to military bases in the US and around the world, with better housing for soldiers, and improvements in training. However, opposition to the President's already massive spending is fierce, and it will take all of the President's political savvy to get the ADA into law."

Marshall's legal career has spanned multiple decades, including being Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and being appointed to the Court of Appeals in 1961. His confirmation would make him the first Black justice in the history of the Supreme Court, and this has naturally attracted considerable controversy.

USA_sen_bill_desc_102:0 "The immense backlash to the Wallace administration has all but ensured that civil rights is a no-brainer in American politics, and as such, we have the opportunity to pass a Civil Rights Act of our own. This law would officially ban segregation nationwide, desegregate the armed forces, and institute a series of voting rights protections, to be enforced by the Department of Justice. While some on the far right are loudly protesting this act, nobody listens to them much anymore.

USA_sen_bill_desc_601:0 "One of the first acts of the McNamara administration - spearheaded by Vice President Birch Bayh - is to light the spark of innovation in America's universities and private industries. While American government subsidies for research have been in place for decades, current patent law gives the federal government ownership of breakthroughs made with federal funding, even if the government has no idea what to do with the invention. The Bayh-Dole Act allows private inventors to hold patent rights to their creations even if federal funding is received, in the hopes that the private sector will be able to turn conceptual breakthroughs into actual results."

USA_sen_bill_desc_602:0 "The Military Readiness Act of [GetYear] is the first major legislation aiming to fulfill one of President McNamara's policy priorities - a major overhaul of the American military to adopt cutting edge training and technology across all of its service branches. The draft bill goes into greater detail about military procurement and development programs than any preceding legislation, laying out a multi-year, program-based budget to address the McNamara administration's specific needs from the military. It also comes with a price tag to match its ambition - something the NPP's peaceniks and fiscal conservatives have been eager to oppose - but President McNamara believes that defending America can't be done on the cheap."
USA_sen_bill_name_603:0 "The FREE Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_603:0 "Following discussions with the more hawkish segments of the National Progressive Party on how best to win the Cold War, the McNamara administration has announced a set of bills granting the Executive Branch expansive authority to advance its foreign affairs agenda with reduced Congressional oversight. The Foreign Relations Executive Efforts Act will grant administrations the ability to respond quickly and decisively to foreign conflicts that affect American interests - with a 'Deployments, Overseas Military' provision for deploying American military units overseas if deemed necessary.\n\nMuch opposition is expected to the FREE Act and it's DOM provision. Constitutional hardliners within the R-Ds and more dovish members of the NPP are already arguing that the Act would gut Congress' traditional powers to declare and prosecute wars in the pursuit of short-term geopolitical objectives. But we can't turn back now - both for the hard work of our allies in the NPP, and for the sake of American victory in the Cold War."

It certainly flowed as rivers where Southern Knights and Boston Brahmins trawled in their westward course, whether the native's, the slave's, or the worker's. Yet underlying these atrocities is an essence that, for good or ill, so defines America's character that its qualities are imbued unto the nation's body politic: an uncontrollable drive to delve where none else had ventured.\n\nWe have chosen to harness America's pioneering spirit towards rectifying the injustices its elites had meted, and in restoring the justices they had deprived, for the Hall administration's first bill constitutes nothing less than an unprecedented leap towards racial equality. Its provisions surpass Harrington's vision for his "unseen Americans", itself miles ahead of the Republican-Democrats' pissant attempts at compromise. Abolishing the South's much-abused loopholes, enforcing total desegregation at the federal government's leisure, enacting affirmative action to all aspects of public life - what even idealists call fantasy, our version of the Civil Rights Act translates into leatherbound law.\n\nTrue justice will face no shortage of impediments between itself and Black America. Liberals will decry its breakneck pace for disregarding the milquetoast "baby steps" over which they obsess. Reactionaries will complain that it's a solution searching for a problem, blind as they ever are to problems grander than a faulty grill. Even our "allies" in the Party Center will question its far-reaching extent.\n\nBut no matter.

Its authors claim that, for the United States "occupies a special, preordained role in preserving the high culture of Western civilization", information which depicts the country in a negative manner must be punished accordingly, and its distribution subsequently curtailed.\n\nIn service of those ends, the SAFE Act stipulates press restrictions reminiscent of similar measures instituted during the Second World War. News of all media must be vetted by relevant federal agencies for "propaganda" before public dissemination; likewise, entertainment and associated paraphernalia must adhere to strict content guidelines established and enforced by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe act is derided by both Republican-Democrats and non-ANV National Progressives alike as a blatant assault on the American people's First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, quiet voices beyond the President's abstruse worldview argue in favor of conceding free speech in order to sate his growing, and rapidly radicalizing, base.\n\nBut better things are yet to come, claims President Yockey.

Nevertheless, the students and adults backing the Central-wing still aren't having it either, with folks like Henry Jackson adding fuel to the Senate fire trying to burn the SAFE Act by saying we're 'a group of bloody dictators,' while the Students are continuing to protest on campuses across the US, silencing potential support there."

President Bennett, a typically conservative Democrat, publicly spoke on the bill's passing alongside Vice President Ford, stating that the "time has come for African-Americans within our country to receive fair and just treatment, as the rest of our countrymen enjoy."\n\nAfrican-Americans across the country celebrate the passage of the Voting Rights Act, with many crediting the Republican legislators who raised awareness over the shortcomings of the original draft, which only sought to provide protections from voting irregularities rather than dismantling segregationist policies more thoroughly. For African-Americans, the President and his administration are a rare light of hope in a Democratic party that has more often sided with the status quo, with one man praising the President for "stepping past his political leanings to serve the people."\n\nHowever, many Southern Democrats have publicly criticized the bill for "overstepping the States' rights to make decisions for themselves." Furthermore, the Far Right branch of the NPP has sided with the Southern Democrats, claiming that the law is "an act of tyranny by the federal Government."

"Decades of failure in the legal system have fed our anger, and once again the President's promises were empty!" one protestor argued.\n\nIn statehouses across the South, the Democratic and FR-NPP opposition celebrate their victory. One Southern Democrat stated that "the extreme measures of the Voting Rights Act far exceeded what the Federal Government can decide in regards to States' rights." Southern leaders in the Far Right NPP were less circumspect, with one politician declaring that "segregation is here to remain in the United States, whether the Republicans like it or not!""

Congress is now seeking continuing legislation for extending previous spending levels into the next year, leaving military spending levels and troop deployment authorizations untouched.\n\nEven as President McGovern and his aides regroup after this setback, OFN ambassadors in Washington privately reported relief that the most radical provisions of the USA FREEDOM Act - namely, its proposals to begin select withdrawal of American troops from overseas - were rejected in Congress. The Australians, most notably, have relied on a robust U.S. presence to bolster their position on the doorstep of the Co-Prosperity Sphere for decades, and their ambassador publicly expressed their desire to reaffirm U.S.-Australian defense arrangements in the aftermath of the Act's failure."

Its provisions surpass Harrington's vision for his "unseen Americans", itself miles ahead of the Republican-Democrats' pissant attempts at compromise. Abolishing the South's much-abused loopholes, enforcing total desegregation at the federal government's leisure, enacting affirmative action to all aspects of public life - what even idealists call fantasy, our version of the Civil Rights Act translates into leatherbound law.\n\nTrue justice will face no shortage of impediments between itself and Black America. Liberals will decry its breakneck pace for disregarding the milquetoast "baby steps" over which they obsess.

Historically, African Americans had little help from the government in their fight for freedom; even the Fifteenth Amendment only gave blacks the right to vote on paper. There was no way of enforcing the policy, and over time, Southern states exploited loopholes in order to maintain the status quo of the land: poll taxes, literacy tests, the infamous "Grandfather clause". All of this would change when the senators voted in favor of passing this bill. Desegregationists rejoiced, Southern politicians foamed at the mouth.\n\nThis act sternly outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Unequal voting requirements were abolished; schools, businesses, and other public accommodations were officially desegregated. African Americans essentially gained the right to go to any school, work for any business, and attend any public facility they choose. As a whole, African Americans had political power that the race had never seen before, and this was only the first step towards full desegregation.\n\nBut not all was well in the South. Immediately, Southern voters flocked to Strom Thurmond's Far-Right NPP in hopes that the bill would be reversed, that society would return to normal. Many Southerners despised this blatant attack on their livelihood, and with support from Southern politicians, they had the power to physically defeat desegregation.

This country needs these women in uniform more than it needs me in the White House so frankly, my dears, I don't give a damn about re-election. Thank you.""

###Compromise Loc


RD_D_compromise_desc_101:0 "President Nixon spent a considerable amount of time pondering how to get the Southern Democrats to his side. The South always hated working with the North. If Nixon were to get through to the South, he would have to break this precedence by considering the one thing all Southerners hold dear: tradition.\n\nJoseph Clark Jr., a Pennsylvania senator, meets with Louisiana senator Allen J. Ellender. Both are Democrats, but the former advocates for civil rights while the latter is a hardcore segregationist, but a cooperative man. Clark is the first to speak. "I realize this new civil rights bill will have a far-reaching impact on the American South. But we're trying to work towards a plan that will free every American from discrimination."\n\nEllender had considered supporting the bill before but he knew that if it passed, the whole region would flare up. "Our states should choose their own direction with these so-called 'civil rights'-"\n\n"Your states have more important issues to address, Senator. This will be one legislation that provides opportunity for all Americans; it may boost your economy and make your region nicer to live in. After this, we will honor your state rights, but this must be an exception."\n\n"Do you not realize if this bill passes, our voters will turn to Thurmond's no-good Far-Right?"\n\n"I believe the storm will blow over eventually. We have everything to gain from this bill.""
