 POLITICS_LAHTAW_ZAU_SENG_DESC:0 "Zau Seng never knew a home. He was of Kachin origin and born in a Kachin town in the northern Shan states. As a teenager, he briefly served as a Kachin Ranger, one of the United States' wartime projects behind Japanese lines as part of the Office of Strategic Services. When the smoke cleared, Zau Seng barely escaped being charged as a traitor to the newly created State of Burma.\n\nHe spent the next couple of years doing various odd-jobs for the Burma National Army, mostly hunting down communist insurgents. Then, he spent eleven years making a name for himself as he fought alongside the Karen resistance before being sitting down with his younger brothers Zau Tu and Zau Dan, known to some as the Three Zaus, to create their own instrument of resistance – the Kachin Independence Organisation. And, from the Kachin Independence Organisation grew Zau Seng's private army – the Kachin Independence Army.\n\nZau Seng has built a small but extremely well trained army, drilling them in the English language that he was drilled in during his first experiences with war. While his brothers fight for ideological purposes, such as Zau Tu's interest in Maoism and Zau Dan's interests in diplomacy both abroad and at home, Zau Seng fights for a reason to fight."
