 NIK_pcoup_ponomaryovs_coup_desc:0 "식팁카르의 좌파들과 코미공산당은 오랜시간동안 공화국을 부르주아 민주주의적인 정부라며 비난해왔습니다. 옛 연방의 무덤에 침을 뱉으며, 식팁카르에 자본주의와 퇴폐를 가져다왔다고 말입니다.\n\n그러나, 서기장 보리스 포노마료프가 이끄는 공산당이 정권을 탈취함으로서 이러한 나날의 끝이 도래했습니다. 이전의 국회의원들은 체포되고 투옥되었으며, 오직 진정으로 충성스러운 이들만이 그들의 자리를 보존할 수 있었습니다. 식팁카르의 부르주아 민주주의는 끝이난 것처럼 보입니다. 적어도, 포노마료프와 그의 음지 속 후원자들은 그렇게 말할 것입니다."
 NIK_pcoup_appeal_for_a_united_party_desc:0 "일반적으로 좌파는 내부의 파벌주의와 조직 내 다툼으로 많은 명성을 얻었습니다. 하지만, 지금은 내부의 권력 투쟁이나 벌일 때가 아닙니다. 코미 혁명의 영향력을 공고히 하기 위해선 지금 당장만은 우리의 이론적 해석들 간의 자세한 사항들을 모두 집어치우고, 효과적이고 건설적인 통치를 위해 전력을 기울여야 합니다.\n\n서기장께서는 수슬로프 총리의 도움을 받아 현재의 비상 사태가 끝날 때 까지 파벌주의를 금지하고 허가된 행사들 이외의 정치적 행동을 중단시키는 칙령을 즉시 공표하실 것입니다."
 NIK_pcoup_find_zhdanovs_connections_desc:0 "안드레이 즈다노프는 코미 공산당의 '공식적인' 리더였지만, 그의 지위는 현재 임시 서기장 직위에 관하여 포노마로프의 지지를 표방한 수슬로프 때문에 일시적으로 정지된 상황입니다. 그는 당 내부 사람들에게 좀...괴짜같은 사람으로 여겨집니다만, 그는 매우 노련하며 수많은 연줄을 가지고 있습니다.\n\n우리의 정부를 수호하기 위해서, 우리는 그의 '독특한' 협력자들과 함께 하기 위해 즈다노프와 반드시 논의를 거쳐야 하며, 우리의 새로운 공화국을 지키기 위해 힘을 합쳐야만 합니다."
 NIK_pcoup_repurpose_the_systems_desc:0 "지금은 이상주의를 펼칠 때가 아닙니다. 옛 공화국의 관료주의는 그것의 기본적인 기능의 작업을 유지시키는데 중대한 역할을 했습니다. 국가의 핵심 기관들은 우리의 관리 아래에 계속해서 존재해왔지만, 현재 새로운 집권 정당인 우리들과 일종의 격한 대치 상태를 유지하고 있습니다.혁명이 진행중인 지금과 혁명이 끝난 후에도 우리의 집권이 계속해서 유지되기 위해서, 우리는 남아있는 정부 관료들을 고심하여 다루고 그들이 우리의 박애적인 의도를 두려워하지 않도록 하는 일련의 행동들을 반드시 취해야 합니다."
 NIK_pcoup_on_suslovs_orders_desc:0 "포노마료프가 당의 서기장이며, 그러므로 공화국의 수장일수는 있겠지만, 우리는 한 사람의 개인이 사회주의 체제를 만드는 것이 아님을 반드시 기억해야만 합니다. 공산당의 수석 이론가이자 공화국의 총리인 미하일 수슬로프라면 공산당의 핵심적인 민주주의적 가치들을 지켜낼 것이라고 믿을 수 있습니다. 과거 공화국의 대통령에게만 부여되었던 몇몇 다른 직권들뿐만 아니라 고위직의 임명권을 총리에게 부여하는 것은 새로운 사회주의 공화국의 수장이 결코 독재자가 되는 일이 없도록 보장해줄 것입니다."
 NIK_pcoup_lock_down_syktyvkar_desc:0 "이전 정부에 대항한 혁명은 많은 이들을 충격에 빠트렸으며, 이는 공화국 전역의 도심 중심부들을 불안정하게 했을 뿐만 아니라, 식팁카르를 완벽한 혼란의 도시로 만들었습니다. 수도 자체가 우리의 통제 아래에 있는 것은 사실이나, 우리는 외곽의 시골 지역에 공화국 군대의 잔당이나 반동들의 저항군이 자리잡고 있을지도 모른다는 것을 명심해야만 합니다. 따라서, 코미 소비에트 공화국의 상임간부회는 현재의 비상 사태가 종식될 때까지 식팁카르의 출입을 제한하는 법안을 통과시킬 것입니다."
 NIK_pcoup_mobilize_suslovs_men_desc:0 "옛 공화국 군대에 속해있던 사회주의 영웅들과 애국자들이 우리의 새 정부와 협력하며 우리에게 무기와 장갑차, 그리고 인력을 지원해 주고 있지만, 이건 우리가 기용할 수 있는 전력이 아닙니다. 혁명이 일어나기 전, 수슬로프 총리는 공화국에 진정한 프롤레탈리아의 통치를 위하여 당과 함께 협력하는 수많은 사회주의 준군사단체들과 파르티잔들의 양성을 감독했습니다. 이제 우리의 통제가 확립되었으니, 우리는 이제 이 예비군들을 공식적으로 코미의 붉은 군대로 재편성하여 진정으로 신뢰할 수 있는 군대를 창설할 수 있습니다."
 NIK_pcoup_hunt_down_Taboritsky_desc:0 "이반 세로프. 당의 저주받은 배신자이며, 한번은 우리의 노력들을 거의 박살낼 뻔한 사내. '붉은 파시즘'이라는 말도 안되는 개소리를 믿게 만들 뻔했던 그 남자.\n\n당의 만장일치 칙령에 따라, 세로프는 가능한 즉시 재판에 회부되어야만 합니다. 어떻게 보면, 그는 우리가 파시스트와 테러리스트들에게 가져다 줄 운명의 본보기가 되어 공화국의 전역의 모범이 될 것입니다. 옛 공화국은 반동들의 군세에 저항할 의지가 전혀 없었지만, 우리는 결코 그 실수를 되풀이 하진 않을 것입니다."
 NIK_pcoup_paralyze_the_army_desc:0 "우리의 편에 선 장교들과 사병들을 제외하면, 코미 공화국 군대는 본질적으로 반동적인 단체라고 할 수 있는 무언가입니다. 코미 공화국 군대를 대체할 우리의 유사-붉은 군대가 창설됨에 따라, 공식적으로 이전의 반동적인 군사 기관을 해체할 순간이 도래했습니다. 장군들은 투옥될 것이며, 파시스트 쁘락치들은 모두 청소될 것이고, 장비들은 더욱 건설적인 곳으로 용도변경될 것입니다. 우리군대에 미칠 영향은 적지 않겠지만, 그것은 일시적일 뿐이며, 그에 맞는 가치가 있을 것입니다."
 NIK_pcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_communist_party_desc:0 "혁명은 성공했습니다! 식팁카르의 모든 건물마다 적기가 휘날리며, 우리의 다른 도시들에서는 불과 한 달 전만 하더라도 부르주아들의 밀집 지역이었던 주요 대로들을 우리의 퍼레이드가 행진하고 있습니다. 옛 공화국은 마침내 종말을 맞이했으며, 자본주의적 과도기가 프롤레타리아 혁명에 의해 붕괴되고 우리의 새로운 사회주의 공화국이 그것의 잿더미에서 탄생했습니다. \n\n 이제 우리 내부의 일들이 끝났으며, 우리는 이제 소비에트 연방의 정당한 재수복을 시작해나갈 것입니다. 러시아의 인민들, 그리고 곧 전세계의 인민들은 우리를 해방자로서 맞이할 것입니다!"

 NIK_zcoup_zhdanovs_coup_desc:0 "마침내 부르주아 공화국의 막이 내렸습니다! 전선의 몰락 이후 코미 공화국의 인민들은 사회주의의 귀환과 인도를 꿈꿔왔고, 그 열망은 마침내 이루어졌습니다. 즈다노프 총서기장은 공화국의 지도자로서 통치에 나섰으며, 그의 동맹은 행정부와 국회를 손에 넣었습니다. 이에 인민들은 공산당의 귀환에 무척 기뻐하고 있습니다! \n\n그러나, 아직은 안심할 때가 아닙니다. 자유주의자, 사회-파시스트들, 구 정부라는 이름의 반동 즉 인민의 적들이 그늘진 곳에서 세를 키우며 마침내 자유를 맞은 인민의 정부를 전복시키려 합니다. 그러니 우리는 당의 위대한 선각자인 즈다노프 동지의 지도로, 반동분자들에 맞서 승리를 거머쥐고, 공화국을 새로운 시대로 인도하게 될 것입니다!"
 NIK_zcoup_the_peoples_alternative_desc:0 "의사당 건물에서 일반 시민에 이르기까지 코미 인민들이 안드레이 즈다노프야 말로 그토록 오랫동안 갈망해왔던 인물임을 깨닫게 해야합니다. 그는 어깨위에 강력한 머리를 가진 열정적인 인물이며, 그의 상냥한 성격과 호감가는 성격으로 금욕주의자 수슬로프와 비교할때 현실감을 느끼게 해주는 인물입니다.\n\n코미 당국은 즈다노프를 위한 지지를 표명하는 데 필요한 목소리를 국민들에게 제공하지 못했기 때문에 그는 그의 지혜로 문을 강제로 열고 시민들이 감사를 표할 수 있도록 선택했으며, 듣는것을 원하는 사람들에게 이러한 사실을 전파할 것입니다!"
 NIK_zcoup_connections_in_the_remnants_desc:0 "DSNP는 붕괴되고 불탔으며, 보즈네센스키의 소수의 정치인들 중엔 우방도 없고 실질적인 지지자도 남아 있지 않습니다. 우리가 그들에게 도움의 손길을 제공할 것입니다. 그들은 우리만큼 혁명적인 열정으로 가득 차있진 않지만, 그들의 이데올로기는 인도적이고 어쨋든...\n\n즈다노프가 친구의 소망을 존중하지 않는다면, 누가 하겠습니까?"
 NIK_zcoup_strike_against_tyranny_desc:0 "군주론자들과 사회 파시스트들은 코미의 힘을 약화시키는 데 만족하고 있습니다. 한심하게도! 만약 우리가 이러한 반동주의의 잔재를 제거하지 않으면 무슨 일이 생길까요? 그러나 즈다노프 정부 일각에서는 항의의 목소리를 내고 있습니다. 우리가 너무 빨리 공격한다면, 노력이 우리에게 역효과를 낼지도 모릅니다.\n\n즈다노프 자신은 다양한 파시스트들을 정원의 잡초처럼 제거하는 것에 만족하고 있지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 그는 그곳에 집중해야 합니다. 그리고 나서야 그는 야당의 운명을 결정할 것입니다."
 NIK_zcoup_promise_true_freedom_desc:0 "자유는 부르주아의 민주주의에서 찾을 수 없습니다. 거기에서 당신은 부가 흘러들어오는 자들에 의해 사슬에 묶여져 있고,  자신의 자유 의지가 아닌 다른 사람에 의해 자신의 미래가 결정됩니다. 파시즘에서도 자유를 찾을 수 없습니다. 그곳에서 당신은 비인간적인 전술에 희생되는 사람들의 정체성만을 수용하고자 하는 국가 정체성에 얽매여 있을겁니다.\n\n오직 즈다노프의 사회주의에서만 자유를 찾을 수 있을 것입니다! 투표하고, 생각하고, 토론하고, 자유롭게 걸으며 앞으로 나아가 역사의 끝이라는 개념을 깨뜨리는 것입니다!"
 NIK_zcoup_peoples_political_struggle_desc:0 "높은 성의 사나이들만이 결정을 내릴 수 있다고 생각한다면 어리석은 생각일 것입니다. 우리가 우리 자신을 막고 국민들이 원하는 것을 결정해야 한다고 말하는 사람이 누굽니까? 즈다노프의 코미는 귀족들의 궁전이 아닙니다! 우리는 이 나라의 미래를 결정하는 것이 그들의 말임을 국민들에게 깨우쳐야 합니다.\n\n정치에 관여하는 사람들은 사회주의 사상을 토론하는 데 전념하는 지방 단체에 가입하도록 장려될 것이고, 정부 관청에 채용될 것입니다. 노인, 젊은이, 남성, 여성 모두가 코미를 미래로 이끌 것입니다!"
 NIK_zcoup_freeze_the_activities_desc:0 "자본주의자들과 파시스트들은 인류 발전을 위한 우리의 노력을 파괴하고 타격할 기회를 기다리며 영원히 그늘 속에서 숨어있을 것입니다. 그것이 바로 즈다노프가 아이디어를 제안한 이유입니다. 야당들의 노력을 늦추기 위해 합법적이든 비합법적이든 조치를 취할 것입니다.\n\n그의 지혜에서, 즈다노프는 그들이 하는 모든 것에 쉽게 맞설 수 있는 방식으로 그들의 발걸음을 재촉하도록 강요할 것입니다. 사회주의라는 횃불을 들고 있는 한 아무도 인류를 무너뜨리지 못할 것입니다!"
 NIK_zcoup_seed_the_files_desc:0 "자본주의자들에 대해 많은 것들을 말할 수 있지만, 즈다노프는 자신을 포함해서 정부의 보다 급진적인 사람들은 민주주의의 중심이 결국 파시스트들의 위협을 불러오기 위한 도구에 불과하다고 봅니다. 그러나 코미 인구의 대부분은 이 생각에 동의하지 않을 것입니다.\n\n피할 수 없는 행동을 취하기로 결정했습니다. 제조업의 부패와 코미의 민주적 요소 내에서의 뇌물 공여로 우리는 그들의 몰락을 재촉하고 그들이 어떤 모습으로 변할지 폭로할 것입니다."
 NIK_zcoup_silence_the_unswayed_desc:0 "우리와 같은 비전을 공유하지 않는 사람들이 있습니다. 아니, 한 걸음 더 나아가서, 그들은 우리의 비전을 파괴하고, 괴롭히고, 다른 것으로 타락시키려고 합니다. 우리는 반동분자들에 의해 파괴되는 것을 용납하지 않을 것입니다. 역사상 이런 일이 여러 번 있었지만, 여기서는 일어나지 않을 것입니다. 코미를 파멸시키기를 원하는 이 반동들의 목소리 또한 무너질 것입니다.\n\n그리고 그러한 반대는 영원히 침묵할 것입니다."
 NIK_zcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_people_desc:0 "드디어 혁명이 성립되었습니다! 우리는 혁명을 지켜냈고, 이제 더 이상 반혁명이나 순수한 사회주의에 대한 즈다노프의 비전을 더럽힐 어떠한 위협도 걱정할 필요가 없을 것입니다. 우리 대중들의 지지로 인해 코미의 전진을 막을 수 있는 것은 아무것도 없습니다. 어떠한 자본주의자나 파시스트도 우리를 가로막는 것을 허락하지 않을 것입니다. 즈다노프가 지휘봉을 잡고 정부의 안색을 갖춘다면 코미는 절대 부숴질 수 없을 것입니다!\n\n이제 과거의 죄, 후회, 실수에서 벗어났기 때문에 해야할 길은 오직 한 가지 뿐입니다.\n\n미래를 향하여!"

 NIK_bcoup_bukharinas_coup_desc:0 "코미가 혼란에 빠져들자 스베틀라나 부하리나는 이 혼란을 기회를 보고 공산당을 이끌어 정부를 장악했습니다. 하지만 이 통제는 믿을 수 없을 정도로 취약하며 우리의 반대편에 의해 뒤집힐 위험이 존재합니다. 코미의 혁명이 성공할 수 있도록 신속히 대처해야 합니다!"
 NIK_bcoup_the_legitimate_option_desc:0 "20년 전만 해도 소련은 나치 위협으로부터 시달려왔습니. 그러나 서러시아 혁명 전선이 서러시아 전쟁의 끝날때까지 서러시아에 대한 지배권을 유지한 것처럼, 이것이 러시아에서의 공산주의의 종식을 의미하는 것은 아닙니다, 우파들의 주장에도 불구하고 코미가 진정으로 혁명적인 깃발 아래 있지 않은 것은 불과 몇 년밖에 되지 않았습다. 이 모든 것을 고려하면 공산주의 아래의 코미가 정통성을 가진 유일한 코미라는 것은 명백한 사실입니다. 우리의 정당한 대의명분인 이러한 사실들을 인민들이 알리기 위해 우리는 코미의 가장 고립된 시골지역까지 멀리까지 이 사실을 방송할 것입니다!" 
 NIK_bcoup_fully_seize_the_party_desc:0 "코미를 완전히 통제하고 더 많은 혼란을 막기 위해서는 우선 공산당에 대한 통제권을 확보해야 한다. 부카리나가 당의 과반을 장악하고 있지만, 여전히 혁명과 부카리나에 충성하지 않는 사람들이 있다. 이들은 주로 즈다노프파들이며 어떤 변화도 반혁명적이라고 보는 정통파 공산주의자들도 있다. 물론 당의 이념적 차이를 넘어 내부로부터 우리를 깎아내리려는 기회주의자들이 있다. 우리는 내분을 피할 수 있도록 이념적 반대자들과의 공통점을 찾으려고 노력할 수 있지만, 공산주의를 사실상 파멸로만 이끄는 당내의 모든 사람들을 찾아내고 처리할 수 있도록 세심하게 조사해야 할 것이다."
 NIK_bcoup_propaganda_blackout_desc:0 "코미의 거리 전체에 걸쳐선 선전과 전파가 퍼지고 있습니다. 그 중 대부분은 우리의 선전이지만 나머지 선전물은 중도파와 우파들이 인민들을 자기 편으로 끌어들이기 위한 절박한 시도에서 나온 것이다. 어떤 경우에도 우리는 이런 일이 일어나도록 내버려 둘 수 없다. 이러한 선전선동에 대항하기 위해서 우리는 가능한 한 어떤 방법으로든 그것을 소멸시킬 것 입니다. 거리에서 우리는 우리의 추종자들에게 반동적인 포스터를 철거하도록 고무시켜 우리가 가능한 모든 전선에서 그들과 싸울 것임을 보여줄 것이다. 우리는 포스터나 다른 물리적 선전에 반대하는 집회를 하는 동안, 우리는 기술을 활용하여 반동주의자들의 선전과 라디오 방송국을 찾아내 제거할 것입니다. 운만 따라준다면 혁명에 대한 위협도 끝낼 수 있겠죠."
 NIK_bcoup_we_are_benevolent_desc:0 "옛날, 마르크스는 공산주의라는 유령에 대해 썼습니다. 그는 그것이 전 유럽을 괴롭히고, 모든 것을 두려움에 떨게 한 동화라고 말했습니다. 구소련의 존재에도 불구하고 이 유령은 노약자부터 청년까지 코미의 많은 사람들을 괴롭히고 있습다. 따라서 현재 코미의 혼란에도 불구하고 우리는 자비로운 세력임을 국민에게 보여줘야 한다. 힘들 수도 있지만, 우리는 어떤 식으로든 싸움에 휘말린 사람들을 도와야 한다. 이런 시대에 국민에게 손을 내밀어 도와줌으로써 우리 또한 도덕적으로 높은 지위의 이익을 얻을 수 있으며, 결국 코미의 다른 정당들은 이런 위기상황에 있는 사람들에게 자신의 자원을 쓰려 하지 않을 것이다. 인민들은 우리의 생명줄이며, 우리는 그들을 지지해야 합니다!"
 NIK_bcoup_fight_to_save_us_all_desc:0 "코미는 국민에 대한 여러 가지 위협이 있는 곳입니다. 세로프와 샤파레비치의 파시즘이든, 아니면 스탈리나의 이른바 '민주주의'든 사회주의 불씨를 끄집어내고 인민을 영원한 어둠 속에 빠뜨리려는 위협은 수없이 많습니다. 어떤 상황에서도 우리는 이런 위협이 발생하도록 내버려 둘 수 없다. 물론 우리는 지금 현재 이러한 존재들이 우리의 안전과 자유에 대한 지속적인 위협라는 것을 인민들에게 확실히 알려야 한다. 결국 지금 자신의 처지를 잘못 알고 있는 것은 국민에게 아무런 도움이 되지 않을 것이니깐요. 코미의 모든 국민을 위해, 아이들부터 노인까지, 우리는 그들의 자유를 위해 싸울 것입니다!" 
 NIK_bcoup_make_peace_where_we_can_desc:0 "코미에는 안정되기 위해서는 제거해야 하는 요소가 많지만, 우리와 협상할 수 있는 요소도 많습니다. DSNP에서 Zhdanov의 옛 연락책들 중 일부는 협상을 통해 우리 편으로 넘어올 수 있기를 희망 할 수 있으며, 또한 싸움에 관련된 모든 사람들이 그들의 특정한 이념만을 위해 전적으로 헌신하지는 않을 게 할 것입니다. 올바른 방송과 선전과 함께, 반동분자들에 대한 지속적인 승리와 함께, 우리는 바라건대 점점 더 많은 적을 제거할 수 있을 것이다. 능숙한 계책으로 우리는 바라건대 이곳 코미의 공산주의에 대한 많은 위협 중 일부를 평화롭게 끝낼 수 있을 것입니다!"
 NIK_bcoup_make_war_everywhere_else_desc:0 "모든 사람을 상대로 평화적으로 협상 할 수 있는 것은 아닙니다. 여기 코미에는 반동주의자가 너무 많아 완전히 파괴해야 할 경우도 역시 많습니다. 그들이 식팁카르의 거리에 숨어 있든, 시골에 숨어 있든, 이런 반동주의자들 누구라도 존재하도록 허용하는 것은 정부가 다시 타도 당할 것을 부탁하는 것과 같습니다. 우리는 그들의 반동적 위협들을 파괴하고 뿌리뽑기 위해 노력해야 합니다. 게다가, 우리는 그들의 지지 기반을 약화시키면서 그들이 내뱉는 헛소리를 끝내기 위해 그들의 라디오 방송국을 파괴 해야 합니다. 이렇게 시간이 흐르면 우리는 스탈리나, 샤파레비치든, 반동적 지도자들을 한 번 그리고 영원히 찾아내고 돌볼 수 있을 것이다. 자유의 혁명적인 불꽃은 이런 머저리들에 의해 결코 꺼지지 않을 것이다!" 
 NIK_bcoup_out_of_harms_way_desc:0 "코미에는 폭력에 넘쳐 있다. 폭력이 줄어들려면 시간이 걸릴 것으로 보이는 만큼 국민 보호에 힘을 쏟아야 한다. 정치적 지원의 필요성으로 이를 정당화할 수도 있겠지만 결국 코미의 많은 국민은 그저 행복 속에서 살기를 바라는 무고한 민간인이다. 정당한 이유에서라도 그들을 총에 맞아 쓰러지게 하는 것은 역겨운 일이다. 그들은 자신의 삶이 혼돈으로 가득차길 요구하지 않았는데, 왜 그들은 다른 사람들이 저지른 일에 대한 결과와 마주해야 하는것인가? 민간인을 보호하는 데는 자원이 들겠지만, 결국 우리가 대표하는 사람들을 보호하지 못한다면 우리가 진정으로 그들의 구세주인가?"
 NIK_bcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "소련의 깃발은 러시아 인민들에게 많은 것을 가져왔다. 그것은 산업화, 진보된 편안함, 그리고 현대성을 가져왔다. 그러나 가장 중요한 것은 그것이 인민들에게 자유를 가져다 주었다. 코미 공화국이라는 재앙은 국민들로 하여금 이러한 자유를 잃게 만들 뻔 했다. 그러나 부하리나가 코미에 대한 지배권을 굳히면서 국민의 자유는 점점 더 커질 것으로 보인다. 스탈리나의 반쪽짜리 민주주의도, 샤파레비치의 파시즘도 없을 것이다! 아니, 인민의 쇠사슬이 영원히 끊어진 채로 남아 있을 것임을 나타내는 소비에트의 귀환만이 남아 있을 것이다!"

 NIK_comexpansion_reliable_commissars_desc:0 "우리가 역쿠데타를 당할 가능성은 더이상 없지만, 코미가 완전히 안정된 곳이 아니라는 사실은 여전합니다. 게다가, 우리는 수많은 장교들이 공산주의의 이상에 반하는 교육을 받았다는 사실 때문에 우리는 정치적으로 교육받은 수많은 장교들에 의존할 수는 없습니다. 우리는 정부와 군대 간의 이념의 분열을 막을 뿐만 아니라, 군대가 우리의 적들에게 공감을 가지는 것을 막음으로서 코미의 질서와 안정을 유지하는 것을 가능하게 해줄 가장 믿음직스럽고 새로운 정치 장교들을 육성해야만 합니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_soviet_training_desc:0 "우리는 군대를 훈련시키기 위해 최선의 노력을 다했지만, 이들이 수준 미달이라는 것은 부정할 수 없는 진실입니다. 러시아의 다른 군벌들은 더욱 전문적인 수준을 유지하기 위하여 사관 학교나 다양한 장군들에 의지할 수 있었습니다. 상황를 바로잡기 위해, 우리 군대의 부족한 부분들을 바로잡는 것을 돕기 위하여 옛 소련의 사관 학교를 활용하라는 결정이 내려졌습니다. 결과를 체감하기까지 시간이 좀 걸릴지 몰라도, 군대가 러시아를 통일할 수 있을 만큼 강해지기 위해서는 현대화와 적절한 훈련이 필요하기 때문에, 그것은 필요한 결정입니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_road_to_archangelsk_desc:0 "서러시아의 모든 군벌들 중에서, 서러시아 혁명 전선은 동맹으로 여겨질 수 있는 몇 안 되는 세력 중 하나입니다. 비록 WRRF는 우리의 민간 정부와 달리 군부의 통치가 진행 중이지만, 그들은 여전히 공산주의의 이상을 따르고 있습니다. 이 동맹일 수 있는 관계에서 이득을 얻기 위해선, 우리는 WRRF에게 관계의 개선의 시도로서 외교관을 보낼 필요가 있습니다. 코미가 서러시아 전쟁 후에 독립하여 분리되었기에 전선이 우리를 적으로서 볼지도 모른다는 불안감이 존재하나, 우리가 그렇듯 전선 또한 서러시아에서 동맹을 찾을 수 있기를 매우 원할 것입니다. 전선과의 협력은 우리를 승리로 이끌 것입니다!"
 NIK_comexpansion_a_pact_with_the_front_desc:0 "다행히도, 전선에 대한 우리의 외교적 접근은 좋은 반응을 얻었고, 주코프 대원수는 코미와의 조직화를 원하고 있습니다. 솔직히 말해서, 이것은 코미의 놀라운 승리입니다. 이제 우리는 옛 소련의 붉은 군대의 지원을 받으며, 그들의 자원과 장비에 대한 접근권을 가지고 있습니다. 우리의 북쪽 측면은 안전할 뿐만 아니라 외교적, 군사적 관점에서도 우리가 우위를 점하고 있기 때문에 전략적 이득은 엄청납니다. 우리는 완전한 이익을 얻기 위해 전선과의 협력을 더욱 강화해야 하며, 그들이 원하는 한, 서러시아를 통합하려는 우리의 목표는 훨씬 쉬워질 것입니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_equal_ally_desc:0 "WRRF와의 본질적인 협력에 관해 당내에서 논의가 있었습니다. 어떤 이들은 코미가 전선에게 압도되어 파멸할 것이라 믿으며, 다른 이들은 우리가 군대의 통제권을 장악하고 문민통제를 재확보해야 한다고 주장합니다. 문민통제는 분명 매력적인 안건이나, 문제는 전선은 너무나 오랫동안 독립적으로 기능했다는 사실입니다. 그들이 우리에게 즉시 복종하라고 요구하는 것은 우리의 하나밖에 없는 동맹과의 분쟁을 일으킬 뿐입니다. 아마, 이에 대한 적절한 해결책은 전염병과 같은 반동들로부터 러시아의 해방을 원하는 동등한 동맹으로서 그들과 손잡는 것입니다. 물론 언젠가는 전선을 완전히 합병할 수 있는 가능성에 대해 재고해볼지도 모르지만, 지금은 아닙니다. 이제, 우리는 우리들의 원수와 싸워야 합니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_shared_training_exercises_desc:0 "우리는 옛 소련의 전술들을 바탕으로 새로운 붉은 군대를 훈련시키기 위해 최선을 다했지만, 글로서 남아있는 전술 자료들의 부족이 우리 군대의 전술적 역량의 성장을 방해하고 있습니다. 이를 해결하기 위하여 우리는 주코프 대원수에게 전선과 코미의 군대가 서로 경험을 쌓을 수 있도록 장교 교류를 통한 합동 훈련을 제안했습니다. 지금으로서는 전선이 양군 중에서 더 숙련되어 있겠지만, 이렇게 제공된 조언들은 우리의 붉은 군대에게 큰 도움이 되어 우리에게 대항하는 다양한 군벌들과의 전투를 성공적으로 이끌 것입니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_march_as_one_desc:0 "아주 오랫동안, 코미는 혼자였습니다. 전선과의 관계는 기묘하고 적대적이었으며, 누군가는 코미를 보고 서러시아 전쟁의 패배에 기여한 비겁자라고 생각했습니다. 그러나 그러한 나날들은 지나갔으며, 코미와 WRRF는 이제 그 어느 때보다도 가까운 사이입니다. 하지만 우리는 상호방위협정을 맺음으로 그들과 진정한 동지라는 것을 확실히 해야만 합니다. 이것은 우리의 연합을 단결시킬 것이며, 한쪽이 공격받을 때 다른 한쪽이 함께 싸워주는 것으로 다가오는 재통합 전쟁에서 서로를 도와줄 수 있는 진정한 조력자로 볼 수 있게 될 것입니다. 우리 북쪽 국경의 방비는 안전할 것이기에, 우리는 더이상 기습공격의 공포에 시달리지 않고 다른 군벌들과 전쟁을 시작할 수 있습니다. 서러시아의 재통합은 이제 멀지 않았습니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_icy_reception_desc:0 "알 수 없는 이유로, WRRF가 우리와의 협력 시도를 거절했으며, 그들은 우리의 외교관을 돌려보냈습니다. 그러므로, 우리는 전선이 우리에게 적대적이며, 러시아를 재통합하기 위해서 반드시 정복해야 할 또 하나의 적이 추가되었다고 추측할 수밖에 없습니다. 서러시아 전쟁 이후 코미의 독립 때문에 그들은 우리를 배신자들이라고 여기는 듯 합니다. 어쨌든, 아무 문제 없습니다. 잠재적인 동맹이었던 전선을 잃어버린 것은 크지만, 치명적이진 않습니다. 우리는 전선의 침공으로부터 저 단결의 배신자들이 아닌 우리들이 승리하도록 확실한 노력을 취해야만 합니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_bunkers_to_the_north_desc:0 "전선이 소극적이라 추측하고 싶지만, 그들도 그들의 깃발 아래 러시아를 재통일하려는 노력과 함께 움직이고 있을 가능성이 높습니다. 우리가 그들과 국경을 마주하고 있기에, 우리가 첫 번째는 아니더라도 전선의 우선적인 목표일 가능성이 높습니다. 우리는 북부 국경선이 우리가 대다수의 병력을 동원할 수 있을 만큼 충분히 오랫동안 공격을 견뎌낼 수 있도록 해야 합니다. 가장 좋은 방법은 시솔라 전역을 벙커로 도배해버리는 겁니다. 이러한 벙커들은 갈등 상황에서 알맞은 방비를 우리에게 주어 북쪽의 갈라진 이들로부터 코미를 수호할 수 있도록 해줄 것입니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_spread_confusion_desc:0 "WRRF는 우리를 적대하고 있지만, 그들은 여전히 공산주의의 이념에 의해 뒷받침되고 있습니다. 따라서 전선에도 코미를 적대하는 것에 대해 반발심을 갖는 이들이 많을 것으로 보입니다. 우리는 공산당이 이끄는 정부에 등을 돌림으로써 가장 어두운 때에 혁명이 어떻게 배신당했었는지에 대해 비밀스럽게 전선에 선전함으로써 이것을 활용할 필요가 있습니다. 게다가, 우리는 전선의 기반시설과 지뢰들을 파괴해야만 합니다. 이러한 혼란을 확산시키려는 이중적인 노력들이 전선을 더욱 분열시키고, 그들로부터의 공격을 예방하고, 그들을 상대하는 것을 더욱 쉽게 만들어 줄것이라 전망하고 있습니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_watching_our_rear_desc:0 "우리가 WRRF을 막기 위해 우리의 모든 군대를 배치할 수는 없지만, 그쪽의 국경을 완전히 무방비 상태로 놔두는 것은 태만에 지나지 않을 것입니다. 최근 벙커 구축 노력이 우리의 방어력을 높일 수 있게 해주었지만, 우리는 더 많은 것을 해야 합니다. 시솔라 지역의 순찰이 증가할 것이며, 우리는 우리의 후방을 보호하기 위한 감시를 강화할 것입니다. 이렇게 병력을 늘리면 전선이 공격하지 않을 수 있고, 전선이 공격해 올지라도 우리의 방어력이 강화되어 그들이 중요한 지역들을 확보하지 못하고, 동시에 많은 사상자를 낼 수 있을 것입니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_safe_north_desc:0 "서러시아 전쟁 이후, 러시아는 셀 수도 없는 작은 군벌들에 의해 오염되었고, 그들 모두가 자신들이 진정한 구원자라 주장해왔습니다. 이제는 끝낼 것입니다. 이 군벌들의 시대에 종막을 가져오고 공산주의의 붉은 깃발을 다시 휘날릴 때가 돌아왔습니다. 우리는 지역 군벌들과 맞서 싸워 우리의 통치 아래 놓아야 합니다. 계획을 짜고, 군대를 움직이고, 우리의 통치에 저항하는 사태를 막기 위해 관료들은 새 영토들을 관리할 준비를 해야 합니다. 우리가 재통일을 완수하는 과정은 너무나 길고 고된 싸움이겠지만, 우리가 하지 않는다면 러시아는 영원히 지금의 무정부 상태에서 벗어나지 못하는 비극을 맞이하게 될 겁니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_against_the_tsarists_desc:0 "WRRF의 붕괴는 많은 다양한 군벌들을 집권시켰고, 많은 군벌들이 자신을 “진정한“ 러시아라고 주장해왔습니다. 그들 중 가장 고약한 이들은 바로 뱟카입니다. 이 차리스트들은 1917년 그 자체의 무게로 무너진 체제인 군주제의 재실현만을 바라고 있습니다. 뱟카인들은 우리의 바로 남쪽에 위치해있으며, 그렇기에 그들은 의심의 여지 없이 코미가 직면한 가장 거대한 위협입니다. 우리는 이 위협이 우리의 국경에서 곪아터지길 기다리는 것도, 이 반동분자들의 공격이라는 위험을 방치할 수도 없습니다. 우리는 다시 한번 러시아에서 저 차리스트들을 몰아내야만, 우리는 마침네 군주주의의 망령으로부터 해방될 수 있을 것입니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_build_the_line_desc:0 "뱟카와의 전쟁은 결코 쉽지 않을 것입니다. 우리가 그들의 방어선을 완전히 뚫는 데는 시간이 걸릴 가능성이 높기에, 우리는 국경에 방어선을 구축해야만 합니다. 우리는 뱟카강을 따라 요새들을 건축하게 될 것이며, 그렇게 되면 만약 우리가 차르주의자들을 즉시 공격할 수 없더라도 저들의 군대를 붙잡아둘 수 있는 예비 계획을 얻게 될 것입니다. 이 방어선은 철조망, 벙커, 감시초소들, 뱟카를 상대로 막아내기 위해 필요한 모든 것들이 포함될 것입니다. 그러나 이 방어선은 종합적이기는 하지만 우리에게 필요한 것은 방어용 건물들만이 아닌 전쟁 자체에 기여할 수 있는 자원이 필요하기 때문에, 이것들이 최대한의 잠재력을 발휘하지는 못할 것입니다."
 NIK_comexpansion_ready_the_south_desc:0 "뱟카에 대한 성공적인 군사작전을 실행하기 위해선, 우리가 전쟁을 할 준비가 되어 있는지 확인해야 합니다. 이를 위해 우리는 코미 남부를 중심으로 동원령을 시행해야 하며, 그렇게 되면 실제로 차리스트들과 싸울 수 있는 충분한 병력이 확보될 수 있을 것입니다. 우리는 우리 부대가 이 전쟁에 대비할 수 있도록 만들 것입니다. 게다가, 우리는 뱟카강을 건너기에 가장 좋은 장소를 찾기 위해 우리 군의 공병들을 보낼 것입니다. 우리 장군들은 전쟁 초기에 뱟카강을 건너고 확보하는 것이 매우 중요할 것이라고 판단했습니다. 그래서 도하를 즉흥적으로 하게 된다면 우리의 전쟁 노력에 치명적일 것입니다. 우리는 차리스트들을 격퇴할 준비가 되어있어야 합니다!"

Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago." 
 NIK_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_west_russian_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery."
 NIK_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_world_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion.

 NIK_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_motherland_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars.

All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."

However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts.

Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."

If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."

This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly.

Thusly, rather than the standard diplomatic practices of most nations, the Paramount Leader has ordered the Foreign Ministry to construct a grand edifice in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] - the Embassy of the Global Proletariat.\n\nThis edifice shall contain representatives of the working class across the world, with delegates that embody the spirit of the working class of each and every nation. While our relations may be limited now, there is no reason to limit ourselves - nations that refuse to send delegates shall be properly represented as well, by Soviet citizens that best exemplify the socialization of the working class within their host nation's civilization.

As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada.

Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal.

In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose.

Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."

A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_zhdanov_congratulate_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."

Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."

 NIK_suslov_restore_the_red_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago."
 NIK_suslov_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery. "
 NIK_suslov_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_suslov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_suslov_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_suslov_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_suslov_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."

Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_suslov_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_suslov_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 NIK_suslov_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_suslov_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_suslov_the_red_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

However, it will be the goal of the new regime to change the public perception of itself, from an allegedly totalitarian state to one of equality and opportunity.\n\nIn the age of communication, it has never been easier to spread a message through radio and on television. The government will use that to its advantage, and reaffirm to its people and to the world that it is dedicated to the principles of humanism, and to an egalitarian society different from the failed Union. Once we have done that, we can begin to make sure it becomes the reality on the ground, and a new era for the nation will be ushered in."
 NIK_bukharina_a_free_woman_desc:0 "The fact that a woman is the leader of the state is already a testament to the equal opportunities presented by the new Union, but it is not quite enough. As per the General Secretary's wish, steps will be taken in the direction of gender equality within the framework of the socialist state. To begin with, a committee will be formed of special advisors from both genders on Comrade Bukharina's orders, and its purpose will be none other than to support social equality and solve any disputes in that regard. From there, it will be a process of gradually getting laws and amendments passed, so that women may finally be free and equal to men in the workplace, at home, and in society as a whole."
 NIK_bukharina_a_free_worker_desc:0 "The goal of a communist state is, above all, to guarantee the freedom and the power of the common worker. The government understands this, and will immediately begin taking progressive measures with said goal in mind. Primitive laws on workers' rights already exist, but they are often not optimal or are not followed in certain areas. These laws will be reformed and codified as per the wishes of the Congress and the Presidium, while those who do not follow them are to be punished accordingly. In addition, the changes will be publicized through media, so that everyone learns of the leaps the new Union has made."
 NIK_bukharina_return_to_kollontai_desc:0 "Alexandra Kollontai, as one of the few female Old Bolsheviks, is considered an early champion of women's rights and for good reason. She spearheaded the idea of Marxist feminism, the idea that true gender equality in all aspects can only be achieved as a result of a socialist revolution like the one the Bolsheviks planned and eventually executed.\n\nWhile that may not have been completely achieved, it is now Comrade Bukharina's will and our duty to continue Kollontai's legacy. Her ideology will not only be accepted, but we shall bake it into law as a not insignificant part of the new Union's ideology and policy. Therefore, we will assure Russia is entrenched as a champion of equality and one of the first nations to truly confront the matter."
 NIK_bukharina_a_culture_of_questioning_desc:0 "The Russians and other ethnicities inside our borders are often defined by century-old traditions and moral codes. However, what do they matter if all they do is hold us back and prevent progress comparable to the rest of the world? Lenin and Bukharin started launched the idea of questioning these long-lasting traditions as they occasionally proved to be hurdles in the development of society, but never finished it. The warlord era was another blow to these new ideas, but we are here to fix that.\n\nThe General Secretary and the Presidium have agreed on a course of action through which the state will encourage rethinking these ancient cultural trends. An abundance of speeches and propaganda will help to achieve much-needed progress."
 NIK_bukharina_empower_the_councils_desc:0 "As the next step in giving the workers more power over their jobs, the local soviets across the country will be trusted with a certain level of control and self-autonomy. They will be allowed to set forth their own candidates for representation, as well as be the ones who decide quotas for production and several other measures that deal with their own workplace.\n\nOf course, the Presidium understands that no group can be completely trustworthy when they have control, and for that reason the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation will be useful. As the service to ensure everything runs smoothly, they will be observing the different factories and councils, seeking any dishonest men and women who would dare lie about their reports and work."
 NIK_bukharina_open_the_government_desc:0 "In order to ensure a truly free society, the government must be transparent and open with the people. In order to raise the people's confidence in our state apparatus, we shall open certain archives for public viewing, and pass an order to declassify certain documents after a statute of limitations has passed. Whilst the security apparatus is important, and some things must remained buried, to be open and honest about the People's government is a paramount task."
 NIK_bukharina_for_your_own_good_desc:0 "A free society is important, but the government cannot always be liberal with its recordkeeping. If the security of the state is compromised, even for ostensibly pure reasons, then all will be in danger. As such, we cannot make government records public. This is especially true for information pertaining to state security. It may not be popular, but the people will understand that it is for their own good."
 NIK_bukharina_declare_an_extraordinary_session_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of resurgent Russia to combat any remaining counter-revolutionary movements, some cells and underground groups still linger and remind us of the days of the Komi Republic's turbulent politics. Suslovite and Zhdanovite supporters continue to exist both among the citizens of the country and in some cases inside the government, perhaps plotting to overthrow it.\n\nThis cannot stand. The Presidium, responsible for governing the country, and the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation, responsible for keeping it safe, will convene as soon as possible to discuss solutions to this urgent matter. Under the supervision of the General Secretary, their task for the near future will be to eliminate the last threats to the state, so that we can move forward."
 NIK_bukharina_a_loyal_police_force_desc:0 "Our past of cooperation with Suslovite and Zhdanovite elements still haunts us, as they have contacts in important positions even to this day. For example, the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation - a body meant to serve the government and protect its people - has possibly been infiltrated by these revisionists, and must now be reformed.\n\nTrusted men and women, who have stood on the side of the General Secretary since the early days, will be put in charge of the operation to identify and purge any possible dissidents and agents. Anyone deemed disloyal inside the URS will be discharged, and if their treason to the state is proven, tried for their crimes. Only through a clean police force will the revolution be able to survive and expand."
 NIK_bukharina_blind_the_ultravisionaries_desc:0 "The strange and esoteric ideas of the Ultravisionaries are, ultimately, dangerous to the welfare and security of the state. It is clear that Zhdanov's faction must be dealt with. Known members will be expelled from government office, their leaders will be discredited in the court of public opinion, and they will be watched carefully for the rest of their lives. This bizarre cult will be excised, as cleanly and decisively as possible."
 NIK_bukharina_shackle_the_dogmatists_desc:0 "Mikhail Suslov's hardline faction has been sidelined, and Suslov himself removed from the equation entirely. However, we still need to deal with many of its members who remain in public office. They need not be purged as thoroughly as Zhdanov's people, but we still must remove them from positions of power. A few retirements here, and a few reassignments there. The old dogmatists must not be able to threaten our efforts."
 NIK_bukharina_peace_at_last_desc:0 "At last, our position in the government is secure. The esotericists and hardliners have been removed from power, and any threat that they would pose to us has been effectively neutralized. We still need to ensure that those in government who have voiced concerns are properly dealt with, but after some stern messaging, they should get the picture. Our republic has been united under the left, and we may move towards a better future for all."
 NIK_bukharina_the_march_to_utopia_desc:0 "With our republic's new government united and strong, we can begin the march towards the utopia of the future. We will create a society of total social equality, justice for all, unity among all the working peoples of the world, and where true Communism has been finally achieved, once and for all. The workers of our republic will control their destinies, our scientists will design a new future for humanity, our farmers and agronomists will feed a hungry world, and our brave soldiers will defend the people's revolution, come what may. What began in the salons of Switzerland and the backrooms of Syktyvkar will reach the hearts and minds of all humanity. Utopia is on the horizon, and we will reach it!"
 
 NIK_bukharina_an_economy_of_the_people_desc:0 "The fall of the USSR during the First Patriotic War was, among many other things, caused by the flaws in its economic system. While our predecessors surely tried their best at organizing a socialist economy, in the end they failed due to both technological and ideological limitations.\n\nIf we are to rebuild Russia, we need to create a functional economy, where the citizen receives from the state what he or she needs, and gives in return his loyalty and his work. With such reforms, we'll be one step ahead of our competitors, and we'll create a country both powerful and fair!"
 NIK_bukharina_learning_from_the_past_desc:0 "Despite his faults - and ultimate failure - Bukharin had great ideas and great plans for the Soviet Union. While we intend to surpass him, it would be foolish to simply discard all his work: instead, we'll learn from his reforms, and salvage what good he did so that he may serve the Motherland even after his passing.\n\nBy studying his Siberian Development Plan, focusing on infrastructural innovations and subsidizing light industry, we'll be able to boost our economy and dramatically increase our industrial base, which will greatly benefit both the people and the country as a whole."
 NIK_bukharina_a_union_of_workers_desc:0 "Rather than the German-held industries, where slaves toil and die in both cruel and inefficient ways, we aim to free the worker by granting him not only a fair salary, but the knowledge he needs to improve both his standing and his productivity.\n\nIf we instruct our factory crews on the latest advancements in industrial production methods, we'll create a loyal and skilled workforce, and make a great leap forward in our quest to save Mother Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_and_a_union_of_peasants_desc:0 "One of the greatest mistakes of the Soviet Union was its excessive reliance on industrial cities. The people need to eat as much as they need in order to be both healthy and loyal, and in the larger scheme of things, a famine can be as much as a catastrophe as any military defeat.\n\nBy providing our farmers with modern machinery subsidized by the state, and teaching them how to properly use and maintain them, agricultural output will increase tenfolds. An army marches on its stomach, and this is valid for countries too!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_special_developmental_commission_desc:0 "Russia is vast, and there are large swathes of land full of yet untapped potential. Natural resources waiting to be exploited, fertile land abandoned, and broken infrastructure can be found all across the Motherland, and even within the part that we control.\n\nBy establishing a commission tasked with the individuation and development of such areas is of paramount importance if we are to establish ourselves as serious contenders for the unification of Russia: failure won't be tolerated, nor forgiven!"
 NIK_bukharina_urban_industrial_development_desc:0 "Our cities have been hit hard by the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent German bombings. Thousands of people live in huts as their homes have been destroyed, and damaged power lines and industrial machinery jeopardize our production efforts.\n\nWithout industry, there is no Soviet Union, which means that we have to restore our cities and industrial hubs to their former glory. Repairing urban areas, restoring electric power and kickstarting our industry will slowly but surely bring us back into shape, and the people will surely appreciate it."
 NIK_bukharina_integrate_regional_infrastructure_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, many warlords and disloyal officers have claimed pieces of Russia as their own. Throughout the years, roads, railroads and power lines were disrupted, repaired, sabotaged, rebuilt and destroyed again by a variety of different actors: as a result, emergency repairs and lack of standardization plague our country and cripple our economy.\n\nBy instituting a new and uniform set of standards - especially in rail gauge - we'll be able to slowly integrate the infrastructures scattered across Komi, and it will be a starting point for our future endeavors should we be able to expand and reclaim the lost lands of the Soviet Union."
 NIK_bukharina_rural_agricultural_development_desc:0 "Now that we have set the basis by teaching our farmers about the modern agricultural production methods, we can bring this a step forward by establishing a concerted development effort for our farmlands.\n\nBy subsidizing larger infrastructures such as aqueducts and irrigation channels, that individual farmers would never be able to affort, we can not only increase our agricultural output, but also foster a sense of gratitude among those who will benefit from our efforts. We serve Mother Russia through its people!"
 NIK_bukharina_resource_extraction_initiatives_desc:0 "With our preliminary investments completed, we can now start a serious resource extraction program. Newer infrastructure and improved working methods are a nice start, but in the end they can't change the situation on their own: the state needs to intervene with more subsidies.\n\nBy granting our mines with state funds to buy the latest extraction machines, and directly linking our railroad system to each production facility, we'll increase efficiency across the board, speeding up extraction and cutting the costs. We need everything we can get to save Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_industrial_farming_methods_desc:0 "We have already done much for our agricultural sector, but we can do even more. Our Motherland is cold in weather, but warm in maternal instinct: if we want to truly rebuild Russia, we must care for everyone, and providing food is the first and essential step.\n\nTo this end, we shall increase investments into farming machinery, build even more advanced and dedicated infrastructure, and employ the latest technologies in seed selection and intensive farming. By our effort, we shall turn every corner of our land into verdant fields!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_ideal_synthesis_desc:0 "Finally, our efforts are bringing results. Industrial and agricultural production have increased by several orders of magnitude, and the people thank us for their newly-found prosperity: our lands have been healed from the scars inflicted by war, and we have recovered from our backward methods.\n\nHowever, this isn't enough.\n\nThe Soviet Union we desire does not follow, it leads! We can't be satisfied with copying what others invented, therefore we shall return to the forefront of innovation: our scientists and engineers will work without rest to discover newer and more advanced production methods, so that we may forever be one step aheads of our rivals, both inside and outside Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_soviet_education_system_desc:0 "One of the greatest changes the Soviet Union brought was free basic education for all. Under the Tzars, peasants weren't allowed to study in order to keep them forever under the nobles' thumb: with education comes innovation, and with innovation comes power!\n\nSadly, twenty years of civil strife and German bombings have destroyed the old education system in both a physical and metaphorical sense. With schools razed to the ground, and children forced to work to feed themselves and their families, learning has become a secondary, or even tertiary concerns.\n\nWe shall no longer tolerate such injustice! Our children need to learn so that they may improve both themselves and Mother Russia: we shall rebuild the old schools, and teach a new generation of young boys and girls the value of culture, and through it, how to be an outstanding Soviet citizen!"
 NIK_bukharina_experimental_curricula_desc:0 "The traditional teaching methods and subjects are fine for elementary schools. Superior education, however - especially universities - needs to adapt to the new times, or we risk stagnation.\n\nBy introducing new study courses, and experimental curricula, we can revolutionize our education and help our students find what they excel at. Revolutionary minds produce revolutionary ideas, and the Soviet Union is the very embodiment of the concept of revolution!"
 NIK_bukharina_expand_vocational_schools_desc:0 "Vocational schools teach young students with clear ideas about their future all about a single craft. While entrenched intellectuals consider them somewhat inferior to traditional universities, we are not as blind as them: from their classes come the next generations of artisans, engineers, farmers and bureaucrats, professions upon which lay the very foundation of a country!\n\nWe shall increase foundings to vocational schools, and give those brave boys and girls the best possible education. With it, they will be able to excel, and through it, they will elevate the Soviet Union to new heights of innovation and power: we all serve the Union, and we all deserve the best for it!"
 NIK_bukharina_an_innovative_union_desc:0 "Gone are the days of decadence and backwardness. Gone are the fields tended by farmers and the factories where workers toiled with obsolete farmers. Gone are the child-workers and the empty classrooms. This is a new Russia, a new Union, where progress, for both the nation and the people, reigns supreme.\n\nWe have done so much, but we still have much more to do. The past is no longer stalking us, and now we are the ones chasing the future: new investments in science and education will send us barreling into a new era of progress!"

 NIK_bukharina_restore_the_red_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago."
 NIK_bukharina_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery."
 NIK_bukharina_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_bukharina_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_bukharina_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_bukharina_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_bukharina_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 NIK_bukharina_doctrinal_refinement_desc:0 "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_bukharina_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_bukharina_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 NIK_bukharina_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_bukharina_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_bukharina_the_red_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

 NIK_bukharina_returning_to_the_world_desc:0 "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that Socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 NIK_bukharina_restore_international_trade_desc:0 "The White Sea now lies open to us, and yet we still have no proper fleet to conduct international trade with. The nature of the arctic waters makes this task more difficult than it would seem. The port of Arkhangelsk is almost entirely frozen over during the winter months, and thus our merchant marine will require a specialized fleet of icebreakers to clear a path through to our trade partners.\n\nAccording to our foreign office, the nations of Scandinavia are already quite receptive to our offers of establishing trade. Due to their close proximity to our ports, they would be a relatively hassle-free journey for our merchant fleets as long as they are able to circumvent the frigid conditions of the White Sea."
 NIK_bukharina_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc:0 "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 NIK_bukharina_contact_the_OFN_desc:0 "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the Socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 NIK_bukharina_the_gateway_to_europe_desc:0 "Europe lies under a steel wall of Fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 NIK_bukharina_the_swedish_diplomatic_mission_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_bukharina_approach_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 NIK_bukharina_an_english_embassy_desc:0 "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the Fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 NIK_bukharina_open_the_rykov_conference_desc:0 "The Soviet Union was once the bulwark of the global Socialist cause, sponsoring their comrades from around the world no matter where they came from. Ever since the collapse, however, this mantle has gone unclaimed for nearly two decades. With a Socialist government restored to West Russia, we must regain the initiative.\n\nThe idea has been floated of holding a conference in Rykov in the interest of fostering relations with Socialist parties from across the globe and reaffirming our commitment to the international worker. Representatives from hundreds of countries would be invited to attend, and discuss how to proceed with advancing our mutual goals. This conference will hopefully reestablish our government as the preeminent Socialist power and a friend to the workers of the world."
 NIK_bukharina_propose_the_socintern_desc:0 "The Rykov Conference was a good first step to reestablishing solidarity with fellow Socialists from around the world, but we can go even farther. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Socialist International has been proposed. Like the ComIntern that came before it, the SocIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the SocIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"

 NIK_bukharina_the_path_to_liberation_desc:0 "Despite the odds, we have managed to liberate West Russia and West Siberia! Our people cheer in the streets, for they know that freedom and prosperity is at hand. While we will undoubtedly have to work to ensure that West Siberia is fully integrated into our government, it seems that the sun shines on Bukharina's ideals. We must not falter now, for we must continue onwards towards utopia!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_triumphant_reforms_desc:0 "While we were able to enact some reforms after the unification of West Russia, there was still much doubt about Bukharina as a leader that prevented her from enacting the full breadth of her plans. With the successful reclamation of West Siberia, many of the doubts about Bukharina have been swept away, allowing her to push onwards. The time has come to begin enacting further reforms to push the people closer into a truly socialist society. These reforms will include ensuring equality for all, investigating the necessity of the familial unit, and ensuring that traditionalism's influence in society is greatly weakened. We shall ensure that the Soviet Union is a utopia for all!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_value_of_equality_desc:0 "Any socialist will talk about equality. Question them, and they shall go on about the equality of man to woman, of Russian to Indian, and so on. However, what is much rarer is the socialist that backs up said values with actions. All too common is the socialist who will state their belief in gender equality, just to turn around and deprive women of their rights. We must break this cycle by not only espousing the values of equality, but by supporting those who have been wronged by traditionalist culture. No longer will women have to languish because they are supposedly inferior, and no longer will ethnic minorities have to suffer from racism here in Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_introduce_the_creches_desc:0 "Family is a complex issue. While familial ties have always been the core of society, the fact remains that many bad traditions and inequalities are passed down through them. In order to rectify this, we have begun an experimental program in which children will be raised communally. This communal raising, called creches, will be the forefront of the experiments on if phasing out contemporary families is possible and feasible. We will keep this program opt-in and small for now, as we are not sure if the creche system is superior to the family system. Socialism is about moving forward, in the end, if the creches succeed, we will be able to move forward from the outdated system of families!"
 NIK_bukharina_a_place_for_the_family_desc:0 "While the family may have its issues, dissolving the family is more trouble than it's worth, as the cohesion and support it provides to a society is unmatched by communal child-raising. The better option is to promote egalitarian relations within a family. The wife does not have to stay at home, as she has every right to go to work. Furthermore, children, as they grow into adults, are not obligated to listen to the every command of their parents. By promoting egalitarian ideals within the family, we can hopefully break the traditionalist cycles nestled within, allowing for the revolutionary potential of a family to truly shine through."
 NIK_bukharina_strike_down_traditionalism_desc:0 "In the chaos of the Russian anarchy, the people turned to traditionalism and religion. Now that we have ended warlordism in the west, we have to show the people the trappings of said traditionalism. It may seem beneficial to stick to the ancient truths, but it is those very truths that stagnate society. We shall use the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation in order to help uplift the people to a modern socialist ideal!"
 NIK_bukharina_encourage_experimentalism_desc:0 "We must encourage experimentalist art amongst our people. For far too long, artists have stuck to the old ways because they are old. While the classics of art may be beautiful, they are not the only way to acquire beauty in art. It is time for the people to broaden their horizons so that they are not bound by the chains of conservative antiquity!"
 NIK_bukharina_foundations_of_the_peoples_society_desc:0 "It seems that our social reforms have begun to bear fruit. More and more, people treat others with respect, as compared to the contempt they would have before. However, just because our reforms are working, doesn't mean we can merely stop now. We must always keep moving forward so that we can create an ideal socialist society!"
 NIK_bukharina_making_the_peace_desc:0 "While we have stamped out most organized resistance to our rule, there are still rabble rousers who seek to revolt against our regime and undo our social reforms. We must task the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation to preserve the order, and ensure that we do not become unstable!"
 NIK_bukharina_continue_land_expropriation_desc:0 "A surprising problem we have run into during our consolidation of West Siberia is the issue of land. Many peasants own a pittance of land at best, while landlords are worryingly common. We must rectify this by distributing all land in West Siberia so that the people have the land they need in order to survive and prosper!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_universal_soviet_desc:0 "We are all human, in the end. We are all workers, and peasants, and people. There is a certain unity, no matter how much the capitalist says otherwise, that exists between us all. We must show the people the idea of the universal Soviet, that we all work towards a common goal in one grand union!"
 NIK_bukharina_eyes_on_the_unproven_desc:0 "The various governments of West Siberia have not exactly been pro-socialist. Knowing this, and the conclusion that the people have been inoculated against socialism, we must step up our surveillance efforts against the people of West Siberia to prevent them from revolting against us."
 NIK_bukharina_trust_the_peoples_goodwill_desc:0 "The people are not their government. Even if the government was reactionary, the people may very well not be the same. We have to ensure that we accept the people of West Siberia, as opposed to treating them with suspicion. After all, it is trust that helps build a better government."
 NIK_bukharina_the_benevolent_state_desc:0 "More than anything, the state is a critical part of socialist society. It helps provide for the people, and ensure that the freedoms and socialist ideals of the people are upheld. If we must keep a watch on the populace through surveillance to ensure that freedom and socialism is upheld by all, then so be it."
 NIK_bukharina_all_power_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "We must rearrange the government so that it is governed more on a regional level. This primarily means giving power to the regional Soviets. Of course, while we will let them handle their affairs, we must also keep an eye to ensure that the Soviets do not become controlled by reactionaries."
 NIK_bukharina_a_future_to_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Now that the vast majority of our reforms have been completed for now, we can march onwards towards reunifying Russia. Furthermore, we can build a future that we can be proud of, where equality truly exists and the people are happy!"

 NIK_zhdanov_the_march_of_revolutionary_progress_desc:0 "For years we have struggled under the reign of the counterrevolutionary and the Luddite, who find comfort in the darkness of ignorance. Yet now, years after Russia's collapse into a dark age of ignorance, we stand upon the brink of a brave new era, marching onwards into the light! No more shall the reactionaries keep us chained to infighting and petty warlordism! We shall craft a new Russia from the ashes of the old, ascending to achieve the Soviet superculture!\n\nThe antiquated democracies and dictatorships shall melt away before the grandeur of ultravisionary socialism, the only true path forward for our nation and our species. First, however, we must prepare for the push to retake Siberia from the regressives who claim to be the rightful leaders of Russia."
 NIK_zhdanov_unity_in_purpose_desc:0 "It will be many years before the Paramount Leader's ultimate vision of a spacefaring multispecies collective is fulfilled, but we are closer than ever to that goal. However, before we take our rightful place amongst the stars, we must first deal with earthly matters. Great swathes of our territory are still controlled by a rival government, preventing the industrialization we need to fund our future and denying those under their rule to participate in the grand collective we are assembling.\n\nBut even worse, the Germans have returned their stolen lands to a state of regressive oppression, forcing the people of Moskowien into a stagnant and repressive hierarchy. We must put an end to their misdeeds and incorporate the peoples of that territory into the supertculture, and to do that, we must restore our control of Siberia's resources."
 NIK_zhdanov_unity_in_ideology_desc:0 "To succeed in our goals, Russia must be totally united, not just in geography, but aligned on the principles of the new Soviet state. Achievement of the superculture requires a complete alignment of the citizenry on all fronts, so that we might transcend our earthly bonds. To facilitate the process of cultural conversion we have prepared a new version of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia in line with the principles outlined by the Paramount Leader, to elucidate the values of ultravisionary socialism. This will ensure that every citizen is mentally prepared for the creation of an intersolar nation."
 NIK_zhdanov_assess_the_reclaimed_territories_desc:0 "We are under no illusions about the difficulties inherent in our venture to create a unifying superculture from the disparate masses of humanity. Still, against all odds we have subsumed millions of individuals into our collective, and now possess a great deal of new territory along with all the resources that come with it.\n\nAbove all, the oil fields we have captured will provide us with power, fuel, and funding for our projects. Our tractors, tanks, and soon our rockets shall run on this black gold, propelling our expansion into the lost territories to the east. The remainder shall be sold to fund our scientific projects, serving the interests of the Soviet people. An administrative committee will be created to evaluate the qualities and uses of this and other resources, and ensure maximum efficiency of our efforts."
 NIK_zhdanov_absorb_the_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_desc:0 "The Sverdlovsk Design Bureau was one of the most effective scientific installations in Western Siberia, established under the purview of Konstantin Rokossovsky, a talented general who was sadly unsuited to the demands of the superculture. However, his creation is responsible for many breakthroughs in the art of modern warfare and the technology needed for it.\n\nA more effective fighting force will be necessary to consolidate the bountiful resources of Russia for our own purposes, and the Sverdlovsk Bureau must be consolidated into the greater structure for the benefit of all."
 NIK_zhdanov_rehabilitate_the_personnel_desc:0 "Scientific minds are not just highly educated and useful, the men who possess them are highly advanced thinkers and the best suited to lead in the days ahead. Most men do not adapt quickly to the new demands of the day, and our leaders must do it most of all. These men must be fellow architects of the superculture, each doing his part to make humanity transcend its limitations and build a brave new world.\n\nWe have recently acquired several scientists from Sverdlovsk whose experience in military applications of sciences will make fine additions to the collective. Prepare to rehabilitate them as ultravisonary leaders. With their expertise, we shall touch the stars."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_ultravisionary_method_desc:0 "The Paramount Leader, and the future of humanity, stands before a critical decision.\n\nWill we seek to establish ourselves as the dominant terrestrial power, eliminating the regressives of Germania and freeing millions of workers to participate in the establishment of our new superculture? Or will we secure our ascendancy by developing technology that would have been unthinkable only mere decades ago, and boldly transgressing the most optimistic expectations of the reactionaries and even our own scientists?\n\nThis choice will determine the distribution of our resources for years to come. In our unification, there can be no half-measures."
 NIK_zhdanov_applied_zhdanovshchina_desc:0 "Ultravisionary socialism must establish itself as the dominant and undisputed power upon this terrestrial body before presenting itself to extraterrestrial beings as a superior mode of society. The superculture cannot be challenged by external forces, especially not in a critical moment of first contact with an unknown civilization. It would drastically reduce our credibility to introduce ourselves as merely another of the powers of our divided world.\n\nAs such, we must prepare operations to weaken those who would see us dragged back into the cave of ignorance, secure all the resources we can from them, and manufacture circumstances so as to achieve dominance over the world. As long as the superculture remains vulnerable to Earth-bound influences, stellar adventures will have to wait."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_way_for_humanity_is_open_desc:0 "Why should a titan meddle with the ants beneath their notice? Germany is divided and weak, a tottering tower on the brink of collapse. Japan is much the same. The West is embroiled in their usual capitalist squabbles. We are above all this petty bickering. The creation and expansion of the superculture should be our concern, above all else.\n\nThis decision will of course have consequences, consequences which are inescapable. Reallocation of our resources to expanding the new frontier will require sacrifices from the Soviet people for the benefit of the whole, as is outlined in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.\n\nThe obsolete governments of the West are bound to the Earth. We are bound for the stars."
 NIK_zhdanov_necessary_material_conditions_desc:0 "독일의 침공은 우리의 발전을 용납할 수 없을 정도로 후퇴시켰고, 새로운 러시아의 가장 큰 약점 중 하나는 국민들의 생활환경입니다. 기반시설은 분리되어 시민들이 도시에 의해 만들어진 망으로부터 단절되었습니다. 농장은 불에 타서 소금에 절여졌고, 인간의 가장 기본적인 욕구를 충족시키는 인구의 능력을 감소시켰습니다.\n\n이것은 소련의 슈퍼 컬쳐에 들어가기 전에, 도저히 용납할 수 없는 상황입니다. 집단의 개별 단위는 완전한 능력을 발휘하도록 기능해야 하며, 우리는 인류를 고양시키기 전에 가장 낮은 것 부터 고양시켜야합니다. 인류의 황폐한 부분 사이의 끊어진 연결 고리는 육체적, 정신적 차원에서 고쳐져야 하며, 우리는 결코 다시 분열되는 것을 허용하지 않아야 합니다!\n\n구시대적 민주주의와 독재정권은 인류와 민족을 위한 진정한 길인 초비전적 사회주의의 웅장함 앞에서 사라지게 될 것입니다. 그러나 먼저 우리는 러시아의 정당한 지도자라고 주장하는 퇴폐 세력으로부터 시베리아를 탈환하기 위한 추진에 대비해야 합니다."
 NIK_zhdanov_observe_cultural_shifts_desc:0 "It is not enough to shape and mold the superculture. The sculptor must monitor his clay, particularly when he works with such materials as the human race, and ensure it is formed and fired properly. Conformity to the principles of the Paramount Leader is to be encouraged, while deviation is to be corrected. Active deviation is to be forcefully corrected.\n\nTo this end, we shall deploy trained architects of the superculture, to monitor every facet of life for the collection of data, obtain feedback on the efficacy of our methods, and detect regressives within our ranks for prompt reeducation. Those who would disrupt the Paramount Leader's plans disrupt the progress of mankind, and shall not be tolerated in any form."
 NIK_zhdanov_society_redefined_desc:0 "From such small beginnings, we have come so far. With the majority of our enemies defeated, the undisputed control of our lands has been solidified. Our fighting forces grow strong on the back of scientific discovery and innovation. Literature and language is putty in our hands, shaped to our benefit. Our brightest minds construct rockets and discuss the spread of socialism across borders, and between the stars.\n\nAnd beyond the stars, our destiny awaits, to show the universe the power of ultravisionary socialism. We shall complete Phase One of Comrade Kardashev's plan for civilization, achieving mastery over our planet, and prove ourselves the heralds of mankind's ascension!\n\nThe superculture shall unite as one, and as one, we go forth."
 NIK_zhdanov_glory_to_the_ones_who_look_forward_desc:0 "레닌의 깃발이 우리 위에 있다.\n우리는 행복을 쌓기 위해 왔다네!\n젊은이의 손으로,\n지구의 전력을 그려나가자!\n\n앞으로 전진하는 자들에게 영광이 있기를!\n우리의 길은 현재에서 눈부신 미래까지라네!\n우리의 길은 현재에서 다음 해까지라네!\n\n젊은이들은 별빛 로켓처럼\n매일 위로 향해 날아오른다!\n조국의 하늘에 맑은 새벽을 밝히겠다!"

 NIK_a_grand_step_forwards_desc:0 "The reborn Soviet Union grows yet stronger, driven onwards by the inexorable currents of history. No amount of fascist violence or particularist deviance can prevent the restoration of the true workers' state. Western Siberia, with its population, industrial hubs and rich agricultural land, is restored to the rightful government of the proletariat. Half of the Motherland is now liberated; we shall begin the process of reintegration and cleaning up the mess that our enemies have made immediately."
 NIK_extend_the_apparatus_desc:0 "Siberia has been deprived of proper socialist governance for too long. The reactionary juntas, criminals and revisionists have left us with a sorry assortment of ineffective bureaucracies and backwards local administrations. This will not do. The people demand that their Siberian brothers and sisters are granted the full benefits of our renewed socialist society - Comrade Suslov shall see that it is done! Soon, cities and villages alike will be filled with smiling workers and peasants, cheering on the advance of the revolution as it reclaims all of Russia."
 NIK_supervise_the_union_desc:0 "Siberia is not as refined and orderly as it should be. Crime, banditry and rebellion continue to blight the land. Such is the natural outcome of societal breakdown and the absence of a strong, ideologically consistent government. The workers demand order and security, and General Secretary Suslov will make it so. Police presence in the region will be increased tenfold. Of course, this will in turn require further expansion of our robust security apparatus - a small, harmless reform that the Party is more than happy to endorse. All Siberians shall rest easy under our constant vigilance."
 NIK_the_heart_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The workers of the world are all equal, but those of Russia were the first to embrace the revolution in its true form and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. Our comrades around the world have sadly forgotten this fact, owing to our defeat at the hands of fascism - but that was merely a temporary setback. The champion of international socialism is risen once more, strong as ever and buoyed aloft by the spirit of solidarity. Now that we are a global player again, we shall spread the good news to every corner of the Earth. Workers, rejoice - for the revolution has returned!"
 NIK_anti_corruption_initiatives_desc:0 "Sadly, despite our efforts to eventually become a post-money society, the allure of wealth remains a potent incentive towards criminal behavior. Corruption, that most capitalist of diseases, threatens to become common practice in our bureaucracy. This state of affairs is unacceptable, but conventional methods have proven ineffective against its spread. Perhaps it is time to fight fire with fire? The promise of financial reward to those willing to inform on corrupt colleagues might do more to curb the problem than any amount of investigations or tribunals."
 NIK_expunge_the_secret_societies_desc:0 "A twin-headed monster lurks, wounded but still alive, in the forests of Siberia. Upon its left shoulder rests the serpentine head of revisionism, hissing falsehoods with a forked tongue and leading workers astray. To its right sits the snarling visage of fascism, muzzle red with the peoples' blood. The beast is the double threat of the Stalinists and the Black League, equally guilty of crimes against socialism, the Motherland and her people. The remnants of these traitors must be expunged from Siberia to make way for sensible, humane socialism, that the wounds of the nation might be bound and healed."
 NIK_a_hand_to_the_khrushchevites_desc:0 "Even the splitters have splitters. The so-called Stalinists find themselves divided between those loyal to the chauvinist, reactionary Frankensteinian ideas of Kaganovich, and the more orthodox and progressive clique of Khrushchev. The latter still differ from our established Party line to a worrying degree, but perhaps we can return them to the correct path. Lenient, perhaps - but Khrushchev is a charismatic and popular man who commands great respect within the Party, especially from those with more forward-thinking tendencies."
 NIK_increase_socintern_funding_desc:0 "Russia is a fount of natural resources, giving us significant economic clout on the global stage. We can easily rake in billions from trade, and Comrade Suslov has exactly the right idea for where these righteous profits should be directed: the Socialist International. Failure to cooperate with the international proletariat has been the death of many a promising revolution, and we shall not repeat that mistake. The workers of the world will be united, and Soviet roubles will make it happen."
 NIK_repress_potential_deviants_desc:0 "The rise of another Bukharina or Zhdanov is a possibility we cannot abide. Despite their dedication to socialism, those two splitters frequently endangered the cause with selfish factionalism, setting a dangerous precedent for future generations. The Party cannot allow ideological deviance to become normalized. We must be on the lookout for any potential splitters rising through the ranks, that we might snuff out their ambitions and maintain socialism as Marx and Lenin intended it."
 NIK_accept_the_young_planners_desc:0 "Though many of the younger generation born after the time of Lenin and Bukharin tend towards unorthodox thought, they are not lost to us. They are like awkward teenagers getting a feel for their pubescent bodies, full of questions and confusion. On occasion, they glean some great insight amidst the chaos of change and become agents of socialism's future development. By vetting their ideas and encouraging growth rather than simply suppressing them outright, we can cultivate the next generation of great socialist thinkers. Someday, the current leaders of the proletariat will be gone; learned, intelligent and innovative successors will be needed to take their place."
 NIK_reform_party_membership_desc:0 "Membership of the Communist Party should mean something more than what it currently does. As-is, it seems that true believers are outnumbered by career bureaucrats seeking advancement. We are the vanguard of the socialist revolution, not a means by which ambitious men can put themselves above their comrades! Party membership should be accompanied with a set of obligations and standards to strengthen our legitimacy as the representatives of the proletariat. Those who fail to meet expectations will be expelled so that someone more deserving and reliable can take their place."
 NIK_emphasize_anti_imperialism_desc:0 "Make no mistake; the capitalist West is no friend to the proletariat. Even if fascism is the greater evil, it was capitalism's failings that led to its creation in the first place. That they now quarrel with one another is no concern to us. We know our path and will follow it; it shall never be a lonely one, for we have the workers of all nations by our side. We shall loudly and unequivocally condemn all imperialism, be it born of fascism or capitalism, for ultimately they differ only in their methods."
 NIK_a_strategic_orientation_desc:0 "We must face facts: the Soviet Union is not in a position to pick a fight with the West. They may be oppressive imperialists, but it was the Germans and their allies who invaded the Motherland and drove us from our homes. One does not look to the distant wolf when the bear is breaking down the door. Though the Americans can never be trusted so long as their corrupt kleptocratic institutions remain, aligning ourselves with the greater cause of defeating fascism is the responsible course of action."
 NIK_the_international_vanguard_desc:0 "Long have we waited for this day. There are those who said it would never come, that the revolution was finished; what have they to say now? The people and workers of the Soviet Union are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. Fascists, revisionists and reactionaries fall before us like wheat before the scythe! Nothing can defeat the courage and resolve of a united proletariat, mighty and invincible! Today, Siberia; tomorrow, the hills of Manchuria!"

 NIK_zhdanov_the_atomic_age_desc:0 "In the darkness of collapse, it seemed inevitable that we should never be restored to an equal footing with the nuclear powers. Yet in the end, only Russians could master Russia, and marshal her vast resources to any meaningful end. We shall split the atom and demonstrate to the world our overwhelming scientific prowess."
 NIK_zhdanov_uranium_extraction_efforts_desc:0 "Uranium is not an optional material in our nuclear experiments. Fortunately, our expansion into Western Siberia has granted us the resources we need.

We must take whole cities, devote them entirely to our scientific progress, and close them to all non-approved individuals. Security is paramount, and doubly so when dealing in nuclear secrets."
 NIK_zhdanov_absorb_compatible_elements_desc:0 "The old nuclear weapons program was started by Bukharin's regime, and while not devoted to the same ultravisionary principles as us, many of the scientists will be willing and able to participate in our own program. We should make every possible effort to entice them into our service. Our supremacy lies ahead!"

This will serve two valuable purposes. First, development of rocket technology will allow us to project power and ensure the primacy of the superculture with nuclear weapons. Second, the development of spaceflight technology shall bring us ever closer to the stars, and the ultimate progress of ultravisionary socialism."
 NIK_zhdanov_social_sphere_permeation_desc:0 "It is not enough to extol the values of the superculture as a concept. We must make sure that every citizen is made aware of our goals at an unconscious level, and that every aspect of our society is immersed in the values of ultravisionary socialism."

Russia was broken into pieces, and now, in the crucible of reunification, we shall forge a superculture to stand the test of time. None shall stand in the way of our ascendance- not the capitalist decadence of the west, nor the oppressive fascists of Germany, nor the atavistic banditry of the warlord years. United in our goals, we march forward in lockstep, to the destinations that only ultravisionaries can perceive.\n\nFor what is a single voice, compared to a magnificent chorus?"

 andropov.1.t:0 "Another Late Night in Syktyvkar"
 andropov.1.d:0 "Yuri Andropov sighed as he lazily tapped the butt of his cigarette against the ashtray, watching with no real interest as the ashes drifted to the bottom of the small glass container. Yet another late night at the office. The light patter of rain against the window drew his eyes to the dark, muggy streets of Syktyvkar outside. He rose to his feet and brought the cigarette to his lips as he surveyed the city. It was quiet tonight; too quiet for his tastes.\n\nSometimes, young members of the communist party, whispering in each other's ears without a care in the world, would comment on Mikhail Suslov's secrecy - his paranoia. The Party was a safe place, they'd whine. They were all comrades there, right? Perhaps he could just loosen up a little.\n\nUsually they'd shut up when Yuri tapped them on the shoulder and asked them if they wanted to share their opinions with the class. Then they'd know who the real shadow of the Party was.\n\nAndropov snickered at the memory and shook his head. His job wasn't all just scaring dumb kids - it was to do what needed to be done to ensure Party stability - or to disappear whoever had earned Suslov's ire. The latest list of names to investigate Mikhail had given him was, all things considered, damn boring for the most part; one name, however, caught his attention. Svetlana Bukharina.\n\nHe had met the kid a few times, he remembered, blowing some smoke out onto the window. She spoke like Yuri imagined a princess would, all prim and proper, smiled as she shook his hand, the works. It's how he knew she was dangerous. Her father was like that too. A wonderful man, if you were on his good side - but there was a venom hidden behind his eyes, and he saw that behind hers too.\n\nAs Yuri watched, a bolt of lightning lit up the city. For a moment, it almost seemed like it was on fire. He wondered then if it was a sign of what Svetlana could do.\n\nHe shook his head and tossed the cigarette into the ashtray."
 andropov.1.a:0 "Just another threat, or an unexpected ally?"
 
 andropov.2.t:0 "A Midnight Walk"
 andropov.2.d:0 "Yuri shoved his hands in the pockets of his coat, a vain attempt to keep them warm as he trudged through the downpour. Almost reflexively, his hand curled around the grip of the gun that always sat in his right-hand pocket. He always carried at least two weapons on him. The knife in his boot, and the tokarev in his pocket - you never knew who would be out to silence you in this town.\n\nThings were moving faster these days than they had in years - Lenin was certainly right about that. Sometimes decades happened in the span of weeks. The kid was a goddamned savant at the political game - Bukharina, he corrected himself. In just a few short weeks she'd rapidly moved up in the party and had cemented herself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSomething told Yuri she wouldn't stop rising there. She was like a goddamned force of nature in the party, one that Suslov was growing increasingly worried about - and therein lied Yuri's choice.\n\nGiving her a good word to the General Secretary would keep her safe for a while longer - and Yuri had a feeling she'd capitalize on that. Good investment.\n\nOn the other hand, a part of him said to wait and see. If his feeling about her was right, she'd be able to claw her way to Suslov herself."
 andropov.2.a:0 "Let her fight her own battles."
 andropov.2.b:0 "Put in a good word."

 andropov.3.t:0 "Fighting a Losing Battle"
 andropov.3.d:0 "Yuri Andropov was nothing if not a smart man, he reasoned with himself with some satisfaction; his hunch on Bukharina was certainly a correct one, hell, she had risen far beyond his expectations. Suslov hadn't seemed to worry about her growing beyond control, but Yuri certainly had - and who was right in the end?\n\nA smirk crossed his lips as he trudged home. It had been a very productive meeting with several prominent 'revisionists', as Suslov would have called them. Yuri would have called them smart people. He wasn't exactly a bleeding heart when it came to how to best implement Socialism, but he was a smart man.\n\nThese people were, whether he personally liked it or not, the future. Bukharina - hell, even Zhdanov, to some extent - they were the ones who were going to lead the Party to the future, not Suslov. Though they may have initially distrusted him as a hardliner, they certainly didn't after tonight.\n\nAndropov chuckled to himself. The game was afoot, and he certainly intended to pick a winning side."
 andropov.3.a:0 "Out with the old."

 andropov.4.t:0 "Check"
 andropov.4.d:0 ""- I've seen the way the tide's turning, Comrade. There's no future in the past - but there is one with you."\n\nSvetlana Bukharina's eyebrow raised.\n\n"While I'm glad you've seen the light, Comrade Andropov, you'll need for forgive me for my disbelief. You served as Suslov's attack dog for years. How can I trust you?"\n\nAndropov shrugged. He expected the suspicion, and he had come prepared. From within his overcoat pocket he withdrew a small pocketbook and held it out to the woman. As she opened it, her eyes widened, and Yuri couldn't help but smile.\n\n"All of your opponents' dirty little secrets. Things that'd surely turn the party against them if they somehow leaked."\n\n"Comrade Andropov, I have the feeling this will be the start of a very beneficial friendship for the both of us."\n\n"I hope so, Comrade Bukharina. I hope so.""
 andropov.4.a:0 "Almost there."

 andropov.5.t:0 "Checkmate"
 andropov.5.d:0 ""-... And in your capacities as head of the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation, your duties will include ensuring the immediate cessation of counter-revolutionary activity wherever it may rear its' ugly head, ensuring the safety of the Soviet State, and keeping the people safe from all other hidden threats. Do you understand, Comrade Andropov?"\n\nYuri smiled. "I do, Comrade Bukharina."\n\nThis was it, then. The bet he had made such a long time ago in Syktyvkar had finally paid off. From fixer to intelligence director. Not a bad career path, if he said so himself.\n\n"Good," Bukharina continued. "Then I believe we're done here."\n\nYuri moved to exit her office. "And Yuri?" She spoke as he left. He turned to face her, surprised to see a genuine smile spread across her face.\n\n"Good luck."\n\nHe returned the smile with one of his own. Somewhere along the line they'd actually became friends, it seemed.\n\n"You too, Comrade. You too.""
 andropov.5.a:0 "Another win."
 

 bukharina.1.t:0 "The Victory of Reform"
 bukharina.1.d:0 "As she approached the microphone, Svetlana Bukharina suppressed a nervous tremble. It had finally happened. She had finally achieved what she had set out to do so long ago.\n\nAfter years spent in obscurity, after more spent concealing her ambitions from those who saw her as useful only for her name, and after yet more spent in the consolidation of Western Russia, she, and through extension the people, had triumphed. And she had no intention, of allowing the opportunities now offered to be wasted.\n\nWatching the technician carefully, she began speaking the moment he indicated that the microphone was active. She began by speaking of triumph, by thanking all those listening for their efforts - and sacrifices - in support of the state's victory. Very quickly, however, she moved to speak of what the future held. Of how she intended to change their lives for the better.\n\nSocialism, she said, rested at the natural apex of political thought, for it combined economic progress and collective human care. But all too often it had not been implemented in proper fashion. By her predecessors. By other so-called revolutionary states. By, she said with regret, of her father's Union. She intended to correct this.\n\nProgressive economic and social policies were to be soon introduced, and those obstructing such reform would be swept aside. Equality, of all kinds, would be emphasized, continuing the legacy of some who had come long before and ensuring that Russia was known as a champion of equitable action.\n\nChange, she promised those listening, was imminent. They needed only to watch, and reap the rewards besides."
 bukharina.1.a:0 "A new day for true socialism."
 
 bukharina.2.t:0 "The Selection Process"
 bukharina.2.d:0 "Bukharina is a woman of measured and deliberate tones, but the exhaustion in her voice is all too real as she begins the announcement. So, too, is her triumph. The Congress of the Soviets has been formed, the long struggle over who to select and who to reject for the Presidium finished. It is coming to a close, at long last, and the business of real governance can truly begin.\n\nHer hand trembles as she reads aloud the words, each blending into the next, and the Congress registers her candidates with polite and faceless nods. A unionist here. A politician there. A general or two thrown in for diversity's sake. She can't quite remember the specifics of everything anymore - her head is trembling with the effort necessary to stand as it is - but what she does know is that while she was still lucid, she had taken measures to build the broadest possible base.\n\nShe will not repeat the mistakes of her father. Never again will Russia crumble from the errors of a few.\n\nShe stumbles, almost trips and falls. Panic echoes through the Congress, and guards stand to help her up. She waves them off - a leader always stands up before her people, she thinks - and resumes reading. A police officer, one of the few good ones, she thinks, and she's finished at last. Polite applause comes as her speech ends. She staggers out of the podium, stumbles into her seat and takes a long, long swing of the devil's brew.\n\nShe barely has time to let it down her throat when the first rejection comes. The unionist is a good choice, yes, but according to the remarks he made to a speech in so-and-so factory, his allegiances to independent unionism are rather in doubt. And as for his own capacities to build the Revolution, has the Chairwoman not noticed his work with so-and-so employers?\n\nBukharina stares blearily into the Congress, head unbowed. Something raw and primal inside her wants to burst into a long, silent scream, and in the spaces of her head, she indulges it."
 bukharina.2.a:0 "I hate bureaucracy."

 bukharina.3.t:0 "Soviet Humanism"
 bukharina.3.d:0 "Despite the many questions being asked of him, the professor remained patient and composed. He could not blame the students for their confusion. After all, like them, he too had been removed from academia for many, many years, having only returned with the imposition of renewed order.\n\nAs he answered another such question, he took care to emphasize the importance of the 'Soviet' in the all-important concept of Soviet Humanism. The distinction was critical, he announced to the lecture hall, and could not be overlooked, at least if one were to truly understand the system.\n\nHumanism, he declared, was well-understood to represent the belief in promotion of human agency, and of the inherent value of every human being. But it had also traditionally been defined through a non-socialist lens, with the position of that agency within hierarchies - political or ecclesiastical - being a subject of intense focus. And this acceptance of such a social construct was inherently divisive. Inherently destructive.\n\nSoviet Humanism accounted for this, and in doing so, elevated the philosophy tremendously. By eliminating religious considerations, emphasizing egalitarian social policy, and reorienting the lens from external hierarchies and factors to internal improvement, within both the individual and the state as a whole, it promised progress on a scale never before seen.\n\nIt promised to, truly and finally, place humanity at the forefront of thought. Who, the professor asked, could possibly argue against such a goal? With conviction of any kind?\n\nAt that, there were no more questions."
 bukharina.3.a:0 "An achievable goal?"

 bukharina.4.t:0 "In All Things, Equal"
 bukharina.4.d:0 "Occasionally, when Marianna had the time and her overseer wasn't looking, she'd slip away to a place she knew: the industrial floodlights shone on almost everything, but they hid certain alleys with their bulk just as easily. There she would read, page after page, the works that kept her alive. Her parents had died young, and all she'd known as she grew to adulthood was this: fluorescent lighting, endless queues of machinery and the quiet sorrow of being alive.\n\nBut Kollontai's words kept her going. There was a fire in them, an inexpressible celebration, that let Marianna know who she really was: in her words, for the first time in what had been an otherwise utterly unnoticed life, she felt heard. When her supervisor ignored her pleas for paid overtime, when her colleagues snickered at her slower pace and tentative moves, when she was tired, abandoned and so alone it hurt -\n\nShe would run to her hiding place, flip to the page, so well-browsed it was fastened to the spine by sheer willpower, and read the words, "Certainly not the woman worker. She is her own savior. Her future is in her own hands." She read it over and over and over again. Occasionally tears would slip out and dry on the smoothed, weathered paper, like little blossoms. Then she would return to her workplace, her pain seemingly cast aside.\n\nWhen the Soviet Representative came to the factory, she was ready. Scarcely had the words Marxist Feminism flowed from the Representative's mouths when she rose to speak, talking almost too fast for comprehension. She spoke of the need of her fellow workers to fight alongside her, not undercut her position, and as she spoke she almost wept with the relief.\n\nIn the silence that followed, she packed her things with trembling hands left the factory. For the first time in years, she knew what she had to do. She began walking, not quite sure where she would go but certain she was headed for a better place."

 bukharina.5.t:0 "A Principled Response To Gender Revisionism"
 bukharina.5.d:0 "Socialist Workers! We have heard the cries of the Revisionist in our struggle to build a world for the Dignity of the Proletarian. The Revisionist says one of three things; FIRST, that women are physically incapable; SECOND, that women are emotionally hysterical; THIRD, that to embrace equality would ruin our traditions. Let us consider the following:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we argue that women are NO MORE physically incapable than are men! Women are rarely seen in manual labor because they have NOT been given the chance to work outside the home; indeed, raising a home with little support from a husband can be oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we reply that women are, far from hysterical, the more composed sex. Was Hitler not a male? It was under the charge of MALE leaders, not female, that the world was swept in war and horror; and it was under the Bourgeois Dictatorship of the Intellect that the world LEARNED to associate Maleness with Wisdom, and Femaleness with Chaos. This is oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we retort that the same traditions that give Russia its 'values' have led it into error, again and again! Because Russia loved the Tsar, it SLAVERED before his gaze and expected reprieve from the First War, and was shocked when the Tsar answered their begging with BULLETS. Because Russia loved tradition, it hesitated when the clarion call came to build itself up with the rest of the World, and for it, we were CRUSHED as Hitler's savages came for us. Our infatuation with tradition will lead us to embrace only the GRAVE!\n\nComrades! You have heard the call for Revolution - let us obey, and fight to the end against all the shackles that Reactionism imposes upon us! Modernity, and the Classless Future, awaits the brave!"
 bukharina.5.a:0 "Reject Tradition! Embrace Modernity!"

 bukharina.6.t:0 "A Principled Response To The Crypto-Orthodox"
 bukharina.6.d:0 "Socialist Workers! We have heard the cries of the hidden Counter-Revolutionaries that call themselves NICODEMITES, the hidden Christians. The Nicodemite claims three defenses: FIRST, that the Orthodox Church must be preserved to keep Russia blessed by God; SECOND, that the Church contains many within its walls that are innocent; THIRD, that the tearing down of churches will destroy our cultural heritage. Let us consider:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we respond that the so-called 'PRESERVATION' of Russia's Church led to its near defeat in the Great War, and has done nothing for us since the release of the SERFS! Religion is an OPIATE of the masses, and our duty as class-conscious workers is to WAKE the masses from their drugged slumber. For that is worth any amount of forfeited 'blessings'!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we demand a retraction of this INSULT to our workers. Our Workers' Battalions are imbued with the most HUMANE of class values, and would gladly give their lives for the defense of the INNOCENT. They attack only the hidden predators of the working class, who ABSCOND with the wealth of the masses in the name of religion! Those who are not enemies of the workers have nothing to fear!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we call only for a demonstration of the so-called VALUES these Churches preserve! Do the accumulated wealth and power accrued by the PRIESTS not indicate that, far from being our moral guardians, the Church has in fact acted as our collective RACKETEERS? Let us be AWARE, comrades! The Church cares nothing for tradition, nor for the soul - unless one's soul is contained within one's WALLET!\n\nComrades! The State has called for Revolution, and let us unceasingly vie to outdo each other in zeal to fulfil the mandate! Destroy the strength of this accumulated REACTIONARY force, and let the Revolution emerge as our true and better Salvation!"

Consider:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we have only SCORN for the fools and dullards who believe these women are not COERCED. The reactionary apparatus HYPNOTIZES innocent women into SELF-VICTIMHOOD - that is precisely why they struggle with us when we RIP the illusions from their faces! Let us ceaselessly destroy their illusions - when they come to their senses, they will THANK us.\n\nTO THE SECOND, we are UTTERLY CONTEMPTUOUS of the idea that these so-called "swinging Socialists" would ever be pure enough for the REVOLUTION in the First Place. Our creed calls for the SELF-CRITICISM of every aspect of their reactionary lives, and yet it is the removal of some SENSELESS VEILS that destroys the fabric of their communities! Only their extirpation and assimilation into the Enlightened Proletariat will suffice for an answer.\n\nTO THE THIRD, we answer only with DISGUST! If you have not understood that Socialism demands the total extinction of reactionary traditions, you have understood NOTHING about Socialism at all! For these senseless fools it is worse to work with than to fight, for they will actively undermine your cause: RESIST them and DRAG them to their SENSES!\n\nNo matter if the Government disagrees with us, the Immortal SCIENCE of Marxism shows us the WAY!"

 bukharina.9.t:0 "Housekeeping"
 bukharina.9.d:0 "The Working World had not been easy on Officer Tabashnikov. Life in the Republican Police had been a constant struggle from beginning to end - struggles against internal corruption, struggles with his bosses over funding and manpower, struggles with the men on the street who didn't understand that he was doing what he was doing to keep them safe. Of course, the rabble didn't know how much it cost, or the sleepless nights he endured, but that was why they were rabble, weren't they?\n\nIt came as a dull surprise to him when the Revolution reached his home in scarlet banners, but he supposed he'd gotten lucky. There had been little that changed: he reported now to a Commissar instead of a Boss, and his deputies greeted each other with Comrade instead of their first names, and there was talk of hiring a woman - a woman! - in the branch someday. Nothing else had changed. Why would it?\n\nEverything began to crumble when the order came in from Central. President's orders were to release everything in a comprehensible format. Nice, safe and orderly. Well, Tabashnikov knew then that he had to be the one to review his own records. It was the only way to preserve his skin - and his service to the people. Too much lay in the balance to risk it. He gave strict orders to his secretary to lock the records down and left for the weekend, to settle accounts.\n\nHe forgot, of course, that his deputies had been appointed to the task as well - and that they had been granted equal access with the very same decree that had opened the records.\n\nAs Tabashnikov returned, he found his deputies staring at him with something between disgust, fear and pity on their faces - and a cold-faced bureaucrat with a very, very unamused expression. He began to wonder if the jail cell would have hot or cold running water - very soon, he suspected, his hide would be too whipped to tell."

Life in the Republican Police had been a constant struggle from beginning to end - struggles against internal corruption, struggles with his bosses over funding and manpower, struggles with the men on the street who didn't understand that he was doing what he was doing to keep them safe. Of course, the rabble didn't know how much it cost, or the sleepless nights he endured, but that was why they were rabble, weren't they?\n\nIt came as a dull surprise to him when the Revolution reached his home in scarlet banners, but he supposed he'd gotten lucky. There had been little that changed: he reported now to a Commissar instead of a Boss, and his deputies greeted each other with Comrade instead of their first names, and there was talk of hiring a woman - a woman! - in the branch someday. Nothing else had changed. Why would it?\n\nWhen the order came in to conduct a "sober and thorough" review of internal events, Tabashnikov knew exactly what he had to do. He'd done too much to risk it all, but it wouldn't matter if his own subordinates proved a weak link. He spoke quietly with his deputies and secretaries, offering the one incentive he knew would work without question. They left with their hearts a little emptier, but their wallets more than adequately compensated.\n\nThe fire in the dumpster that evening would never be officially explained, nor would the sudden disappearance of certain...sensitive documents that were later deemed unnecessary to routine law-enforcement work.

Assured, by the Chief of the Police, that they posed no threat to our security. What was I given for my assurance?" She placed another binder upon the table; this one landed like a feather, but none dared look at its contents - precisely because they already knew what it was.\n\nThe President moved past the dizzying heights of rage and took flight into the rarefied heights of cold, calm fury. The room fell even more silent than it had previously been. Several staffers made motions to escape for a toilet break, fleeing at the minutest of nods.\n\n"I am only going to ask this once. Can I be assured that no such attacks will happen again?" The Chief of Police's averted gaze told her all she needed to know. "Very well. I had wanted to avoid this unpleasantry, but we cannot afford to have this despoil the Revolution. Gather the Directorate for Revolutionary Preservation and call the Head of the Presidium to my office."\n\nUpon her lips was affixed something that looked like a smile, and yet was so utterly constricted it looked more like a particularly painful rictus. Her secretary nodded, only barely suppressing her trembling, and made a careful note upon her calendar.\n\n"You are dismissed. Do not return unless I call." As the gathered staff dispersed into the depths of the Chamber, Bukharina collapsed into herself, listening only to the guilt that burrowed deep into her heart and cradling her tea-flask."

What they did next would make them all monsters in equal measures. There would be blood enough to share.\n\nClearing her throat, she rose to speak. "I have called you here today in view of your oath. When you were sworn into office in your capacities, I asked of you the strength and resolve to defend the Revolution by any means necessary. Even if it meant a suspension of - formalities and conventions that others could afford, but we could not."\n\nShe looked down. "That moment has now arrived."\n\nAgain she looked up, and the doubt was gone. Iron, and the fire that lit it, were all that remained. "We had previously agreed to an informal armistice with the Suslovite and Zhdanovite elements in our Republic and legislature, for the sake of the Nation and the Revolution we embodied. This armistice is henceforth suspended. All necessary measures are to be taken to remove them - social circles and sympathizers are to be considered complicit."\n\nA tentative voice rose from the rear. "Are you suggesting the use of unlimited interrogation?"\n\nUnder Bukharina's desk, a hand-knotted and torn strip of paper was kneaded and thrown aside. On it was written the term: REPRIEVE?\n\n"All necessary measures.""

In the blackest hours of the morning, when only cleaning crews and the on-duty URS agents were present, they always shone so beautifully - a perfect complement to the friendly smell of the teacup on her desk, and the sweet, romantic jazz that the record player was playing. In her way, this was her personal paradise - alone, peaceful, and victorious, lounging in her chair in a way that she would never allow to be photographed. It was the calmest part of the week - the time that she had to herself, to sit in her solitary office and get a few minutes of reflection and relaxation.\n\nMoving her feet off of the desk's surface, and swiveling the chair around, she looked back out the half-shuttered window once more. In the distance, red fireworks were being fired off - celebrations by her supporters, no doubt, of the final neutralization of the sadly misguided opposition. Their own Victory Day. It was a gesture she approved of, privately. Celebration, making a positive example - those who tragically resisted progress would eventually come around, exposed to the joy and community of true progressive society. Repression past a certain point would merely lead their ideals to form their metaphorical fortresses.\n\nShe took a sip of tea and closed her eyes, moving a single finger in the air as if conducting the music. Finally, she thought, the first phase of her work had been a success - everything was working just as it should be."

I knew from the way you spoke, as if half your body was in some far-off realm high above, that you were involved in something that I dared not name, for fear it would sweep me away, too.\n\nI had never expected this. Piece by piece I was drawn with you - drawn by you, rather - into a web of lies, deceit, layer upon layer of hidden truths, and I accepted it because I wanted so desperately to believe in what you said. The Special Section of the Directorate, the Mission - you said Bukharina needed people to defend her, that the Left needed nightwatchmen, to protect it from the monsters in the night. Even as I began to see more than just money in the invoices I signed in my name for you, I believed in what you said.\n\nI see now that the only menace Bukharina needed protection from was your merry band. How could I possibly have ignored the invoices to Suslov? And as you smiled at me and promised that your alliance was nothing but a red herring, were you really thinking of me? Of us?\n\nKnow this, Anton Aronovich Pachikov. I stared into your eyes, so deep and rich like endless golden fields, as the red banners fluttered around us, and you promised never to leave me. I wish I had never swept into your arms. I wish I had never known you at all. And I cannot, no matter how painful it is to remember you, cast you aside. I will ask you one last time.\n\nAre you truly a Suslovite mole? Did what we shared mean nothing to you? Please, tell me. I will never see you again.

Why had Bukharina chosen such an innocuous young woman, with little experience and even less credentials within the Party, to lead the work? The Chairwoman was seldom accused of political interference, but there were outright rumours of corruption swirling around the woman from the start; the choice was so unexpected, it was hard to believe it had not been planned.\n\nWhen the Commission's first meeting kicked off, however, all doubts were dispelled. The woman, introduced only as Comrade Ekaterina, outlined an agenda so ambitious and detailed it could only have come from a consummate political operative. In days she pushed through a proposal outlining radical changes to women-specific wage rate laws and housing specifications, and within weeks it was on the floor of the Congress of the Soviets.\n\nEkaterina brought the Commission to vibrant action in other ways, too: it was quickly discovered that her connections to industry players had bought them all a window into the closed spaces of the business world. A dinner meeting became a formal invitation, and then spiraled into a full-blown conference complete with research initiatives. It was a dream come true for the Committee's members: it seemed that the sky was the limit with this mysterious young woman.\n\nAlthough most never thought to question the Committee Head, one member was not so naive. As Ekaterina was packing her things in the meeting room one evening, the Party Operative approached her and whispered that she knew who Ekaterina was - or at least who she had worked with. Industry access. Windows to all the spheres of government. Secret projects that appeared and disappeared at will. Only one ghost remained this influential in the Republic.\n\nEkaterina chuckled, and whispered to her: "Suslov is dead. I, however, am very much alive." Then she was gone, leaving only a scattering of notes in her wake."

Bukharina chuckled a little to herself - here she was, the most powerful person in the Republic, being taken for a drive.\n\nWell, she couldn't complain too much. It was the Workers' Liberation Day, after all.\n\nThere were fireworks illuminating the town banners as the station-wagon plodded its way into the Central District of Sykvytkar. Bukharina could only wince: poor old Karby would have his feathers scared stiff, if he didn't outright die of shock.\n\nMedvedev simply sighed. "A man of my age, dragged around in a glorified trolley. What would my wife say about all this?" As Bukharina chuckled, he went on. "You know, Svetlana, I never thought we'd get this far. Those early days in the Assembly, when we were just note-passers talking over teatime and gossiping - who'd ever have thought it?"\n\nThe iron in her voice must have surprised him, which was slightly disappointing in itself. "I've always thought it, Roy. Never stopped believing in it. It was inevitable - all we had to do was work for it, no matter the cost. No matter the price." She looked out at the swarms of workers heading to the celebration. "You've always been loyal, for which I thank you. But loyalty isn't enough if you want to build the future."\n\nThe station-wagon pulled up to the packed stadium, and the tunes of The Sacred War blared through the windows.

"Enjoying the food? I suppose we could have chosen a better establishment."\n\nYuri shrugged. "Truth be told, Madame Bukharina, it's all the same to me. I don't care much for affairs of the palate these days." The conversation trailed off, stillborn, and for a long while the two ate in silence.\n\nBukharina pushed her plate away. "I've noticed the Directorate's latest reports on loyalty in rank-and-file unions. Very well written, I'd have struggled to do better myself." Yuri tilted his head a little in acknowledgement, but said nothing.\n\nThe Chairwoman raised her cup to her lips, so what she said next could be heard clear in the echo. "Are there similar concerns with the leadership of the Directorate?" The glint on the cup was unnaturally bright. Yuri put the flash of light before him and the open window about two meters away together and chuckled to himself. The kid was growing fangs.\n\n"I do not believe so, Chairwoman." Of course, now the game was up the pistol in her handbag seemed almost gauche. But it was a good effort from an amateur. Perhaps she would have made as good an operative as she was a politician.\n\n"My apologies, Chairwoman. I must leave for business. Enjoy your meal."

"This machine has been sent to your town by direct order of the Agrarian Advancement Council - approved by the Chairwoman herself." He spoke the last clause with near-reverence. Grigori's already low assessment of the man plummeted still further. He hated blind worshippers of things - God, the Republic, this Chairwoman character (had he even voted for her?), and most of all the metal machines that now raked his neighbours' fields.\n\nGod, how he hated them! Not that he believed in God, but the intensity seemed only fitting. The Bocharovs and their gas-guzzling abomination - he'd been grilling something in his yard when the stench hit, and the cutlet had never recovered. He'd never give in to their monstrosities!\n\nThe Unionist, hearing all this, shrugged sagaciously. "My orders are simply to pass this to you, Mister Grigori. What you choose to do with it is your own business." With that he walked away, and Grigori sighed as he began the mental calculus of fitting this within an already crowded homestead.\n\nThe next morning, he rose to find a flat canvas in his backyard and a distant whirring.

In response to her mild frown, Dmitry only shrugs. A father can only do so much.\n\n"I'm not taking history this semester. We're doing machine-work."\n\nThe parents' eyebrows rise in unison.

He wanted to run, right then and there, but the door was the only entrance to his modest home, and it was locked down tightly. Were they here for him? Had they learned about the alcohol relabelling? He swallowed, nervously, and looked to his left, where the two children, Ivan and Katya, were washing the pots. He thought about calling out to them, but couldn't. If this new Directorate were anything like the Okhrana that had been active here since mere years ago... with nerveless fingers, he pulled the latch. The door swung open, and he retreated as far as he could against the wall.\n\nThe first officer crossed the threshold, carrying something concealed in his long coat. Katya jumped and hid behind her brother. His head swiveled towards Vasily, and he gestured, bringing three more people inside. Vasily's eyes widened in shock.\n\nChairwoman Svetlana Bukharina stepped into his humble home, with a hand on her black brimmed hat. In one hand, she held a book. In the other, a pen. Ivan looked down, cried out and dropped the pan that he was carrying at sight of the the pistol on her belt.

At a glance, he noticed that the pistols were gone, replaced by books and writing utensils.\n\nHe took the book from the officer, gingerly, before trying to flatten himself against the wall even more. It was useless to him, but perhaps obeying could get him out unharassed, without the unexpected quartet looking under the floorboards. Bukharina placed her book on the table, smiling to the children, before speaking.\n\n"I apologize for the unexpected visit, comrades," she begun, before presenting a piece of paper with some illegible text on it. "This village has been marked as the next stop for the liquidation of rural illiteracy. Has the local council informed you of your local liquidation point?"\n\nThe children tentatively inched towards the door. Vasily blinked once, uncomprehending. Did that mean- this was all an overly-threatening entrance for what he understood as a political reading group? The seeds of a chuckle escaped his mouth, to be strangled in a moment by anxiety. Sensing that compliance was the way out, he let himself begin to form words.\n\n"I- No. No, Comrade Chairwoman.", he said.\n\nBukharina nodded, slightly.\n\n"Your locality has assembled a center in the back room of the town hall.

At moments of stress, doubt or fear she withdrew to her home and the comfort of Karby, where the voices and the endless expectant gazes could be dispelled for at least a few hours.\n\nNow she gazed upon the preening bird, her eyes unfocused and dull, her mind elsewhere altogether. She was, in her mind's eye, leaving through the brief history of her interactions with Suslov. An impromptu alliance here, a common resolution there. In truth, the two had never shared much in common despite their common cause, and the days when they had fought under the same banner seemed increasingly distant. A mirage through a telescope of time.\n\nWith some effort she wrested her attention to the present, and the letter awaiting her. She had no real desire to open it, because she knew how it read. The inevitable had come to pass. On the envelope was marked the words, SUSLOV - CONTINGENCY PLAN: VERMILLION RAT. In it were details of the operation that would remove her greatest remaining political opponent in the Republic. She'd been in the briefing herself: this last letter was merely a formality. All it would take was a stamp and a signature, and the paralysis of the Left in the Republic would come to an end.\n\nSo why did her hands tremble so as she thought? No, she felt no real remorse: she knew what had to be done. It felt...wrong, like cutting the last strings to one's anchor. And, in truth, Suslov was nothing without his supporters.

The funny thing was that it really wasn't that different from the work he'd done in his cavorting with Suslov: one glanced through dossiers, picking apart the details of someone's life and family and career, and at the end one made a choice. If the choice was positive, Andropov would add it to the large pile on the left: if not, to the small, neat and alphabetically arranged stack on the left. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAndropov had once made the mistake of talking to a priest about his line of work; the latter had mumbled something about the sheep and the goats, and then he'd retreated. Well, even without having read the Good Book Andropov knew what he was on about. His job was essentially that of a judge: the good and the bad, the assets and the liabilities. The quick and the dead.\n\nAnd there had been so very many of the latter in recent days, Yuri mused. For some reason Headquarters was sending over requests at a vastly increased rate, even compared to the early days of the Revolution. They were lucky that the Directorate had recently gotten a wave of new recruits. This stack had been the result of what he estimated to be three months' worth of labor. Otherwise...well, no Revolutionary state had survived the collapse of its security apparatus.\n\nA staffer poked his head out the side of the door, yelling: "Director Andropov!

She read through pages filled with pictures of Inca statues, African masks, Korean totems and more, finding herself immersed in the history of art. Idly, she looked towards the cabinet in the study, wondering if there was any hidden history in the trophies and valuables inside. Lost in her idle reverie, she barely registered the sound of the door opening.\n\n"Chairwoman?" Her secretary called, leaning out from outside. He was holding the white handset, covering the microphone. She turned her head, looking at the door. The book dropped, a shallow thud emanating from below.\n\n"Yes?"\n\n"Comrade Malinina wishes to speak to you." The Chairwoman opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off. "I understand that it is your off day today, but she says that it will be quick."\n\nSvetlana nodded, putting her book on the table. Straightening her outfit, she took the receiver. "Yulia?"\n\n"This may seem a bit sudden, but with all of your work on women's liberation, have you ever given any thought to legalizing homosexuality?"\n\nSvetlana blinked. She had always just ignored the concerns of the homosexuals - but maybe it was for the best if she finally took up the cause.\n\n"Sveta, are you there?"\n\n"Yes. I'm still here."

From afar, he made insights into people's lives - most would call it slander. Perhaps it was insensitive, but Alexei didn't see any harm in the matter. He blew into the whistle, and fifty people began to cross the street. The man in the fedora over there probably likes to play the harp. The woman in the red blazer likes her tea with milk for some strange reason. The two teen boys over there holding hands -\n\nWait a damn minute. They were holding hands. People could do that now? People lik- 'Focus on the job, Alexei. You're late to let the cars pass.' He told himself, blowing the whistle once more, gesturing to the drivers that they could go. Alexei continued working late into the afternoon, the thought of him holding hands with another comrade, until Antonina arrived to begin her shift. He made his way home, silently contemplating. He walked by a poster proclaiming 'COMRADES CAN LOVE WHO THEY LOVE' in bright red letters.\n\nTurning his head back, he thought that maybe he could. It had been a long time since he had first fallen for another man. He looked back fondly on that time - he was young and full of idiocy back then, talking about how he "loved danger."

Suffice to say that when our medical teams entered we found more to scrape off than to lift up - he had been fed through a grinder, apparently, and what was left was quite frankly immaterial in the literal sense.\n\nWhat I want you to know, Dinara, is this: it was not us. No matter what the radio says in the coming days or weeks, I know the Muslim community here. We have always had faith in God to preserve us - you know that we are not violent people. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nWhat we believe may soon be irrelevant, however. Already the Government has issued another of their foul Revolutionary Directives to begin 'investigations' into the death, and the neighbours of the flat I am staying in have been questioned several times in the last week. And there is more, too: they are actively removing those that still wear the veils. Yes, women are being accosted on the street for the crime of following what they believe. Is this the socialist culture we were told would set us free?\n\nIt is not safe for us here, not anymore, and I know that you are a loyal servant. You, too, will not long survive the Government's anger. Pack your suitcase, my love: we must flee from the cities until this latest transgression is forgotten. I will meet you, and if I do not, know that you have always been with me, in my heart. Do not fear - this, too, will pass.\n\nYours with love, Akhmad."

A calm, a reorganizing of efforts before pushing to the Pacific?\n\nShe chuckled, shaking her head. This was supposed to be a time where she didn't think about politics. She brushed those thoughts aside and continued onwards, allowing the cool breeze to blow on her. She took off her hat, feeling the wind flow through her hair. It felt nice, as she never was able to spend much time outside. It was almost as if the winds of change were blowing in her favor.\n\nShe had so much more left to do. The people of West Siberia had suffered greatly, and would have to be assisted by her government. There were so many social reforms she'd have to implement, as well. She nee- no.

After all, as a modern socialist country, we cannot allow over half of our population to be deprived of the rights they deserve.

While their parents would play a role in their upbringing, said upbringing would be collective, involving the entire community. This would prevent the parents from passing on bad traditions to their children, while also ensuring that the children get a well-rounded childhood. This would also mean that the family, as it exists now, would be phased out if this was the nationwide standard. Does that make sense to you?"\n\nDimitri mused it over. He understood the concept, and could see how it would be executed. "Yes, it makes sense to me. However, I can imagine that there would be those opposed to such an idea, along with the possible negative consequences.

He'd be sure to remain loyal to socialism, of course. Ivan had no plans to get into trouble now of all times, especially when change seemed on the horizons. He grabbed a piece of paper and a pen.

Her mind wandered, for once freed of political concerns. However, her thoughts, after a time, would inevitably drift back to politics.\n\nBukharina was content. Her reforms had borne fruit, and it seemed the [NIK.GetName] was stronger than ever. Man and woman stood as equals, and those of a different race were not oppressed anymore. Unlike so many other socialists, she had worked to ensure that these rights weren't in name only. Bukharina could only hope it was a good start for fighting for equality.\n\nNow, with West Siberia stabilized and the foundations of a new Soviet Union forged, the time was approaching to unite all of Russia under one banner. Finally, the chaos that had plagued Russia for decades would be ended. However, that could wait for one more day.

Radios are switched on, through the Republic's environs, and their volume turned all the way up as horrified ears take it all in.\n\nIt would probably have been easier to accept if the new regime offered concessions or promised a transition to a more permanent and just public order. Zhdanov, of course, promises with his trademark cheer that soon the citizens will return to a normality that favours the Republic as a whole.\n\nThe initial protests are unsettlingly loud and unnervingly close. Stations are barricaded or simply refuse to open, as do shophouses and public institutions. Police officers stationed in the district find themselves overwhelmed by the popular pressure, and a number of undercover police are nearly discovered and lynched by sheer force of popular anger. As it turns out, the broken clock of public anger does, in fact, strike twice a day.\n\nThis unnerves the covert agents of Special Circumstances. New plans are created in the dead of night, and networks once thought solid melt and coalesce in new configurations, like a shifting cloud forming around a dense maze. At the heart of this cloud are a group of seemingly random individuals. They will be the first test of the new Republic's socialist science.\n\nOn a Monday morning, as the not-protests roll into their fifth day, individuals begin to disappear from the protests, and when they return they speak as if they had never doubted the Republic - when they speak at all. The confusion they spread instead poisons the protests, rumors of internal disorder and violence stain its reputation, and by Wednesday order has returned, albeit in a less-than-satisfactory form."

 zhdanov.13.d:0 "The meeting had been early in the morning, with many of the men drinking coffee. Some of them preferred to be drinking a more heavy substance, one that would wake them up and prepare them for a day of discussing the next generations of warfare that they would develop and the armies would take place in. Many subjects had been brought up so far, such as the development of bombers that could strike from miles in the air and hit targets countries away.\n\nHowever, one of the more polarizing topics that had been brought up was the development of lasers. Lasers had been a personal interest of many of the scientists who had been assigned to work on the projects. However, they soon remembered that they had to focus on only the next generation and not fifty years now. Many of them shared the same ideas. The warfare in the coming decade would mostly be shaped as similar to the combat that many of them had seen so far. One that was fought and won with fast moving vehicles and a very mobile infantry. Some scientists had more outlying ideas that soon garnered more interest. One idea was proposed that the next generation of war would be completely fought with air combat. Land would be seen as irrelevant unless the helicopters or planes had been dropping off soldiers for a fast-strike mission, such as a raid. While the idea had certainly been seen as laughable at first, it soon garnered more attention as some of the men had begun to agree with it after thinking over the idea a few times. While certainly controversial, it was an opinion that could possibly work in due time. As the men filed out the building to continue their research, they wondered if it was truly possible at the end of the day."

 zhdanov.14.d:0 "Like the meeting the scientists had recently, it was another one focused on warfare of a certain generation. However, instead of focusing on the next decade that many of them would possibly be alive for, they now focused on 2070. The year was picked due to it being a whole century later, one that would be very focused on really seeing on how much the scientists could think of. As the scientists fired into the room, they saw the assignment that they needed to do, so they began to get to work.\n\nUnlike the previous discussion, many of the men did not go into camps to discuss their ideas. The whole exercise was one that was seen as a radical decision. It was one hundred years later, certainly something that none of the men would be alive for. Maybe some of their great grandchildren, but not them. Many of them had differing ideas, but many stuck to one or two ideas by the end of the day. The first idea being that the warfare in 2070 would be largely focused around the internal mind of soldiers, with them fighting in an environment that would be largely based upon the basis of "neuro-warfare" a concept that would be developed in the next century as a way to both train soldiers and as a tool for battle. The second idea was one that the wars of tomorrow would be fought with huge towering machines. Ones that would carry armaments that would destroy the armies of today within hours. While they would be extremely expensive, even a country having one would be a massive detriment from any attacks on them. Like the last meeting, when the time was up, the men filed out. However unlike the last one, many had felt much more inspired by this one, thinking that if it was truly possible to have our minds do the battle for us or even giant machines to fight."

In the coming days he had to decide a manufacturer that would produce all of the weapons that the Soviet Federation would use to take back Moscow. However he still needed to pick.\n\nOne of the options was a group that had been relatively unknown, known as Goran Arms. The company itself had been around for about ten years, and had produced weapons of good quality. They had been known for being on time, but with weapons that had been seen as basic to the times. On the other hand was the G.A. Korobov, a famous visionary that had made his name known with his weapon designs. While he had yet to put out a design, he had found favor with the many visionaries that found themselves home in the federation.\n\nAs Zhdanov read over the two profiles, it came soon apparent that he would need to choose. While he quite liked the companies both, he liked the visionary nature of Korobov. However he liked that Goran had produced weapons before that had been well received."

Some had taken unbelievably daring journeys over German lines to get there. Emma's story was significantly less impressive; she flew in from New York after some time as a student radical. She shared an apartment in the capital with a few other foreigners, and when the "Embassy of the Global Proletariat" was announced she was among the first to sign up.\n\nThe building was an old meeting hall, chosen for its scale, with different nations' delegations arranged in a great circle, and Emma decided to tour them before joining her comrades in the American section. First came the Soviet section, robustly populated with a number of local officials. Then came the British section, an eclectic collection of elderly resistance fighters and trade unionists. The German delegation piqued her interest. "Comrades, you must have suffered greatly under fascism. How did you escape?"\n\nThe man she was addressing looked confused before replying in what was unmistakably a local accent, "Ah, I see the confusion. In the absence of German representatives, we are portraying the German proletariat in their stead."\n\nStrolling the aisles from Hungary's, to Iran's, to, most bizarrely of all, the "oppressed African peoples'" delegations, Emma found that the case was the same. Without the global proletariat actually present, the Soviets had taken to casting Russians in their roles and instructing them to imagine what the people of those nations might support. While she appreciated the enthusiasm, perhaps it may have been better to leave this particular project on the drawing board."

For this reason, this letter is being written in [NIK.Capital.GetName] instead of Moscow, so long the heart of Russia - for this reason, millions suffer in the groans of an oppression so horrific it is almost unbelievable.\n\nFor this reason, while millions burned in East Europe, you defiled the surface of the Moon - an innocent celestial body which had done you no harm - with a flag steeped in the remains of those who have wanted nothing more than to resist you.\n\nWe understand, too, that your Masters wish to bend history, and have deluded themselves into believing they can control the future of the world by simply willing it into being with rifles and tanks. To this we have nothing to say, except the obligatory words of the sane to the madman: good luck! May you soon be disabused of this idea, and may its loss hurt you bitterly.\n\nBut we will make no bones about our own desires: what was stolen from the Workers of Russia, the Russian People cry out day and night to regain. The boots you use to stamp upon our people from old Kiev to old Leningrad will be consumed in fire as you are held aloft, the yoke turned inside out and twisted into a stabbing dagger. We will stop at nothing until our people are free.\n\nAnd on behalf of that part of the world that still calls itself free, we cordially invite you to take down the offending flags - and the armies that held them aloft - and leave at once, for Germania your home.

Not for the stunning architecture or natural beauty, mind you, although we do possess plenty of those once you get past the suburbs. (Laughter.)\n\nNo, comrades, what I am speaking about is the beauty of Proletarian Unity. Now, I am sure many of us would laugh at that last statement, and who can blame you? The history of socialism, in Russia as everywhere else, is steeped in the tears of betrayal and mutual recrimination. Were one to ask a worker in the streets of your average urban city anywhere around the world, he would call the Communist one who was more dedicated to fighting his contemporaries than his enemies! (Laughter, commotion.)\n\nThat disunity cost us dearly when our enemies came for us, as we had foretold so clearly. Indeed, we are the Cassandras of history: always warning of the catastrophes awaiting the Capitalist world and on guard against Fascism, and yet never able to protect ourselves from our predictions. Our squabbling kept us from mounting an effective resistance, here in Russia, and around the world the smoke of failed revolutions wafted countries even further into chaos than they had been at the start.\n\nNo more, comrades! We face the most fearsome and final enemy, right at the doors of Russia and around the world, and yet we have nowhere left to retreat!

As the Federation had grown in complexity and size, so too had his administrative functions, until it seemed like half his job was scheduling meetings for the right people to meet each other and get things done for him.\n\nThe other half, however...Zhdanov smiled. The other half of his job made it all worth it.\n\nThe old dream he'd hidden was coming into view, in gluts of weekly reports from the scientists. The limits of the human mind were being stretched into new shapes and patterns; even where his ideas had failed, they had given so much information in the bargain that he couldn't say they'd been failures at all. Soon the New Socialist Man would rise like Titans from the deep, super-men ready to rebuild the shattered nation and bring Proletarian humanity to where they'd always dreamt of going: the stars.\n\nAnd the machines on which they would ride were coming into being, too - as the Testing Initiatives grew ever more expansive, their tests blossomed into fruition, too. Forget about the military applications, he'd always told the Generals. The wonder is enough. And the wonder Zhdanov experienced as he read about the test flights he couldn't watch personally was like - a man watching the summer stars, dreaming of taking flight. Yes, like a scene in a dream.\n\nNodding quietly, Zhdanov rummaged around his study and began a new series of scribblings in a well-worn leather notebook. Frowning, he scrapped the first draft he'd drawn and began a new one. This one was far more complex than the first; notes to self-referential articles abounded, and with them actual scientific reports, but in the centre were three clear and outlined words, circled repeatedly as with a child's drawing."

We know that our course is true; our people are our benchmark and the Science of Marxism our guide. "\n\n"But a man looking towards the Stars will never be content with the things of Earth alone.

The realisation that Ultravisionary Socialism is destined to spread throughout the universe, as determined by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov's intense study of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Originally promulgated as a solution to the Fermi Paradox of Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, which observes the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence of extraterrestrial life and the immense likelihood of its existence, Paramount Leader Zhdanov discovered that the most likely block to the advancement of extraterrestrial life to the interplanetary and intersolar stages of development was the persistence of backward stages of development (feudalism, capitalism, fascism) on alien worlds.\n\nWith the immortal science of Ultravisonary Socialism only existing on Earth, brought to us by the unique genius of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, only Earth holds the possibility of rising to a higher stage of interplanetary, intersolar, and perhaps even intergalactic development. It is thus the duty of the Soviet Federation, as one true embodiment of Ultravisionary Socialism, to spread itself first across the Earth, and then to alien worlds suffering under the oppression of primitive barbarism.\n\nTHE INTERSOLAR SOVIET FEDERATION. A future space-faring intersolar civilization founded on the principles of Ultravisionary Socialism, as vaticinated by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov. Starting on Earth, the Intersolar Soviet Federation will spread from planet to planet, liberating alien species from the oppression of feudalism, capitalism, and fascism. Its armed forces, the Intersolar Red Armada, will obliterate all enemies in its path, assisting extraterrestrial workers and peasants in their struggle against their oppressors. It will educate the alien workers in the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, and ingrain in them a deep understanding of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Ultimately, the Intersolar Soviet Federation is destined to expand throughout the universe, ushering in a final, Universal Soviet Federation, and an eternal aeon of universal peace, prosperity, and liberty."

Listening in on people for the Commissariat gave him a sense of connection to people he felt he would otherwise never have, even if they were total strangers.\n\nSome he even grew attached to. One old man, a retired violinist, routinely played his instrument in his small apartment on the third floor of the complex. He was of little interest in terms of scientific observation, yet Volkov still listened in almost every day, and came to love and depend on the old man's little personal recitals. When the old man finally died, Volkov felt the loss deeply. He even broke protocol and attended the old man's funeral from a distance, leaving flowers at his grave after his family and friends had departed.\n\nAnother subject Volkov grew close to was a florist who lived in one of the second floor apartments. He grew to love the sound of her voice, on the phone to her mother, or drinking with a friend, or just talking to her flowers, which she treated with great care and fondness. Volkov wrote down her every idle move, the notes then fed back to the scientists for analysis. Yet one day, while hosting a party at her house, Volkov caught her disparaging Paramount Leader Zhdanov, calling him a "unhinged lunatic." Volkov felt great mental anguish over this incident.\n\nOf course, he ultimately turned her in. While their directive was merely to observe and document cultural and social shifts in the population, they were also duty-bound to report anti-ultravisionary behaviour and speech. She would do a short stint at a reeducation camp, and be back in no time. Yet when she returned, she was much changed. She no longer talked to her plants, or to anybody for that matter, not her mother or her friends. Volkov grew worried, and then bored.

A meeting, perhaps?\n\nLeaning in, he heard the muffled words: "...will compensate you for the human losses, Kryushkov."\n\n"You must be mad. Two weeks from the last 'retrieval' and you must take another child? What on earth are you doing to them?" The Master's voice had something...different to it. It sounded reedy, almost pained. Was he in mourning?\n\n"We are building the Revolution. Young children, too, must serve this goal. Now, please, step aside - I do not want to make this messy. Oh, and they are all illiterate, are they not? " Silence. "Very well. We will teach them with the words of Marx." The door swung open, catching Pyotr in the floodlights of the yard. A thick-waisted man with a false smile leaned down towards him, his eyes gleaming like the magpies they often saw in the yard.\n\n"Hello, little boy. How would you like to serve the Socialist Paradise?" Pyotr, tongue-tied, only stared. In an instant the man's gaze turned to coldness and he nodded to the darkness outside. "Take this one. We will train him to agree, too."\n\nAs black-gloved hands dragged him away from the Factory, Pyotr heard beyond the sounds of his own cries the faint sobbing of the Master, echoing in the expanse of the lobby like a bird's call."

Of note are:\n\nSubject 3: Administered XXXX gas through ventilation in the evening, observed the following day.\nDaily triggers included: Loud tapping across the walls; noise replicated from war-era Stuka dive bombers for fifteen (15) minutes every six (6) hour period; a list of phrases read aloud (see list on page 58); a recital of the Communist Manifesto with alternating narrators.\nResult: Subject did not exhibit any abnormalities in mental or physical functioning for three (3) days. On the fourth (4) day, subject collapsed during lunch in their cell and experienced a heart attack. This test was replicated on 2 more subjects to no results. Original subject expired on XX/XX/XX.\n\nSubject 8: Experiment began with the subject being placed into lab chair XXXX (X), observed by four (4) scientists.

Brotherhoods of humanity, wielding their collective knowledge to construct a future unimaginable to the average man of today.

They were supplied with food, entertainment material, and never interfered with aside from the Subliminal Messaging. For a three (3) month period, the subjects were allowed to do as they pleased. Most went about their ordinary lives, occupying themselves with readings and social interactions. The experiment itself began on week two (2): whenever a subject found themselves isolated, we would play low-level white noise in their room, coupled with occasional subliminal phrases meant to influence the subject into taking certain actions. The entirety of the compound was equipped with speaker systems.\nBy week six (6), all subjects had experienced the phrases and elected to stick together. By your authorization on XX/XX/XX, we began playing the white noise and subliminal messages even when the subjects were in groups. By the final month, the program would play nearly every day, up to four hours a day.\nResult: At first, the subjects refused to comply with the messages, so we toned down the requests. By week eight (8) we were no longer requesting actions, but rather filtering in phrases from the propagandist's office. After the experiment's conclusion, the subjects were questioned. No changes in behaviour or belief were noted, nor had their anti-revolutionary stance changed.

Since you have certainly passed the accuracy tests, I believe it is about time to transition to the simulation tests, don't you agree?' said the engineer standing behind the soldier. He looked especially smug about receiving praise from Turgenev, who had harshly criticized many of his previous designs.\n\n'Yeah, sure. Hopefully it doesn't snap when I get off the helicopter.

It has performed as expected in airborne drop scenarios, and has been proven to be functional as an infantry weapon. Comrade Afanasyev has managed to reduce the inaccuracy caused by the rifle's unique characteristics down to a margin of 5%. Soldiers testing the weapon report its unusually light weight as a major boon, and some officers have already requested the Tarakan prototype rifle, official name pending, for use in airborne operations.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nProject Tarakan has proven to be a success, and Comrade Afanasyev's design meets all requirements necessary for production authorization.

Your. Shitty. Rifle,' with that said, Turgenev walked away from the firing range, the engineer too afraid to continue the argument.\n\nPROJECT TARAKAN - TEST 41 RESULTS:\nComrade Asfanasyev's 'bullpup' design has faced numerous problems during its development. The chief issue being its long-range accuracy. The extremely short barrel and extremely light weight have a tendency to drastically reduce the accuracy of those using the rifle. Test 41 concluded when the soldier testing the rifle, Sargeant Sergei Turgenev, grew frustrated with the rifle's inaccuracy and exited the firing range. Sergeant Sergei Turgenev received a brief reprimand for his poor behavior, but is expected to return to normal duty within the week.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe Tarakan prototype rifle has failed to meet any accuracy standards required for production, and development of the rifle is growing too expensive to justify the rifle's somewhat niche purpose. As such, it is recommended that Comrade Asfanasyev's project be defunded, and for him to be returned to his position within the Soviet Instrument Design Bureau."

Similarly, the laser wiped out a radar system without harming the dog sitting next to it, and the Szhatie prototype effectively tracked and disable three aircraft, forcing their pilots to bail. It was surprisingly silent too, a small buzzing sound that was easily drowned out by the sound of the generator's roar. The prototype had surpassed all expectations he had had for it, and the scientist next to him kept rambling on and on about the many scientific miracles that went into building it. Clearly he was proud of his work.\n\n'So, Comrade Aslanov, how much would it cost to make more of these miraculous weapons? They've clearly proven their effectiveness,' The general expected some long-winded response from the overly talkative scientist, but instead he went deathly pale and went silent. That couldn't be a good sign.\n\nPROJECT SZHATIE RESULTS: Partial Success\n\nCONCLUSION: While the Project Szhatie prototype exceeded all expectations, and passed all tests with flying colors. The officer overseeing the tests initially advocated for further production, until learning of the costs. The artificial rubies used to focus the laser are prohibitively expensive, and drastically raise the cost of production. This alone makes Project Szhatie unfeasible for mass-production, however the design is also limited by its massive power requirements, which likewise raise the design's cost.

The variable sweep wings have proven to be highly effective in their role, allowing the bomber to use a much shorter runway for takeoff and avoid the danger of stalls at high speeds. The bomber is planned to be capable of carrying both heavy cruise missiles for standard targets and lighter rocket pods for softer targets.\n\nPerformance-wise, the bomber has met all parameters expected, surpassing Mach 3 and having a service ceiling of 12,000 meters, high enough to evade German interceptors and anti-aircraft weapons. Avionics data suggests that the expected loadout will be well within its capabilities. The cost of developing such an aircraft has been extensive, as more than six hundred patents have been filed based on this project alone, but as production scales we will find more efficient methods of producing the necessary parts.

The vehicle suffers from many of the same issues as the German tanks captured during the last war, particularly the Tiger and Maus. CHEREPAKHA solves a number of problems those vehicles suffered from, particularly the unreliability of the drive train and excessive fuel consumption, and overall is able to maintain a higher level of performance for longer.\n\nHowever, a number of other problems have emerged as a result of our solutions to the original problems. The lead lining of the crew compartment, the four-track drive train, and the unusual disc shape have resulted in the need for us to establish a completely new production line at the Izhevsk plant to create the prototype. Maintenance has also been an issue, as access to the mechanical portions of the tank is limited due to the design of the tank, and makes field repairs effectively impossible.\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, the vehicle has performed quite well in trials run by our personnel and demonstrations run for our military procurement officials, proving highly resistant to artillery fire and to rarely break down. It is not suitable for mass deployment, as it lacks mobility to contend with modern battle tanks, but it possesses the armor and firepower that allows it to take on anything lighter, and will certainly fill an important niche in our military."

The rifle can also be fired ambidextrously since the cartridges are ejected behind the magazine. The rifle's rate of fire meets projected expectations, approximately 3 times faster than our currently equipped Kalashnikov rifles, and is chambered in the same 7.62x39 caliber.\n\nThe primary issues encountered in testing resulted from increased recoil, due to the greater amount of propellant used in each pull of the trigger. The rifle is also heavier than our current standard-issue rifles, and presents a considerable logistical challenge by expending three times as much ammunition as a standard Kalashnikov.\n\nHowever, if these logistical issues can be overcome, the rifle will serve as an excellent front-line infantry weapon.

After some failed experiments with caseless ammunition they have settled on the 7.62x39mm round used in Kalashnikov's automatic rifles, which should allow us to integrate it into our supply chain with relative ease.\n\nIncreased recoil has led us to recommend the addition of a bipod and an increase in the size of the weapon to allow the inclusion of a more robust feed system. Once this is completed, we will be able to put this weapon into production as a functional heavy support rifle. The increased rate of fire allows it to properly fulfill its role without consuming too much ammunition, and the jamming rate will be significantly reduced by the time we begin the manufacturing process.\n\nThe weight of the weapon makes it prohibitively heavy to issue as a standard infantry rifle, but it is lighter than most of our machine guns, and the use of a magazine instead of a belt makes it simple for any soldier trained in operating a Kalashnikov to use.

The first order of business is the discussion of our government's future prospects. While we have achieved much in the past months, our work is far from over. We have achieved victory over the splitters and fascists and reasserted ourselves as the preeminent power west of the Urals.

What does this mean?"\n\n"It says it right here- 'The [NIK.GetName] is pleased to announce that since the order of Comrade Suslov to investigate and rectify the unsuitable status of women within the nation, we have found that in all aspects of life, we have achieved complete equality between the sexes. Unlike the bourgeoisie capitalists and oppressive fascists who value women only as homemakers and broodmares, socialist society has advanced to a point where women serve in equal positions to men. Our investigations found this to hold true from the factories of Gorki to the fields of Bashkortostan.' Isn't this what you've been advocating since the days of Vosnesensky?"\n\n"So thanks to this proclamation my neighbor has stopped beating his wife when dinner is not to his satisfaction? And that when women are sent into a factory that they are treated properly by the men who tell them what to do? What do you think this actually does?"\n\n"It allows us to focus on restoring the Union, Katya! The party has allowed women to work in the place of men to strengthen us, and you're giving me this hysterical anti-state lecture-"\n\n"You're hopeless, Vanya."

Providing greater representation, autonomy, and identity for the Tatars loyal to the regime, we are urged to believe that this sovereign autonomy can help us better govern the various regions now under our administration.\n\nThe proposal was presented to the politburo, receiving various different reactions from members.

They are already hard at work, diligently surveying production efficiency of factories across our territories, as well as gathering statistics on raw output of various resources and materiel.\n\nTheir co-workers look on at them with a vile suspicion, skeptical of their origin and presence in the factories. Whilst they hammer away at metals, or bolt together engines and arms, the new surveyors watch over them with an objectifying gaze. An anonymity had arisen in many workplaces, one worthy of causing dispute if not reconciled soon enough."

As they settled in and whispered into the microphones, the host greeted them and asked about their journey northwards, to which they responded with horrific stories of the freezing cold and the escape from bandits and murderers.\n\nEventually, the host came to the topic of the socialist cause in Russia, and what it meant to the guest. He remained silent for a moment, thinking about the question, before answering with bold and proud statements of admiration, confessing that even after living under brutal fascist indoctrination, we remained true to the teachings of Marx and Lenin. Furthermore, he detailed that many in Samara believed similar things, but were not so fortunate to escape from the grips of the fascist bandit regime.\n\nAs the interview concluded, the radio host thanked his guest and asked if he had any final words for the people living in western Russia. He cleared his throat and replied in his timid voice, urging the people to remain vigilant to the red torch of socialism, even when living in the most vile and brutal conditions, as the liberating march of the Red Army will rescue them soon as they rescued him. Emphasizing this message, the host thanked the guest again before finishing his interview and returning to the normal broadcast schedule expected by his audience."

Suslov did not look up from his writing.\n\n"No, General Secretary."\n\nThe response took seconds, but the unnaturally long pause felt far longer. "Comrade Genera-"\n\n"Your writings have caused me grave concern, Comrade Ignatyev. I am concerned that the ideas you espouse in them are undesirable and contrary to the principles of the revolution. I expect this to be remedied immediately. You are a delegate of the Supreme Soviet and you will behave as one. Malcontents will not be tolerated by the party, the new Soviet Union, or myself.

The waitress set down eight cups of tea on the table, plucking one off her tray after the other.\n\nThe comrade in the suit reached first, then the suited comrade, then the comrade who wore a suit. The clique sipped at their tea. "Quite good." said one.\n\n"Quite." said the other, stirring the drink. Silent was the table.\n\nOne eventually disturbed the stillness, "Quite good indeed, not too unlike the direction of the party." The table nodded in agreement.\n\n"My tea is bitter," Piped up one member of the table, "It tastes old."\n\nThe table responded with a chorus of affirmation. The consensus was clear, the tea was old. "Shall I call the waitress then?"\n\n"No, no. The owner doesn't care for complaints, he'd have us removed." The table murmured in agreement. So they grumbled, but still sipped their tea."

It was no use. He needed a drink before he'd make any progress tonight. Arvids pushed back his chair and made his way for the kitchen. It wasn't a long journey, from one side of his apartment to the other, but it felt liberating just to be away from the desk. The downside was, however, he'd have to walk past him.\n\nThe portrait of Mikhail Suslov watched him as he made his way to his cabinet and retrieved his drink of choice. "Slacking on the job?" The portrait asked. "I should expect nothing less from you, Comrade Pelshe." Arvids shook the thoughts from his head. It was going to be alright, even if the reports were less than stellar, it wasn't damning. It meant there was room for improvement and Comrade Suslov ate up talk of improving, especially if it adheres to orthodox methods. Best of both worlds he'd say.\n\nArvids hobbled back to his desk, the papers strewn across his desk, hanging from the walls, dripping out from the clouds above, he inhaled reports and exhaled them back out.

He knew the economy, he at least could say that much. His job was to analyze the market and mold it to the worker's best interest. What Arvids enjoyed more than putting his knowledge into practice was sharing it with just about anybody who would listen.\n\nSpeaking at the Syktyvkar Academy of State Service and Administration, Comrade Pelshe fell into his stride near immediately, speaking at length about the superiority of the socialist system employed by Comrade Suslov. What the economist didn't account for was for someone to talk back. Such is natural living day to day as and with yes men.\n\n"Comrade Pelshe," asked one of the pupils, "Should we not adhere to the foundation laid down by Comrade Buhkarin? I understand his shortcomings were plenty but at the same time, he led the charge to revitalize Siberia. A project, as we can see from what little news trickles in from the east, has bared fruit"\n\nArvids tightened his grip on the podium, his knuckles turning white, "I will capitulate to you on that point. Comrade Bukharin made great strides in breathing life into the dead east. However, I should not have to remind you where we are and how we ended up not in the Soviet Union of old, but in this new one. It is simply a matter of sustainability. Long term vs short term. The socialist struggle cannot end at Siberia or Russia proper. It must continue on, not remain stagnant!"

His father had died in Sevastopol, his mother in the chaos of the West Russian War, his brother and nephew's to a bout of tuberculosis that had hit their village not three years prior.\n\nHow was sitting at a desk, looking over the same plan's his fellows had already analysed and scrutinized three or four times by now going to avenge any of them? If he was honest with himself, he didn't know. But he was a member of the Communist party precisely for that reason. The higher ups knew what they were talking about, and if they wanted the plans checked thrice to ensure nothing within them threatened the revolution that was exactly what Vladimir would do.\n\nAn icy smile appeared on his face.

Oh he'd risen to the rank of Executive Secretary of his Primary Party Organisation for sure, but that wasn't much of a claim to boast about when said PPO only contained about 20 people, less than a thousandth of the greater membership of the Communist Party in Komi. Yet he did his work well, tried to take satisfaction in it when orders from the parties higher ups came down.\n\nRight now for instance, he'd been delegated to grant a series of awards to high performing members of the peasantry, mostly for services to socialism and the like. Apparently the party leadership was trying to emphasise their contributions to the survival of true communism or something. Talgat didn't really care, he had a job to do.\n\nThe people standing in the uneven line to his side, facing the cameras were an odd bunch. A mix of young women and elderly men for the most part, many stoney faced and scarred by years of hard labour in service of what they believed in. A young boy as well, apparently he'd single handedly stopped a fire which nearly reached a grain silo. As Talgat handed the boy his medal, he gave him a slight pat on the shoulder and assured him that the Party was proud of what he'd done. The sight of the smiling boy with his burn scarred face wouldn't visit Talgat in his dreams that night. But when he awoke he made sure to write a note to the Party higher ups to put him on the fast track for promotion within the party when he came of age anyway."

 suslov.14.d:0 ""Gold. How many blood was spilt for a metal that has barely any use in anything that isn't jewelry or electronics."\n\nArvids Pelshe was sitting in his chair, thinking about the measures that could strengthen the ruble. Main reason why monetary reform even started is to make ruble viable for outside trade, and in order to do this it should be as stable as it possibly can. Oldest method in economics book is to peg the currency to our gold reserves, which are scarce, but it should be enough to stabilize the prices. Next step is to establish a fixed exchange rate, mainly to avoid possible machinations and prevent inflation that it may cause. It was near midnight, but something didn't let Pelshe to fall asleep. Will his efforts to strengthen the ruble worth it? In the end money will lose all it's value, as Soviet industry grows more organized the more people will recognize money as what it is: a paper with ink on it.\n\nNo. In fifty years or so it will become a reality, he was sure about that, but right now there's no means to ensure the safe transition to moneyless society.

 suslov.15.d:0 "The students gathered together in the school library, at the same spot in the back as every other school day. It was their own private little space away from the commotion of the classes to work on their greatest assignment yet; to study the ideas and explore the thoughts of the revolutionary father of Russia, Vladimir Lenin.\n\nFor young Kliment though, it was a slog. A constant, endless slog of reading dozens of long, winding tomes going on and on about the roles of the vanguard party, the establishment of the proletariats' dictatorship, etcetera etcetera. Most exhausting of all though was the man himself. From his birth in Simbirsk to his life in Saint Petersburg to his many imprisonments and his advocation for a continent wide revolution in the First World War... At least the October Revolution was coming up soon in their studies, so he could read up on a bit of action.\n\nThere were two reasons driving Kliment to stay diligent in his studies and not slack off, the first being his friends. They were into communism far more than he was and they were much more invested into this assignment, but they made Kliment laugh, they goofed around with him, they played pranks on each other, but most of all, they made him feel whole. And when school ended and he said his brief goodbyes to them 'til the next day, he'd have only one thing on his mind.\n\nIndeed, the young teen cared little for the old Bolshevik, and yet he was the greatest reason he worked so hard in his studies. His family was one marred by strife; from a father struck down by the Germans in the western war, to cousins and old family friends torn away during their conquest, in the end he was left with only a drunken uncle, traumatized by loss. He'd return only to find a sobbing mess on the couch, who'd immediately embrace him once he stepped inside. His uncle had turned to the ideals of Lenin when all else was lost to him; all else but Kliment. When his uncle learned he was now studying the man himself, his joy at the news was the first time Kliment could remember him truly being happy. And he knew he couldn't disappoint his family; his only family."

When Roman was seven he went to the local school and showed his talent for technical sciences - mostly math and basics of physics. Out of almost a hundred applicants, Roman was one of the first - a technical school for him was a chance - to improve himself, to help his family and his country.\n\n"Most of you don't know how it works or about its place in a factory. But that's the reason why you come here, right? So, let's start with the basics."\n\nRoman's hand got tired after writing all the functions of a lathe, main elements of it, and many more to his notebook. That machine looked like something out of this world, a centerpiece of a song of steel and fire. And their teacher said that a factory in Plesetsk has dozen of machines just like that! Roman was listening to every word of the lecture, trying to write down every small detail.

It had been hard, but now that the day had come it became clear that their efforts had paid off swimmingly. The lecture hall was practically overflowing with students, brought there both by interest and a hefty promotional campaign by the government, always interested in showcasing its scientific progress. The room was buzzing with excitement and potential as Semyonov took the stage.\n\n"First of all, I'd like to thank you all for coming here. Even your presence shows how far we have come as a people. My generation had hardships of our own, but for you, who never knew a Russia that was not at war, to have achieved so much with all that was against you is truly remarkable. Your generation, the chemists and engineers, writers and artists, scientists and scholars in so many other fields, will be the ones who bring the Soviet people back onto the world stage with aplomb. My generation was unable to keep the Union together. Yours will make it the pride of the entire world, so long as you keep working and striving to be better than the day before."\n\nSemyonov went on for slightly under an hour, constantly having to ask the audience to restrain their applause.

Production and industry led Russia through a modern kind of warfare, and collectivization freed the peasants and the poor of Russia.\n\nAnd yet, Suslov knew there was still a long way to go. The Siberian government stands in the way of revolution and true communism, oppressing the workers and farmers alike. Meanwhile, the Germans sit waiting in Europe, murdering and enslaving those who oppose them. The Japanese as well occupy much of the Far East, including Vladivostok, stealing from Russians and occupying Russian industry and resources.\n\nAll opposed Suslov's Russia, and all had to be defeated.

We will make sure all important people are supervised in our newly controlled territories, to make sure they do nothing unfavorable. More garrisons and infantry will be mobilized the West Siberia as well to track down any secret societies and neutralize their members.\n\nSnuffing the partisans out of their hideouts will also be the job of the army and our generals are sure they won't remain a threat for long.

Lately, his subject of attention had been on past failings of his Communist comrades during the last days of Bukharin's Soviet Union, a time of factionalism. The cold faced man had been wondering whom could be blamed for such discord incited failings?\n\nMikhail Suslov had been going over names: Lazar Kaganovich, Leon Trotsky, Vyacheslav Molotov. All of them had been personally involved themselves into factionalism, through backing a candidate for the post of General Secretary of the Soviet Union, backing themselves or instigated conflict in a dire period of history for the Union and its people: Trotsky had been part of the friction in the Union's early years after Lenin's death, having lusted to become General Secretary before ultimately losing to Bukharin, while Kaganovich and Molotov had been loyal lapdogs of Stalin in his own quest for the Soviet throne, though Suslov would've dismissed his name from the list if not for being an influenceable member of the party, susceptible to outside influences and merely those that his wife were sympathetic to.\n\nA slow realisation came to burgeon in his mind as the man continued to write, words flowing from the tips of his fingers.\n\n"Even if our party today is united and undivisible, it'd be foolish to say that it had always been the case. It has come to my attention that the actions of past members such as Kaganovich, Trotsky and Molotov might've been due to outside influences contrary to Lenin's ideals.\n\nOne would describle them as akin to cosmopolitan bankers, showing themselves to be prisonners of bourgeois Zionist ideology, a characteristic shared by rootless cosmopolites abroad. As evident by the subversive, anti-Soviet behavior of Kaganovich, Trotsky, and Molotov, ties to Zionist elements betrays a tendency to be beheld to capitalist foreign associations.""

Well, technically the first and only one of its kind here. Pure Soviet design and conception.

But Suslov remained human in spite of the image he tried to uphold, one that couldn't help but find himself wondering if his efforts in bringing the Soviet Union, one being run by democratic collective rule, will ever prove successful or if he'll fail like so many others before him: a footnote in history."

He shuttered, shoving it out as fast as it appeared. He leaned back in his chair, remembering the past couple months of his life.\n\nIt all seemed good, at first. Zhdanov, the Paramount Leader, offered him work on the new space program. Nikolai, a space lover since his childhood in Moscow, took him on the offer. Such a simple time. Then, he heard the rumors. Then the rumors became experiences, and experiences became nightmares as he was assigned to different projects, all somehow related to 'socialist utopian'.\n\nAnd he had done nothing but nod along, sign papers, and do everything to lay low. Sometimes, in the dead of night, when the only light that Nikolai had the pleasure of seeing was the swaying bulb in his bedroom or in the cubicles of the departments in whatever new building he was shuffled into, Nikolai wondered whether he was just as monstrous as Zhdanov, the man who signed off on every damnable experiment he had the displeasure of witnessing. Other times, Nikolai wondered whether his actions would do anything in the first place. Would his mother and father, those old revolutionaries, have been proud of him?\n\nIt didn't matter.

But, if she were to be asked about any of the myriad and fantastical scientific initiatives undertaken by the Federation's government, she could have offered little insight.\n\nSuch a response would have puzzled many, and led to a subset of the same questioning how she could therefore even call herself an Ultravisionary. Her response? That while Zhdanov and the others looked to the stars, she looked to the minds, faces, and identities of the millions of the people in the Federation.\n\nShe was one of, and certainly the most prominent, social ultravisionaries within the faction, focused on achieving radical and revolutionary leaps in progress of the population's social order. Methods of thought, tenets of instruction, particularities of language and, yes, even the very names people were given were all concepts that she intended to change. Change for the better.\n\nFurtseva knew that her social proposals and pursuits were deemed as less important than the scientific ones, but she also knew that while achievements in space would be limited to the few, achievements in the Federation's - and eventually the world's - social order would be transformational to the many, and she was prepared to work to achieve that dream.\n\nWhich made her position as the Federation's Foreign Minister so valuable. Zhdanov and the others might have thought relatively little about dealings with the outside world, but she saw it as an opportunity to prepare the ground - worldwide - for growth.\n\nGrowth that she would one day see achieved."

He thought she could help. And that request, proving that he had not even bothered to learn what her position on such pursuits were, was the greatest insult of all.\n\nFurtseva was used to it. As one of the vanishingly few women in the Presidium, let alone within the Ultravisionary faction, she was sought out by many for shows of support. As though her voice mattered more. Perhaps it did, in a sense, but only so far as it could be shown. Presented. Placed on a shelf to be pointed at as an 'example of the wide appeal of our policy,' whatever that policy may be. What she actually thought mattered little.\n\nWhich meant a lot of 'polite conversations' and 'nice dinners' with other politicians who chased after her, more interested in her biology than her position.

Her attention was drawn back to events when Zhdanov began pontificating about how the support of the people, of the no-doubt visionaries among the Federation's millions of ordinary citizens, was critical to the Presidium's efforts in securing technological dominance.\n\nAt first she had ignored the line. And then it was if she had been struck by lightning. So powerful was the moment that her mask cracked, if only for a second, and even then drawing several interested stares.\n\nShe had been struggling so hard to gain support from the scientists for initiatives in support of the socialist superculture that she knew was critical to create. But all she had to do was explain to them that a true socialist culture, united in visionary thought, could not but expend every effort, dedicate every joule in their being, towards the achievement of scientific greatness.\n\nThe scientists were empirical men, procedural men, and they implicitly accepted as fact that proper support and infrastructure was critical to the success of any experiment or feat of engineering. If she could only convey that proper social culture was just as important as the right carbon content of steel or the correct amperage of an applied current, then she could all but guarantee support.\n\nFurtseva allowed herself a small smile.

Moving to back the ruble with energy, as opposed to gold, silver, or national confidence itself? It seemed a mad proposition.\n\nBut both of them knew very well that when Andrei Zhdanov proposed something considered visionary, it could not be ignored. And so, together with Zhdanov himself, they worked late into the night. As they did, however, they could not but grow entranced by the idea. By how many problems it solved. By the radical transformation it would no doubt catalyze at all levels of society.\n\nImagine! A currency eternally backed by a local commodity, a commodity universally applicable! Workpower liberated towards positive communal uses! Freedom from the corrupting forces of speculation and manipulation!\n\nEven apart from the ideals the men could conceptualize, the direct benefits could not be overstated either. If currency was connected to energy, then as national energy output increased so too did currency supply, but absent inflationary practices. And, if such a scheme was introduced, the work of the state's planning organs could be immensely simplified, as citizen rations could be determined through a simple allocation of energy, rather than as a basket of goods.\n\nThere would be problems, yes, but what true visionary could disagree with what was offered? Or shrink from the challenge to what countless will surely say cannot be done? Not they, and so once the proposal was complete,, Zhdanov ordered that it be introduced in the Presidium as soon as possible.\n\nHe, and they, could not wait to get started."

Zhdanov spoke, passionately and at length, about the many positives. But he ignored one critical problem: that to do so would immediately destroy any and all of the hard-won confidence in the ruble, as well as rendering foreign exchange impossible besides. And the Federation was not prepared for the imposition of effective autarky.\n\nIn desperation, Shepilov looked to the voices he knew to be rational - those of Nikolai Kardashev and Yekaterina Furtseva - and to his immense relief found them to be equally as horrified as himself. Exchanging slight nods of support, they prepared themselves for yet another careful repudiation of a 'visionary' initiative.\n\nWhen the debate and vote later came, they managed to successfully argue for the 'delay' of the 'excellent' idea, 'until such time as the entirety of the motherland could be liberated from occupying forces.'\n\nShepilov knew that the issue would return in the future.

The 'visionary' initiatives proposed by Zhdanov himself, or by his adherents if permitted were, to a one, utterly insane on a national scale, and nobody but himself and vanishingly few others seemed to realize this.\n\nConcepts that should have existed only in university laboratories, that should only have received small grants, if any at all, were suddenly introduced at the Presidium, assigned national priority, and allocated billions of rubles. The criteria for which often could be traced back to 'because the Paramount Leader had a visionary idea.'\n\nIt was no way to run a small business, let alone a recovering great power like Russia, and Shepilov often felt like the only man willing to say so. The one saving grace, the one thing he gave thanks for, was the discretion his position gave him. As the man ultimately in charge of implementing financial policy he could, as much as possible, rein in spending when Zhdanov and his clique were not looking. Which, given their focus on devising new 'visionary' efforts, was often.\n\nHe only hoped he could continue to do so, and find some allies besides.

For every insane project he tempered, another was proposed. For every microwave cannon he delayed, a semiballistic transport aircraft was put into development. It never stopped. It was as if Zhdanov and his cohorts never slept.\n\nAnd the results, presented by the ledgers, were clear. Every time they were updated, reserves had decreased, the degree of deficit spending had increased, and creditors were willing to extend fewer and fewer resources. There was simply no way to reconcile the Federation's budget in order to support such 'visionary' initiatives while also ensuring basic civilian services in a nation still bearing the scars of decades of civil war.\n\nBut, try as he might, he could not build enough support in the Presidium to act as a proper counterbalance. Kardashev and Furtseva would back him, sometimes, but they had their own positions and goals to think about, and even together they could not entirely block a proposal. They could merely postpone. And he could not even act in such a way very often, if he wanted to keep his position at all.\n\nSoon, Shepilov knew, looking at the ledgers, the columns of which were written entirely in red ink, a threshold would be reached, and all his skill would not be enough to save the Federation.

An explorer of a period that would, in time, come to be known as one of abject recklessness. Of abject foolishness. Of, perhaps, abject insanity.\n\nHaving personally approved the funding of the campus, after expending his political capital in preventing a proposal for bullet train bridges from the Kola to Kanin Peninsulas, he knew that the resources spent on it could have otherwise allowed for significant increases in agricultural production in Central Siberia. On a project that could actually benefit the state in concrete fashion, both in the near- and long-term.\n\nBut that proposal had not been 'visionary' enough, and this one had. After all, without this complex, he remembered Chelomei proclaiming with absolute surety, how could they ever produce enough electroconductive fluid to permit exoplanetary mining operations?\n\nAs the director continued speaking at him, Shepilov turned to look at the buildings, ignoring the words. Would he, in time, revisit this place as a monument to works once thought 'great,' to those who thought ultravisionary projects an example of the might of the Federation?\n\nShepilov did not know.

He had expected a quiet setting, but as he had approached the room he could hear multiple voices speaking. So, with a huff, he listened at the door like an eavesdropper. It seemed people were being briefed on his theory.\n\n"Effectively, there are three levels of civilization. Planetary, Stellar and Galactic, each defined by the resident society's control over their energy. Type I civilizations hold the ability to use and store all of their planet's energy. Type II civilizations do the same with their solar system. Type III do the same with the galaxy. We, of course, are not at any of these, but as the he has said, we may yet be one day. What makes this man a true visionary is he believes we can become a Planetary Civilization through socialism and cultural unity."\n\nNikolai tensed up as he heard a gentle murmur of approval and discussion. Rising to his full height and bracing himself, Nikolai opened the door to find a small group of men gathered around a table, with Zhdanov himself at the head. Each of them had a copy of two of his recent papers in their hands with annotations scrawled over them. "There he is! Gentleman, this is Nikolai Kardashev. Nikolai, these are my most trusted advisors. It is a pleasure to meet you in the flesh." Zhdanov spoke quickly and moved to usher Kardashev into the room not letting him get a word in edgewise.\n\nFlustered, Kardashev began to respond, "Well uh, I see you are all familiar with my work. I take it this is not the one on one meeting you posed this as, is it sir?"\n\n"I'm afraid not.

He was not sure if that was still the case.\n\nThe catalyst for this change was the lunch he had just left with Vladimir Chelomei, one of the primary architects of the program as a whole. The man was undoubtedly a genius, and one whom Kardashev had long idolized. He was also, as Kardashev now knew, a man whose ideals were actively dangerous, not only to the space program, but for the Federation as a whole.\n\nWhile Kardashev had proposed reasonable exploration, the leveraging of zero-gravity environments for research, and a general program of safety and sustainability, Chelomei had almost immediately dismissed it. He, and the Paramount Leader as well, wanted nothing but the most ambitious projects possible.\n\nEnormous capsules and stations. Heavy-lift rockets using the most dangerous and unstable of fuel mixtures. Military applications. Not only was such a course indefensibly reckless, Kardashev knew, but it was also wholly unsustainable in terms of resources - human, financial, and otherwise.\n\nEven so, Kardashev thought upon reflection, what was he to do about it?

At that, Kardashev had fought back.\n\nHe wanted to see careful progress made in fundamental advances before any end-stage initiatives could be realized. And he wanted economic, scientific, and civil uses given priority. The look Chelomei had given him when he had mentioned such uses was withering.\n\nBut Kardashev would not back down. He was no longer just another scientist. He was a Commissar just like Chelomei was, and he would make sure his voice was heard.

For every genuinely good idea, such as hovercraft, biodomes, hybridized crops, nuke-proof towns, there were three genuinely awful ideas. These included constructing robotic harnesses that would latch onto corpses and then be propelled by the inevitable miasma, a gun that would fire a ray into the head of the user to allow them to remember any event (extremely radioactive), and a highly improbable suggestion that proposed a species of regenerating cattle that could be used for infinite meat.\n\nYuri sighed.

Alcohol, tobacco smoke, and the occasional flirtatious caress flowed freely between the occupants, as deviant discussion and fraught revisionism filled the air.\n\nOn the periphery of the basement, between a young man who was excitedly sharing a passage from his newly written pamphlet, and a red-clad woman who was scandalously stroking her hair, a striking black-clad woman reclined, engrossed in the sounds and experiences. She noted the words spoken, and the materials shared; the substances consumed and acts carried out. Even as she turned her head to break the law one more time that night, each action was entered into her trained mental litany.\n\nThe woman, of course, was a member of the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances, a star agent of the United Soviet Federation's infamous spy agency. Throughout the gathering, there were no less than three informants - one in each "cell" of the so-called "Visionary Humanist Society". She avoided acknowledging them as she processed the young man's statement about "voluntary auto-collectivization" and "inherent noospheric individualism" - important ideological concepts that would have to be noted.\n\nThe "Anarcho-Ultravisionarist" society that surrounded her, in truth, was not a threat in totality. Their rank-and-file could be scattered to the winds at a token threat of force, and their leaders merely given a touch of re-education. Their minds were in the right place - but their hearts bled for far too many.\n\nWith one last taste of lipstick, she excused herself to both of her new associates, and slipped into the night - a stack of pamphlets tucked into her handbag, and a list of names burned into her memory."

With a practiced step, he slipped into the lobby and down the hall, checking the locks on his door for signs of tampering. Satisfied by the result, he unlocked them - just the first and third, as was custom, and stepped inside.\n\nHis heart nearly stopped, as he looked at the unassuming black-clad man sitting at the table in his kitchen, smoking a cigarette. His hand dropped to his coat pocket, where he kept his revolver, before freezing. The man's voice cut through the silence, interrupting his breathing.\n\n"Comrade Lebedev, Vasily Alexandrovich. Good evening."\n\nHe didn't have a response for that, instead searching the man for insignia. Nothing. A trickle of ice dripped down his spine, as he made the connection.\n\n"So. What am I being arrested for?"\n\nThe man chuckled, before beckoning for him to sit down.\n\n"Consider yourself innocent, Comrade Lebedev. I have a proposition for you.

Of course, now you'd be working for us. Special Circumstances. Everything you do for us would be hush-hush."\n\nVasily cracked a smile at that. He'd heard rumors, of course... but he'd never imagined he'd be approached.\n\n"A spy?"\n\n"A spy, but with excellent benefits. An agent of the Federation - rather than a mere guard for the Mountain.."\n\nHe wasn't surprised. SC was rumoured to be the absolute peak of the intelligence apparatus.

Do this for a day. See if you like the way we operate."\n\nVasily mulled it over. 'What color is the uniform?'\n\nThe man smiled, an expression that carried no lack of malice.

 kurchatov.1.d:0 "When Igor Kurchatov, the Vice Premier of the Presidium, announced a surprise addition to the agenda at the end of a meeting, many of its members feared what possible surprise they were going to spring on them. Perhaps, some thought, it was a scientific proposal that he couldn't wait to shove down their throats, knowing his status as Zhdanov's successor made him immune to normal parliamentary procedures. Others, more paranoid, feared it was the beginning of a round of purges, to prepare the way for Kurchatov's eventual takeover.\n\nAs it happened, neither of those possibilities happened.\n\n"Comrades," he began, his voice trembling a little, "I regret to inform you that I will be retiring from public life as soon as I am free to do so."\n\nThe room collectively held its breath, as he continued, stating that his age made his position as Vice Premier a "burden" and that "a newer, younger generation" would best be sought to replace him in six month's time, his official retirement date. What double entendres occurred were obvious, as Zhdanov, sitting right beside him, looked nervously at the members of the Presidium.\n\nWhen Kurchatov finished, he was greeted with applause from the Presidium and Zhdanov. The chamber even passed a resolution with debate thanking him for his service to his countryman and to the worker's movement. But few could ignore the new energy in the room, as the fears and ambition of men came towards the fore."

A portent had been simultaneously observed and understood.\n\nAnd, just as quickly, it was answered. Kurchatov announced to the two men that he would, in the very near future, be announcing his retirement. The time had come for change, he had said, both for the Federation and for himself, and he had no intention of overstaying his welcome.\n\nBoth Kardashev and Chelomei immediately understood the situation and their own place within it, as both saw their opportunity to replace Kurchatov and thereby increase their influence over the Federation's direction. It would be a difficult case to make, indeed, but the reward was well worth it.\n\nWorking hard not to betray their intentions to the other, or to Kurchatov himself, the two men offered their support for their superior's decision as well as their thanks for his long and successful service, and departed soon after. Once out of sight, however, they began to move with increased speed.\n\nThe race was on. For the position itself, of course, but also for securing the political support needed to obtain it."

However; Vladimir hadn't been the only one called. Nikolai Kardashev, that bumbling, nervous, yet simultaneously brilliant idealist was his competition- and the race was on. Back into his office at the People's Commissariat of Defense he strutted; giving nods to officers and staffers as he sat at his seat.\n\nThe race was on; and he'd need to get as much support as he could- Furtseva, Varennikov and Zhdanov himself were easy support- the committees could bend his way, and even Semichastny's enigmatic Special Circumstances Directorate could probably be reasoned with; leaving it an easy climb... unless Kardashev could steal his support. The Old Reformers had to be silenced, his position had to be solidified...\n\nWhat seemed like an easy cakewalk was becoming more and more of a challenge; much to his annoyance.

Unless he could somehow convince Zhdanov, the committees... A pause, as he sprinted towards his office at the People's Commissariat of Energy, taking names. Numbers. The intelligence services. Old Reformers. Oplesnin. The People's Commissar of Industry- and he'd have to convince several of them. Vladmir Chelomei was charismatic and suave- yet abrasive and self assured. There was still a chance; but Kardashev couldn't sit on his laurels and just hope.

The cause of Ultravisionary Socialism had advanced tremendously, and while the Paramount Leader was of course the man most responsible for that advancement, he knew he had been instrumental in helping him do so. But the time had come to hand over the reins, and enjoy a retirement long deserved.\n\nKurchatov had seen the looks in both Kardashev and Chelomei's eyes when he had told them of his decision. It was, after all, why he had summoned them. Both had seen a chance to replace him, and he was sure that, even now, they were frantically moving to secure support. It would be a most interesting competition to watch, especially since he did not particularly care about the outcome.\n\nBoth men, despite their vastly different outlooks, were visionaries. Both would hold the Federation in secure hands. Both would continue its journey towards the future - in all fields.\n\nAnd at that thought, he smiled again."

You want my support for you to become Vice Premier."\n\n"Yes, comrade, and that's why I have come to you before all others. Your magnificent work in strengthening and upholding the Ultravisonary superculture has been nothing short of amazing. The projects you and your Commissariat have proposed continue to show promising results, and I do not wish to see them scrapped anytime soon. If you back me as Vice Premier, I'll ensure ample support and funding comes to your Commissariat so that you can continue your work however you please. Do you find that agreeable?"

Eventually, Kardashev was able to find Dmitri Shepilov's small office, the door squeaking as he entered the room.\n\n"You want me to support you as Vice Premier?" asked Shepilov, his voice full of apprehension.\n\n"Yes, comrade, I do. I understand that the current policies and budgets-"\n\n"What budgets?! Every half-baked madman is given a blank check without so much as a glance towards my office!"\n\nKardashev paused to allow Shepilov to calm down before continuing, "Y-Yes, comrade, I am fully aware.

As of late, factionalism, that old devil of all socialist movements, had begun to rear its ugly head within the communists of the United Soviet Federation. Zhdanov, he sincerely hoped, would recognize the potential dangers ahead.\n\n"Comrade Zhdanov," said Chelomei, breaking the sacred silence that hung over the office, the senior party official looking up from his paperwork. He smiled, his fleshy face spreading into a grin.\n\n"Ah, Vladimir, welcome. Forgive me, I was lost in the day-to-day of statework. Take a seat and make yourself at home."\n\nChelomei nodded and did so, scooting closer to the oaken desk. "Comrade Zhdanov, I will be frank: the party is not as impregnable to fragmentation as we would like to believe. I am not here to make accusations against anyone, that is far outside my purview," Chelomei added quickly as Zhdanov frowned. "We must face the facts, Comrade Zhdanov, you are not immortal. One day, the time will come to seek a replacement."\n\nZhdanov nodded, "of course, Vladimir. Don't think I can't smell the wolves circling around us.

"Please, Comrade Kardashev, you may begin." Kardashev nodded, sweat forming on his brow from the heat of the projector and his own nerves.\n\n"What I am most pleased to present to you, Comrade Zhdanov, is the potential for a fusion-based fuel economy. Petroleum will, as we know, run dry. If we are looking towards the future, towards the stars, we need an unlimited source of fuel."\n\nZhdanov nodded, silently urging Kardashev to continue. "The answer is fusion. With the proper materials we could provide unlimited energy for the Soviet Federation and for our space program."\n\nZhdanov held up a hand, "you're speaking of a long, God, long term project.

Do not concern yourself overmuch with matters of state, but know that your project will come to rest in capable hands.

Vladimir Chelomei, a lurker in the halls of power, had apparently been secreted away with Comrade Zhdanov in unofficial meetings. The implications of this were less than stellar for Kardashev: he likely no longer had Zhdanov's ear in the succession matter.\n\nKardashev slid back into his chair, absently rubbing his race. What was his next move? If Zhdanov couldn't be counted upon to have his back, then who could? He felt isolated, trapped in the center of a great web: the most horrible aspect of which was not knowing where the spider was."

Chelomei had not announced his intentions from the start, but the man's demeanour meant that he knew something was up. "Hello, comrade," began Chelomei, not unkindly, "I'm not going to ask you to confirm or deny anything, anonymity is key to us both at this juncture."\n\nA nervous scoff, a forced laugh, "what are you talking about?

Now, all he had to do was push things forwards.\n\n"Hold tight, comrade," he said, extending a hand to gently touch the top of the nervous man's fingers, "stay to your posts and when the time is right, I'm certain you will come through for me." The meeting was concluded, the two conspirators, for that is what they were now, departed on their separate ways. Chelomei breathed a sigh of relief.

Kardashev wasn't a brilliant wordsmith, his delivery awkward and his tone clear, but it worked its intended effect upon Yuri.\n\n"Yes, of course!" said Yuri suddenly, clear excitement on his face. He beamed, subtly eased. "My friend, I'll be sure to pass along the message. Regrettably, looking at the time, I'm afraid I must take my leave."

Sliding the latch on his door, he peered out into the street and saw no sign of a postal worker - this letter had been delivered by hand.\n\nOpening the envelope, he began to read.\n\n"Dear Mr. Kardashev\n\nYou do not know who I am, and I would like to keep it that way, as my position in this country is tenuous.

 kurchatov.17.d:0 ""I am glad to be able to speak with you in private, Comrade Keldysh," said Chelomei as he sat down with the People's Commissar of Science. Such a powerful ally would be invaluable in Chelomei's bid for Kurchatov's position.\n\n"We both know why you're here. What can you offer me that other candidates won't? WHy should the People's Commissariat of Science support you?"\n\n"I'm glad you asked. The People's Commissariat of Science is an invaluable asset of the Federation. However, we're squandering that asset's potential by spreading it too thin. We need to focus your efforts, ensure that your efforts do not go to waste. I think the People's Commissariat should focus on projects that strengthen our army, and strengthen the revolution."\n\n"Do elaborate, comrade. I'm interested in hearing what projects this would entail."\n\n"I'm talking about things like rockets. Alternative forms of weaponry. Even mind control. If the revolution is to succeed, then we need to obtain every advantage possible. There will of course be funding for more mundane science, but that type of thing doesn't really fit the Ultravisionary spirit, now does it?"\n\n"You've certainly intrigued me comrade, I must admit. Could I ask you to repeat some of that again? I want to have written proof so that I don't forget anything later.""
 kurchatov.17.a:0 ""I want to bring the Revolution brought to Mars by 1980, and we'll need your brilliance to get there.""

 kurchatov.18.d:0 "Chelomei looked over the unopened letter in his hands. He had made some bold promises to Mstislav Keldysh, and he hoped that Keldysh would see the opportunities that Chelomei could provide. He took out his letter opener, and extracted the paper. Clearly the People's Commissar of Science had written the document in a hurry, and Chelomei had to squint to decipher the man's handwriting.\n\n"Comrade Chelomei,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nThat is why I have decided to support you for Vice Premier, and you can depend upon my vote when the time comes on the Presidium. I hope you uphold your promises. I understand you expect great things from us, but we also expect great things of you."\n\nChelomei leaned back in his chair, a smile stretching across his face. This was good news. Chelomei was getting ever closer to that coveted Vice Premiership. With the People's Commissariats for Foreign Affairs and Science on his side, the core pillars of Ultravisionary Socialism were on Chelomei's side."
 kurchatov.18.a:0 "Great minds think alike, comrade."

 kurchatov.19.t:0 "Impartial Science"
 kurchatov.19.d:0 "Chelomei opened the envelope and pulled out Mstislav Keldysh's letter. He felt like his conversation with the People's Commissar of Science had been productive, and hoped that this letter carried good news. The letter was handwritten, and it took a moment for Chelomei to decipher the letter's contents.\n\n"Comrade Chelomei,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nHowever, science must always strive to be impartial. The People's Commissariat of Science is an important pillar of the Federation, and we must not let our revolution fall into factionalism. As such, I can not in good faith commit to any candidates at this time..."\n\nChelomei crumpled up the letter and threw it in the garbage bin by his feet. Impartiality! Factionalism! What nonsense! At least they were remaining neutral on the matter. CHelomei could salvage this, there were still potential allies that he could sway to his side."

In regards to the matter of Kurchatov's retirement, I think you would be an excellent choice for his successor.

Keldysh hadn't seemed particularly enthusiastic when he left Kardashev's office, but Kardashev had thought that their conversation had been very productive. Today, however, his secretary stopped him as he was entering his office, carrying a folded piece of paper. It was from Keldysh.\n\n"Comrade Kardashev,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nHowever, science must always strive to be impartial.

As such, I can not in good faith commit to any candidates at this time. I hope, as a fellow scientist, you can understand my position. We merely wish the best for the Federation, and we only wish the best for science."\n\nKardashev put the paper down on his desk. That wasn't good.

 kurchatov.23.t:0 "The Long Search"
 kurchatov.23.d:0 "Vladmir Chelomei was not used to asking for directions or instructions from people; nor was he used to receiving anything that wasn't a straight answer. Thus when he started asking people for the location of the basement of the People's Commissariat of Aquatic Transport, he was not expecting evasiveness.\n\nHe certainly wasn't expecting the first response to be "What basement?" as the receptionist eyed him with confusion. "The basement. Do not take me for a fool; I wish to speak with the Director of Special Circumstances." "Who is... in our basement." She replied, giving him a look of utter derision. "Which doesn't exist. I have been here for years, and we've never-" Onto the next person, while she stared at him dumbfoundedly.\n\n"I am here looking for Special Circumstance's headquarters- where is the basement?"\n\n"What basement?" Vladimir blinked. "The basement. Special Circumstances headquarters..." "Comrade, in my many years of working here, we have never had a basement."\n\nThey can't be serious, can they? This has to be some form of joke, or some private mockery. Is Semichastny working with Kardashev, or was the location Chelomei was given wrong? No, no, it can't be wrong- Chelomei himself personally traced the rumors. Clearly, these people are either mocking him or simply idiots. Thus, he continued his long search. "I am looking for the basement." He stated- as he swung open a door dramatically. Closet. Bathroom. Storage room. "What basement?" Break room. Office. "The basement, comrade. I know you have one. Stop trying to hide it from me." Could it be a trapdoor? Behind a bookshelf? It has to be somewhere. If Vladmir Chelomei-\n\nA pause, as a hand taps on his shoulder, before resting on it. "Follow me, comrade." A voice spoke, as a black clothed, plain looking individual walked towards the closet he had swung open, entering- and opening a door behind a grouping of uniforms and shoeboxes, turning to him."
 kurchatov.23.a:0 ""In.""

 kurchatov.231.t:0 "The Basement"
 kurchatov.231.d:0 "The headquarters of the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances was large. It was far less of a basement and more of a sublevel of the building; with plenty of spacious offices, monitoring stations, and staff flooding through it. Agents in matte black uniforms with swordlike emblems strutted to and fro without a care, and Vladmir Chelomei did his best to hold his tongue- despite spending thirty five minutes hunting for such a large location. "Where is Semichastny's office? I need to speak to him about urgent-"\n\n"Follow." The agent leading him spoke, moving to a large room covered in chairs, firmly pausing once he was inside. "Wait."\n\nFor a moment, Chelomei considered his options- before sitting down in a chair and waiting. There was no television. There were no books. There were no other individuals waiting, and aside from the cold comfort of the quiet agent, Vladimir Chelomei was alone. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity the door opened, and he was led in utter silence to a desk. Plain, aside from the same swordlike emblem on the front of it that the agents seemed to have, and only having one occupant- Vladimir Semichastny, who was looking at papers.\n\n"I-" "Am here to ask for my support." Semichastny interrupted, not even bothering to look up. "You have it." Chelomi blinked, as the agent motioned to the door, and Semichastny did not give him so much as a passing glance. The only acknowledgement he got was a single reflexive look up as the door shut between the two- as the agent led Chelomei up and out."

 kurchatov.24.t:0 "Long Hours"
 kurchatov.24.d:0 "Nikolai Kardashev had no clue where the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances was; and apparently neither did anyone else. No matter who he asked, there didn't seem to be an answer. Rather- a straight answer. "I'm pretty sure it's in...one of those buildings." An aide pointed to a map, as Nikolai blinked, before nodding as he made his way through and around them. The Directorate of Agriculture? No. "Perhaps if you'd try the People's Commissariat of Aquatic Transport..." No. "I don't know who told you to look here, but perhaps..."\n\nDown more streets he walked, and got more and more dismissals, or directions that led nowhere- before a single flicker of hope. A single, matte black clad woman in a leather coat stood at a street corner with a cigarette in her mouth, a small accessory to their apathetic stare as they observed his approach. "Excuse me, Ma'm. I am looking for the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances. I would like to meet with Vladimir Semichastny to discuss-"\n\n"Special Circumstances?" The woman interrupted, taking the cigarette out of her mouth as Kardashev blinked. "Special Circumstances for what? What kind of Special Circumstances are we in, comrade?" She asked, tone inquisitive- even as her facial expression refused to change."

 kurchatov.241.t:0 "The Letter"
 kurchatov.241.d:0 "The first thing on Nikolai Kardashev's mind when he found the note on his desk was that he recalled locking the door. In fact, he specifically remembered locking it before leaving- and yet, nothing was missing. Nothing had been overturned, or removed, or destroyed. All that was different was a single note on his desk with a badge- complete with a hexagonal sword-and-orbit emblem that he knew as connected to Special Circumstances, and he had recalled locking the door. That wasn't in here before he had left; had they broken in, deposited the note, and broken out? More importantly- the note.\n\n"To People's Commissar Nikolai Kardashev."\n\n"You have my support- and your persistence is an admirable quality. We will likely see each other in the future. Vladimir Semichastny."\n\nAny of the individuals outside of the office likely noted a small outburst of excitement, followed by a large sigh of relief."

 kurchatov.25.d:0 "When the most pro-military of two candidates goes to a meeting of generals, he expects applause. Accolades. Cheers. All of these things are exactly what Vladmir Chelomei gets in spades- from Varennikov, while Oplesnin simply smiles politely. "Gentlemen. You are several of the greatest military minds of our time- and beyond that. You already know what I am here to ask for. Need I continue?"\n\nWith that, Chelomei falls silent with a smirk- and waits patiently. A passive observer to the rest of the meeting would have called the decision inevitable- which to an extent in Vladmir's eyes, it was. "You have our support, of course. Only you can lead us into the future." Varennikov spoke, beaming as the others applauded. It was all easy- too easy. Yet, there was no opposition. No one raised their voice, or debated against him in the slightest, or did anything to question or deviate. It was almost eerie how in sync the entire thing was; but Chelomei put these thoughts aside. Of course they'd pick him. After all, he was their superior- and the clear choice."
 kurchatov.25.a:0 "No surprises here."

 kurchatov.26.t:0 "A Meeting of Somewhat Like Minds"
 kurchatov.26.d:0 "The moment Kardashev sat down across from Nikolai Oplesnin, he knew, from the hard look in the general's eyes, that he had his work cut out for him.\n\nHe needed to demonstrate support from the military in order to advance his claim on the Vice Premiership, and while he had been told Oplesnin was naturally sympathetic to his viewpoints on political and economic matters, the general was not going to give him his endorsement for free. That would come with a cost.\n\nAnd, so, Kardashev spoke at length about his plans for the military, should he be so endorsed. He spoke of a more efficient intelligence apparatus. About increasing the military's efficiency in all matters. About the absolute necessity for encouraging an apolitical nature within the armed forces, and thereby ensure state stability.\n\nOplesnin listened patiently, and Kardashev could tell that he, in general, quite liked what he heard. But, and most critically for any statement of support, he had not yet been told how much effort and political capital Kardashev was willing to spend to achieve the transformations promised.\n\nAnd that decision would make all the difference."
 kurchatov.26.a:0 "Promise him some effort."
 kurchatov.26.b:0 "Promise him more effort."
 kurchatov.26.c:0 "Promise him even more effort."

 kurchatov.27.d:0 "Kardashev had not realized he had been holding his breath until the moment Oplesnin offered, in response to his entreaty, a slight nod. It was as if a weight had been removed from his chest.\n\nAs Oplesnin began to speak, some of that weight returned. But not nearly as much as he had feared, when first sitting down. The general was very clear that he supported Kardashev's goals for the military establishment, and that he was convinced that the promise would, at the very least, be fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.\n\nHe would not, however, openly support Kardashev's candidacy. As had been said, an apolitical military was a laudable and critical goal, and could not but be exemplified in the present. What he would do, however, was remain abjectly neutral in a personal sense. He would also work to ensure the rest of the General Staff behaved similarly.\n\nStanding and shaking hands, Kardashev turned to leave. It was not all he had wanted, but as the general had said, exemplifying - and thus proving - the belief of apoliticity was important. In addition and at the very least, though he was not receiving an endorsement from the military establishment, neither was Chelomei.\n\nAnd, Kardashev decided, that was good enough."
 kurchatov.27.a:0 "The best outcome reasonably possible."

 kurchatov.28.t:0 "Somewhat Like Minds Diverge"

It was as if the sudden weight that he felt on his chest had been increased tremendously.\n\nAs Oplesnin began to speak, it only continued to do so. The general was very clear that he was not convinced of Kardashev's drive to implement the promises made, and that, while he supported the ideas in general, he would not extend that support towards the candidacy for the Vice Premiership.\n\nAt least, and to Kardashev's extreme consternation, not to his own candidacy. Oplesnin made it clear that he, and the military in general, could not but support his rival. Chelomei was, after all, the People's Commissar for Defense as well as the military's superior, and all boons they had so far received had come through him. As well as an intelligent and committed man besides. To scorn that largesse would be a slight not forgotten, by anyone.\n\nStanding and shaking hands in a most perfunctory manner, Kardashev turned to leave. He had to fight to conceal his disappointment. It might have been naive of him to expect any other outcome, but he had all the same.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, his loss was Chelomei's gain."

"Gentleman of the board, it is an honor to speak to you. As you know I have been looking into becoming the vice premier of the federation, and it would be in your best interest to endorse my candidacy in the Presidium."\n\n"I believe the federation has not gone far enough to expand ultravisionary superculture into the stars, even going into defunding research into the fields of space exploration and conquest. I know as well that the acquirement of resources has been an issue, with less than enough to come close to the development of rocket technology. With the tide coming closer to an ultravisionary socialist united Russia, I assure you that your needs will be met! Russia will enter into the stars and soviet weaponry and technology will spread throughout the galaxy. Kardashev will only ignore the greatness we can achieve with the militarization of space, but I promise that I will not ignore this tenet of ultravisionism, and this board will get what it needs to conquer the stars!"\n\nWith the conclusion of his speech, Chelomei expected a standing ovation. All he got was a cough. A balding man stood up out of his seat, obviously the chairman. "Comrade Chelomei, we are thankful for your support, but we need more... specific promises. We have long dealt with vague assurances of funding year after year, yet we receive nothing when the time comes. What will you ensure the Board will receive?"\n\n"Chelomei paused, knowing he needed the support of the board, but what to promise them? Promising them too much would be costly for the future, but not enough would surely offer him little support. He stood quietly for a moment, then blurted-""

"Comrade Chelomei, you have your endorsement!"\n\nChelomei smiled and stepped off the podium as the board began to formally vote to endorse him, looking as if it was unanimous. He had done it, and the Board for Intersolar Activities was a very important ally as well. He just hoped he hadn't promised too much, but he wouldn't have to worry about that yet.\n\nGrabbing a glass of water, one of the board members patted him on the back, saying, "I just wanted to thank you personally, Comrade Chelomei. It seems you higher-ups have finally shown they truly care about socialist space exploration. I do hope you uphold your promise if you are elected."\n\nChelomei glanced down, then back at the board member.

We were selected to be a part of this board to not worry about political matters, and it is better off if we do not intervene in the Presidium's decision. We hope you understand."\n\nChelomei sighed, all that effort for nothing. "Thank you for inviting me anyway, gentlemen, comrades.

As you know, my goal to become the next Vice Premier is still ongoing, and I need as much support in the Presidium as I can get, which you can provide. Now, my proposals for a better space program are much different than some others of the Presidium. I know many who have promised the militarization of space and millions of other things, many unachievable. Instead of a militarized space program, I propose a more peaceful one."\n\n"One where we explore the stars, not out to conquer in the name of socialism, but to learn, and to improve our own self. To be honest, it will be a challenge, but one we can overcome and not impossible."\n\nKardeshev paused, seeing what the responses from the board were and continued, "I also propose a peaceful answer to ensure we gain resources from our stars, space industrialization. Instead of militarizing space, we must use it to our advantage! Unending resources in our hands only, our supremacy of technology bringing us forward! Without competition from the imperialists, we will rise!"\n\nEnding his speech, Kardeshev anticipated the board's reaction. The chairman was beginning to look interested. "I like where your ideas are coming from, comrade Kardeshev, but the industrialization of space sounds like a difficult task. What can you promise to make it worth all the effort that must be put into it?""

"Your speech has been very persuasive, I believe you have your endorsement."\n\n"Thank you, and I promise I will do all I can as your Vice Premier." On that note, Kurchatov stepped off the podium as the board began their official vote to extend their endorsement to him, looking as if it were unanimous. Grabbing a glass of water, Kardashev reflected to himself. Would he be able to get the board what they wanted? The Federation already short on funds after years of war and development, and it would only get worse. But then again, Zhdanov had always been confident during the speeches he had given. As his Vice Premier, he would make sure the federation achieved what every person in Russia dreamed of, no matter the cost.\n\nA true socialist civilization was coming, and it wouldn't stop until it hit the very edges of the galaxy."

"I'm sorry, Comrade Kardashev, while your promise does sound enticing, the industrialization of space still sounds like a daunting task. We have also collectively decided we cannot endorse any candidate, as we do not want to involve ourselves in political matters.\n\nKardashev's eyes lowered to the ground. "I understand your decision, but I do hope you know that I will uphold my promise if I do become Vice Premier. I want nothing more than to see our federation exploring the stars, but I know you are the ones who will do it.

Said Sheremetyev, straightening out the papers scattered across his desk and fixing his posture. The door swung open and in came Chelomei, with his own neat stack of papers clasped against his chest.\n\n"Comrade Sheremetyev, good to see you." Began Chelomei. Sheremetyev simply nodded in response before looking up.\n\n"Good to see you aswell. I don't have a lot of time so lets get down to business. What is it you wanted to talk to me about today?"\n\n"I've noticed that there has been more and more strain on your Commissariat as our territory grows and people expect more amenities. I have a solution that would make both our jobs easier, but I can't put it into practice until I'm chosen as Vice Premier. Can I count on your support?"\n\nCautious but intrigued, Sheremetyev replied, "Well, what is it? I can't decide unless you give me something to work off of."\n\nWith a thump, Chelomei dropped the entire stack of papers onto the table. Sheremetyev peered onto the first page, reading the title of the dossier: "Visionary Social Commitments."\n\n"Exactly what it says in bold.

What did you think of it, then?"\n\n"At first I was skeptical, I admit - I'm so used to working with machines, I'm not too well versed in sociology or anything like that. But, the numbers seem right and the concept is well thought out. If this were put into action, well, I'd have to mock up a proper projection to get a real number, but efficiency would almost certainly improve."\n\n"So, I can count on your support, then?"\n\n"Of course, comrade. You proved yourself both honest and efficient. Have a wonderful day." Finished Sheremetyev before hanging up. Chelomei placed his own telephone down and turned back to his desk.

But, nonetheless, there was Alexander's voice on the other end.\n\n"Good afternoon, Comrade. Allow me to just say - what the hell, Vladimir? What's your game?"\n\nStartled and confused, Chelomei sputtered a reply, "Wh-what do you mean, Comrade?"\n\n"Your proposal is bullshit. I read it and felt a little suspicious of your numbers so I had some of my own analysts go over it and you know what they said? 'His proposal is bullshit'."\n\nAfter taking a deep breath, and silently cursing himself, Chemolei sighed. "I suppose this means I can't count on your support in my pursuit of Vice Premier, then?"\n\n"Sounds about right, comrade. Next time you're looking for support, either be more honest or find someone as dishonest as yourself." Sheremetyev hung up, and Chemolei sat at his desk staring out his window in shock.\n\n"Bastard."

Shrugging, although a little worried that his lack of punctuality would cause him to catch the Commissar off guard, he knocked on the door.\n\nSheremetyev's voice could be heard through the wood, beckoning Kardashev to come in. Entering the office, Kardashev saw the Commissar sitting amid a mound of paperwork stacked on his desk. The two men greeted eachother, friendly but curt, before Kardashev got right down to business.\n\n"I know you must be busy, but I've had some ideas I think you might want to look into."\n\n"Ideas, you say?" Replied Sheremetyev.\n\n"Yes. I've been doing some research, and some thinking, and I think I have an idea of how we could vastly increase productivity here in the industry sector... provided I make Vice Premier."\n\n"Really, now?" Sheremetyev, cautious but interested. "Could you explain some of it to me?"\n\n"Sure! And here, I've written some projections down as well." Kardashev added, placing down yet another stack of papers. Kardashev then sat down, going through his plans, ideas and promises while the Commissar frantically took notes. When all was said and done, Kardashev stood up. "Thank you for meeting with me today. I hope I can count on your support for my efforts towards becoming Vice Premier."\n\n"I'll have to look over your work, but... I'm sure it will check out.""

Kardashev nodded, before realizing the gesture was pointless on a phone call.\n\n"I looked over your notes, and the ones I took during our conversation, with a few of my analysts. I admit, at first I was skeptical with how far reaching and optimistic your ideas were, but they seem both achievable and efficient. With you in the position of Vice Premier, I'm positive we could make a change for the better in this country's industry."\n\n"That's great news! Thank you, Comrade."\n\n"Of course, of course.

Kardashev was shocked, and was already reddenning in embarrassment.\n\n"Apparently not enough. The numbers are all wrong, made-up technologies are implemented - and things like safety precautions and costs are completely left out at some points. It's just all too much of a reach, Nikolai. You're always looking so far ahead without even thinking about how your plans might end up. I want a Vice Premier who is capable of honesty about the feasibility of his goals. Your papers tell of a man who doesn't quite know how to get where he's going. I'm sorry." Kardashev's phone clicked as Sheremetyev hung up his own.

I'm sure you have heard already I am looking forwards to becoming the next Vice Premier, and it is now my responsibility to gain support from all around the government, you included. Which is why I decided to come up with a new innovation that will change your jobs forever. I call it Visionary Management Techniques, and it will rebuild this entire bureau! New methods of administration and bureaucracy, all to make your jobs easier!"\n\n"With what though?" A tweedy man in the back interrupted. "We've done everything we can to make things easier, that's part of our job. There's nothing left to improve pen and paper."\n\nAh, but that's the thing," said Chelomei. "We will do away with the nonvisionary pen and paper, via computerization! Machines will lead bureaucracy into a new age of wonder, and I assure you your jobs will be made twice as easier!"\n\nThe manager approached the front of the room, saying, "This all sounds amazing, Comrade Chelomei, but what is the timeframe we are looking at to have our Commissariat modernized?""

I have discovered a new way to transform government administration, called cybernetic management. Cybernetic management is the way of the future, and it is closer than you may think. Without much in complex technology or the dependence on computers, an important bureau such as yours could be twice as productive. With cybernetic management, a full reorganization of the management and work process could create peak administrative efficiency. I also propose more automation in the workplace, giving computers more menial tasks and making sure everyone knows their job. With computers taking the less desirable work, the worker can be managed like a well-oiled machine.""

Kardashev had expended all of his other options, leaving only one decision left.\n\nKardashev sighed. He didn't want to do this, but his hands were tied.

He pledged to do so.\n\nThe applause was, of course, unanimous. It was also, Kardashev could tell, perfunctory. He would have to work hard to secure support from many who did not trust him, and who clearly thought, judging by the glances thrown towards the man, that Chelomei should have been standing in his spot.\n\nBut as Paramount Leader Kardashev stepped down from the platform, he knew that he could. He had always been a hard worker, and this was just one more challenge to overcome."

 kardashev.3.d:0 "Nikolai Kardashev sat in the chair he had spent years standing in front of. The Paramount Leader's chair. Zhdanov's chair. His chair.\n\nHe was still, in truth, processing the change. Ever since his elevation to Vice-Premier he had of course known it was coming, especially with Zhdanov's declining health, but knowing and experiencing were, as many had told him, very different things. So far, he had coped with the shift through focusing on other things.\n\nThings such as the workmen carefully and respectfully packaging Zhdanov's personal effects, for distribution to family or state museums as indicated by his will and final wishes. It would not be long before he had to move his own effects in to replace them. There was much more space to fill. Physically and metaphorically.\n\nTurning his mind to the future, Kardashev swiveled the chair and looked out the enormous windows. He was the Federation's steward now, and he knew there would have to be change. Many of the Federation's programs were simply unsustainable, and though he had no idea how to begin unravelling the dense network of unnecessary commissions and project boards that were so prevalent, he was keenly aware of the need to figure it out. Quickly.\n\nIt was time to, as best as he was able, get to work."

 chelomei.1.t:0 "An Ultravisionary Visit"
 chelomei.1.d:0 "Leaving the hospital, Vladimir Chelomei struggled to reconcile determination with shock. He knew now that Andrei Zhdanov was not long for this world.\n\nSummoned in the dark of night and driven by Zhdanov's bodyguards to the hospital, he had fought to keep himself composed when he saw the man. Zhdanov was a figure who had always been larger than life, dominating every room he was in, and now he looked sick. Weak. Old, for the first time ever.\n\nWorse, he could barely speak. Could barely leverage the talent that, along with a visionary mind had been, more than anything else, responsible for the Federation even existing in the first place. But he had struggled through, and though his words were halting, Zhdanov spoke to Chelomei. Told him that he knew he was going to die. Told him that he had to keep the vision moving forward.\n\nChelomei had been quick to pledge to do so. To pledge to see his leader's vision through to its conclusion. It was what he knew Zhdanov wanted to hear, of course, but it was also his firm belief. He had been an orthodox Ultravisionary for many years, and he had no intention of deviating now, in the moments of greatest peril for the agenda as a whole.\n\nAnd though uncertain for the future, shaken and struggling as he still was, Chelomei knew he would fight to ensure that the promise he had made was properly kept."

As a man clearly believed to share Zhdanov's ideals and desires, he knew that the delegates were confident in his ability to continue the path shown to him by their departed icon. A small faction was clearly unhappy, but they mattered little, and would soon have no influence at all.\n\nAs Paramount Leader Chelomei stepped down from the platform, he kept his outside expression solemn. But, inside, he was smiling, knowing that his mentor had passed on with the surety that his vision would be continued."
