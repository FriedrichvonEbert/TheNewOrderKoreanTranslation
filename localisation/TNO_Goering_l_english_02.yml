As the dust settles and former kinsmen are hung for treason to the Führer, notable shipments expected from Slovakia have not turned up on time, or at all. When confronted, the Slovak government has stated their wish to be an independent, but allied, member of the Pakt. We are faced with a unique situation, and the results will set precedent..."

 GGR_a_reminder_of_obligations_desc:0 "When informed of Slovakia's declaration of independence, Führer Göring assumed it to be a joke. After the messenger was shot for insolence, the next man in line confirmed the news. Due to Slovakia's continued loyalty, the Führer has opted not to carpet bomb the state into submission. Instead, a quiet yet firm reminder will be sent in the form of a total embargo, with all forms of aid cancelled and Slovakian assets being frozen. As a Reichsprotektorat, it is Slovakia's sole purpose to serve the Reich. A 'gentle' reminder is all that is necessary."

In the anarchy that has followed, we are ready to destroy the bastards that corrupted our Reichsprotektorat.\n\nAll commands have been alerted, and the Wehrmacht is poised to strike down the traitors.

The mere thought of a banker and a liberal ruling such a vital part of the Greater Reich... who knows what that Speerite has planned for it? As a representative of liberalism, secessionism and democracy, Meyer-Landrut stands for everything that is anathema to National Socialism - the army recognises this, and is chomping at the bit to have at him. The Führer would have it no other way."

 GGR_the_last_of_the_liberals_desc:0 "In the final days of the war, as our triumph loomed, Speer's worms slithered their way along the forgotten roads and railways of the shattered Reich, seeking safety from the light of National Socialism. Were it not for Meyer-Landrut, they might have been caught and killed before ever finding that safety. Now, however, the Abwehr informs us that many Speerite civilians and soldiers alike are still alive and kicking in Ostland, turning to a banker of all things to save them in the absence of their false Führer. While they were no doubt welcomed at the time of their arrival, the traitorous government of Ostland will soon have reason to rue their decision, as every Speerite that fled to their lands is one more traitor to rally Germany against. This is no renewed conflict, but merely the final battle of the civil war!"

 GGR_the_worst_of_the_bankers_desc:0 "Bankers! Is there any profession so infested with profligates, rootless foreigners and, of course, Jews? I'd wager Meyer-Landrut has some Semite blood himself! Just the sort of thing needed to get people on-side, even if the genealogical records don't support it. We can worry about that later. The fact of the matter is that National Socialism found its first converts amongst the masses thanks to the blunders and scheming of the Judeo-Bolshevik bankers and capitalists. Operating from the shadows, they stabbed the Old Reich in the back, destroyed the Weimar Republic's economy and tried to bring down the entire world through the Wall Street Crash. The common man of Germany has no love for bankers and industrialists; the propaganda effectively writes itself. Never will we have so agreeable a target as Andreas Meyer-Landrut."
 GGR_the_myth_of_the_free:0 "자유의 미신"
 GGR_the_myth_of_the_free_desc:0 "Those who would look to Ostland for some hope of 'reform' and 'progress' are deluded at best. Really, does Ostland look like a 'free society' to anyone? Ethnic strife, poverty, ruined infrastructure and industry, food shortages - is this what freedom looks like? It is a myth, fellow Germans. A myth perpetuated by the corrupt plutocracy that is the United States. Where did their version of freedom lead them? To weakness, to instability... and, ultimately, to defeat. Without the amassed capital of the United States, plundered from the masses, how does Meyer-Landrut propose to make his promises reality? His 'freedom' is a falsehood. It belongs where all impure, deceptive myths do: in the dustbin of history."
 GGR_build_the_border:0 "국경선 건설"
 GGR_build_the_border_desc:0 "Despite the reliability of the Abwehr, we can never be too sure of the exact strength of our enemy in this instance. Cabals of bankers controlled much of the world before National Socialism ever came to be - despite their weakness, they are masters of subterfuge. Who knows how many fifth columnists wait among the crowds of refugees, just waiting for a chance to slip across the border? Perhaps the financier even intends for Ostland to serve as a staging ground for some greater hostile power... doubtless he is in talks with his hook-nosed comrades in America even as we speak! Whatever the potential threats, it would be prudent to fortify the border. Not just increased patrols, either; we need checkpoints, observation posts, AA batteries, airstrips, even forts! Whatever guarantees the security of our people near the border from bloodthirsty traitors and partisans is worth every mark!"

 GGR_now_or_never_desc:0 "Every second that passes gives that snake, Meyer-Landrut, more time to prepare for our arrival and brings more good Aryans closer to seduction by the honeyed words of the international Jewry. To withhold from striking immediately would be nothing more than an act of weakness and a betrayal of the spontaneous, masculine nature of the Aryan warrior! If we are capable, why not attack? Our lands are occupied by a traitor, a banker and a probable Jew! True-hearted Germans cry out for liberation from their despicable masters! What good will further procrastination do us when our people are being corrupted and killed just over the border? Make haste, brave soldiers!"

Our men, many of them hardened and bitter veterans of the civil war, are eager to take the fight to the last holdout of liberalism in the Reich. The Kriegsmarine has the coastline mined and monitored. Further east, the harsh and brutal lands of Russia will offer no refuge to traitors. The feeble liberals, with their foolish and ephemeral ideals, will be destroyed by our factually indisputable invincibility and the cold, hard logic of superior firepower.

There are still guerrillas and holdouts - Germans no less - active in Ostland, striking at outposts, loyalist townships and patrols. What madness grips them that they would continue to fight for the interests of international bankers with their homes in ruins and their families dead or imprisoned? What have they to gain? Is this a final, bitter curse from a defeated foe, or part of some greater plan by our enemies across the Atlantic? No matter the cause, we must treat this threat as we would any other. That is, we shall stomp, stomp and stomp again. Hard and fast, without mercy, until the last of these insects is reduced to a smear on the Wehrmacht's jackboot."

Many are hardened soldiers who have continued their futile struggle against our rightful rule ever since Ostland's liberation in 1941. SS 'werewolves', too, are a persistent thorn in our side. Even abandoned by their master, they are just as willing to fight to the death as the partisans and know our inner workings far better than the Balts do. Finally, there are those few Bormannites who resist the necessity of change and the renewal of the German warrior spirit. No matter their cause, they will all die in the end. They are little more than gnats biting at the heels of a lion - an annoyance at worst and one we can deal with in short order."

There, many recognise the necessity of always being alert and active with weapons close at hand, watching for any emergent threat. This wise outlook on life has already netted us a warm welcome in German-majority areas and there are many who prepared for our arrival with acts of sabotage and propaganda behind the lines of the liberal forces. These are good, loyal men - loyal to Germany, loyal to National Socialism and, most important of all, loyal to Göring. With the previous bureaucracy and garrison members largely dead or in hiding, we will need these men in the days to come."

Baltic Germans were often the first target of partisans, both before and during the civil war. Most colonists have lost someone, or know someone else who has, breeding resentment, outrage and hate - all useful assets to help reassert our control. It is not uncommon for a recruiting officer to arrive in a German town and immediately be swamped with men young and old alike clamoring for the chance to avenge the fallen. Even before our arrival, they banded together in militias and roving bands to keep their Aryan kin safe and secure from the tide of rats as it rose ever higher, threatening to engulf all they held dear. The Ostland Divisions might not turn out to be the most capable or well-equipped of our divisions, but they will certainly be fiercely loyal to their race, with high morale and a deep devotion to National Socialist principles. Their symbolic importance, as defenders of Germany who never gave up the fight regardless of the odds, will make them an example for all good German colonists to aspire to!"

With mechanised patrols on the streets of Riga and reconnaissance planes active 24 hours a day, we can safely say that Ostland is 100% rebellion-free and ready for integration. The day has been a long time coming, but with the population being majority German and our control so thoroughly established in all facets of society and the economy, we can finally bring an end to Ostland's status as a mere Reichskommissariat and welcome it into the Greater German Reich as a full-fledged province! Colonisation and Germanisation efforts will continue, of course, but that's all just busywork at this point. The Baltic populace is no longer a concern and their racially acceptable elements will be as German as the Führer himself in no time! The Reich proper expands! Welcome home, Ostland!"

 GGR_reigning_in_drechsler_desc:0"On the surface, the triumph in Ostland of a hardcore militarist like Otto-Heinrich Dreschsler would appear to be an objectively good thing for our interests. However, there is a catch: Drechsler is famously a part of Field Marshal Schörner's clique and is virtually guaranteed to act at his patron's beck and call, rather than following the Führer's directives. Knowing this, the Führer wishes to have Dreschler removed from office by any means necessary (including force), but any direct action against him would undoubtedly rouse the ire of Schörner, a key backer of our cause. Ultimately, despite his well-backed threats, the Field Marshal is unlikely to move against the Führer so early, but he will not forget such an insult..."

Drechsler's troops, at least, have done a fine job of securing the key roads, railways, ports and airfields in Ostland. Bringing the Führer's own divisions into Ostland and dispersing them to reinforce the entire country is of utmost importance; we cannot allow the garrison free reign over crucial infrastructure in the event of further conflict. Not because they aren't trustworthy, of course; it's just an important job, and the Führer wants Germany's best troops to handle it. Surely Drechsler can see the wisdom in that?"

He is admirable, brave and a true National Socialist, dedicated wholly to the ideals and values of the Aryan race. He is a loyal and true soldier, unwavering in his devotion to the Reich, its people, and, surely, the Führer. What more could Göring ask for? Perhaps Drechsler even deserves a reward or several for his efforts... large ones, on a regular basis.

The Wehrmacht is insistent that none of the officials in Ostland are above suspicion and demands the right to subject them to military justice.

By using our fleet to cut off major ports and blockade the coastline, we will shatter the Norwegian economy, causing economic collapse and driving the Norwegians to poverty and starvation. If the plan succeeds, the Norwegians will be too weak to lift a finger against our forces when we land.\n\nUnfortunately, this plan does have some flaws. The Kriegsmarine is underfunded and still somewhat damaged from the chaos of the civil war, and currently is not in the best shape to conduct any large scale operations such as a blockade of the long Norwegian coastline. In addition, the fortifications we built with German sweat to hold off any western invasions, complete with naval guns, are undoubtedly now in the hands of the traitorous Norwegians, and may be used against our fleet.\n\nBoth of these problems are easily fixable, of course.

By using this fascinating new technology, we can swarm the resisting Norwegians with a cloud of steel and lead, overwhelming their defenses and seizing ports before they can mount a defense.\n\nOf course, helicopters have their drawbacks.

To combat this, we shall use an invention that the strategists of 1940 could only dream of- missiles. By building up bases in Denmark, we will be able to fire missiles of all kinds into the mountains of Norway, obliterating any bunkers and forts in a hail of rockets and bombs, without a single German man being forced to lay his life on the line.\n\nIn addition to the immediate strategic benefit of these bases, they will also be a fine addition to our defenses against any American incursion into Europe, covering the entrance into the Baltic and much of the North Sea. Indeed, some have even gotten to asking why these positions have not been built before now.

Of course, these two points are now being hammered furiously by a seething Schörner and his acolytes.

Of course, such a success requires parades and celebrations all across Germany, of which both have been celebrated.

There is a widely whispered explanation of his paranoia that he just wants to get rid of those whose loyalty toward him are suspected. Though such a story sounds hard to confirm, the Führer himself still appreciate Schörner's genius in the story regardless of their personal relationship.\n\nAnd now, during the invasion of Iberia, reports about the fortifications in the hills caught the Führer's attention. Those forts are surely hard to attack and occupy, so why don't we make Schörner's loyalists deal with them? No matter what their plan is, our orders will be simple and clear: keep charging until those forts are occupied or destroyed. And the greatest part of this plan is, Schörner will have no reasons to reject our orders. Thinking of that point, a little smile creeps across the Führer's mouth."

And only thanks to the Reich's quick move, order has been restored on the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAs a result of such a history, the Reich has made the decision that the Iberian Union will be restored by us.

If you find each other hard to get along with, then fine, you don't need to see or hear them now, for the Reich will cut all connections between you and your former partner.

Therefore, the Wehrmacht and the German people respect the Basques for their unyielding spirits, and are willing to help them achieve their dreams.\n\nWhile an independent Basque nation may be too unrealistic now, we can liberate them from the Spanish and grant them some kind of autonomy, in exchange of their help in our local policing and war efforts.

Their industries and resources will be nationalized by Germany, and every move they take will be closely watched.

We will never keep a close eye due to the long distance, but on the contrary, even more efforts will be taken to make our control of the peninsula can be controlled as solid as other parts in Europe.

Such courage, resolve and unyielding will is just the proof of their noble origins, and are always respected by the German people.\n\nHowever, even the most noble child could still fall into a wrong and dark path without rightful guidance. Trapped in the Iberian quagmire, the Basque people have forgotten their blood and degenerate into barbarism and ignorance.

Catalonia is at the borders of our sphere, and it will be a breaking point of our military campaigns in the Peninsula.

Action must be taken immediately if we wish to have a stable Iberia at our back.\n\nThat action, as our trusted generals have seen, is not difficulty to find. In the past, the Iberian Union had the Axencia Anti-Separatista to fight against the terrorists, and we will create a similar department called "Agentur zur Seperatistenbekämpfung", or ASB in short.

They may not be the best friends we can make, and it is understandable such some may think the places we choose to make friends are too weird, but no one can deny that they will be useful friends to us.

And now, the chance has been offered to the Wehrmacht.\n\nUnder the governance of Iberian Union, a lot of Portuguese who faced oppressed by the Union have expressed their willingness to help our war cause. We could use them to subvert the local government of Iberian Union, and by doing this, we shall be able to weaken the resistance we're going to face when the war breaks out.

From lush forest to steep mountains, from frozen land to muddy swaps, every kind of terrain made by the earth has been conquered by us, and the Iberian Union won't become a insuperable barrier to our forces.\n\nTo easily root out the resistance, our special troops will receive specific trainings designed for the landform of Iberian Peninsula. And with the incomparable military power, the Reich will provide our courageous soldiers the highest standard of training in this world.

And since they're definitely not racial brothers of the Reich, there is no reason that they could enjoy any privilege that other Iberian people shouldn't have. Any promises we made before will be defined as fabricated and invalid, and they will be treated like all other dissenters and the Iberian scums. All must understand that no one can bargain with the German Reich, and total submission is only way he can take.\n\nAnd after dealing with those bastards, all memories of our promises will disappear with them.

We, with our advanced experience of purging those insects in other places, cannot repeat their foolishness.\n\nFrom this day on, all Iberians must be totally loyal towards the German Reich. Every move they make, every word they speak and every mood they expressed will be closely watched by our agents, and any sign of disobedience will lead to imprisonment or even execution. They can have no doubts, no hesitations and even no free thoughts, for all they need to know is to follow our orders.

Consequently, the strength of those organizations kept growing and caused more and more troubles every day. Eventually, the prosperity and stability of Iberian Union was doomed in constant violence and riots.\n\nBut now, we could tell those terrorists that, their good old days are gone.

Divide, conquer and rule over, such a strategy is as old as time itself, and we shall implement it here.\n\nIn addition, to avoid the possible risk of communication and cooperation between different ethnic groups in Iberia, we need to divide those people with enough caution. Population for each RK must be carefully designed so that each RK may be able to handle their own realm on their own without needs to worry about a total uprising.

Yet it would be foolish to ignore the threat of other powers in the world that still seek any opportunity to weaken our fatherland, especially the OFN and its American master. Each German victory in Europe is a warning of them, and scared of the mighty military power we hold, their subversive activities is getting more and more frequent. And thus, our soldiers must stay vigilant enough at any time.\n\nFor the US, Iberian Peninsula is westernmost part of Europe and therefore has great strategic values. Our agents reported that secret ships and OFN spies have been sent from their ports to Iberia. Due its distance between Germania and Iberia, we may not be able to deal with the sudden case there and as the result, we can only rely on the sense of responsibility of our local occupied forces.

And now, as the whole Iberian Peninsula has been firmly controlled by the Reich, we are able to cut the throat of the Italians and destroy their ability to sustain themselves.\n\nToday, according to the direct order from Germania, the Gibraltar Dam will be closed until all Mediterranean nations bow before the German Reich. When we started constructing the dam, many have doubted and even mocked at the utility of such a grand project, especially when the program was suspended due to financial reasons. But now, the dam will become a true nightmare for all Italians when they realize how terrible their shortages can be. After closing the Gibraltar dam, all our plans about Iberian Peninsula will be finished perfectly, as the economy of Italians will soon be strangled to its last breath. Now let's cheer at the beauty of sunset in the entrance of such a peaceful and vast sea. Sieg Heil and cheer for the Fatherland once again!"

The first is to send in more fresh troops from the Vaterland to storm the mountain fortresses, a costly but effective solution. The second is to establish Russian penal battalions and force them to attack the fortifications or face execution: while much cheaper in both money and German lives wasted, this solution is also riskier as there is a higher chance of desertion or even revolt..."

Even though we managed to repel the offensive, the border was redrawn nearer to Moskowien.\n\nWith our offensive triumphant, we can now reverse this shame! The A-A Line shall be rebuilt, a stalwart sentinel forever guarding Germania from her enemies!

The Empire of the Rising Sun has fallen far since their last great victories, which gives us the opportunity to strike deep into their economic heartland; continental Asia.\n\nOur greatest challenge is establishing a land border with Japan's Sphere. We have two equally ambitious routes.\n\nThe first proposed plan is to kick down the rotten door to our east one last time and finally conquer the Rus. The terrain Siberia is inhospitable and we would need to build supporting infrastructure, but is the most direct route to Japan's holdings.\n\nAlternatively, we could surprise the world and make our approach south, through Iran and India. Though the going will be tough, to say the least, it would be completely unpredictable.

GGR_review_the_fleet:0 "Review the Fleet"
GGR_review_the_fleet_desc:0 "Once upon a time, before Hitler had even joined the National Socialist movement, the Kaiserliche Marine was the pride of Germany, and the envy of the world. Indeed, it was so powerful that the weak, pitiful west forced us to dismantle it after the shame of the Great War, for fear of us returning to greatness. Of course, this did not stop us from rebuilding our fleet in the glory days of the Reich, restoring the Kriegsmarine to heights unseen by even the Empire. By the end of the Second World War, the German fleet was among the strongest on earth, with the masses of U-Boat wolfpacks becoming the bane of our enemies and the surface fleet, backed by the power of our battleships, spreading fear across those who opposed us. For a time, it seemed, the old imperial dream of naval dominance could be achieved.\n\nHowever, as of late, the Kriegsmarine has been, if not treading water, sliding backwards in its ability. The ships and submarines rust in their harbors, underfunded and undercrewed. The Kriegsmarine in general has become the black sheep of the Heer, constantly overlooked in favor of the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht's needs. Nowadays, the Kriegsmarine is in a state of disrepair, slowly decaying. This cannot stand, especially with some of the Führer's more grandiose plans requiring a strong navy to succeed.\n\nTwo schools of thought have emerged in the Admiralty, each butting against each other in a constant battle. The first school emphasizes the need for battleships in the modern age, arguing that with simple renovations and fixes, the sheer power a battleship brings would dominate both the American and Japanese fleets. The second school pushes heavily to scrap our old battleships, instead pivoting into the new world of carrier-based doctrine.\n\nThe decision falls to Göring now, who must decide- shall the old, tried and tested battleship prevail, or will it fall to the modern competition of the aircraft carrier?"

While this choice is certainly a controversial one among the old guard of the Kriegsmarine, it is certainly a necessary one- what use is a battleship if it can't even see its target?\n\nThe restructuring of the Kriegsmarine is set to begin immediately, starting with the renovation of the battleships. The process to gut the old kings of the sea, painful as it is, must be begun now. That way, with both the weight of maintenance and the profits of the scrap, we can begin production on our new line of carriers, and make a tidy profit in the end. Though this process will strike deep at the heart of any true German patriot, it must be begun now, or else we will find ourselves unready and unable to fight when the time comes."

While this plan does not try to save the battleships in their current forms, what it proposes is almost as shocking and daring as the original change.\n\nThe plan, obviously refined and rewritten multiple times, details the potential opportunity we currently have to refit our battleships into carriers, instead of scrapping the old hulks and building new ships. While the process of converting our battleships into carriers is certainly a costly one, the plan emphasizes both the practical and overall benefits of such a change. Practically, the plan will allow us to keep some of the old hulls around as bases to new carriers, instead of being forced to fully scrap each of our relics. Overall, these retrofits would give us the necessary experience needed to build full carriers.\n\nWhile scrapping the battleships is certainly the more economical choice, the possibility of repurposing our old prides of the fleet into a modern day wonder of Germany has captivated the Führer. With the flick of his pen and a word to his advisors, the plan has changed, and those battleships that once seemed to be reaching the end of the line have been granted a new lease on life."

In such a situation, it seems the risk is just too great.\n\nTherefore, as painful as it is, we will have to dismantle and scrap some of the Kriegsmarine's greatest ships. Though we have tried to save and restore them, it seems that the years of neglect and disrepair have taken their toll. Even now, scrapping ships take the first sections of these kings of the sea apart, tearing old traditions away piece by piece.\n\nEvery cloud has a silver lining, however, and the silver lining in this particular cloud is quite comforting.

Whatever one's opinion is on the plan in the Kriegsmarine, the only important opinion on the matter is the Führer's, and he is firmly in favor.\n\nAs Göring bluntly states, the only way to defeat such superpowers as America and Japan is to defeat their navies on the open seas, and a modern Plan Z would give the Kriegsmarine the ability to do just that. As Hitler worked so tirelessly to defeat the Royal Navy, so shall we work tirelessly to defeat the Americans and Japanese.

Instead, our fleet shall renovate our battleships into the modern age, adding the improvements of the modern age to our behemoths.

The Führer leant over the canvas, his prodigious bulk blocking out the overhead light like an eclipse over the western hemisphere. His finger gestured between two of the largest blocks on the map before he leaned back again with a wobble, satisfied, and took yet another sip from his glass.\n\n"This is where we will find our allies."\n\nThe figure to his right stared down the bridge of his nose through his reading glasses doing his best to ignore the winestain that formed a new landmass in the Atlantic. "Haiti and Cuba?". Schörner's lip curled upwards into a sneer. "Forgive me, mein Führer, but while they would provide excellent staging posts for further operations their cooperation is unnecessary - and I expect not forthcoming. To notify them of our intentions would be counterproductive in excess."\n\n"Have a little faith, Ferdinand. I am told the Haitian regime has taken great inspiration from National Socialism - no doubt they will be overjoyed for assistance against America and Dominica."\n\nSchörner resisted the urge to remind Göring that Dominica was a completely different place to the Dominican Republic - with the amount of wine the Führer has consumed it was unlikely he would understand. "And Castro? The man is an ardent Communist. If he chose to work with us he would either be a fool or a backstabber."\n\nGöring seemed to be deliberately ignoring him, and had already begun writing a letter with a wobbling hand. "You have no head for diplomacy, Ferdinand. Certainly we could invade all of the Caribbean, but a little goodwill goes a long way."\n\nSchörner simmered on the inside. On some days, he was sure the Führer only played these little games to spite him and the other militarists, a way of feeling in control once again, but on other days the almost insanity of the man seemed genuine. So be it he thought, let the Führer dream of being a diplomat. He would begin drawing up the backup plans."

Only the Reich can offer protection in these circumstances, for it is the might of the Reich that will eventually prevail.

In came a group of four men who looked far more suited in overalls and straw hats than the suits they were wearing. As soon as they laid eyes on Goering, they made the faces of children in a candy shop or of men facing their reckoning with God. Hell, they were probably resisting the temptation to kneel on the floor and grovel. Their leader, Robert Williams, said nervously, "Mein Führer, it is the greatest honour of our lives to meet you."\n Goering nonchalantly flicked the cigarette ashes on his desk. He was not paying these strange men much attention. "Oh? Oh, yes, of course. It's my pleasure." The two military men beside Goering give him a look that was more exasperated than angry, as they were used to and perfectly happy with their supposed leader's apathy and numbness by this point.\nRemer got straight to business. "Gentlemen, you have certain paramilitary organizations who might be willing to support our cause against your degenerate government, correct?"\n "Yessir!" Replied the second-in-command Gordon Mohr. "The Christian Patriots Defense League is at your disposal."\n "Sure... Excellent. Let us discuss some plans we have for the assassination of the US president," said Remer, who was effectively controlling the meeting by now. These were some of the most eccentric men any of the three Germans had ever seen, but there was no harm in getting them to do some dirty work for the Reich if they were so eager to help.\n At the end of the meeting, Mohr humbly asked, "Mein Führer, if I may make one small request of you. I have a letter from one of our fellow sympathizers, Father Charles Coughlin that he has asked I give to you to read. It would be another wonderful honour."\n "Of course," replied a distant Goering, almost forgetting to reach out and take the letter. "I will gladly read it.""

A few of them did manage to get inside and shoot some random congressmen, guards, and bureaucrats, but the president was safely evacuated from Washington D.C. the moment the attack began.\nThere is no easy end to this war like we had hoped, but we at least managed to wreak some havoc upon the American government."

After a tortuously long week that had been dominated solely by political matters related to the newest of the Reich's occupational regimes, Göring had managed to get one blessed night to himself. How to spend it had never been in question; the Staatsoper Germania had premiered a new run of Weber's Der Freischutz, and the Führer was determined to attend the show come Hell or high water. Why, even if Schörner were to barge in and announce that they had entered into war with America or Japan, Göring would not be dissuaded. He needed this as a man in a desert needs water.\n\nBundled up in multiple layers for disguise and accompanied only by the most discrete and trusted of his personal guard, the man who ruled over all of Europe and much of Asia and Africa did not look the part. He was careful to avoid the gazes of any of the other opera goers, as even with all of his efforts to disguise he was still the most known man in the Reich, if not the world. After a few stressful encounters necessary to procure his seat, Göring was finally able to take a place in the most prestigious of the viewing boxes. Now all that was left was to relax, and immerse himself in the show.\n\nThat was his plan at any rate, but it was not destined to be. The performance, as expected of the renowned theater, was as terrific as Göring could ever remember it being; its quality was not what haunted his mind as the lines of "O diese Sonne" ran through his head. No, it was the dawning realization on the part of the Führer that he, for all his power and prestige, was in no better a situation than young Max. Those damned militarists, Schörner, Remer, and the rest, they were the demonic Zamiel who had given him the magic bullets that had granted him such success. When, the thought flashed into his mind, would it come time for the seventh bullet to be fired? And what would be its terrible price? He shuddered silently as unbidden images of hellfire and death presented themselves to him in an inescapable montage of doom. The magic of the night was gone, and the Führer collapsed into a deep sense of fear as he heard the chorus utter the line that had always been able to move him before, only now in quite a different sense."

GGR_intimidate_the_italians_desc:0 "As the hour of Italy's conquest approaches, we must be sure to engage them on multiple fronts, the better to stretch their armies thin. The Italian Middle East is a turbulent region, filled with groups vying for various degrees of independence or autonomy from their Mediterranean masters. It is also, of course, filled to bursting with oil, vital for the continuation of our glorious conquests. Now that we have a border with Italy's possessions, we should move a number of divisions into the area to conduct open exercises, aggressive aerial patrols and general displays of force. When the time comes to move on the Levant, the Italians will be so terrified and demoralized that their resistance will crumble like the ruins they inhabit!"

GGR_our_foothold_in_asia_desc:0 "With the land secured and the most rebellious occupants dealt with, we can formally welcome Reichskommissariat Kleinasien to the Greater German Reich! This land of coastlines and mountains will be the springboard for projecting German power into the entirety of West Asia, thanks to our infrastructural improvements and the vast amount of natural resources it provides. The barbarians who infest Kleinasien continue to be a minor problem, but their time will come soon enough. We now possess one of the most defensible geopolitical regions in the world, and the Turkish threat to the Balkans has been ended forevermore. Regardless of what the future might hold for the Reich, we have achieved a great victory for civilization."

 GGR_the_hawk_and_the_hunter_desc:0 "The Führer knew this day would come. Schörner was always a perfidious snake, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and claim power for himself. Now, with the Reich stronger than ever and the Wehrmacht pushed to its very limits, he plots against his commander-in-chief and thereby the entirety of the German people. Should he succeed in overthrowing our government, the Reich will surely be plunged into an abyss from which it will never escape - a deathtrap of deranged militarism and senseless violence.\n\nGöring must rise to the challenge one last time. For the Reich and its glorious conquests to be secured in perpetuity, the Monster in Uniform must be destroyed along with each and every deviant traitor who would follow him."
 GGR_donitz_shadow_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine, even after being brought to heel, was never a friend to Göring. Grand Admiral Dönitz's shadow still hangs over our great fleet, tainting it with Bormannite conservatism. While the Führer now finds himself facing his own erstwhile militarist allies, there are still far too many questions about the political nature of the Kriegsmarine's leadership. It is unlikely that Schörner has brought any of them into his camp, but if their loyalty is not secured they might choose to remain neutral in the power struggle, just as they did during the Bürgerkrieg. Still, if the Führer can demonstrate the validity of his new, dynamic form of National Socialist conservatism, they might be reined in and their mighty guns directed to his benefit."
 GGR_can_we_trust_the_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The Führer must have his navy on-side to maintain German power projection and overseas capabilities, no matter what comes. Quiet negotiations shall begin; the Abwehr will be dispatched to probe the officer corps for any Schörnerite presence or plans of disloyal neutrality. Their loyalty is easily worth whatever paltry concessions they might demand of the Führer in exchange for deeper political cooperation. Once their political position is ascertained, our strategy for handling them can be adjusted accordingly. They certainly can't be any harder to manage than the militarists ever were."
 GGR_find_the_trustworthy_desc:0 "The struggle between the Führer and his treasonous field marshal is not yet common knowledge outside the shadowed halls of the Reich Chancellery. The average German on the street knows nothing of the coming storm, and the Kriegsmarine, always at sea, knows even less. Of course, this is precisely how the Führer would have it; the fewer individuals are compromised with knowledge of the divide in the Reich's leadership, the better. Care must be taken in our present dealings with the Kriegsmarine so that they learn nothing more than they must. Only those few reliable admirals with a vested interest in Göring's success should be brought on board."
 GGR_we_know_who_we_can_trust_desc:0 "Namely, not the Kriegsmarine. During the Bürgerkrieg, they fled to Crimea, showing that the only colors they flew were their own. They might have professed loyalty to the Reich above all else, but how could we ever believe that excuse when Göring was clearly the only legitimate Führer in the first place? The Kriegsmarine has been insubordinate for years, dithering at every order and not even bothering to maintain the correct political standards for its leadership. The only appropriate solution is to cut out this cancer infecting the Reich - purge the ranks, from the admiralty down to the lowliest e-boat crew! They will be of little use against Schörner anyway, so who will miss those sea-rats?"
 GGR_an_airforce_with_a_navy_desc:0 "Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine will always be secondary to the Heer and the illustrious Luftwaffe. With the old guard and unreliable crews purged, we should begin the long-overdue process of reforming our naval command to correctly represent its position. We have had quite enough of salt-worn old men and disloyal, drunk sailors. Naturally, the most logical choice here is to put men who have experience in combat, organization and administration in charge, but there is currently a dearth of skilled seamen for some reason. Thankfully, the Führer knows plenty of talented and politically reliable men in the Luftwaffe who are due for promotions! These men will form a new board to replace the admiralty and ensure the swift reorganization and - more importantly - loyalty of our reborn Kriegsmarine."
 GGR_revive_the_freikorps_desc:0 "The Freikorps - nearly five decades have passed since their glory days, but the saviors of the Reich live on in the German cultural consciousness. Their victories over communism and the Jewry were forever immortalized by Hitler, and their deeds remain the bedrock of our National Socialist traditions. Freikorps membership, or descent from a Freikorps veteran, remains a marker of prestige in our society. None would question us, therefore, if we were to announce the reformation and formalization of this old paramilitary. To ordinary citizens, it would appear perfectly innocuous - a means by which to prepare as many people as possible for war and allow old soldiers to maintain their martial pride. To the Führer, however, it will be the largest and most well-trained militia force in history: a personal paramilitary at his beck and call. Our enemies will quake at our numbers, should further strife come!"
 GGR_arms_under_the_table_desc:0 "Strictly speaking, the Reich has a vested interest in keeping the capacity for violence among the populace at a low level. These are dire times, however, and the new Freikorps cannot afford to be bound by the same laws and regulations as civil organizations. Anything not being directed to the Wehrmacht should be funnelled to the militia; guns, grenades, trucks, even light vehicles and helicopters if possible! They must be a true fighting force, able to hold their own against anything the enemy might throw at them. Every militia fighter must be the equal of a hardened grenadier!"
 GGR_the_unsullied_service_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe, Göring's pride and joy, has always been loyal to him and always will be. He is their glorious father and their favorite son, marshal and veteran both. Schörner could never taint this branch of the military, the pinnacle of Aryan martial might! Organizing them for a possible conflict with the militarists will therefore be a simple matter - Göring speaks, and they obey. Air wings shall be recalled, Air Landing divisions put on standby and Fallschirmjäger roused from barracks. While loyalists in the other branches will undoubtedly have a role to play, it is the knights of the sky who will bring us final victory."
 GGR_protect_the_bases_desc:0 "Knowing that he could never sway them, it is likely that Schörner will instead try to sabotage the Luftwaffe by any means possible. Naturally for such a brutish man, his first choice will be to attack vulnerable bases and hangars, probably with commando units or bribed turncoats. Security at all key Luftwaffe facilities must be increased dramatically. It couldn't hurt to have better-armed units up to and including Panzer companies guarding them. Furthermore, security checks must be tightened up and base personnel monitored closely. Even a single broken link in the chain could have severe consequences for our beloved aviators."
 GGR_mark_targets_in_advance_desc:0 "Schörner has not yet begun to move against us openly, so there is no risk in scouting 'his' territory. It will be obvious to his clique what our reconnaissance aircraft are up to over their Reichskommissariats, but they wouldn't dare turn them back. While we do not expect Schörner to possess a significant air force of his own, the Abwehr has confirmed that he has been devising an answer to the Luftwaffe. His allies also possess large numbers of older aircraft, ostensibly to maintain control over their airspace. It is imperative that we find this mockery of the Luftwaffe wherever it hides and wipe it out the moment Schörner makes his bid for power."
 GGR_move_against_schorner_desc:0 "All possible preparations have been made and enough loyalties have been secured. With the more practical concerns taken care of, we have some administrative reorganization to do. Schörner's clique is deeply entrenched in OKW and in several important Reichskommissariats, which simply cannot continue. We must clear his toadies out of their positions and replace them with more loyal and controllable men of the Führer's own choosing. Schörner will push back against this as soon as he hears of it, but if we move quickly enough we should be able to completely displace his clique before he is prepared for open conflict."
 GGR_replace_the_field_marshal_desc:0 "Schörner once served ably, but no longer. Having lived through both World Wars, the West Russian War and all of the Reich's subsequent conquests, he is getting old and tired. Surely, the old warrior deserves peaceful semi-retirement in a quiet, less stressful role. Reichskommissariat Kamtschatka, perhaps? The Führer is certain that his old friend will be most grateful to have fewer commitments - and to be very, very, very far away from Germania. It's such a stressful place to live, after all."
 GGR_the_afrikajager_desc:0 "Siegfried Müller is incompetent, corrupt, treasonous and possibly the most pathetic excuse for a Reichskommissar in the entire Reich. His oversight of Zentralafrika turned out to be a complete sham and it is only by the Führer's mercy that he yet lives. However, his apparently undesirable traits also make him pliable and easy to control. He can be appeased with material wealth, has no grand ambitions, and his incompetence can be compensated for by delegating his duties. Müller is likely to be the worst Field Marshal the Reich will ever have, but he will certainly be the most useful."
 GGR_the_berliner_ratte_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is no friend of Göring, but he is easily the most competent candidate for the position of Field Marshal. With a long record of service and a reputation for honest patriotism, Speidel is immensely popular amongst both the populace and the Heer. Merely promoting him to the position of Field Marshal would be seen as a supremely wise and generous act, and could bring many militarists to heel. However, he might prove to be more trouble than he's worth; Speidel is a vocal critic of militarism and the Abwehr reports that he has always privately opposed the further expansion of German territory. He may not even be any more loyal than Schörner, in the end. That said, perhaps his principles will win out over his political opposition to Göring, and he will restrain himself appropriately."
 GGR_nepotism_desc:0 "Frankly, Göring has had enough of self-proclaimed 'suitable candidates'. All these ambitious, self-serving men squabbling to take Schörner's place - what good are they, really? How can any of them ever be trusted to abide by the Führer's directives? Any one of them could be another Schörner in waiting, another traitor seeking to stake his claim on the Führership! No, we need a good man, someone we can trust, someone who will neither challenge the Führer's right to rule or attempt to rock the boat.\n\nSomeone like... Theodore Göring, beloved nephew of the Führer! Under-qualified? Perhaps, but also reliable. Besides, who's to say he won't learn on the job?"
 GGR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "At last! We had our doubts - our fears, even - that Schörner would not go quietly, that he would go to any lengths to dominate the Reich. The eruption of a second Bürgerkrieg seemed inevitable as the Field Marshal gathered his forces and rallied countless traitors to his banner. Those few enemies of the Reich who remain no doubt waited with bated breath to see our mighty empire fall to infighting once more.\n\nAnd yet, their dreams will never be realised. The treasonous Field Marshal has been unseated from his office and stripped of any capacity to wage war upon us, all without firing a shot! Relegated to the furthest reaches of Siberia and with his allies bought, bullied or broken, the monster in uniform will never again threaten the Führer's rightful mandate. Heil Göring!"
 GGR_test_their_loyalty_desc:0 "Since assuming power, the Führer has seen many new generals commissioned. The cream of the Reich's officer corps, these young men are all seasoned veterans of our many conquests, having learned as much on the battlefield as in the academies. Their loyalties remain undecided, likely due to their preoccupation leaving little time for politicking. Now, however, with Schörner's clique working to shore up their strength, the young generals have become a target for militarist intrigue. The traitor will surely attempt to bring them into his camp by any means necessary. We have to sway them before he has the chance - by hook, or by crook!"
 GGR_incentivize_the_new_guard_desc:0 "Despite their claims to be proud, principled men in the Prussian tradition, many of our new generals are anything but. Part of it is simply the nature of power; money is ultimately merely another means by which to acquire it. In that regard, it is no less effective a currency than blood. Those younger generals who are not yet wholly loyal to either Schörner or the Führer could be easily swayed in the latter's favour by the sweet allure of higher salaries and pensions, or even 'gifts' straight from his own purse. Making someone's life a little easier rarely goes unappreciated, after all..."
 GGR_a_little_extra_desc:0 "Some of today's young generals are unfortunately a little harder to please, as with the rest of their generation. They aren't content unless they're enjoying fine dining every night, cavorting with half a dozen high-class ladies and zooming around in the latest Mercedes sports cars. Though the older officers shake their heads and rant about the days of austerity under Hitler, the Führer understands the wants and needs of this new and talented generation of leaders. If they require even greater rewards to be satisfied, so be it. Fast cars, country estates, wine from the Führer's own cellar - whatever it takes, they must be loyal to us!"
 GGR_an_abundance_of_medals_desc:0 "The downside to being a newly-minted general these days is the unfortunate shortage of medals one can wear. Back in the days of the Empire, every general worth his salt would be absolutely festooned with medals and his uniform decorated with gold filigree. Only a few trembling old men can still boast such a grand panoply, and the younger generation of officers feel that they are unfairly compared to the old Prussian officer corps. In his generosity, the Führer has proclaimed that he will restore this proud aesthetic tradition. Henceforth, all deserving generals will have however many pieces of gold, silver and silk to decorate their uniforms as they feel is necessary - all that is necessary is for them to swear eternal allegiance to the one true Führer, Hermann Göring. For one's glory to be so resplendent, is that so high a price?"
 GGR_we_know_where_you_live_desc:0 "Gold, jewelry and fine wine? Who do these upstart generals think they are, middle-aged bourgeoise housewives? The true German officer needs no incentive beyond patriotism! If he cannot find it within himself to devote the entirety of his being to the Reich, then perhaps he needs a little reminder of what is at stake! There will be no tolerance for preening, vainglorious children within the Wehrmacht's command structure; they will serve because the Führer demands it! All suspect officers will be closely monitored by the Gestapo, and any cowardice, corruption or disloyalty duly punished by the most severe means possible!"
 GGR_and_youre_families_desc:0 "Some young officers think themselves brave. With their egos bloated by their rank and rewards, they believe that they are above discipline and loyalty. Not even the harshest threats to their livelihoods are taken seriously, perhaps due to our historically lax attitude towards officer autonomy under the militarists. They will soon learn that Göring is not Schörner - he does not tolerate his subordinates living corrupt lives as petty kings of their divisions. If threatening their persons is insufficient, perhaps their families should become involved in present matters. After all, isn't family the core of Aryan values?"
 GGR_never_look_the_other_way_desc:0 "Though we have always tried to be merciful to the lesser races of the world, it is an unfortunate reality that many are as recalcitrant children who refuse to acknowledge their betters. Well, as the saying goes: "Spare the rod, spoil the child." We have been tolerant up to this point, but recently some of our subject peoples have been far too uncooperative - even violent. We cannot show weakness in this crucial time; we must discipline these ungrateful savages with bullet and bayonet! Some might balk at this task, but there are a number of officers in the Schörnerite tradition who will follow any order, no matter how harsh or - in the eyes of weak foreigners - inhumane."
 GGR_trials_for_warcrimes_desc:0 "Shocking! A number of our best officers, once thought loyal and true paragons of the Reich, have been directly implicated in horrific war crimes against non-Aryan populations! That something like this could have happened on Schörner's watch is unthinkable - how could any good, honest German ever succumb to such violence and depravity? State media will make this outrage known to the whole Reich, and the guilty parties arrested and brought to trial immediately! National Socialism does not permit acts of senseless brutality and genocide, and nor will the Führer!"
 GGR_reward_faithful_service_desc:0 "Many of the Führer's closest followers have been with him for decades. These officers have proven their loyalty time and time again, supporting him in the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg and beyond. The bravest and truest of Germany's soldiers, their time to be justly rewarded has finally come. Medals and financial benefits are not enough - these men simply must have their own Reichskommissariats! Is there any more comfortable and well-deserved retirement than to manage one of our prosperous and hard-won colonies?"
 GGR_governor_generals_desc:0 "There was a lot of debate within the Führer's cabinet about where to send our new Reichskommissars. After all, we have already allocated all of our conquests to RKs, or annexed them into the Reich. Then, a stroke of genius struck the Führer: Central Asia! It remains one of the most ill-managed and rebellious areas in the greater Reich, probably due to the overstretched and weary administration. The logical solution to the problem is, naturally, to divide the region into four new Reichskommissariats, thereby killing two birds with one stone; the administrative issues will be solved, and our generals will have their promised fiefdoms far, far away from Germania."
 GGR_wandering_minds_desc:0 "The Führer has been notified of an unfortunate occurrence in our logistics department: the new Reichskommissars report that their troops are severely under-equipped! This is truly a tragedy, but how could it have happened? All the paperwork on Germania's end show that the required equipment was shipped out on schedule. Perhaps there was some error, or the trains delivered their cargo to the wrong place? Well, never mind. This will soon be resolved - the Führer himself has pledged to oversee all future deliveries of equipment to Central Asia personally! Our men can rest easy knowing that he's on the job!"

 GGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Treason without compare has struck the Reich once more - we are again engulfed in civil war! The traitor Hans Speidel has risen up in rebellion, and the former Field Marshal, Ferdinand Schörner, has established himself as a rival claimant to the Führership! We have come so far, conquered so much in the name of National Socialism and the Aryan race; we cannot afford to fail now!\n\nOur great Führer has led us through trials to eclipse even the World Wars! He has defeated fleets of thousands - crushed rock and metal and bone beneath the grinding treads of the Wehrmacht! His reign will not end this way, not at their hands! The world he has built will endure for a thousand years! Sieg heil!"
 GGR_the_key_to_victory_desc:0 "Schörner might have his conscript hordes, but we are the sole bearers of the Germanic martial tradition. No violent thug pressed into service and armed with a rifle produced in some god-forsaken Reichskommissariat can hope to match a true son of Germany. We will demonstrate to the world once and for all that German steel, backed by German discipline, is the finest in the world! Only ensuring the continuation of our tradition of high-quality soldiers and equipment will keep us safe from the tide of treachery rising around us."
 GGR_is_on_the_workfloor_desc:0 "German industry remains unrivalled, and we must keep it that way to secure victory! Our factories are filled with strong, dedicated working men, but they slacken and grow restless as word of the war reaches them - this is unacceptable! The bosses must drive them to work harder than ever before, for every bullet that arrives too late could see another valiant soldier of the Reich murdered by the traitors. Failure to dedicate one's entire heart and soul to work in this crucial time is tantamount to desertion, and will be punished as such!"
 GGR_supplies_from_ukraine_desc:0 "An unfortunate but unavoidable side-effect of the Reich's recent expansion is the stretching of our supply lines and the shortage of vital resources accompanying it. The traitors have access to all the industry and resources within the lands they illegally hold, including those which are central to the war effort! Thankfully, with Ukraine secured for the rightful Führer, its vast supplies of oil, steel and grain remain available to us - a very useful thing indeed, with our lands once again riven by war. The Balkans remain secure and difficult for any invader to take, so our eastern supply lines will be redirected to travel through that region alone. We cannot afford further shortages now."
 GGR_is_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Our soldiers have fought long and hard, many for years on end. Still, we must demand one more great effort from the Heer. No matter how many officers and spoilt, ungrateful grunts have defected, the truest and noblest of the Grenadiers remain at our side. It is they who shall carry us to victory, and all possible measures must be taken to maximize their potential. Whether that is wages to keep them loyal, food to keep them happy or pervitin to keep them awake and active, the loyal soldiery will have what they require, and give their all in thanks to the Führer! In this hour, no alternative to absolute dedication is permissible."
 GGR_soldiers_from_the_balkans_desc:0 "The Balkan Garrison is the hard core of the Wehrmacht. Cornwall might have been the best posting, but no amount of watching over shepherds and fishermen could make that garrison the match of the Balkan men! Those grizzled veterans have been fighting a ceaseless guerilla war against rebellious subhumans and Bolshevik partisans for nearly thirty years. More importantly, they have remained at arm's length from the political intrigues of Germania; they are a strictly loyal and obedient force of soldiers and airmen at the Führer's beck and call. It's a good thing that we have subdued all major partisan groups in the region, for men such as they are needed more now than ever. They will be recalled to the Reich and placed directly on the frontlines - the traitors will have a nasty surprise waiting for them if they expected green conscripts!"
 GGR_no_more_militarists_desc:0 "The question of how to deal with the traitor Speidel has been a frequent topic of discussion within OKW. The answer, of course, is obvious: no talks with turncoats! The Führer recognizes that no military man ambitious enough to take independent action can ever be trusted. As though the simple act of treason were not bad enough, Speidel is an infamous crypto-Speerite who has time and again questioned the core tenets of National Socialism! Some say he even refuses to accept our deserved right to rule over the lesser races of the world! We will crush this German Judas and all who follow him, as we would any other enemy of the Fatherland!"
 GGR_talk_to_the_rat_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is a traitor, but he is nowhere near as dangerous as Schörner. Speerism is all but dead; he represents no ideological threat to us, only a minor strategic one. Perhaps his apolitical nature and dedication to the preservation of German lives can be turned to our advantage. Schörner represents a threat not only to our new order, but also to the Reich itself - his deranged ambition would see countless millions thrown into the meat grinder for no tangible gain whatsoever! Speidel is not a strong-willed man, and an appeal of equal parts reason and logic might sway him to at least refrain from attacking us and focus his forces on Schörner instead. We can ill afford a war on three fronts, after all..."
 GGR_drive_out_the_villains_desc:0 "The presence of traitors' feet on German soil is a grave insult to the honor of our race and nation. With every day that passes, more gullible fools flock to their banners, spreading the twin poisons of militarism and pacifism. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formulation and execution of a plan to push the renegades out of the Fatherland itself. This will be a legendary cleansing, the likes of which have not been seen since the Bürgerkrieg, to purify Germany of its ills and carve in history the eternal glory and righteousness of our one true Führer! No mercy will be shown to the bearers of this rot and decay, who threaten the very foundations of our world!"
 GGR_germany_under_one_banner_desc:0 "Our situation remains precarious, but the worst of the fires have been extinguished as the traitors have been driven from the Reich proper. Our forces have completely secured the German heartlands and are now busying themselves with mopping up the last holdouts and partisan cells. Speidel and Schörner have fled like the cowards they are, but their forces are already rallying in the Reichskommissariats aligned to their respective sides. Owing to the breadth of our conquests and the chronic disloyalty of the various Reichskommissars, they remain in possession of a great deal of land, resources and manpower. The fight must be taken beyond Germany, but it will be a long, hard road to victory from here on out."
 GGR_use_the_slaves_desc:0 "What is a slave but a machine made of meat, to be used and discarded as its master wishes? Even with our healthy surplus, we have historically placed too much value on the lives and wellbeing of slaves, thinking of them as a precious commodity - this lax attitude ends now! They are a resource to be spent as necessary, and there is no shortage of cheap fuel for war's furnace these days. We must purge the last vestiges of sympathy for these subhumans from our society and put them to maximum possible use; no more breaks, sleep, food or even water unless they prove their particular value. For every fleshy machine that breaks down, there are millions more available to replace it, so why fret over a few more bodies committed to the crematoriums every day?"
 GGR_punish_the_deserters_desc:0 "As the war rages on, the chaff separates from the wheat. Accounts reach us of entire battalions defecting, refusing to follow orders or even retreating without permission. The snake Schörner has always been right about one thing, at least - acts of supreme cowardice cannot be tolerated. Harsh punishments for deserters have been the norm for decades, but with the very existence of the Reich on the line, all disciplinary efforts must be redoubled! If a thousand must die to push a million forward, then so be it! Anyone who refuses to serve in combat will serve on the firing line!"
 GGR_harsher_quotas_desc:0 "Even citizen and volunteer workers continually fail to meet our requirements and expectations! It is shocking and disgraceful to see this kind of unpatriotic laziness in vital war industries, especially considering the stakes of the current conflict. Henceforth, proper military discipline will be employed in all industries, and quotas raised to the necessary levels. For a working man to give anything less than the entirety of his being to the national effort is just as treasonous as siding with the enemy! We'll instate 18-hour working days if we have to; nothing less than total militarization of the factories will bring us victory!"
 GGR_attack_the_pacifists_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of human nature that the common people never really want war. More often than not, they merely lust for the idea of crushing and dominating their nation's enemies. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? However, it is not the soft-hearted masses that dictate policy, but the Führer! The weakling pacifists infesting the Reich's heartland are as much a threat to the morale of our nation as deserters and cowards - thankfully, there is an easy way to turn the people against them and bring the populace to the Führer's bidding. All we need do is remind the people of this war's true stakes, which will expose the pacifists' lack of patriotism and endangerment of the nation. This has never failed us before, and once carried out will ensure that nobody will complain when those treasonous scum are dragged from their houses and shot as the cowards they are."
 GGR_men_on_the_frontlines_desc:0 "What do we even have men in the factories for? What value does a man truly hold if he will not don a helmet and carry a rifle into combat for the sake of his country? We face a life or death struggle for the future of the Reich - now is the hour for each and every true Aryan man to live up to the standards envisioned by the great Hitler! We need everyone to fight this war - from every floor of every factory in every Gau! Any who refuse to down their ploughshares for swords will be considered traitors to the cause and dealt with appropriately!"
 GGR_women_in_the_factories_desc:0 "The Aryan-Feminists bleated for years about wanting the opportunity to work in factories like their husbands; now, they shall have it. With the men shipped off to more suitable occupations, we have a skilled labor shortage that slaves cannot fulfil. True, these women are lacking in experience and the strength of soul that makes men superior workers, but this is Judgement Day for the Reich! Extreme measures must be taken at home just as readily as on the frontlines, and if that includes violating sacrosanct gender roles, then so be it."
 GGR_pows_in_the_camps_desc:0 "All these captured traitors are languishing in POW camps, eating our bread and occupying our guards. That bread should be going to the troops, those guards should be fighting for the Reich, and those prisoners should be making themselves useful! If they would claim to be the true sons of Germany, then let them try and prove it in the work camps! Perhaps their claims will be verified, or maybe they will redeem themselves through back-breaking labor - "Work will set you free", after all. While we're at it, perhaps the numerous civilians who have yet to prove their worth should be... redefined. Redefined as Schörnerite spies, for instance, rather than mere cowards and slackers."

 GGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "Once more, the Reich has fallen into chaos. Göring may have been our preferred stalking horse in the Reichstag but his gluttony and incompetence have cost us dearly. His economic mismanagement has sunk the Reich to a new low, his flamboyance and extravagance emptying its coffers and putting its slaves into open revolt. The German people have been infected with his laziness, his femininity, and his cowardice. Fortunately there is no character so low that righteous war cannot rectify it."
 GGR_stand_for_your_fatherland_desc:0 "Most of our citizens have sat idle these past few years, content to let slaves do the work. The Wehrmacht has become the only constant, always requiring more men to maintain the balance of our empire. It is vital that the people understand the importance of what we do, that they join us in our purging of the rot that has corrupted the Reich. Goebbels may be long dead but his lessons hold true - the people must be galvanised by propaganda. Let the posters and banners fly. It is better they make the choice to enlist on their own. It lets them think they still have a choice."
 GGR_war_in_the_factories_desc:0 "This is a total war. Goebbels understood the value of making the war felt by everyone, from the front lines to the fields to the factories. We must ensure our workers know the importance of their labour, and redouble their efforts to produce arms for the fatherland. The factory floor will be reorganised into a home front, with clear ranks established for every worker. Work squads will be directed at their tasks by floor sergeants, and every task will be timed down to the minute, ensuring when a mistake is made it will not be made again. When we are done, the production line will be indistinguishable from the front line."
 GGR_war_in_the_fields_desc:0 "Out here in the fields, you fight for your meals. All one can see for miles on end is the Reich. All one sees is the front line. Europe is consumed in warfare once more, and it is essential that the soldiers understand that.\n\nIf we do not hold Ukraine, whose bread will feed their families back home? Danish pork and butter are a staple at every table, Bohemian cars fill the streets of every city, Baltic farms are home to a cousin of every other man in this army. If we do not win this war, we risk losing everything the Reich has fought for for the past century. We fight for what is ours."
 GGR_war_in_the_mind_desc:0 "This war is perhaps the most important we have ever fought. If the Reich cannot be halted in its fall, if Göring and Speidel are allowed to continue to destroy it then all is lost and the Führer's dream will be dead. Our troops must understand this - they must not falter in their mission, they must show no mercy, and they must never surrender. Thus far they have been found lacking. The number of rounds wasted on deserters is too high when they could be put to use against the enemy. We shall require our troops swear oaths of loyalty, and officers instructed to keep a closer eye on their men. And every man will keep an eye on his comrades - for there are traitors around every street corner."
 GGR_volkssturm_desc:0 "To achieve a great future blood must be spilled. Just because one is not eligible for conscription into the Wehrmacht does not mean one cannot be of use to their country. The Volkssturm shall serve as a home for those too old for the Wehrmacht, those too infirm to drill with a rifle and those women who are called upon to serve the Reich in its time of great need. Though their equipment may be lacking in quality, their training substandard and their uniforms virtually nonexistent, they will fill holes in the line just as well as any Heer Soldat. It will serve as a useful means of disposal for critical of our way of thinking."
 GGR_all_traitors_shall_bleed_desc:0 "Our efforts have proven successful so far, with the flow of fresh recruits to the front line broadening into a torrent. There will always be elements of cowardice that must be rooted out however - the common soldier must be taught the value of discipline and diligence. Anyone attempting to undermine the war effort, by words or by actions, is a traitor and will be treated as such. The Reich is a machine of flesh and metal, and when a cog gets stuck or a spring breaks, you replace it. We have neither the time nor the inclination to waste our efforts with trials or prisons. Shoot them."
 GGR_those_without_desc:0 "We had hoped that Göring would prove a willing ally as Führer - while he may be vain and gauche he is a military man. Sadly it was not to be, his leadership limp-wristed, his monetary management ham-fisted and his policies ill-thought. He has proven truculent in our attempts to steer him and now he has bucked the reins and risks bringing the Reich we have fought so hard for crashing into a ditch. He must die, and those that followed him in life will follow him to the firing line.\n\nEnding that glory hound Speidel will merely be the cherry on top of the cake. From the battlefields of the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line to the balconies of the Berghof he has followed us, always casting his shadow. He has hindered us for too long, and it will be a pleasure to see him swinging from a rope. "
 GGR_and_those_within_desc:0 "Examples have been made, and we have been patient enough. Soldiers linger away from their duties, eager to spend as much time away from the front as possible. They make excuses, hide in their barracks, spend time on frivolities like lunch breaks. No longer. Spare time is wasted time, and wasted time is dereliction of duty.\n\nThe newly issued 'Richtlinien für die Behandlung der Zeitverschwender' will crack down on these time wasters. Any soldier found away from the front lines without written orders from a superior officer will be hanged. Any officer who fails to carry out these orders will be shot. What more fitting punishment for those who refuse to defend German women and children?"
 GGR_no_retreat_desc:0 "This front is too vital to fall without a fight. No matter how many men they throw at us, no matter how many bodies we must expend, we will bleed for every second we must buy for our forces across the Reich to muster against the enemy. There will be not one step back for our men, not until they reach the very walls of [ROOT.Capital.GetName].\n\nOf course, the Reichsmarshall and his staff are too vital to leave to the enemy. They will evacuate when the time is right. "
 GGR_shorten_the_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Even we are willing to admit the Wehrmacht has become somewhat bloated since its glory days in the forties. Our ranks are filled with upjumped, inexperienced officers who scarcely remember the Second World War, let alone the first. They are more a hindrance than a help - what use can they be commanding men in combat if they have never seen the front lines?\n\nWe shall do them a favour and shorten the chain of command. Those without experience will be demoted to NCO ranks, those that complain will find themselves no different to the Soldaten they once commanded. Perhaps if they survive, they can work their way back up the ranks."
 GGR_slaves_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Slaves are one of the few things we have in abundance. They may be lazy and insubordinate, their work shoddy and substandard, but they provide the majority of the Reich's labour. They are many and individually quite worthless - it would be a mistake not to utilise them in our hour of need. Their blood is inferior but they take a bullet just as well as any Aryan.\n\nPromise them freedom, or food, or a day off - we have no obligation to follow through. March them at gunpoint and send them at the enemy barricades. Every one that dies is a German life saved, and maybe after the war there won't be so many of them to worry about."
 GGR_nowhere_left_to_run_desc:0 "A cornered dog is the most dangerous kind. Every man, woman and child here knows their duty, to defend this land to their dying breath, and with all avenues of escape cut off even the most desperate coward must stand and fight. When men are ordered to march, we expect them to march. When they are ordered to kill, we expect that they kill. And when they are ordered to die, we expect them to die. Any less is treason."
 GGR_a_lost_cause_desc:0 "The situation here has become untenable. The front lines are dissolving, with deserters fleeing faster than our blocking squads can shoot them. All the same, we can ensure the enemy gains nothing of value from this land. Land mines and indiscriminate artillery fire will slow their advance long enough to extract men and materiel, while we set light to the fields and salt the earth beneath with defoliants. Ammo dumps will be rigged with time delayed bombs, sending any would-be scavengers to kingdom come. There is always the next Reichskommissariat."
 GGR_exhaust_the_workers_desc:0 "Scorched earth tactics do not merely extend to the land itself. Blood and soil are inextricably linked - it would be ridiculous to burn the crops and leave those who tend them to replant them the next day. They must be wrung for every last drop of effort before we evacuate, every ounce of arms and armaments and supplies taken. If they must work in double shifts to ensure that we eventually take the helm, so be it. When we return they will no doubt be grateful we spared their lives."
 GGR_dispose_of_the_useless_desc:0 "Slaves have always been disposable - that is their purpose. If we cannot take them with us to the next front, so be it. Round them up and put a bullet in them before we leave. The work camps they once occupied are valuable assets and it would be foolish to leave them intact for the next contender. Shell them, bomb them, set them alight. There is no sense in evacuating those with no reason to live."
 GGR_burn_capital_desc:0 "A capital is temporary, for we are always on the march. If this one does not suit us we will find a new one, one more suitable for our needs. Of course, it would be hypocritical to leave this city intact and ready starve when we have demolished the factories and salted the earth behind us in the name of a better Reich. They do not even have slaves any more. It is kinder to set it alight behind us when we leave."

GGR_ein_volk_desc:0 "The Madness of Göring and Schörner has collapsed like a house of cards. Now once again Germans are shooting on Germans. The failure of National Socialism in it's current state is evident. Now it falls to Speidel to restore the Reich to some semblance of sanity. If that means reform then so be it. Working with students, working with partisans or even abandoning RK's outright. The Reich will be reformed into something more reasonable. It doesn't have a choice."
GGR_promises_of_freedom_desc:0 "If the German people as well as all the other people currently within the Reich want to see their chains broken and a measure of freedom restored, then they have no choice, but to stay with us. While our promises have to be vague at the moment, once we have triumphed over Schörner and Göring surely we will reform the Reich into something more "pleasant" than what it has been in the past."
GGR_rally_the_army_desc:0 "While a lot of the army still follows Schörner or Göring, even the forces that have joined us are still somewhat reluctant to accept Speidel as their new leader. In this critical situation we can't afford to let lingering distrust impact our effort to save the Reich. Let's remind them, that Speidel is the saviour of Germania during the first civil war, the vanquisher of Himmler's coup during the West russian War and that now he will save Germany once again. Unsere letzte Hoffnung heißt Speidel."
GGR_rally_the_students_desc:0 "The students of the Reich have suffered much in the recent years, between the first Civil War, Görings crackdown and being sent off to die in the various wars. Hence their distrust of any Wehrmacht general, even one that actually wants to improve their situation is natural. Speidel will have a lot of convincing to do to gain their support. However if they want to see reform of the Reich within their lifetime then they will have no choice but to support Speidel. "
GGR_a_united_front_desc:0 "It took a lot of talking, haggling and pleading, but finally the Students and the parts of the Wehrmacht that have sided with us have agreed to form a united front against our enemies. It's condition is still brittle, but with time and hopefully success it will form into a front of solid iron that will have the strength to do what it must: Save the Reich from its current self."
GGR_call_to_the_partisans_desc:0 "While dealing with the various collaborators that have supported Reich, Speidel has inevitably gotten contact with various groups that are willing to rise up as partisans, but whoms ideological composition is not so far away as to be untenable. Directly helping potential enemies of the Reich might not be the clean choice, but giving a hand to let these partisan groups rise up in our current enemies territory can prove very valuable."
GGR_the_iberians_desc:0 "Ever since Iberia fell to our invasion, the peninsula has become a mess of partisans and garrisons fighting it out. With the Civil War this situation only intensified. With the number and variety of resistance organizations very large, it is easy to simply support a few of those to rise up in pro-Schörner and pro-Göring controlled areas,but not in ours."
GGR_the_slavs_desc:0 "The Schörner controlled areas include many of the former and current slavic inhabited lands. Having them rise up in an attempt to liberate their lands is not only likely to happen with or without our help, if we give them a bit of support here and there, they will likely draw away a significant amount of hostile forces away from our current areas of engagement. And no matter who wins, we can just deal with them afterwards."
GGR_the_scandinavians_desc:0 "Scandinavia, especially the valuable mines of Lappland and northern Sweden have seen large influxes of slave workers recently. With the territory being lowly populated, vast in scale and difficult to control, it is a prime area for an uprising. A bit of help here and there can help this to come about quicker. Still the emptiness of the region will prevent the uprising from spreading too far into our own areas of control."
GGR_all_for_a_prosperous_europe_desc:0 "With various partisan uprisings as well as our own war effort underway, a glorious future for Europe might now be within reach. Speidels Germany and it's vision is clear: All of Europe shall become prosperous once more under our leadership, the leadership of the Unity Pakt"
GGR_know_when_to_fight_desc:0 "This war is not yet over! We may have been pushed back and delayed temporarily, but we will fight on from one of those Reichskommissariat loyal to us. And there are enough of those around that we can repeat that process time and time again. Still we will fight to the last for the vision that Hans Speidel represents: A Reich of reason and not of madness that can hold up to all challenges."
GGR_call_troops_from_overseas_desc:0 "The fight for the heart of the Reich is the most important front in this whole conflict, but where Speidel is also important. We should recall troops from overseas and those areas less relevant to our cause and concentrate on securing our central area of operations."
GGR_the_saviour_of_germany_desc:0 "He is the saviour of the West Russian war, He is the protector of Germania, He is our last hope for change in the Reich,He is Hans Speidel! His popularity has to be emphasized and used, if we want to have a chance in fighting this war. Lets use all available means for a morale boosting campaign. All hail Speidel saviour and regenerator of the Reich."
GGR_and_to_withdraw_desc:0 "It is no shame to withdraw when you have to. There are others on our side who can carry on the fight. And just such a situation is happening right now. We have to leave, before the situation becomes bad enough, that even an orderly evacuation is impossible. Speidel will leave, but rest assured that he will return."
GGR_evacuate_the_troops_desc:0 "While the struggle over here is turning out less than favourable to us, our friends and forces overseas are doing much better, especially if those forces that remain can be transported over to them. Thus that is what we will do. Ready the troops and ready the ships, it is time to defend Germany elsewhere!"
GGR_native_rule_desc:0 "Our conventional and symmetric method of warfare has failed in this region. We now have no choice but to retreat elsewhere to fight another day. The natives of the nation have no such luxury however, defeat or not they will fight to live another day. Leaving them some equipment we can't afford to evacuate in such a short time, surely will help them to continue their resistance against our mutual enemies, long after we have left."
GGR_evacuation_desc:0 "It's over and this RK has fallen. Help is on the way to evacuate us, if only we can hold out long enough. 84 days. Just 84 days and we are saved."

The second is Turkey, which is famed for its vital chromium mines and dominance of the Bosphorus strait, as well as a land border with the Italians, which could prove to be most useful in the future. Last is the cursed Slavs to our east; the Siberian plains are rich in resources and enemies alike. We shouldn't neglect these flies, they must be crushed if we are to secure our eastern borders once and for all.\n\nOnce we have crushed and secured all of the aforementioned foes, we should be more than ready to tackle our rivals to our south!

It is best that we invest in the training of operatives that shall infiltrate deep into enemy lines - if we are successful in disrupting Italy's defensive encampments it will ensure that our naval invasion shall suffer less strained supply lines. Moreover, if we are successful it may limit German casualties when we land on the beaches of Italy. A little planning will do much for us when the time comes: be assured, however, that it will all be worth it."

 GGR_the_time_has_come_desc:0 "The time has come to prepare our forces for the trip to the beaches. The Kriegsmarine has successfully achieved every goal it has set out to achieve: with the Mediterranean Sea secure and the Italian fleet decimated, the way is open for a large-scale amphibious landing. There is now a critical window of opportunity, before land defenses are fortified and the beaches turn into killing fields: we must land the soldiers of the Heer as soon as possible. And when we have landed in strength, the Heer will display its untamed might against the pitiful remnants of the Italian army. And then - how did the Latin go again? We will engage in, ah, making a desert and calling it peace."
