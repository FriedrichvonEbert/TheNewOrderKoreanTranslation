 IBR.666.t:0 "Leaving the Triumvirate"
 IBR.666.d:0 "With the catastrophic breakdown and dissolution of the Triumvirate, Iberia now finds itself alone and adrift. Significant reforms may come into play as the Caudillos determine which course of action is necessary."
 IBR.666.a:0 "We Stand Alone."
 IBR.1015.t:0 "The Reich's Last Conquest"
 IBR.1015.d:0 "Adolf Hitler received great applause on television today as he announced that the Reich has successfully defeated both America and Japan in its race to the moon. Eberhard Köllner, using a rocket based upon the A9/A10 design from WW2, and as a member of a team led by acclaimed scientist Wernher von Braun, successfully landed on Luna, broadcasted in multiple angles and with thousands of pictures taken. Celebrations have sparked across Germany, while America and Japan have both proclaimed they will continue the race and that it does not end with simply one man landing on a rock.\n\nThe news has received mixed responses in Iberia, and Caudillo Franco released a short and terse statement in response. Rumors from his inner circle state that all members of the government were greatly displeased that The Union has yet to even develop such technology, and was quite angry that the Germans were the ones to land first.\n\nAlready, several speculators have begun to question whether or not the Germans staged the landing for the propaganda, and conspiracy theories are abound."
 IBR.1015.a:0 "The Race is not over yet!"
 IBR.1016.t:0 "Day of the Union"
 IBR.1016.d:0 "Today is a wondrous summer day as everyone across the Union enjoys a public holiday to celebrate the anniversary of our two nations being drawn together into one mighty whole. Caudillo Franco gave a rousing speech before an adoring crowd in both Portuguese and Spanish. At the same time, the elderly Caudillo Salazar also appeared and gave a speech calling for all peoples of Iberia to throw themselves into the great task of restoring the greatness Iberia once held."
 IBR.1016.a:0 "A Union for us all!"
 IBR.1017.t:0 "Day of Portuguese Solidarity."
 IBR.1017.d:0 "The date was not a mistake, clearly placed to overshadow the historic date the Portuguese broke from Spanish control in 1640. The Day of Solidarity is a much more somber occasion, meant to remind the people of Portugal, and of Iberia at large why exactly the Union was born and what it's truly meant to preserve."
 IBR.1017.a:0 "The Union will preserve Portugal."
 IBR.1018.t:0 "The State of the Iberian Union"
 IBR.1018.d:0 "Iberia had not been united since 1840, but the rebirth of a United Iberia was not had in mass celebrations and parties but in fire. The Germans had just invaded the Portugese colonies, which brought realization to the Portuguese and Spanish that Hitler had no plans for non-Germans in his new world. The German Reich was massive, so to counter it, Portugal and Spain united into the Iberian Union. Germany soon built a dam in the Gibraltar Strait but this quickly decimated the economies of all the Mediterranean countries who relied on trade through the now shrunken sea.\n\nWith a profound dislike for the Germans as their only bond, The Iberian Union formed the Triumvirate with Italy and Turkey, but relations with the two have been souring lately, and it seems the only possible way to save the Triumvirate, is the upcoming Malta Conference between the three."
 IBR.1018.a:0 "I will do my best to preserve our power"
 IBR.1019.t:0 "The Gibraltar Dam"
 IBR.1019.d:0 "Ever since the Germans built that God-forsaken dam in the Gibraltar straits, our economy has been weakened and our people with it. The dam is near collapse and on the verge of killing millions in the land that was once sea, and we're the only ones who stand in the way of it."
 IBR.1019.a:0 "We shall not forget" 
 
 IBR.1110.t:0 "O Mar" #if franco is dead (74 divorce)
 IBR.1110.d:0 "De Valcárcel came in on that evening. As the sun set and the two talked, it became as clear as the waters that reflected against the light that this union could not be. They had to let go. Caetano did not protest, and understood what needed to be done. The union of Franco and Salazar was dead, and it needed to fail, for the better of their two nations.\n\n'We need to let go,' he said.\n\nIt must have seemed obvious for them at the time to create this union. To be able to bring about prosperity for both their countries, to defend against the Germans by our border, it all seemed so clear... but the years drew longer and longer, and still, nothing but a whisper from the other side of the mountains, and yet, it would seem that the union they made was met with nothing but failure. Terrorists, anti-unionists, nationalists, and republicans forced us all to very edge of life and death, and now with both of them gone there is no path forward.\n\nCaetano sat silently, calmly accepting that it needed to be done. It was sadly the only way to avoid utter catastrophe. He once had a genuine optimism for the Union, and accepted his duties as Caudillo with pride and a hope that the nation could be saved. No matter the memories he had fighting for the integrity of the Union, all the sacrifices that were made to survive, the great bonds made along the way, the smiles and the cheer from Portuguese and Spanish alike...\n\nIt had to be done. And so, it would seem, Portugal and Spain will go their separate ways. For a country he so loved would split apart, two brothers drifting away with the wind, never to be reunited again. It would be the last time the sea would ever kiss the sand; it would be the last time Iberia could be whole.\n\n'Goodbye, and for all that it is worth, I am sorry.'"
 IBR.1110.a:0 "É hora de deixar ir..."
 
 IBR.1122.t:0 "O Mar" #if salazar is dead (66-74 divorce)
 IBR.1122.d:0 "Caetano came in on that evening. As the sun set and the two talked, it became as clear as the waters that reflected against the light that this union could not be. They had to let go.

Terrorists, anti-unionists, nationalists, republicans, and the death of Salazar has forced us to the very edge of life and death.\n\nFranco sat silently, frustrated but knowing that it needed to be done. He could no longer maintain that same optimism he once had when Salazar was alive. No matter the memories he had along Madrid, with Portuguese and Spanish troops fighting alongside to fend off the foreigners who were holding the very core of the nation as hostage, no matter the memories of bonding, the smiles and the cheer from everyone from Cádiz all the way to Navarra...\n\nIt had to be done. And so, it would seem, Portugal would leave the Union on the 1st of April. For a country he so loved would part itself into the sea, like a pearl, never to be grasped and held against the bosom of the Spanish nation, never to be forced to meld through whatever artificial dams would force them together, for it would be the last time the sea would ever kiss the sand, it would be the last time Iberia could be whole.\n\n'Goodbye, and for all that it is worth, I am sorry.'"

 ###########################The Death of Salazar
 IBR.1020.t:0 "The Death of Salazar"
 IBR.1020.d:0 "Today, the housekeeping staff of São Bente Palace were horrified to find the corpse of Antonio Salazar in his bath. The body was quickly removed for an autopsy and burial, but the knowledge of his death managed to quickly escape the circle of secrecy that it was intended to remain in until the Iberian government can come up with an official story. Already, numerous underground forces within the Union are mobilizing, and worrying rumors of sedition within the Portuguese state have come to our attention.\n\nWith keeping the beloved Caudillo's death a secret being no longer an option, Iberian authorities must put all of their resources in play in order to keep the Union stable. Already, tanks have been spotted moving down roads in Lisbon, and martial law has been declared in several regions in Portugal.\n\nCaudillo Franco and Salazar's designated successor, Marcello José das Neves Alves Caetano, have already condemned any forces conspiring to take advantage of Salazar's death, but it does not appear that this will provide a conclusive end to the political chaos in Portugal. It appears that the only thing left to do is crack down as hard as possible, and divert every possible resource to ensuring the Union stays together."
 IBR.1020.a:0 "Move to secure Portugal, now!"

 #######Iberian Wars Initiating Events
 
 IBR.1022.t:0 "The Last Pillar"
 IBR.1022.d:0 "Iberia had always been naught but a geographical construct. Kept together not by common identity or purpose but by fear. When the dreaded German invasion failed to materialize the Union quickly lost its purpose. With any hope of genuine reform being killed in the cradle the Union could only survive through the sheer force of will brought by its twin Caudillos. When Salazar died and the Union endured some had hoped that it had turned into something more. That something genuine had been born. A common Iberian identity that could endure beyond the passing of the giants that had founded it. These dreams were foolish\n\nWith the passing of Francisco Franco, some mourn the loss of their savior, some rejoice at the death of a tyrant, some shed tears of regret at what could have been while others vow to maintain his legacy. Yet all fear for the future. The last pillar maintaining Iberia has fallen. The second Union seems doomed to end in the same way as its predecessor did."
 IBR.1022.a:0 "By the sword."
 
 IBR.1021.t:0 "Tensions in Portugal Explode"
 IBR.1021.d:0 "The powder keg has finally exploded.\n\nEver since the death of Caudillo Salazar Iberia a fuse had been lit and had been heading towards an end from which Iberia could never recover. Each political event that had followed the unfortunate demise of the Portuguese Caudillo had added to this flame. First a number of Portuguese politicians had secretly initiated talks on how to manage a peaceful secession from the Union. Seeing the writing on the wall with the way Franco dealt with the political crisis they knew the only successful future Portugal could forge in the future was one on their own. With their political considerations that Portugal would lose influence in the Union they increased the strength of the flame.\n\nSome documents from these meetings have however made their ways into the hands of Basque separatists who without having the full picture came to the joyous conclusion that an imminent armed struggle would ensue between the secessionist Portugal and the remnants of the Iberian government. For them it was hence the perfect time to finally stand up for their own freedom and independence. The next bit of fuel to the flame was added.\n\nAs the news was carried in the wind, between distorted and reshaped to fit the agendas of various other splinter groups, the flame finally had found its end destination. With the uprising of the Basques following a few days of rapid preparation the peninsular began to be rocked by brutal civil war for the second time this century."
 IBR.1021.a:0 "The half island is in flames."
 
 IBR.1023.t:0 "Anarchy in Iberia"
 IBR.1023.d: "Trouble had been brewing across the half peninsula for a while now. Observers, both foreign and national, have argued that intense political incompetence in the heart of Iberian governance had detrimental effects to the stability of the Union. While localities desperately attempted to mitigate the damages caused by the poor political decisions made in Madrid, terrorist groups and freedom fighters had been quietly organising themselves to take advantage of the situation. This, in their eyes, was an opportune time to finally rid themselves of the hated Iberia yoke that had been oppressing them.\n\nNo matter the level of strict censorship applied to the national and local news, the populace nonetheless had felt the detrimental effects of decisions made at the top. Popular opinion, as much as it could be observed in these times of crisis, had switched from apathy into something far more sinister. No one now seemed to be able to stop the forces of history converging once again in Iberia. For the second time in a century the home of two of the greatest empires the world is descending into anarchy."
 IBR.1023.a:0 "Y entonces el diablo vino a visitarnos"
 
 IBR.1024.t:0 "A Crisis Gone too Far"
 IBR.1024.d:0 "Many philosophers and political theorists have placed the blame for political turmoil at the feet of poor economic conditions. After all, if people cannot even afford to meet their basic standards of need what do their have to lose in hurting those at the top who have made it so for them.\n\nFranco had in his pursuit of hard-line falangist economic policy not only alienated a great number of government officials but also tanked the already struggling Iberian economy. Day by day the newspapers were filled with headlines of leaders of capital and other economic figures taking their lives. The average citizen fared no better as even the spontaneously established black market began to run out of goods.\n\nProtest and economic standstill defined each city on the peninsula. As normal people began to turn their anger against the regime into action, a number of underground terror groups and freedom organizations saw their opportunity to finally push for the results they wanted.\n\nThe stability of the once so promising union had been undermined to a point where attempts from Madrid to rectify the situation were met either with harsh opposition or proven ineffectual. Seemingly the only answer now is violence." 
 IBR.1024.a:0 "The end of the Iberian project."
 
 IBR.1027.t:0 "A repeat of history"
 IBR.1027.d:0 "Franco's lack of action to remedy the concerns raised by opposition to his power grab, following Salazar's death, have led in many places around the Union to declare open revolt. Portugal, a particular flashpoint considering the issues around representation, has entirely slipped out of the grasp of the central government. While news of rioting and upheaval are coming in droves out of the region, Lisbon has entirely ceased communications with Madrid.\n\nThis however sadly was not the only concern. Other groups which had previously been hostile to the Iberian government have also taken this opportunity of crisis to break out in rebellion. Insurgents have been reported in a variety of Spanish cities. Their goal, unlike the Portuguese call for representation, was not entirely clear.\n\nIt was obvious to the Caudillo that Portugal would have to be suppressed on a large scale, but now even his own nation was wasting away around him. Traitors in his own ranks were making themselves visible. Previous Iberian loyalists who had seen their chance to change the system through working inside it had also lost hope when Franco had refused to cede ground to the opposition. Realizing that now the superstructure they had wanted could only be achieved through other means they as well have taken up arms against the new dictatorship. In the middle of all of this, Franco, by now besieged from every angle, still held onto his hopes for stable Iberia under his leadership. It is unlikely that he will let his opponents take that from him without a fight."
 IBR.1027.a:0 "As Iberia dies the world watches on."

 
 #######The End Of Iberia
 IBR.1113.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - West Africa"
 IBR.1113.d:0 "With Iberia's days counted, the negotiation teams of Portugal and Spain are now arguing over the colonies in West Africa. Composed of Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania, the only deal that both teams have reached for now is that those territories owned by the Kingdom of Morocco will undoubtedly go to Spain.\n\nThe main area of disagreement between the two teams is Mauritania as this region wasn't owned by neither nation prior to the creation of Iberia. The Portuguese team argues it should be theirs to compensate for the loss of Angola and Mozambique, but the Spanish team is saying that the loss of those colonies were Portugal's fault. The area itself is plagued with bandits that spill over to the southern part of Western Sahara, so some members of the Spanish team believe it would be a good idea to give these areas to Portugal and that way take a weight off Spanish future responsibilities in Africa. Both teams are still arguing but a decision must be made..."
 IBR.1113.a:0 "Give Portugal the interior Sahara and Mauritania."
 IBR.1113.b:0 "Give Portugal everything south of Morocco."
 IBR.1113.c:0 "Give Portugal nothing!"
 
 IBR.1114.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - Equatorial Africa"
 IBR.1114.d:0 "In an unprecedented move, both negotiating teams have reached a deal over the territories of Equatorial Africa. Arguing that this region was split between both countries before Iberia existed, it has been decided that those territories owned by Spain would go back to them while those owned by Portugal would return to them. The news has been very well received by the governments of both nations, that hope to continue reaching good deals to avoid future tensions."
 IBR.1114.a:0 "A good deal"
 
 IBR.1115.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - Island Territories"
 IBR.1115.d:0 "In another surprising move, both negotiating teams have reached a deal over the island archipelagos owned by Iberia. Arguing that all the island groups were already owned by both countries before Iberia existed, it has been decided that those islands owned by Spain would go back to them while those owned by Portugal would return to them. The news has been very well received by the governments of both nations, that hope to continue reaching good deals to avoid future tensions."
 IBR.1115.a:0 "Another good deal"
 
 IBR.1116.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - Guinea"
 IBR.1116.d:0 "In what seems to be a recurring move, both negotiating teams have reached a deal over the colony of Guiné. Arguing that the colony was previously owned by Portugal and that as such most people there speak Portuguese and business in the region is closer to Lisboa than to Madrid, both negotiating teams have decided that Portugal should own the colony once Iberia fully splits. The news has been very well received by the governments of both nations, that hope to continue reaching good deals to avoid future tensions."
 IBR.1116.a:0 "Another deal? Marvelous!"
 
 IBR.1117.t:0 "Restoring The Embassies"
 IBR.1117.d:0 "As part of the process of splitting up Iberia, the process of restoring the embassies between the two soon-to-be countries has begun. While they won't be operative until the country is fully divided, records and material is already being shipped to the buildings that will host the diplomatic missions.\n\nBoth sides have already named their respective ambassadors, even if they might change the second after Iberia is gone. These two designees are now in charge of overseeing this process finish without any kind of delays. The Spanish negotiating team has declared that they don't like the naming of ambassadors so soon, specially since it comes with the full salary, but the Portuguese team has replied that the Spanish delegation in Lisbon has already occupied the building designated for the future embassy and the top workers there have began to meet with local people of power with the title of workers of the Spanish diplomatic mission in Lisbon. It seems that up until the last second, both sides won't agree on anything."
 IBR.1117.a:0 "May our relations ever be positive."
 
 IBR.1118.t:0 "Auditing The Supply Dumps"
 IBR.1118.d:0 "With the focus now on splitting the armed forces, it has been decided that the first step in diving all the supplies that the Federal Armed Forces have used during their existence. Although both negotiating teams have members that believe an even split of the armament is the best solution, there are also those that disagree with this solution.\n\nThe most radical members of the Spanish team believe that, since military industry controlled by Spanish companies during Iberian times was much greater than that in Portuguese hands, the equipment should be split proportionally to that, giving the future Spanish military much more resources than the Portuguese one that way. On the other hand, the Portuguese team argues that this very reason, the disproportion of military industry, means Portugal should get more equipment than Spain, since Spain could quickly make up the difference once Iberia is no longer on the map.\n\nBoth teams have been arguing about this matter for days now and if the government wants to make sure Iberia is gone before the end of time, it seems like it must intervene and force a decision; since no team is willing to reach an agreement."
 IBR.1118.a:0 "Spain produced more of that equipment. It's theirs."
 IBR.1118.b:0 "Give more to Portugal - Spain can make up the deficit."
 IBR.1118.c:0 "Split it fairly, it's worth the time."
 
 IBR.1119.t:0 "Sharing The Academia General Militar Records"
 IBR.1119.d:0 "Before the military can be finally split and the Federal Armed Forces abolished and replaced by the separate forces of the two nations, the records of the Academia General Militar, the military academy in charge of overseeing the Federal Armed Forces training, must be distributed between the two countries. As with other things, some members of both negotiating teams want the records to be split freely, with each nation taking whatever it wants, but this solution isn't shared by most.\n\nSome members Spanish team argue that most, if not all, of the records have been written and administered by Spanish military personnel and as such the records should go to Spanish hands.The Portuguese team, on the other side, says that once the Union is not united anymore, the Portuguese military will be much weaker than the Spanish one for a variety of reasons; and having the records from the academy at hand would help Portugal get up to speed with other countries.\n\nIt seems like this argument will take forever if it keeps its current pace, so the government will step in to make a decision for both teams, even if it's just to make sure Iberia doesn't exist for more than it needs to."
 IBR.1119.a:0 "Deny the request - the records belong to Spain."
 IBR.1119.b:0 "Send them over - Portugal could use the experience."
 IBR.1119.c:0 "Share the records freely."

 IBR.2000.t:0 "The End Of Iberia"
 IBR.2000.d:0 "Everything was ready. The last trucks with military equipment were already on their way to Portugal, the embassies were ready to begin working, border passes were beginning to make as if Iberia was no more and the two national leaders were each in the capital of their respective countries. Due to legal procedures, Iberia could only be divided if both leaders signed a law that dealt with that. While the Spanish leader had already signed it, the Portuguese Caudillo had insisted on signing the law once he was back in Lisbon. The day had come. Today, from his office, the Portuguese leader would sign the law that would kill Iberia once and for all.\n\nSomewhere in Toledo, an old Portuguese woman prayed for her life because she wasn't able to move back to her country. In Porto, a Spanish man, husband and father of three children, was attending a special seminary on the new laws that he and his family would have to obey from now on. In Tetuán, the Iberian federal flag was taken down and the Spanish flag was hoisted while colonial troops trained, now only with a Spanish instructor.\n\nAnd at that precise moment, a moment that would get lost to time, the radios throughout the whole peninsula and all the territories that up until then were under Iberian rule broadcasted the same message. Some did it in Portuguese, others in Spanish; but the message was clear: Portugal had signed the break-up law. Iberia was now part of history."
 IBR.2000.a:0 "Hasta siempre viejo amigo."
 IBR.2000.b:0 "Até sempre velho amigo."

 
 #Cultural Events
 IBR.3000.t:0 "The National Animal?"
 IBR.3000.d:0 "Iberian unity has always been a rather dicey affair, especially in these turbulent times. While there are many who would use the instability to advance the cause of their own ethnic group, there are also plenty of loyal citizens who wish to keep our union intact. Artists, musicians, politicians, and even ordinary people have been known to come together to try and define a unified Iberian culture. Usually, these are mere blips on the radar, but sometimes something extraordinary comes from it, like the shared Conquistador pride, or the fact that both the Portuguese and Spanish have a hatred for Moors.\n\nAnd sometimes...these attempts end in disaster.\n\nIt all started off as a well meaning collaboration between the Lisbon and Madrid art guilds, in the hopes of producing a piece of art that symbolized the unity of Spain and Portugal. After some deliberation, the artists agreed that their project would consist of a giant mural displaying what they hoped to be "Iberia's new national animal". Taking the Spanish bull and the Portuguese rooster as pieces of inspiration, the artists slaved away day and night to create a masterpiece.\n\nUnfortunately, when it was finally unveiled before a crowd two weeks later, the reactions were less than stellar. The finished product, which for some reason ended up being a mixed up amalgamation of rooster and cow body parts with seven pairs of horns and at least three heads, immediately earned the ire of the entire nation that they were trying to appeal to. Described by onlookers variably as "an abomination", a "piece of vomit-inducing graffiti that wouldn't pass in an American art school", and "proof that Jesus died in vain".\n\nTo make matters worse, the "Iberian Chimera", as it has now been dubbed, was leaked to the international community, where in many countries it seems to have caught on immediately. Fortunately, in the grand scale of things this doesn't impact our nation too much, but the mental link between Iberia and the eldritch rooster-bull from hell in the minds of foreigners won't go away anytime soon."

 IBR.3001.d:0 "To: The Government of Iberia\nFrom: The Military Territory of Algeria\n\nThe loss of Caudillo Salazar is a tragedy. We will miss his steadfast protective nature of his people, I am sure. However, his death is exactly why I have seen fit to prepare and send this message to you. I have strong reason to believe that, with the death of one of the Caudillos, Iberia will shortly collapse. I am by no means wishing for this to happen, though the possibility of its occurrence is one I cannot deny. Were the Union to collapse, it would signal to the Italians and others that I am vulnerable, and without your protection this state would surely wither away.\n\nBecause of this, this letter has been prepared to notify you that our diplomatic relationship is henceforth null and void. In order to prevent an abrupt cessation of relations, we will instead terminate them now, in a prepared manner.\n\nAlgeria will fall under the sovereign leadership of Yves Godard. All Algerian territories under Iberian occupation will be seized and reincorporated into the Algerian state. All diplomatic ties with Iberia are formally severed."

The nearly complete skeleton has appeared to be that of a sauropod, with many scientists declaring it as a possible relative to the Brachiosaurus. Debates have already begun on what classification it belongs to, and many paleontologists are flooding the scene to try and find more clues of how and when the dinosaur lived. Their best guess so far is that this twenty-two ton behemoth lived during the Middle Jurassic and roamed all over the local area in large numbers.\n\nUpon hearing its description, one of the soldiers who found it stated that a large, useless, dumb lizard must be named after the infamous German project to drain the Mediterranean. The name Atlantropasaurus quickly caught on, and many citizens in Iberia have found interest in the dinosaur, including government officials. This specific specimen has even been ordered to be put on display in Madrid as a testament to Iberian strength and knowledge, and will arrive in less than a week."

It is past due that Iberia set its sights on the rest of the world, and the first step of this process will be the coastal city of Goa.\n\nFormerly a Portuguese colony, the port of Goa was seized by India shortly after the conclusion of the Second World War, near the turn of the decade, in tandem with the annexation of Angola and Mozambique by Germany. The garrison had already been substantially reduced, moved to the Portuguese colonies in Africa to defend them from German attacks. Reportedly, not a single shot was fired in defense or in assault of the port city, with the garrison simply surrendering and withdrawing from the port, allowing the Indian forces to move in and capture the colony entirely unopposed. The nature of the Goa Incident, however, raises quite a few doubts within the general staff, some of whom believe that there was more to the incident than the well-being of the troops.\n\nThere are two reasonable conclusions, according to our general staff: The attack was in whole Indian aggression, taking land which did not belong to them - and against such numbers, how could the already minimized garrison hope to resist them? After all, the garrison was outnumbered and under-equipped. Defeat at the hands of the superior Indian forces was inevitable. The second conclusion though carries far more ominous implications, that some unknown factor motivated the garrison commander to order our forces to stand down, surrendering our territories in Goa without so much as a protest."
 iberia.1.a:0 "The garrison commander is at fault here." 
 iberia.1.b:0 "India is clearly the culprit."

 iberia.2.t:0 "Interrogating the Garrison Commander"
 iberia.2.d:0 "Having had a small series of questions with Goa garrison commander Vassalo e Silva, we are now able to confirm... absolutely nothing. Our interrogation has proved entirely fruitless, having gotten little more than his insistence that he is not at fault, that Indian aggression was the root cause, and that he surrendered for the good of his men, despite repeated questioning. While he may simply be non-cooperative and attempting to hide something, it is still entirely possible that he really is innocent and India's aggression was fully to blame.\n\nThe question remains, who is more at fault?"
 iberia.2.a:0 "I don't think he's going to talk." 
 iberia.2.b:0 "If it wasn't the commander, then it was India."


 iberia.3.t:0 "Investigating Goa Documents"
 iberia.3.d:0 "Given the non-cooperative nature of Vassalo e Silva, we have been forced to follow a more complicated trail of information, and our agents have been forced to coast through an endless series of paperwork and reports, but at last they have discovered exactly what they were hunting for - reports, audits, and scores of other documents detailing just what exactly went on in that port. While the political reports appear, for the most part, normal, the financial audits are what we quickly came to have an interest in.\n\nWhile for a time the trends seemed reasonable, there appears to have been a gradual slippage of integrity culminating in an exceptionally large unexplained payment in mid November of 1961.."
 iberia.3.a:0 "I think there's something here." 

 iberia.4.t:0 "Goa Officials Bribed by the Indian Military"
 iberia.4.d:0 "Shocking news! Confirming our concerns, it would appear that unspecified payment was more than just a simple corruption scheme. According to our investigations, the payment can be traced back to several officials in the Indian army, and from there it isn't unreasonable to assume that the stand-down order was motivated by more than the well-being of the troops.\n\nNow we know, for certain, the guilt of Vassalo e Silva. Still, it is entirely possible this conspiracy reaches far deeper than we could expect, and more officials from Goa were involved in this plot than simply the garrison commander. What is our next course of action?"
 iberia.4.a:0 "We must reach the end of this." 
 iberia.4.b:0 "End the investigation and punish those involved."
 iberia.4.c:0 "The Indian Army you say?"

 iberia.5.t:0 "The Anjediva Trial"
 iberia.5.d:0 "Today Vassalo e Silva and his cadre of officials faced trial for allowing corruption to interfere with their duty of protecting Goa. This act was viewed as nothing short of treason by all present. Throughout the proceedings it was apparent on each defendant's face recognition of the consequences they would soon face; As the damned gazed about the courtroom, they found nothing but apathy for their fate. While the trials started with at least a facade of procedure, by the end of it the men behind the show-trials clearly wanted to just get it over with. The sentences were lenient - hard labor until the end of their days."
 iberia.5.a:0 "Very well."

 iberia.6.t:0 "Government Officials Involved in Goa Bribing"
 iberia.6.d:0 "It appears our little conspiracy goes deeper still. Having expanded the scope of their search, our agents have discovered a very intriguing set of documents. This paperwork reveals that several high officials in the Iberian government also took Indian money, using Vassalo e Silva as a sort of go-between. What will the investigation committee do with this damning evidence?"
 iberia.6.a:0 "Archive the case, NOW!" 
 
 iberia.7.t:0 "Case Archived"
 iberia.7.d:0 "Deep within the vast catacombs that make up the Iberian archives, a box full of files was deposited. While normally the labyrinthine nature of the archives is the scourge of any who work with it, today it was a boon. These documents had two layers of security against any prying eyes. First, they were within one of the most secure locations on the peninsula. Second, they were buried deep within, unlikely to ever see sunlight again. These audits will trouble Iberia no longer."
 iberia.7.a:0 "Make sure it's safe." 
 
 iberia.8.t:0 "The Press Discovers the Bribing"
 iberia.8.d:0 "Clearly the documents weren't as concealed as we thought. Somehow, the press managed to sneak out incriminating documents from the Iberian archives. The press, being the accursed vultures they are, seized on the opportunity for a good headline. Under our noses, the corruption scandal has spiraled out of control to the point where we have no chance of suppressing the news.\n\nMaking matters worse the officials involved have been utterly shamed by the public. While nobody lacks the sense to say such out loud, the attitude is certainly present at any public functions they make appearances at. We'll have to keep them out of the public eye for a time and let this all blow over."

 iberia.9.t:0 "Iberia Demands Compensation for the Goa Takeover"
 iberia.9.d:0 "Earlier today, the Iberian Union demanded of us we deliver to them compensation for their lost colony. They demand restitution, in full, for all the territories we "seized" from them when we recaptured the port of Goa by simply bribing the Iberian garrison to stand down. What makes this even more of a smack in the face is that they also sent their so-called estimates, inflating the value of Goa far above anything it could be reasonably priced at!\n\nThey are expecting a response by the end of the day. How are we going to respond to their ridiculous ultimatum?"
 iberia.9.a:0 "We won't pay a single rupee." 
 iberia.9.b:0 "Perhaps we can find common ground?"
 
 iberia.10.t:0 "India Refuses to Pay"
 iberia.10.d:0 "What insolence! India has refused to compensate their aggression, claiming it was not really aggression. Effectively we have lost every last escudo Portugal has placed into the port. Clearly the only option remaining is to remind them the consequences of flippantly rejecting our offer to resolve the problem peacefully. Although perhaps we may be yet able to strike a deal...\n\nRegardless, we must compose a response post-haste, as we simply cannot allow such a response to go unanswered. What will it be?"
 iberia.10.a:0 "The Goa takeover is an act of war, so be careful." 
 iberia.10.b:0 "How about a symbolic payment?" 
 
 iberia.11.t:0 "Iberia Blackmails us!"
 iberia.11.d:0 "Iberia is back at it again hounding us over Goa. At least this time they had the decency to change their tactics. This time they've informed us they hold compromising information over some of our officers, of which they also threaten to give out. What "give out" means we're not sure. Regardless, they at least had the decency to demand a smaller payment. We can refuse, obviously. However, perhaps we should give them a reduced payment. Of course, they never specified what they meant by reduced, only less than the initial price..."
 iberia.11.a:0 "We'll pay, but not full price." 
 iberia.11.b:0 "We said no." 
 
 iberia.12.t:0 "Iberia Proposes a Symbolic Payment"
 iberia.12.d:0 "Rather than endlessly hound us over payment, Iberia has proposed a far better idea. They have proposed a sort of symbolic payment instead of the original sum. A trinket or something of the sort, it is argued to us, would suffice just as well as a payment. It would be far easier to acquire the resources required for a move like this, but all of this assumes we have to tolerate this hounding at all. Will we go through with a symbolic payment?"
 iberia.12.a:0 "Symbolic. That's it."
 iberia.12.b:0 "What part of no you don't understand?" 
 
 iberia.13.t:0 "A Laughable Check"
 iberia.13.d:0 "The sheer insolence! It baffles a man! India claimed to have folded to our blackmail demands and sent to us a check for the port of Goa. The illusion disintegrated once we received the check, which totaled one rupee! They refuse to pay us any further, claiming that they paid the reduced sum. Goa is lost, and now so is all of our investment into the port city. This whole situation could have been avoided if we had just specified a minimum..."
 iberia.13.a:0 "They played us like a damn fiddle!" 
 
 iberia.14.t:0 "India Stands its Ground"
 iberia.14.d:0 "India insists it will not provide us any compensation for the port of Goa. Given our position we are lack the ability to do anything else about it. If blackmail didn't work, nothing will. Our plans have failed. Our port is lost. Worst of all, our investments are also lost.\n\nThe only thing we can do now is swallow our pride and admit defeat. We need to salvage what we can and bury these negotiations. If we can't, then our government will be rendered laughingstocks in the eyes of the public once more. "
 iberia.14.a:0 "Archive this before the press gets a hold on it." 
 
 iberia.15.t:0 "Another Folder in the Archives"
 iberia.15.d:0 "Initially, the plan was to place the failed Goa negotiations near the corruption scandal. After a moment's reflection, however.. It was quickly decided these documents needed to be somewhere deeper. Somewhere even more hidden. The negotiations were taken deep into the archives, into a place more dust than paperwork. Here was stored some of the most absurd of the incidents Iberia has had to deal with in its lifetime. While the Goa negotiations were certainly not absurd they needed to be buried. There was an open slot, coincidentally between several other diplomatic arrangements, and this slot is where the negotiations were stowed away. And so they were left, to be forgotten to the forces of time."

Even though we managed to suppress the media from truly capitalizing on our gaffe, the damage has already been done. For the short term our government has humiliated in the face of the public. Thankfully, our agents stopped the press before they were able to showcase our more under-the-table dealings. If they had publicized those we would never hear the end of it.\n\nFor the time being our best action is to ride this one out.

The whole event concluded with the formal hand-off, a ceremonial changing of the guard from Iberian to Indian.\n\nDespite the expenses, the formal ceremony for the handover of Goa went off without a hitch. Thanks to the ability of our diplomats we have managed to hammer out a very robust deal.

 iberia.19.d:0 "India has stated to us that they firmly will not pay our requested sum. They were quick to explain, however, that they are willing to pay. Rather than a deposit of rupees they expressed interest in an alternative form of payment. They wish to present us with an option that equals the value of our desired compensation, and that we will find it a compelling deal. While it's entirely possible there will indeed be a compelling deal, we are entirely in our rights to demand currency alone. How will we respond?"

Even though we don't have something picked out for certain, we have several options that will surely make up the value of any payment to Iberia.\n\nWe have several options that they may find enticing. Firstly, we could grant them special economic rights in the port of Goa. These business rights would allow Iberia to easily make up their claimed difference, without us doing a thing. Secondly, we could propose an equal investment of sorts. Finally, we could make them an unorthodox offer: Prisoners.

With no warning whatsoever an entire army had shown up, and in the face of such odds the garrison was ordered to stand down. They were all escorted to a prison, and treated like the prisoners they now apparently were.\n\nOver the next few days, the soldier began planning his escape.His plan was simple, slip from the eyes of the guards and glide away to somewhere else. Perhaps by fortune, this plan worked out and soon he found himself out of his confinement. Then came the next part of the plan: He ran. He kept running until his lungs failed him and he could move no longer, and he repeated the process until he was far, far away from Goa. What struck him as odd was how little of a chase was given, but he was too busy fleeing the vicinity to properly dwell on it.\n\nHe was making his way to Bombay, where he had heard there were a lot of British people.

We'll delay the proceedings until Iberia gets disinterested and drops the negotiations. Secondly, formally prisoners of war are under Japan's discretion. While we don't usually follow that rule we could definitely follow it here, and refer the Iberians to Japan. That should get them off our backs, at least for a while.

Since the return of prisoners is a major issue, we may still want to pay the cost for them, regardless of how extortionate. Alternatively we could take the best of both worlds.

Predictably, most of it is to go to transportation, since crossing half the world is never cheap. As corruption isn't entirely defeatable, a small sum must go as a backup to ensure there's enough payment to cover the transportation. Finally, we have taken the liberty of preparing a grand sendoff ceremony, as they deserve.\n\nThe Iberian reaction was less-than-enthused at the breakdown of payment, but since the money had already been sent there was nothing they could do.

Then, to the offense of human decency, were used as human labor for menial projects. Because of the total mistreatment of the government, they died, alone, far away from home, and were never to see their families again.\n\nSadly, there was no proper explanation for the mistreatment, other than sheer cruelty.

We have been redirected to from our client state because, allegedly, we control their prisoner management.\n\nIgnoring that this isn't true, for the sake of maintaining an honorable reputation they'll need to be given a response.

Our imprisoned brethren would be under strict supervision, and were not to be released. When pressed for a justification, cost was cited. When we offered to pay, we were flatly declined.

There's no reason to change our ruling on their prisoners - after all, no means no.

 ##Santa Maria Affair##
 
 iberia.300.t:0 "Captain Galvão Speaks Out Against the Caudillos"
 iberia.300.d:0 "This morning, shocking news reached the offices of the Caudillos. Upon the front pages of national newspapers was a breaking column. Captain Galvão, a prominent naval officer with the command of a significant vessel in the Iberian fleet, has gone public to national media to speak out against the Caudillos. In this media statement, the Captain goes on at length to discuss what he perceives as continual oppression from the Caudillos, the noticeable loss of freedoms across Iberia, and mismanagement of the armed forces. Due to the status of this high ranking military officer, and the power he holds, the nation has gone into a frenzy over this breaking news. One can scarcely appear in public without hearing talk of this breaking headline.\n\nStrict rules are placed upon all members of the Iberian military, forbidding them to give opinions to the media without strict approval and guidance from public relations personnel or superior officers. Due to this, the testimony that Captain Galvão gave to the media could see him immediately tried by court martial resulting in a dishonorable discharge. To commence such proceedings we would need to speak to his direct superior officer. However, Captain Galvão's statement appears to be rather popular at this moment, and immediately silencing him might be seen by the public as a move of suppression, furthering this crisis. Letting the issue fester, however, is also far from ideal for the public image of the Caudillos."

 iberia.301.t:0 "Commanding Officer Supports Galvão"
 iberia.301.d:0 "Since Captain Galvão recently went public with his dissent against the Caudillos, the Caudillos have sent a joint request to his direct superior, a Rear Admiral in the Iberian Navy, to begin to undertake the necessary measures to court martial Captain Galvão for his unapproved and inflammatory comments upon the Caudillos. The reply from his superior officer, which arrived to the office of the Caudillos in a letter, is far from the compliance that was expected.\n\n"Caudillos Franco and Salazar,\nIt has come to my attention that the government seeks disciplinary action upon my loyal subordinate, Captain Galvão, for his comments which have notably upset the Caudillos. I wish to dispel any notions that the Captain acts independently and without approval.\nAs the direct superior of Captain Galvão, I can attest that these statements given to Iberian media were not the sole opinions of one individual. I can further attest that, due to my approval of these statements, I do not find Captain Galvão in direct breach of any media outreach policies, and as such, I shall not be seeking disciplinary action against him.\n\nSincerely,\nContra Almirante Valerio""

 iberia.302.d:0 "Following the defiance towards the Caudillos displayed by significant contingents of the naval high command, Caudillo Salazar has proceeded with his plans of extinguishing dissent within the naval high command, beginning with Captain Galvão and those who support him in his campaign of public outcry. Those apprehended in the purge of the Naval forces are to face immediate courts martial in Madrid. Those not facing direct charges within the naval forces are to be closely audited, as we search for any other possible dissidents within the ranks of the Iberian Naval high command.\n\nRear Admiral Valerio, the superior officer of Captain Galvão who defied orders from the Caudillos, was today among the first apprehended in the first wave of these purges. Captain Galvão himself however, whose name now carries significant weight within Iberia, has escaped apprehension. His current whereabouts are unknown. Some speculate that he has fled to South America, while others claim that he may have fled to a hostile nation in search of amnesty and possibly even support.\n\nWhilst the current scope of those affected by the purges is limited, and mostly surrounds those who have supported Captain Galvão, they have only just begun. The expectation rests that following the purges, the loyalty of the navy shall be unquestionable."

 iberia.303.d:0 "Franco and Salazar sit in a secluded briefing room, accompanied by admirals and colonels of the Iberian navy. The mood within is grim, as an Admiral begins the briefing.\n\n"Caudillos, three days ago at 1100 hours, an Iberian passenger ship known as the Santa Maria departed from port in Caracas. Within two hours of her departure, contact was temporarily lost. Today at 1400 hours, we have received a communique from the West Indies Federation, detailing their discoveries surrounding the vessel. This morning, the Santa Maria temporarily docked in Saint Lucia, offloading four injured crewmen for medical attention, before quickly departing once again. As the crewmen spoke only Portuguese, it was not until after the departure of the Santa Maria that local authorities could appropriately discern the situation onboard. Caudillos, the Santa Maria and her nine-hundred occupants, including American and other foreign nationals, are currently held hostage by approximately two dozen pro-democracy terrorists. The leader of the terrorists is said to be Henrique Galvão, however we are currently attempting to confirm these claims. A civilian maritime advisory has already been issued, however our naval forces are not ready to conduct a Caribbean search."\n\nThe room descends into an eerie silence as the Caudillos absorb the gravity of the situation. Quickly, Franco chimes in. "If there are Americans being held hostage by these terrorists, we must contact the American government immediately! They will not stand for this!" exclaims Franco.\n\n"No! We should not draw attention to these terrorists. Galvão has received enough attention for his treasonous actions. He should not receive any further recognition." Salazar retorts. The two descend into a fiery argument as the rest of the room awkwardly looks on."

 iberia.304.t:0 "Americans on a Hijacked Iberian Ship"
 iberia.304.d:0 "Today, news reached the offices of the Pentagon of a crisis upon the seas. The Iberian Government as well as the West Indies Federation report of a hijacked passenger ship, known as the Santa Maria. The ship was days ago hijacked by a group of radical Iberian democrats who boarded disguised as passengers, and has since gone off the radar following a quick stop in Saint Kitts, in which crewmen injured in the hijacking were offloaded. Aboard the ship are six-hundred passengers, consisting of women, children, and civilian men. Many of those aboard the ship are Iberian, however the Pentagon confirms that several occupants are American citizens.\n\nIt is possible that all those aboard the ship could meet a violent end, should all go awry, which would include the death of several American citizens at the hands of foreign terrorists. The American public would find such news unacceptable. As such, the only advisable course of action would be to commence a naval search operation to find the Santa Maria, and to liberate those on board. There are several United States Navy vessels in the Caribbean and central-atlantic region, which are prepared to commence search operations upon a moment's notice."

 iberia.305.d:0 "Corporal Smithley is the last in his squad to climb aboard the Santa Maria under the cover of nightfall. He carefully unslings his M14 rifle from his back, and as quietly as possible does a check of his loaded magazine, ensuring a round is readily prepared within the chamber. The intent of the mission is clear. Act fast, ensure civilians are not harmed, and take prisoner as many of the hijackers as possible. As soon as the first shot is fired, the hijackers will mobilize.\n\nThe squad leader gives a short series of hand signals, and they begin to move slowly across the dimly lit deck of the ship.\n\nNot long after, contact is made. The squad leader quickly releases two shots into the armed hijacker patrolling the deck, and the hijacker goes limp. Now that shots have been fired, the marines spring into action. Shots ring out from the other side of the deck, as other hijackers are likely killed. Smithley accompanies his squad in climbing an outer staircase of the ship, as they prepare for close quarters combat upon entering the bridge. The order is given to fix bayonets, and Smithley quickly affixes the ringed bayonet to the socket upon the barrel. Commotion can now be heard from within the ship, as several men begin shouting. Gunshots can be heard from other areas of the ship, as other marine squads quickly dispatch the oddly placed and unprepared hijackers.\n\nSmithley's squad quickly arrives at the entrance to the bridge, from where the ship is controlled. The squad leader begins counting down the entry. Finally, the count hits one, and he springs into action along with the rest of his squad. Quickly, they rush in to the bridge. Smithley, without thinking, dispatches one armed defender before a shot is fired. The other armed men within the bridge drop their rifles, and swiftly surrender to preserve their own life."

 iberia.306.t:0 "The Americans Capture Galvão"
 iberia.306.d:0 "Reports have today arrived from the United States Navy that the Santa Maria has been secured. A contingent of United States Marines aboard the USS Hermitage were able to successfully board the Santa Maria in the dark early hours of the morning. Seven hijackers were killed, and no civilians or crewmen who were hostages upon the ship were harmed. The other seventeen hijackers were captured by the United States Navy, and placed under custody. Among those captured is Henrique Galvão, who surrendered himself to marine forces once they swiftly stormed the bridge of the ship.\n\nThe United States has already agreed to extradite the Iberian hijackers to us, to be dealt with by our legal system. The Americans, after questioning Galvão, have alerted us of his intentions. The intent of the hijacking was to sail the ship to Portugal, where he intended to incite rebellion within Iberia. Should he have succeeded, he could have proven a true thorn in our side. Our concerns are not dispelled, however. While this one pro-democracy rebel is now in our custody, he did not act alone. There are others within Iberia who would risk their lives to fight for a democratic cause."

 iberia.307.t:0 "Hijackers Broadcast Speech from Cuba"
 iberia.307.d:0 "From Cuba, a radio broadcast emits. One which the Iberians had never expected nor hoped to hear. Radios across the world crackle to life with the voice of Henrique Galvão, who has recently eluded our capture. He now broadcasts a radio address from Cuba, where he and his hijackers of the Santa Maria have been granted refuge.\n\nGalvão's broadcast much resembles the inflammatory media statements he gave when he was a Captain in the Iberian Navy. This speech, however, is far more radical. Calling for democracy in Iberia, Galvão encourages the Iberian people to take up arms and to oppose the regime of the Caudillos in any way they can. He claims that any Iberian man or woman can make large strides to remove the Caudillos from office, and that should they wish for a brighter future, they should act radically.\n\nWhilst this speech was little more than revolutionary rubbish, many of our people are abuzz with inspiration from the vile broadcast. The Iberian media has been ordered not to cover the incident in any capacity, however around the globe newspapers are choked full of editorials and articles upon the supposed "Iberian democratic movements". This is a wound that we cannot mask."

 iberia.308.d:0 "A flood of occupants begin to offload from a large passenger ship, as the media and an emotional populace surround the arriving vessel. After several weeks of tension and uncertainty, the hostages of the Santa Maria have returned to Iberia. Although internationally considered to be a terrorist, Henrique Galvão and his band of hijackers did not kill any on board the Santa Maria during the seizure of the ship. Following their refuge in Cuba, the Cuban government agreed to provide transportation back to Iberia for the approximate 900 hostages of the vessel.\n\nA wave of teary-eyed friends and family rush forth to meet the disembarking crowd, as the cameras of the media flash in the backdrop. Many among the country feared that many, and even perhaps all, of the hostages would never return to Iberian shores. Contrary to concerns, however, all hostages have now been accounted for. As not all hostages were Iberian citizens, preparations are currently underway to ensure the swift return of foreign nationals to their home countries.\n\nWhilst this represents a major humiliation to Iberia upon the world stage, many count their blessings as their loved ones return home safely from a frightening voyage."

 iberia.309.t:0 "Salazar Pushes Involvement in South African War"
 iberia.309.d:0 "Within the high governmental offices in Madrid, yet another disagreement erupts between the Caudillos. Following the outbreak of the South African War, the German and American spheres have thrown their weight behind the factions of the Boer Republic and the Dominion of South Africa, respectively. As the conflict drags on, concerns within Iberia grow that the German backed African powers may soon overrun the Dominion of South Africa, creating a dominance of the German sphere within Central to South Africa. The United States has grown increasingly involved in the conflict, with a growing American force being committed to the South African War to prop up the Dominion government.\n\nSalazar argues to an unconvinced Franco that the Iberian nation would benefit greatly through intervention in South Africa. While the front lines of this conflict are far from home, assistance to the Dominion of South Africa against the Germans and the Boers could provide a barrier to the further expansion of German influence within the African continent. Furthermore, Salazar argues that within a continent rife with the rise of new nations, significant favor and influence over a well established state such as South Africa could prove an essential strategic stepping stone in the expansion and maintenance of Iberian influence globally.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to come to the formal agreement required for any official action to take place, Salazar is unrelenting in his proposals, believing firmly in the necessity of Iberian intervention in South Africa. If either of the Caudillos is to be moved in his opinion, it is likely not to be Salazar."

Following the American intervention in the Santa Maria affair, where United States Marines secured the terrorist leader Henrique Galvão as well as ensuring the safety of nine hundred hostages, Franco feels indebted to the Americans. He agrees with Salazar that the Americans deserve steadfast support in their South African interventionism, and that Iberia should do all in its capacity to ensure that they do not stand alone in combating German influence in Africa.\n\nThe Caudillos immediately prepare the necessary measures to commence the planning of operations. Franco swiftly arranges for emergent meetings with the military high command, as Salazar calls for arrangements to be made with the Foreign Ministry to begin diplomatic engagements with the Americans and South Africans concerning the war.

While suspicious of Salazar's seemingly unending zeal to intervene in South Africa, Franco reluctantly agrees with Salazar of the benefits of a successful Iberian intervention in the South African conflict. Franco, however, is uncertain of Salazar's convictions that Iberia should become a near equal partner to the United States in the conflict. While he believes in the strategic value of the conflict, he does not share the same unending confidence as his counterpart.\n\nThe Caudillos immediately prepare the necessary measures to commence the planning of operations.

 iberia.312.d:0 "This afternoon, the Iberian ambassador in Washington D.C. met with the President. The Iberian ambassador, in a move that has shocked many in our administration, has pledged the direct support of Iberia in the South African War. The ambassador claimed that, should the United States accept the offer of Iberian support in the conflict, Iberia is prepared to contribute significant and direct military combat support.\n\nAlthough wholly unexpected, this news has been welcomed by many in Washington. Previously, many Americans felt alienated within the conflict. It has been widely viewed as if we were standing alone. While the scale of Iberian support has yet to be confirmed, we have affirmed with the Iberian ambassador that we will accept their support without question. Furthermore, our military is poised to provide any aid possible to the Iberians in assisting with the commencement of their operations."

The Americans have, quite jubilantly, accepted our offer of support in South Africa, and will welcome our forces in addition to theirs in the conflict. In further support of our efforts, the Americans have pledged extensive logistical assistance to commence our operations in the region, to ensure a smooth operational launch.\n\nSalazar has proven to be quite elated following this news. Already, thousands of Portuguese soldiers are poised for deployment to South Africa, as thousands more conduct additional training to prepare for near-future deployments. Many in the public remain skeptical, however, of the significance of such a conflict. People question why Iberian men must be sent to perish in a conflict thousands of miles away, over a country with no true ties to Iberia. Regardless of skepticism, Salazar has the Portuguese war machine mobilizing as much as feasible, as the countdown to Iberian operations in South Africa begins."

While our contributions pale in comparison to the immense military investments sent forth by the United States, our efforts were nonetheless significant and fruitful. Following such efforts, Salazar stands firm in his belief that Iberia has earned a significant award for her efforts. More specifically, he states, he believes that Iberia has earned back her former Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n\nWhilst the return of the Portuguese colonies is a favourable fantasy for Salazar, reality is often disappointing. For Iberia to seize these lands for herself once again would likely act counter to the interests of nearly all powers in the region. While we may put forth the argument that we have amply paid for this return in blood, it remains highly uncertain whether the Americans will see things the same way. Regardless, Salazar stands firm that we must toss the dice, and formally request that the Americans permit the return of Iberian rule to former Portuguese colonial possessions."

Their sizeable contributions significantly aided in creating the conditions for victory over the Boers and the German sphere. The Iberians themselves are very well aware of this fact, and are thus attempting to leverage it to their best advantage.\n\nRecently, a signed letter from Caudillo Salazar, the Portuguese co-dictator of Iberia, arrived for the Predident. The nature of the letter, if one could get around the complexities of diplomatic writing, was a candid request. Salazar expresses to us that, following the significant Iberian contributions in South Africa, Iberia formally requests from the United States that Iberia be allowed to re-occupy her former Portuguese colonies, seized by the Germans in prior decades.\n\nWhilst we understand the Iberian desire to reclaim her former territories following a hard fought conflict, it would be near impossible to retain a positive moral image should we accept. Our public image was one of fighting for freedom and against German imperialism and aggression in the region. Should we allow Iberia her spoils of war, it would merely appear as replacing one colonial dictatorship with another. The Iberians will not be pleased to be denied, however for our own sake, we have but one choice."

In short, the United States has formally denied our request for the official return of Iberian governorship over the former Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola.\n\nThe President, in his reply, states: "The United States of America cannot, in good faith, guarantee to Iberia the return of any former colonial or other overseas territories and possessions. It was our goal in this costly war to combat the colonial sphere of an imperial oppressor, and to guarantee the self determination of the peoples of South Africa. With this, we believe the Iberian request to be contrary to this goal."\n\nSalazar, in a fury, has gone on at length in private of what he perceives as an American betrayal, claiming that the United States has denied Iberia a claim in the spoils of war. He continues on in saying that the Americans bled the Iberians for their own benefit, and that Iberia will never forget this betrayal.

As a result, once the war concluded and many of the soldiers were free from their contractual obligations to the military, several thousand Portuguese soldiers opted to settle down in South Africa, calling the country their new home, much like the Dutch and British settlers of old.\n\nWhilst these Portuguese settlers had no official status within South Africa, the South African government has recently announced a change to this status. All Portuguese individuals currently residing within South Africa, as a thanks for the immense volume of Portuguese soldiers who fought for them, have been granted official permanent residency status within South Africa. As such, the thousands of Portuguese expats may now legally pursue a largely unrestricted private life.\n\nThis move acts largely as a thanks from the South African government to the brave Portuguese men who put their lives at risk for the continued existence of the South African nation, and as a gesture towards the many who fell in the conflict."

Few have taken better to this life better, however, than a former Iberian Army Corporal named Fernando Duarte.\n\nFernando was always regarded among his peers as a good cook, who would never fail to create a genuine good meal from simple ingredients. He utilized this talent within his new life in South Africa by opening a restaurant in Johannesburg. This restaurant, focused upon home-style cooking and flavourful chicken, has seen wild success, capturing the love and craze of the South African people.\n\nThe wild success of his first restaurant inspired Fernando to open another, and yet another, as thousands packed through the doors of his restaurant to have a taste of the famed Portuguese cooking. The restaurant, known as "Nandos", now boasts five restaurants already in its short existence. One having recently opened in Portugal, Fernando's native country, and four in South Africa, with several more likely coming in the years ahead. As Nandos continues to spread like wildfire, it has become a true success story of South African-Iberian cooperation."

Portuguese, American, and South African soldiers lay dead upon their rifles, their lives extinguished by the advance of the German sphere. The war in South Africa is lost. Just as lost as the lives of those men who lay dead in the streets of Cape Town.\n\nFollowing an expensive and strenuous effort by both the United States and Iberia to prop up the nation of South Africa against the overwhelming forces of the Afrika Schild, the adversity was one that could not be sufficiently overcome. As thousands of brave Portuguese volunteers were sent forth to die in a foreign land, the forces of the Schild continued to press ever farther south, until it was realized by all that this war was one that could not be won. The evacuation of South Africa was swift, with the United States undertaking a large effort to evacuate high value personnel from Cape Town. Tens of thousands of military men boarded ships and aircraft to retreat back home in the final weeks of the South African nation.\n\nAcross Iberia, the defeat in South Africa is seen as an irresponsible military disaster and a humiliation by nearly all, to the point that even Caudillo Franco has noticeably distanced himself from the South African intervention, all too glad to allow Salazar to receive the majority of the backlash for the intervention that was initially proposed by him."

What is widely known as "White psy-ops" is seen in virtually every theater of war, with the distribution of state-approved propaganda such as newspapers, posters, and leaflets among foreign populations and military ranks. What is lesser known, however, is what is known as "Black psy-ops".\n\nThroughout the South African War, Iberian psychological warfare units have conducted black psychological operations in an attempt to dissuade, demoralize, and convince enemy forces and populations. These initial operations have seen some limited success, however in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States, they hope to expand the scope of their black psy-ops.\n\nThe Americans have been proven to be rather brutal yet effective in securing a stronger hold over South African territory. In conjunction with the South African government and Iberian psychological operations units, an operation has been undertaken known as the "Phoenix Program". This operation aims to conduct a covert psychological operation upon those in South Africa who may possibly lean to support the Schild or the Boers. Through exposure, public himiliation, arrest, and even torture, the CIA and Iberians conduct a campaign of terror among the civilian populace who lean in support of the enemy, aiming to neutralize the membership of hostile organizations.

Civilians in South Africa find themselves inadvertently caught in the crossfire of this bloody conflict, and as a result, many become a casualty of war.\n\nIn the chaos of the city streets, many speak of Portuguese saviours who run through the deadly corridors, rescuing those in need. These stories, while they may appear to be fantastical, are in fact grounded in reality.\n\nAccounts from across the conflict in South Africa tell of Portuguese medics of the Iberian army coming to the aid of those in peril, risking their own life and limb to do so. Hundreds of South Africans claim to have been in some way rescued by these medics, operating far outside the scope of their mission in order to provide any assistance possible for the South African populace caught in zones of conflict. The actions of these men have truly become the make of legend."

 iberia.322.t:0 "Iberia Offers to Lease São Tomé" #US ONLY EVENT
 iberia.322.d:0 "As the war in South Africa continues to ramp up, so does the involvement of our Iberian partners. The Iberians, much to our pleasure, have stood behind their commitments within the conflict, and have continued to provide much coveted support for our forces as well as those of our allies. In a recent communication, the Iberians have pledged a significant expansion to their existing support within the war. The communication to Washington D.C. outlines many intricacies and details of current Iberian intentions within the conflict, however one pledge within the document stands out from the others.\n\nThe Iberian island of São Tome, which rests just north of the Equator, not far off the coasts of Central and West Africa, carries great potential as a logistics hub for the duration of this conflict. Following the establishment of Iberian operations in South Africa, they now believe the situation to be appropriate to lease access to the island to us, granting us an invaluable logistical asset. Senior military officials believe that the ports of São Tome may be effectively used as a logistics waypoint, and further as a possible airbase for our bomber aircraft fleet.\n\nWhilst plans for the usage of the island remain in the preliminary stages, we have gratefully accepted the Iberian lease proposal, and it is estimated that logistical operations upon the island will commence in a matter of mere months."

 iberia.323.t:0 "Stalemate in South Africa"
 iberia.323.d:0 "As the hills of South Africa grow scarred with the damages of war, and the great pastures become choked with the corpses of young men, no victor can be determined. When once, one might say the Boers had the upper hand, and at other times people may have talked of an impending American victory, no such talk takes place any longer. The war is not lost, yet neither has it been won.\n\nAs thousands of Iberian, primarily Portuguese, men now lay dead in South Africa, thousands more back home mourn for their losses in a conflict far overseas, in a land no more relevant to them than the shores of Alaska. In the grievance of their insurmountable loss, many have begun to question the war, and the motives behind Iberian involvement. The people look to Salazar for answers, yet he has none to provide for them.\n\nWhen once Salazar would have spoken at length of a restoration of Iberian glory and an Iberian resurgence upon the world stage, now he says nothing. Salazar knows the war is by no means a success, and the fervor he once held for the Iberian intervention has been all but extinguished, as has all hope of victory."

 iberia.324.t:0 "Iberia Provides Maps for War Effort"
 iberia.324.d:0 "While Portuguese colonial administration over Mozambique and Angola is a thing of the past, naught more than a mention within the history books, the recency of this history now has the potential to pay dividends within the war effort.\n\nIn a recent coordination effort, hosted in Washington, senior members of the Iberian military provided to us a plethora of dated maps and documentation, hailing from the late era of Portuguese colonial control in Mozambique and Angola. The content of the documents provided details, at great length, upon the industrial and infrastructural specifications in various vital regions within Mozambique and Angola, now controlled by the Reichskommissariats of the Afrika Schild. We estimate that the maps, while outdated, are likely to this day accurate to a high degree. The information provided by the Iberians should prove invaluable for the continued effectiveness of the American bombing campaign against our enemies, as we begin to accurately strike at vital enemy logistical and industrial centers."
 iberia.324.a:0 "May the bombs rain down even more accurately than before."
 
 iberia.325.t:0 "US Airforce Hits Luanda Arms Factories" #event for IBR and USA
 iberia.325.d:0 "Following an exchange of information between the Iberian and American militaries, the USAF has been in possession of detailed information upon the logistical and industrial layout of the Afrika Schild controlled regions of Mozambique and Angola. The intelligence has not been left to waste.\n\nYesterday afternoon, USAF bombers struck at industrial centers within Luanda, where significant arms production has been undertaken for the duration of the conflict in South Africa. Due to information provided by Iberian intelligence, American bombs were able to fall with deadly accuracy upon essential edifices within the local industry, causing irreparable damages and bringing a significant share of arms production in the region to a complete halt.\n\nDue to the quick and devastating nature of the new American bombing campaign, it is hoped by many senior officials that the productive capabilities of the Reichskommissariats will be significantly hindered for the duration of the conflict. Despite this, the overall effect of the reinvigorated American bombing campaign upon the overall effectiveness of the Afrika Schild has yet to be determined."
 iberia.325.a:0 "A significant blow to the enemy war machine."

 POLITICS_FRANCISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "While internationally a divisive figure, it cannot be denied that Caudillo Francisco Franco clawed his way to his position through merit. With the German victory in WW2, António de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal approached Franco to create a protective union against the Germans. Spain found itself uniting with Portugal in a comprehensive defence-pact-turned nation.\n\nBut of course, that was the past. In the last decade, Franco has been witness to insurmountable calamities. The disaster of the Atlantropa project destroyed the economy, and Germany going into utter freefall obliterated what little remained. His erstwhile allies in the Triumvirate are at each other's throats, ready to drop all pretence of unity over the slightest dispute. The colonization of Algeria in the 1950s, considered a proud accomplishment, has revealed itself as a double-edged sword that has dragged his nation into constant conflict with Italy. Salazar's unfounded notions of a non-existent "Law of Succession", that would see Portugal absorbed into Spain under the reinstated Spanish monarchy after both Caudillos had died, has raised questions about the future of Iberia under Franco. An attempted coup by old shirt Falangists was only just stopped through their removal from power by Franco.\n\nIberia, once proud, has fallen on hard times, and even the Caudillo himself has begun to doubt their ability to stay unified, though he'd never admit this to anybody. He can see the writing on the wall, and deep down he feels that it's only a matter of time before all that he's worked for comes crashing down around him."

 POLITICS_ANTONIO_DE_OLIVEIRA_SALAZAR_IBERIA_DESC:0 "It would be quite unfair to dismiss Antonio de Olivera Salazar, the leader of Portugal since 1932, as merely an obstructive bureaucrat. Coming to power in Portugal a few years before Franco gained control of Spain, Salazar was a political power player in his own right. Only under the pressure of German troops seizing Angola and Mozambique did he decide to accept a deal with his own personal devil. When Franco approached Salazar to create a defensive-pact-turned-nation, he accepted, merging Portugal with the similarly right-wing nation of Spain. Now the Iberian Union, the two countries would work together in harmony... at least in theory.\n\nIn actuality, however, this could not be further from the truth. Salazar was not concerned with the welfare of the Union so much as the welfare of Portugal. Wielding a desire to protect his nation from anything that might harm her in the one hand, and an almost pathological obsession with vetoing proposals that would solidify the Union further in the other, Salazar quickly gained a reputation in the Council for being obstructive. His paranoia concerning "Spanish oppression of Portugal" led to many a confrontation with Franco himself, who saw him as one of many reasons why Iberia was likely to fall apart. With Franco's attempted passing of the "Law of Succession", meaning Portugal's absorption into Spain through the reinstallation of the monarchy after the deaths of the Caudillos, the divide between the two was firmly set. This was despite Salazar removing old shirt falangist elements who had attempted to stage a coup against the Union."

With factions and traitors all around him Franco held onto what he had helped build. After all, did the federal government not have the real legitimate authority over Iberia?"

 POLITICS_MANUEL_FRAGA_DESC:0 "To some, Manuel Fraga Iribarne is the champion of the new democratic Iberia, a firm and fair leader who can keep the country from falling apart in the aftermath of the transition to democracy. To others, Fraga is just another Falangist, a holdover from the old regime whose project is to retain the economic and political legacy of the dictatorship while giving the same old authoritarianism a new, modern sheen. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. \n\nA lawyer by trade, Fraga's involvement in politics goes back to the 1950's, when he held various minor posts in the regime of the Caudillos. His big break came when he was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism, where he earned a name for himself by revitalizing the Iberian tourism industry, leading a campaign under the slogan "Iberia is different!" In the 60's Fraga also earned an unsavory reputation for his role as a propagandist for the regime, publicly justifying the execution of political prisoners such as Julian Grimau. Despite his complicity in the worst abuses of the Caudillos, Fraga became a part of a reformist faction within the regime, seeking to move Iberia in the direction of democracy. When the rule of the Caudillos ended, he formed the Alianza Popular, an alliance of various smaller parties led by former reformist ministers in the old regime. \n\nElected to a majority in Iberia's first democratic elections, Fraga and the Alianza Popular now seek to strike a balance between reform and order, bringing Iberia into the 20th century and doing away with the old institutions while also keeping the country together against the forces of political extremism and separatism."

With President Valcarcel's failed attempt to destroy the Iberian Council and re-establish a dictatorial regime, Fraga was forced to band together with the other democratic parties in what is now known as the Democratic Salvation Coalition. Thrust into the position of President, he must now keep the unruly transitional coalition alive long enough to deal with the Unión Nacional and ensure the continuation of Iberian democracy."
 
 POLITICS_ALBERTO_ULLASTRES_DESC:0 "Ullastres Calvo was born on the eve of only the first of the many unfathomable catastrophes that seized the reins of the 20th century. He dedicated his early years in Madrid to attaining a strong education, graduating first in Law and Commerce and later obtaining his doctorate. Initially working as professor for Political Economy he soon found his way into serving for the newly established Iberian administration. His economic knowledge was greatly needed as the Union took a harsh economic hit from the 1950s German Financial Crash and the animosity between the Unity Pakt and the Triumvirate.\n\nQuickly working his way up the civil service ladder he was soon screened for ministerial positions. Reservations about his revealed close connections to the highly religious order Opus Dei remained but Ullastres managed to finally serve as trade minister for the Union. The longer he served however the more disillusioned he became with the current direction of the Union, especially its economic policy. So when Iberia's democratisation succeeded he finally decided to act. Along with fellow business reform minded people within the administration and private organizations, amongst them notably Opus Dei, he formed the Partido Renovador Democrático. The party advocated for cutting more government restrictions in the economy and generally scaling back the size of the state. These they argued would bring greater prosperity to the people of Iberia and ensure the capacity of the Union to withstand modern challenges. With lofty promises and great propaganda Ullastres and the party were able to seize the reins of control. They could now begin to shape the future."
 
 POLITICS_TORCUATO_FERNANDEZ_MIRANDA_DESC:0 "Born on the north coast of Spain in 1915 Torcuato Fernández-Miranda enjoyed an education in law before joining the civil war and leaving the conflict as lieutenant. Proceeding to make use of his education he started work as a law professor at the University of Oviedo. His connections to the Francoist regime would however not be limited to the civil conflict. Apparently picked by Franco himself, Fernández-Miranda was chosen to serve in the education department of the new Iberian state. He was reported to be an effective civil servant yet questioned on his political beliefs at times.\n\nOnly when he was able to rise higher in the state apparatus did he choose to disclose some of his leanings. Believing that the Union desperately required a democratic transition to continue thriving and not falling to the traps of ethnic tensions and representation. He soon became a solid part of the reformist faction of the government. Watching as inactivity and caution however reined in men like Fraga and other conservatives he realized the path for the Union required a different path. Creating a new faction around him he was able to garner the support of those with more radical views on democratization and social issues. He now steers towards providing a better and more fair future for the Iberian peninsula."
 
 #only give this to elected valcarcel
 POLITICS_ALEJANDRO_VALCARCEL_DESC:0 "Alejandro Rodriguez de Valcarcel is a man from another era.\n\nBorn in 1917 in the closing hours of World War I, the man had little of note occur to him until the Spanish Civil War. A dedicatet falangist, Valcarcel served in a falangist militia during the civil war. A student of law, Valcarcel was unable to finish his studies until after the war had concluded.\n\nThe man led an uneventful life for much of the 50's and some of the 60's, serving as a medium-level provincial governor. He slowly worked up the ranks of Iberia, and by the middle of the 1960's he held high government offices in service to the state. He was noted by Franco for his apathy towards reforms, as he did not like them, but did little to stop them.\n\nOnce Iberia democratized, he saw that his livelihood was being put in dire risk, as with the rest of the politicians of his sort. He later took the role of their leader, rallying all the old guard politicians behind him to create the new Unión Nacional, a party made from the merger of the União Nacional and the Falange.\n\nValcarcel may have won the election, but he has not won the war. Now that he is in power, it falls to him to bring back the Iberia of old, where the Falange reigned supreme. Valcarcel is a man from another era, and if he has his way, then Iberia shall return to it."
 
 POLITICS_ALFONSO_ARMADA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Armada Comyn has found himself reliving his glory days.\n\nBorn in 1920 to a family with a history of fighting and warfare, he was quick to pick up the tradition for himself. Deeply religious, it is easy to say that the apple didn't fall far from the tree. At the young age of 16, he opted to carry on his family's legacy in the best way possible - saving Spain from Bolshevism. After fighting through all of Spain, he later joined the Blue Division and participated in the Fall of Leningrad, aiming to help save a second country from Bolshevism.\n\nBy the late 1940's, Alfonso had become a military instructor in several different academies. He was a natural choice for promotion, from a mixture of genuine talent and political compatibility.\n\nDemocracy treated the man very poorly. He hated every facet, every moment of the system, but for the sake of his job he bit his tongue. He learned greatly from his comrades, who lost their positions for their protests. When the new democracy began to tear down Franco's legacy, he reached his limit. He secretly organized a coup, so that he may save Iberia from Bolshevism once more.\n\nAlfonso Armada shall see himself Caudillo, and he will ensure that Iberia's new state does not repeat the mistakes that made the old Caudillos weak."
 
 POLITICS_ANTONIO_SPINOLA_DESC:0 "António de Spínola was born in 1910 in Estremoz, in what was formerly Portugal. He had a very uneventful childhood, and his path to leadership began in 1920, when he entered the Military School of Lisbon. He learned there for eight more years, and his education paid off when he was made commander of the National Republican Guard. Come 1940, he was sent to Germany to observe their troops operate during Barbarossa.\n\nAntónio was never one for political involvement, finding that politics got in the way of his duties as commander. Even so, he always leaned towards the conservative side of things - though how much this truly showed itself is debatable. This effort clearly worked, since Spinola kept being granted promotion after promotion. It was joked that he would be a Caudillo before 1970, with how fast he was promoted.\n\nWhen Franco died, the Council could not find anyone else to replace his spot as President, and it increasingly seemed like Iberia would have to make do with only Caetano. That is, before Spinola intervened. Through some "surprise politics", he was found Franco's successor.\n\nHe may not have been a Caudillo by 1970, but he still came exceptionally close. Now, with politics as the forefront of his duty, Spinola has set to ensuring that Iberia stays content within its status quo, by any means necessary."
 
 POLITICS_MANUEL_MELLADO_DESC:0 "Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado was born in 1912, in Madrid. Orphaned at a very young age, he relied on his uncle to provide him with what he needed in order to continue studies. He entered the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1929, which was then headed by Francisco Franco. Under Franco's tutelage, he also joined the Falange in 1935. During the civil war, he was quick to distinguish himself and rapidly rose through the ranks, assisting in the operations of the secret police. When World War II broke out, he joined the Blue Division as one of its high commanders, overseeing their operations from Berlin.\n\nAfter the war, Mellado continued to obtain promotions. He was seen by his peers as a righteous man, and despite his lack of political commitment, his strong moral compass often landed him as a reformist. He had no particular attachment to them, but their proposals often found a champion in him.\n\nWhen the Iberian Council lost its grip on the country, they began to take drastic measures to keep their grip. The Council's desperate flailing came to a head when Mellado was ordered to fire upon protestors. Enough was enough.\n\nNow, Mellado has been appointed the provisional President of Iberia. Now, he must create a democracy from a state that did its hardest to stop it. Manuel Mellado wants the best for the Iberian people, but can he achieve this before the infighting consumes Iberia?"
 
 POLITICS_IBERIAN_COUNCIL_PRE68:0 "Every country needs a leader, and Iberia is no exception. However, how do you determine the sole, singular leader of a state when it has two equal leaders? The influence of both Caudillos wane and wax as time progresses, and one takes a greater role in the Union depending on just how much influence they could muster.\n\nSometimes, neither Caudillo can take precedence over one another. When both Caudillos are equal, then neither can honestly be called the greatest leader of Iberia. Therefore, a third party must take their place - the Council."

 caudillo.1.t:0 "지지도를 위한 투쟁"
 caudillo.1.d:0 "The unification of the Iberian peninsula had been a tumultuous, if necessary, task. In order to prevent divisive social and political issues from tearing the new country apart, both leaders of the previously separate nations agreed to hold a position of power that shared equal political standing. They became the Caudillos of Iberia, the saviours of a union besieged.\n\nHowever, neither man is entirely satisfied with their current standing and constantly wrestle for power and influence. To do this they use the sway of interest groups such as regional ethnicities or corporate interests. Hence the ever changing political arena of high Iberian politics is a scene to behold, with both Caudillos unwilling to let the other gain ultimate control of the nation."
