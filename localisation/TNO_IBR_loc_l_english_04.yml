 IBR.666.t:0 "트리움비라투스 탈퇴"
 IBR.666.d:0 "트리움비라투스의 재앙적 붕괴와 해체로 인해, 이베리아는 홀로 남겨졌습니다. 카우디요가 곧 명령을 내려 개혁과 같은 조치들이 시행될 것입니다."
 IBR.666.a:0 "우리는 홀로 설 것이다."
 IBR.1015.t:0 "라이히의 마지막 정복"
 IBR.1015.d:0 "Adolf Hitler received great applause on television today as he announced that the Reich has successfully defeated both America and Japan in its race to the moon. Eberhard Köllner, using a rocket based upon the A9/A10 design from WW2, and as a member of a team led by acclaimed scientist Wernher von Braun, successfully landed on Luna, broadcasted in multiple angles and with thousands of pictures taken. Celebrations have sparked across Germany, while America and Japan have both proclaimed they will continue the race and that it does not end with simply one man landing on a rock.\n\nThe news has received mixed responses in Iberia, and Caudillo Franco released a short and terse statement in response. Rumors from his inner circle state that all members of the government were greatly displeased that The Union has yet to even develop such technology, and was quite angry that the Germans were the ones to land first.\n\nAlready, several speculators have begun to question whether or not the Germans staged the landing for the propaganda, and conspiracy theories are abound."
 IBR.1015.a:0 "경쟁은 아직 끝나지 않았다!"
 IBR.1016.t:0 "연합의 날"
 IBR.1016.d:0 "환상적인 여름날인 오늘은 우리 두 국가가 하나로 합쳐진 날이며, 연합 전역이 이를 축하하고 있습니다. 카우디요 프랑코는 포르투갈어와 스페인어로 열렬한 연설을 하였고, 동시에 고령의 카우디요 살라자르도 모습을 드러내 모든 이베리아인들이 이베리아의 옛 영광을 되찾는 과업에 동참해야 한다고 연설했습니다."
 IBR.1016.a:0 "모두를 위한 연합!"
 IBR.1017.t:0 "포르투갈인 단결의 날"
 IBR.1017.d:0 "그 날은 1640년 포르투갈이 스페인의 지배에서 벗어난 역사적인 사건을 무색하게 했습니다. 단결의 날은 포르투갈과 이베리아 사람들에게 왜 연합이 탄생했으며 그것이 지키고자 하는 바가 무엇인지를 일깨워주는 엄숙한 날입니다."
 IBR.1017.a:0 "연합은 포르투갈을 지킬 것이다."
 IBR.1018.t:0 "이베리아 연합의 상태"
 IBR.1018.d:0 "1640년 이후로 이베리아는 통일된 상태가 아니었으며, 연합 이베리아는 대대적인 축하 속이 아닌, 화염 속에서 탄생했습니다. 독일이 포르투갈의 식민지들을 침공하면서, 포르투갈과 스페인인들은 히틀러가 그의 새로운 세상에서 비독일인들을 위한 자리를 남겨두지 않으려 한다는 사실을 깨닫게 되었습니다. 독일은 거대하였고, 이에 맞서기 위해 포르투갈과 스페인은 이베리아 연합이라는 하나의 국가로 연합하였습니다. 독일의 지브롤터 댐 건설은 지금은 조그맣게 쪼그라든 지중해 무역에 의존하던 수많은 국가들의 경제를 빠르게 망가뜨렸습니다.\n\n독일인들에 대한 혐오라는 하나의 공통점으로, 이베리아 연합은 이탈리아와 터키와 트리움비라투스를 이루었으나, 시간이 지나며 세 국가간의 관계는 소원해지고 있고, 트리움비라투스의 운명은 다가오는 몰타 회담에 달려있습니다."
 IBR.1018.a:0 "국력 보존을 위해 최선을 다하자."
 IBR.1019.t:0 "지브롤터 댐"
 IBR.1019.d:0 "파도 위로 100미터 가량 솟아오른 콘크리트 벽은 아침에는 탕헤르, 저녁에는 지브롤터 위로 거대한 그림자를 드리우고 있습니다. 14km에 달하는 이 벽은 유럽의 올리베로스 곶부터 아프리카의 시레스 곶까지 이릅니다. 대서양의 거대한 물살은 이 100m 벽을 뚫지 못하고 지중해로 들어오지 못하고 있습니다. 하지만 이 댐의 장점은 눈을 씻고 찾아봐도 없을 것입니다.\n\n아무도 원하지 않았던 이 댐을 유지하는 데 매년 1억 5천만 달러를 쏟아붇는 이베리아보다 피해가 큰 국가는 아마 없을 것입니다. 하지만 이 댐을 방치한다면, 해수면 위로 드러난 새로운 땅에 거주하는 수십만의 주민들의 인명피해가 발생할 것이고, 수백만명의 간접적 피해가 발생할 것입니다. 한때 지중해 해안이었던 곳은 소금 사막으로 변했고, 번성했던 발렌시아 항구는 이제 25마일 내륙에 위치하게 되었고, 빈곤, 실업, 마약 사용이 급증하고 있으며, 한때 번영했던 산업은 쇠락하고 있습니다. 매일 수백 척의 배가 드나들었던 지브롤터 해협은 이제 강력하게 통제되어 제 기능을 하지 못하고 있으며, 남유럽과 아메리카 대륙 간의 무역량은 심각하게 감소했습니다.\n\n독일은 아틀란트로파를 그들의 위대한 업적이라고 칭송하고 있지만, 그들은 지중해 도시들을 황폐화시켰고, 지중해 국가들의 경제를 망가뜨려 놨습니다. 아틀란트로파 계획의 핵심인 지브롤터 댐은 아직 미완공 상태입니다. 유럽 전역에 값싼 전기를 공급할 목적으로 설치된 수력 발전 터빈들은 1950년대 독일 경제 붕괴로 방치되어 있는 상태입니다. 댐 통제 시스템 또한 미완성 상태이며, 이베리아와 모로코를 잇는 철도와 고속도로 역시 착공에 들어가지도 않았습니다.\n\n이베리아의 지도자들은 교착 상태에 빠졌습니다. 그들이 댐 완공이라는 엄청난 일을 해낼 수 있을까요? 그들이 그걸 할 경제적 여유가 있을까요? 이베리아의 납세자들이 이 돈 먹는 하마를 위해 계속 세금을 바칠까요, 아니면 이 쓸데없는 댐에 관심을 거두고 다른 문제들에 집중하는 게 나을까요?"

They had to let go. Caetano did not protest, and understood what needed to be done. The union of Franco and Salazar was dead, and it needed to fail, for the better of their two nations.\n\n'We need to let go,' he said.\n\nIt must have seemed obvious for them at the time to create this union. To be able to bring about prosperity for both their countries, to defend against the Germans by our border, it all seemed so clear... but the years drew longer and longer, and still, nothing but a whisper from the other side of the mountains, and yet, it would seem that the union they made was met with nothing but failure. Terrorists, anti-unionists, nationalists, and republicans forced us all to very edge of life and death, and now with both of them gone there is no path forward.\n\nCaetano sat silently, calmly accepting that it needed to be done. It was sadly the only way to avoid utter catastrophe. He once had a genuine optimism for the Union, and accepted his duties as Caudillo with pride and a hope that the nation could be saved. No matter the memories he had fighting for the integrity of the Union, all the sacrifices that were made to survive, the great bonds made along the way, the smiles and the cheer from Portuguese and Spanish alike...\n\nIt had to be done. And so, it would seem, Portugal and Spain will go their separate ways. For a country he so loved would split apart, two brothers drifting away with the wind, never to be reunited again. It would be the last time the sea would ever kiss the sand; it would be the last time Iberia could be whole.\n\n'Goodbye, and for all that it is worth, I am sorry.'"

 ###########################The Death of Salazar
 IBR.1020.t:0 "살라자르의 죽음"
 IBR.1020.d:0 "Today, the housekeeping staff of São Bente Palace were horrified to find the corpse of Antonio Salazar in his bath. The body was quickly removed for an autopsy and burial, but the knowledge of his death managed to quickly escape the circle of secrecy that it was intended to remain in until the Iberian government can come up with an official story. Already, numerous underground forces within the Union are mobilizing, and worrying rumors of sedition within the Portuguese state have come to our attention.\n\nWith keeping the beloved Caudillo's death a secret being no longer an option, Iberian authorities must put all of their resources in play in order to keep the Union stable. Already, tanks have been spotted moving down roads in Lisbon, and martial law has been declared in several regions in Portugal.\n\nCaudillo Franco and Salazar's designated successor, Marcello José das Neves Alves Caetano, have already condemned any forces conspiring to take advantage of Salazar's death, but it does not appear that this will provide a conclusive end to the political chaos in Portugal. It appears that the only thing left to do is crack down as hard as possible, and divert every possible resource to ensuring the Union stays together."

 IBR.1022.t:0 "마지막 기둥"
 IBR.1022.d:0 "이베리아는 항상 지역 관념에 지나지 않았습니다. 지난 몇 년간 하나로 묶여있었지만, 공통의 목적이 아닌 공포에 의해서였습니다. 피에 굶주린 독일이 연합을 무너뜨리는 데 실패하자 연합은 그 목적을 잃어버렸습니다. 진정한 개혁에 대한 모든 희망은 사라졌고, 연합은 두 카우디요의 의지에 의해서만 굴러가는 처지가 되었습니다. 살라자르가 세상을 떠났을 때, 연합은 인내했고, 진정한 어떤 것이 탄생하길 빌었습니다. 그것은 이베리아의 시련을 견디게 해준 희망의 원천, 이베리아인이라는 정체성이었습니다.\n\n프랑코가 세상을 떠났을 때, 그 희망은 헛된 것임이 증명되었습니다. 몇몇은 그들의 구원자를 잃은 것에 대한 슬픔으로 흐느꼈고, 몇몇은 폭군의 죽음을 축하했고, 몇몇은 후회의 눈물을 흘렸으며 다른 몇몇은 그의 유산을 이어나가겠다고 맹세했습니다. 하지만 그들 모두 미래를 두려워하고 있습니다. 이베리아를 지탱해 온 마지막 기둥이 무너졌습니다. 두 번째 연합은 수백 년 전 그랬던 것처럼 종말을 맞을 것처럼 보입니다."
 IBR.1022.a:0 "칼을 통해."
 
 IBR.1021.t:0 "Tensions in Portugal Explode"
 IBR.1021.d:0 "The powder keg has finally exploded.\n\nEver since the death of Caudillo Salazar Iberia a fuse had been lit and had been heading towards an end from which Iberia could never recover. Each political event that had followed the unfortunate demise of the Portuguese Caudillo had added to this flame. First a number of Portuguese politicians had secretly initiated talks on how to manage a peaceful secession from the Union. Seeing the writing on the wall with the way Franco dealt with the political crisis they knew the only successful future Portugal could forge in the future was one on their own. With their political considerations that Portugal would lose influence in the Union they increased the strength of the flame.\n\nSome documents from these meetings have however made their ways into the hands of Basque separatists who without having the full picture came to the joyous conclusion that an imminent armed struggle would ensue between the secessionist Portugal and the remnants of the Iberian government. For them it was hence the perfect time to finally stand up for their own freedom and independence. The next bit of fuel to the flame was added.\n\nAs the news was carried in the wind, between distorted and reshaped to fit the agendas of various other splinter groups, the flame finally had found its end destination. With the uprising of the Basques following a few days of rapid preparation the peninsular began to be rocked by brutal civil war for the second time this century."
 IBR.1021.a:0 "The half island is in flames."
 
 IBR.1023.t:0 "Anarchy in Iberia"
 IBR.1023.d: "Trouble had been brewing across the half peninsula for a while now. Observers, both foreign and national, have argued that intense political incompetence in the heart of Iberian governance had detrimental effects to the stability of the Union. While localities desperately attempted to mitigate the damages caused by the poor political decisions made in Madrid, terrorist groups and freedom fighters had been quietly organising themselves to take advantage of the situation. This, in their eyes, was an opportune time to finally rid themselves of the hated Iberia yoke that had been oppressing them.\n\nNo matter the level of strict censorship applied to the national and local news, the populace nonetheless had felt the detrimental effects of decisions made at the top. Popular opinion, as much as it could be observed in these times of crisis, had switched from apathy into something far more sinister. No one now seemed to be able to stop the forces of history converging once again in Iberia. For the second time in a century the home of two of the greatest empires the world is descending into anarchy."
 IBR.1023.a:0 "Y entonces el diablo vino a visitarnos"
 
 IBR.1024.t:0 "A Crisis Gone too Far"
 IBR.1024.d:0 "Many philosophers and political theorists have placed the blame for political turmoil at the feet of poor economic conditions. After all, if people cannot even afford to meet their basic standards of need what do their have to lose in hurting those at the top who have made it so for them.\n\nFranco had in his pursuit of hard-line falangist economic policy not only alienated a great number of government officials but also tanked the already struggling Iberian economy. Day by day the newspapers were filled with headlines of leaders of capital and other economic figures taking their lives. The average citizen fared no better as even the spontaneously established black market began to run out of goods.\n\nProtest and economic standstill defined each city on the peninsula. As normal people began to turn their anger against the regime into action, a number of underground terror groups and freedom organizations saw their opportunity to finally push for the results they wanted.\n\nThe stability of the once so promising union had been undermined to a point where attempts from Madrid to rectify the situation were met either with harsh opposition or proven ineffectual. Seemingly the only answer now is violence." 
 IBR.1024.a:0 "The end of the Iberian project."
 
 IBR.1027.t:0 "A repeat of history"
 IBR.1027.d:0 "Franco's lack of action to remedy the concerns raised by opposition to his power grab, following Salazar's death, have led in many places around the Union to declare open revolt. Portugal, a particular flashpoint considering the issues around representation, has entirely slipped out of the grasp of the central government. While news of rioting and upheaval are coming in droves out of the region, Lisbon has entirely ceased communications with Madrid.\n\nThis however sadly was not the only concern. Other groups which had previously been hostile to the Iberian government have also taken this opportunity of crisis to break out in rebellion. Insurgents have been reported in a variety of Spanish cities. Their goal, unlike the Portuguese call for representation, was not entirely clear.\n\nIt was obvious to the Caudillo that Portugal would have to be suppressed on a large scale, but now even his own nation was wasting away around him. Traitors in his own ranks were making themselves visible. Previous Iberian loyalists who had seen their chance to change the system through working inside it had also lost hope when Franco had refused to cede ground to the opposition. Realizing that now the superstructure they had wanted could only be achieved through other means they as well have taken up arms against the new dictatorship. In the middle of all of this, Franco, by now besieged from every angle, still held onto his hopes for stable Iberia under his leadership. It is unlikely that he will let his opponents take that from him without a fight."

 #######The End Of Iberia
 IBR.1113.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - West Africa"
 IBR.1113.d:0 "With Iberia's days counted, the negotiation teams of Portugal and Spain are now arguing over the colonies in West Africa. Composed of Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania, the only deal that both teams have reached for now is that those territories owned by the Kingdom of Morocco will undoubtedly go to Spain.\n\nThe main area of disagreement between the two teams is Mauritania as this region wasn't owned by neither nation prior to the creation of Iberia. The Portuguese team argues it should be theirs to compensate for the loss of Angola and Mozambique, but the Spanish team is saying that the loss of those colonies were Portugal's fault. The area itself is plagued with bandits that spill over to the southern part of Western Sahara, so some members of the Spanish team believe it would be a good idea to give these areas to Portugal and that way take a weight off Spanish future responsibilities in Africa. Both teams are still arguing but a decision must be made..."
 IBR.1113.a:0 "Give Portugal the interior Sahara and Mauritania."
 IBR.1113.b:0 "Give Portugal everything south of Morocco."
 IBR.1113.c:0 "Give Portugal nothing!"
 
 IBR.1114.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - Equatorial Africa"
 IBR.1114.d:0 "In an unprecedented move, both negotiating teams have reached a deal over the territories of Equatorial Africa. Arguing that this region was split between both countries before Iberia existed, it has been decided that those territories owned by Spain would go back to them while those owned by Portugal would return to them. The news has been very well received by the governments of both nations, that hope to continue reaching good deals to avoid future tensions."
 IBR.1114.a:0 "A good deal"
 
 IBR.1115.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - Island Territories"
 IBR.1115.d:0 "In another surprising move, both negotiating teams have reached a deal over the island archipelagos owned by Iberia. Arguing that all the island groups were already owned by both countries before Iberia existed, it has been decided that those islands owned by Spain would go back to them while those owned by Portugal would return to them. The news has been very well received by the governments of both nations, that hope to continue reaching good deals to avoid future tensions."
 IBR.1115.a:0 "Another good deal"
 
 IBR.1116.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - Guinea"
 IBR.1116.d:0 "In what seems to be a recurring move, both negotiating teams have reached a deal over the colony of Guiné. Arguing that the colony was previously owned by Portugal and that as such most people there speak Portuguese and business in the region is closer to Lisboa than to Madrid, both negotiating teams have decided that Portugal should own the colony once Iberia fully splits. The news has been very well received by the governments of both nations, that hope to continue reaching good deals to avoid future tensions."
 IBR.1116.a:0 "Another deal? Marvelous!"
 
 IBR.1117.t:0 "Restoring The Embassies"
 IBR.1117.d:0 "As part of the process of splitting up Iberia, the process of restoring the embassies between the two soon-to-be countries has begun. While they won't be operative until the country is fully divided, records and material is already being shipped to the buildings that will host the diplomatic missions.\n\nBoth sides have already named their respective ambassadors, even if they might change the second after Iberia is gone. These two designees are now in charge of overseeing this process finish without any kind of delays. The Spanish negotiating team has declared that they don't like the naming of ambassadors so soon, specially since it comes with the full salary, but the Portuguese team has replied that the Spanish delegation in Lisbon has already occupied the building designated for the future embassy and the top workers there have began to meet with local people of power with the title of workers of the Spanish diplomatic mission in Lisbon. It seems that up until the last second, both sides won't agree on anything."
 IBR.1117.a:0 "May our relations ever be positive."
 
 IBR.1118.t:0 "Auditing The Supply Dumps"
 IBR.1118.d:0 "With the focus now on splitting the armed forces, it has been decided that the first step in diving all the supplies that the Federal Armed Forces have used during their existence. Although both negotiating teams have members that believe an even split of the armament is the best solution, there are also those that disagree with this solution.\n\nThe most radical members of the Spanish team believe that, since military industry controlled by Spanish companies during Iberian times was much greater than that in Portuguese hands, the equipment should be split proportionally to that, giving the future Spanish military much more resources than the Portuguese one that way. On the other hand, the Portuguese team argues that this very reason, the disproportion of military industry, means Portugal should get more equipment than Spain, since Spain could quickly make up the difference once Iberia is no longer on the map.\n\nBoth teams have been arguing about this matter for days now and if the government wants to make sure Iberia is gone before the end of time, it seems like it must intervene and force a decision; since no team is willing to reach an agreement."
 IBR.1118.a:0 "Spain produced more of that equipment. It's theirs."
 IBR.1118.b:0 "Give more to Portugal - Spain can make up the deficit."
 IBR.1118.c:0 "Split it fairly, it's worth the time."
 
 IBR.1119.t:0 "Sharing The Academia General Militar Records"
 IBR.1119.d:0 "Before the military can be finally split and the Federal Armed Forces abolished and replaced by the separate forces of the two nations, the records of the Academia General Militar, the military academy in charge of overseeing the Federal Armed Forces training, must be distributed between the two countries. As with other things, some members of both negotiating teams want the records to be split freely, with each nation taking whatever it wants, but this solution isn't shared by most.\n\nSome members Spanish team argue that most, if not all, of the records have been written and administered by Spanish military personnel and as such the records should go to Spanish hands.The Portuguese team, on the other side, says that once the Union is not united anymore, the Portuguese military will be much weaker than the Spanish one for a variety of reasons; and having the records from the academy at hand would help Portugal get up to speed with other countries.\n\nIt seems like this argument will take forever if it keeps its current pace, so the government will step in to make a decision for both teams, even if it's just to make sure Iberia doesn't exist for more than it needs to."
 IBR.1119.a:0 "Deny the request - the records belong to Spain."
 IBR.1119.b:0 "Send them over - Portugal could use the experience."
 IBR.1119.c:0 "Share the records freely."

 IBR.2000.t:0 "The End Of Iberia"
 IBR.2000.d:0 "Everything was ready. The last trucks with military equipment were already on their way to Portugal, the embassies were ready to begin working, border passes were beginning to make as if Iberia was no more and the two national leaders were each in the capital of their respective countries. Due to legal procedures, Iberia could only be divided if both leaders signed a law that dealt with that. While the Spanish leader had already signed it, the Portuguese Caudillo had insisted on signing the law once he was back in Lisbon. The day had come. Today, from his office, the Portuguese leader would sign the law that would kill Iberia once and for all.\n\nSomewhere in Toledo, an old Portuguese woman prayed for her life because she wasn't able to move back to her country. In Porto, a Spanish man, husband and father of three children, was attending a special seminary on the new laws that he and his family would have to obey from now on. In Tetuán, the Iberian federal flag was taken down and the Spanish flag was hoisted while colonial troops trained, now only with a Spanish instructor.\n\nAnd at that precise moment, a moment that would get lost to time, the radios throughout the whole peninsula and all the territories that up until then were under Iberian rule broadcasted the same message. Some did it in Portuguese, others in Spanish; but the message was clear: Portugal had signed the break-up law. Iberia was now part of history."

 #Zollverein events
 
 IBR.2002.t:0 "New Ventures with Germany"
 IBR.2002.d:0 "Our rapprochement with the Germans under Führer Speer has yielded significant fruit. Increased economic ties have been a boon for the economy, and German tourists and investors have helped revitalize many of the new coastal regions unearthed by Atlantropa. Now, one can see Germans everywhere, from Siemens investing in new developments in Catalonia to German tourists finding Lebensraum in the sunbeds of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe next logical move in our detente with Germania is Iberian entry into the Zollverein, the economic union which now encompasses much of Europe. The benefits would be enormous, duty-free access to a market of several hundred million, preferential treatment of Iberian companies, and easy access to the riches of the East. While entry into the Enheitspakt with all the commitments that it would entail would be a step too far-especially for the public-the Zollverein would be the perfect step for Ibero-German relations.\n\nAll that is left, is to send the proposal."
 IBR.2002.a:0 "Let us hope for a quick response."

 IBR.2003.t:0 "Iberia Wants to Join the Zollverein"

While historically, our relations with Madrid have left much to be desired, it seems that the recent "detente" between our two states has succeeded in mending ties.\n\nIberian entry into the Zollverein would be a colossal diplomatic triumph. Iberia would be the first major power not a part of our sphere to join the economic bloc, granting our goods both a new market and lending increased credibility to the claims that the Zollverein is not merely another extension of German hegemony. However, there has been some pushback by more conservative members in the foreign ministry, who are concerned that Iberian entry would undermine German dominance of the Zollverein.\n\nUltimately the decision is up to us."

 IBR.3000.t:0 "The National Animal?"
 IBR.3000.d:0 "Iberian unity has always been a rather dicey affair, especially in these turbulent times. While there are many who would use the instability to advance the cause of their own ethnic group, there are also plenty of loyal citizens who wish to keep our union intact. Artists, musicians, politicians, and even ordinary people have been known to come together to try and define a unified Iberian culture. Usually, these are mere blips on the radar, but sometimes something extraordinary comes from it, like the shared Conquistador pride, or the fact that both the Portuguese and Spanish have a hatred for Moors.\n\nAnd sometimes...these attempts end in disaster.\n\nIt all started off as a well meaning collaboration between the Lisbon and Madrid art guilds, in the hopes of producing a piece of art that symbolized the unity of Spain and Portugal. After some deliberation, the artists agreed that their project would consist of a giant mural displaying what they hoped to be "Iberia's new national animal". Taking the Spanish bull and the Portuguese rooster as pieces of inspiration, the artists slaved away day and night to create a masterpiece.\n\nUnfortunately, when it was finally unveiled before a crowd two weeks later, the reactions were less than stellar. The finished product, which for some reason ended up being a mixed up amalgamation of rooster and cow body parts with seven pairs of horns and at least three heads, immediately earned the ire of the entire nation that they were trying to appeal to. Described by onlookers variably as "an abomination", a "piece of vomit-inducing graffiti that wouldn't pass in an American art school", and "proof that Jesus died in vain".\n\nTo make matters worse, the "Iberian Chimera", as it has now been dubbed, was leaked to the international community, where in many countries it seems to have caught on immediately. Fortunately, in the grand scale of things this doesn't impact our nation too much, but the mental link between Iberia and the eldritch rooster-bull from hell in the minds of foreigners won't go away anytime soon."

I have strong reason to believe that, with the death of one of the Caudillos, Iberia will shortly collapse. I am by no means wishing for this to happen, though the possibility of its occurrence is one I cannot deny. Were the Union to collapse, it would signal to the Italians and others that I am vulnerable, and without your protection this state would surely wither away.\n\nBecause of this, this letter has been prepared to notify you that our diplomatic relationship is henceforth null and void. In order to prevent an abrupt cessation of relations, we will instead terminate them now, in a prepared manner.\n\nAlgeria will fall under the sovereign leadership of Yves Godard.

Debates have already begun on what classification it belongs to, and many paleontologists are flooding the scene to try and find more clues of how and when the dinosaur lived. Their best guess so far is that this twenty-two ton behemoth lived during the Middle Jurassic and roamed all over the local area in large numbers.\n\nUpon hearing its description, one of the soldiers who found it stated that a large, useless, dumb lizard must be named after the infamous German project to drain the Mediterranean. The name Atlantropasaurus quickly caught on, and many citizens in Iberia have found interest in the dinosaur, including government officials. This specific specimen has even been ordered to be put on display in Madrid as a testament to Iberian strength and knowledge, and will arrive in less than a week."

 IBR.3100.t:0 "The Procession"
 IBR.3100.d:0 "The gun carriage limped down the Avenida de Los Caudillos, with its procession stretching the full length of the thoroughfare. Representatives of the civil guard, federal army, Spanish and Portuguese home guards, and the Axencia kept the slow pace of marching. Even in Spain's heartland, the sorrow for Portugal's finest son was genuine. None of the many groups that terrorized Iberia dared to make its move here, lest they invoke the remaining Caudillo's wrath.\n\n"Mi General, we are going to exit Madrid's limits. We can return to El Prado now..." Franco stared down at his personal orderly as to indicate any further insistence on the matter would get him re-assigned to the Western Sahara. Fearing the television cameras had caught the change in his facial expression, the horse-bound Caudillo turned his face to the sky.\n\nAs the funeral march crossed the Iberian internal border, the expressions of grief became more intense, entire towns went out to see the coffin of the man who had determined Portugal's destiny for forty-two years. Carmen had told Franco that riding on horseback for the 500 km would be inadvisable for a man of 80, but he did not care. Once they reached the late Caudillo's hometown of Vimieiro, Franco remembered reading about his appointment as finance minister at the last page of a newspaper in 1926, receiving his congratulations ten years after, fighting with him over Spanish intervention during war, negotiations over the union, his calming him down during the Atlantropa disaster. Franco's heart sunk in a way it had not since his youth. Now, however, was not the time for that. After his orderly was replaced by a Portuguese counterpart when they crossed the border, Franco was the only member of the Madrid procession left by the time he stepped off his horse to follow the coffin into the chapel."

 IBR.3300.t:0 "Adeus a um Caudillo"
 IBR.3300.d:0 "Franco's father had never loved him, yet another thing that had set the two men apart. Even now, his desire to be buried alongside his parents unsettled the Generalissimo. He tried to repress his father's slight after he had become Caudillo, ignoring him for the lost cause that was his brother Ramon. He just about managed to do it by the time it was his turn to speak.\n\n"Antonio... principles of national sovereignty... Great united struggle against the red subversion... decent and hardworking man with a sense of humor."\n\nFranco could not stop himself from thinking about the man: He had been his rival, a massive pain whenever he got any of his holier-than-thou ideas through, that was for certain. He could feel his skin being burned by the intensity of the camera set-ups at the cathedral as he moved on to finish the speech.\n\n"But most of all... " The Caudillo sniffed ever so quietly, as the sentiments overwhelmed the carefully practiced emulation that he'd adopted, and his real, squeaky Galician voice took control.\n\n"He was my friend."\n\nNo-one outside Iberia paid much attention to what he said, talk in the foreign media was all about speculating on what sort of ailment he was suffering from for him to be wearing his characteristic sunglasses indoors."

 #AAS Operative Chain

 IBR.3101.t:0 "First Day on the Job"
 IBR.3101.d:0 "The countryside outside of Girona was unremarkable. With golden fields below, and gray, cloudy skies above, two absolute colors clashed, occasionally interrupted by the passing landmark. Guillermo was not the one driving, and the case he had been set on was light enough to only take him and his partner, Alejandro. The AAS undercover vehicle could feasibly fit four more people, though there were not going to be that many arrests.\n\n"Rules of contact?" asked his partner loudly.\n\n"Possible nonviolent, talk first, violent, shoot first, use careful discretion. This is possible nonviolent, so keep our guns holstered and allow the senior agent - you - to do the talking." his partner snickered. "What?"\n\n"Oh, nothing, Guillermo. It's just funny to see you new agents so diligent about textbook shit."\n\nAfter a while longer on the road, the two men found themselves at their location. A man, printing newspapers out of his garage. Not only did he clearly engage in the act of unauthorized self-publishing, the newspapers were also in Catalan. They most certainly were printed as separatist agitation - even though neither Axencia operative could read the language, they were sure all the same. The two men took several copies of the newspapers, destroyed his printing press, and drove off with the agitator in handcuffs.\n\nWhen he came home that night, Guillermo reflected over his first day as an AAS operative. The agents at the office would handle the case from now on using their evidence and testimony, but the process would be parallel to the traditional justice system. Such was the decree of the Caudillos following the horrific Battle of Barcelona. Despite its flaws, Guillermo understood the necessity of the measures, and promised himself he would do what he could in the name of justice going forward."
 IBR.3101.a:0 "A promising start for a new operative."

 IBR.3102.t:0 "A Lesson to Remember"
 IBR.3102.d:0 "The two Axencia operatives walked into the San Sebastián elementary school, their boots thumping on the floor as they walked. Guillermo had a gun, though he kept it holstered. Drawing a gun in school would be a disaster. His partner, Alejandro, the senior agent, was carrying a truncheon. While arresting someone as they were teaching a class was poor timing, they had been ordered to bring the man in as soon as possible.\n\nThe two men entered the classroom. "You are under arrest for nationalist agitation," said Alejandro, repeating his mantra in a practiced monotone. He had no sense of subtlety. As his partner wrestled the teacher onto the desk, handcuffed him, and struggled him out of the door, it fell on Guillermo to cover for the children.\n\n"Ah..." he looked at them, stepped towards the door, and gave them a small speech. "Your teacher was a Basque separatist! That means he tried to destroy Iberia. Look out for anyone who does the same!" His words were drowned out by the sounds of thrashing and screams from the hallway outside the classroom.\n\nAs they led the now bloodied and bruised man out of the building, Guillermo stumbled on a doorframe, falling down the steps of the entrance. "What the hell? Pay attention to your surroundings, clumsiness could be the end of you some day!" The junior operative, still in a daze, picked himself up and apologized.\n\nOn their way back to the station, Guillermo stared out the passenger seat of the AAS undercover car. The children. Their faces of horror watching someone they knew being removed by force. Their fear hearing the pounding and screams from the hallway. He had skimmed the teacher's profile before the mission, he was no violent criminal. He did not deserve this.\n\nBreaking the silence, his unfazed partner began to chuckle..."

 IBR.3105.t:0 "The Fallen Revolutionaries" 
 IBR.3105.d:0 "Every few minutes, Adolfo could hear gunshots in the distance. His city was on fire, and sandbags lined the streets below his apartment just as it was 26 years ago. The world was different then. Adolfo had once seen a great future for the Iberian proletariat, an almost sacred struggle against the Fascists and Monarchists who sought to destroy the meager progress the Republic had made. But now, as the CNT once again faced off against Nationalist soldiers in the streets of Barcelona, he understood that that dream was dead. Perhaps, in another world, the Revolution could have succeeded. But not in this one.\n\nAdolfo opened his closet, removing a small pile of clothing to find a small latch on the bottom. He opened a secret cache, memories of decades long past. There was his 'Tigre' rifle, the weapon he had used in his first and only kill. A weapon he had imagined he would use many times again resisting Francoist domination after the fall of the republic, but never did. He moved the rifle slightly to reveal an old black-and-white photograph underneath it. There he was, on the left hand of the image. A few inches shorter than the other young men with him. His facial hair had not yet grown in. He was holding his rifle and smiling. With him were four comrades, all of whom he remembered well. Ramón, who could make anyone laugh even at the worst of times. Shot by a sniper in January of 1939. Manuel, a brilliant student and equally brilliant fighter. Told Adolfo he was running away to France and was never heard from again. Sara, the girl with glasses that he could not help but imagine one day marrying. Captured by the Francoist regime shortly after the war, and never seen again. Asunción, the childhood friend that had convinced Adolfo to take up arms. Also captured and never seen again. What had his battles really accomplished? And what did the young revolutionaries in the streets now expect to happen?"

 IBR.3106.d:0 "Dear Carmen,\n\nWe arrived in this country only a few short weeks ago, and already I am counting the time before we are rotated out. Some of the older men have shared the stories they've heard about the Rif War, the oppressive heat, the constant threat of fighting a foe which seemed to disappear like ghosts into the desert sands. We are lucky the Italians don't seem half as skilled as the Rifians the Legion fought so long ago.\n\nWe are continuously on the move, watching the emptiness for any sign of FLN or Italian activity. Combat comes almost as a relief after days of patrolling the desert, but the worst of it happens when we fight alongside our Pied-Noir allies. While they may be able soldiers, their brutality, and treatment of those unlucky to fall enough into captivity is something that I will never be able to forget.\n\nI look forward to the day when I can leave this blasted desert. Our unit is supposed to be rotated out within six weeks at most, hopefully in time for our anniversary. We will be on the offensive soon and I will not be able to write to you for some time. I promise to do everything in my power to ensure that I make it home in one piece. Please don't worry too much about me, as if you won't, for I will take care of myself and look forward to the day I am able to be with you again."

 IBR.3107.d:0 "Captain Saturnino de la Hidalga was uneasy aboard the Canarias. Whatever upgrades the Federal Government might have afforded for the old cruiser, they would not make up for the fact she was built to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Her 203mms might scare unruly natives, but they certainly would not stand up to anything the Italian navy had to offer. Saturnino tried to relax, there was little risk of attack while in Oran, where his squadron was well under the protection of coastal batteries.\n\nThe captain eyed the Portugese landing ship two hundred meters to his right with increasing anxiety, hoping that it would deliver the last batch of tanks to the expeditionary brigade so he could get on his way back to Gibraltar. Ironically, he thought, the LCPL was a former Italian ship - one could tell by the design. That idiot Salazar bought it second hand, and the seaman was sure the Caudillo had paid more than it was really worth. Nevertheless, it got the job done, and the last Ibíce was rolling out its cargo hold and into the dock within thirty minutes, albeit in reverse. Saturnino, satisfied with his job, gave the order to leave the port...\n\n"Mi Capitán!" The anxious engineer's screech couldn't mean anything good, he could feel it in his bones. "We... thought it was an error, but the Cervero has picked up the same signal." Looking at the radar screen from afar, Saturnino spotted the approaching blips. "Shit." For a second, he was paralyzed, but his aristocratic officer instincts got the better of him."

 IBR.31071.t:0 "The Engagement" 
 IBR.31071.d:0 "The FIAT G.91s approached the Iberian flotilla at a breakneck speed, lest the HA-300s based at Murcia could get to the first. Amidst the initial volley of flak fire from Oran's defenses, flight Lt. Lombardi had some good news to tell his men: "We've spotted the flagship, it looks like the NLF bastards didn't lie. Remember, hit the landing ships, don't waste your bombs on... shit." It was already too late, Martionetti and Frigerio were on a vector straight towards the Canarias, and their FIATs sped right past Lombardi's. Unsurprisingly, he could not reach them by radio. "Technical difficulties, my ass." Once they return from the raid he would get them court-martialled, their insubordination could cost the entire operation.\n\nStruggling to keep his composure, Captain Saturnino was fixated on the black puffs that perpetually missed their targets, if ever so slightly. By now, the 203mms had been aimed, but the plane's approach was too difficult to... two of them were breaking off. The captain threw himself at the cruiser's intercom, virtually stapling his hand to the "talk" button while holding his binoculars with the other. "Gunnery Officer Perez... RANGED SHOT AT 200 METERS steady... ELEVATION 36°... steady." He could spot the muzzle flashes from the Italian's 20mm cannons, and soon, the ship's hull was taking their lead. It was inaccurate at that range, but it might make a lesser captain keep his head down. No, not him, not a de la Hidalga. "NOW." The main battery went off in a heap of powder.\n\n"FRIGERIO YOU FUCKING IMBECILE." Lombardi cried in desperation as the airman's left wing was destroyed by shrapnel from the Canarias. Marionetti managed to pull out, but sure enough, he passed over the dock and an Iberian MANPAD disintegrated his plane within a few seconds. With his formation shattered and the Iberians alerted, Lombardi had no choice."

 IBR.3108.d:0 ""That went better than even I had expected at first!" said Salazar. Shaky, rheumatic hands poured Madeira wine onto two curvy-bottomed wineglasses.\n\n"And I wish the rest of us can say the same- just half this time, António." Francisco Franco swirled the dark amber spirits of his half-empty wineglass. A wrinkly scowl met his stare from its polished sheen. "Never was a good trade for it, not after we turned thousands of our boys into buzzard feed," Franco grumbled.\n\n"It" laid next to the liquor bottle obtained from Salazar's private stores: a piece of paper, letter size, office-white and pristine but for intricate calligraphy at its center flanked by two crests. Salazar bore no children - but Franco swore he entered their office cradling the treaty's cover page like it were his newborn babe.\n\n"Now now," Salazar replied, "don't be so harsh on yourself that you'd overlook victory for small defeats. Iberia has won its greatest war since the Anti-Bolshevik Crusade. Algeria has been made whole, its Iberians made safe by those men. Our faith paid off in spades, Francisco; what's not worth celebrating over some wine?"\n\n"Speaking of faith." Franco paused to quaff from his glass. Warm, sweet wine blazed a path from palette to stomach. "You've been heaping plenty on the French madman and his cohort of thugs."\n\n"Show me someone who said he did nothing to win the war for us and I'll show you a liar. In any case, he's our man on the ground - no more, no less. We'll reel him in if he steps out of line; until then, the guy will do us better keeping the peace in Algeria's east.""

 IBR.3109.t:0 "After the Loss" 
 IBR.3109.d:0 "Salazar ignored the light switch when he had hobbled back to the office hours ago. Trailing behind him, Franco left the lights unswitched as he settled on a nearby chair. What light was cast against the lurking shadows gathered around Salazar's tremulant, hunched back came from incandescent cathode ray tubes flashing grainy Technicolor images and transmitting grainy noise at Iberia's two most powerful men. One choked a sob as a rocking chair swayed him back and forth.\n\nThe other lit a cigar. Tiny embers and speckles of ash struck out against the blue glow of breaking news cascading from La 1's high rise offices in Madrid. Pleasure yachts and cruise liners alike cramped with huddled, panicked refugees from bow to stern. Docks along Iberia's new coast creaking under tonnage above and beyond what they were rated. Riots in Barcelona, Lisbon, Córdoba. Mutinies. All washed past the caudillo as a waterfall's torrent rushes past an outcrop. He was a cliff wizened with age; conflict only polished his edges to their old sheen.\n\nIt was these edges which Franco breathed out in smoky wisps. "Though I believe we could have reasoned with the Italians," he said to no one. Had the caudillo not glanced to his right, he would not have caught Salazar turning rigid for a split-second. Franco stifled a sigh. Time for Plan B.\n\nA calloused hand nudged his Portuguese colleague back to their dimly lit office, earning him baleful, bloodshot eyes atop heavy purple bags. Franco jerked his head at the TV screen. The Spaniard's next words fell like a rockslide: grave, gravely, and to the point."
 IBR.3109.a:0 ""We have bigger problems than wounded pride now, António.""

 IBR.3110.t:0 "After the Peace"
 IBR.3110.d:0 "Dragging smoke from his cigar, Francisco Franco looked away from the TV screen and past his shoulder. "You look glum today," he said, pausing a moment to puff another ash-laden cloud. "Like yesterday." The caudillo offered an unlit roll to the office's other occupant.\n\nAntónio de Oliveira Salazar swatted it away with a glower. "I've been wondering why for a week now," he grumbled. Raising a withered fist in the air Salazar continued, "Then I remember only I gave more than a damn about Algeria in this Godforsaken country-!" Threadbare tendons and brittle bone cracked against varnished hardwood, and the Portuguese strongman cursed as he cradled his self-inflicted injury close to his chest.\n\n"And I wanted Andalusians for my Morita. Can't have everything in the world, so she settled for a car." Franco turned back to the TV set, just in time for the special program RTI devoted to the armistice and the establishment of the Mandate of Algeria. That newsmen can now present their scripts in moving screens mere moments after worthwhile stories unfold - it always amazed the old Spaniard whenever he entertained the thought. "The same goes for the Italians and our citizens in the new Mandate, just with a little more trust. They don't like terrorists any more than we do."\n\n"We're caudillos, Francisco. Requisition a pack of asses and the Guardia will have them herded outside the Cortes by noon."\n\nThe broadcast droned on while Franco considered his reply. Then he ground his cigar on an ashtray, a wrinkled grin on his face. "The Council might not want their relatives so close to their workplace.""

 IBR.3111.d:0 "The rickety door creaked open, only unveiling the hollow melody of dust-filled wind, where the village of Vinaròs would have unleashed a cacophony of bustling chatter and ringing bells. Nonetheless, from an adjacent hall, Dulcinea beamed, dashing toward the opening. Her son was finally back from his weeklong fishing expedition out in the salt wastes of Costa del Azahar. Without a thought, she pulls him into as much of a deep embrace as her aging arms can manage. However, as she is about to gush about her pride in him, she looks into his eyes and only sees disappointment, bitterness, and despair.\n\n"Diego!", a cracking voice full of joy rang out at the far end of the hall, either unaware of the somber mood or not caring, just happy that his brother's back.\n\n"Hey, José...", Diego forces his chapped lips into a pained smile as José's sprouting legs come sprinting toward the doorway, launching him into an even deeper and more suffocating embrace. "How many hauls did you catch this week?", he asks, prompting water to come flowing back out of Diego's eyes.\n\n"Three", he finally croaks as his throat swells up. Three hauls. Twenty years ago, his father would have caught three hauls in an hour. Every month, it seems like the sea runs further east and her yields grow worse. At this rate, they will run out of money to pay expenses and be evicted from their dying village within the year. Dulcinea gazed forlornly at the rows of empty villas outside and the endless expanse of white, dusty earth where the Mediterranean used to be. Her family has stubbornly clung on to their home as long as they could, but Atlantropa has forced their hand, and the inevitable must be embraced while she can still do it on her own terms."

 IBR.3114.d:0 "The Palace of the Cortes could be an eerie place. Footsteps echoed off the wall, and the palace was empty. A creepy sort of empty. Minister of Agriculture Rafael Duque could only hope that nobody watched too closely as he entered the chamber late and took a seat in the front row. The chamber felt almost like a lecture hall, recalling old memories from the years just before the Union's founding.\n\nHe looked around the chamber. Caudillos Salazar and Franco, and another man whom Duque could not quite remember the name of, were seated at the front of the chamber, facing the council. Seated on the front row were 7 other Portuguese ministers and 8 Spanish ministers. Besides them in the second row were 14 men whom he either knew poorly or did not recognize at all. Among them were Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, General Agustín Muñoz Grandes, Professor José Sánchez Asiaín, and industrialist José Manuel de Mello. In total, 2 Caudillos, 16 government ministers, and 14 representatives of Iberia's most important economic, security, and academic interests. Them, and whoever it was sitting beside the Caudillos.\n\n"Good evening gentlemen" began that man, standing from his seat to speak from the podium. "I, Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel, am pleased to inaugurate this first session of the Iberian Council. The honorable Caudillos Francisco Franco and Antonio Salazar have honored me with the title of President of the Council."\n\n"The terrible attack on the Municipal Palace of Coruña has demonstrated the vulnerability of the Union in its present state. As we develop proposals for the future course of Iberia, our Caudillos shall have the time to carry out their executive duties. By lending advice to the Caudillos, we ensure cooperation between Portuguese and Spanish officials and coordinate the policy of the Union. At this time, I recognize Caudillo Salazar, who will deliver remarks on the situation in the Far East."\n\nThe first Council Session lasted for 5 hours, as Salazar held a blunt, strategic discussion on Portugal's stolen colonies in Goa and Timor. In the meeting Salazar was free to discuss the world as he saw it, ordering councilors to develop plans to achieve his vision. Democracy this was certainly not, but even councilors more sympathetic to reform were pleased with the streamlining of the government decision-making process."

Hundreds of Iberia's most powerful, influential, and educated figures had assembled in Madrid for the inauguration of the Iberian Council. The curtains at the back of the chamber pulled back to reveal the Caudillos standing behind them. Franco and Salazar entered the chamber to rousing cheers. They sat in two chairs on either side of the podium, each embroidered with the Coat of Arms of their respective nations.\n\nA few seconds passed in near silence, then Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel emerged from behind the curtains to take the stand. "Assembled Officials, Ministers and Soldiers, Peoples of Iberia" he began, "By the joint mandate of Caudillo Franco and Caudillo Salazar, I, Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel, am honored to call to order the first session of the Council of the Iberian Union!" Loud Cheers filled not only the Palace Chamber, but residences across the peninsula, as men, women, and children watched and listened to the heavily publicized proceedings live on television and radio.\n\nValcárcel praised the Union for its success in preserving peace, stability, and security, over the past several years. At the same time, he acknowledged the problems that had come to plague Iberia--political gridlock, a slowing economy, and rising tensions. The council, Valcárcel explained, had been designed by the ingenious Caudillos specifically to solve these problems, to foster a greater sense of Iberian brotherhood, and give the common people a greater voice in their governance.\n\nFranco was ever diligent in perfecting the management of Iberia's economy and its government institutions. Salazar had valiantly taken to work to protect Iberia from foreign threats following the callous betrayal by Iberia's supposed Italian and Turkish allies. Valcárcel himself was to be the President of the Council, tasked with organizing and conducting the proceedings, serving as the primary representative of the Caudillos.\n\nThe speech would last for only around twenty minutes, but would be ingrained in the collective consciousness of the Iberian people for years to come. A new era of Iberian politics has begun."

 IBR.3116.d:0 "Franco stood before an anxious audience, few if any of whom felt comfortable knowing that they were now involved in the response to the worst act of terrorism in the history of the Union. "Gentlemen," he began "I will not lie to you. We were unprepared for this week's attack. Our intelligence community failed to recognize the scale of the planned operations, and our police and military were not ready to make a decisive and immediate response. We cannot allow any attack like this to happen again.\n\nWe have long known that a small underground CNT resistance persisted ever since the liberation of Catalonia 25 years ago. This morning the Iberian Intelligence Center prepared a detailed report on documented acts of homicide, assault, and arson linked to the CNT, showing that in the past seven years CNT violence has been increasing yearly. The failure of our government to recognize and react to the rise of this terrorist activity is damning. It should not have taken a tragedy as severe as Barcelona to formulate a response.\n\nIn addition to their comprehensive review of CNT activities since the Union's formation, the Intelligence Center has identified several extremist organizations which have escalated their activity, emboldened by the CNT's actions in Barcelona. Already last evening, a security officer was attacked in Bilbao by a 23-year-old extremist Jimeno Inchausti. In his interrogation, Inchausti admitted that he had not worked alone, but was part of a network of Basque-separatists calling themselves 'Euskadi Ta Askatasuna'. Between 1950 and 1963, only 15 murders could be linked to extremist groups besides the CNT. However, in just this past month, no fewer than 7 such acts of violence have taken place--4 in Navarra, 2 in Portugal, and 1 in Asturias.\n\nIt is all but certain that these terrorist groups will expand their resources and intensify their activities in the coming months. Increased funding and supplies will need to be provided to our military and intelligence services to identify and eliminate these groups. Eliminating terrorism needs to be the primary goal of all government officials, and all actions taken must consider potential effects on terrorists' ability to undermine Iberia's unity."

This morning her husband Ángel, 38 years old, attended the funerals of his wife and children. Ángel lost his home, his wife, many friends and neighbors, and two of his children. Mrs. Serrano's father, 51 year old army veteran Antonio Torres, lost his brother Francisco to communist terrorism 27 years ago, and now has lost his daughter and two grandchildren to the same terrorists that plagued Catalonia in his youth. Dolores died as a hero, shielding young María Isabel from the violence, and as a martyr, the victim of an attack on the very soul of Iberia. Dolores, Carmen, and José Luis, are far from alone. Hundreds of men, women, and children, became martyrs three days ago."\n\nToday's session was far quieter than any that had come before it. A few councilors struggled to hold back tears as Franco lamented the tragedy that had befallen Barcelona days earlier. Ending his speech with a minute of silence, the Caudillo bowed his head and tightly gripped the podium, his brows revealing suppressed anger.\n\n"We will destroy the terrorists."\n\nThe council erupted into applause, and Franco left the stage. Valcárcel stepped up to the podium. His speech began much as Franco's had, solemn and austere, but soon shifted his focus to matters of government policy. "Councilors, we are engaged in a struggle for the very spirit of Iberia. For the union to survive, your service is urgently needed. Caudillo Franco and Caudillo Salazar have ordered new legislation to provide the Axencia Anti-Separatista the power and resources necessary to fully eliminate the leftist threat. Iberia cannot afford a government divided by factionalism or language, by politics or geography. Her council must stand united against terrorism!\n\nEven as they applauded, many councilors were deeply nervous. Never in the history of Iberia had so many people been tasked with as important a task to complete in such a short timeframe. Murmurs filled the Palace after Valcárcel's speech. Most councilors did not know more than two dozen other people in the chamber. Who among them would write the legislation, and how could it be debated without sending the whole council into chaos?"

Such were the measures that now had to be taken as the terrorist threat escalated.\n\nWith so few men on the council, it would be obvious if anyone were missing, and even more obvious if an unfamiliar face were to appear. And so, as Manuel Fraga entered the chamber for his first session, he could feel dozens of curious and suspicious eyes moving over him. Franco rose from his seat and began to speak. "Gentlemen, I am pleased to welcome Señor Manuel Fraga into the Council. After much deliberation, Salazar and I have appointed him to head the newly established Ministry of Information. In this role, Fraga will lead a remewed, more organized effort to combat extremist propaganda. Several smaller bureaus in the present Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labor, and Ministry will be reorganized under Fraga's supervision, to ensure a consistent, hard-hitting effort against propagandists across the nation. I give the floor to Señor Fraga."\n\n"Thank you my Caudillo," began Fraga, ""Good evening gentlemen. As we attempt to bring an end to terrorism in Iberia, the terrorists have adapted new tactics, and new strategies to win over those vulnerable to their messages. In Girona last week, a group of CNT members briefly hijacked the city's largest radio station, preaching absurd anti-government conspiracies to thousands of people. Our battle against terrorism is just as much a battle against propaganda, and if we are to succeed in our mission we need to organize and expand our own media outreach efforts. The terrorists' propaganda is specifically designed to inflame regional tensions, and speak primarily to disaffected young men."\n\n"If we are to succeed against terrorism, we need to target their recruiting grounds. The new Ministry of Information will devote the majority of its efforts to the regions and cities where terrorists are most active, with media messaging focused on reminding people of the great things the Caudillos have done for them, instilling fear in anyone who would think to oppose our security forces, and removing the 'mystique' of terrorist groups, turning them from subjects of fear and fascination into subjects of disgust and mockery."

 IBR.3119.d:0 "When he was a professor at the University of Duesto, Cecilio Mariñelarena never would have imagined himself having a political career. As the only Basque economist on the Iberian Council, Mariñelarena had frequently involved himself in discussions regarding the growth of terrorist activity in the region. He held the controversial belief that, though the Basque Country overall was among the wealthiest regions in Iberia, the rapid economic changes in the past decade were nonetheless significant factors in the growth of separatist extremism. As Valcárcel concluded his introductory remarks, he listened carefully to hear the full details of the bill Manuel Fraga, newly appointed Minister of Information, was about to introduce.\n\n"Gentlemen, I am pleased to report that in just this past week, the Axencia Anti-Separatista uncovered and destroyed a large ETA weapons cache near Vitoria, and arrested 12 terrorist plotters in Tarragona." Fraga paused while his audience cheered. "Though the seizure of weapons and arrest of conspirators are vital to the Union's security and these recent victories are significant, our media efforts are just as critical. A cache of ten thousand guns means nothing without as many terrorists to hold them, which is why I am putting forth a bill to increase funding to the AAS Information Office by 50%, to enable the AAS to purchase radio and television ad-space at greatly a reduced price, and to initiate a thorough review of the history textbooks used in secondary and tertiary schools to identify and remove Separatist-sympathetic content." Even before Fraga gave the specific details of this bill, the loud applause made it obvious to everyone in the chamber that it would pass overwhelmingly. In the end, only five councilors of the 480 present voted Nay: All hardline conservatives objecting to what they perceived as a 'soft' and useless method to combat terrorism.\n\nMariñelarena joined the applause, and voted in favor of the bill. But though he both publicly and privately supported the bill's aims, he was frustrated. He already had to worry about paranoid conservatives suspecting that he was sympathetic to the separatists on account of his origin. There was only so much he could feel comfortable suggesting that Iberia's economic policy contributed to radicalization."

Information Minister Manuel Fraga stood at his left, and respected Law Professor and councilor Torcuato Fernández-Miranda stood at his right. Strangers before the council's formation, these three men had become increasingly close in the past few months. Occasionally the three were spotted at a cafe together, and often they supported the same initiatives in the Council. Tonight, though, was the most blatant showing of their informal alliance. Ullastres began a speech which had been co-written by himself and the other two councilors.\n\n"In recent months, the efforts taken by our Caudillos, the military, police, and intelligence to combat terrorism have successfully crushed numerous plots. Nonetheless, public support for the regime has faltered in the face of disappointing economic growth, in addition to the lingering fear of terrorism and crime. If we are to maintain the goodwill of the Iberian people, it is vital that in addition to our expansions to the security apparatus, we expand our domestic institutions.\n\nThe small-scale poverty relief programs in the Iberian Union result in most of the unemployed suffering from poor living conditions, and in a handful of the poorest communities malnutrition continues to stain our Union. We are here today to introduce for discussion a detailed plan to combat poverty and expand public support for the government, while continuing to protect the status of the firms that form the backbone of the Iberian economy."\n\nOver the next several hours, the council discussed and at times debated over the viability of the new plans. While broad support could be reached for a few programs, particularly the proposed reforms to Seguridad Social, others proved highly controversial. At one point, an argument between Manuel Fraga and Rafael Duque became so heated that Franco himself intervened to bring the council back to order.\n\nIt is overwhelmingly likely that the next few months will see significant changes to Iberia's domestic policy, but exactly which changes will be made and which will be rejected remains unclear. In any case, after today's discussion nobody can deny either the existence or the significance of the collaboration between Ullastres, Fraga, and Fernández-Miranda, increasingly referred to by other councilors as..."

 IBR.3121.d:0 "It is hard to imagine the Battle of Barcelona coming at a less convenient time, if it makes sense to say that there is a "convenient time" for such a tragedy at all. The Iberian council was still young, its members inexperienced, and the powers and limitations of the new legislature not entirely clear. Nonetheless, the Council prevailed through its first crisis, quickly drafting and passing legislation to better combat terrorists wherever they were to be found.\n\nThe Iberian Council has been tested, and it has passed its test. Few still doubt that the new legislature could solve at least some of the problems facing the Union. Perhaps, then, it is no surprise that mere weeks after Barcelona several members of the Council's reformist faction have launched initiatives to overhaul various elements of the Iberian legal system and government policy.\n\nThe "Ullastres Plan" and "Fernández-Miranda Plan", as they are informally known, have gained significant traction within the Legislature. Both plans are several hundred pages long, composed by dozens of authors, and advocate radical transformations to Iberian law and fiscal policy. The "Ullastres Plan" focuses on centralizing the government, rationalizing the administrative structure, and eliminating corruption, while the "Fernández-Miranda Plan" is focused on expanding social welfare, clarifying the definition and rights given to citizens, thereby ensuring the loyalty of the Iberian people.\n\nThe reform faction is all but unanimous in their support for both plans, and though no hard numbers are available, it is thought that somewhere between 30% and 40% of conservatives generally favor the plans as well. They have the backing of both Caudillos, and Manuel Fraga, a man respected by the council's reformists and conservatives, has emerged as a loud advocate for the programs. With such a broad coalition of support, there is no question that these plans represent the future of Iberian governance. However, the current plans are rough drafts sorely lacking in specifics, and seeing them transformed into actual policy will take months if not years of effort."

 IBR.3122.d:0 "Alberto Ullastres knew that his proposals for economic reform had little chance of being approved by the council. His plan, a plan for rapid economic liberalization and development was as bold as it was controversial. Salazar had been the architect of Iberian economic policy ever since the establishment of the Union; he would surely not reject his own ideas in favor of a radical change of course. But perhaps, Ullastres thought, Franco would be a little more receptive. If there was one thing Ullastres had learned in his years in government, it was that Francisco Franco was not fond of lectures. Their lunch meeting was one of fraternity just as much as one of politicking. But light gossip was not why Ullastres was there. "You know, Señor Caudillo, you could be the face of Iberia's greatest economic boom. Economic growth has been slow, and the rest of Europe has gone to hell. What better time could there be to remind the Iberian people the kind of leader you are?"\n\nFranco already knew of the plan, at least in its broader strokes. "Alberto, we both know it isn't my ideas you'd be putting my face on." The Caudillo paused for a moment. "I'll think about it, Señor Ullastres."\n\nUllastres left the meeting feeling somewhat disappointed. But when the council assembled a few days later, he was stunned. Franco gave a lengthy, passionate speech advocating the reform plan. Perhaps it was vainglory, perhaps a need to show himself as superior to Salazar. Perhaps a genuine change of heart, or perhaps part of a wider strategy. Both technocrat and anti-technocrat alike were surprised to hear what they now heard, but the Spanish Caudillo's words swayed many in the middle. The planned changes would be the largest that the Iberian Union had seen in its history."

The literate classes of Spain ought to be aware that their King had deliberately caused the recent recession, debasing the currency with disastrous consequences in order to enrich himself and his allies. The very tools the political elite deemed necessary to preserve the Spanish Empire were instead bringing only destitution and corruption.\n\nAlberto Ullastres could not help but imagine de Mariana smiling down on him as he organized his notes. Since the heady days of life as a university student, it had been his life's goal to see his country's economy liberalized. It is why he taught Political economy at his alma mater before he became an advisor to the Caudillos. It is why he encouraged fellow Opus Dei members to involve themselves in politics. And it is why he had done so much to convince Franco that he should be made Minister of Trade.\n\nThe battle over the future of Iberia's economy had been a protracted one, and the victory of the technocrats was by no means a foregone conclusion even just a few weeks ago. But with the backing of Franco and much of the Iberian intelligentsia, the technocrats undertook intensive lobbying efforts to persuade moderate councilors over to the reformist side. Despite considerable opposition, when the council was called to a vote, the 'Law for the Economic Revitalization of Iberia' passed 280-217. Ullastres was overjoyed, and took to the podium with great confidence.\n\n"Fellow Councilors! Today, we have placed Iberia on a path to great prosperity.

Our industry will be both modernized and expanded to remain competitive in an ever-developing world, and our rural communities provided the resources they need both to feed our rising population, and live just as well as their urban countrymen.

Nobody could honestly say that they were surprised at the outcome of the council's recent economic discussions, even if some of the more radical councilors found it terribly disappointing. Everyone, from the most ambitious reformist to the most ardent conservative could support efforts to modernize agricultural equipment. Everyone could support measures to ensure that lberia's weapons manufacturing be expanded to better deal with terrorism. Everyone could support modest decreases in business taxes to ensure continued growth.\n\nSalazar was always confident in his economic program and steered the Portuguese councilors to unanimously support what was essentially the continuation of the last decade's agenda. Most Spanish advisors agreed, and the sort of debate over economic policy Salazar feared may happen did not manifest.\n\nThe new economic legislation passed by the Caudillos today is not headline news. Its provisions are in line with previous policies. Its changes to taxation affect only a small percentage of Iberians. It does not call for sweeping changes in government expenditures. It is, however, hard to dispute that its changes will be of benefit to the Iberian nation.

With the support of all but a few dozen hardline conservatives, these measures were largely uncontroversial. The same could not be said of the recent economic discussions. For months, reformists and conservatives had argued over the direction of the Iberian economy. With the failure of both the Opus Dei and the Falange to win the hearts and minds of the council, the future of the Iberian economy has fallen to the Council's moderates, supported by Caudillo Salazar.\n\nThe Caudillos recently returned from a secretive business summit in the Algarve, the transcripts of their discussions not having been made public. From what information the press could discern, after hours of discussion with Iberia's most influential and powerful businessmen, the Caudillos have agreed to a moderate reform plan balancing the needs of various sectors. Most changes are aimed at expanding and continuing to protect Iberia's heavy industry, while gradually liberalizing most other sectors of the economy.\n\nToday, Caudillo Salazar stands before the podium and delivers a speech before the council. "Friends, councilors, and citizens of Iberia: In the past fifteen years our union has given its people an unprecedented standard of living, far healthier, happier, and wealthier than anyone could have imagined. Still, there is much work that remains to be done. I recently toured the northeastern areas of Portugal where I grew up. There I saw wheat fields, dry after only a few rainless days due to poor irrigation. I visited a once bountiful fig orchard which had been ruined by a beetle infestation. I visited a vineyard which had truly marvelous wine, but its grapes were smaller and fewer in number than those from Italian or French wineries. The problems facing Iberian agriculture speak to the problems affecting the economy as a whole. Though our economy is stable, growing, and among the largest in Europe, we have the potential to achieve even greater success. I stand before the Council today to announce Iberia's path forward, a path which will meet the needs of all Iberian industries as we march towards 1970. New government policies will be used to expand vital industry and promote trade both domestic and international. The tax code will be streamlined and rationalized, and emerging opportunities brought about by new technology will be explored.""

In this most recent battle, one of words and minds rather than guns and planes, he expected no different. Franco had long been a supporter of Autarky, and with the Spanish Caudillo's great influence Grandes and other Falangists could weave their way back into the highest echelons of political power. Franco gave his support, and so did the wealthy industrialists set to benefit most from autarky. Following prolonged discussions, Franco and Salazar announced they would sign a new economic plan drafted by the Falange with only minor modifications.\n\nAlberto Ullastres made an attempt to delay the proceedings. "Our economy is nearly stagnant! Corruption and trade restrictions are strangling our ability to grow and to compete with our rivals. We cannot enact a reform package so gigantic the day it is released! Caudillo Franco, we need further time to conduct a full review of how this plan will impact investment, manufacturing, and poverty rates." His voice was shaking, his desperation obvious to all in the room.\n\nGrandes interrupted, "Was it not the Falange that had predicted that the Spanish Republic would suppress its right-wing critics? Was it not the Falange that had saved the Spanish nation from liberalism, communism, and anarchism? Was it not the Falange that kept Iberia free from German or Italian domination? And was it not the Falange who highlighted the threat posed by regional separatists? So tell me, Señor Ullastres, why do you believe that the Falange ought not be in charge of economic policy?"\n\nUllastres was at a loss for words. Was Grandes trying to push forward a plan without even giving the Caudillos the time to read it in full?

When the council was established, Franco had offered Piñar a seat, and he accepted in spite of his opposition to the legislature's very existence. The Triumvirate had fallen apart, an inevitability in his eyes. Meager attempts at liberalization in previous years had failed to grow the economy as promised, and done everything to enable terrorists.\n\nAs the attention of the Council turned away from Constitutional matters, a war of words broke out between Reformists and Conservatives on the direction of the Iberian economy. The push by Piñar and his allies for a return to Falangist economics garnered considerable praise and voracious opposition both in the public and in the Council. Those calling for a gradual, moderate approach to economic policy reform quickly found themselves forced into either Reformist or Conservative camps. With Franco's heightened influence and endorsement of the Falangist plan, the hardliners of the council led by Piñar were reinvigorated.\n\nBlas Piñar's ideological struggle was one waged with backroom meetings and quiet bank transfers just as much as any noisy speech before the Council, but it was the vote today that would prove either his final victory or ultimate defeat.

He would be lying to himself if he claimed to have never imagined being Caudillo one day. Through the 1950s he had been among the most prominent politicians in Salazar's circle, and his inclusion in the Iberian Council was obvious. There he had made close personal connections to a variety of Spanish leaders, men like Manuel Fraga and even Caudillo Franco himself.\n\nAlong with Alberto Ullastres, he spearheaded the reforms to Seguridad Social that passed a few years ago, and he now hoped to work on other gradual reforms to Iberian policy. In the weeks leading to his appointment, he had his doubts whether Franco would select him, but trusted that his political connections and close friendship with the late Portuguese Caudillo would boost his chances.\n\nYesterday, Caetano was inaugurated as Portugal's new Caudillo. Today he would meet with the Council as Caudillo for the first time. It felt surreal walking into the same chamber as every other meeting, and taking a seat at the front of the chamber rather than his usual seat with the Portuguese ministers. The empty seat between Inocêncio Galvão Teles and Alberto Franco Nogueira spoke to just how much the situation had changed in so short a time.\n\nValcárcel called the council to order, and introduced Caetano to a council already well acquainted with him. Cheers, some more enthusiastic than others, echoed through the chamber. Even at this meeting, a meeting ostensibly dedicated to his inauguration, Franco spoke substantially more than Caetano, and Caetano substantially less than Salazar had at most prior meetings. This fact was not lost on anybody. On a day that Marcelo Caetano had hoped to showcase his willpower and capability, he instead appeared as little more than a lapdog for the Spanish Caudillo.

At the beginning of Salazar's tenure, fewer than 1 in 3 Portuguese children could read. Most elderly lived in destitution. One in seven infants would not live to see their first birthday. But under his wise and benevolent guidance, on the eve of the Iberian Union's founding, 3 in 4 children could read, all elderly citizens were provided pensions, and infant mortality had been cut in half. His bold initiatives as Caudillo of Iberia saw great reduction in poverty, have ensured that every single child is taught to read, and cut infant mortality in half once more. No man goes hungry in the streets. No child is denied their right to an education. Iberians live 10 years longer on average than they did a single generation ago.\n\nToday, our nation is left watching the ships, as we mourn the passing of one of the greatest leaders in living memory.

"The past few years have been marked by nothing if not conspiracy. Whether it was the CNT conspiring to occupy Barcelona or the ETA conspiring to rise up in Bilbao. Whether it was liberals trying to infiltrate our colleges or socialists trying to infiltrate our factories. Whether it was street partisans trying to destroy our government from without...\n...or councilors trying to destroy it from within.\nThe council failed to warn our intelligence services that anything was amiss in Catalonia, and soon Barcelona burst into flame. The Council has tried to usurp the powers of its Caudillos rather than aiding them, to transform the government rather than assist it. Our sacred Iberian Union will not be destroyed. Not by socialist terrorists on the streets, and certainly not by their allies in the bureaucracy. By personal decree, the Iberian Council is hereby disbanded."\n\nThe chamber was silent, with shock and terror. Even men who were opposed to the creation of the council were astounded to witness such a sudden and dramatic shift. Those who had hoped that the council may be used to push for reform were downright terrified to hear Franco compare them to the CNT. Was this the beginning of a purge? Forget their careers--were their very lives still secure?\n\nThe Portuguese ministers noticed something else. 'By personal decree.' Franco was not even acknowledging Caetano. Is this still the Iberian Union? Or has Franco merely conquered Portugal by pen stroke?"

 IBR.3131.t:0 "A Windy Morning in Madrid" #Legislative after choosing Democratic Iberia
 IBR.3131.d:0 "When Torcuato Fernández-Miranda had entered the Palace of the Cortes that morning, he had expected Valcárcel's speech to be one of a mundane, frankly routine nature. Even as the winds of change swept over Iberia and her government, nothing could have prepared him for the sudden announcement that Iberia would undergo a democratic transition. Hell, it would have been dramatic news had Valcárcel announced democracy was an aspirational goal to slowly build over the next decade, but within months? Fraga, along with hundreds of other people sitting in the Cortes, found it all hard to believe.\n\nIn the rest of his speech, Valcárcel outlined Iberia's need for a democratic transition, how its elections were to be organized, and the transitionary role of the Caudillos in this new system. Fraga did not really pay attention, still too stunned by the news. But ever so slowly, the world started to make sense again, and slowly Fraga became more and more excited. He stepped outside to take a deep breath. Perhaps it was the fresh air, or perhaps just getting outside, but that is when it really set in. After centuries of kings and queens and many decades of dictatorship, Spain and Portugal would be truly free.\n\n"Torcuato! Where the hell were you, we've been looking everywhere!" shouted an eager Alberto Ullastres, as he stepped outside himself. His smile was wide, like a young child on Christmas morning. He stepped toward Fernández-Miranda, embracing him and patting his back. "God damn. I never thought I'd see such a day."\n\nAlongside him was Manuel Fraga, the man who could claim more honestly than anyone else to be the lead architect of this new Iberian project. He had spoken with the Caudillos on numerous occasions, urging political reform as a necessary step to truly eliminate corruption and ensure a stable Iberian Union. Now he had succeeded, not with violent revolution or a destabilizing coup, but through peaceful reform. No longer would the masses cry out with rage for want of a voice in government. No longer would corrupt officials cling to power for lack of a means to remove them. The old Iberia was coming to an end, faster than he had ever dreamed."

After we were knocked down by the grievous attacks in Barcelona, we got back up and we broke the backs of the terrorists. Under the guidance of Caudillo Francisco Franco and Antonio Salazar, may he rest in peace, the council has put forth legislation that has greatly increased the quality of life for the average Iberian citizen and improved the ability of our government to function, that we may live up to the promise of our Union.\n\nToday, by joint decree of myself and Caudillo Franco, the Iberian council is hereby expanded. Its current 30 seats will be increased in number to 70, and its members shall be nominated by the council and appointed by a simple majority vote, subject to the final approval of the Caudillos. In addition to expanding the size of the council and the modifications to the nomination process, the council's authority will be extended to include oversight of governmental agencies, to better determine the proper allocation of funds and course of public policy."\n\nCaetano sat down, with Franco continuing the session. Cheers roared through the chamber with many councilors, particularly the more reformist members, overjoyed to hear of the expanded rights and responsibilities given to the council. But not all in the Iberian government were satisfied. Fernando Santos Costa, Portuguese Minister of War prior to Iberian unification, was fuming. Today represented a horrifying step in weakening the power of the Caudillos, and extending that of corruptible, impressionable bureaucrats. Civilian government grew more influential, and even if the number of seats given to military leadership was ostensibly increased, he knew well that its actual influence in the modified council would be diminished.\n\nRegardless, this was by no means a disaster for Iberia. Whether any given politician was a passionate supporter or bitter critic of the new reforms, it was far from the drastic overhaul of the governmental system that Iberia's most radical reformers had called for. The age of Iberian autocracy under Franco and Salazar was gone, replaced by one of authoritarian oligarchy."

Not only for the clouds looming above and the sun setting beneath the hills, but in the deafening silence of several reformists as they sat together in a small cafe. They had failed. Years of efforts to save Iberia, save its economy and save its people from destruction, had all been for nought. Iberian Democracy was stillborn, and its parents mourned their horrible loss.\n\nNeither Manuel Fraga nor Alberto Ullastres could deny that the dream of a politically and economically liberal Iberia was dead. Fraga's feelings on the matter were complicated, to say the least. He had always seen himself as a pragmatic conservative more than an idealistic reformer. The state may not be free, but there are always improvements to be made.\n\nUllastres had always been an advocate for the rights of the Iberian people to healthy, happy, and well-educated lives. Democracy was supposed to be the vessel to bring real change to Iberia. Without it, the masses could hardly hope to protect themselves from the regime's corruption and incompetence. He would remain on the council, working together with Fraga as a vocal advocate of economic liberalization, but it had been a painful loss indeed.\n\nTorcuato Fernández-Miranda, Minister-Secretary of the Movimiento Nacional, had been one of the longest serving Ministers of Franco's Spain, and had recently emerged as one of the best known and most powerful voices in the council. His famous ability to negotiate and converse with conservative and falangist leaders had been essential in ensuring that his ambitious reforms passed. But now, he was defeated. His political career was over. He knew it. Fraga and Ullastres knew it. His pained expression and stiff body made his feelings obvious, but he knew as well as anyone else that no amount of passion could save his life's work.\n\nA week later, Fernández-Miranda resigned his position. He returned to Asturias, where he had grown up, purchasing a modest estate in which he planned to spend his remaining years. The position of Minister-Secretary of the Movimiento Nacional now fell to Jose Utrera Molina, a Falangist fanatically devoted to Caudillo Franco. Whatever chance there was of a peaceful transition to Democracy, it had now been snuffed out."

 IBR.3134.d:0 "It had taken months to arrange this meeting. Not since the Civil War had leaders of the Spanish Socialist Worker's Party, General Union of Workers, Syndicalist Party, and Basque Nationalist Party, all been together in the same room. This would be an uneasy meeting, to say the least. Ideological divides threatened any hope at a united opposition.\n\nNine men sat at a quiet private residence in Belem, Brazil. 4 were Iberian dissidents that had been quietly smuggled out of Cadiz. The others were exiles, 3 Portuguese and 2 Spanish, that had not seen Iberia in many years. All saw the rising discontent that had created Iberia's terrorist movements as an opportunity for reform.\n\nThe tension in the room slowly dissipated as the men discussed which content to include in their manifesto. Democratic rights and the legalization of opposition parties were obvious. But were there any parties too extreme to legalize? Should the Iberian Union be dissolved or maintained? Should the culturally distinct regions of Iberia be granted full autonomy?\n\nTo many of the underground dissidents in Iberia, the Belem Manifesto was hardly inspirational. It was too vague in its goals and too unclear in how they hoped to achieve them, and it tried to ignore the obvious question of whether Iberia should be a socialist state. But others saw something else: A consensus between Liberal and Leftist activists in Iberia, whose differences had previously prevented cooperation. Its calls for increasing the rights of workers to organize and working to improve the wellbeing of citizens through increased state intervention, struck a compromise between the calls for revolution and the call for more limited reform."

Indeed, his friend had been arrested by Salazar's goons more than once.\n\nSitting to his left, and cleaning his glasses, the third man, a Sevillian, gave a nod of agreement before laughing at his joke. "Look, I am a Marxist at heart, but we can't ignore reality. What we need is a party like what they have in the United States, what's his name... Harrington."\n\nAll three nod in cynical agreement. "I think we could just get something like that here, hell, the church might even like it."\n\nThe Portuguese in the group decided to retort.

It was far better to remember the old man for their games of chess, rather than by their many arguments over Iberian policy.\n\nFranco took some time to make one last examination of the chess board. It was a plain, uninteresting design - white-and-black pieces on a white-and-black board; he had set it up at the Portuguese Caudillo's preferred table one final time.

Shouts and screams of terror only added to the deathly cacophony.\n\n"Somebody see to him, he is choking, quick!" came a cry from across the table. Several aides heeded the call and rushed to dislodge whatever was caught in their leaders' throat. Yet, try as they may, not one of them could stem the coughing. It soon became clear that it was something far more serious; not that any of those present were willing to admit it. Eventually it all ended; the dreadful whooping faded into a whimper, and the old man rolled backward. He gasped until his lungs were filled with air, and relaxed his arms, bringing his hands away from his face. However, once he could summon the strength to open his eyes the fierce dread flooded back into him. His hands were wet with his own blood. The man could not hold off his fears any longer, he had to get out, he had to get help.\n\nAs he exited, he was followed by his advisors, who nervously expected the worse for Franco.

 IBR.3149.d:0 "Maria Francisca de Almeida played with her doll in the mud. Mariquita Pérez had been her favorite ever since it was given to her last Christmas. Mariquita was digging a hole looking for buried treasure, but large clouds loomed overhead. Shortly before sunset, the sky turned dark, and a slow trickle of rain began to fill Mariquita's hole with water. Disappointed but not overly upset, Francisca went back inside. Her mother, Maria Gabriela Pachecho, was exasperated to see her daughter's homemade dress completely soiled. Francisa's mother pulled off her dress and caned her buttocks. Gabriela now had to worry about a crying child and a dress to handwash in addition to all her other responsibilities. Her husband Carlos returned from work reeking of the sardines he had canned. As the family tried to rest that night, a crack of thunder startled young Luís awake, his wailing waking his mother. Gabriela sat up to cradle the infant, and that's when she felt it.\n\nWater. Warm, moving water. At least an inch, maybe more. She laid Luís down on her bed as she rushed to turn on the light and jolt her husband awake. "Carlos! Carlos! Wake up, oh darn it!" her husband, groggy and confused, struggled to gain his bearings. "The house is flooded!" Food debris floated through the kitchen and seeped into the pantry. The bathroom door creaked as slight shifts in the water pulled it about. The power went out. Gabriela could not see anything. "Carlos! Grab the kids, we need to get out!"\n\n"What are you doing dad? Where are we going?" shouted a confused and terrified Francisca, as they evacuated. Intense rain left all four soaked and both children crying, as their parents tried to walk up a muddy road to reach higher ground. She heard a cracking sound. A loud crash of tearing wood and crushed furniture marked the collapse of her household."

We can organize emergency grain and medical shipments, send in personnel from other cities, and evacuate the injured ."\n\n"I appreciate the sentiment, but we don't even know how many injured there are, or what shape the roads are in. Sending a bunch of grain trucks could congest the roads and block medical evacuation to supply unwanted grain, for all we know. I governed from Lisbon for decades.

The windows of the market where Maria Gabriela Pachecho once shopped were now broken, not by water but by blunt force. The food was gone, seized by hordes of thieves and the desperately hungry. Twice, today, disheveled strangers had offered her family bread rolls at offensively high prices.\n\nBut even as some men broke into markets to steal food and sell it at far higher price to the desperately hungry, others worked to distribute that food for free. Dozens of university students had quickly organized an effort to bake and distribute bread across the city, offering grain to several people--mostly women--who offered to produce bread themselves. Young adults, teenagers, and even some children as young as 12, were tasked by these volunteers with distributing bread.\n\nA clothing store offered much of its inventory to those lacking clothes, so that they may be better protected from the elements. And many men, whether out of a sense of duty or simply boredom, began to pull rubble from the streets, tossing it into empty alleys or ruined buildings to allow vehicles into the city. Some vehicles were from the government, but at least as many were individuals bringing their own supplies from the cities not hit by the flooding.\n\nThese volunteer efforts are clearly positive, and signal the resilience of the people of Lisbon.

All quite heavy, and now stuck just a few kilometers from their destination. It would take several more hours for additional crew to arrive to unload the supplies and haul them on foot.\n\nWhen he finally reached the camp hastily erected on a college campus, he was hit with the stench of mud, mildew, and unwashed bodies. The people in this camp were not malnourished, but they were tired, thirsty, and shivering in the cold as December arrived. Rui could hear their murmuring as he and his fellow officers unpacked supplies.

Thousands still lived in outdoor camps, unpleasant even on a "good" day, with little protection from rain and even less from the cold weather. Now, Rui helped evacuees place tarps on the bottom of their tents, so that they would not have to sleep on the bare ground. Towels, so they could dry off, and blankets, so that they could sleep more comfortably.\n\nA four-seat vehicle parked outside the campsite. Rui watched a man step out, perhaps 50 years old, and begin running towards the evacuees "Luiza! Are you here?" From the crowd emerged a woman and her daughter, clearly relieved to see the man.\n\n"Papai!" Luiza shouted, embracing the man. Like many others Luiza had been left homeless by the flood, but now her father had come to bring his daughter to live with him at her childhood home in Coimbra.

However, the shelters are still no substitute for real housing. The food is bad, the bedding is stiff and uncomfortable, there is virtually no privacy, theft is common, and worst of all, multiple incidents of rape and molestation have been reported. It will take time for the city to rebuild, and unfortunately, these shelters are the only place many Lisboans are able to live.\n\nThe emergency fund used to construct the shelters will run out in a few days.

Most buildings have either been repaired or demolished, and the scars of the destruction are fading quickly.\n\nWhile the housing situation improves rapidly, the recovery of employment has stagnated. Businesses suffered severely, with many factories and stores alike being badly damaged or destroyed entirely. Local government officials have been ineffective at preventing, and at times have even been complicit in, predatory lending that has forced business owners to choose between losing their businesses, or having their businesses weighed down by interest for years to come. Lacking any source of income, thousands of Lisboans now rely almost exclusively on government support to survive.\n\nFew doubt that Lisbon's economy will eventually recover, but even fewer deny that the current situation remains poor.

He was not making as much as he did at the cannery, but really, he was just happy to have a job at all. The weeks after the Flood had been hard, but even with his old job, old car, and old house gone, life was starting to feel normal again. Just the knowledge that his work might prevent future floods greatly motivated him, and gave him some sense of purpose. Sunset signaled the end of a productive workday. If only he still had a vehicle of his own, so that he did not have to walk a mile back from work. And if only the elevator were not broken, so that he did not have to climb three flights of stairs to reach his apartment.\n\n"Papai! Papai!" shouted his exuberant daughter. "Mom got me a new Mariquita!" Carlos exchanged a knowing glance with his wife. On some days, little Maria Francisca seemed to have been more heartbroken by the loss of her doll in the flood than the loss of their home. His work had paid off, his family had recovered yet another piece of their old lives.\n\n"She's been yapping about that thing all evening!" exclaimed his jovial roommate, embracing Carlos and patting him on the back. "You do good work." That was one of the unusual things about life after the flood. With so many homes destroyed, it was now common for individual apartments to be rented to multiple families. But Vítor was a pleasant man, someone who genuinely enjoyed the company of Carlos and his family. Carlos could once again listen to the same radio shows he did at his old house with his daughter.

That Senhor Gusmão was such a miserable man. It was better than the camp, at least.\n\nHer husband Carlos came through the door, smelling of the sea. "I might just strangle him some day." Gabriela chuckled. Her husband's dry humor was one of the few joys in life that the flood had not destroyed. "If the power comes back on, I have mackerel for us to share."\n\n"One of these days, can you reel in a drink instead?" Carlos smiled and sat next to his wife, wrapping his arm around her and leaning into her body.\n\nLife had not been so good after the flood. Gabriela often found herself wishing she were still a child, not having to worry about the awful apartment, and not knowing the pain of losing a home.

He sat beside his wife Gabriela, in a shack that creaked with every strong gust of wind. Carlos was terrified that he had made a mistake while building it, and the roof would collapse onto them. At least here, he could keep some semblance of his dignity. Not long ago, Carlos could rely on a steady wage from his job at the cannery. Now, he helped neighbors build their own shacks in return for cigarettes or food. And what cigarettes he did not smoke, he could trade those for more food.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Maria Francisca de Almeida lost her home. She lay in the shack with her parents, exhausted as she often was, and sleeping at an hour she once had been filled with energy. She wet the bed again, to her mother's dismay. It had not been a problem before the flood. Now, there was scarcely a night it did not happen. Once, Francisca was filled with joy, and a thirst for adventure and new experiences. Now, she hardly ever left her mother's side.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Luís Maria de Almeida lost his home. In a way, his parents envied him. Too young to realize just how much he had lost.

What could have been done to prevent such a horrible flood? Is Iberia doing enough now to make sure such a thing never happens again?\n\nLisbon comes back to life, returning to its place as Europe's westernmost great city. But it is forever changed.

As the papers will have you know, we have been in the thick of the fighting recently but rest assured, I'm still safe and sound. Which is more than I can say for many others. The Germans, and their Boer allies, are a much different breed of soldier compared to the natives and Italians we faced in Algeria. More motivated and better disciplined.\n\nWe had the last laugh though, rumor has it the Germans didn't expect much from a bunch of "Mediterraneans". What they didn't count on was Spanish and Portuguese discipline, bravery... and the Americans. Efficient, disciplined, and lavishly well-equipped, they are a formidable foe on any battlefield, and I'm glad they're on our side.\n\nI can't tell you where I am, and given how often we're on the move I'm not quite sure I know either. We sometimes set up in towns, often we are in the field, but the weather is friendly, and we're well supplied. Far better than Algeria. The people too are different, the natives are suspicious but not hostile and we can get along with them well. The Boers however, looked on us with hostility and disdain. They stare at you sullenly, insolently, or just look the other way.\n\nIt is a tragedy to see such a beautiful country be spoiled by war, but increasingly I'm unsure of our presence here.

As the coasts of Algeria disappeared into the distance, the man wondered how much his birthplace had changed since he last saw it.\n\nPortugal was but a distant memory, a home he had left to pursue life overseas, lured away by promises of fame and fortune. First came Angola, a harsh exotic land. He had earned his living hacking roads from the jungle, carving plantations from the wilderness, and bringing civilization to an untamed continent. Until the Germans marched in and forced them out, while Lisbon stood by and watched.\n\nThen came Algeria, where he worked alongside his Spanish brethren, carving a place for himself and his fellow exiles, the Retornados. The desert was a harsh mistress, but he had managed until the War came and went, and he was once again without a land to call home.\n\nThe hours passed quickly, few of his fellow Retornados were in the mood to talk, hushed voices and whispered words, worried parents, and confused children. The only ones willing to speak were the soldiers, young, angry, and resentful, with too much to drink and too little to do.\n\nAs the coast of Portugal came into view, António didn't know what to feel.

However, this prediction was proven wrong when three SAM batteries were destroyed by gunfire from the Battleship Vittorio Veneto, and leaflets demanding the island's surrender were dropped by the Regia Aeronautica.\n\nGeneral Gutiérrez-Mellado, the brigadier in charge of Majorca's defenses, decided to fight. The first reports of combat between the two former allies came when troops from the Sardegna division that had invaded Paguera were met with stiff resistance by the 8th Federal Artillery Battalion, made up of stranded Portuguese troops. Although the initial assault was halted, the landing of an Italian tank company soon forced the Iberians back to Galatzó. Gutiérrez-Mellado ordered his own armor reserves to the front, but these were destroyed by air attacks.\n\nAfter a simultaneous Iberian attempt to recover the airport was defeated, it became clear that with more Italians entering Palma by air and the road from the west open to the Regio Esercito's tanks, any further loss of life was futile. Mellado signed an armistice with the Italians at 12:00 and was interned with the island's 3,000 defenders.

Any attempts by our negotiating team to feel out where they stand having been met with vague statements\n\nStill, the experience was not all-together a negative one. Our diplomats were able to see the grandeur of Germania and were wined and dined by German high society, many of whom have expressed interest in visiting Iberia's beaches or inquiring about possible investments.

All the furniture had been moved in, the lighting installed; the only thing left was the portraits, Iberia's two Caudillos.\n\n"No, no, no, that won't do. They are supposed to be equals. They need to both be on the same level." The man was already adjusting the portraits, moving Franco's likeness slightly upwards. His supervisor was silent, something still did not look right. As he was reaching to clear his spectacles, it hit him.\n\n"Why is Salazar to the right? Portugal is to the left of Spain, so shouldn't Salazar's portrait be to the left of Franco." The other man paused, mulling over the words. Taking a step back, he let his superior do the honors in shifting Salazar's portrait. Both men studied the new arrangement, and both came to a similar conclusion.\n\n"It still looks off somehow, like one is lording over the other, should they even be on the same wall?" The man turned to face the supervisor, whose look of realization and exasperation spoke a million words.\n\n"They aren't even the same frame for crying out loud." He gestured at the portraits, and after a careful examination, the man recognized that yes, Salazar's frame was of a slightly different make then Franco's.

After all, what was the purpose of Iberia furnishing separate embassy buildings for nations like Tibet, Mongolia, or Bhutan? Countries that Foreign Ministry communicated with once in a blue moon, if at all. It was just his luck that he was saddled with the task of breaking the news. Mentally preparing himself for the next few hours, he greeted the delegations as they filed into the conference room.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, the Foreign Ministry regrets to inform you that given the lack of mutual relations or diplomatic exchange between our respective nations, the Ministry has decided to shift your embassies into a single building. While the specifics of this move have not yet been decided upon, we have opted to inform the affected delegations beforehand.

The revolutions of the 1910s, the blackouts and civil defense exercises of the 2nd World War, or the "Atomic Panic'' that had spread like wildfire during the seizure of the Ultramar had all left their mark on the ancient capital. The best one could say was that the past decade had been less harsh then rest, that the formation of the Iberian Union had at least produced a sense of security, bringing with it some measure of prosperity.\n\nThe parade of the Iberian Armed Forces was attended by nearly all. Whether out of respect for its Caudillo, pride in Union, or merely an excuse to take the day off, Lisbon's streets were filled with onlookers nonetheless. It would be at noon when the men of Iberia began their marching through the city's streets. At its forefront were the Colonial units, the Fuerzas Regulares Indígenas, and the Spanish Legion, self-assured and exuding confidence. Next up were the mechanized units of the Federal Army, foreign-made designs alongside domestic vehicles trailed behind the Legion on the route to Baixa, their attached infantry following in neatly ordered rows. In the rear was the Home Guard, Portugal's sons keeping pace with the finest of the Iberian Army.\n\nThe march would last for over an hour before they arrived at the city center, pausing for prepared speeches from both Caudillos, extolling the virtues and bravery of the Iberian soldier. The people cheered, of course, Salazar was still Lisbon's favorite son and Franco, well respect the position if not the man. The parade then continued towards the shore, where it concluded with a 21-gun salute by the ships in the harbor, an acrobatic display by the Air force, and a few final remarks from the dual heads of state."

 IBR.3166.d:0 "Though a charismatic man in public, in private Antonio de Oliveira Salazar had always been an introverted and at times reclusive man. He never married and had no children. When he was not meeting with Franco or other politicians, he was usually alone in his residence, what prior to the Iberian unification was the Portuguese Embassy in Madrid. His maid María de Jesus, a woman too enamored with Salazar to leave his side despite knowing the Caudillo did not feel the same way about her as she did him, was his only close friend. While Salazar read a book in his study, María spotted up the bathroom in anticipation of guests.\n\nThis was a special occasion for the Caudillo. His older sister, Maria do Resgate Salazar de Oliveira, was visiting today, for the first time in four years. Salazar liked few people and trusted even fewer, but he never doubted his sisters. The Caudillo answered the door, greeting his sister and her three daughters with warm embraces. Gosh, they had grown old. To think, his sister was now a frail old woman of 80. His nieces had grey hair, and much more prominent wrinkles than the last time they met. What lovely years they had spent together.\n\nAs they sat together in the living room, and a pause appeared in the conversation, one of his niece's eyes lit up. "Antonio, I don't think I remembered to tell you."\n\n"Yes?"\n\n"Antonia is pregnant! And I think you're going to be a great granduncle.""

Who was Americo to doubt its security?\n\nFranco could be terribly obstinate at times, but this? This was just stupid, it would be the first time in Iberia's history that the two Caudillos simultaneously left the peninsula. Tomás tried to hide his annoyance. "My Caudillo, with all due respect, you are a mortal man, and even if the chance of anything going wrong is slim, all Iberia could be destroyed if something does. We are sending bodyguards with you, and they will remain with you at all times. The same goes for Caudillo Salazar."\n\n"Look, I don't want some, some ass-. Excuse me.

 IBR.3168.d:0 "Francisco Franco's magnificent 47-meter yacht cruised through Atlantic waters. This was a vacation of sorts, a few days to spend away from governing before the Malta Conference. No trip out to sea, thought Franco, would be complete without a great catch to commemorate the voyage. The Bay of Biscay had long been a hunting ground for whalers. Its deep undersea canyons provided a home for deep-divers, while fertile reefs provided for the shallow-sea-whales. And Franco would keep searching the bay until he found one.\n\nHours passed, and the sky turned orange as the sun neared the horizon. The wind was still and the water clear. Droplets of water sprayed in the distance, and for but a few seconds the back of an enormous sperm whale rose above the surface. "Arteaga! Maximum power!" As the yacht turned towards the beast its motor roared to life and raced forward. Rapid clicks, each as loud as shotgun blasts, had most sailors covering their ears. Not Franco. He had insisted: He would operate the harpoon, and he would not allow size, speed, or sound, to stop him. He rigs the weapon. Now just a matter of aiming. Good, she does not expect a thing, just hold still...\n\nBOOM\n\nThe explosive attached to the harpoon detonates, blasting water and chunks of flesh into the air, and turning the surrounding water red. The whale thrashed around, but it only worsened the bleeding. Franco now joined his men at the ropes, dragging the monster aboard as it made its final feeble movements. 10 meters long, and God only knows how many tons."

 #The Inspector Chain

 IBR.3169.t:0 "A New Case" 
 IBR.3169.d:0 "Small pebbles were thrown up as the police car rushed along the winding cobbled road which separated the outskirts of Valladolid from their destination. Observing the dancing shadows in the trees created by the headlights the inspector scoffed. Separating the estate from the edge of civilization more like. Quietly laughing at his own joke he noticed that the driver was looking at him through the car mirror.\n\n"Is everything okay sir?"\n\nSurprised at the genuine sound of concern laced into the question the inspector turned to face his colleague. "I was just thinking what a pathetic case this likely will be."\n\nThe inspector could see both disgust and surprise in the sergeants eyes. "How so? A young girl from a noble family has been reported missing!"\n\n"The social status of the family does not exceed the class of provincial nobility." Following this reply the sergeant raised his eyebrows questioningly while the inspector continued unabashed. "She likely ran away. Responsibility associated with being the eldest daughter, maintaining social etiquette, having no real free choice..." He could see the sergeant briefly nodding, but the rest of the journey was dominated by a leering silence.\n\nThe car was greeted formally as if the policemen were distinguished guests. Following a brief and fruitless discussion with the attending family members, the inspector went to search the house. Noticing no signs of forced entry or other indications of violent crime he tasked the sergeant with questioning the servants. After only two interviews the sergeant rushed back to the inspector.\n\n"Maybe you were right. It seems the daughter was close to one particular servant who also has not returned to work for a few days."\n\nThe inspector smiled weakly. He may have sated his ego but the girl was still missing."
 IBR.3169.a:0 "An opportunity to make a name for himself."
 
 IBR.3170.t:0 "Dead End" 
 IBR.3170.d:0 "For a simple case, the paperwork seemed to tower a little too high on the inspector's desk. Neither the missing girl nor the servant have been found, an embarrassment to the Valladolid Municipal Police. Looking at a particularly big pile of paper he sighed. Grabbing it he strode purposefully to the sergeant's desk who had accompanied him on the night of the investigation. He dropped the batch with a playful wink and continued past the seething officer towards an entirely different animal. Bracing himself he opened the glass paneled door to his superiors office.\n\n"Ah inspector great timing, I was just about to send my secretary. I have been receiving some rather pressing calls from the missing girl's family. Have you gotten any further with the case?" The overweight man sat in the far side of the room and observed the entrant with an unconcealed fury. Clearly he already knew the answer.\n\n"No sir." replied the inspector quietly.\n\n"That certainly is a terrible shame. The trouble is I cannot justify such high funding for the investigation anymore if this is the case."\n\nFor a moment the inspector's vision was clouded by a red mist as his body fell into the welcoming abyss of fury. "How do you expect me to produce any results? Do you even know how many people I have had to question and how much paperwork this case requires? You sit here making demands while I am trying to find two missing people!"\n\nThe fat man's fury finally erupted as he heaved his great body forward in his chair. "You have the audacity to stand up to your superiors decision making? Who do you think you are? You owe me your position. Go home and come back tomorrow with a different attitude or you do not have to ever come back to work again."\n\nWith this he shooed the inspector out of his office and reached for black phone sat at the corner of his desk.\n\n"I need you to open a behavioral observation file on someone."" 
 IBR.3170.a:0 "There was much work to be done."

 IBR.3171.t:0 "Barcelona or Bust" 
 IBR.3171.d:0 "The Sword of Damocles perilously balanced over the inspector's head since the start of the investigation and was now beginning to swing dangerously. His return to the office had been an awkward affair. The inspector ensured his time away had not been wasted; he managed to get a thorough profile of the servant. In this he finally had found a key lead, the man seemed to know a group of anarchists in Barcelona rather well. Upon his return, his colleagues, some of them friends, had watched suspiciously as the inspector paced towards his desk. Shifting a stack of forms away to create a clear space, he noticed a small piece of paper which instantly made his blood boil. The case was to be dismissed unless new leads were procured. Subduing his anger, he again thought of the servant and an idea began to materialize.\n\nThe lazy sun illuminated the streets of the great Catalonian city. The inspector had tracked the cell to a mediocre family restaurant in the old part of town. Entering, he worriedly observed how a giant of a man made his way towards him from the back of the room. Towering over the inspector he asked him for the time. The inspector nervously hunched over to look at his watch, instead accidently dropping his police badge. Both men looked at the floor and then back at each other. Without saying another word the man hit him square in the face.\n\nOnly with luck was he able to escape the brutal beating he had to endure in the shop, only to return to his superior grilling him back at the hospital. Spacing in and out of the meeting he caught a few snippets of the conversation. He had broken protocol and this time had been one step too far. One word he distinctly caught, however: fired. Even with the anesthesia he managed a weak smile and one last lucid though: how lucky it was that he had left his files at home."
 IBR.3171.a:0 "He knew he would redeem himself."
 
 IBR.3172.t:0 "Broken House" 
 IBR.3172.d:0 "With each waking second the inspector could feel the dark bags under his eyes weigh him down more and more, as if they had been attached invisible weights. Staring up blankly he noticed his trusty desk lamp was faring no better than him; the three dead bulbs tumbled underneath already had varying layers of dust collecting on them. Sighing he leaned back to fully take in the chaos in front of him. The case papers seemed to have multiplied exponentially with his investigative work since the dismissal. Yet the solution was no closer, and it was infuriating him to no end.\n\nLooking at the photo of the missing heiress he felt a sudden chill as he imagined her calling out his name. He squinted hard at the picture only to notice the calls had come from behind him. His wife was in the doorway with a face of stone. Tick. Giving her sparsely any attention he turned back to his work. Tick. He could hear the thudding steps as she was coming closer, accusing him with every step. Tick. It did not sound real, his body felt so light he could have begun to float. Tick. As she drew nearer, he began to make out the harsh words that were spewing from her frightfully contorted face. Tick. Anger began to wash over the inspector, first the case, then the work incident and now finally his wife; it seemed nothing was willing to give him a break. Tick. As she grabbed his shoulder, he turned towards her with an expression of utter madness. Boom. The smack was sudden and without mercy, the inspector's wife stepped back reeling and clutching her reddened cheek with a look of abject horror on her face. Suddenly the world came back into focus. The inspector looked at his hand in disbelief as if it were a foreign body entirely alien to him. Across the room, now retreating slowly away from him, the same look was mirrored back. Yet it was not directed at his hand but his whole being. A quiet apology slipped loosely out of the inspector's mouth but as soon as it departed from his lips, he knew it would not be enough. He turned back to his work as the door to his study slammed shut. Not long after he heard the front door violently close. The case papers still lay on his desk."
 IBR.3172.a:0 ""Will they save me?""

 IBR.3173.t:0 "The Bottom" 
 IBR.3173.d:0 "The months after the fateful altercation in the inspector's study had been a blur. Each day he lost himself in the case as parts of his personal life quickly began to fall away. With no consistent stream of income, it came as no surprise that his house in Eastern Valladolid was soon repossessed. No less by the local bank, to which the inspector had been a loyal customer for many years. He would never forget the excitement in the clerk's eyes as he brought in the deed. The inspector had briefly searched for clues to where his wife had gone only to find the same results he had been getting with his case. He had felt a harsh jab upon this realization, something which slowly died away as he continued with his work. It had not taken long for him to find a new base of operations: his old school friend's house. The inspector had been lucky, the newlywed couple had two spare rooms prepared for when the house would become lively with the cries of children.\n\nSitting at his new desk he noticed a letter balanced on top of his case files. One quick tear and he saw the dreaded word he had prepared himself for: divorce. It should have been obvious, no one could get a legal divorce in Iberia. She had travelled abroad. The letter dug deep into his chest, past the ribcage and lungs straight into his heart. A new husband, far away in the distant former colonial lands of Venezuela. A job she finally was enjoying. His eyes began to blur as he read the next sentence. A child, not yet born, but soon to enrich the newly formed family's lives. Streams ran down his unshaven face, pooling on the case files in front of him. The inspector continued reading and soon his despair turned into white-hot rage. She was offering him a job at her new husband's steel factory. Did she feel sorry for him? Did she not realize the importance of his task? He grabbed a lighter and cigarette out of his pocket. With a swift movement he lit both the tobacco and letter. Throwing the burning mess out of the window in front of him he again returned to the case files in front of him. Nothing mattered now, only the case."
 IBR.3173.a:0 "There was nothing else left."

 IBR.3174.t:0 "Purifying Flame"
 IBR.3174.d:0 "The inspector's growing desperation had driven him to bribe some of his former colleagues to give him information on the case which the Valladolid Municipal Police had uncovered after his dismissal. With glee he received the news that the anarchists he had tracked and failed to properly confront in Barcelona had relocated to Asturias.\n\nThe night was still young with a half-moon slowly making its way across the dull night sky, yet the few streetlights failed to dispel the near darkness of the road where the hideout was located. With no security cameras installed no one noticed the dark shape dash around the house's exterior. A triple knock at the back door interrupted a particularly intense poker game between the two anarchists inside. Hunkering over to the door, the larger of the two turned back to his friend to complain about the last hand. Turning back, he looked into the shining eyes of a man filled with mad desperation, holding a wooden bat in one hand and a gas can in the other. The inspector managed to quickly subdue both men using the element of surprise, tying them to their chairs. Not willing to wait for other arrivals he woke them both ruthlessly with an ice-cold bucket of water and began his interrogation. When both men initially stayed silent, the inspector retorted by merrily pouring gasoline over the floor and furniture of the room. Soon the men began to talk. The servant had been a member of their group working undercover at the noble family, but had cut ties with the group back in Barcelona.\n\nBefore the men could tell him where the pair had hidden the back door opened again, this time revealing a group of surprised anarchists who took a moment to take in the scene in front of them. As the men finally dashed forward to free their comrades, the inspector drew his light and told them to stop. When they did not, he ran to the door and threw the lighter back inside. He heard violent screams and curses behind him being drowned out by the roaring of excited flames as he ran down the street. Turning for a brief moment he saw that all men had made it out and had given chase to him. He continued to run even after he had lost his pursuers. His legs carried him until he could run no further, collapsing on the ground he buried his face in his hands as he first began to hysterically laugh, shortly replaced by bitter tears."
 IBR.3174.a:0 "How far could this go?"

 IBR.3175.t:0 "A New Beginning" 
 IBR.3175.d:0 "Finally, the puzzle pieces were beginning to fall into place. A dissatisfied heiress of a minor noble family with no formal way of escaping her trapped existence, a former anarchist who had replaced the trappings of ideology with those of love and finally a group of relocating freedom fighters. Initially the ultimate question remained even with the acquisition of the anarchist's testimonies. He confirmed that the servant worked undercover for the anarchist cell while he worked for the noble family. But where were they? Had the pair moved with the cell to Asturias? Had they been hidden somewhere else entirely? If they had met with the anarchists in Barcelona why would they have continued moving further once the servant had left the organization, as the anarchist relayed during his interrogation?\n\nIt already put a great distance between the former reality the two wanted to escape. The inspector began to look through his files again, this time taking great pains to pursue the money which had been withdrawn multiple times from the girl's account. He took note of a particularly large and out of place sum, and moved his attention towards gaining a better insight into the property market of Barcelona.\n\nAfter months of anonymous calls and information perusal he finally had triangulated a small apartment which seemed to match both the time frame and withdrawal amount. He had found them."
 IBR.3175.a:0 "A chance at redemption?"

 IBR.3176.t:0 "Closure" 
 IBR.3176.d:0 "Unable to control his emotions the inspector sat in front of the files, in a house not even his own, and began to cry uncontrollably and bitterly. This case had taken everything from him. Everything he had ever held dear. His wife, his home, his job, his friends, and his pride. Now it was over, before him lay the address he had tracked the missing pair to. A small flat in Barcelona, nothing befitting a wealthy heiress, but he was sure it was a happy home, nonetheless. Picking up the receiver of the phone next to him he briefly stalled. Many thoughts crossed his troubled mind as he carefully considered his next action. With a grim determination he however finally entered the number he knew he needed to call. A chirpy voice answered on the other end informing the inspector that he was indeed speaking to the Municipal Police of Valladolid and then asked what it was he was calling about. Ensuring not to mention his name the inspector gave the information he had now worked years to obtain. All he could manage after the call was a long sigh.\n\nNot even an hour later the phone rang again waking the inspector out of his daze. With a jolt he sat up as he unmistakably recognized the voice of his old sergeant. What surprised him more however was what the man said next.\n\n"We want you back.""
 IBR.3176.a:0 ""Gladly, sir.""

 IBR.3177.t:0 "An End After All"
 IBR.3177.d:0 "Lying on the small unmade bed of his temporary home the inspector heard a quiet and cautious knock at the old door. Standing up he quickly straightened his clothes and went to greet his friend. With a pleasant smile devoid of any of the pity the inspector had become accustomed to over the past months his friend passed him a bulky package. Both men looked eagerly inside as the inspector began to tear at the envelope.\n\nA newspaper of the current day and a letter. Folding out the newspaper the inspector's eyes were quickly drawn to a red circle around a small article nearly hidden at the bottom of the page. With slightly raised eyebrows he read that the couple he had searched for so long had indeed been found in the place where he had traced them to. There however was no mention of the anonymous tip he had left, instead all the praise was laid at the feet of a former sergeant who now had been honorably promoted. Smirking sadly, he tossed the paper away to look at the letter. Instantly taken aback, he saw that it was from his former superior. The department knew that his work had been important in resolving the case. His old boss stressed that he had always known that the inspector would be able to resolve this terrible ordeal. Considering the current political climate and the serious breaches the inspector had committed he would not be able to regain his position on the force. The next part made the inspector draw in his breath shakily while the grin on his friend's face grew even wider. He would be rewarded with an attached check of 100 thousand pesetas, enough to help him start a new life. Unable to comprehend what he had just read he let the papers slip out of sweating hands.\n\nAs he stepped back the envelope spilled the last of its contents: the check and a one way bus ticket to Lisbon."

He was alone on the street as all normal folk had decided to hole themselves up comfortably inside. Resolved as he was, however, he stormed towards the public phone box.\n\nInside he violently grabbed the receiver and was about to dial the number of the Valladolid police as he saw a strange happening outside in the rain. A couple, drawn closely together to escape the storm's fury, marched hastily past the box only for the woman to drop her purse in the gutter. Without so much as a second thought the man had leant down to fetch it back, in the process greatly muddying his wet clothes. The women gave him a peck on the cheek as they hastily continued along their way. Watching them for a few moments the inspector's mind began to race with new doubts.\n\nNoticing that the hand holding the receiver was shaking uncontrollably he gripped it with his other hand, only then noticing that it was not only water now streaming down his face. Redialing he began to think of nicer weather as a voice on the other side of the line began to speak. "South American Dreams travel agency, how may I help you?""

Working with those he had too, discarding those he did not. He had been steadily rising through the ranks, and within a few years he might have even made it to Madrid. He scoffed, it was all a pipedream now.\n\nThe Carnation revolution had toppled the government, sweeping into the power the weak-willed democrats and reformists with their misguided ideals.

Fernández Miranda, Alberto Ullastres, and dozens of other long-serving reformists gave stirring speeches, occasionally even a lone voice or two of dissent emerged in the chamber.\n\nNothing came of it.

 IBR.3183.t:0 "The King of Football" 
 IBR.3183.d:0 ""To Paco Gento," proclaimed Jaime, and the trio downed their cañas of beer. "The best footballer this country has ever known." he added. His friends scoffed, as he knew they would. He'd just reignited that old debate, waged in every bar, café and schoolyard across Iberia.\n\n"Jaime! Pal. I know the man's just retired, but you don't have to exaggerate," said Juan. "Gento was good, no doubt. But Ricardo Zamora was El Divino! There won't ever be a star like him". He pointed at Pepe, the third member of the group, as he popped an olive in his mouth. "And you, don't you dare bring up Peyroteo".\n\nPepe laughed, and did it anyway. "Fernando Peyroteo was the best, my friend, much as it hurts. You have to admit it, even if the best wasn't Spanish. 554 goals in 334 matches for the Sporting Club of Lisbon, and another 15 for Portugal. No one has numbers like that."\n\n"You and your numbers," grumbled Juan. "Numbers won't tell you anything about a goalkeeper. Zamora practically invented goalkeeping, and he may as well have ended it! None will top him".\n\nJaime shook his head while signaling the bartender for another round. "You're both stuck in the past, same as everyone else. Neither of you even saw these guys play, they are ancient! And more importantly," he said, lifting up a finger with authority, "one was Spanish and one was Portuguese. Paco Gento you have seen, and he is Iberian: the best Iberian footballer of all time."\n\nThe argument would rage into the night over more cañas and tapas, across several bars, with no resolution. The drunken trio were forced to call upon a hapless bartender to break the stalemate."

 IBR.3184.t:0 "The New Curriculum" 
 IBR.3184.d:0 "The principal took his seat at the head of the conference table, seated with twelve teachers, all men aged 30 to 60, to discuss how the recent legislation would impact the 1972-1973 school year..\n\nFirst, three years of secondary schooling would be mandatory and free-of-charge for all Iberians aged 15 to 18, including girls, many of whom previously received only primary education. As the number of enrolled students was to increase sharply, classroom sizes would be significantly larger in the following years. Several teachers expressed their concerns, frustrated to be assigned so much more work for no increase in pay, but the principal assured them that this would be temporary as the system underwent its transformation.\n\nSecond, though schools shall remain segregated by sex, girls would now be entitled to free secondary education equivalent to that of boys, in recognition of their increasing involvement in the workforce. Girls would be educated in the arts, science, and even technical skills, to ensure that they could become productive workers and better raise their future children. As a boys' school, this did not especially affect the teachers' jobs personally, though a few shifted in their seats uncomfortably.\n\nThird, the very goals of Secondary Education were to be changed. No longer was the main goal of education to be to guarantee loyalty to the government, strict adherence to gender roles, and conservative morals. Rather, education would become the engine by which a new generation of professional workers and academics would be created. While 3 years of classes on Catholic ethics and religious study will be mandatory, the "Formation of the National Spirit" class for both sexes and the "Houseworks" class for girls have been axed entirely.\n\nThis final point proved much more controversial among the assembled teachers. It was one thing to provide free secondary education to all teenagers regardless of sex, but a different matter entirely to axe such important classes. What was the purpose of schooling if it would not preserve the Iberian family? And what ideas would these girls get into their heads?"
 IBR.3184.a:0 "Education is forever changed. Will this help us or hurt us?"

 IBR.3185.t:0 "The Standard Keyboard" 
 IBR.3185.d:0 ""And this is where you'll be working," said João as he set a finger down next to a dusty typewriter, on the tiny desk of the tiny office. "We collect weekly reports on Friday morning, so you're expected to have it done by Thursday afternoon". The new guy, Carlos, nodded and shuffled around to get his things out of his briefcase. It was his first day working in Porto, at the regional office of the federal Ministry of Agriculture. In João's opinion he seemed decent enough, even for a Spaniard transferred from Madrid. That he was Galician and spoke acceptable Portuguese weighed in his favor.\n\nJoão was about to leave when another glance at the typewriter reminded him of something critical. "Carlos, do you know how to type HCESAR?"\n\n"H what?" asked the Galician, bewildered.\n\nHis new boss sighed. "The keyboard on the typewriter. In Spain you use QWERTY, here we use HCESAR. So you've got to learn to type, start over. And no, I am not getting you a Spanish typewriter, unless you want to take it up with Acquisitions. Now look, I'll teach you the important things. You'll notice there's no key for the number one, you use a lowercase L for that. There's also no zero, you use an uppercase O. For asterisks, you type lowercase X, then backspace, then a plus sign over it. And for the number sign, you just..." João's hands flew over the typewriter, manually setting the carriage to type two slashes over an equals sign, achieving '#'.\n\nCarlos nodded slowly.\n\nIn 1937, Salazar personally mandated HCESAR as the Portuguese typing format, and in life scorned any attempts at establishing an Iberian standard unless it meant HCESAR for all. After Salazar's passing and with an expanding federal bureaucracy, the government is beginning to discuss the problem."

 IBR.3186.t:0 "Picasso's Return" 
 IBR.3186.d:0 "Pablo Picasso gazed out of the airplane window. From high up in the air, his native Spain seemed the same as when last saw it, more than thirty years ago. Back then, just as the Republic crumbled, he never imagined he would be gone this long. In later years, after he was further forced to flee from France to Mexico, he never imagined he would be able to return. The return of democracy, flawed as he may have viewed it, finally opened that door.\n\n"The stewardess says we're getting close to Barcelona," whispered his wife Jacinta from the seat next to him. Picasso turned to smile and clasp her hand, but said nothing. He knew it was both an announcement and a warning.\n\nSure enough, within moments Picasso was able to see the Mediterranean on the horizon, glimmering under the sun. And right before it ran the new shoreline, that vast expanse of desolate land created by the dam. It stirred a deep repugnance in Picasso, and a chill ran through him. No amount of pictures could prepare him for the feeling of witnessing it in person, the sheer magnitude of Atlantropa's devastation. Even with some of the land put to use, it was beyond unnatural.\n\nThe artist settled back in his seat and rested his eyes, attempting to drown out his thoughts with the drone of the engine. Eighty-nine years coursed through his bones. They had seen him through a lot: his youth in Málaga, his establishment in Montmartre, the rise of Cubism, the strife of war, the Great Depression, his own depressions, all the friends he had made, all the women he had courted. Of late, the many lovely years in Mexico, of wine and good company in pleasant Acapulco. Nearly all of that - all those places, all those people - were spent and gone, vanished into time. That was normal, he was old. Time to come home."

 IBR.3187.t:0 "The Death of Picasso" ##Return version
 IBR.3187.d:0 "Carolina, like many that morning, heard the news break on the radio: Pablo Picasso had died the night before, aged 91. Heart failure while hosting friends for dinner at his home in Sarrià, on the outskirts of Barcelona. Just like that, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century would never paint again. Trying and failing to think through the shock, Carolina acted on an impulse. She finished her coffee, grabbed her bag, and left home.\n\nOn the streets of Barcelona it seemed a normal spring day, the sun peeking into the tight cobblestone streets of the Gothic Quarter. Finding her way through the alleys, Carolina found the gates of the Picasso Museum already surrounded with flowers, lit candles, and a small crowd. She quickly bought her own candle from a passing vendor and laid it down. As the hours passed, the crowd would swell and spill all over the museum and the streets around it. Grand wreaths and floral arrangements would be set up, lone musicians and eventually bands would play, speeches were given.\n\nVigils of this sort, big and small, sprung up in Madrid, in Picasso's birthplace of Málaga, in Porto and Lisbon and across the world. For Iberia, he had been not only a great artist, but his return had marked a milestone in the transition to democracy, as if to confirm that it was not just their imagination that things were getting better. Carolina stayed in that vigil, which seemed more a celebration of life than a mourning of death, through to the afternoon and into the evening."

 IBR.3190.t:0 "The Death of Picasso" ##Exiled version
 IBR.3190.d:0 ""Picasso is dead," proclaimed the garrison commander, repeating what everyone had already heard on the radio. "He died last night, exiled in Mexico. He was a communist, and there are reports that his comrades will take to the streets. As his birthplace, Málaga is expected to be one of these hotspots. It falls to us to stop them".\n\nThe Málaga garrison of the Policía Armada raised their arms in salute, all clad in grey. Miguel, corporal, felt his heart swell. He almost wished there were an insurrection, that they might draw out the reds and crush them. There were few opportunities for glory in this town, he thought.\n\nThe reality was less than what he'd hoped for. Through long hours of patrol, the day proved painfully normal, and it was only later in the day that people began to timidly gather outside Picasso's childhood home, leaving flowers and lit candles. It was already dusk, the sun dipping beyond the hills, when Miguel's patrol finally saw some action in the blocks around the house. A band of giggling young men sped past them, running from another patrol that they had been hurling insults at. Most got away, but Miguel managed to bound forward and grab one by the collar with a gloved hand, making him shriek.\n\nPulling the him back to have a better look, Miguel found wide, fearful eyes on the round face of a boy, maybe 15 years old. The policeman sneered and snatched the papers the youth clutched in his hands. It was a poor catch, more trouble than it was worth to process. He chose to simply smack the boy across the head and tossed him back out on the street. "Behave yourself," he instructed, as the boy scampered home. If nothing else, Miguel had imparted a valuable lesson today. He glanced at the papers he had confiscated, some black-and-white prints of Picasso's artworks. Stretched limbs, deformed faces, meaningless shapes. Hideous. Miguel ripped it up and continued the search for communist agitators."

 IBR.3191.d:0 "The tiny cup of tea shook in Manuel's hands as he lifted it to his lips. The shaking had started at some point of his more than 20 years of captivity in Timor. Maybe halfway through, but it had only become noticeable for him when he held a glass and watched the liquid slosh around, spilling over the rim. It took willpower and concentration to drink from his mother's tea set without making a mess, and Manuel took almost as much satisfaction from mastering his hands as he did from the tea.\n\nThe set was the same his mother had owned before he left for the Portuguese colonies, good porcelain painted with blue glazing, in the style of azulejos. It had been her most valued possession back in the 30's, and only brought out on special occasions. Much in the living room had not changed. The photos on the walls, the furniture, the little figurine of Saint Anthony upon the cabinet.\n\nMany other things were different, of course. His father died of bowel cancer in 1957, he had been told on the way to Lisbon. His mother was old, deeply wrinkled, her hair stark white. His siblings were now about as old as his parents were when he had left. The change that he expected to be the most dramatic was the fact that his country no longer existed. Except it did, in a sense, and he felt no great difference living in Iberia than he had in Portugal.\n\nHomes had television sets, and the cars and clothes were all strange to him, but in the end he was drinking tea from the same tea set, under the same roof, in the same city with the same streets. It felt as if the places and the people he once knew had been replaced and were now pretending to be his Portugal. Manuel knew it was silly, but the feeling could not be erased any more than he could stop his hands from shaking."

The crowd found it to be vibrant, joyful, and as hilarious as it was transgressive. Just a year ago such a play would never have made it through the censors. The atmosphere was thrilling, as if the audience was collectively indulging in their favorite guilty pleasure.\n\nCritics had been right: Castañuela 70 was unlike anything ever presented in Iberia and, despite the denouncement from conservative sectors, it appeared as if Iberians had an appetite for precisely this kind of comedy."

Tours throughout the Americas have earned him awards and televised performances in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, on top of his enormous popularity at home.\n\nAn early member of the so-called "Nova Cançó", a movement to revitalize Catalan music, Serrat is no stranger to politics. The son of an anarchist who was part of the CNT during the Civil War, the AAS had kept an eye on his activities since he first came to prominence in the mid-60's, censoring several songs in Catalan and others critical of the Caudillos. Since the turn of the decade, Serrat's politics appear to have mellowed out, and his singing in Spanish now draws criticism from Catalans that he has "sold out".

In the first 'Question' round, 3 couples compete to give as many answers to questions as possible without a wrong answer or repeating a previous answer. The winning couple gets to skip a round, while the two losing couples have to face each other in a second 'Elimination' round, in which contestants face physical challenges, of which the winners face the winners of the first round in the third 'auction' round. Before that, though, an intermission with dancing, music, and sometimes comedy sketches, plays. The 'auction' round has contestants participate in various gambling games for money and prizes, different games every episode. In the final part of the show, they would negotiate with the host for either cash or a final prize, ranging from worthless gag-prizes to luxurious prizes worth many thousands of pesetas.\n\nUn, dos, tres, is made by and for Iberian audiences, with episodes filmed in Spanish but also dubbed for broadcast in Portugal.

Temperate enough that the summer sun was not too painful and the risk of sunburn low, but still warm enough that swimming was enjoyable. Surfing, too, if only they could figure out how to stay balanced on a board.\n\nBut it would be foolish to swim amidst the Atlantic waves after sunset, with nobody to see or hear you if you were pulled into the deep. And so, after many hours that had left the Karlssons satisfied and sore, it was time to return to the hotel. Yes, the hotel--where was it again? There were countless hotels in Sopelana, none particularly distinctive. Johann was beginning to regret picking an inexpensive hotel farther from the beach. Wandering on the streets, the Karlssons became more concerned as the sky turned ever darker. Finally, they caved in. It was time to get some help. "Hotel? Hotel?" Johann asked to someone he presumed was a local.\n\n"¿Si, cual hotel?"\n\nJohann tried to remember what the hotel looked like, and in his best Spanish choked out "Hotel.

Free of the tax obligations on the peninsula itself, their businesses could thrive there. Thus, Porta Delgada became the beating heart of Portugal's Jewish community. But that was a century ago, and now, most of the Jews of Porta Delgada did not possess the wealth that their ancestors had. Most now worked for Catholic employers, facing the same problems that Jews everywhere had faced for centuries.\n\nLongshoreman Salvator Abohbot knew this well. His supervisor seemed to always suspect him of making mistakes, looking at him like he was a criminal. He had a penchant for screaming at workers for "laziness", but was especially aggressive toward Salvator. Everyone knew Salvator was Jewish, of course, his surname was a dead giveaway. And Salvator was not alone in suspecting that that was the reason why his supervisor was particularly hard on him.\n\nA few days ago, after Salvator and another employee received a particularly egregious punishment, the workers started talking. Their supervisor was a short-tempered and hateful man. He had no regard for their safety. Tomorrow, they were going to stop working. At 10:00AM, they left the harbor. Their supervisor screamed, declaring this an illegal strike. But his workers didn't come back. Instead, they went to the media.\n\nThe story spread, and by the next morning the dailies widely reported on the protest--and Salvator's explanation of what triggered it. Perhaps a censor had approved the interview without reading it, or didn't think it inflammatory, but that afternoon dozens of longshoremen, other workers, and Jews from across the city joined in a public protest. When police came to break up the protest, the situation escalated into a minor riot. Three buildings were torched, and more than 30 demonstrators, among them Salvator Abohbot, had been arrested. These are the largest protests that the Azores have ever seen, and they reveal long hidden tensions between the Jews, the Laborers, and the Employers, of Porta Delgada."

 IBR.3203.d:0 "Agustín Muñoz Grandes was long regarded as one of the most fearsome men in all Iberia. A brilliant tactician, a ruthless warrior, and a radical conservative sympathetic to the goals of Nazism. He led the Blue Division of Spanish volunteers in the Second World War, and marched into Leningrad alongside the Heer and the SS. In the aftermath of the war, rumors swirled that Hitler sought to overthrow Franco and Salazar to make Muñoz Grandes his puppet caudillo. Thankfully, Iberia remains free, and in the decades after the war, Muñoz Grandes served faithfully as one of Iberia's top military commanders and political advisors.\n\nA vibrant and lively man well into the 1960s, his health deteriorated rapidly in his final months. He went to sleep the evening of July 11th, and his heart stopped shortly before midnight.\n\nGrandes was a bonafide celebrity among the Iberian far-right, the Falange, and among Spanish nationalists, and they mourn his death with great reverence. But many other people are, truth be told, quite pleased to hear that the man is finally dead. They would not dare to say it in public, but the disdain Grandes held towards reform, towards even the barest deviation from his hardline conservatism, made him a symbol of everything wrong with the Iberian government in the eyes of liberals and reformists across the Peninsula. In the city of Málaga, some elderly residents recalled that he had led the army that slaughtered thousands of alleged 'Republicans', among them neighbors, friends, and family, in the bloodshed of February 1937.\n\nThe death of Muñoz Grandes marks not just the end of one of Iberia's most notorious leaders, but also serves as a reminder of the great age of many in Iberia's top leadership. Salazar also died recently, and Francisco Franco is 76 years old. What will the Iberian government look like in 10 years, or 5, or even just 1 year from today?"

He made a modest living this way, and that is how he preferred it. No employer, no shareholders, the freedom to travel to his heart's content, to schedule his own vacation days and break times. Looking at his well-kempt appearance and semi-formal dress, nobody he met on the street would guess that he lived out of his station wagon.\n\nIf there was one thing Rafael loved about travelling from city to city across the Iberian peninsula, it was the food. Few other places on Earth could claim to be home to so diverse a set of regional cuisines, and a little while ago, he had heard of a culinary innovation in the city of Porto. Ham and linguiça between two slices of bread. Top slice covered in melted cheese, the whole sandwich covered by a spicy beer sauce. The Francesinha.\n\nWeary from a long day, he entered a little restaurant. Finally, he could sit down, rest his legs, and hopefully discover another wonderful meal. He would have the Francesinha, accompanied with a draft beer, or a 'fino' as they would say in Porto. He did not have to wait long to see the sandwich plated before him, delicious smelling steam billowing from a rich sauce. Beer, tomato, a bit of red pepper, and some other spice he could not quite put his finger on.\n\nThe sandwich was as big as it was messy, but the meat inside was so tender that he could cut through it with only his fork. It was delicious: Fatty, spicy, filling, meaty, and above all else, immensely satisfying.\n\nHe would be sure to return to Porto sometime soon."

A week months later, she was killed when a mortar struck the house. The weeks after were hard, the image of mother's blood-soaked, gelatinized face haunting her in both her waking hours and in her nightmares. The months after were hard too. It never stopped being hard after mama died, not even in 1971. She wasn't the only one to lose a mother. Far too many mothers died in the war. At least Ramira was lucky enough to have a caring husband to rely on, old enough to survive and rebuild her life, and one day raise children of her own.\n\nWhat of those less lucky, those left orphaned and homeless? What of the children and the infants? Ramira could never bring back her own mother, or any of the mothers of the children he worked for in the Auxilio Social. But she could offer a warm meal every night, a mattress to sleep on, a chance to learn the Gospels, perhaps, even, offer a conversation to a lonely boy or girl. Ramira joined the Auxilio Social because she cared for children and could understand their pain.\n\nA lot had changed in the decades since mother's death. The Nationalists won the war, and molded the Auxilio Social into an institution to provide for, educate, and indoctrinate, orphaned youths. After the Union formed, she was chosen to lead operations in the Portuguese city of Setúbal. And now, after the end of the Caudillos' reign, the new government had shuttered Auxilio Social entirely on account of its propagandizing. But Ramira wasn't going to stop living after her mom died, she wasn't going to give up working after Auxilio Social was dissolved.\n\nAfter receiving her husband's permission, Ramira purchased the Auxilio Social building. By soliciting donations and recruiting former coworkers, she would rebuild the Auxilio Social, at least in Setúbal. It would take a while to recover from the loss of government support. But as long as there existed death, crime, and suffering, there would be children in need. And that fact alone drove Ramira to keep working."

They have gathered to witness the final game of the Caudillos' Cup, and excitement is through the roof. This is sure to be the most widely seen sporting event in Iberian history, with over half of the population tuning in to witness the match by Television or Radio.\n\nThe Caudillos' Cup was founded in 1949, a tournament in which the 14 teams of Portugal's Primeira Liga, 16 teams of Spain's La Liga, and 2 Colonial teams have faced off. Though intended to promote Pan-Iberian pride, Portuguese fans have in recent years found themselves disappointed. The last time a Portuguese team won the cup was in 1957, and in every year since 1960, the Final has been played between 2 Spanish teams. Real Madrid is near universally agreed to be the best team in the country, having won all but 2 championship games in the past 10 years. However, Portuguese team S.L. Benfica has seen increasing success in recent years, and after defeating Atlético Madrid in the semifinals, now faces Real Madrid for the title of 1970 Champion.\n\nReal Madrid's star player Amancio Amaro had an excellent shot at the goal 4 minutes into the game, but it was successfully covered by Benfica's goalkeeper José Henrique. Henrique is one of the best goalkeepers Iberia has ever seen, and his ironclad defense held against Madrid's offense many times through the match. At 35 minutes, Benfica's António Simões scored a surprise goal, sending Portuguese fans, and for that matter Spaniards rooting for the underdog, into near hysterical celebration.\n\n71 minutes in, Real Madrid's Manuel Velázquez set up an extraordinary cross to Francisco Gento, scoring a goal and tying the game 1-1. At 73 minutes, a tragedy: José Henrique twists his ankle while blocking a shot. Benfica has lost perhaps its single most valuable player, with the much less experienced backup Manuel Bento taking his place. Madrid's offense redoubles their efforts, but Bento holds on. Tension builds across the nation as the game nears its 90th minute, and at 88 minutes, Benfica's António Simões prepares to head the ball.

Immigration to Iberia is virtually unheard of, and Border Customs are not in any shape to handle a sudden crisis of this magnitude.\n\nSalazar generally believes that the Iberian government should work to guarantee the safety of the refugees, both due to moral concerns, and in order to improve the international image of the Iberian government. However, he shares Franco's concerns that leftist extremists living in France may take advantage of the crisis to infiltrate the country. After all, tens of thousands of Spanish Republicans who fled the country after the Spanish Civil War had taken residence in France.\n\nSalazar proposes to organize a small military taskforce to bring refugees to Lisbon as quickly as possible. From there, they may opt for sea transportation to another country, or opt to undergo a vetting process and obtain Iberian residency. Franco believes that this approach carries too many security risks, and instead proposes to allow only a limited number of refugees into Iberia, to be held in internment camps until they can be thoroughly vetted or until travel to another host country may be arranged.

Pulling closer they found an old walled village: Aïn Chaïr, its sandstone buildings seeming more like something out of Medieval times than today.\n\nAs the Iberians approached, a small band of pastoralists prepared to depart the city.

Zdan asked questions and relayed them to Alfonso. The band was a tribe of 46 men, women, and children. Most spoke only 'Tabaldit', a language that neither Alfonso for Zdan had ever heard of, a few of the men spoke Arabic or Tamazight to trade at the oases. It had been many years since any of them had met a European in person; they had not even heard that the French had left Morocco. Alfonso tallied every man, woman, and child, in the band that day.

What had once been an uninhabited island, laying along an ancient trade route between Iberia and Italy, became the largest peninsula of Majorca-Minorca. The site of a small military base, members of the public are forbidden to enter the peninsula, which has left its salt flats largely unmolested by treasure-hunters and ripe with potential for discovery.\n\nHidden in a graveyard of rusted fishing vessels, a typical sight on the salt flats, major historical discoveries were made. Two shipwrecks dated to the Punic era, nine shipwrecks from the Roman era, and two downed Luftwaffe fighters were found and extensively documented in the expedition. Scattered medieval artifacts were also identified, but are too badly decayed to provide any particularly useful information. Most wrecks carried lead ingots from mines in what is now Andalusia towards Mediterranean cities. But by far the best preserved is a Roman ship which sank around 400 AD. The nearly 2000 amphorae on the ship were all originally filled with fermented fish sauce, an extremely popular export from Iberia enjoyed by rich and poor alike across the Roman Empire.\n\nThe assortment of finds on Cabrera has produced enough research material in just the two months since its discovery to fill multiple volumes of text.

Most of the artwork, particularly those near the cave entrance, date to around 10,000 years ago, but small paintings found deep within its caverns are well over 20,000 years old: potentially the oldest artwork in Human History.\n\nIn addition to paintings, several harpoons made of bones suggest a society which both frequently fished and frequently hunted. Most impressive of all, an artistic or perhaps ceremonial item was found: A part of a stag's antler carved into a lifelike Goat's head.\n\nThis is not the first ancient cave discovered in Asturias, but the age and the complexity of the art here hints that the culture of early humans may have been much more sophisticated than previously assumed.

"The King of Pozo Moro", as he is now called, is a mysterious man. Living in the late 6th century BC, the king would have likely had contact with some of the first Greek traders to come to Iberia's shores, the new trade routes bringing him and his kingdom great wealth. The artistic depiction of the gods covering his tomb are heavily evocative of Phoenician and Neo-Hittite influence. Unfortunately, he died around 500 BC, mere decades before writing was brought to Iberia, and no remains of his body could be found at the excavation site. As such, neither the size nor name of his kingdom, nor his identity, accomplishments, or lifestyle, can be determined.\n\nNonetheless, the discovery of the mausoleum has stirred great excitement within the archaeological community, being both one of the oldest and one of the largest artifacts left by the poorly understood ancient Iberian peoples."

He had a talent for exactly copying paper drawings into real dresses, fitted perfectly to both the desire and form of his patrons, and soon his boutique developed into a small, regionally popular fashion brand. Ingratiating himself with the French fashion design community, he moved to Paris to escape the Civil War and to New York to escape the World War. His designs for Hollywood and Broadway stars made him one of the most famous and influential fashion designers in world history.\n\nWhat distinguished Balenciaga most from other fashion designers was his challenging of fashion norms, and of what 'fashion design' itself meant. At a time when 'high fashion' usually meant dresses to highlight the figures of tall, attractive young women, Balenciaga frequently designed for older women, short women, and overweight women. He made designs which hid rather than accentuated hips and breasts. His best known and most influential design was his "baby-doll dress" which mimicked the conservative and highly feminine appearance of dresses of 19th century aristocrats, but which did not require a corset.\n\nNearly all fashion lines today have been inspired or changed in some way by Balenciaga. His decision to retire and return to Iberia in 1968 signalled the end of an era for fashion worldwide, including in Iberia itself. Universally agreed to be the greatest Iberian fashion designer in history, news of his death made headlines worldwide, with hundreds of magazines publishing long memoirs to him and his work."

A preliminary investigation quickly found that multiple support platforms had been removed in the course of recent construction work at the station.\n\nIn response to the disaster, Salazar has ordered a review of construction safety requirements to prevent such a disaster from occurring again. This has also severely disrupted transportation in Portugal's largest city and will force thousands of workers to find new routes to their workplaces, at least for the next few weeks."

 IBR.3221.d:0 "Adela was 43 years old and still unmarried, troubled by her lack of attraction to men. She had to shave daily, and long wished she could be a man. Adela confides in her closest friend, a woman named Isabelita, that she suspects she really is a man. Deeply concerned, her friend recommends that she see a doctor, and to Adela's great surprise: The doctor tells her that she was, in fact, a he. At once relieved to know and frightened by its implications, 'Adela' assumes a new identity: Juan, and Juan must now navigate his way through a society that could not hope to comprehend his identity change. After facing many struggles, the movie ends with Juan obtaining a satisfying job, and marrying Isabelita.\n\n'My Dearest Senorita' has proved an unexpected hit among Iberian audiences, and has become the subject of great controversy. The movie's supporters praise it as a satirical work which highlights the absurdity of society's different expectations for men and women through an equally absurd story. It's critics deride it as a disgusting mockery of Iberian gender roles and relationships, especially objecting to the strong implication that Isabelita and Juan were attracted to eachother when he was still 'Adela.'\n\nBut to a small underground community in Iberia, the movie is something else entirely. To them 'My Dearest Senorita' is the story of a transgender man undergoing a transition in a society unable to view the concept as anything but delison and perversion, and that its acceptance by mainstream audiences could only be achieved with such an overtly ridiculous plot. Perhaps, one day, their own identities would not be seen as repulsive.\n\nRegardless of the true intentions of the filmmakers, 'My Dearest Senorita' is sure to be discussed for years to come."

Unlike virtually all other Iberian bands, Los Bravos performs their songs primarily in English and is heavily inspired by British rock bands.\n\n"Black is Black" is not exactly a creative masterpiece. Its lyrics are blatantly copied from The Beatles' "Baby's in Black", and its instrumentals are suspiciously similar to those of The Rolling Stones' "Paint it Black". But few can dispute that it is a fun song. The simple bass and drums perfectly accentuate the easy to remember lyrics, making for an incredibly catchy tune. "Black is Black" sits at #1 in Canada's weekly charts, and #2 in the United States. It's also proven highly popular in Italy, Australia, Switzerland, South Africa, and of course -- Iberia itself."

Surely, raising that many children at once would be an enormous financial burden, even with a hard-working father and his dutiful housewife. 'La gran familia', a film which premiered December 20th, is about exactly such a family. The film does not exactly have a singular story. It is more like a collection of many short films, each a snapshot into the lives of the family members. Though mainly comedic, these scenes also highlight the tensions of family life, such as the stress that teenagers face preparing for final exams, the immense anxiety characters feel when a toddler goes missing for several hours, or the yearning the children have to own a television, which their family has yet to be able to afford.\n\nSeveral commentators have noted the strong National Catholic subtext of the film. The father is a model of a family patriarch: Strict but not cruel, confident but not vain, hard working, and a devout Catholic. The mother is proud to have birthed so many children, is obedient to her husband, thorough in her housework, and instills in her children responsibility and Catholic morals. Several lines of dialogue seem to encourage the viewers themselves to produce their own 'familias grandes'.\n\nLa gran familia has enjoyed the best release of any Iberian Christmas movie in history.

Hilarity ensues as Agustin's rural mannerisms come into conflict with his son's urban middle class lifestyle.\n\nThough the film has received a lukewarm response among critics, the emotionally light and relatable story has drawn millions of Iberians, urban and rural alike, to the theaters."

Alas, "Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Fifth Floor Neighbor" is virtually certain to obtain that honor within a few weeks. Its opening weekend release sold over three times as many tickets as 'The City is Not for Me' did four years ago.\n\nThe story revolves around two men. One man's gynecology office is failing because he is so attractive that he makes his clients' husbands jealous. The other man's dressmaking business is thriving because he is perceived as non-threatening by his clients' husbands. This, the dressmaker explains, is because he pretends to be homosexual. The two men help each other to obtain one-night stands, but rumors spread that the men are, in fact, a gay couple. Hilarious situations ensue as their suspected abnormal perversions turn them into pariahs and threaten to destroy their businesses and personal relationships.\n\nConservative critics have criticized the film for its bawdiness, but otherwise, the film has proven uncontroversial. The antics of the characters are amusing, and it makes light taboo subjects which polite society would never dare discuss."

The larger population of Spanish speakers in the country, the great size of Madrid compared with Lisbon, and the fact that Spanish studios are generally older and have higher budgets, has left Portugal's film industry small and sapped of talent. This week saw the largest release of a movie filmed and produced in Portugal in over a decade: "The Green Years". The film tells the story of Julio, a 19 year old boy who moves from the country into Lisbon, feeling alienated by the city, isolated by his distance from parents, and anxious over his financial prospects. He begins seeing a girl named Ilda, but as Julio grows increasingly stressed and paranoid, their relationship falls apart.\n\nThe Green Years is critically acclaimed, already regarded as an artistic Masterpiece of Iberian cinema. The Green Years centers around Julio's attempts to find a place for himself in urban society, as well as the harsh realities of everyday life. It stands in contrast to more conventional crime or action dramas: Rather than providing the viewer with escapism, it forces the viewer to question their own lives and their own place in society, at a time when the very world seems to teeter on the brink of destruction."

 #academic crisis
 
 IBR.3227.t:0 "The Academic Crisis" 
 IBR.3227.d:0 "In 1956, Concerned that socialist beliefs were taking root in Portuguese universities, the Caudillos implemented restrictions on students' ability to organize on campus. This backfired, triggering sizable anti-government student protests. The anniversary of the first protest has come to be known as "Student's Day", and once a year, reform-minded Iberian students peacefully protest for greater academic freedom, trusting that their youth and high social status will deter police retaliation.\n\nIn the past two years, these protests have become more explicitly anti-governmental and radical in their demands. Thus, 6 weeks ago the Caudillos prohibited all Student's Day events indefinitely. While most would-be protestors caved to the demands, students at the University of Lisbon arranged a massive strike: As many as 70% of students have stopped attending classes and turning in assignments. They not only demand the reversal of the Student's Day ban, but for wider freedom of speech and organization on campus, and an end to racially and ideologically motivated restrictions on student admissions.\n\nThis protest received little attention at first, leading organizers to adopt a more extreme approach: A mass hunger strike. Over 1000 students filled the UoL's cafeteria, in the single largest protest in Portugal since Salazar took office. The protests must end, lest images of malnourished students appear in the press--or worse.\n\nBoth Caudillos favor the obvious option of sending police to detain the students for a few days and suck the life out of the protest. Some reformist advisors fear that this could backfire and lead to more outrage. Notably, current rector of UoL and former high-ranking minister Marcello Caetano has argued that most of the students' demands are reasonable, and acceding to those demands would weaken support for the other, unacceptably radical proposals. Other advisors bite back that giving the protestors an inch will only encourage more radical protests in the future.\n\nUltimately, however, the Caudillos would not stand idly by as their authority was challenged."

Reformist academics have been roused to action by the student protests, and now seek to continue the struggle for increased freedoms. Marcelo Caetano, a former close associate of Caudillo Salazar and the current dean at the University of Lisbon, has announced his resignation in protest of the government's repression of student expression and academic freedom.\n\nCaetano is something of a political maverick. In broad strokes he is supportive of the ideology and policies espoused by Salazar, but he is also an outspoken proponent of sweeping education reform. Though he was a prominent member of the Portuguese government during the 1940s, Franco's deep suspicions of Caetano and his intentions led to him being sidelined upon the establishment of the Union. While he continues to maintain a regular correspondence with Salazar and serves as one of his advisors in unofficial capacity, he holds no office and it is doubtful he will anytime soon.\n\nStill, as one of the only Portuguese reformers both liked and respected by Salazar, it is not unthinkable that Caetano might one day return to prominence."

 IBR.3229.d:0 "Colonial slavery began with Portugal. The first Portuguese settlements in Guiné became the first large slave depot for European colonists, and for four centuries, tens of thousands of Africans were shipped every single year from Guiné to the colonies of the New World in chains. Colonial Slavery also ended with Portugal, with merchants sailing from Guiné sending the final slaves to Brazil when that country abolished the trade.\n\nPortuguese administrators struggled to find alternative uses for the colony, ultimately coming to rely on modestly profitable peanut farms used to produce cooking oil. On the eve of the Unification, Guiné was an economic burden. Peanut prices had fallen dramatically, and most farmers had returned to subsistence rice farming. The cost of maintaining control of Guiné far exceeded its profits. But having seen the success of cashew orchards in Goa, starting in 1947 António Silva hoped to build a new Cashew empire in Guiné.\n\nIn the 1950s Silva successfully lobbied for high tariffs on foreign-grown cashews. He launched an extensive advertising campaign for his cashews across Iberia, and in 1956 turned his first annual profit. Enticed, various investors pitch in, and the cashew orchards greatly expanded by the end of the decade. As the second generation of cashew trees grow tall enough to produce fruit, in 1962 cashews are becoming cheaper and more widely available throughout Iberia.\n\nAfter consideration by the Colonial Budget Committee, it is agreed that native land may be expropiated for the development of new orchcards, and Africans may have their sentences commuted by choosing to serve a half-length sentence in the Cashew orchards. Now, Guiné prospers, more profitable than it was any other year post-abolition."

Militiamen now guarded the outskirts of the town of Aleg. Years of raids had turned the Aleg Militia larger and more experienced. Usually the Amadous picked easier targets.\n\nPatrols were scarce in this remote corner of the Iberian Empire, and Khadidiatou preferred it that way. The Europeans were thieving taxmen, no more than another gang of Bandits too numerous and well armed for the militia to dare resist. Not that they would want to resist--after all it was the Iberians who supplied the militiamen with weapons and imported luxuries.\n\nA convoy of trucks appeared on the horizon. Iberians, of course, but why were they here? This was not a scheduled ammunition delivery or tax collection, and the convoy was twice as long as any Khadidiatou had ever seen. Dozens of European men, many armed with semi-automatic rifles, stepped out and began unloading cargo. Why were they here? Security? Aleg already had security! Sure, the occasional raid still took place, but at this point bandits stole less from the townspeople than the militiamen themselves.\n\nAnd if the Iberians are here because they think they can take out the bandit gangs..."

Food was more expensive these days, and Umaro was not about to let his family starve, even if it forced him to commit theft. Alas, the rice-seller alerted an officer whom Umaro had not seen, and as Umaro tried to flee, 20 kilograms of stolen rice weighed him down.\n\nHis wife and children had to join him in the orchard. If they refused, how would they eat? Little Harouna, all of four years old, gathered cashew fruits that had fallen to the ground alongside his seven year old sister Duwa. Umaro and his wife Jainaba sat at the shelling station, hammering at the cashew shells to expose the nuts within. Dust entered Jainaba's lungs, and she struggled to breathe as particles of toxic resin lodged itself in her windpipe. Umaro's left hand was blistered from the resin, his glove having partly torn, and needing to work another 40 hours to 'purchase' a new one.\n\nThe lodging was paltry at best: Blankets sprawled over a concrete floor, each man, woman, and child, packed side by side. Bathing consisted of being stripped naked in a line outdoors and sprayed down with hoses. The food was even worse. A bowl of rice twice a day. On Sundays Fufu, bland and unflavored. A tablespoon of peanut sauce or pepper sauce could be purchased for 10 hours work, but with frequent fines, most could not hope to afford this more than once a week.\n\nThe punishments were cruel and frequent on these long, 12 hour shifts. Move too slowly or too sloppily and be caned by the overseer's baton, or be fined for many hours pay. Try to rest for a second and risk being shocked by cattle prod. Many of the workers had scars on their faces, necks, and limbs. Women were typically scarred in other ways. The more 'creative' overseers had even collected resin to paint the skins of those punished, such that blisters would form into patterns and shapes.\n\nThese were facts of life in the orchards of Guiné."

Just about the only thing more difficult than maintaining desert roads is laying them down. Pablo and his fellow surveyors laid down steel markers as they plotted the course for a new road. Officially, this was to promote regional commerce. In truth, this was to give Portuguese settlers a faster and safer path to illegally enter Algeria. As they moved further east, Pablo noticed a most unusual rock. There were many large rocks out here, but this one was much flatter than the others, an ever so slightly green-tinted color, and...was that rust? Was that cracked glass?\n\n"That's not a rock." Pablo said "Oh my God, that's not a rock."\n\nAs Pablo approached the truck, near completely buried by the sand, he shuddered to think of what he might see inside. Hand shaking, he brushed away the dust that obscured the window. There he found bodies. Sickly brown tissue clung tightly to dust-covered bones. Empty eye sockets and teeth almost forming smiles brought disquieting humanity to the emaciated husks before him. They were holding hands when they died, husband and wife surely. On the floor of the passenger seat rested a smaller corpse. Its skull was disarticulated from a torso wearing the tattered remnants of baby clothes.\n\nWho is to say what doomed this family to die here? A flat tire, an empty fuel tank, a failed ignition.

Not since Phillip the Second's reign three centuries ago has Iberia seen any one man do so much to transform the politics, economy, and society of the Iberian Peninsula. But in his final years, Franco's grip on power rapidly deteriorated. A long time enemy of Democracy, he could not resist the wave of reformism coming from both his advisors and the Iberian public. His three and a half decades of authoritarian rule came to an end, and now, so has he.\n\nTo his supporters, he was the man who saved Spain from bolshevism and nazism, restored Spain to its Catholic roots, and created the Iberian Union.

"\n\n"Ah, maybe, Emiliano. Did you want it? Ah... Actually, I'm going to have to make a few calls" he leaned back in his chair and stretched his arms "and that could take a while. Now, I have some very important work I need to be doing. Off you go."\n\nSeriously? Gonçalves would not even give him a file on FISH? What kind of security threat could that possibly pose? It seemed to just get worse with each passing day. More needless hurdles put in his way, for seemingly no reason but spite. What point is there for him to be in Iberia if he couldn't collect even the most innocuous information?"

 IBR.3242.d:0 "The old, wheelchair-bound woman sat on the porch behind her home. A light breeze cooled her face, rustled her flowers, and rattled her windchimes. Alas, the flu had left her arms sore, weak, and feeling nearly as paralyzed as her legs.\n\nSunday was normally the highlight of Clementina's week, a day to fraternize and worship together with her friends and neighbors. But that could not happen this week. In the past, Clementina had little choice but to simply stay in her bed all day when she became ill, with nothing else to do but hope the illness would soon pass. But now, things were different. She owned a radio, and on what were once uneventful evenings, she could listen to the sermons of Father Claret. Even this Sunday, confined to her home, Clementina could rest a bit longer that morning, and listen to the mass of Madrid's Almudena Cathedral that afternoon.\n\nIt hadn't always been like this. For most of its history, Iberian Radio had been dominated by music stations, variety shows, sporting events, and news stories. But now, with funding from the Caudillos, the church now broadcast every day, even to those unable to attend church in person."

We are united in our faith in our Caudillos, and in our national resolve. Iberians stand besides each other as soldiers, friends, and brothers, united in the defense of our nation and her values.\n\nThis year on December 10th, and in subsequent years, we shall celebrate this unity with a new holiday: The Day of Brotherhood. It shall be a celebration not only of our union itself, but of all its people, as we continue our work to build an ever-stronger nation. Past years of bickering are over, and as the first generation of children born in a united Iberia reach adulthood, on the Day of Brotherhood we shall remember our unending pursuit of more years of peace, unity, strength, and greatness!\n\n¡Arriba Iberia!""

 IBR.3244.t:0 "Pilar of Femininity" #New pic: Pilar Rivera
 IBR.3244.d:0 ""Dama de Rivera! I'm so glad you could make it." Franco smiled widely as he embraced the woman.\n\n"Please, call me Pilar, Señor Franco."\n\nPilar Primo de Rivera was undoubtedly the most important woman in Iberia. The younger sister of the late Falange founder José Antonio, she had built the Women's Section of the Falange from the ground up, ensuring that in the chaos of civil war, the children and war-widows would still be fed and given medicine. After unification, the Womens' Section was subsumed into the UN-FET-JONS party. Throughout the 50s, de Rivera exerted genuine political influence in a way no other woman did. In 1962 her section operates a variety of services aimed at ensuring the wellbeing of Iberian women, and just as importantly, ensuring that they were fully indoctrinated into the government ideology.\n\nAs Iberia's most powerful woman ate lunch with the Caudillo, they made small talk, relayed what they had been doing in the past few months. But Franco could sense that there was something seriously bothering his ally. "Is something wrong, Pilar?"\n\n"You know better than I do Señor, the way things are changing these past few years. The feminists seem to grow more numerous by the day, and much as I try, I fear for the future of our young women. And yet, I do not know what else we can do."\n\n"Is that why you came to visit?"\n\n"No, not at all. But it does bother me. You would think they would shut up after we let them into the factories. Or at the very least, stopped demanding we legalize divorce so loud." she rolled her eyes "Exhausting."\n\n"Ah, well, some things never change. Flowers bloom, rivers flow, feminists complain." They both chuckled.\n\n"No wonder they don't have husbands" They both laughed. "Surely you'd marry one, Franco?" They laughed harder."
 IBR.3244.a:0 ""Could you even imagine living like that, Pilar?""

 IBR.3245.t:0 "Formation of the National Spirit" #family propaganda pic
 IBR.3245.d:0 "Like Iberia itself, the Iberian family is indivisible. It is the natural unit from which Iberian society is built. Like law and religion, the Iberian family is inviolable. Always must it be honored, never can it be corrupted."\n\n14 year old Beatriz studied for tomorrow's exam. 'That can't all be right, can it?' Beatriz thought. The large bruise on her thigh hardly felt like it was a sign of her family's strength.\n\n"Like a diamond, the Iberian family is indestructible. Nothing can break the familial bond between husband and wife, between father and son." Was mom's black eye meant to protect that bond?\n\nEven a child could pass, Formation of the National Spirit. Why, then, was it so difficult for her to understand what her textbook was telling her? What did it mean by 'inviolable' or 'honor' or 'indestructible'?\n\n"Indeed, the very values of Iberia are enshrined in its families. Our very destiny is laid out by our families, working as a singular entity in service of God and the nation. That which would threaten the Iberian family, be it divorce, adultery, or homosexuality, threaten the Iberian nation itself just as much as communism, anarchism, and terrorism."\n\nPerhaps dad did what he did out of love. Was that what the textbook was saying? Beatriz had never thought of it that way before. Whether she really believed it or not, the thought of her father as a man who loved his family deep in his heart brought her some comfort. Comfortable enough, at least, that she could rest for tomorrow's exam."

 IBR.3246.d:0 "Gentle waves licked the Cacela Velha beach, low tide revealing all manner of shells and debris once obscured by the water. What better place to relax on a hot summer afternoon? Isabel, Teolinda, and Regina certainly thought so. Alas, it was so busy this time of year, ever since they built the hotel. Vacations from Madrid and the other inland cities, foreign tourists, and oh, oh so many...\n\n"Whores." Isabel chuckled, "They all look like whores!"\n\nThe American women were the most hideous. Tiny bikinis clung to their groins and chests like used chewing gum to school desks. At least the Brazilians usually had the decency to cover their torsos. Yet only the Iberians and the Italians seemed to have the dignity to cover their thighs anymore.\n\nTeolinda's eyes widened "Oh my goodness--look! Is that?"\n\n"No way. Eugénia?!" Isabel put her left hand over her mouth, her expression a mix of disgust and bemusement. To see an American girl dressed like that was one thing, but a local? A classmate, no less? That was not something you saw every day. "What a slut!"\n\nRegina gasped "Look, Maria Natália too! And--MAFALDA?!" What on earth was happening here? Had they all lost their minds? Did they have no manners? Or even the slightest bit of shame?\n\nThough, come to think of it..."

 IBR.3247.t:0 "The Woman Mayor of Bilbao"
 IBR.3247.d:0 "Pilar Careaga organized her notes and adjusted her reading glasses. She was a very familiar face to the other Bilbao government officials, having served on the city council for five years. "Good morning everyone! Welcome to the Bilbao city council meeting July 9th 1969. Hopefully this will be a fast and efficient meeting--I guess that's up to me."\n\nTo have a woman sitting here today-not only hosting today's conference but sitting at the head of the local government, this was truly unprecedented, something not seen since before the Spanish Civil War. By all means, she was as qualified a woman as there was in the country, and as passionate an advocate for National Catholicism as any woman could be. But perhaps that made the situation even more unusual--to even think that a woman who fully believed that a woman's place in society was to be subservient to men would accept, much less actively seek out, such a high-ranking post!\n\nBut Careaga was always an ambitious woman. If she had not been, she would not have tried so hard to become an industrial engineer when no other woman had done the same. She certainly would not have succeeded. Being married to one of Iberia's top diplomats didn't exactly harm her political career either.\n\nAll that said, besides the novelty of having a woman in office, Careaga was not especially different than any other Iberian mayor. The Caudillos' main goal in appointing her was neither out of a benevolent expansion of womens' rights, nor a cynical move to assuage the rise in radicals' outrage at womens' lack of opportunities. Mayor Careaga had much more important issues to worry about, such as repairing the potholes that cratered the streets of Bilbao."

 iberia.1.t:0 "The Situation in Goa"
 iberia.1.d:0 "With the establishment of the Iberian Council, order is being restored to the peninsula, freeing up the government to work on other pressing matters. It is past due that Iberia set its sights on the rest of the world, and the first step of this process will be the coastal city of Goa.\n\nFormerly a Portuguese colony, the port of Goa was seized by India shortly after the conclusion of the Second World War, near the turn of the decade, in tandem with the annexation of Angola and Mozambique by Germany. The garrison had already been substantially reduced, moved to the Portuguese colonies in Africa to defend them from German attacks. Reportedly, not a single shot was fired in defense or in assault of the port city, with the garrison simply surrendering and withdrawing from the port, allowing the Indian forces to move in and capture the colony entirely unopposed. The nature of the Goa Incident, however, raises quite a few doubts within the general staff, some of whom believe that there was more to the incident than the well-being of the troops.\n\nThere are two reasonable conclusions, according to our general staff: The attack was in whole Indian aggression, taking land which did not belong to them - and against such numbers, how could the already minimized garrison hope to resist them? After all, the garrison was outnumbered and under-equipped. Defeat at the hands of the superior Indian forces was inevitable. The second conclusion though carries far more ominous implications, that some unknown factor motivated the garrison commander to order our forces to stand down, surrendering our territories in Goa without so much as a protest."
 iberia.1.a:0 "The garrison commander is at fault here." 
 iberia.1.b:0 "India is clearly the culprit."

 iberia.2.t:0 "Interrogating the Garrison Commander"
 iberia.2.d:0 "Having had a small series of questions with Goa garrison commander Vassalo e Silva, we are now able to confirm... absolutely nothing. Our interrogation has proved entirely fruitless, having gotten little more than his insistence that he is not at fault, that Indian aggression was the root cause, and that he surrendered for the good of his men, despite repeated questioning. While he may simply be non-cooperative and attempting to hide something, it is still entirely possible that he really is innocent and India's aggression was fully to blame.\n\nThe question remains, who is more at fault?"
 iberia.2.a:0 "I don't think he's going to talk." 
 iberia.2.b:0 "If it wasn't the commander, then it was India."


 iberia.3.t:0 "Investigating Goa Documents"
 iberia.3.d:0 "Given the non-cooperative nature of Vassalo e Silva, we have been forced to follow a more complicated trail of information, and our agents have been forced to coast through an endless series of paperwork and reports, but at last they have discovered exactly what they were hunting for - reports, audits, and scores of other documents detailing just what exactly went on in that port. While the political reports appear, for the most part, normal, the financial audits are what we quickly came to have an interest in.\n\nWhile for a time the trends seemed reasonable, there appears to have been a gradual slippage of integrity culminating in an exceptionally large unexplained payment in mid November of 1961.."
 iberia.3.a:0 "I think there's something here." 

 iberia.4.t:0 "Goa Officials Bribed by the Indian Military"
 iberia.4.d:0 "Shocking news! Confirming our concerns, it would appear that unspecified payment was more than just a simple corruption scheme. According to our investigations, the payment can be traced back to several officials in the Indian army, and from there it isn't unreasonable to assume that the stand-down order was motivated by more than the well-being of the troops.\n\nNow we know, for certain, the guilt of Vassalo e Silva. Still, it is entirely possible this conspiracy reaches far deeper than we could expect, and more officials from Goa were involved in this plot than simply the garrison commander. What is our next course of action?"
 iberia.4.a:0 "We must reach the end of this." 
 iberia.4.b:0 "End the investigation and punish those involved."
 iberia.4.c:0 "The Indian Army you say?"

 iberia.5.t:0 "The Anjediva Trial"
 iberia.5.d:0 "Today Vassalo e Silva and his cadre of officials faced trial for allowing corruption to interfere with their duty of protecting Goa. This act was viewed as nothing short of treason by all present. Throughout the proceedings it was apparent on each defendant's face recognition of the consequences they would soon face; As the damned gazed about the courtroom, they found nothing but apathy for their fate. While the trials started with at least a facade of procedure, by the end of it the men behind the show-trials clearly wanted to just get it over with. The sentences were lenient - hard labor until the end of their days."

 iberia.6.t:0 "Government Officials Involved in Goa Bribing"
 iberia.6.d:0 "It appears our little conspiracy goes deeper still. Having expanded the scope of their search, our agents have discovered a very intriguing set of documents. This paperwork reveals that several high officials in the Iberian government also took Indian money, using Vassalo e Silva as a sort of go-between. What will the investigation committee do with this damning evidence?"
 iberia.6.a:0 "Archive the case, NOW!" 
 
 iberia.7.t:0 "Case Archived"
 iberia.7.d:0 "Deep within the vast catacombs that make up the Iberian archives, a box full of files was deposited. While normally the labyrinthine nature of the archives is the scourge of any who work with it, today it was a boon. These documents had two layers of security against any prying eyes. First, they were within one of the most secure locations on the peninsula. Second, they were buried deep within, unlikely to ever see sunlight again. These audits will trouble Iberia no longer."
 iberia.7.a:0 "Make sure it's safe." 
 
 iberia.8.t:0 "The Press Discovers the Bribing"
 iberia.8.d:0 "Clearly the documents weren't as concealed as we thought. Somehow, the press managed to sneak out incriminating documents from the Iberian archives. The press, being the accursed vultures they are, seized on the opportunity for a good headline. Under our noses, the corruption scandal has spiraled out of control to the point where we have no chance of suppressing the news.\n\nMaking matters worse the officials involved have been utterly shamed by the public. While nobody lacks the sense to say such out loud, the attitude is certainly present at any public functions they make appearances at. We'll have to keep them out of the public eye for a time and let this all blow over."

 iberia.9.t:0 "Iberia Demands Compensation for the Goa Takeover"
 iberia.9.d:0 "Earlier today, the Iberian Union demanded of us we deliver to them compensation for their lost colony. They demand restitution, in full, for all the territories we "seized" from them when we recaptured the port of Goa by simply bribing the Iberian garrison to stand down. What makes this even more of a smack in the face is that they also sent their so-called estimates, inflating the value of Goa far above anything it could be reasonably priced at!\n\nThey are expecting a response by the end of the day. How are we going to respond to their ridiculous ultimatum?"
 iberia.9.a:0 "We won't pay a single rupee." 
 iberia.9.b:0 "Perhaps we can find common ground?"
 
 iberia.10.t:0 "India Refuses to Pay"
 iberia.10.d:0 "What insolence! India has refused to compensate their aggression, claiming it was not really aggression. Effectively we have lost every last escudo Portugal has placed into the port. Clearly the only option remaining is to remind them the consequences of flippantly rejecting our offer to resolve the problem peacefully. Although perhaps we may be yet able to strike a deal...\n\nRegardless, we must compose a response post-haste, as we simply cannot allow such a response to go unanswered. What will it be?"
 iberia.10.a:0 "The Goa takeover is an act of war, so be careful." 
 iberia.10.b:0 "How about a symbolic payment?" 
 
 iberia.11.t:0 "Iberia Blackmails us!"
 iberia.11.d:0 "Iberia is back at it again hounding us over Goa. At least this time they had the decency to change their tactics. This time they've informed us they hold compromising information over some of our officers, of which they also threaten to give out. What "give out" means we're not sure. Regardless, they at least had the decency to demand a smaller payment. We can refuse, obviously. However, perhaps we should give them a reduced payment. Of course, they never specified what they meant by reduced, only less than the initial price..."
 iberia.11.a:0 "We'll pay, but not full price." 
 iberia.11.b:0 "We said no." 
 
 iberia.12.t:0 "Iberia Proposes a Symbolic Payment"
 iberia.12.d:0 "Rather than endlessly hound us over payment, Iberia has proposed a far better idea. They have proposed a sort of symbolic payment instead of the original sum. A trinket or something of the sort, it is argued to us, would suffice just as well as a payment. It would be far easier to acquire the resources required for a move like this, but all of this assumes we have to tolerate this hounding at all. Will we go through with a symbolic payment?"
 iberia.12.a:0 "Symbolic. That's it."
 iberia.12.b:0 "What part of no you don't understand?" 
 
 iberia.13.t:0 "A Laughable Check"
 iberia.13.d:0 "The sheer insolence! It baffles a man! India claimed to have folded to our blackmail demands and sent to us a check for the port of Goa. The illusion disintegrated once we received the check, which totaled one rupee! They refuse to pay us any further, claiming that they paid the reduced sum. Goa is lost, and now so is all of our investment into the port city. This whole situation could have been avoided if we had just specified a minimum..."
 iberia.13.a:0 "They played us like a damn fiddle!" 
 
 iberia.14.t:0 "India Stands its Ground"
 iberia.14.d:0 "India insists it will not provide us any compensation for the port of Goa. Given our position we are lack the ability to do anything else about it. If blackmail didn't work, nothing will. Our plans have failed. Our port is lost. Worst of all, our investments are also lost.\n\nThe only thing we can do now is swallow our pride and admit defeat. We need to salvage what we can and bury these negotiations. If we can't, then our government will be rendered laughingstocks in the eyes of the public once more. "
 iberia.14.a:0 "Archive this before the press gets a hold on it." 
 
 iberia.15.t:0 "Another Folder in the Archives"
 iberia.15.d:0 "Initially, the plan was to place the failed Goa negotiations near the corruption scandal. After a moment's reflection, however.. It was quickly decided these documents needed to be somewhere deeper. Somewhere even more hidden. The negotiations were taken deep into the archives, into a place more dust than paperwork. Here was stored some of the most absurd of the incidents Iberia has had to deal with in its lifetime. While the Goa negotiations were certainly not absurd they needed to be buried. There was an open slot, coincidentally between several other diplomatic arrangements, and this slot is where the negotiations were stowed away. And so they were left, to be forgotten to the forces of time."
 iberia.15.a:0 "The archives are a mysterious place" 
 IBR_reformist_tt_39:0 "Ignoring this issue will §Ydecrease reformism in the Council§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_28:0 "Closing this case will §Yincrease the Council's influence§!"

 iberia.16.t:0 "Press Discovers Failed Goa Negotations"
 iberia.16.d:0 "Disaster! The archives must be compromised. Somehow, the press has yet again managed to get their grubby claws on our failed negotiations. Even though we managed to suppress the media from truly capitalizing on our gaffe, the damage has already been done. For the short term our government has humiliated in the face of the public. Thankfully, our agents stopped the press before they were able to showcase our more under-the-table dealings. If they had publicized those we would never hear the end of it.\n\nFor the time being our best action is to ride this one out. It's little consolation, but at least it will be easy to make people forget about this. "

They were all escorted to a prison, and treated like the prisoners they now apparently were.\n\nOver the next few days, the soldier began planning his escape.His plan was simple, slip from the eyes of the guards and glide away to somewhere else. Perhaps by fortune, this plan worked out and soon he found himself out of his confinement. Then came the next part of the plan: He ran. He kept running until his lungs failed him and he could move no longer, and he repeated the process until he was far, far away from Goa. What struck him as odd was how little of a chase was given, but he was too busy fleeing the vicinity to properly dwell on it.\n\nHe was making his way to Bombay, where he had heard there were a lot of British people.

Even if they were, they're certain to have made their way off the island to parts unknown. Worse, it is estimated that a significant portion of the former garrison have engaged in terrorist activities following their prison break. While it is a potential lead on their location, trying to ever get them back is a distant dream."

 iberia.50.t:0 "Official Announcement from the Government"
 iberia.50.d:0 "Featured in the state press, on the front page of the newspaper, was a damning accusation. In bold, capitalized letters, read 'GODLESS FOREIGNERS KILL IBERIAN CITIZENS'. The article itself was no less damning - far longer than the usual news article, it spared no detail on the crimes Indonesia committed on the former garrison of Timor, of which was very painstakingly described as Iberian, not Portuguese.\n\nThe piece launched into the history, and of how the garrison was captured. Then, to the offense of human decency, were used as human labor for menial projects. Because of the total mistreatment of the government, they died, alone, far away from home, and were never to see their families again.\n\nSadly, there was no proper explanation for the mistreatment, other than sheer cruelty. All of this was topped off with a warning, to never let any foreign power take you prisoner... or else this would happen to you."

 iberia.51.t:0 "Protests Against the Government"
 iberia.51.d:0 "Initially a few minor mutters of discontent, the dissent has finally boiled over. At first beginning with a few formal protests, the civil disobedience against the government has intensified to sit-outs and mass showings of solidarity for the families of the soldiers lost in Timor. Chanting all sorts of slogans, most of the anger is rooted in the inaction of the Iberian government. If the garrison soldiers had died, then couldn't they have been saved? All it would have taken was the country acting faster, rather than waiting twenty years to do something about it.\n\nBeing unlawful public gatherings, law enforcement was very eager to have their way in the protestors. All it would take is one piece of misplaced violence, and the boot would come down like an anchor. A justification like this never came, so the police were forced to engage in glorified shooing in order to disperse the protests. At the end of the day nobody who participated in the protests against the Iberian government left without at least some resentment over the matter."

 iberia.52.d:0 "Organized for an upcoming Sunday, a number of Catholic priests had prepared a special service for the now-deceased Timor garrison. Sensing its nature as an easy publicity stunt, the Iberian government quickly latched on to the affair. With the backing of the government, cost was no object. What was once a small ceremony slowly morphed into a country wide holiday.\n\nIt was hosted in many churches around Iberia, and everyone who was able to attend was encouraged to. The idea that some would not be able to was a happening that was prepared for, even if it was for a small few. The ceremony would be televised, and anyone from around the country who wished to watch was able to.\n\nAs for the mourning itself, it was exactly as it could be expected. It was solemn and quiet. The involved priests were as if it was their own parents and brothers that had died, and everyone carried themselves with a dignity that could bring back the dead, if such a thing was possible."

The simple response was that they couldn't. After more cajoling, it turns out that they are not authorized to negotiate. Because of that, they were unwilling to respond - as that would give a false impression.\n\nGiven their relationship with Japan, the Empire manages a significant sum of their foreign policy - and this is part of that sum. Any negotiations we come to with Japan will carry over to Indonesia, and they will be obligated to comply. At least they will be quicker to speak with than the Indonesians..."

 iberia.54.t:0 "Iberia Wants us to Release the Timor Prisoners" 
 iberia.54.d:0 "An interesting message has found its way to our government from Madrid. It's riddled with minor errors, endless verbosity, and seems to try and say the same message repeatedly. Phrased more like a legal document than a communication, it gives the impression that the writer cared more about closing up any potential loopholes as opposed to just giving a message. Whatever their motivations, the message itself is still legible, remarkably. Indonesia has imprisoned the garrison of the former Portuguese holding in Timor - which we liberated on our march southwards - and Iberia wants them back. We have been redirected to from our client state because, allegedly, we control their prisoner management.\n\nIgnoring that this isn't true, for the sake of maintaining an honorable reputation they'll need to be given a response. All that needs to be said is whether or not they'll be allowed to take them home. It's not a hard proposal to stomach, provided they provide transport. Of course Indonesia might not approve, and strongarming them into releasing the prisoners may be more trouble than it's worth."

 iberia.55.t:0 "Timor Prisoners Return Home!" #WELCOME
 iberia.55.d:0 "No reunion lasted long. One would think that separated family, split lovers, would bring something grander. But it didn't. Most just embraced a long-lost loved one, escorting them away with a kind of shocked denial. There was a large wait for many, since it had been decided that the way to go was to summon all the separated individuals and match them with their missing soldier one at a time. It created an excitement with the soldiers, as each one waited in the hopes that they would be the next one to finally go home.\n\nPlacing pressure on Japan was just what was necessary, as they opted to order Indonesia to release the former Timor garrison. Being forced to oblige, they then covered the minor transportation fee to bring them back to their homeland.\n\nThe pride this conveys cannot be easily described! We have bested a superpower, and made them bend to our terms! It is a great propaganda victory, and the population is very well aware of our triumph."
 iberia.55.a:0 "Bienvenidos!"

 iberia.56.t:0 "Japan Refuses to Release the Prisoners" 
 iberia.56.d:0 "Japan was very prompt with their response, surprisingly so. Typically, when communications are opened it takes some time to get answers, and even longer to receive something definitive. Thankfully, this time was different. Once we had transmitted our demands; the immediate release of the imprisoned soldiers from Timor, as they had been separated from their fatherlands for far too long, we received an almost immediate response.\n\nIt was an unceremonious denial. Our imprisoned brethren would be under strict supervision, and were not to be released. When pressed for a justification, cost was cited. When we offered to pay, we were flatly declined. Indonesia, too, has refused further communication on the matter. Since a display of clear malice like this cannot be ignored, we will need to apply diplomatic pressure on the Japanese government."
 iberia.56.a:0 "Please!" 

 iberia.57.t:0 "Iberia Pressures us to Release the Prisoners!" 
 iberia.57.d:0 "As the trouble of pushing a Sphere member into something they really don't want to do is overwhelming, Madrid's prisoner transfer was declined. This seemed to disappoint them, but also looked to be the end of it. Unfortunately, it was not. Taking the mindset that the second and the third time's the charm, they have begun to pester Japanese functionaries everywhere they meet, in order to attempt to wrangle us to the negotiation table, throwing a fit like a child who didn't get their way.\n\nThis does not mean we need to humor them, however. There's no reason to change our ruling on their prisoners - after all, no means no. If compromising the independence of a fellow Sphere member is tolerable, then of course Iberia could still be supplied their prisoners. Any trouble this would stir up is the same as before, as commanding such a petty thing is going to make as many enemies as it could possibly create friends."
 iberia.57.a:0 "Fine." 
 iberia.57.b:0 "We said no."

 iberia.58.t:0 "Japan still refuses"
 iberia.58.d:0 "In order to persuade the Japanese of the need to release our prisoners, nothing short of constant pressure was applied. It began with constantly mentioning it at diplomatic functions. Everywhere a Japanese and Iberian delegate could be found together, it was certain that the Iberian delegate was to bring up the 'Timor situation'. Even after sustaining the pressure, Japan was still aloof.\n\nSince this didn't work, the next plan was to mention it everywhere else. Every opportunity the prisoners in Timor could be brought up, they were. Where they could not be addressed, a chance was created just for the sake of bringing it up. Unfortunately, none of this seems to work. Therefore, the only option is to keep the pressure up, and in more places than before."
 iberia.58.a:0 "Aw, c'mon."

 iberia.59.t:0 "Iberia Keeps Pressuring"
 iberia.59.d:0 "No does not mean no to Madrid! Regardless of how many times an Iberian diplomat is informed that the situation is final, they never come any closer to recognizing the finality of the situation. All that ever seems to come of a meeting involving the two is the Japanese being pestered about prisoners and garrisons. Our officials are growing exhausted with the harassment. With this development, some have taken the mindset that a re-evaluation of our priorities is in order.\n\nForcing the release of the Iberian prisoners is a move growing in popularity with factions within the government, and appeasing them with the benefit of maintaining good relations with another country is a strong benefit. Of course, this says nothing for our credibility- it is very poor publicity move to renege on such a promise."
 iberia.59.a:0 "Fine." 
 iberia.59.b:0 "What part of no don't you understand?"

 iberia.60.t:0 "Japan Continues to Refuse"
 iberia.60.d:0 "Dreadful news! The previous policies of intensifying diplomatic pressure on Japan have not worked. Because it did not work, the plan instead shifted to intensifying it further, in the hopes that Japan would eventually be battered down and accept our demands. As time has moved on, this has proven to not be the case. If anything, our pushing has driven Japan from a simple no to a fiery refusal.\n\nShould we let this continue, there may be a new development resulting in the release of our prisoners, but in doing so we risk permanent damage to our relations. Alternatively, we could stop pestering about it. This would remove any possibility of getting the former garrison back, but it seems increasingly unlikely that such a thing would happen. On the bright side, it would maintain international relations. Ultimately, it was decided to"
 iberia.60.a:0 "Keep up the pressure." 
 iberia.60.b:0 "Drop the issue."

 iberia.61.t:0 "Iberian Pressure Auments"
 iberia.61.d:0 "No matter what they are told, the Iberians never relent. Telling them off only seems to encourage more, like a child testing their boundaries. Our officials are exhausted with it, and the affair has reached a particular boiling point recently, when the pressure has only intensified orders of magnitude. Even worse, details of this have leaked to the public. They have taken the side of the Timor prisoners, supporting their release.\n\nStopping a crisis will require bending to the public will and releasing the prisoners. Thankfully, this will mean an end to the unceasing diplomatic whining. The downsides are twofold, however - Madrid is leaving with a sense of arrogance, now finding that they can force another minority to their will as they please. Furthermore, Indonesia will more than certainly not prefer this approach. Unfortunately, this is all that can be done."
 iberia.61.a:0 "Shut up! Take them! Leave us alone!"

 iberia.62.t:0 "March in Support of the Prisoners"
 iberia.62.d:0 "A large number of citizens gathered in Madrid but especially in Lisbon. There, they began to march. Against so large a group, with such a cause, law enforcement was unable to do anything to stop them. The whole affair lacked glamour - frequently just citizens marching through either city - but grew, as street goers joined in. Some of the most dedicated held up pictures, taken of the soldiers of Timor. Others chanted slogans, with 'where did they go' showing itself as the most popular. Lasting for hours, the public demonstrations carried on until sunset, as the darkening sky made it difficult to coordinate. The people had departed, but their message had not.\n\nOur refusal to press the issue on Timor has proven disastrous. Confusing pragmatism with forgetfulness, the public has expressed anger at the government. We have to release a statement now, if we hope to save any face."

 iberia.63.d:0 "Our decision to drop the support of our prisoners has proven to be a horrible mistake. In the hopes of reaching stable relations otherwise with Japan, the Timor garrison was deemed less important. As if out of spite, Tokyo released a public statement affirming that the former garrison was imprisoned, and will remain that way. Never at any point will they be released, and especially not given transport back to Iberia. Because of our continental separation, we can not do anything. Even if we were closer, we still could not do anything in retaliation. This decision has to be accepted, against our wills.\n\nThe international community has taken a keen interest in this, too - our seeming weakness has been noted, and we have been rendered a laughingstock. It will take a long time to recover from this blow, and even then our standing will never reach what it once was. Indonesia has taken from us even more than our prisoners."

 iberia.64.t:0 "Large Protests after Japanese Refusal"
 iberia.64.d:0 "As if the international humiliation of giving up our prisoners wasn't bad enough, it is nothing compared to the domestic unrest. The prisoners in Timor were used as a propaganda piece, and very strongly so. Their status has been cemented as that of celebrities and they were the apple of the public's eye for a large amount of time. With everyone so invested in their freedom, the response that followed the subject being dropped was predictably severe.\n\nConcentrated in the major cities, but still significant in the countryside, was something that very nearly resembled a riot. Large numbers of people marched against the government, and the hostility was most severe in Lisbon, as Salazar was particularly blamed for losing not only a colony, but the Portuguese in it too. Terrorists and separatists took the opportunity to disguise themselves among the crowds, striking from positions that law enforcement could not engage them from. This has been nothing short of a disaster, and everyone is making sure that we are aware of it."

 iberia.300.d:0 "This morning, shocking news reached the offices of the Caudillos. Upon the front pages of national newspapers was a breaking column. Captain Galvão, a prominent naval officer with the command of a significant vessel in the Iberian fleet, has gone public to national media to speak out against the Caudillos. In this media statement, the Captain goes on at length to discuss what he perceives as continual oppression from the Caudillos, the noticeable loss of freedoms across Iberia, and mismanagement of the armed forces. Due to the status of this high ranking military officer, and the power he holds, the nation has gone into a frenzy over this breaking news. One can scarcely appear in public without hearing talk of this breaking headline.\n\nStrict rules are placed upon all members of the Iberian military, forbidding them to give opinions to the media without strict approval and guidance from public relations personnel or superior officers. Due to this, the testimony that Captain Galvão gave to the media could see him immediately tried by court martial resulting in a dishonorable discharge. To commence such proceedings we would need to speak to his direct superior officer. However, Captain Galvão's statement appears to be rather popular at this moment, and immediately silencing him might be seen by the public as a move of suppression, furthering this crisis. Letting the issue fester, however, is also far from ideal for the public image of the Caudillos."

The reply from his superior officer, which arrived to the office of the Caudillos in a letter, is far from the compliance that was expected.\n\n"Caudillos Franco and Salazar,\nIt has come to my attention that the government seeks disciplinary action upon my loyal subordinate, Captain Galvão, for his comments which have notably upset the Caudillos. I wish to dispel any notions that the Captain acts independently and without approval.\nAs the direct superior of Captain Galvão, I can attest that these statements given to Iberian media were not the sole opinions of one individual. I can further attest that, due to my approval of these statements, I do not find Captain Galvão in direct breach of any media outreach policies, and as such, I shall not be seeking disciplinary action against him.\n\nSincerely,\nContra Almirante Valerio""

Those apprehended in the purge of the Naval forces are to face immediate courts martial in Madrid. Those not facing direct charges within the naval forces are to be closely audited, as we search for any other possible dissidents within the ranks of the Iberian Naval high command.\n\nRear Admiral Valerio, the superior officer of Captain Galvão who defied orders from the Caudillos, was today among the first apprehended in the first wave of these purges. Captain Galvão himself however, whose name now carries significant weight within Iberia, has escaped apprehension. His current whereabouts are unknown. Some speculate that he has fled to South America, while others claim that he may have fled to a hostile nation in search of amnesty and possibly even support.\n\nWhilst the current scope of those affected by the purges is limited, and mostly surrounds those who have supported Captain Galvão, they have only just begun.

Within two hours of her departure, contact was temporarily lost. Today at 1400 hours, we have received a communique from the West Indies Federation, detailing their discoveries surrounding the vessel. This morning, the Santa Maria temporarily docked in Saint Lucia, offloading four injured crewmen for medical attention, before quickly departing once again. As the crewmen spoke only Portuguese, it was not until after the departure of the Santa Maria that local authorities could appropriately discern the situation onboard. Caudillos, the Santa Maria and her nine-hundred occupants, including American and other foreign nationals, are currently held hostage by approximately two dozen pro-democracy terrorists. The leader of the terrorists is said to be Henrique Galvão, however we are currently attempting to confirm these claims. A civilian maritime advisory has already been issued, however our naval forces are not ready to conduct a Caribbean search."\n\nThe room descends into an eerie silence as the Caudillos absorb the gravity of the situation. Quickly, Franco chimes in. "If there are Americans being held hostage by these terrorists, we must contact the American government immediately! They will not stand for this!" exclaims Franco.\n\n"No!

The ship was days ago hijacked by a group of radical Iberian democrats who boarded disguised as passengers, and has since gone off the radar following a quick stop in Saint Kitts, in which crewmen injured in the hijacking were offloaded. Aboard the ship are six-hundred passengers, consisting of women, children, and civilian men. Many of those aboard the ship are Iberian, however the Pentagon confirms that several occupants are American citizens.\n\nIt is possible that all those aboard the ship could meet a violent end, should all go awry, which would include the death of several American citizens at the hands of foreign terrorists. The American public would find such news unacceptable. As such, the only advisable course of action would be to commence a naval search operation to find the Santa Maria, and to liberate those on board.

The intent of the mission is clear. Act fast, ensure civilians are not harmed, and take prisoner as many of the hijackers as possible. As soon as the first shot is fired, the hijackers will mobilize.\n\nThe squad leader gives a short series of hand signals, and they begin to move slowly across the dimly lit deck of the ship.\n\nNot long after, contact is made. The squad leader quickly releases two shots into the armed hijacker patrolling the deck, and the hijacker goes limp. Now that shots have been fired, the marines spring into action. Shots ring out from the other side of the deck, as other hijackers are likely killed. Smithley accompanies his squad in climbing an outer staircase of the ship, as they prepare for close quarters combat upon entering the bridge. The order is given to fix bayonets, and Smithley quickly affixes the ringed bayonet to the socket upon the barrel. Commotion can now be heard from within the ship, as several men begin shouting. Gunshots can be heard from other areas of the ship, as other marine squads quickly dispatch the oddly placed and unprepared hijackers.\n\nSmithley's squad quickly arrives at the entrance to the bridge, from where the ship is controlled. The squad leader begins counting down the entry. Finally, the count hits one, and he springs into action along with the rest of his squad. Quickly, they rush in to the bridge. Smithley, without thinking, dispatches one armed defender before a shot is fired. The other armed men within the bridge drop their rifles, and swiftly surrender to preserve their own life."

Among those captured is Henrique Galvão, who surrendered himself to marine forces once they swiftly stormed the bridge of the ship.\n\nThe United States has already agreed to extradite the Iberian hijackers to us, to be dealt with by our legal system. The Americans, after questioning Galvão, have alerted us of his intentions. The intent of the hijacking was to sail the ship to Portugal, where he intended to incite rebellion within Iberia. Should he have succeeded, he could have proven a true thorn in our side. Our concerns are not dispelled, however. While this one pro-democracy rebel is now in our custody, he did not act alone. There are others within Iberia who would risk their lives to fight for a democratic cause."

 iberia.307.d:0 "From Cuba, a radio broadcast emits. One which the Iberians had never expected nor hoped to hear. Radios across the world crackle to life with the voice of Henrique Galvão, who has recently eluded our capture. He now broadcasts a radio address from Cuba, where he and his hijackers of the Santa Maria have been granted refuge.\n\nGalvão's broadcast much resembles the inflammatory media statements he gave when he was a Captain in the Iberian Navy. This speech, however, is far more radical. Calling for democracy in Iberia, Galvão encourages the Iberian people to take up arms and to oppose the regime of the Caudillos in any way they can. He claims that any Iberian man or woman can make large strides to remove the Caudillos from office, and that should they wish for a brighter future, they should act radically.\n\nWhilst this speech was little more than revolutionary rubbish, many of our people are abuzz with inspiration from the vile broadcast. The Iberian media has been ordered not to cover the incident in any capacity, however around the globe newspapers are choked full of editorials and articles upon the supposed "Iberian democratic movements".

Although internationally considered to be a terrorist, Henrique Galvão and his band of hijackers did not kill any on board the Santa Maria during the seizure of the ship. Following their refuge in Cuba, the Cuban government agreed to provide transportation back to Iberia for the approximate 900 hostages of the vessel.\n\nA wave of teary-eyed friends and family rush forth to meet the disembarking crowd, as the cameras of the media flash in the backdrop. Many among the country feared that many, and even perhaps all, of the hostages would never return to Iberian shores. Contrary to concerns, however, all hostages have now been accounted for. As not all hostages were Iberian citizens, preparations are currently underway to ensure the swift return of foreign nationals to their home countries.\n\nWhilst this represents a major humiliation to Iberia upon the world stage, many count their blessings as their loved ones return home safely from a frightening voyage."

 iberia.309.t:0 "Salazar Pushes Involvement in South African War"
 iberia.309.d:0 "Within the high governmental offices in Madrid, yet another disagreement erupts between the Caudillos. Following the outbreak of the South African War, the German and American spheres have thrown their weight behind the factions of the Boer Republic and the Dominion of South Africa, respectively. As the conflict drags on, concerns within Iberia grow that the German backed African powers may soon overrun the Dominion of South Africa, creating a dominance of the German sphere within Central to South Africa. The United States has grown increasingly involved in the conflict, with a growing American force being committed to the South African War to prop up the Dominion government.\n\nSalazar argues to an unconvinced Franco that the Iberian nation would benefit greatly through intervention in South Africa. While the front lines of this conflict are far from home, assistance to the Dominion of South Africa against the Germans and the Boers could provide a barrier to the further expansion of German influence within the African continent. Furthermore, Salazar argues that within a continent rife with the rise of new nations, significant favor and influence over a well established state such as South Africa could prove an essential strategic stepping stone in the expansion and maintenance of Iberian influence globally.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to come to the formal agreement required for any official action to take place, Salazar is unrelenting in his proposals, believing firmly in the necessity of Iberian intervention in South Africa. If either of the Caudillos is to be moved in his opinion, it is likely not to be Salazar."

He agrees with Salazar that the Americans deserve steadfast support in their South African interventionism, and that Iberia should do all in its capacity to ensure that they do not stand alone in combating German influence in Africa.\n\nThe Caudillos immediately prepare the necessary measures to commence the planning of operations.

 iberia.312.d:0 "This afternoon, the Iberian ambassador in Washington D.C. met with the President. The Iberian ambassador, in a move that has shocked many in our administration, has pledged the direct support of Iberia in the South African War. The ambassador claimed that, should the United States accept the offer of Iberian support in the conflict, Iberia is prepared to contribute significant and direct military combat support.\n\nAlthough wholly unexpected, this news has been welcomed by many in Washington. Previously, many Americans felt alienated within the conflict. It has been widely viewed as if we were standing alone. While the scale of Iberian support has yet to be confirmed, we have affirmed with the Iberian ambassador that we will accept their support without question. Furthermore, our military is poised to provide any aid possible to the Iberians in assisting with the commencement of their operations."

In further support of our efforts, the Americans have pledged extensive logistical assistance to commence our operations in the region, to ensure a smooth operational launch.\n\nSalazar has proven to be quite elated following this news. Already, thousands of Portuguese soldiers are poised for deployment to South Africa, as thousands more conduct additional training to prepare for near-future deployments. Many in the public remain skeptical, however, of the significance of such a conflict. People question why Iberian men must be sent to perish in a conflict thousands of miles away, over a country with no true ties to Iberia. Regardless of skepticism, Salazar has the Portuguese war machine mobilizing as much as feasible, as the countdown to Iberian operations in South Africa begins."

While our contributions pale in comparison to the immense military investments sent forth by the United States, our efforts were nonetheless significant and fruitful. Following such efforts, Salazar stands firm in his belief that Iberia has earned a significant award for her efforts. More specifically, he states, he believes that Iberia has earned back her former Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n\nWhilst the return of the Portuguese colonies is a favourable fantasy for Salazar, reality is often disappointing. For Iberia to seize these lands for herself once again would likely act counter to the interests of nearly all powers in the region. While we may put forth the argument that we have amply paid for this return in blood, it remains highly uncertain whether the Americans will see things the same way. Regardless, Salazar stands firm that we must toss the dice, and formally request that the Americans permit the return of Iberian rule to former Portuguese colonial possessions."

Their sizeable contributions significantly aided in creating the conditions for victory over the Boers and the German sphere. The Iberians themselves are very well aware of this fact, and are thus attempting to leverage it to their best advantage.\n\nRecently, a signed letter from Caudillo Salazar, the Portuguese co-dictator of Iberia, arrived for the Predident. The nature of the letter, if one could get around the complexities of diplomatic writing, was a candid request. Salazar expresses to us that, following the significant Iberian contributions in South Africa, Iberia formally requests from the United States that Iberia be allowed to re-occupy her former Portuguese colonies, seized by the Germans in prior decades.\n\nWhilst we understand the Iberian desire to reclaim her former territories following a hard fought conflict, it would be near impossible to retain a positive moral image should we accept. Our public image was one of fighting for freedom and against German imperialism and aggression in the region. Should we allow Iberia her spoils of war, it would merely appear as replacing one colonial dictatorship with another.

In short, the United States has formally denied our request for the official return of Iberian governorship over the former Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola.\n\nThe President, in his reply, states: "The United States of America cannot, in good faith, guarantee to Iberia the return of any former colonial or other overseas territories and possessions. It was our goal in this costly war to combat the colonial sphere of an imperial oppressor, and to guarantee the self determination of the peoples of South Africa. With this, we believe the Iberian request to be contrary to this goal."\n\nSalazar, in a fury, has gone on at length in private of what he perceives as an American betrayal, claiming that the United States has denied Iberia a claim in the spoils of war. He continues on in saying that the Americans bled the Iberians for their own benefit, and that Iberia will never forget this betrayal.

As a result, once the war concluded and many of the soldiers were free from their contractual obligations to the military, several thousand Portuguese soldiers opted to settle down in South Africa, calling the country their new home, much like the Dutch and British settlers of old.\n\nWhilst these Portuguese settlers had no official status within South Africa, the South African government has recently announced a change to this status. All Portuguese individuals currently residing within South Africa, as a thanks for the immense volume of Portuguese soldiers who fought for them, have been granted official permanent residency status within South Africa. As such, the thousands of Portuguese expats may now legally pursue a largely unrestricted private life.\n\nThis move acts largely as a thanks from the South African government to the brave Portuguese men who put their lives at risk for the continued existence of the South African nation, and as a gesture towards the many who fell in the conflict."

Few have taken better to this life better, however, than a former Iberian Army Corporal named Fernando Duarte.\n\nFernando was always regarded among his peers as a good cook, who would never fail to create a genuine good meal from simple ingredients. He utilized this talent within his new life in South Africa by opening a restaurant in Johannesburg. This restaurant, focused upon home-style cooking and flavourful chicken, has seen wild success, capturing the love and craze of the South African people.\n\nThe wild success of his first restaurant inspired Fernando to open another, and yet another, as thousands packed through the doors of his restaurant to have a taste of the famed Portuguese cooking. The restaurant, known as "Nandos", now boasts five restaurants already in its short existence. One having recently opened in Portugal, Fernando's native country, and four in South Africa, with several more likely coming in the years ahead. As Nandos continues to spread like wildfire, it has become a true success story of South African-Iberian cooperation."

Portuguese, American, and South African soldiers lay dead upon their rifles, their lives extinguished by the advance of the German sphere. The war in South Africa is lost. Just as lost as the lives of those men who lay dead in the streets of Cape Town.\n\nFollowing an expensive and strenuous effort by both the United States and Iberia to prop up the nation of South Africa against the overwhelming forces of the Afrika Schild, the adversity was one that could not be sufficiently overcome. As thousands of brave Portuguese volunteers were sent forth to die in a foreign land, the forces of the Schild continued to press ever farther south, until it was realized by all that this war was one that could not be won. The evacuation of South Africa was swift, with the United States undertaking a large effort to evacuate high value personnel from Cape Town. Tens of thousands of military men boarded ships and aircraft to retreat back home in the final weeks of the South African nation.\n\nAcross Iberia, the defeat in South Africa is seen as an irresponsible military disaster and a humiliation by nearly all, to the point that even Caudillo Franco has noticeably distanced himself from the South African intervention, all too glad to allow Salazar to receive the majority of the backlash for the intervention that was initially proposed by him."

What is lesser known, however, is what is known as "Black psy-ops".\n\nThroughout the South African War, Iberian psychological warfare units have conducted black psychological operations in an attempt to dissuade, demoralize, and convince enemy forces and populations. These initial operations have seen some limited success, however in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States, they hope to expand the scope of their black psy-ops.\n\nThe Americans have been proven to be rather brutal yet effective in securing a stronger hold over South African territory. In conjunction with the South African government and Iberian psychological operations units, an operation has been undertaken known as the "Phoenix Program". This operation aims to conduct a covert psychological operation upon those in South Africa who may possibly lean to support the Schild or the Boers. Through exposure, public himiliation, arrest, and even torture, the CIA and Iberians conduct a campaign of terror among the civilian populace who lean in support of the enemy, aiming to neutralize the membership of hostile organizations. This is just one of many of the black psy-ops concocted by the CIA, from whom the Iberians have been taking ample notes."

These stories, while they may appear to be fantastical, are in fact grounded in reality.\n\nAccounts from across the conflict in South Africa tell of Portuguese medics of the Iberian army coming to the aid of those in peril, risking their own life and limb to do so. Hundreds of South Africans claim to have been in some way rescued by these medics, operating far outside the scope of their mission in order to provide any assistance possible for the South African populace caught in zones of conflict.

In a recent communication, the Iberians have pledged a significant expansion to their existing support within the war. The communication to Washington D.C. outlines many intricacies and details of current Iberian intentions within the conflict, however one pledge within the document stands out from the others.\n\nThe Iberian island of São Tome, which rests just north of the Equator, not far off the coasts of Central and West Africa, carries great potential as a logistics hub for the duration of this conflict. Following the establishment of Iberian operations in South Africa, they now believe the situation to be appropriate to lease access to the island to us, granting us an invaluable logistical asset. Senior military officials believe that the ports of São Tome may be effectively used as a logistics waypoint, and further as a possible airbase for our bomber aircraft fleet.\n\nWhilst plans for the usage of the island remain in the preliminary stages, we have gratefully accepted the Iberian lease proposal, and it is estimated that logistical operations upon the island will commence in a matter of mere months."

When once, one might say the Boers had the upper hand, and at other times people may have talked of an impending American victory, no such talk takes place any longer. The war is not lost, yet neither has it been won.\n\nAs thousands of Iberian, primarily Portuguese, men now lay dead in South Africa, thousands more back home mourn for their losses in a conflict far overseas, in a land no more relevant to them than the shores of Alaska. In the grievance of their insurmountable loss, many have begun to question the war, and the motives behind Iberian involvement. The people look to Salazar for answers, yet he has none to provide for them.\n\nWhen once Salazar would have spoken at length of a restoration of Iberian glory and an Iberian resurgence upon the world stage, now he says nothing.

The content of the documents provided details, at great length, upon the industrial and infrastructural specifications in various vital regions within Mozambique and Angola, now controlled by the Reichskommissariats of the Afrika Schild.

The disaster of the Atlantropa project destroyed the economy, and Germany going into utter freefall obliterated what little remained. His erstwhile allies in the Triumvirate are at each other's throats, ready to drop all pretence of unity over the slightest dispute. The colonization of Algeria in the 1950s, considered a proud accomplishment, has revealed itself as a double-edged sword that has dragged his nation into constant conflict with Italy. Salazar's unfounded notions of a non-existent "Law of Succession", that would see Portugal absorbed into Spain under the reinstated Spanish monarchy after both Caudillos had died, has raised questions about the future of Iberia under Franco. An attempted coup by old shirt Falangists was only just stopped through their removal from power by Franco.\n\nIberia, once proud, has fallen on hard times, and even the Caudillo himself has begun to doubt their ability to stay unified, though he'd never admit this to anybody.

 POLITICS_ANTONIO_DE_OLIVEIRA_SALAZAR_IBERIA_DESC:0 "It would be quite unfair to dismiss Antonio de Olivera Salazar, the leader of Portugal since 1932, as merely an obstructive bureaucrat. Coming to power in Portugal a few years before Franco gained control of Spain, Salazar was a political power player in his own right. Only under the pressure of German troops seizing Angola and Mozambique did he decide to accept a deal with his own personal devil. When Franco approached Salazar to create a defensive-pact-turned-nation, he accepted, merging Portugal with the similarly right-wing nation of Spain. Now the Iberian Union, the two countries would work together in harmony... at least in theory.\n\nIn actuality, however, this could not be further from the truth. Salazar was not concerned with the welfare of the Union so much as the welfare of Portugal. Wielding a desire to protect his nation from anything that might harm her in the one hand, and an almost pathological obsession with vetoing proposals that would solidify the Union further in the other, Salazar quickly gained a reputation in the Council for being obstructive. His paranoia concerning "Spanish oppression of Portugal" led to many a confrontation with Franco himself, who saw him as one of many reasons why Iberia was likely to fall apart. With Franco's attempted passing of the "Law of Succession", meaning Portugal's absorption into Spain through the reinstallation of the monarchy after the deaths of the Caudillos, the divide between the two was firmly set. This was despite Salazar removing old shirt falangist elements who had attempted to stage a coup against the Union."

 POLITICS_MANUEL_FRAGA_DESC:0 "To some, Manuel Fraga Iribarne is the champion of the new democratic Iberia, a firm and fair leader who can keep the country from falling apart in the aftermath of the transition to democracy. To others, Fraga is just another Falangist, a holdover from the old regime whose project is to retain the economic and political legacy of the dictatorship while giving the same old authoritarianism a new, modern sheen. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nA lawyer by trade, Fraga's involvement in politics goes back to the 1950's, when he held various minor posts in the regime of the Caudillos. His big break came when he was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism, where he earned a name for himself by revitalizing the Iberian tourism industry, leading a campaign under the slogan "Iberia is different!" In the 60's Fraga also earned an unsavory reputation for his role as a propagandist for the regime, publicly justifying the execution of political prisoners such as Julian Grimau. Despite his complicity in the worst abuses of the Caudillos, Fraga became a part of a reformist faction within the regime, seeking to move Iberia in the direction of democracy. When the rule of the Caudillos ended, he formed the Alianza Popular, an alliance of various smaller parties led by former reformist ministers in the old regime.\n\nElected to a majority in Iberia's first democratic elections, Fraga and the Alianza Popular now seek to strike a balance between reform and order, bringing Iberia into the 20th century and doing away with the old institutions while also keeping the country together against the forces of political extremism and separatism."
 
 POLITICS_MANUEL_FRAGA_DSC_DESC:0 "To some, Manuel Fraga Iribarne is the champion of the new democratic Iberia, a firm and fair leader who can keep the country from falling apart in the aftermath of the transition to democracy. To others, Fraga is just another Falangist, a holdover from the old regime whose project is to retain the economic and political legacy of the dictatorship while giving the same old authoritarianism a new, modern sheen. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nA lawyer by trade, Fraga's involvement in politics goes back to the 1950's, when he held various minor posts in the regime of the Caudillos. His big break came when he was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism, where he earned a name for himself by revitalizing the Iberian tourism industry, leading a campaign under the slogan "Iberia is different!" In the 60's Fraga also earned an unsavory reputation for his role as a propagandist for the regime, publicly justifying the execution of political prisoners such as Julian Grimau. Despite his complicity in the worst abuses of the Caudillos, Fraga became a part of a reformist faction within the regime, seeking to move Iberia in the direction of democracy. When the rule of the Caudillos ended, he formed the Alianza Popular, an alliance of various smaller parties led by former reformist ministers in the old regime.\n\nAfter the election of the Unión Nacional in Iberia's first democratic elections, Fraga and the Alianza Popular eventually entered into opposition, opposing the anti-democratic trajectory of the new government. With President Valcarcel's failed attempt to destroy the Iberian Council and re-establish a dictatorial regime, Fraga was forced to band together with the other democratic parties in what is now known as the Democratic Salvation Coalition. Thrust into the position of President, he must now keep the unruly transitional coalition alive long enough to deal with the Unión Nacional and ensure the continuation of Iberian democracy."
 
 POLITICS_ALBERTO_ULLASTRES_DESC:0 "Ullastres Calvo was born on the eve of only the first of the many unfathomable catastrophes that seized the reins of the 20th century. He dedicated his early years in Madrid to attaining a strong education, graduating first in Law and Commerce and later obtaining his doctorate. Initially working as professor for Political Economy he soon found his way into serving for the newly established Iberian administration. His economic knowledge was greatly needed as the Union took a harsh economic hit from the 1950s German Financial Crash and the animosity between the Unity Pakt and the Triumvirate.\n\nQuickly working his way up the civil service ladder he was soon screened for ministerial positions. Reservations about his revealed close connections to the highly religious order Opus Dei remained but Ullastres managed to finally serve as trade minister for the Union. The longer he served however the more disillusioned he became with the current direction of the Union, especially its economic policy. So when Iberia's democratisation succeeded he finally decided to act. Along with fellow business reform minded people within the administration and private organizations, amongst them notably Opus Dei, he formed the Partido Renovador Democrático. The party advocated for cutting more government restrictions in the economy and generally scaling back the size of the state. These they argued would bring greater prosperity to the people of Iberia and ensure the capacity of the Union to withstand modern challenges. With lofty promises and great propaganda Ullastres and the party were able to seize the reins of control. They could now begin to shape the future."
 
 POLITICS_TORCUATO_FERNANDEZ_MIRANDA_DESC:0 "Born on the north coast of Spain in 1915 Torcuato Fernández-Miranda enjoyed an education in law before joining the civil war and leaving the conflict as lieutenant. Proceeding to make use of his education he started work as a law professor at the University of Oviedo. His connections to the Francoist regime would however not be limited to the civil conflict. Apparently picked by Franco himself, Fernández-Miranda was chosen to serve in the education department of the new Iberian state. He was reported to be an effective civil servant yet questioned on his political beliefs at times.\n\nOnly when he was able to rise higher in the state apparatus did he choose to disclose some of his leanings. Believing that the Union desperately required a democratic transition to continue thriving and not falling to the traps of ethnic tensions and representation. He soon became a solid part of the reformist faction of the government. Watching as inactivity and caution however reined in men like Fraga and other conservatives he realized the path for the Union required a different path. Creating a new faction around him he was able to garner the support of those with more radical views on democratization and social issues. He now steers towards providing a better and more fair future for the Iberian peninsula."

 POLITICS_ALEJANDRO_VALCARCEL_DESC:0 "Alejandro Rodriguez de Valcarcel is a man from another era.\n\nBorn in 1917 in the closing hours of World War I, the man had little of note occur to him until the Spanish Civil War. A dedicatet falangist, Valcarcel served in a falangist militia during the civil war. A student of law, Valcarcel was unable to finish his studies until after the war had concluded.\n\nThe man led an uneventful life for much of the 50's and some of the 60's, serving as a medium-level provincial governor. He slowly worked up the ranks of Iberia, and by the middle of the 1960's he held high government offices in service to the state. He was noted by Franco for his apathy towards reforms, as he did not like them, but did little to stop them.\n\nOnce Iberia democratized, he saw that his livelihood was being put in dire risk, as with the rest of the politicians of his sort. He later took the role of their leader, rallying all the old guard politicians behind him to create the new Unión Nacional, a party made from the merger of the União Nacional and the Falange.\n\nValcarcel may have won the election, but he has not won the war. Now that he is in power, it falls to him to bring back the Iberia of old, where the Falange reigned supreme. Valcarcel is a man from another era, and if he has his way, then Iberia shall return to it."
 
 POLITICS_ALFONSO_ARMADA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Armada Comyn has found himself reliving his glory days.\n\nBorn in 1920 to a family with a history of fighting and warfare, he was quick to pick up the tradition for himself. Deeply religious, it is easy to say that the apple didn't fall far from the tree. At the young age of 16, he opted to carry on his family's legacy in the best way possible - saving Spain from Bolshevism. After fighting through all of Spain, he later joined the Blue Division and participated in the Fall of Leningrad, aiming to help save a second country from Bolshevism.\n\nBy the late 1940's, Alfonso had become a military instructor in several different academies. He was a natural choice for promotion, from a mixture of genuine talent and political compatibility.\n\nDemocracy treated the man very poorly. He hated every facet, every moment of the system, but for the sake of his job he bit his tongue. He learned greatly from his comrades, who lost their positions for their protests. When the new democracy began to tear down Franco's legacy, he reached his limit. He secretly organized a coup, so that he may save Iberia from Bolshevism once more.\n\nAlfonso Armada shall see himself Caudillo, and he will ensure that Iberia's new state does not repeat the mistakes that made the old Caudillos weak."
 
 POLITICS_ANTONIO_SPINOLA_DESC:0 "António de Spínola was born in 1910 in Estremoz, in what was formerly Portugal. He had a very uneventful childhood, and his path to leadership began in 1920, when he entered the Military School of Lisbon. He learned there for eight more years, and his education paid off when he was made commander of the National Republican Guard. Come 1940, he was sent to Germany to observe their troops operate during Barbarossa.\n\nAntónio was never one for political involvement, finding that politics got in the way of his duties as commander. Even so, he always leaned towards the conservative side of things - though how much this truly showed itself is debatable. This effort clearly worked, since Spinola kept being granted promotion after promotion. It was joked that he would be a Caudillo before 1970, with how fast he was promoted.\n\nWhen Franco died, the Council could not find anyone else to replace his spot as President, and it increasingly seemed like Iberia would have to make do with only Caetano. That is, before Spinola intervened. Through some "surprise politics", he was found Franco's successor.\n\nHe may not have been a Caudillo by 1970, but he still came exceptionally close. Now, with politics as the forefront of his duty, Spinola has set to ensuring that Iberia stays content within its status quo, by any means necessary."
 
 POLITICS_MANUEL_MELLADO_DESC:0 "Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado was born in 1912, in Madrid. Orphaned at a very young age, he relied on his uncle to provide him with what he needed in order to continue studies. He entered the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1929, which was then headed by Francisco Franco. Under Franco's tutelage, he also joined the Falange in 1935. During the civil war, he was quick to distinguish himself and rapidly rose through the ranks, assisting in the operations of the secret police. When World War II broke out, he joined the Blue Division as one of its high commanders, overseeing their operations from Berlin.\n\nAfter the war, Mellado continued to obtain promotions. He was seen by his peers as a righteous man, and despite his lack of political commitment, his strong moral compass often landed him as a reformist. He had no particular attachment to them, but their proposals often found a champion in him.\n\nWhen the Iberian Council lost its grip on the country, they began to take drastic measures to keep their grip. The Council's desperate flailing came to a head when Mellado was ordered to fire upon protestors. Enough was enough.\n\nNow, Mellado has been appointed the provisional President of Iberia. Now, he must create a democracy from a state that did its hardest to stop it. Manuel Mellado wants the best for the Iberian people, but can he achieve this before the infighting consumes Iberia?"
 
 POLITICS_IBERIAN_COUNCIL_PRE68:0 "Every country needs a leader, and Iberia is no exception. However, how do you determine the sole, singular leader of a state when it has two equal leaders? The influence of both Caudillos wane and wax as time progresses, and one takes a greater role in the Union depending on just how much influence they could muster.\n\nSometimes, neither Caudillo can take precedence over one another. When both Caudillos are equal, then neither can honestly be called the greatest leader of Iberia. Therefore, a third party must take their place - the Council."
 
 #Generals and admirals descs 
 GENERAL_MOHAMED_MEZIANE_DESC:0 "The story of how Mohamed Meziane became one of the top generals in Iberia is an unusual one, not the least because he was born the son of an insignificant tribal leader and raised as a Tarifit speaking Muslim. While enrolled in a colonial school where he learned Spanish, Mohamed had a chance encounter with King Alfonso XIII of Spain when he briefly visited the school. Impressing the king with his knowledge of European Geography and his ambition to join the Spanish military, when Mohamed's father was murdered the following year, the King himself paid for the boy to be educated at the Toledo Infantry Academy, overturning a rule that prohibited Muslims from receiving officer training.\n\nDuring the Rif war, Meziane served as a low ranking officer. When an ambush caught the Spanish camp by complete surprise, Meziane shot a rebel that had pointed a pistol at a little known lieutenant colonel.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Francisco Franco.\n\nThe two men became close friends on the campaign. Grateful that he had saved his life, after Franco rose to become General of the Army of Africa, he ensured that Meziane would be brought along to the top with him, with the newly appointed Caudillo naming him Commander General of Ceuta after the Civil War. Shortly after the establishment of the Iberian Union, he was promoted to Army General, and commanded the Iberian seizure of Morocco.\n\nMeziane is widely regarded in Rif and Morocco, as a man who practices Islam and is sympathetic to the concerns of the people in the Northwest African colonies. In recent years he has aided Prince Hassan in his efforts to maintain the peace in the face of rising anti-colonial sentiment. He maintains close personal friendships with both Caudillo Franco and the Moroccan Prince, and though Franco may trust him implicitly, others suspect he may be more loyal to the Kingdom of Morocco than the Iberian Union."
 
 GENERAL_ALFONSO_ARMADA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Armada is among the youngest of Iberia's generals. Only a teenager when he served in the Civil War and only 22 when he marched into Leningrad with the Blue Division, his rise to prominence had little to do with his actual military talent. Rather, it was his connections to the royal family.\n\nAlfonso's father Luis was a Gentleman of the Chamber and close friend of King Alfonso XIII, such that Alfonso's own godmother was none other than the King's mother. He was among the men selected to groom Prince Juan Carlos for an eventual military career, tutoring the Prince throughout his childhood. They maintain a friendly relationship to this day.\n\nIn the reshuffling of the army command structure when the Iberian Union was established, Armada was promoted to Lieutenant General. Today he serves in some ways as a liaison between the Caudillos and the former Spanish royal family, serving as a conduit through which the Caudillos hope to ensure that Juan Carlos remains loyal to and supportive of the Iberian Union and its government."
 
 GENERAL_AGUSTIN_MUNOZ_DESC:0 "Few, if any men in Iberia, are as frightening as Agustín Muñoz Grandes. Born in a small farming village in 1896, he clawed his way to the top by his merit and brutality as an officer in the Rif War, gaining fame for his ability to suppress any insurgency in the cities he marched through. In 1937, he narrowly escaped a massacre by Republican militias to join the rebellion, becoming a division commander in Franco's army only a year later. For his valiant service in Aragon and Catalonia, he was made Brigadier General.\n\nImpressing Franco, Muñoz Grandes was made Secretary General of the Party in spite of his lack of experience and his radical right-wing views. A strong supporter of Hitler during the Second World War, he was ecstatic to be chosen to lead the Blue Division volunteering on the Eastern Front, and he marched into Leningrad as a hero revered by the Spanish far-right.\n\nIn the New Order created by Hitler's victory, Franco could not realistically try to sideline "Hitler's favorite Spaniard", despite increasing fears that he had visions of establishing a more explicitly pro-Nazi Spanish dictatorship led by himself. Indeed, it was in part due to fear of Muñoz Grandes growing influence that Franco and Salazar sought to combine their might in the Iberian Union.\n\nThough his opinions on Germany and Nazism have soured somewhat since the end of the war, Muñoz Grandes remains easily the most reactionary member of the Caudillos' inner circle. He is frustrated by the amount of power Portugal now has over Spanish affairs, and many suspect he would prefer if Franco were sole Caudillo. Whether these rumors are true or not, it is clear that he wishes for a strong and authoritarian Iberian government that can crush all who would oppose it."
 
 ADMIRAL_LUIS_CARRERO_DESC:0 "Luis Carrero Blanco lived an unassuming life before the Civil War, briefly serving as a naval lieutenant in the 1920s and teaching Submarine Tactics at the Naval Warfare College after that. After his father and brother were killed by communist militiamen in The Red Terror, Blanco escaped to Mexico, then returned to Spain to join the rebellion and avenge his family.\n\nAs one of the few experienced naval commanders in the rebel camp, Blanco quickly rose through the ranks, with Franco appointing him as Chief of the Navy General Staff in 1939 just after the war ended. He gained Franco's friendship and trust shortly thereafter, convincing him to maintain Spanish neutrality in the Second World War and urging closer relations between Franco's government and that of Salazar. As one of the architects of unification, he is highly respected by his fellow military and political men alike, both Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nBlanco has not seen naval combat since the Spanish Civil War, and with Américo Tomás becoming the dominant figure in the Iberian Navy, he is increasingly regarded as primarily a political figure rather than a military one. A man prone to conspiratorial thinking, Blanco sees Jewish and Masonic plots hiding behind every corner, and believes that separatists, anti-colonialists, and democratic reformists, seek to destroy Christian Civilization itself. At the same time, he is opposed to Autarky espoused by the Falange, and is supportive of technocrats' efforts to promote free trade and market competition."
 
 GENERAL_ANTONIO_SPINOLA_DESC:0 "António de Spínola is a relative newcomer to the Iberian military command. Born in 1910, he became a cavalry officer in the Portuguese Army in 1928, a position which he would hold for more than twenty years. When Südwestafrika began massing troops on Portuguese West Africa's southern border, he volunteered to lead a cavalry battalion, and held the strategically important border town of Namacunde for several days. His bold defense gave Portuguese nationals precious time to evacuate the colony before its complete takeover by the SS.\n\nHis strategic victory at Namacunde greatly increased his recognition in military circles, positioning him to become a brigadier general in the newly formed Iberian Army. Shortly thereafter he was deployed to Equatorial Guinea for the Congo Expedition. Following the death of his commanding officer from malaria, Spínola became a Divisional General in charge of all Portuguese forces in Equatorial Africa, and under his command the army secured all Cameroonian lands south of the Sanaga River more than a week prior to the expected completion date.\n\nHaving achieved two great military accomplishments in the colonies, Spínola has only become more prominent and is now well acquainted with the Caudillos, as well as other top-ranking military members. An orthodox conservative, he is supportive of the Union and its present leadership, and is not especially drawn to partisan politics. Perhaps the one political issue he is truly passionate about is the reclamation of the stolen colonies of Portuguese West Africa and Moçambique. Though he recognizes that such a reconquest is likely impossible, should an opportunity emerge to fight in Africa once more there is little doubt Spínola will want to serve on the frontlines."
 
 GENERAL_FRANCISCO_COSTA_DESC:0 "Francisco da Costa Gomes did not wish to join the army, but when his father died while he was eight years old, his mother lacked the means to care for him, so she sent him to the Lisbon Military Academy in the hopes that he may earn himself a better future. Francisco despised his time at the academy, but he soon graduated and spent his young adulthood in low-ranking officer positions. Assigned to the defense of Portuguese West Africa against Südwestafrikan aggression as Cavalry Captain, da Costa Gomes distinguished himself as his company prevented German efforts to cut the supply chain to Namacunde for two days.\n\nCosta Gomes had been promoted to Colonel when he was sent to Cameroon, finding that he had coincidentally been assigned to the same division as his former commander in Namacunde-António de Spínola. The two men developed a fondness for each other, and their successful drive to the Sanaga River saw da Costa Gomes promoted to Brigadier General.\n\nAs a bright commander and fast-learner, da Costa Gomes was invited into the Iberian General Staff on recommendation of Spínola in 1951. He has remained a prominent figure in both political and military matters ever since. Da Costa Gomes maintains a strong friendship with General Spinola and is noted for his unusual interest in and sympathy towards the United States of America and its culture."

 ADMIRAL_AMERICO_TOMAS_DESC:0 "If there was ever a man that symbolized the Portuguese Old Guard, it is Américo Tomás. In the First World War, Tomás served on the deck of the Vasco da Gama, Portugal's only battleship, and by the end of the war had been promoted to lieutenant. Shortly after war he joined the crew of a research corvette which sought to measure the depth of the waters off the Portuguese coast, becoming the ship's captain in 1924. For the following twelve years he extensively surveyed the seas, for which he gained considerable recognition within the navy. He became acting head of the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1931, a title he wore proudly for five years.\n\nIn recognition of his expert ability to organize sailors and crew members at sea, in addition to his advanced understanding of hydrology and shipping logistics, Salazar appointed Tomás as Navy Chief of Staff in 1936. His duties continuously expanded as he consistently outperformed other naval staff, eventually mastering ichthyology, naval aviation, and most importantly: naval warfare. It was only natural that he became Portuguese Navy Minister in 1944.\n\nIn the Südwestafrikan War, Tomás commanded Portugal's largest warship, the Afonso de Albuquerque, and was the admiral tasked with the evacuation of thousands of Portuguese settlers and administrators. His success turned him into a national hero in Portugal, and guaranteed his selection for Naval Minister in the newly formed Iberian Union. In this role he has worked extensively to modernize Iberia's navy, and in particular expand its merchant marine.\n\nThough widely admired by the public and understood by all to be one of the finest navy men of the modern age, Tomás is a socially awkward man and has rather little influence in political matters besides those directly concerning the Navy. He rarely feels obliged to debate in political matters, being largely supportive of both the Union and its Caudillos, but as a conservative old enough to remember the chaos of the First Portuguese Republic, he has grown increasingly concerned by the recent rise of liberal agitation."
