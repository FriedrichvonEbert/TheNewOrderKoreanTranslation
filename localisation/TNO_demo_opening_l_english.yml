 #TNO_OPENING_DESC:0 "Welcome to The New Order: Old World Blues! Old World Blues is a demo for The New Order: Last Days of Europe and much smaller in scope than the released mod will be. In this demo, you will be able to fully enjoy four nations: The noble Ural League, the proud communes of Orenburg, the foul bandits of the Dirlewanger Brigade, and the ever-plotting Lysenko of Magnitogorsk.\n\nYou will find these nations fully playable for a bit over five years, primarily for the duration that they are all killing one another. The New Order does not play like many other mods, and is as a narrative experience as much as it is a gameplay one, though you will find the Southern Urals to be fairly gameplay driven regardless.\n\nAll other nations in the mod have had their content removed for the purposes of this demo. However, you will notice the world still changing as the demo progress, giving you hints at what else is to come!\n\nIf you are interested in the mod and like what you see here, please like and favorite the mod, and check us out on social media! You can find links to our Discord, Reddit, and several other sites on the main menu, as well from our Steam page.\n\nThe New Order has been created due to the tireless efforts of numerous developers, contributors, artists, writers, moderators, and a plucky composer. I started this mod over five years ago now, originally for Victoria 2, and it was a very different mod then. Now, for almost two years, me and my team have tirelessly been turning The New Order from a little pet project into something we can all truly be proud of. Over two hundred people have at some point contributed to our project, not counting the numerous donations of work and time given to us by our friends in the HOI4 Modding Coop and beyond, an organization I helped found and am proud to stand by to this day.\n\nWe have faced numerous challenges, but have been blessed with a community that has stood with us through it all. For their patience, dedication, and love, we wanted to reward them and give something back. To our beautiful community, this is for you. Thank you all so much. We are humbled every day just thinking of the great expectations and the amazing support you have given us.\n\nThank you everyone, and please enjoy the demo! There is so much more to come from us, and we hope you will be there along the ride!\n\n~ThePinkPanzer, Lead Developer.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 COUNTRY_INFO_VYATKA: "§G==THE PRINCIPALITY OF VYATKA==§!\n\nThe near-total collapse of Soviet authority in the wake of the West Russian War has, over the years, resulted in all manner of ambitious warlords rising through the ashes and staking their claim to Russia. One such group is a ghost from Russia's turbulent past: the remnants of the Romanov dynasty led by §WVladimir III§! and his allies.\n\nDuring the West Russian War, the hard-pressed German forces allowed a division of European émigrés loyal to the exiled §WVladimir Kirillovich§! to join the fight against the resurgent §RRed Army§!, where they would play a key role in a desperate Wehrmacht offensive. Although the Germans were eventually forced to withdraw, the monarchists pushed on regardless, and were able to establish a permanent foothold in §WVyatka§!. Now §WVladimir III§! and the émigré cliques oversee the strongest bastion of monarchism in Russia. That being said, §WVyatka§! is beginning to face internal divisions. The émigré cliques bicker amongst themselves and compete for political dominance, while the antiquated bureaucracy of the §WPrincipality§! continues to cause problems as time marches on. The Okhrana, the §WPrincipality's§! secret police led by Boris Smyslovsky, has so far been successful in ensuring stability for the regime, but the question of how much power they should wield remains. These issues will need to be addressed before any serious plans for reclamation can begin.\n\nInternally, the §WPrincipality§! is divided between three émigré cliques of equal import. Firstly are the Constitutional Democrats, led by the émigré §WRoman Gul§!, who represent the liberals. They wish to create a functioning constitutional monarchy, complete with guaranteed rights for minorities. Secondly, the Solidarists led by §WAleksandr Solzhenitsyn§! are staunch nationalists with some authoritarian tendencies. That being said, they still wish for some degree of reform from the antiquated systems of yesteryear. Finally, there is §WVasily Shulgin's§! faction, the All-Russian National Union. §WShulgin§! is a politician of the old school, with a history of service dating back to the days of Tsar Nicholas II. Like the liberals, he favors constitutionalism as well, but does not wish to disrupt the traditions of the old Empire.\n\nExternally, §WVyatka§! is surrounded by potential threats. To the southeast, the madmen of the §RAryan Brotherhood§! serve as the most pressing threat. In the north, the unstable §RRepublic of Komi§! is unpredictable and should be carefully monitored, while the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! stirs. If §WVyatka§! is to unite Russia, conflict with them is inevitable. Meanwhile, raids from the §RTatar§! and §RBashkir§! warlords to the west and south are common but are unlikely to escalate into a full-blown conflict for now. Further to the southwest, however, is §RAndrey Vlasov§! and the so-called §RRussian Liberation Army§! based in §RSamara§!. Unlike the §RTatars§!, they harbor ambitions of expansion and may cause problems in the future if left unchecked. To the east lies the warlords of §GBerezniki§! and §GGayny§!. Although §GBerezniki§! pledges their resources to us, their governor may have ambitions of his own. On the other hand, relations with §GGayny§! have mostly been cordial, and it may be possible to sway them to the cause.\n\nThe §WPrincipality of Vyatka§! now stands poised to undertake the arduous task of uniting Russia once and for all. Will Russia find itself ruled by a Tsar once more? Only time will tell...\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* Decide between constitutionalism or the old government\n\n* Prepare the §WPrincipality's§! armies for conflict with rival warlords\n\n* Unify the §WRussian Empire§! once more"

 COUNTRY_INFO_SAMARA: "§G==THE COMMITTEE FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA==§!\n\nIn the bloodiest days of the West Russian War, when it seemed like the Reich's hold on Russia was on the verge of slipping forever, the German high command turned to desperate means to stave off the collapse of their front line. Drawn from a range of auxiliary colonial militias of Russian conscripts that were meant to police German-held Russia, the §WRussian Liberation Army§! or §WROA§! was created. In propaganda, the §WROA§! was depicted as a proud Russian army, fighting the §Rbolshevik§! menace of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§!. In desperation, the Germans even allowed the creation of the §WCommittee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia§!, or §WKONR§!, as the embryo of a free Russian Republic that would rule over areas liberated by the German counter offensives.\n\nReality was much less flattering to the §WROA§!. Its leader §WAndrey Vlasov§!, a former Red Army general, was nothing more than a puppet of the Wehrmacht's high command. His officers were a a disjointed bunch. Many were also captured Red Army officers, preferring to join the §WROA§! than die in a German POW camp. Others were fascist émigrés, joining the §WROA§! on a great crusade to defeat §RBolshevism§!. The common soldiers were desperate cannon fodder, drafted at gunpoint by the Germans and sent to reinforce the most desperate sectors of the front. Far from being welcomed as liberators, Russian people caught in the conflict area welcomed §WROA§! soldiers with rock and insults.\n\nDespite all this, the §WROA§! pushed on. The soldiers fought with the energy of desperation, and managed to help turn the tide in the sector around §WSamara§!. Soon the §WROA§! found itself beyond the German lines, freed from their former taskmasters. With the war winding down and the §RWRRF§! in retreat, the Germans wrote off their cannon fodder as mutinous Slav Untermensch. The new headquarters of the §WROA§! in Samara were not spared any of the terror bombing campaigns that followed.\n\nSince then the §WROA§! has huddled in Samara, having traded one prison for another. Unable to expand their area of control by the terror bombings, and forbidden to go back home in the west, the common soldiers of the army have languished for the better part of a decade in their garrisons. The §WROA's§! officers, meanwhile, have grown weary of §WVlasov's§! indecisiveness. They argue for a more decentralized leadership, and for the abandonment of §WKONR's§! original democratic mission in favor of a continuation of the §WROA's§! junta. Using general §WSergei Bunyachenko§! as their mouthpiece, the men of the Officer's Committee scheme to take advantage of §WVlasov's§! apathy and old age. However the officers are not all united in ideology. Quite a few have formed a pro-democracy faction, and argue that §WVlasov's§! heir as chairman of §WKONR§! should be §WMiletiy Zykov§!, a former journalist that has maneuvered his way into being the chief propagandist of the §WROA's§! regime in Samara. Zykov argues for the continued struggle to liberate Russia from §RBolshevism§! as well as German oppression. In between all this, many common soldiers and lower ranking officers have grown tired of the high command's bickering and seek to follow General §WOktan's§! goal to use the §WROA§! to build a strong, fascist state... and to enrich the soldiers in the process.\n\nThe §WROA§! is at a crossroad. Loathed by all their neighbors as German collaborators, yet feared for their veteran army and iron discipline, the men of the §WROA§! await the end of the terror bombing. Some seek to redeem their honor by rebuilding Russia. Others seek vengeance on the communists and on the Germans who have ruined their life. Finally, a growing minority simply want to lash out at the uncaring world that has forced them to lose a decade holed in Samara.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Determine who shall win the power struggle to be the successor of §WVlasov§! as leader of the §WROA§!\n\n*Finish what the Germans could not do and destroy the §RWRRF§! once and for all\n\n*Show the world the perils of underestimating the so-called "traitorous dogs of the ROA""

 COUNTRY_INFO_KOMI:0 "§G==THE KOMI REPUBLIC==§!\n\nThe failures of §RNikolai Bukharin§!, the §RGerman§! invasion, and the defeat of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! against the §RGerman Reich§! bled the people of Russia far too much, subjecting them to unimaginable horror and destitution for little gain. Rather than the worker's utopia promised by the §RSoviet government§!, the communist experiment ended in failure, as apocalyptic warfare scorched West Russia for the second time in two decades.\n\nThe former government of the §GKomi ASSR§!, a faithful band of Soviet loyalist politicians, gladly went along with §RGrand Marshal Kliment Voroshilov§!'s plans for the restoration of the §RSoviet government§!, and Komi, despite the reservations that its highly politically deviant population held, gladly slipped into the pocket of the §RFront§!, until the West Russian War, and the transition of the §RFront§!'s capital to Syktyvkar.\n\nThe War, the political failures of the §RFront§!, the final assassination of Alexei Rykov, and the bombing of the §RPresidium of the West Russian Revolutionary Front§! marked the last straw for the Komi government, however. §GNikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky§!, the newly appointed head of the §GKomi ASSR§!, took executive action to declare independence from the §RFront§!, being aided in his operation by a slew of former §RWRRF§! politicians, including §xMikhail Andreyevich Suslov§!, foreign minister of the Front, and §SAndrey Alexandrovich Zhdanov§!, a prominent official of the ComIntern.\n\nWith the secession of the §GKomi ASSR§! from the §RFront§! under a newly declared §GRepublic§!, and the loss of yet another capital, the political cohesion of the §RFront§! dissolved, and more and more separatists ate away at the §RWRRF§!'s armies before operations could be launched to put down the rebellions and warlords.\n\nWith the democratic nature of the §GKomi Republic§! becoming well-known throughout West Russia, and the developed city of Syktyvkar becoming swollen with refugees from other, less accommodating warlord states, a climate of political radicalism began to fester within the §GRepublic§!, fed by §GVoznesensky§!'s collaboration with §SZhdanov§!'s communists, and the underground influence of §Rextremist politicians§! who had been set free from the many former GULAGs in the region. Political violence, grand scheming, and paramilitary activity became commonplace, with the corruption within the §GRepublic§!'s armed forces doing nothing to help matters, despite the efforts of talented officers such as §GPetro Grigorenko§! and §GIvan Korolkov§!.\n\n§YThe State of the Komi Republic:§!\nThe state of the §GRepublic§! in 1962 is hardly one conducive to functional democracy, or civilized life. Crime is at a recent high, with constant paramilitary street battles shattering the silence on the streets of Syktyvkar. The plots of shadowy ideologues are constantly pit against each other, in the form of assassinations, thefts, fraud, assault, extortion, and conspiracy against the Republic. While power is brokered within the §GNational Assembly§!, and the §G"Democratic Coalition"§! of relatively centrist parties attempts to keep order and sane governance, §xMikhail Suslov§!'s §xCommunist Party of Komi§! on the far left and §OLev Gumilyov§!'s §OPassionariyy Organization§! on the far right constantly attempt to bring down the government in the shadows, while maintaining a respectable public opinion.\n\n§YThe Players of the Game:§!\nThe §GKomi Republic§!'s politicians are infamous for a particular nature that seems to run through the §GRepublic§! as a whole - a pseudo-addiction to scheming, backstabbing, and power games. Regardless of whether they personally tolerate such underhanded tactics, the environment of the §GRepublic§! demands such tendencies, and so, the politicians which survive this unimaginably stressful environment tend to be forged into metaphorical diamonds - master schemers and maneuverers who can manipulate entire parties beneath their thumb.\n\n§BThe Centre:§!\nDespite the wide variety of democratic parties and the issues which cleave movements apart in Komi, the saving grace of the §GRepublic§! is that democracy, too, is a political question and hot-button topic. The intensity of the efforts to tear down democracy has forged the otherwise disparate centrist parties into a ramshackle coalition to preserve the electoral system at all costs, and fight radicalism. The ruling §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party (DSNP)§!, §MUnion of Young Reformers (SMR)§!, and §gSovereign Democratic Party (PSD)§! have all become tempered allies in the environment of the §GRepublic§!.\n\n§PNikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky:§!\nThe §GPresident of the Republic§! and leader of the §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party§! since its founding, §PNikolai Voznesensky§! is a rather controversial man. Despite his initial electoral popularity, his constant scandals, often revolving around his abrasiveness, racist comments, or allegations of corruption, have eroded his popularity and cast many members of his party into an unfavorable public light. His friendship with the communist leader §SAndrei Zhdanov§! has come under scrutiny in recent months, and it only remains to be seen whether the 1963 election shall be the end of §PVozesensky§!'s political career, or merely the start of his next term.\n\n§MAlexei Nikolayevich Kosygin:§!\nA prominent elected Deputy, and leader of the §MUnion of Young Reformers§!, §MAlexei Kosygin§! is famed as a rather quiet and respectful politician, who serves as the chief "peacemaker" within the center. However, his disillusionment with the current composition of the §GCoalition§! is growing with each and every new scandal §PVoznesensky§! finds himself in, and he constantly finds himself looking at his own potential bid for power. Along with his close friend, §gSvetlana Stalina§!, §MKosygin§! forms the "hardline" wing of the centrist coalition - the wing that will never allow for capitulation to the radicals.\n\n§gSvetlana Iosifovna Stalina:§!\nA former §PDSNP§! member who split to form the §gSovereign Democratic Party§! following yet another infamous scandal, §gSvetlana Stalina§! is a rather young and idealistic firebrand who has overcome her reputation as a splitter, and cut out a position as a force in her own right. §gStalina§! forms the trustworthy right flank of the coalition, with a platform that combines a patriotic, security-centered policy with a strong focus on welfare and public works. Her constant praise of institutional power and stability, as well as her desire to stabilize the foundation of the §GRepublic§! by any means necessary, has led to constant accusations of authoritarianism, but her coalition partners tend to dismiss these claims. After all, §gStalina§! is utterly uncompromising - in her eyes, a strong, democratic §GRussian Free Republic§! is worth the cost - no matter how painful the means are to get there.\n\n§xThe Left:§!\nThe §xCommunist Party of Komi§! is notable in that it is the most united political "wing" in the Republic. The infamous §xMikhail Suslov§! has forged an ironclad political machine out of the far left, leading successful operation after operation to stage scandals, shatter the people's confidence in the government, and establish an environment of constant pressure on the §GRepublic§!'s security forces. However, despite its unity, not all is well within the §xCommunist Party§!. The cracks between its leaders are invisible in public, but all too apparent in private meetings, behind closed doors. In the eyes of Party insiders, a conflict between §xMikhail Suslov§! and §rIvan Serov§!'s orthodox faction and §SAndrei Zhdanov§! and §lSvetlana Bukharina§!'s reformist faction is inevitable - all that remains to be seen is how destructive it shall be to the §xParty§!'s very foundations.\n\n§xMikhail Andreyevich Suslov:§!\nThe stories that one would hear of Komi's infamous "shadow master", §xMikhail Suslov§!, are awe-inspiring, and wide in scope. According to various citizens of the §GRepublic§!, §xSuslov§! is personally behind nearly every aspect of the chaos in Komi, personally orchestrating street battles, robberies, and blackmailing rings while he plays the violin in his townhouse. Not every story is true, of course, but §xSuslov§!'s reputation speaks for itself.\n\nA famed leader within the WRRF with such a fearful political reputation that §RMikhail Tukhachevsky§! condemned him for couping the government without any evidence, §xSuslov§! has maintained his talents throughout the Russian wasteland, honing them more and more as his career advances. §xSuslov§! is a brilliant man who views the §GRepublic§! as his chessboard - a complex machine made up of interlocking mechanisms of class conflict and civil strife. With every move of his paramilitaries and "unaffiliated" Deputies in the §GNational Assembly§!, he comes closer and closer to his goal - the end of the §GRepublic§!, and the restoration of the §RUSSR§!, with himself as the grey cardinal behind it all.\n\n§SAndrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov:§!\n§SAndrei Zhdanov§! is a walking contradiction. He is the leader of the §xCommunist Party§!'s §GNational Assembly§! delegation, and one of the highest figures in the Party - yet his libertarianism and populism seems to fly in the face of what §xSuslov§! is widely considered to want. §SZhdanov§! is a visionary in every way, a fierce, charismatic firebrand - yet he tends to align with §PVoznesensky§!'s government constantly, seemingly missing opportunities to perpetuate the §RRevolution§! that the §xCommunist Party§! so desires. The mystery behind §SZhdanov§!'s motivations and operations raise many questions, but none can doubt his character. According to many centrists across the aisle, if one Communist were to take power, it would have to be §SZhdanov§!. After all... where else could one find such charming, moderate, populist spirit?\n\n§lSvetlana Nikolaevna Bukharina:§!\nThe emergence of the daughter of the doomed §RNikolai Bukharin§! within the §GRepublic§! was hardly expected, but it was hailed by many communists as a sign that their movement was destined for greatness comparable to the strength of the old §RVKP(b)§!. §lSvetlana Bukharina§! rapidly rose into the ranks of the §xCommunist Party§!, being elected by unheard-of margins, bringing her unstoppable energy and ambition with her. Despite her comparative youth compared to many figures within the government, and her questionable adherence to the letter of the line that §xSuslov§! promotes within the §xParty§!, §lBukharina§! is most certainly one of the foremost communists within the §GRepublic§! - and the brightest, most radiant rising star among their number.\n\n§YThe Right:§!\nThe §OPassionariyy Organization§! is a singularly bizarre organization in Komi, a combination of a social club, a secret society, and an apparatus for political coalition-building. Under the wide-spanning umbrella of the §OPassionariyy§! are Eurasianists, "compassionate conservatives", monarchists, and other, smaller movements, all united solely by the desire for a new, right-wing path for the §GRepublic§!. The §OPassionariyy§! are easily the most wide-ranging coalition in Komi, stretching to every possible corner of right-wing thought, and, as of such, paradoxically both prone to infighting, and extremely effective at operating within the §GRepublic§!. Within the §OPassionariyy§!, there is someone for everyone, or so it is said - the media outlets controlled by the organization appeal to the people, rallies are held, and the §Gcenter coalition§! is forced to look closer and closer towards §OPassionariyy§!-affiliated politicians each day.\n\n§OLev Nikolayevich Gumilyov:§!\nThere is only one man in the §GRepublic§! with the cunning and political acumen to unite so many disparate right-wing groups under one banner, and his name is §OLev Gumilyov§!. An eccentric philosopher and a well-spoken ideologue, §OGumilyov§! is the ideological heart of a large section of the §OPassionariyy§!... and the brain, as well. His theories of a Eurasian civilizational empire are ones that most of the Komi right can at least pretend to get behind, and his ideals of rapid expansionism, the restoration of national strength, and a culture of patriotism appeal to the teeming multitudes that attend his rallies. Despite his seemingly unthinkable level of extremism, §OGumilyov§! is the center of the §OPassionariyy§! in spirit, and he will not halt his shadowy operations until his theories may be tested and realized on the grandest scale imaginable - that of a continent-spanning empire..\n\n§YIgor Rostislavovich Shafarevich:§!\nEvery movement needs a face, and §YIgor Shafarevich§! is a respectable face indeed. A well-respected academic in the §GRepublic§!, §YShafarevich§! heads the moderate "moralist" wing of the §OPassionariyy§! - the wing most keyed to gathering public support, and the support of the centrists within the §GNational Assembly§!. §YShafarevich§! is one of the most famous voices of the §OPassionariyy§!, and his calls for a "National Democracy" based off of "compassionate conservative" principles are heard around the §GRepublic§!, on widespread venues such as Radio Free Syktyvkar, the pre-eminent broadcasting service within the §GRepublic§!. As the left grows larger and more threatening, Shafarevich's commitment to democracy and willingness to cooperate with the Centre has driven more and more politicians amongst the right-wing of the ruling coalition to look his way, seeking deliverance from the communist threat.\n\n§jSergey Taboritsky:§!\nThe black horse of Komi, the enigmatic §jSergey Taboritsky§! is famous as an almost anachronistic figure. His Imperial regalia, his nostalgic calls for the restoration of the §RRussian Empire§!, and his vast hidden personal wealth may, in a different state, tear the people away from supporting him, but in Komi, it merely serves to captivate the imagination. §jTaboritsky§! is quite possibly the most populist of the §OPassionariyy§!, tirelessly campaigning for his §jOVRI§! - the §jSociety for the Restoration of the Russian Empire§!. However, among those who have spent time close to him, it has become apparent that something is very, very wrong with §jTaboritsky§! - the look in his eyes is not quite that of a man driven by sheerly mortal energy, and his mannerisms have consistently grown more bizarre...\n\n==FEATURES==\n\n*Fight through the storm of intrigue to save the §GRepublic§!... or bring it §Rcrashing down§!\n\n*Experiment with the many ideologies and parties present within the §GRepublic§!, and bring one to victory\n\n*Put an end to §Rwarlordism and anarchy§!, uniting Russia under the flag of one of Komi's many contenders"

 COUNTRY_INFO_ONEGA: "§G==THE ANTI-COMMUNIST VOLUNTEER GUARD==§!\n\nThe Third Reich had assured the people of the §GFinnish Republic§! that the §RSoviet Union§! would never again threaten Finland, nor its territorial gains in §WKarelia§!.\n\nThe West Russian War proved this to be a damned lie. The §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§ !remnants of the Red Army in Western Russia, nearly managed to derail Germany's new order in Europe. Once the dust had settled, the §GFinnish Republic§! found its eastern border occupied by the remnants of the §RWRRF§!. Looking only to themselves for safety, Finland turned to... Unorthodox solutions. §WRussians§! living in Karelia and around lake Onega were captured by §GFinland's§! new military government. The men were separated from their family, and forcibly drafted into the new §GAnti-Communist Volunteer Guard§. Led by former Red Army General §WVladimir Kirpichnikov§!, this army of the damned would hold the borderland between Finland and the §RWRRF§!. Helsinki's dictats were very simple: all the guardsmen had to do was to defend §WKarelia§! from §Rbandits§! and from the §Rcommunists§ to the east. Loyal service would let the Guardsmen see their family again.\n\nNearly a decade on, the men of the guard cling onto this promise of seeing their family once more. Their task is a gruelling, thankless one. As they patrol the Arctic land around lake §WOnega§!, fighting bandits and communist infiltrator, the Guardsmen look east with uncertainty. The winds are changing in Western Russia, and it is likely that soon their fellow countrymen will come knocking to recapture the land stolen by §GFinland§!.

There, they found an ally of circumstance in the irrelevant apparatchik §RLazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich§!, who proclaimed the West Siberian People's Republic with their support. As the terror bombing began and the Republic spiralled into disarray, the 3rd Army's leader took it upon himself to protect the Russian people from all manner of tyranny. That man was §GMarshal Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky§!, who rallied his forces and proclaimed a provisional government in the city of §GSverdlovsk§!.\n\nSverdlovsk lacks any defining ideological characteristics; instead it remains a fairly benevolent military dictatorship ruled by §GRokossovsky§! and his officer comrades. The military is a formidable force. Commanded by §GPavel Ivanovich Batov§!, it consists of the 3rd Army and a significant number of auxiliary units raised from the population of Sverdlovsk. It also employs some of the most skilled generals in all of Russia. Control of the city of Sverdlovsk provides the District with access to a sizable industrial base, which in turn has created a stable and relatively higher quality of life than most other warlords.\n\nDespite all of this, Sverdlovsk's internal situation is shaky.

Even as the §RCSR§! claimed to be the torchbearer of the people's struggle for peace, it marched it's war-torn men into war daily. §WKrasnopevtsev§! made impassioned speeches before his countrymen, calling for freedom from war and those who send men off to die in it.\n\nFate works in strange ways, in another life §WGeneral Stepanov§! would have mostly likely only seen §WLev§! from the end of a long rifle, and yet, by pure chance, the two were able to strike a deal. §WStepanov§! would provide the §Gmilitary power§! and §WKrasnopevtsev§! would bring his §Gpopular support§! to the table.

As the advance slowed, cracks began to show between the Tsarists and the fascists, and soon the Whites under §RAtaman Semyonov§! seized the city of Chita and officially distanced themselves from the party. If the Vozhd was surprised at this turn of events, he was enraged when former party member §RMikhail Matkovsky§! split the party and set up a rival government in the remote port of §WMagadan§!, posing a threat to the Vozhd's legitimacy and rule.\n\nSince then, based in the small town of Zeya, the Vozhd has become dejected and increasingly paranoid. His closest advisors, §WGeorgy Shekerev§! and §WAlexaner Bolotov§!, the head of the party's paramilitary Blackshirts and the security minister respectively, have indulged his paranoia, bringing the Vozhd lists of internal party members who are dissenters and troublesome figures within the regime.\n\nThe Vozhd plans on creating a strong Russia based in national socialism, where the Vozhd is paramount and his system, derived from the Germans, is law. However, to do this, he will need to cleanse the party of the people responsible for its failures. The Vozhd's immediate internal and external threats need to be dealt with before he can focus on ending the Bolshevik remnants to the West.

The Boers and Anglos stand above toiling African slaves, the Germans stand above them, and §WHüttig§! lords over them all, plotting to expand his empire and contemplating the wrongs he's suffered. There is no wall that is not decked in barbwire, no television not stuffed with listening devices and propaganda, and no (white) child that isn't raised to be a soldier. \n\n As the other German Colonies denigrate ever further into degeneracy and the Reichskommissar's plots to expand the §GReich's§! control over the Dark Continent bare fruit, the people of Ostafrika shoulder their heavy burden without complaint, if only out of fear of the consequences. Hüttig's long-sought war with South Africa seems almost within reach, but the §GAmericans§! might prove to be a greater foe than he had imagined.\n\n His East African Dystopia is perhaps the most successful of the §WGerman African colonies§!, as measured by the fervency and meticulousness of its soldiers.\n\nBut can §WHüttig's§! throne of bayonets remain stable much longer, or will the developing conflict be a tragic defeat for the National Socialist German will?\n\n ==Features==\n\n*§WInvestigate§! your less reliable comrades for corruption and other high crimes against the Reich.\n\n * Lead the charge against the degenerate §WSouth Africans§! with the finest SS divisions of pure Aryan blood.\n\n * Balance the loyalty and §Wbrutality§! of Hüttig's soldiers against their small numbers and frail allies."

The §GReich§! had longed for its lost colonies after the Great War, and wrested them back and more after they won the Second.

Nevermind the onerous costs of maintaining such a large fleet, and the supply lines and facilities to keep them in proper shape. Nevermind the rust gathering on its pilots' hard-spent training, wasted on bombing runs against huts in the Niger or supply drops in the middle of nowhere. As trouble rumbles in §RSouth Africa§!, officers dread the moment their rusty sword is drawn past the Orange River.\n\nIts cities are bastions of civilization among the uncivilized. Conversely, the §WReichskommissariat's§! authority fades the farther one strays from a short list of settlements. Where its jurisdiction is nonexistent in practice flourish a myriad of resistances and united fronts against the colonial menace, biding for the crucial moment their handlers had taught them. Meanwhile, the villagers under their protection wait eagerly for the bird handing gifts from the sky at least once a week.\n\nAt its' apex is §WReichskommissar Schenck§!, a man with a proven record of getting the job done. But that was twenty years ago. Now he spends more time flying his personal craft than in apprising his advisors of this year's plans. Sometimes, his servants catch him heading surreptitiously to one of his mansion's unused rooms at the same exact hour for days on end. Perhaps he was merely a man of privacy?\n\nNevertheless, §WSüdwestafrika§! bustles with action belying its sleepy countenance. In the skies above Windhoek, a flight that never flew draws skeins of vapor that stretch to the far north. In the jungles along the Cubango River, a band of rebels flit their gaze between their watches and the clear blue horizon. And in a Windhoek mansion, a penitent man gazes at the ceiling as he awakes from yet another nightmare.\n\nThe wall clock ticks closer to midnight.

Kennedy,§! find themselves at the helm of the White House.\n\nHowever, the Republican-Democrats no longer remain unchallenged in the political arena. As the American Depression wore on and the matter of civil rights began to enter the public consciousness, some Americans began to turn to alternative voices to represent their grievances. The §PNational Progressive Front§! formed by Henry A. Wallace and Glen Taylor in 1947 became a beacon of progressivism, while George S. Patton's §LPatriotic Party§! was established in 1951 to represent hard-line conservative interests. Both were able to carry states in the elections of 1952 and 1956, but neither could unseat the §RRepublican§!-§BDemocrats.§! In the interests of presenting a united anti-establishment voice, the two parties made the controversial decision to unite under one banner – the §ONational Progressive Party§! – though whether this Frankenstein of a political movement can have an impact remains to be seen.\n\n§YWhere We're At Now:§!\nIn the year 1962, §RRichard Nixon§! is President of the §MUnited States of America.§! Fortunately, his work is cut out for him: Americans from coast to coast desire social reform at all levels. A new crisis is brewing in enemy-controlled §YHawaii§! as the aggressive §xJapanese§! place nuclear missiles on the island chain. Racism runs rampant across the South as African Americans plead for the Civil Rights Act to be signed, while many white Southerners fiercely oppose the Act.

Johnson:§!\nSenator Lyndon Baines Johnson's career is a case study in marrying high-minded ideals to the calculated opportunism of every great statesman. The Texan's passion for change began with a naked eye view of American poverty as a public school teacher, which followed him through every rung of the Lone Star State's cursus honorum. In the face of §BPresident Kennedy's§! inaction, the very same zeal had pushed the §BDemocrat§! Congressman, and his like-minded colleagues, into the §RGrand Old Party's§! welcoming embrace. Yet it was also he who had convinced his new colleagues to caucus with his old party's tatters in 1952. For having helped restore their strength, the §RRepublicans§! and §BDemocrats§! rewarded the man who was one of both their own with the Senate leadership - an iron gauntlet he has since bloodied against dissenters and rivals alike, to great effect. Now Johnson presides over the strongest majority in the august body's history. Many speculate when, not if, the Master of the Senate unveils his vision of the future as President... and what depths he will sink to thrust America towards it.\n\n\n£us_voting_the_npp_senate\n\n\n\n§gStrom Thurmond:§!\nBefore there was a §ONational Progressive Party§!, there was Senator J.

Two years later, he would negotiate a merger between that party and the §PNational Progressive Front§! to form the modern §ONPP§!. As Congressional leader of the §gFar-Right§!, alongside his lieutenants Richard Russell and Robert Byrd, he has used his power to quash any attempt at ending America's racial segregation. Though he has had no interest in running for President ever since his failed attempt in 1960, the elder statesman remains one of the most powerful politicians in America.\n\n§gMargaret Chase Smith:§!\nSenator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine is an anomaly in the §ONational Progressive Party,§! normally caucusing with the right on economic policy and the center on segregation. Resolutely opposed to the §RR§!-§BD§!s, who she sees as cowardly, unprincipled opportunists, she broke with them after the end of the war. One of the few §ONPP§! senators to maintain their seats after the §RR§!-§BD§! landslide in 1960, she has managed to gain a great deal of influence among the few remaining members. She fully intends to keep the §ONPP§! together as a §Gstrong§! and §xhawkish§! opposition to the §RR§!-§BD§!s while reigning in the more extreme impulses of §Msocialists§! and §gsegregationists§! alike.\n\n§gGeorge C.

As the old segregationist §BDemocratic§! machine imploded, he happily jumped ship from party to party, ultimately winding up as one of the scions of the §ONational Progressive Party's§! §gfar right.§! Wallace portrays himself as both a proud Southerner and an American patriot, fighting for "law and order" at home and anti-fascism abroad. Truthfully, he's an opportunist who'll do what it takes to get elected. And if that means re-entrenching segregation across the United States, so be it.\n\n§PMichael Harrington§!\nIn the Midwest, Michael Harrington finds himself the unlikely standard-bearer of the §PCenter-NPP§!, the culmination of an ideological odyssey that brings the democratic socialist into the arms of the §ONational Progressive Party§!.  But America has long turned a deaf ear to the plight of the poor and disenfranchised, and though he works tirelessly with his allies, including Maurine Neuberger of Oregon, the party continues to struggle for a coherent message between the more centrist Center politicians, such as Henry M. Jackson, and the regressive policies of the §gfar right§!. But he is prepared to take his case directly to the people, as he works on his great expose of §PThe Other America§!.\n\n§PHenry M. Jackson§!\nWhen one thinks of the §ONPP§!, Henry Martin "Scoop" Jackson comes to mind as easily as his name leaves their lips. The Senator and erstwhile §BDemocrat§! from Washington was among the first to defect for the fledgling alliance between America's progressives and Southern conservatives. In effect, Scoop's message embodies such compromise by filling the niche between §PMichael Harrington§! and §gStrom Thurmond,§! eschewing radical and racist rhetoric while synthesizing the favorable features of America's political extremes - strong social nets, a hard-line stance against Japan, and others. The party could have carried the man and his ideas to the White House but for §gThurmond's§! own disastrous showing against §RNixon.§!

With both the British and §RGermans§! attempting to court the Iberians into joining their respective alliances, the two leaders would sign the §YIberian Pact§! in 1942, guaranteeing peace between both nations. While peace would reign in the peninsula itself, the war would be brought to the colonial empires, first in 1942 with the §RJapanese§! seizure of Timor-Leste, and then in the later stages of the war, with the Spanish invasion of §YFrench West Africa§!.\n\nAs the war slowly fizzled out, the Spanish would seize the opportunity to reclaim §GGibraltar§! from the fading §YBritish Empire§!, as well as continuing their push into Africa, coming into conflict with local rebel groups that had swept the remaining Free French forces out of their lands.

Well, we were almost correct.\n\nAs the Second World War ended, Brittany had not achieved the liberty we had hoped §YHitler§! would grant us. Still under French rule, the future looked bleak. But history has a funny way of giving every cloud a silver lining. The cloud in question was dark purple, and §YHeinrich Himmler§! was the wind. In an ironic twist of fate, Brittany's greatest contemporary existential threat was the very same that caused us to finally gain freedom, as Brittany gained nominal independence in the wake of the formation of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nThough the lot of the Bretons looked to be improving, the world had different plans. As the Reich plummeted into economic chaos, the various client states, Brittany included, were left largely to their fates. As starvation and poverty loomed, it was §YOlier Mordrel§! who would first suggested the unthinkable; Brittany would have to turn to §YBlack Market trading§! in order to survive. While many worried about the impact government-sponsored crimes would have on the moral fiber of Bretons, the results could not be argued with. Brittany was not only saved, but by becoming a pipeline for Western goods into the Reich, we began acquiring wealth beyond our wildest dreams.\n\nThe Bretons have been through a lot, but our spirits were never broken. As the New Year's celebrations come to an end, and 1962 begins, the Breton republic looks into the future with eagerness, but also doubts. While the §YBlack Market§! shows much promise for the future of Brittany, Breton intelligence sources indicate that the deteriorating health of §YAdolf Hitler§! is the source of increasing power struggles within Germany. Any internal conflicts within Germany could negatively impact Brittany. Additionally, the ever-present §YBurgundians§! have been planning something nefarious for years; Only time will tell how their designs will affect us. Without doubt, the coming decade will be a decisive time for the Bretons.\n\n==FEATURES==\n\n- The time has come to make the §YBlack Market§! a true force to be reckoned with.

 COUNTRY_INFO_GERMANY: "§G==대게르만국==§!\n\nOver the course of the two most destructive wars in history, Germany lost everything only to gain the world. §WThe Thousand Year Reich§! soared over the pathetic Allies of the §RSecond World War§!, crushing resistance against its §WFührer's§! great ambition in both the west and east and marching its army farther than it ever had before. Although it came at a great cost - as all righteous wars do - even §RAmerican§! resistance was ultimately halted §Yin the wake of nuclear fire§!. Finally Germany had won, its honor restored and its destiny made manifest.\n\nThe Reich wasted no time following its victory. Immediately, it embarked on reshaping Europe into its own image - one of §rNational Socialism§!, cleansed of the degenerate Bourgeois and freed from the grasp of the lowly Untermensch. §rLebensraum§! in the East finally became achievable and was, alongside the vast §rAtlantropa Dam§! in the Mediterranean and the §rCongo River Dam§! fuelled by the largest §rSlavery§! apparatus the world had ever seen, the German prestige project in the following years. The §rHeer§! became the largest and most powerful army in the world, protecting German ambitions from the British Isles to the Russian wastes and the Rainforests of Africa. Where once bitter infighting shed brothers' blood, there now stood the Einheitspakt guided by the §WGreater German Reich§! and its visionary leadership.\n\n§RIt did not take long for it all to crumble.§! In the span of less than a decade, the German economy practically evaporated, followed by the disgraceful §RWest Russian War§! that brought the Reich to the brink of collapse, and the betrayal of the §PSS§! orchestrated by none other than the nefarious §PHeinrich Himmler§!. Had it not been for the quick and decisive actions of the Wehrmacht, the Reich would have collapsed. Still, the damage was done - the experiences of the 50's combined with rampant §rslavery§! and the reality of the world pressing down upon Germany has §Rutterly destroyed§! the people's confidence in their government.\n\n§RNo longer is the Reich the proud hegemon of the world; it is now merely a shadow of itself, torn by shameless infighting, united only in fear for its future.§!\n\n==FEATURES==\n\n- Steer Germany's future through §Wfour potential contenders§!, saving or dooming it in the process.\n\n- Restore, maintain or even expand your hegemony across Europe, §Wthrough diplomacy, deceit and war§!.\n\n- Meet the many faces of German politics, §Walign yourself with them or strive to survive their ambitions§!.\n\n==MAJOR CHARACTERS==\n\n§rAdolf Hitler§!\nThe Führer is Germany, and Germany is the Führer. That is the party line, the truth the §rNSDAP§! set in the world and that Hitler finally confirmed in the course of the §RSecond World War§!. When victory came, it did so in glory the Reich had not seen in close to a century - her eternal enemies beaten, crushed under the greatest war-machine the world had ever seen. Hitler became the lynchpin of this glory and to this day his name is written with any mention of it, alongside §Rthose innumerable crimes committed in the process§!. What followed was a decade of prosperity and power, where the Reich stood as the unquestioned hegemon of the world - and utter despair and tragedy in the years after, where the people saw it all crumble to dust. The Führer could only watch... watch, and smile. Watch, and cry.\n\n§LMartin Bormann§!\nThere are few men in the §WReich§! as powerful as §LMartin Bormann§!, Chief of the Party Chancellery. Supported by many and hated by just as many, §LBormann§! has deftly cleaved his way through the byzantine politics that dominate the §WReich§!. Today, he not only stands as, effectively, the spokesman of the §rNSDAP§!, but as the face of the §WReich's§!conservative movement, heartily preaching the values of §rNational Socialism§! and only suggesting minor changes to curb corruption and inefficiency, in contrast to §OSpeer's§! reformism and §gGöring's§! militarism. With his close ties to §rHitler§!, his relative dominance over the§rReichstag§!, and his track record as a loyal supporter of §rNational Socialism§!, §LBormann§! is widely regarded in international circles as the most likely successor to the §rFührership§!. Of course, in the case of the power struggle over the §WReich§!'s reins ever §Rgoing hot§!, having the loyalty of a good portion of the §rHeer§! can't hurt either.\n\n§gHermann Göring§!\n§gHermann Göring§! is a man of much bravado- the bombastic leader of the Militarist wing of the §rNSDAP§!, almost nobody except the §rFührer§! himself can claim the adoration of the public as well as he. One of the original members of the §rNSDAP§!, §gGöring§! commands respect in the way that few others can. With the conservative wing of the Party already firmly under §LBormann's§! control,§gGöring§! turned to the §rHeer§!, quickly aligning just over half of the armed forces to his view. Backed by Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, §gGöring§! promises to bring the §WReich§! back to its glory days- not through reforms, but through conquest. Under §gGöring's§! command, the §WReich§! would march on the rest of the world, conquering anyone and everyone who got in its way. This hyperaggressive foreign policy has certainly raised concerns among the international community- a worry that is not helped by §gGöring's§! seemingly good chance to be nominated as the next §rFührer§!. Whether he could pull off all he promises, however, remains to be seen.\n\n§OAlbert Speer§!\nDepending on who you ask,§OAlbert Speer§! is either the man who can save the §WReich§! or the man who will destroy it. Few men can boast such fame or such controversy as the §WReich§!'s chief architect, whose current goal is to destroy the system that he himself set up- the system of slavery which, as he claims, is choking the life out of the §WReich§!. Having surrounded himself with the §GGang of Four§!- Ludwig Erhard, Helmut Schmidt, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Henning von Tresckow- §OSpeer§! has taken a decidedly reformist tack, seizing the youth with his promises of general liberalization and a better future. Of course, whether §OSpeer§! is as reformist as both his greatest supporters and his staunchest enemies claim is a much different story, as he himself seems unwilling to go as far as the Gang pushes him to. Though his friendship with §rAdolf Hitler§! gives him a chance to be nominated as the §rFührer's§! successor, it's unclear whether he could back that up with force if push came to shove. . .\n\n§PReinhard Heydrich§!\n§RThe Butcher of Prague, the Blonde Beast, The Young Evil God of Death§!- many names have been conjured for §PReinhard Heydrich§!, and yet none of them can accurately sum up the man that is almost universally reviled throughout the §WReich§!. Head of the German §PSS§!, Heydrich's close relationship with §rHitler§!, combined with his own cleverness and the general competence of the modern §PSS§!, is perhaps the only thing that has kept him from being exiled or worse long ago. As head of an organization that is the black sheep of Germany, most see §PHeydrich§! as nothing more that §PHeinrich Himmler's§! puppet on a string, only serving as a figurehead for his nefarious agenda. Technically, §PHeydrich§! is a possible candidate for the §rFührership§!- however, with almost no political power nor popular support, such a choice seems unlikely. In the event that §PHeydrich§! not only is selected as the next §rFührer§!, but secures control over the §WReich§! and defeats his competitors, the world can only quake at the thought of a proud supporter of the §RBurgundian System§! controlling one of the most powerful nations on Earth.\n\n§RFerdinand Schörner§!\n§SFerdinand Schörner§! is famous for many reasons, and few of them are positive. First famous for his brutality during the §RSecond World War§!- up to executing soldiers found behind the front lines without orders-then famous for his failed plot against the §WReich§!, only stopped by the quick actions of §THans Speidel§!, §SSchörner§! has once again made his way back to the upper ranks of German politics with his ferocious backing of §gHermann Göring§!. If §gGöring§! is the head of the Militarists, then §SSchörner§! is its heart. His extreme militarism exceeds that of even §gGöring§!, as he pushes for war with §RBurgundy, Japan, and even the United States§!- things that §gGöring§! himself shies away from. Indeed, some even whisper that §SSchörner§!, not §gGöring§!, is the true power behind the militarist's bid for the §rFührership§!. No matter who wins the struggle for the §rFührership,§! §SSchörner's§! role is nearly guaranteed to play a major part in their administration- too big to get rid of and famously power-hungry, Schörner will waste no opportunity to gain power- both for himself and for his §rHeer.§!\n\n§THans Speidel§!\nThey say opposites attract, but no opposites repel each other like Ferdinand Schörner and §THans Speidel.§! While Schörner has always been one to advocate for increased §rHeer§! involvement in the §rReichstag§!, §TSpeidel§! has argued the exact opposite many times over the years. While Schörner is staunchly against the reforms proposed by §OSpeer§!, §TSpeidel§!, if not receptive, is certainly not dismissive of the idea either. In perhaps the most stark case of this divide, §TSpeidel§! was the one to halt §SSchörner's§! aborted coup in the 50's, sparking a bitter feud between the two that continues to this day. True to his ideals, §TSpeidel§! has professed neutrality in the current struggle for power in the §WReich§!. No matter who wins in the end, however, §TSpeidel§! will certainly be a major player in the struggle for the future of the §rHeer§!- and §SSchörner§! will certainly be there to challenge him."

 COUNTRY_INFO_SCO: "§G==SCOTLAND==§!\n\nDuring Britain's darkest hour, a light that had lasted for three hundred years was finally extinguished. In its place a new one had been ignited, one that had not seen the light for three hundred years, §BScotland§! had been formed out of desperation by General §QDouglas Wimberley§!, the famed general of the §Q51st Highlanders§! and §YJohn McCormick§!, the founder of the small Scottish nationalist party known as the §YScottish National Party§!. In the enduring chaos after the invasion, §BScotland§! was flooded by refugees from §REngland§! looking to run away from the regime propped up by the §gGermans§!. The §BScottish§! people and §YSNP§! as a whole are distrustful, seeing them as oppressors who had controlled them for three hundred years, many worrying that some of these refugees could have been agents sent by the §RCollaborators§!. As time has shown, these fears have yet to come. \n\nIn 1962, the Scottish Republic is led by its founder and President §YJohn MacCormick§!, known affectionately as "The King" being compared to the Scottish kings of old. His protege, §YRobert McIntrye§! has served as his Prime Minister, as well as serving as the member of the SNP. However not all is well in one of the last bastions of democracy on the British Isles. §YMacCormick§! is growing sicker and sicker everyday, with his health declining. His death after leading the country for nineteen years could leave drastic results. As parliament discusses bills and other proposals, many of the Scottish people worry that their country could be in a paralyzed state after his death. However, some opponents have used §YMacCormick's§! nickname against him comparing him to the dictators of Europe due to his uninterrupted rule. \n\n While it may seem like a one party state due to the dominance of the §YSNP§! for the past nineteen years, there had been two other primary parties who had been biding their time, campaigning to gather representatives in the Scottish Parliament. At the forefront of the two is the §PIndependent Labour Party§!. In the chaos and uncertainty of the Fall of §REngland§!, the §PLabour Party§! had faced fractures and the slow demise. Many of its members had been arrested and detained by the §gGestapo§! as many fled to §BScotland§!. The §BScottish§! branch of the §PLabour Party§! needed reform to stay afloat in this new country. In this, the §PIndependent Labour Party§! was formed, however it had been on a decline due to the stunning popularity of the §YSNP§!. It looked as if it would dissolve until §PWilliam Wolfe§!, a former member of the §YSNP§! had joined and reformed them into the force they are today. \n\nThe smaller of the three, the §OUnionist Party§! led by §OPriscilla Buchan§! is seen more of a rump party than an actual competitor compared to the juggernaut that is the §YSNP§! and the growing popularity of the §PILP§!. However §OBuchan§! and her party are hopeful for the future. §OBuchan§! herself was a former member of the Conservative Party before arriving in §BScotland§!. After much consideration and funding arriving from a mysterious benefactor, the §OUnionist Party§! was formed.

Perhaps then it is inevitable that they would be subjected to the same depredations they inflicted on a thousand nations at the hands of §gGermany§!. §xEngland§! in this new and untested era is not the same place as it once was, for instead of the traditional power structures it is lead by a loose alliance of all those who want no more war with the Reich. The §gRoyal Party§!. Under §gAlec Douglas-Home§! the party has recovered greatly from the miserable days of the war and the chaos following the 1953 London Uprising by communist revolutionaries. §gHome§! leads the §gModerate§! faction of the RP, the largest portion of the coalition dedicated more to stability than any true ideals beyond that. At his side is §zHarold Macmillan§! and the §zReformists§!, who nominally adhere to democratic principles but are willing to compromise with §gHome§! for the good of §xEngland§!. Also present are the §OHardliners§!, dedicated fascists led by §OArthur Kenneth Chesterton§! who advocate for a state closer to the German model. Despite their differences, all three of these groups have been willing to work together for the sake of §xEngland§!'s recovery. But recovery doesn't meant stability, for another faction exists within §xEngland§!, §eHMMLR§!. \n\nHer Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance is a network of several different rebel groups all answering to one unknown man, allegedly called "the Boss". The organisation itself can be traced back to the aftermath of the 2nd World War, but it wasn't until the defeat and nigh annihilation of the Communist Party of Great Britain at the Third Battle of Cable Street that §eHMMLR§! rose to the fore of the English rebel organisations. §eHMMLR§! proper are dedicated to the return of the person they believe is the rightful monarch of §xEngland§!, Queen Elizabeth II. A somewhat conservative organisation, it is surprising that they allied with the second largest faction, The §RLeft Resistance§!. Led by §RBill Alexander§!, a veteren of the West Russian War, Spanish Civil War and a dozen wars in between, along with being one of the few notable survivors of Third Cable Street, The §RLeft Resistance§! are an eclectic mix of communists, socialists and even most of the old Labour Party united under a common banner and cause.

It seemed almost inevitable that it would grow to join the ranks of the §Wburgeoning superpowers§! of the §RUnited States§!, §RGreater German Reich§!, and §REmpire of Japan§!. A fourth superpower, bound tightly in friendship to §RGermany§!, which would surely see the spread of §WFascism§! world wide.\n\nThe fifties saw this dream of §GMussolini§!'s transform into a nightmare from which the country still has not yet fully woken. Strong Armed into aiding with the §RAtlantropa Project§! by §RGermany§!, §GItaly§!'s coast was ravaged, and the §Wadriatic destroyed§!, making way for nigh-useless §Wsalt plains§!. The §Weconomic crash§! that swept from §RGermany§! into Europe decimated §GItaly§!'s struggling economy - and then, finally, when the §RGermans§! had the gall to attempt to drag §GItaly§! into a war against a resurgent §RRussia§!, §GMussolini§! had decided §GItaly§! would no more suffer under German treachery.

He moved against the King, §GUmberto II di Savoia§!, and very nearly plunged the country into civil war in an attempt to depose the monarchy. The only thing stopping him was his son-in-law, §GGaleazzo Ciano§!.\n\nA devout Fascist, §GCiano§! had nevertheless watched with growing horror as §GMussolini§!'s policies plunged the §GEmpire§! into greater economic ruin and political strife. He stepped in between the King and the Duce's political rivalry, convincing his father-in-law to forfeit the struggle to end the monarchy; some say the Duce's death some days later was a mere coincidence, some say §GCiano§! took the safety of §GItaly§! into his own hands. Whatever the case, il Duce was dead, and §GCiano§! had risen to take his place.\n\nThe New Duce's immediately began to liberalize the §GEmpire§!, not out of any dedication to §WDemocracy§!, but out of sheer pragmatism. §WFascism§!, at least the methods of it §GMussolini§! had employed, had failed. §GCiano§!'s reforms walked back on racial laws, brutal colonial systems, and, perhaps most importantly, the suppression of Italian §WDemocracy§!.

Commanders such as §GGeorgy Zhukov§! and §GMikhail Tukhachevsky§! pushed the complacent Germans hard, breaking their line in several areas. For a moment, the whole of RK Moskowien seemed lost.\n\nThis moment passed, and the §RWest Russian War§! took a turn for the tragic. No one within the §GWRRF§! could agree what had cost them the initiative. Russian collaborating with the Reich; incompetence within the front itself; treachery from politicians in §WSyktyvkar§!. No matter the cause, the WRRF's offensive stalled out. The §RWehrmacht§! fought back desperately, slowly turning the tide against the Red Army. In this they were aided by collaborators, men flocking to the banner of the imperial pretender §WVladimir III§! and to the so-called §GArmy of Russian Liberation§! of §WAndrey Vlasov§!. Little by little the front was pushed back, until collapse.\n\nNow West Russia Remains as it was in the months following the end of the West Russian Wars, frozen in place by the Luftwaffe's cruel §Rterror bombing§! Campaign. In the north near §GArkhangelsk§! the remnants of the WRRF endure. Ageing Grand Marshal Voroshilov is expected to choose a successor; his likeliest candidates are Marshals Tukhachevsky and Zhukov. Sent to govern the military districts of Plesetsk and Ukhta, the generals' absence has done little to change court politics in Arkhangelsk proper. To the south of the Front's holdings lies the §GKomi Republic§!, a democracy born from a secessionist province of the Front. President Voznesensky has managed to steer the young nation mostly successfully, yet increasing political instability from the far left and far right threaten the republic. Nevertheless, komi holds a few trump cards of its own and is a contender for power in the region.\n\nSouth of the Front and west of Komi can be found §GVologda, Kostroma and Gorky§!. Once men of the Front, the soldiers in Vologda rebelled at the thought of continuing to fight fellow Russian soldiers. Since then they've attempted to sail a perilous course of diplomacy. In this they are aided by the wealth of Kostroma, a city state and important hub of black market trade with Germany. The final member of the trio of breakaway provinces, Gorky is home to some of the front's veterans armored division. Isolated from their former commanders, the men of Gorky live as bandit and raiders.\n\nFurther south can be found Vyatka and Samara. Captured by German collaborators in the dying day of the West Russian war, both regions hope to use their veteran armies to secure control of West Russia. The tsarists in §GVyatka§! at least hold on to imperial dignity, being led by the legitimate Romanov heir Vladimir III. Their rivals in §GSamara§! have nothing in the world but their own force of arm. Widely despised for their efforts to help the Germans win the §RWest Russian War§!, the men of the Russian Army of Liberation are cut off from their families west, and unsure as to their next objective.\n\nOther nation states try to carefully eke out a living in the ashes and ruins created by the endless German bombings. In §GBashkiria and in Tatarstan§!, local population waries of the resumption of a new Russian Civil war hope to be spared by the rising winds of war. In §WOnega§! the men of the §GAnti-Communist Volunteer Guard§! continue their endless watch. Forced by the Finnish Republic to serve as a wall between Finland's new land in Karelia and the Russian Anarchy, the men of the Guard await. Beyond their borders, the winds of war rise in Russia. Were the terror bombing campaigns to end, a new conflict to establish supremacy in Western Russia would begin. One likely to forge a new future for Russia.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Put and end to the warlord era, and unite West Russia under the flag of your choosing\n\n*Use your large population and powerful industrial base as a springboard to Russian reunification\n\n*Prepare to retake occupied Russian lands from Germany"
 
 REGIONAL_INFO_EUROPE: "§G==유럽==§!\n\nIt was not under the glorious banners of heroic men that Europe descended towards oblivion, nor was it the forward progress of the world that left all of Western Civilization scarred and deformed in the wake of the 1940's. Rather, it was the fear and terror inspired by the §gGerman Reich§! in its scornful conquests across the fields of France, Russia, and beyond. Everywhere one may look, the §gGerman Reich§! has brought about its influence, whether through its overlordship of a dozen European puppets leading a cleansing effort against the native populaces, or the gutted nature of the §OMediterranean§! following the failures of the Atlantropa project, all has been touched by the iron heart of Führer Adolf Hitler, self-described as the "Master of Europe."\n\n However, such a master does not bear the likeness of its subjects, nor the respect of its neighbors. Instead, the South of Germany finds itself tied into a massive Anti-German alliance known as the §OTriumvirate§!, intent on rebuilding the ruined European economy through the political gauntlet of §yItaly's§! upper chambers in the rapidly changing political climate of the insatiable Empire, the insufferable bureaucracy of Franco and Salazar's dual-dictatorship which breeds discontent among the populace of the §wIberian Union§!, and the distant, angered, wronged cries of the §rTurkish§! over foreign conquests denied from it for so long.\n\n However, such is not the only notable threats to the Führer's borders as well, as whispers of the storm of dissent hovering over the previously stormed lands of the §wUnited Kingdom§! has left the collaborationist government in fear of an incoming battle for their homeland, while the §jEast§! finds the many cultures of Slavs, Poles, and other large minorities waging a war of the underground against the many Reichskommissars and other collaborationist regimes operating in the Balkans claiming dictatorial, imperial dominion over their homeland.\n\n §gThe German Eagle§! has soared high over Europe, and greatly has this flight left it's wings burned; however, the fight is not over yet. Whilst the Reich brews in its own hotbed of sycophancy, betrayal, and competition for succession in lieu of the Führer's impending demise, a §PState of Shadow§! lies due East, biding its time, watching each and every move of the many states across Europe, plotting its own machinations in the wake of disenchantment from the Reich's failures.

 REGIONAL_INFO_ENGLAND: "§G==BRITISH ISLES==§!\n\nAn empire long united must divide. And an empire long divided must unite.

Invasion sundering the nation apart. \n\nChief of the nations in former §PGreat Britain§! still is §xEngland§!. Though once at the head of an empire which spanned the globe, in the modern era §xEngland§! has fallen on hard times. The collaborationist government of the §gRoyal Party§!, a loose alliance of those unwilling to risk the ire of Germania, governs the country in a decidedly undemocratic manner. Nonetheless, under the leadership of §gAlec Douglas-Home§!, the collaborationists have managed to piece together a functional administration for the first time in years. Yet not all the men of §xEngland§! submit to the §gGerman§! yoke. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, the §eHMMLR§!, are the foremost group in the struggle against fascism. A mix of communists, monarchists and everything in between §eHMMLR§! is united almost solely by their mutual antipathy for the collaborationists and all who serve them. But the balance between these two groups is precarious, and who knows what could happen should the international stage move erratically?\n\nIn the north the §MRepublic of Scotland§! holds out as the last truly democratic nation in the isles. Formed not by treaty but by the rogue Field Marshal Wimberley and John McCormick's §YScottish National Party§! as a last bid to ward off advancing §gGerman§! forces, §MScotland§! is an eclectic mix of exiles, natives and soldiers that share only their hatred of the Reich and all who serve her in common. Yet despite existing for nigh on two decades the Republic is fundamentally unstable, riven by divides between nationalists, unionists and other parties still. The future of Scotland is dependent on that of §xEngland§!, and whether an independent Scotland is the future or a blip on the historical radar is yet to be seen. \n\nTo the west of §xEngland§! lies the nation of §GWales§!. Forcedly separated from §xEngland§! during the course of the treaty of surrender, the Welsh have attempted to rebuild their nation which hasn't existed in over seven centuries, to varying results. Internally the Welsh are even more split by the matter of unionism than their Scottish brethren, with parties all across the political spectrum holding a variety of opinions on the matter, the only consistent agreement being that a union at present would be disastrous. A potential issue in the future of Wales though might be with their primary export. The coal mines of the Welsh primarily export to §gGermany§! after all, and were something to interrupt this it might prove disastrous for the fledgling celtic nation.\n\nAcross the Irish Sea, the §yRepublic of Ireland§! eeks out a meagre existence as the second of the §gUnity§! §gPakt's§! allies in the British Isles. Aiding the Germans in their conquest of §oNorthern Ireland§! during the course of the Second World War, the Irish have few friends to be found outside the §gPakt's§! influence. With the situation growing ever more unstable in Europe however, the future of the emerald isle is an uncertain one, and is likely to be impacted heavily by whomever emerges victorious in Britain. But the Irish people are not known for giving in to inevitable results, one way or another the English will find that out firsthand when the time comes.\n\nBritain is a land of chaos, a land of unrest, a land of opportunity.

With it's crushing victories in the Greater East Asia War, the Imperial State commands the loyalty of the liberated nations previously under the colonialist yoke, and the attention of the world. Her warring fury had swept across the east in a marvelous strike of military prowess and imperial strength. However, Tokyo's grip over its new client states is waning, and §edrums of war§! beat again.\n\nTo her north and west stand the §PEmpire of Manchuria§!, a loyal ally and puppet of the Japanese, and the §wRepublic of China§!, an increasingly rowdy satellite state angered by Tokyo's dominance over the east. To the south, the nations of §RIndonesia, Syonan§!, and various others pay homage to their Japanese allies, but the fires of revolt and rebellion burn louder and faster with each year that passes. Nonetheless, on the surface, Japanese hold of the Pacific is firm and secure, only threatened by the vexed postulations the Americans in the east and Germans to the west.\n\n§OThe Co-Prosperity Sphere§!, a geopolitical organization set up to hold together Japanese prizes from conquests, stands tall over Asia to unite the liberated nations under the leadership of the Imperial State. IJA garrisons stand to defend Japan's allies, marching from the banks of the Amur river to the jungles of Bengal, and IJN fleets patrol the eastern waters to guard from foreign incursion.\n\nIt is 1962, and Tokyo rules over The East. The New Order has resettled differences between nations and peoples, with entire civilizations now faced to bear witness to the might of the Rising Sun.

 REGIONAL_INFO_WEST_SIBERIA: "§G==서시베리아==§!\n\nWith the death of the §GSoviet Union§! came the birth of the §WWest Siberian People's Republic§!, a Bolshevik state headed by the authoritarian §GLazar Kaganovich§!. Assigned to the isolated region under Bukharin, Lazar wove webs and forged alliances that put him at the helm of an iron nation. But with time came vengeance, so when §GWest Russia§! launched its infamous war against the §Rfascist aggressor§!, the Republic stood by. But with war came defeat, bitter loss that took its final toll upon the Russian people. City after city, civilization collapsed into anarchy, out of which arose idealist states and the stuff of nightmares.\n\nThe West Siberian People's Republic was thrown into chaos as well, suffering from a lack of initiative and back-stabbings against Kaganovich's regime. The collapse came with no surprise, fracturing into petty warlords:\n\nIn the center sits the steel city of §GTyumen§!, below which gather armies in preparation for the next war. Smoke bellows from massive factories to the sound of marching feet, soldiers heading in one direction, resettled peasants in the other. §GKaganovich§! and §GKhrushchev§! cling against hope that they may repudiate their past mistakes. But to the North lies a greater adversary - §WSvedlovsk§!, commanded by the aging §GGeneral Konstantin Rokossovsky§!. A father to his men, the military junta wields a powerful army but remains relatively apolitical. In its crosshairs is Tyumen, and next, all of  Russia. In the South, hugging the wastes of Kazakhstan, sleeps a monster of great malice. The spartan city of §ROmsk§! extends its bony grip across Western Siberia, rallying men whose mere names conjure fear. Like a chessmaster, the §RBlack League§! calculates its every move, but whispers speak of death and a succession crisis.\n\nHigh atop the mountains sits the §Ymerchant republic of Zlatoust§!. Content with one of the largest military complexes in Russia, the merchants of death help arm the armies which may one day lead to their own demise. But the Republic is also home to innovators, its stability and justice attracts many refugees. New rifles pour from modern assembly lines - anyone who wishes to obtain the treasures of the Mountain will have to come and take it. But Zlatoust is not alone - in the North is the §WThief Territory of Yugra§!. A country without laws, ran by bandits and thugs, Yugra launches constant raids for food and ammunition.\n\nCornered against the icy sea is §WVorkuta§!, remnants of the Vortukan Corrective Labor camp. One of the largest §RGULAGs§! in Russia, its prisoners freeze before the guards, themselves confined to ancient structures, feeding on scraps. The last 'warlord' are the §WFree Aviators§!, remnants of the Soviet air corps. Unique in its leadership, the Aviators do not have a functioning government - rather, they are a collection of airfields, the last line of defense against the Lufwaffe's endless onslaught. The Aviators command respect from all factions, but their numbers dwindle every day, until there will be none left. Rumours of Hitler's imminent death and the Pakt's collapse may halt the terror bombings, paving the way for a war of national reclamation.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Mobilize the industry and rally your armies to rebuild Western Siberia, either under the Crimson flag or the Black League.\n\n*Utilize superior industry to conquer Western Russia when the time is right, but do not forget about the Southern Urals.\n\n*Gear for the inevitable war against Germany."

 REGIONAL_INFO_CENTRAL_SIBERIA: "§G==중앙시베리아==§!\n\nCentral Siberia once stood defiantly as the §WCentral Siberian Republic§!, the world's eyes on its capital §WTomsk§! as the young nation strove confidently into the future. Holding most of Russia's remaining industry as a result of Bukharin's Central Siberian Industrial Plan, the Republic was seen as the likeliest candidate for Russian Unification.\n\nIn the end however, it was not German Fascism but the inability of Russians to work together that brought down the nation. Internal strife and a foreign invasion broke the back of the Central Siberian Republic, leaving a myriad of successor states in its wake.\n\nTo the South West, the §WFederation of Novosibirsk and Barnaul§! plots to make good use of its agricultural land and heavy industry to reunite the region. Legendary ace pilot §WPokryshkin§! and his junta had a first row seat to the collapse of the old Republic. They plan not to repeat its mistakes. East of the federation one can find §Wthe Principalty of Kemerovo§!. Led by §WKing Rurik II§!, the small statelets blend of medieval Russia and modernity leaves many confused. Some write off §WRurik II§! as a mad old fool. Others note that his well ran state and well trained army is likely to play an important part in future events.\n\nEast of §WKemerovo§!, another breakaway state led by a former §WCSR§! general can be found in §WKrasnoyarsk§!. The shaky democracy's future is uncertain; what is clearer is that §WNikolai Andreev§! and his fellow mutineers will fight tooth and nail to maintain their independence. Meanwhile, to the §WPrincipalty's§! south one can find the mountainous §WKarakorum Government of Oyrotia§!. Cut off from the §WCSR's§! central government, the small nation of Altai people and Old Believer refugees have united in their effort to avoid bloodshed and oppression for their religious beliefs.\n\nEast of §WKrasnoyarsk§! lies an expanse of villages and free cities. Imagining the area undefended would however be a dangerous mistake, for the §WSiberian Black Army§! zealously defends the region. Adherents of a particularly militarized variant of anarchism, the leadership of the §WBlack Army§! plots its next moves. All of Russia must be freed from statist oppression, beginning with Central Siberia.\n\nFinally to the north, the rump of the §WCentral Siberian Republic§! controls the city of Tomsk and the vast arctic expanses beyond. Many have written off the city of artists and thinkers as soft, decadent and unable to contend with the loss of a majority of its army to secessions and rebellions. Nevertheless, §WPresident Pasternak§! has not given up.

## Mod Features
 MOD_FEATURES_TEXT: "§W================\n==모드 구성==\n================§!\n\n§Y==경제==§!\n§W더 뉴 오더: 라스트 데이 오브 유럽§! 모드는 복잡한 §W경제§! 매커니즘을 가지고 있습니다. 당신은 §W생산§! 탭과 §W건설§! 탭 사이에 있는 §W달러 아이콘§!을 통해 경제 개요를 볼 수 있습니다. 당신이 플레이하는 국가의 경제적 토대는 §GGDP§!이며, 이것이 국가 번영의 가장 중요한 열쇠에 해당합니다. 국가의 §GGDP§!는 반드시 §R부채§!와 균형을 이루여야 합니다. 매년 당신의 §R부채§!에 해당하는 이자가 비용으로 지불되며, §GGDP§! 대비 §R부채§! 비율이 너무 높으면 재정의 붕괴가 올 수 있습니다.\n\n불황기를 피하기 위해서는 당신의 §G수입§!과 §Y지출§!을 주의깊게 살펴야 합니다. 당신의 §G수입§!은 여러 가지 요인으로 결정되는데, 제일크고 가장 확실한 요소는 당신의 §GGDP§!입니다. 하지만 이외에도 국가 내의 산업, 빈곤율, 교육 수준 등등 매우 많은 요소가 수입에 영향을 줍니다! 반면 당신은 모든 경제학자의 골칫거리라고 할 수 있는 §Y지출§!도 가지고 있습니다. §YE지출§!은 군사 유지비, 사회 복지, 건설 프로젝트 등과 같은 요소의 척도라고 할 수 있습니다.\n\n§W더 뉴 오더§!에서, 제일 중요한 것은 균형을 맞추는 것입니다. 무분별한 §Y지출§!은 빠르게 높은 수준의 §R부채§!로 이어질 수 있으며, 이는 빠른 시일 내에 부실 경제와 §R경제 위기§!로 바뀔 수 있습니다. 반면에 신중하고 주의깊게 경제를 이끌면 높은 수준의 §GGDP 성장§!, 여유로운 지급준비금, 또한 국가의 밝은 미래도 가져다 줄 수 있습니다.\n\n§Y==커스텀 GUI==§!\nMany of the countries in §WThe New Order§! feature expansive §GCustom GUIs§! designed to add more depth to your §Rgameplay experience§!, and make peacetime gameplay more interactive. §GDecision Custom GUIs§! are built directly into the §Ydecsisions tab§!, and can be accessed simply by opening the tab. This includes the §WTomsk Duma GUI§!, the §WSouth African Referendum GUI§!, and §Rmany§! others!\n\nOn the other hand, §GFull Custom GUIs§! are accessed via the §Ypolitics tab§!, using a button located below your §Wcountry leader's portrait§!, next to the §WHead of Government's portrait§!. These §GFull Custom GUIs§! tend to be much more in-depth, and are oftentimes vital to a country's §Rgameplay experience§!. This includes the §WUnited States Voting GUI§!, the §WSpeer Zollverein GUI§!, the §WJapan Legislature GUI§!, and §Rseveral§! others. Furthermore, most §GCustom GUIs§! also feature an §Yinfo button§!, which, when §Rhovered over or click on§!, will display helpful information on how the interface works and other features of the §Rintegrated mechanic§!.\n\n§Y==OVERHAULED WAR==§!\n§RWar§! features heavily in §WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§!. Players lead a military of the Cold War. Units have been nearly completely overhauled from Hearts of Iron IV. Helicopters and Air Cavalry ease ground attack and troop movement, and new tech trees devoted to §RAir Cavalry§! warfare have been developed. Armor featured in the mod is modern, with §GMBTs§! taking the mainstage on the battlefield and an entirely new armor setup. Players, however, should not forget about infantry and mobile infantry technologies. Armor and air technologies are no replacement for boots on the ground! \n\nOn the coasts, new naval technologies like §Rmodern aircraft carriers and stealth ships§! control the seas. TNO's reworked naval tech uniquely reflects the dynamic nature of warfare in the Cold War. In the air, the player may advance in bomber and fighter technologies that have been added to simulate the unstable world and wars of The New Order. \n\nPerhaps the most important decision any player must make is the future of their §Rmilitary doctrines§!. The introduction of long guerilla wars changed how wars were not just thought about, but fought. The blitz of the Second World War is no more, replaced by long slogs in hostile terrain. Victory is no longer a certainty, and a player's choices must reflect this. §ROrders of Battles§! have been changed and units shifted around to reflect this reality. §WThousands of new generals§! have been added to give the player a diversity of characters to lead their armies.\n\n§R==Mutually Assured Destruction==§!\n§WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! ultimately takes place during a Cold War, and not a World War. Each of the major three nations: §Wthe United States§!, §WGermany§!, and §WJapan§!, enjoy full §Rnuclear triad capabilities§! as of 1962; locking the world under the fear of §Rnuclear holocaust§!.\n\nAs such, nations are ultimately at the whim of the §Gsuperpowers§! of the world, and they are forever locked against one another without the means to secure an easy victory. Any war between the three §Gsuperpowers§! will inevitably be §RWorld War III§!.\n\nWhen §RWorld War III§! is fought, it can not end well. The sides will fight until one side begins to falter. If a nation feels that it is about to collapse, is unable to continue a war, or has their core territory overwhelmingly threatened then §Rnuclear war§! is an inevitability. If a nuclear strike is launched, it will be a matter of days until thousands of nuclear weapons are deployed in the war. If this happens, it is §Rgame over§!! Luckily, diplomacy is the norm. §RNuclear war§! is rare, extremely so if not playing as a nuclear power, and most nations would rather work through issues instead of fight over them. The §WDEFCON§! tracker in the §RWorld Tension§! menu in the top right will tell you how high the §WDEFCON§! level is globally. The higher this is, the more likely that diplomatic options will fail. At max levels of §WDEFCON§!, war is inevitable.\n\n§Y==PROXY WARS==§!\nThis does not mean that war is uncommon in §WThe New Order§!. On the contrary, war is actually §Gextremely common§! and you will fight several as almost every nation. However, wars are not expressed through direct conflict, but instead normally as §RProxy Wars§!. §RProxy Wars§! are wars between two nations, who are backed by two larger nations using their conflict as a way to battle one another without an outright battle. These can also occur during §RCivil Wars§!, which are also exceedingly common.\n\nDuring a §RProxy War§!, nations at war with one another may find themselves being supported by an outside power. If nobody is playing as the backing power, then units will be gifted to the nation fighting the war. If a player is the backing power, however, they will be able to support their side via the §WVolunteer System§! as in vanilla §WHearts of Iron IV§!.\n\nBe careful however! Proxy wars are dangerous prospects, and can rapidly increase the §WDEFCON§! level! §R'Diplomatic Crisis'§! may be common, and possibly influenced by external actors. One wrong move, and you can cause global destruction.\n\n§Y==DIPLOMATIC CRISIS==§!\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! are randomly fired throughout the duration of many wars and §RProxy Wars§!. A §RDiplomatic Crisis§! is an event chain showing an increase in tension that can escalate to full on global war. Traditionally, this means an event is fired for one §Wparticipant§! in a conflict, allowing them to take some form of lose by backing down from the crisis or gain by pushing against the other power. The defending power will then get the opportunity to do the same, and escalate further or back down. This continues for some time, with the reward increasing but alongside the loss, until one side buckles and backs down. If no side backs down, §Rthis will spark war between both sides!§!\n\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! become more common the higher the §WDEFCON§! level is, and can also be fired during peace time! Remember to put the safety of the world before pride, or to exploit the game of powers in order to encourage the conflict...\n\n§G==NARRATIVE==§!\n§WThe New Order§! and its demo are a §Gnarrative§! based mod. This means that the mod is more story based than any other for §WHearts of Iron IV§!\n\nWhat this really means is that the gameplay loop of §GHearts of Iron IV§! is very different from the one of §WThe New Order§!. Gone is the linear build up towards a war with the option to choose an ideology before then, with an occasional event fired to give you a small boost. Instead, you will be navigating a country much like a §W'Choose Your Own Adventure'§! novel. While there will be plenty of opportunity for war, gameplay decisions, and many many nations have their own mechanics to learn, ultimately the feeling is one of playing a story.\n\nSo please, sit back, relax and enjoy the story while you work through your country. Paths should generally be self explanatory and if you find yourself overly confused please let us know and we'll see what we can do to make it easier in the future. We don't anticipate too much issue though, so enjoy the game, and let us know what you think!"
