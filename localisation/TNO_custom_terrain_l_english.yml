The Atacama Desert, on the other hand, is a true Plateau of Death.\n\nAmong the the hottest places on Earth in the day, and among the coldest at night, the Atacama is one of the most unlivable ecosystems on Earth; south of the town of María Elena, it is supposed by modern science that there is literally zero non-human life. However, despite the aridity, despite the temperature flux, despite the thin air from the elevation, the Atacama is one of the most starkly beautiful places on the planet. It is trite to compare it to an alien world, and yet, there is no better comparison to make. It is not a place meant for human life, and to gaze upon the endless badlands is to gaze upon the forbidden face of God.§!"

Originally a small coastal town, LA began to grow rapidly towards the end of the nineteenth century, continuing unabated through World War 2 and even the 1950s following the Japanese seizure of the port. As the home of Hollywood, LA has earned a reputation as a land of glitz and glamor, though the diverse and often impoverished neighborhoods of the growing city are on the front lines of America's civil rights movement.§!"

As one of the two Japanese concessions bordering the American mainland, the port of LA is a constant hotspot of world tension.

Countless different cultures have taken root in the city, long a relative safe haven for oppressed peoples from all over the world from tyranny in their distant homelands. Equally attractive as the open mindedness of the city, however, are its open markets, being one of the premier centers of international business and finance as well as the greatest display of American economic might.

Such freedom is not fought over for the denizens of this city, but fought with, in the halls of Congress, where issues of undeniable importance are fought over and where the future of the nation as a whole is decided.

But it took on a far greater significance in the last half-century: the cradle of the Nazi Party.\n\nFollowing the German defeat in the First World War, München was a chaotic place, as two competing revolutionary socialist governments clashed with the Freikorps in the streets. It was in this environment where a small group of nationalist ideologues and disgruntled veterans coalesced to form the German Workers' Party. One of its members, an Austrian-born veteran named Adolf Hitler, would climb the ranks and become its leader, transforming it into the National Socialist German Workers' Party. It was in the beer halls of München that Hitler built his first power base, and launched his failed putsch in 1923. It was where the Nazi Party established their national headquarters. And it was where Hitler convinced the British and French to cede him Czechoslovakia to secure a peace he had no intent of keeping. München remains a bastion of Nazism today, and he who is most influential in it has the key to the Nazi heartland.§!"

The city has also, in better times, been known for its extensive, beautiful and varied architecture from roman ruins to gothic cathedrals to art deco.\n\nAll of this has been erased by a much more sinister, modern Burgundy.

Growing tension between Chile and Bolivia over territorial disputes and a Bolivian tax on Chilean nitrate mining companies would culminate in the 4 year long War of the Pacific. Chile, despite the odds, defeated the combined Bolivian and Peruvian armies over the course of the war, ultimately gaining the resource-rich Bolivian coastline, including the city of Antofagasta.\n\nNow, Antofagasta is the center of one of the world's largest nitrate and copper mining operations, and modern innovations in the field of electrochemistry mean that the mining companies have begun to tap into the region's large lithium reserves.

With a history dating back at least 3,000 years, Chongqing has often been at the center of Chinese politics, with many governments having the city as their head. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chiang's Kuomintang was one such government. Being the head of operations for the Chinese and American armies in China and South East Asia, Chongqing faced heavy bombing by the Japanese. While much of the population was able to take refuge in air-raid shelters, the cities industry was hit hard by Japanese attacks, and when Japanese troops finally occupied the city during the waning stages of the war, there wasn't much left.\n\nOf course, Chongqing's population wasn't content with a ruined city. Chongqing's position in the Sichuan basin gave it ample resources to rebuild, and together with its large population, Chongqing was able to rebuild faster than most Chinese cities. Of course, to end here would be telling only half of the story. Far away from Nanjing and the central government, Sichuan has often been difficult for the RGOC to control. Communist guerillas, Kuomintang hold-outs, and unhappy peasants are in near-constant uprising and make Chongqing's wealth much harder for the central government to exploit. Unlike in other provinces, such as Shanxi, Nanjing is much more unwilling to give the riches of Sichuan to a power-hungry warlord. This arrangement means that while Chongqing is a city full of wealth and industry, it goes unused and unavailable. Controlling Chongqing, and by extension, the Sichuan basin, is a requirement for any Chinese government to succeed. "

That was until 1919 and the advent of the 21 demands, seeing Japan cement its hold over German operations in Shandong, including the vital Jiaoji railway that connected Jinan to the sea. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Jinan was targeted early on in the war due to its strategic importance. In late 1937, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River and began marching towards the city. Chinese troops abandoned Jinan and were ordered to burn down government buildings, as well as the Japanese consulate. The ensuing power vacuum led to Jinan descending into chaos. Japanese forces arrived in the city less than a week later, quelling the chaos and beginning their harsh occupation. Jinan, being developed by both German and Japanese investors in years past, had large industries that the Japanese took full advantage of for their war effort.\n\nAfter the Japanese war economy began to demobilize and move out of the area, failings of the new central government began to arise.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the combined forces of Yan Xishan and Communist general Zhu De were able to put up stiff resistance to the Japanese in Taiyuan, with the Japanese remarking that "nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately". After the capture of Taiyuan in late 1937, the Japanese exploited Taiyuan to its fullest extent. Taiyuan was able to supply the IJA well in its campaigns to root out the Communist base areas in Northern China. Taiyuan saw little growth during this time, as resources and material were shipped out of the mountains of Shanxi and into the war machine of Japan. Due to its manufacturing importance, Taiyuan was going to be an important city for the new central government to control.\n\nUnfortunately for the RGOC, the situation on the ground was becoming less and less favorable for the central government. Unable to control the outer reaches of China, the new government allied with Yan Xishan, granting him de facto control of the province.

In 1938, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in full swing, the Japanese army descended on Xuzhou, sending panic through Chinese high command. The defense of Xuzhou was rushed, and while they showed early success in nearby battles, the situation was determined unwinnable and orders for a general retreat were given.
