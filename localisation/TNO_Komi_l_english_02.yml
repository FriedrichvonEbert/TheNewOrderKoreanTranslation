 komiintro.0.d:0 "코미 공화국은 러시아 무정부 상태의 군벌 중에서는 극히 드문 민주주의 국가입니다. 폭격이 일상적인 서부의 국가 중에서는 거의 유일하게, 공화국은 공식화된 경제와 정치 시스템, 그리고 서러시아에서 볼 수 있는 자유 선거에 가장 가까운 것을 가진 독립 국가의 역할을 하고 있습니다.\n\n서러시아 전쟁의 여파로 공화국이 건국된 이래, 이전까지 식팁카르를 병들게 했던 정치적 폭력에 종지부를 찍음으로써 공화국은 굳건히 서 있었습니다. 공화국은 비체그다강에서 뱟카강까지 국경을 접하고 있으며, 코미의 경제는 천천히 그리고 꾸준히 성장하고 있습니다. \n\n하지만, 공화국의 설립은 식팁카르와 코미 지역의 근본적인 문제를 끝내지는 못했습니다. 식팁카르는 서러시아 전쟁 기간 전선의 통치 기구의 중심지로서 참혹하고 결정적인 역할을 하는 곳으로 명성을 얻었습니다. 이전의 정치범 수용자들과 사상가들은 그들의 감옥을 운영하던 권위가 해체되자 자유롭게 도시에서 그들의 일에 전념할 수 있었습니다. 게다가 서러시아 각지에서 온 정치적 망명자들이 공화국으로 흘러들어왔으며, 뱟카에서 온 공화주의자들과 사회주의자들, 아르한겔스크에서 온 우익들은 공화국의 수도에서 어떠한 방해도 받지 않은 채 돌아다니고 있습니다. \n\n코미는 민주주의로 잘 알려졌지만, 자유의 장소로서 이러한 평판의 결과는 준군사단체의 준동이라는 어두운 면을 얻게 되었습니다. \n\n식팁카르의 거리는 정치적인 준군사단체들의 폭력과 저항, 그리고 폭동에 의해 악명이 높습니다. 1963년 말 두 번째 전국 단위 선거가 다가오면서 이 폭력은 점점 더 커지고 있으며, 공화국의 많은 시민은 과연 코미에서 민주주의가 생존할 수 있을지, 아니면 러시아의 다른 군벌들과 같이 전제주의의 지옥에 떨어질지 의문을 품고 있습니다."

DSNP가 우리들의 연합을 박살내는 꼴을 보십시오. 난 이 상황을 용납할 생각은 추호도 없습니다!" 이건 위험할 수 있었다, 연합의 분열은 선거에서 그들의 성과를 심각하게 손상시킬 수 있었고, 그렇게 되면 급진주의자들이 권력을 얻을 수 있게 될 수도 있었다. 코시긴은 뭔가 해야만 했다.\n\n"친구 여러분, 그리고 동료 여러분, 여러분들의 두려움을 이해합니다. 진심입니다. 저 또한 극단주의에 대해 보즈네센스키가 취한 일련의 입장들에 회의적입니다. 그렇다 하더라도, 공화국이 필요로 하는 것은 연합의 단결을 위협하는 것이 아닙니다. 대신 우리는 대안을 찾아볼 필요가 있습니다." 코시긴은 잠시 말을 끊었다. "보즈네센스키는 한동안 우리 공화국을 이끌었고, 코미는 폭격에도 불구하고 그의 지도하에 계속해서 성장할 수 있었습니다. 하지만, 제 의견을 말하자면, 코미는 새로운 리더가 필요할 지도 모릅니다. 코미가 앓고 있는 홍역을 진정으로 치료해줄 사람 말입니다. 선거가 곧 다가올 것입니다. 여러분, 그리고 우린 함께 민주주의를 지지하는 사람들 아닙니까?" 코시긴은 다가올 선거에 대해 많은 생각을 해왔고, 대통령이 되겠다는 생각은 점점 더 유혹적으로 느껴졌다. 어쨌든 그의 작은 연설에 동료들은 기뻐했고, 현재로서는 재앙을 피할 수 있었던 것 같았다."

"자넨 설마 전에도 날 죽이려고 시도한 이들이 단 한 명도 없었을 것이라 생각한건가?" 아나톨리는 코미의 그늘의 실력자를 조롱하기 위해 그의 입술을 열었으나, 그의 목구멍에서 흘러나온 것은 훌쩍임 뿐이었다. 수슬로프는 고개를 저었다.  "안타깝군. 구밀료프의 어린양들은 대부분 자네보단 굳세었던 것 같은데 말이지." \n\n 그는 다시 방아쇠를 당겼고, 아나톨리는 더는 아무것도 볼 수 없었다.\n\n수슬로프는 그의 의자에서 일어나, 여전히 연기가 피어오르던 권총을 그의 외투 안으로 밀어 넣었다. 그의 경호원이 방 안으로 뛰어 들어오자, 그는 그에게 시선을 고정했다.

"네 아버지가 자랑스러워하실 게다." 그들은 "그분이 널 볼 수만 있다면~" 이라고 말하곤 했다. 그녀는 미소를 지으며. 늙은 니콜라이의 발자취를 따르겠노라 약속하곤 했었다.\n\n그녀는 그렇게 멍청하지 않았다. 이 회의는 분명 생산적인 회의였다. 비록 공산당의 다른 이들이 생각한 이유만은 아니지만 말이다. 그것은 그녀에게는 단순한 만남이 아니었다. 오히려, 이것은 코미의 진정한 위협이 누구인지, 그리고 더 중요한 것은, 어떻게 그들이 제거될 수 있는지를 배울 귀중한 기회였다. 방금 그녀에게 말을 걸었던 그 남자는, 그녀에겐 약간 만족스럽게도, 겁쟁이였다. 그녀가 사소한 논쟁에서 그와 의견이 다른 순간, 그는 단호히 뒤로 물러나며 사과했다. 그런 사람은 추종자에 속하지, 지도자감은 아니었다.\n\n아니나 다를까, 세로프는 그녀를 유심히 관찰했다. 물론 그는 무시무시한 남자였지만, 그러나 그는 그의 먹이가 자신과 같이 그를 주의 깊게 지켜보고 있으리라 생각하지 않았다. 그녀가 가장 관심을 가졌던 것은 그가 정통 공산주의 이론에서 벗어난 것이 분명하다는 점이었다. 그의 말투는 스베틀라나에게 그녀가 과거에 시달렸던 나치의 프로파간다를 떠올리게 하였다.\n\n공산당은 한계에 이르렀다. 그녀가 밤이 끝날 무렵에 내린 결론이었다. 단결을 지속시키고자 하는 즈다노프와 수슬로프 들이라도 모든 이들을 통제할 수는 없었다. 그녀는 세로프가 결코 마지막까지 남을 리가 없다고 추론했다. 어쩌면 그가 첫 이탈자가 될지도 몰랐다. 당의 새로운 떠오르는 스타는 많은 사람에게 환영받는 광경이 될 것이며, 이는 연방의 영광스러운 시절이 모두 사라진 것은 아니라는 확신을 사람들에게 심어줄 것이었다.\n\n스베틀라나 부하리나는 그렇게 될 것이었다. 그러나 그녀의 사랑하는 아버지와는 달리, 그녀는 러시아가 그녀의 손가락 사이로 미끄러지는 것을 용납하지 않으리라."

 NIK.2.t:0 "Stalina Advocates for Stronger Measures"
 NIK.2.d:0 "My fellow Deputies, the enemies of our republic lie around us. They lurk in the darkness, awaiting their opportunity to strike at our foundations and collapse the structure that has held this nation together. We cannot wait! We cannot wait for them to enact this evil plan! We must make the first move - and battle them through any means necessary."\n\nAlthough the sounds of applause filled the chamber almost immediately from Stalina's portion, hushed whispers and glances dominate the rest of the group. The measures Svetlana puts forward are extensive, and involve different varieties of actions against 'enemies of Komi', such as further powers of the ruling party of the legislative chamber, the ability to carry out arrests without warrant of said enemies, and some rumor that, outside of the legal powers, Svetlana will further fund her allied paramilitaries in order to help control the nation. Whether that is true or not, however, does not matter. Svetlana has already made her move."
 NIK.2.a:0 "Could it be necessary?"

 NIK.3.t:0 "Disorder from the Left?"
 NIK.3.d:0 "A malaise hangs in the air for the leftist bloc. Since Stalina's proclamation of destruction of the enemies of Komi, activity has become different than usual. Impromptu, emergency meetings between legislators and paramilitary members. The politicians move unlike anyone has seen them before - with haste and alarm. The meetings, too, show a great change in mood: the whispers grow in number, the applause grows less certain, the glances become only more and more worried.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries, too, show bizarre behavior. Their movements are further mixed up, the graffiti on walls becoming less and less prevalent, and the members themselves encrypting their communications however they can. The presence of trouble is in the atmosphere - and the reasoning is not difficult."

 NIK.5.d:0 "Following Kosygin's speech, the legislation chamber took a five minute rest and discussion period. To the followers of Voznesensky, however, it seemed like Russia would be reunified before the break would be finished. Discussions in hushed tones dominated all sections of the chamber, but nowhere did it happen more than in Voznesensky's section. As the break reached its end, Voznesensky rose up from his seat and made his way to the podium.\n\n"Kosygin, your plan of action in this chamber do not help us, the party, or the Republic. What you are suggesting is only dividing us further, and constitutes as creating your own alliance with Miss Stalina. I officially condemn your statements. That is all."\n\nWhile some applause rang out, the majority of the Deputies reacted in silence.\n\nAs dusk approached and the session wrapped up, Stalina and Kosygin stayed behind in the room. Their words few, but their motivations plenty, it was agreed on with a simple handshake. An alliance to protect each other, and to serve the republic - through whatever means necessary."

 NIK.6.t:0 "Unity, for Now"
 NIK.6.d:0 "After the session and Kosygin's controversial speech, two stayed behind in the legislative chamber. The two most influential democrats, the economical masterminds of Komi, the fire and saviours of the Republic must meet.\n\nAlthough the purpose was a brief negotiation, both men proceeded to lose track of time. By the time they finished, it was already near-midnight. However, following a final, genuine handshake, the negotiations were complete. In exchange for Kosygin retracting his statements, Voznesensky would, at a later point in time, send through measures that were more effective. Both men came out of the meeting satisfied, as their party would remain strong - strong enough to withstand any coming political storm."

No more connections, no more ties, no more association. Voznesensky would be free.\n\nCalling a trusted courier into his office, he ordered the young man to send the letter straight away - his purpose would be official state business, and the contents classified. He placed faith in the deliverer to complete his task timely - for Voznesensky did not know how long these ties could last before being thrust, in an intrusive display, to the unaware public.\n\nThe young courier nodded his head at the command, and was dismissed straight away. His duties were evident to both men, and it was best for him to start accomplishing it. As he left, Voznesensky smiled. Relaxed now, he sat back into his chair and muttered."

The leaked documents detail the extent of the connections, highlighting the relationship between Zhdanov and Voznesensky and showing the amount of collaboration.\n\nThe Voznesentsi has been completely shattered by the news, as highly tempered debates run wild in the meeting minutes and legislative sessions following the story being broken.

For a solid minute, anarchy ruled over the chamber as arguments began over Voznesenky's true loyalty, only ending when the head of the session declared order be held in the assembly.\n\n"These ties have existed, yes. But these ties are now cut. And they will remain cut for good. My loyalty is not to Zhdanov, but to this Republic we preside over. I implore you all to consider this.

Somewhere in Voznesensky's eyes, a glitter showed up.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky, the votes have been counted... by a margin of one hundred and twenty two to seventy eight, you have been found absolved of any crime revealed by these documents presented before us."Voznesensky couldn't help but crack a smile.

 NIK.12.d:0 "Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nThe result was quick to arrive.

Voznesensky's expression was neutral throughout the vote, revealing nothing of his inner mind or plans. But his expression did not matter anymore. His fate has been sealed, for the talks of removing Voznesensky from power have already begun in the room - and they show no signs of letting up."

 NIK.13.t:0 "Covering the Evidence"
 NIK.13.d:0 "The sounds of whitewashing broadcasted itself to an almost empty woods. As the shovel dug on, and the briefcase stood firm in the slight moonlight breeze, the man couldn't help think of the circumstances that led to this point. He had obtained the documents, yes - he sent loyal assistants to take care of that. Without anyone knowing, he had slipped out of Syktyvkar during the dead of night, indeed - he arranged it on an official 'private outing' for the next few days, and he thought, at least, no one suspected the wiser.\n\nThe waxing gibbous and a flashlight was the only sources reflecting on his face, yet on his soul reflected much. But his resolve was clear. He must not let this come to light. Otherwise, too much would be at stake. It was for the good of the Republic, he imagined, as the shovel did the last shoveling of its dirt."

 NIK.14.t:0 "A Leak into a Downpour"
 NIK.14.d:0 "Voznesensky placed his head down on his desk. An unfortunate courier had delivered news of another set of documents revealed to the public. Not the first time the news was brought to him, Voznesensky simply sighed and dismissed the messenger, muttering a curse word to him under his breath.\n\nEver since the evidence was disposed of, the Republic, and the Voznesentsi in particular, have been wracked by yet another political crisis. This one, however, struck the party nerve to the limit. The anonymous source has not slumbered, as new documents and evidence are leaked daily to the Party and the public. Suspicious of Voznesensky due to him not testifying and seeing less of a necessity politicians loyal to him grow fewer by the day.\n\nIn addition to this, rumours have surfaced of even further ties to Zhdanov, to the point where both men would be comfortable with each other in a meeting, swapping jokes as a socialist revolution is plotted. While these are only rumors, they have still dented the reputation of the party, and threaten to destroy entirely the relative internal peace within the legislation chamber."

 NIK.15.t:0 "Hunting the Source"
 NIK.15.d:0 ""Gentlemen and ladies of the party. The accusations that befall me are quite obviously untrue. Yet despite this, these rumors continue to flow, and damage our wonderful republic. Due to this..."\n\n"This man is a traitor!" outbursts a Deputy, and the entire chamber erupts into chaos. The evident loss of trust in Voznesensky within some sectors of the party continues to manifest itself, until a screech drowns out the arguments and brings order once again to the room.\n\nHolding his microphone, Voznesensky continues. "Now. These rumors are false, yet they damage us. We cannot allow the source of these rumors to continue shrouded in darkness. An investigative committee must, and will be formed. This investigation will encompass any suspected spreader of these rumors. Whoever it is, we will find them, and justice will be served."\n\nThe members, coincidentally Voznesenky's most trusted advisors, have already been selected, and the investigation now begins."
 NIK.15.a:0 "Come out, come out..."

 NIK.16.t:0 "The Party Compromised!"
 NIK.16.d:0 "Voznesensky and his investigative committee glanced at each other with suspense. Progress has been minimal so far into the investigation, and no leads produced conclusive results.\n\nThe tension was shattered with the bursting of a door, and the rushing of a committee member into the room. "The damned Soviet bastards! They're watching us!"\n\nThrough an informant with more loyalty to Voznesensky than previously thought, a sweeping revelation came to the attention of the committee: the party - specifically, Voznesensky's own wing of the party - had been infiltrated by spies. Further questioning revealed that these spies were under the command of none other than Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, suspected leader of the many socialist and communist parties and paramilitaries in the Komi Republic.\n\nAfter being told the news, Voznesensky mirrored the faces of the rest of the committee: near-panic. A decision had to be made quickly in order for the agents not to find out - crack immediately down on them, or wait and see what to do next?"
 NIK.16.a:0 "Drop the hammer!"
 NIK.16.b:0 "There will be no hasty moves."

 NIK.17.t:0 "The Democrats' Purge"
 NIK.17.d:0 ""The vote is passed. The expulsion of these agents will begin in due process, with no exceptions."\n\nMany members of the democratic party began to sweat. The purge of suspected "agents working for Suslov" began shortly after, with police storming into the legislative chamber and beginning to arrest previously suspected agents. While some offered resistance and admitted themselves, most kept quiet, regardless of their true affiliation.\n\nAfter the arrests were made, Voznesensky made his way to the podium. "Friends of Komi, we can no longer tolerate foreign agents, spies, and traitors in our ranks. This is not the end. More of Suslov's spies are watching us right now. Any so-called Voznesentsi of mine will be subject to further investigation to ensure they are truly loyal to the republic. That is all. You are all dismissed early for the day. Remember where your loyalties should lie.""
 NIK.17.a:0 "How many could there be?"

 NIK.18.t:0 "Svetlana Urges Caution"
 NIK.18.d:0 "After the events of the previous session, the democratic Deputies were in a state of hysteria. Accusations flew like never before, hostility was palpable, and all worried about the ties of even those persons sitting right next to them. The loss of unity in the party troubled Svetlana Stalina, and not articulating her own thoughts on the situation would be a grave mistake for the party. After a politician's speech on "destroying the Suslov agents", Stalina took her turn to speak.\n\n"Distinguished Comrades. The situation that has developed in this room does not play to our advantage in the slightest. Instead of questioning the circumstances that led to the documents being leaked, you all assume that the leaker is somewhere in this room, right now. I beg of you to consider this alternate option: the leaker, as he is called, has not, in fact, leaked anything. Rather, it is an organized plan by our enemies - a plan to destabilize our precious democracy by framing someone who has not done anything wrong with crimes against the state. I should know this, because that's what I would do."\n\nLoud mutters filled the chamber at this point, with all eyes weighing up Stalina in disquiet. "I believe that this could be a conspiracy, a conspiracy that will send us crashing down in flames. Please, think about it."\n\nThe murmurings in the chamber eventually ceased, and some token applause was offered. Most, however, were worried by Stalina admission that a conspiracy as they feared was not beyond her means. Perhaps it would be best not to think on it too deeply."
 NIK.18.a:0 "Ironic."
 NIK.18.b:0 "She isn't wrong."

 NIK.19.t:0 "A Plot!"
 NIK.19.d:0 "The committee members were sure of it. Right there lied the evidence, the proof needed to end this debacle once and for all. A Voznesentsi politician by the name of Nikita Yakovich has been accused of orchestrating the release of documents to the public, as well as spreading rumors that damaged the reputation of Voznesensky himself. Confident in their work and relieved that this emergency may finally come to an end, all but one headed out to begin the proceedings.\n\nHis original purpose was to take one last look at the documents, to oversee his vision for the case: start to finish, the evidence complete. But as he glanced over the document, a detail caught his eye. Didn't it say Yakovich and Zhdanov meet in Yb, where no one would notice yesterday? But this interview here with Yakovich's secretary said he was in the office the whole day. And this detail here is incorrect... and that one... and...\n\nThe committee member widened his eyes. In their haste, they had made basic errors in finding the leaker. The evidence that did implicate him was planted - a set-up. Rushing out of the door, forgetting his hat, he desperately went out of the room and into the night, hopeful to find any way to halt the proceedings... before an innocent man is punished for a crime he did not commit."
 NIK.19.a:0 "Can we stop it in time?"

 NIK.20.t:0 "A Smoking Gun"
 NIK.20.d:0 ""Nikita Yakovich, your attention. Deputies, to attention."\n\nWhen the news spread that the leaker that had caused much tension and damage to the democratic coalition had been found, the politicians lit their torches. Following a midnight raid by police on Yakovich's home, seizing him in a state of sleep and reading to him his charges in a courtroom, he was personally sent on Voznesensky's orders to the legislative chamber in order to assure his party that all was well, and that the troubles would be over.\n\nAs Nikita repeatedly pleaded his innocence, to no avail, Voznesensky pointed to the trembling man. "This man - a traitor of the republic and a spy for Suslov - is the man that has caused us great suffering in our legitimacy and in our Komi! Shame onto this man, for he is the leaker - and the evidence has been gathered to prove it!"\n\nAt an undisclosed location, an advisor speaks to one Mikhail Suslov on the news. A slight grin creeps onto his face, his eyes alight with the feeling of yet another pawn moving forward. "Excellent."\n\nVoznesensky took stock of the situation in front of him. He had already privately dismissed the charges against him in court. No, no, the court would not do. He would deal with him personally. But in which way?"
 NIK.20.a:0 "Expelling him will be sufficient."
 NIK.20.b:0 "Call Yuri. Send a message to the rest."

 NIK.21.t:0 "Blackmailing the Problem"
 NIK.21.d:0 "Nikita Yakovich had enough common sense to realize something was amiss. His trial was dismissed. While the police were always nearby, they did not take action against him. While the politicians jeered and glared at him, he was still allowed to conduct limited political duties. It did not click, however, until the night of his retirement.\n\nThe chorus of glances, whispers, and outbursts declaring him an enemy of Komi that had been the drawl of a legislative session had concluded. He was tired and miserable, like the days before, ever since he had been accused of crimes against the state. Arriving at his home, relieved that it had not been destroyed by a German bomb yet, he sat down on his living room chair and lit the fireplace.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Opening it, he was surprised by the man standing before him: Nikolai Voznesensky himself. "I have come to have a talk with you, Nikita."With no other choice but to invite his guest inside, Yakovich gestured towards him to take a seat beside him at the fireplace. Both men sitting, Voznesenky went straight to the point.\n\n"Quite clearly, Yakovich, your crimes against the state have been appalling to the rest of us. And it would be a shame if something were to further ruin your reputation. Like these pictures, for example..."Yakovich's skin turned a pale white. How did he get those...? "The way I see it, Nikita, you have two options. The first is the merciful one. You will resign from your post as Deputy at once. Or... you can tell your wife-"Yakovich capitulated, agreeing to his demands. The political career of Nikita Yakovich was now over."
 NIK.21.a:0 "Just what he deserves."

 NIK.22.t:0 "Nikita Yakovich Found Dead!"
 NIK.22.d:0 "The Deputy sat in front of his fireplace. His tea boiled, and his watch read half past eight. Looking around, a figure stood in front of him-\n\nA flash. A bang. A thud. Nikita Yakovich went dead silent.\n\nNews from Syktyvkar today, as alleged leaker of damaging documents related to Voznesensky has been found shot dead inside of his home. The Deputy's watch was reported to have stopped around dusk, and according to the autopsy, appeared to have died immediately from two bullet wounds, one to the head and the other to the heart. However, despite the gruesome shooting leaving a mark on the public consciousness, there is still no evidence of the identity of the killer, nor if there was a motivation behind it. It seems another senseless killing has plagued our republic...\n\nVoznesensky laughed at the news report. Yuri had done his job well, as expected. His immediate payment would include a bonus, even! He was feeling generous today. The leaker is dead. And that is what mattered."
 NIK.22.a:0 "He will not be missed."

 NIK.23.t:0 "The Innocent Verdict"
 NIK.23.d:0 ""He wasn't there that Thursday, Nikolai. That's the only thing that needs to be said and our whole structure of power could come tumbling down."\n\nThere were very few times in his life that Voznesensky had been genuinely shocked. Not since the fall of the Union has a realization hit such a poignant note in the politician. This man was innocent. Free of crime. No evidence that holds up. And he had put him out of his job.\n\nNews today reports that the murdered politician, Nikita Yakovich, alleged to be the leaker of state and personal documents, has been declared innocent of all charges. Already, protests have begun to be dispersed by Voznesensky-aligned paramilitaries, and the legislation is determining on their next course of action.\n\nVoznesensky was at a crossroads. He had to do something. But what?"
 NIK.23.a:0 "An innocent on our conscience."
 NIK.23.b:0 "Retract the story!"

 NIK.24.t:0 "Voznesensky, in the Presidium, with the Hit Squad!"
 NIK.24.d:0 "A verdict has been reached in the death of one of our former delegates, and the man who gave the order to have him killed.\n\nFar from what we originally expected, Yakovich was innocent, a victim of one of Suslov's plots to tear down our coalition. Our own Voznesensky, however, had plenty of warning to the contrary. Both Alexei Kosygin and Svetlana Stalina have testified against him in our own internal court, stating that he had ample warning that Yakovich was innocent, and the evidence didn't quite line up. Despite this, he went on with the kill order anyway, and had Yakovich buried in a shallow grave.\n\nThe internal opinion of the Party has shifted radically away from the disgraced Voznesensky, and closer to the ascendant Kosygin and Stalina - the right-center coalition containing our most experienced, and most importantly, less rampant, politicians.\n\nFar from standard procedure, this is an act of murder, and one that sets a dangerous precedent. His penalty shall be a vote of no confidence, and, if cast down from his chair, full legal processing at the hands of his replacement."
 NIK.24.a:0 "You should have listened, Nikolai."

 NIK.25.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
 NIK.25.d:0 "Voznesensky stood before the podium. One hundred and ninety nine faces looked upon him, some with mixed feelings, most others with hatred in their eyes.\n\n"Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. You have been charged, with substantial evidence, of high crimes against one Nikita Yakovich, and against the Komi Republic. As a result, a vote of no confidence will be levied against you, and a replacement shall be nominated if the vote passes."\n\nVoznesensky started to become drenched with sweat. He had rolled the dice, and he had gotten snake eyes. The question of his survival as leader now was ever-so-present within the nation and the National Assembly. Would he last?"
 NIK.25.a:0 "Out with the old?"
 NIK.25.b:0 "Out with the old?"
 NIK.25.c:0 "Out with the old?"

 NIK.26.t:0 "Deprecated"
 NIK.26.d:0 "Voznesensky looked down at his feet. The vote for confidence in him was about to begin, and as he reflected upon himself, he still believed that his policies were still best for the nation. He hoped that they would understand that.\n\n"By a vote of one hundred and sixteen to eighty-four, the National Assembly has declared that you are in no confidence to lead this assembly any longer, Nikolai Voznesensky. Now we begin the process of voting for your replacement. Good day. Take him away, guards."\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, an unexpected candidate, Alexander Belozerov, has been voted in as President! A conservative politician, Belozerov was never the type of person to be cast into the spotlight, instead diligently representing the small center-right wing of his party. However, a combination of previous Voznesensky supporters, having more in number than expected during the no confidence vote, deciding to vote for Belozerov out of dislike of either Kosygin or Stalina, as well as the Stalina and Kosygin blocs devolving into fighting between each other, thus making them unable to unite behind a single leader.\n\nWhile Belozerov, in his acceptance speech, claims he will unite the republic and bring order to the congress, many Deputies, even those within his own wing, see him as an ineffective choice for President, and such a President may even allow for something as drastic as the fall of democracy in Komi..."
 NIK.26.a:0 "A new name to learn..."

 NIK.27.t:0 "Kosygin Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.27.d:0 "Voznesensky gazed at the ceiling, not even bothering to see the expressions of his comrades. Did it matter who supported him at this point? What was the point if everything he worked for was ruined? All he could do is await his verdict.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky. By a vote of one hundred and sixty-nine to thirty-one, you have been removed from office effective immediately. Security will now escort you out. Have a good day, sir. The voting for your replacement will now begin."\n\nThe choice for President has been decided: Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin, a well-known economic mastermind and representative of his liberal wing of the democratic party, accepted his new post today as the President of the Komi Republic. Vowing to steer the republic without influence of the more radical ideologies inside of it, his experience and age has made him an ideal pick for those seeking stability and democracy after Voznesensky's fall from grace. While he is slightly more right-wing than Voznesensky, his desire to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi still beats. The legislation has reacted rather favorably to the news, with plenty of applause being present during and after his acceptance speech. It seems a new dawn of democracy has shined on the Komi Republic."
 NIK.27.a:0 "A change for the better?"

 NIK.28.t:0 "Stalina Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.28.d:0 "Voznesensky wore the scowl on his face proudly. How dare those traitors throw him to that horde of angry politicians? After all he did for this glorious republic. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and this republic will fall to the ground because of them.\n\n"The hands that call for his removal are... one hundred and forty-three... the hands that oppose are fifty-seven. Voznesensky, by the voting of this National Assembly, the government of the Republic has expressed no confidence in your leadership. Your replacement will be voted on now. Security, escort this man out."\n\nIt is official: Svetlana Stalina has been made President of the Komi Republic. Managing an upset victory, her acceptance speech pledged that any threats to the order of the Republic would be annihilated, and that democracy shall flourish under her watchful eye. While most of the chamber reacted to her speech with cheers and applause, very strangely, some of the Deputies with closer ties to Stalina were reported to have looks of worry on their face. Whatever the reaction is, however, there is no doubt about it - the Republic has a new leader, ready to steer the country to greatness."
 NIK.28.a:0 "Let's see how she does."
 
 NIK.2800.t:0 "Voznesensky Endures!"
 NIK.2800.d:0 "Voznesensky, stoic, gazes blankly at the roof of the chamber. Here was a man disgraced by his own comrades. Here was a man who had lost his sense of morality. Here was Nikolai Voznesensky, leader of democracy in Komi - but, perhaps, not for much longer. The party will decide his fate.\n\n"The time has now come to vote on confidence in comrade Voznesensky's leadership. If you are in favor of comrade Voznesensky, please raise your hand now."As the hands were raised, some politicians glanced at each other. Whispers broke out within the legislative groups, and worried looks appeared on faces throughout the room. Voznesensky perked up, his eyes narrowed and his heart pounding.\n\nMore amount of hands were showing than he thought. Perhaps even half of the chamber!\n\n"And... if you are in favor of removing comrade Voznesensky from his position of power, raise your hands."The Deputy in charge of counting was perplexed. The margin was very narrow, but it seems no one voted twice... and democracy was democracy.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky... by a vote of one hundred and three to ninety-seven, you have been declared still fit to hold this position of office..."Uproar immediately broke out throughout the chamber, only silenced by the incessant banging of the gavel. Voznesensky felt weak. Somehow... he was still the President. Even though by a thread, loyalty and confidence in him was still present. Nikolai resolved himself. His job was to lead the Republic. And so, he will."
 NIK.2800.a:0 "How does he survive?"

 NIK.29.t:0 "Discrediting the Leakers"
 NIK.29.d:0 ""Overwhelming firepower. That's how we'll destroy these leaks. If the damned Germans were able to destroy the Union with it, I'd say it would work well here."\n\nThe meeting continued on after that suggestion, but it seemed no other idea resonated as greatly. The leaks had damaged the democratic party's reputation, and fast solutions were needed in order to try to stop the ship from completely sinking. A giant media blitz is proposed as the answer - the propaganda machine will never stop turning, and it must not stop - otherwise, the leaks may doom our chances of survival.\n\nEach and every leak will be analyzed and discredited, providing some sort of evidence that the document contains falsities and lies. And so, we shall churn out our great campaign - to defend democracy. Of course, some may say that all these fact-checks are untrue, even within our own party... but these naysayers wouldn't want their own files to be left out of the analyzation process, after all. All will be in agreement."
 NIK.29.a:0 "Truth? It does not matter."

 NIK.30.t:0 "The Party Fades"
 NIK.30.d:0 "The analyst looked, and looked again. No matter how many times he analyzed the figures, success was simply not there. The discrediting process was supposed to work, wasn't it? They said this was a bright idea... and yet these numbers say otherwise. Should he burst the bubble? He thought about it a bit. Despite his fearfulness of consequences, he figured that the party deserves to know the truth - no matter what it says. He called his supervisor over and showed him the paper.\n\n"We have a problem. This poll given to us by an analyst shows our support is dropping. Not by a lot, mind you, but still enough to be concerning. I've already fired him, of course, but it is still something we have to pay attention to."\n\nThe meeting attendants looked at each other with an amount of worry. Voznesensky, the chair of the meeting, responded back.\n\n"These numbers do not show anything significant. It is indeed a temporary setback, but it's not like the Germans are invading Syktyvkar. We will debate how to fix this - if you all believe that it needs to be fixed - in a legislative debate tomorrow. Meeting adjourned. Stop wasting my time with this crap.""
 NIK.30.a:0 "A small price to pay."

 NIK.31.t:0 "The Popularity Debate"
 NIK.31.d:0 "As the gavel banged and the session began, all eyes shifted to the candidates selected for debating the course of action on the declining poll numbers, and what to do to fix them. With each party in the coalition all holding their own positions on what to do in this situation, the debate was guaranteed to be a long and intense one. Each candidate, as per debate custom in the chamber, was asked to begin with an opening statement describing what they would do to fix the declining support of the democratic parties among the people.\n\n"The fact that we are having this debate at all is a sign that the coalition has become full of worriers and defeatists," the DSNP candidate begins. "Numbers like these go up and down all the time. One dip does not mean we must make a crisis out of it. Next person, please."\n\n"Democracy is virtuous - but it is fragile, when faced with extremism and growing disregard for the very foundation of our Republic." Stalina comments. "It is constantly under siege from those who wish to destroy it. Radicalism is the enemy of our republic, and only God may know what these radicals will do if they are granted access to our leadership positions. We must not allow concessions to these fascists and communists, in the name of preserving our homeland from hatred and tyranny. That is all."\n\nIt took barely a second for Kosygin to reply in kind, staring down at the audience. "Thank you. Stalina is correct that we must safeguard ourselves against the radicals. However, not all of the radicals are unshakable in their beliefs. I believe that if we speak to the more democratic socialists, for example, and the less authoritarian rightists - the uncommitted citizens who have been unfortunately waylaid by impossible promises - we may be able to draw them into support for democracy. My statement is done."\n\nAs the figures began their debate, the observers watched with interest, some taking notes. However, they could only choose one winner of the debate. They believed that..."
 NIK.31.a:0 "Voznesensky is correct."
 NIK.31.b:0 "Kosygin has the best argument."
 NIK.31.e:0 "Stalina presents the optimal solution."

 NIK.32.t:0 "The Voznesentsi's Solution"
 NIK.32.d:0 "As the debate concluded and the regular - albeit mandatory - applause filled the room, the democratic delegates were asked to select a 'winner' of the debate on slipping popularity numbers.\n\n"Comrades of this assembly. Now is the time to count these votes, and determine the actions of this party in regards to the numbers crisis."\n\n"By a margin of thirty-five, Comrade Voznesensky's plan... or rather, the lack of one," he muttered under his breath, "...has been passed."\n\nVoznesensky's ideas were simple. If there is no action needed, there is no problem. Polls are simply that: polls. The numbers will always move back and forth, and there is no reason to assume that this will change. If the nature of the polls do not change, then there is no reason to change anything. And after all, if there is no action needed, there is no problem. Democracy would go on, and Komi would be blessed by the continued rule of the democratic party. All from not overreacting to one stupid poll."
 NIK.32.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.33.t:0 "Soyuz Molodih Reformatorov's Solution"
 NIK.33.d:0 "The applause echoed across the chamber. The debate was over, and now was the hour for choosing what exactly must be done to save the democratic parties from losing their grip on Komi, before it was too late.\n\n"Comrades, the vote will now begin. Please vote for the candidate you agreed for the most. And not the person you would die for, please."\n\nWhile the last part was whispered to himself, the voting process commenced.\n\n"By a margin of forty, Comrade Kosygin's plan will be put into motion."\n\nAlexei Kosygin is a rational man. While he believes that democracy will always have its hardcore opponents, he also knows that some of those who simply question democracy may be convinced, through certain methods, to reconcile with the democratic parties. Kosygin's plan involves less harsh anti-radical measures than Stalina's, and also tries to recapture those who are closer to democracy back. Polarization will be stopped, and the poll numbers will return to normal - maybe even higher - levels. Under his hand, democracy shall reach salvation."
 NIK.33.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.34.t:0 "Demokraticheskiy Vybor Rossii's Solution"
 NIK.34.d:0 "Following the debate and usual applause that came with its end, the delegates were asked to vote on the 'winner' of the debate, and in turn, decide the plan that would end the falling popularity of the democratic party.\n\n"Delegates of this dear republic, it is now time to begin our voting for this debate's winner. Decide and cast your vote now..."\n\nThe delegate's inflection was one of uncertainty. "The leader of the vote, by... a margin of twelve, is... Comrade Belozerov?"He couldn't hide the confusion from his face.\n\nNo matter what the reaction was to his plan, Belozerov was one to stick to it. In his view, while radicals on both sides of the spectrum were a threat to democracy, his belief was that the leftist socialists and communists would be much harder to defeat. The only way to break them was to work together with the right. With his negotiations, Belozerov can cause the right to ally with him, thus having enough influence and power in order to take down the left. This would drastically improve democratic poll numbers, and would also secure democracy against the leftist threat. Once the leftist threat was defeated, Komi would be free."
 NIK.34.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.35.t:0 "Stalina's Compromise"
 NIK.35.d:0 "After Stalina spoke her closing statement, the clapping of hands - albeit a little forced - echoed in the room. The debate had concluded, and now, the delegates had to make their choice on the course that the party must take to combat falling poll numbers.\n\n"Comrades of Komi, the voting process for the winner of these debates begins now. Please cast your votes."\n\nAfter a moment, the moderator looked at the box. It wasn't even close.\n\n"By a margin of forty-seven, Comrade Stalina's plan has been passed."\n\nStalina is a woman who was determined to defend democracy. In her view, Komi can only be saved if the enemies of democracy were to be struck down before the radicals could strike and destroy the foundation of the republic. Anti-extremist measures will be passed, further democratic-oriented "citizen's informational media" will be published and spread, and certain orders will be given to paramilitaries in order to secure the democratic control of republican-aligned districts. Each and every method needed to safeguard democracy will be applied, with full effort and full power behind it. And, with this, in her eyes - the republic would be saved."
 NIK.35.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.36.t:0 "A Message from Zhdanov"
 NIK.36.d:0 "The letter was a simple message. Near the Gribnoy Pereulok, eleven thirty in the evening - sharp. Bring a briefcase. Comrade Zhdanov. Voznesensky scratched his head. Sure, meetings were secret between the two - that much was obvious. His briefcase, however, he would have to find. But that shouldn't take too long...\n\nLights were scarce in these troubled times for Syktyvkar. There were enough aerial problems in the day, after all. The imposing silhouette of the Gribnoy Pereulok shadowed over the dark alley he was assigned to meet him at. Right on cue, a figure shows. Comrade Zhdanov has arrived.\n\nThe conversation was short." I have for you something that might be of interest to the democratic party. Take these. "He shows Voznesensky why he needed the briefcase: papers, and plenty of them. All stamped with the seal of the Communist Party of Komi."
 NIK.36.a:0 "You're welcome... comrade?"

 NIK.37.t:0 "Taking the Internal Files"
 NIK.37.d:0 "Zhdanov glances at Voznesensky as the papers ruffle and shake to the movement of the breeze. The leader of the Republic did not hesitate as he took the files and inspected them. The first document, however, did not promise much. It was essentially a list of names of important, non-rank and file members within the Communist Party, something already known to him. Was this intelligence junk? Other papers were in the pile, of course, but if the first document that was shown to him was obvious information, then hopes were minimal that the rest of them were any better. On the other hand, these files were still important pieces of information, even if copies or already deducted. Surely, keeping backups would be important..."
 NIK.37.a:0 "What could go wrong?"
 NIK.37.b:0 "We've seen this one before..."

 NIK.38.t:0 "The Informational Arsenal"
 NIK.38.d:0 "Walking to his residence, Voznesensky swung his briefcase in his dominant hand. While these files were probably still worthless, it was good to check anyways; they can be used as future reference quite well. As the man went to his home, he stopped at the door and put down the briefcase containing the files. Another stack to put in the archives, he supposed.\n\nLighting the house and, out of paranoia, checking to see if anyone was peering at him, Voznesensky set down the case and opened it. As he saw and, perhaps expected, the first file was something already known: a name list of important figures of the Communist Party of Komi. No specialities. Settling himself in for a long night of bureaucracy, he flipped to the next page - an inventory of armaments in a depot outside of Syktyvkar. Blinking, he almost went to the next page before he stopped himself. He stared at the page - was this a prank? Was this even official? Yet... there was the seal of the Communist Party, and a stamp that marked it as top secret. This information wasn't junk.\n\nIt was a goldmine.\n\nQuickly flipping to the next page, wondering if it was new or old, he saw the title. 'Operatives Monitoring Democratic Activities:' This was certainly new, and was also a small shock. Why would Zhdanov...? No matter! Voznesensky had the tools he needed now to defeat the left: their names and weapons, cataloged and able to be weaponized to the fullest extent. He dialed a number on his telephone and rang - "Grigorenko. Come to my house immediately. I have something that might be of interest to you.""
 NIK.38.a:0 "Perfection!"

 NIK.39.t:0 "Better than the Others"
 NIK.39.d:0 "Voznesensky thought about what Zhdanov was offering him. Sure, they were internal files of the Communist Party of Komi. But Zhdanov was not a man who he completely trusted. And considering that the first file was nothing but already-known junk, he did not have high hopes for the rest of them. Even if they were files that revealed damaging information, what would he be then? Just another plotter in the shadows? Komi has enough of those already. He would become another Gumilyov, or Suslov, and his followers would be known as Voznesenskyites to even his own party. He knew that a couple of old and worthless files was not worth losing party unity for. No matter how he put it, there was no way to justify taking these documents.\n\n"Zhdanov, comrade. I apologize, but there is no point in me taking these documents. They do not help me at all. Thank you for your consideration." He awaited Zhdanov's next words."
 NIK.39.a:0 "Thanks, but no thanks."

 NIK.40.t:0 "Suslov's Secrets"
 NIK.40.d:0 "Voznesensky looked over at the document with a stone-cold expression. Next to him was Petro Grigorenko, his Chief of the General Staff, and Yegor Ligachev, his security minister. All three of them were discussing the documents that had been seen so far, with only two left to go over together. Already, orders had been sent to police around the Republic to prepare for seizure and securing of Communist assets, and appropriate arrests had been carried out in secret. The spoils of these documents had almost been fully reaped, and it seemed that all was almost finished in action.\n\n"Comrades Ligachev, Grigorenko. These two documents and we're finished. Let's see what else is in this pile."The second-to-last document was unearthed from the stack of papers: a long-term operational plan ordered by and carried out by Yuri Andropov, one of Suslov's lieutenants. After a coup of the democratic government, the operation states that the Communist party would expand its territory to other warlord states nearby, eventually taking over much of the old Union."\n\nThe three men glanced at each other before reading the next document: a conversation between Arvids Pelshe, a key figure on the left, and Suslov. After reading the document, which seemed more like Suslov giving orders to his inferior, the three men discussed it.\n\nFollowing their discussion, they agreed to gather the briefcase and guard it in a secure place, where none could see the machinations inside."
 NIK.40.a:0 "A treasure worth any price."

 NIK.41.t:0 "A Plan Foiled?"
 NIK.41.d:0 "Zhdanov looked over at Voznesensky, retracting his hand and putting the documents away. The two men locked eyes, yet Voznesensky did not see the Zhdanov he usually saw. Avoiding eye contact and looking around, Zhdanov muttered out a few words, perhaps of gratitude, or of regret - but Voznesensky could not tell - and slowly backed away from him. Was Zhdanov planning something, and his plot was now defeated before it even started? Did Zhdanov want to sabotage his party and he stopped it from happening? Could he possibly be even hurt emotionally by the rejection - a close friend betraying him?\n\nAs Zhdanov quietly phased out into the darkness, Voznesensky was left alone with the stars to contemplate."
 NIK.41.a:0 "Perhaps we'll never know."

 NIK.42.t:0 "Zhdanov's Favor"
 NIK.42.d:0 "A little after the clock struck twelve did the call come in. Voznesensky grabbed it with no haste, expecting yet another legislative matter, or perhaps an associate clearing up a request. Repayment was not on his mind, however, when he picked up the phone.\n\n"Comrade Voznesensky, this is Andrei! I hope you have obtained the material and kept it safely."Voznesensky didn't expect the call, but that was fine. A small chat with Zhdanov about the materials, in fact, would be a wise thing to do. "Indeed, I have! Thank you, Comrade Zhdanov. Now, our meeting-"He was interrupted by Zhdanov's next words. "Ah, Nikolai, yes, our meeting. Speaking of that, did you think that I would just give you the documents for free, old friend?" Voznesensky was silent after that, wondering just what he signed up for. "You see, Nikolai, there is a certain organization that has been talking to me. They say that they are being hunted down by your paramilitaries, in fact, and would very much not like to be hunted down by your paramilitaries. Now, Voznesensky, I am aware that you do have the power to fix this, correct? And that I also expect to see it fixed. The All-Komi League of Socialism and Communism would love to know they can sleep safely at night. Thank you, Nikolai."Before Voznesensky had a chance to reply back with any word, Zhdanov hung up. Now it was his turn to fulfill the end of the bargain."
 NIK.42.a:0 "Do we have a choice?"
 
 NIK.421.t:0 "Reporting for Duty"
 NIK.421.d:0 ""Comrade Oplesnin-..." The phone call failed, a common occurrence in Syktyvkar that the Deputy who once dispatched from the Halls of the Kremlin never quite grew used. Pestered, Zhdanov made another attempt: "Comra-..." This second call ended up sooner than the last one. Zhdanov would rather not make a call in the afternoon when all the few lines available are busy with bureaucrats trying to request papers from their managers. Still, the issue was too important to be postponed, so he dialed again. "Comrade Oplesnin..."\n\n"Comrade Zhdanov, is that you, my old friend?"\n\nOn the other side of the line, there stood a tired old man who seldom left his dacha these days, yet who, throughout the decades, saw more battles than half the Republic's military. General Oplesnin knew what Zhdanov wanted with that call. However, he didn't see himself as fit for action anymore; he had led his life like he led his battalions to the frontlines, marching forward with pride and effort only to be torn apart by enemy artillery. No one could be more tired of combat, pain, and glory. But then his eyes caught sight of his Order of Lenin at the wall, awarded by Zhdanov's hand, and set his mind remembering...\n\nThe triumph of the Revolution would be the only thing great enough to justify it. All that fighting would be a vain waste of many lives, including his own, if not redeemed by putting Russia at the hands of the workers. After some more dialectical confabulation, the general gave his caller what he wanted "Comrade Zhdanov, my life is at the hands of the Party."\n\nNikolai Oplesnin took his old uniform out of the closet and got himself properly dressed. If he would be a soldier again, he should make himself feel like one. His first battle would be against the General Staff's telephone.\n\n"General Nikolai Oplesnin, presenting himself for duty.""
 NIK.421.a:0 ""I am ready for any assignment.""

 NIK.422.t:0 "Nighttime Suspicions"
 NIK.422.d:0 "It was the dark of night when Pyotr Grigorenko, the Republican military's Chief of Staff, telephoned Svetlana Stalina. He had deliberated about the call for some time, worried that she would be disturbed from sleep, and thus unreceptive to his imperative.\n\nHe need not have been. Barely one ring had passed when the call was answered, and the voice all in the Republic knew well answered him decisively. Like himself, Stalina was most active during the nighttime hours, finding them free of distraction and an optimal time to accomplish work. Equally aware of her disdain for wasting time, he got right to the point.\n\nNikolai Oplesnin had been appointed to the Republic's General Staff. His General Staff. And he was most concerned. The man was both qualified and proficient, true, but that was not his worry. Oplesnin's past was. It was impossible to overlook his activities under Bukharin's regime and, thus, his potential ties with the WRRF.\n\nGrigorenko was both surprised and heartened by Stalina's immediate agreement. She shared his concerns, particularly those concerning the absolute necessity of preventing communist infiltration of Republican state organs. Oplesnin had to be watched, closely. They, therefore, quickly came to an agreement of coordination.\n\nIf only the Republic as a whole could be so decisive as Stalina was, Grigorenko thought as he replaced the receiver."
 NIK.422.a:0 "Keep a close watch."

 NIK.43.t:0 "The Chaos Increases"
 NIK.43.d:0 "The irregular sound of pistol shots and yelling helped set the tone for the meeting. Voznesensky, Malyshev, Grigorenko, and all of their associates were discussing the latest news: an uptick in street violence between left-wing and right-wing paramilitaries. Since more blood had been spilled onto the streets, the democratic party has been conducting meetings between them and their paramilitaries to see what should be done about this situation.\n\n"This is the perfect opportunity!"Grigorenko yelled, slamming his fist on the table in a display of masochism. "These idiots are fulfilling their blood lust against each other, and draining their numbers! If we go out into the streets now, then we should be able to destroy them all!""Why the hell should we risk injuring our fine men if they're injuring each other already?"Voznesensky replied back. "They'll just start using more drastic methods, maybe even killing each other. No need to deploy anything.""You two, as usual, assume that we have to do either everything to stop them, or nothing to stop them. Have you ever considered simply helping move the process along? Escalating the situation? Do certain actions and blame them on the opposing ideology? Strike from the shadows? These are the kind of things we need to do in order to succeed. Think about it."\n\nAs the screaming and the gunshots continued, the meeting wrapped up, a decision finally being reached."
 NIK.43.a:0 "One should not interrupt their enemy in the process of making a mistake."
 NIK.43.b:0 "Send them in, mop them up."
 NIK.43.c:0 "We shall be everywhere and nowhere."

 NIK.44.t:0 "No Need to Panic"
 NIK.44.d:0 "Huddled civilians cried and cowered in the shop. Outside were dead bodies, two associated with the left and five associated with the right. Blood stained the street and sidewalk, glass and weapons lying at the feet of the deceased. A new era of chaos in the streets and towns of Komi rules over the republic now.\n\nVoznesensky smirked at the news of the most recent confrontation, this time resulting in an unusually high amount of deaths. He was right after all - there was no course of action required. Now, they are killing each other directly in the streets, when before they had only injured each other. The process is happening even quicker than he thought. Soon, the problem would be eradicated completely as the paramilitaries wipe each other out. He sat back in his chair, enjoying the supremacy of his decisions. Nothing to worry about from here on out."
 NIK.44.a:0 "The problem solves itself."

 NIK.45.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.45.d:0 "Voznesensky did not see the changing of the situation at first. It was a slow process, a slogging ordeal for both combatants that left some dead and many more injured on both sides alike. But now, reports have come in from the democratic paramilitaries and the citizens of Komi. More and more, the injured and killed come from the right-wing paramilitaries - they appear more scared as they go to fight, less of Gumilyov's men show up to confront the leftist forces, and Gumilyov himself has been rumored to be in a state of disarray following a decisive defeat in Vilegodsk in which his forces have been completely driven out of the city.\n\nWhile fights are still ongoing in Syktyvkar, and the left-wing paramilitaries still suffer many casualties, it is now clear that the balance is tilting towards Suslov and his armies in the streets, which may prove to be a challenge in the future. But for now, Voznesensky pays it no mind. The right will come back from this minor setback, surely."
 NIK.45.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.46.t:0 "Red Stars on the Poll Booths"
 NIK.46.d:0 "He was blindsided by the news. He couldn't believe any of it. How were they able to do that? How...\n\nThe leftist radicals have declared victory in the streets. Following a particularly gruesome battle near the legislative building in Syktyvkar between Suslov's elite paramilitary unit and cobbled together volunteers of Gumilyov's forces, in which the winner was obvious, the rightist paramilitaries have showed up less and less. Gumilyov, for now, has been defeated in the paramilitary struggle, and although his forces fight on, none are sure he may ever be able to regain the strength he once had again.\n\nVoznesensky, upon hearing this, was about to burst into one of his characteristic tyrades when another piece of news hit: voters were now being intimidated by these paramilitaries. Electoral districts have shifted control from more democratic-leaning to fully leftist-leaning, and some communists have even had the audacity to graffiti red stars onto the polling booths, letting all who vote know who is nearby. Shifting, wanting to speak, wanting to explode onto the news bringer violently, he found that he couldn't. Wearily sighing, he simply waved the courier out of his room."
 NIK.46.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.47.t:0 "Embracing the Moderates"
 NIK.47.d:0 "The poll numbers are up, for once."Yet another meeting, yet another piece of news. At least this piece of news was pleasant. Voznesensky blinked and asked him to explain how this could happen when the radicals were about to stage their 'fair' election victory.\n\n"According to... well, a survey, yes, I know it's a survey, but just stick with me. According to that survey, many of them are people who are newly supportive of democracy. It seems after the violence was started by the radicals of both the left and the right, the moderates of both wings became terrified that they would be targeted both by the enemy and within their own ideology. Thus, they now flee to us for their safety and protection."\n\nVoznesensky was at least glad that he might have a chance of surviving these next elections. Speaking some token words of approval he couldn't bother to remember, the meeting carried on."
 NIK.47.a:0 "Something good comes out of this."

 NIK.48.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.48.d:0 "The changing of the balance was something unnoticed at first. Yet, as time continued on, something seemed more apparent. Rumors were that Suslov had been showing up less and less to his meetings. The battles have gotten bloodier, the left-wing in particular becoming more desperate in their fighting methods. Apparently, the left-wing paramilitaries are being beaten back on the streets, with some fighting apparently even happening in fully communist-controlled areas.\n\nVoznesensky fidgeted at the news. While he knew that fighting would still go on for a long while, as the left is very equipped and powerful, it did not ease him to know that the right wing, with Gumilyov at the helm, is growing ever-more powerful in the outside world, away from the chambers of power. However, Voznesensky had faith in the left-wing paramilitaries. Surely, they will beat Gumilyov back, and kill each other. Surely."
 NIK.48.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.49.t:0 "Springtime for Gumilyov?"
 NIK.49.d:0 "Voznesensky could not believe what he heard. How was this possible? How did they do it? How...\n\nIn the streets of Syktyvkar and the small towns of the republic, the rightist paramilitaries are supreme. After an intense and hard-fought battle between Suslov's reservists and Gumilyov's elite, SS-modelled bodyguards, of which the winner was clear, the leftist paramilitaries have retreated from the streets, only showing up to protect certain key electoral districts and influential leftist figures. Although Suslov fights on, and with still much power to eventually wreak havoc on the right, Gumilyov has gained the advantage in the battle of Komi.\n\nVoznesensky began to cuss out the poor courier when he realized something. If Gumilyov has already taken control of several communist districts, that means he is very much able to intimidate voters in those districts, as well as democratic districts. In a 'fair' vote, Voznesensky would be defeated. Cursing out the carrier as much as he could, he knew that the end could be near for him."
 NIK.49.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.50.t:0 "Peace through Superior Firepower"
 NIK.50.d:0 "Grigorenko grinned as he saw the beautiful T-34. An old relic of the wars of Russia, yet still an effective killing machine, the commander was proud to say that this tank was now part of his paramilitary - and would drive the radicals out.\n\nWhen Voznesensky approved, reluctantly, Grigorenko's suggestion for equipping and sending out his paramilitaries to fight, he immediately went to work on preparing his forces for the battles ahead. New drills with new rifles. New tanks to crush the Suslovites and the Gumilyovites with. New powers to destroy the enemies of democracy.\n\nAs the orders were given to begin engaging fascist and communist paramilitaries, Grigorenko personally led his forces to the streets of Syktyvkar, ready to fight. Ready to win."
 NIK.50.a:0 "Do us proud."

 NIK.51.t:0 "A Cordial Request"
 NIK.51.d:0 "Voznesensky's work was interrupted when one of his secretaries entered his office. The stocky man nodded toward his boss and wordlessly made his way to the desk. "From Zhdanov" was his underling's only comment. Voznesensky did not bother to look up from the memo as the secretary closed the door behind him.\n\nZhdanov's message was polite. The cordial word to the president of the Republic succinctly made a case for the end of targeted paramilitary campaigns against the communists. For reasons of military security as well as to prevent radical elements from destabilizing the left. It would not do, after all, for communist citizens in Komi to see the government turn its back on them. Nor would it do any good to have brave communist soldiers gunned down by the government.\n\nVoznesensky's eyes were still on the memo when his underling brought his afternoon tea. Deep in reflection, the politician thanked his secretary, but did not lift his eyes off the message."

The wind's whimsy brought it under a new propaganda poster. A brutish soldier stood poised to stab worker militiamen from behind. From the soldier's shadow, a twin hydra of fascism and conservatism. "The so called democrats have always been threats to the worker's revolution. End the massacre of brave communist patriots! "\n\nAfter admiring his printers' handywork, Zhdanov rolled up the window of his car and asked his chauffeur to drive on. Better stay off the streets in these troubled times."

 NIK.53.d:0 "The population did not know why the violent campaign against the communists had started. Neither did they know why it had ended suddenly.\n\nReports coming in from the democratic party made it clear that the general population's confusion was replaced in the government by dismay. Internal memos trying to assess where the order had come from. Centrist Apparatchik apparently clued in rapidly that the order had come from the top, and a few ill advised conversation over drinks had been dutifully recorded by Suslov's men. Suspicions that Voznesensky had capitulated to the left were corroborated with a few bribes given to key military men of the regime. Making sure of loyalty in tough times? Many governmental paramilitaries would have been incensed to see their prize taken away.\n\nSuslov read the final report before neatly adding it to the pile. The socialist leader was intrigued by the whirlwind of violence and capitulation. He pondered if Zhdanov had made himself useful for once, and stopped the violence against the left. Only time would tell."
 NIK.53.a:0 "Another trap!"
 
 NIK.54.t:0 "Silver Bullet Holes"
 NIK.54.d:0 "A fresh crop of political violence was harvested today in Komi as the headquarters of several radical paramilitaries of all political affiliations began burning down today. The string of fires broke out in a rapid succession, overwhelming Komi's fire department. The buildings had not yet stopped smouldering before manifestations broke out against the arsonists. The protests turned ugly when the crowd could not determined who had really been behind it. In between helping with the fires and quelling riots, quite a few law enforcement officials lost their lives to the chaos. Their funerals will run concurrently with those of a range of paramilitary leaders and soldiers, lost to the blaze and smoke. Ordinary citizens of Syktyvkar have not been spared, for fire and hatred both spread easily in such a large city."

 NIK.55.t:0 "The Smoke and Mirrors"
 NIK.55.d:0 "Pyotr Grigorenko is a man with a plan. In his city, thugs and drifters with no clear ambition join paramilitaries and look for the fight of their life. Why not provide it to them?\n\nIt would, of course, not do for an officer of the democratic government to be seen running around with paramilitary types. This is why Grigorenko does not advertise much his status as head of one of the biggest militias that backs the government. But his slow acquisition of soldiers of fortune and desperados has not been for nothing. Now the time comes to let some steam off Komi's fragile military apparatus.\n\nGrigorenko's men have begun a mass campaign of violence against the far left and far right. Much creative efforts have gone into his little project. Fascist leaders are found killed in the communist's favorite fashion. A stolen truck of the far right is filled with explosives and parked close to a communist meeting. Through all this, governmental soldiers associated with the extremes are found mysteriously dead. As the city descends into chaos, the extremists are likely to assume the useless centrist government is unable to protect them. Why not take action into their own hands, after all? From this initial wave of false flag attack, the good officer hopes to see the radicals throw one another in a mass grave of their own making. After all, it would not be proper for the government to be involved in such untidy violence."
 NIK.55.a:0 "Could it even work?"
 
 NIK.56.t:0 "A Bloodless Victory"
 NIK.56.d:0 "The inferno of political street fighting in Komi has begun to peter out. The far right and far left have run out of angry men with weapons. Dead, wounded or in despair about the loss of so many comrades to violence, members of various paramilitaries have begun pushing on their bosses for a temporary ceasefire. The thug's urge to turn swords into plowshare is probably helped by the complete stalemate. There appears to be no clear winner between the far right and far left, for all radical paramilitaries have been bloodied in the conflict. Temporary gains have inevitably turned into disastrous losses as the cycle of revenge went on. Militia men that had one day been struggling to carry their loot had been found dead in alleyways the next day.\n\nOne side, however, has made it through unsscathed. The government's men, both in the army and off it, have been strangely uninvolved in the conflagration. As a result, few men of the centre have seen their military careers cut violently short. Where once it seemed inevitable to see extremists overwhelm the government, now the centrists hold a fair share of the balance of power."

Her office's peace and quiet was to the rest of the governmental building a microcosm of what Komi should be to the rest of Russia. Could be.\n\nThe light flickered. The woman looked briefly to her small collection of candles. They were useful to keep around; a full day's worth of electricity was a rare treat in modern Russia.\n\nHer office was peaceful and orderly. The militias and paramilitaries made Komi a right mess. But how to get rid of them? Their leader kept the men on a short leash, lean and angry and looking for a scrap. It would probably not be too difficult to push the men over the edge and into open conflict. The small fries were never told why exactly they fought the men they fought; only when to strike. In this situation, perhaps a set of false flag attack might cause the rank and file to pressure their leaders for vengeance and retribution? Keeping angry, violent men on such a short leash was a double edged sword. The promise of violence led to expectations of violence.\n\nIn the shadows of Komi lurked radicals, idiots willing to invite the violence of the Russian Anarchy to Komi. The guardians of orders would need to invite violence in kind. No mercy for the enemies of stability."

 NIK.58.t:0 "Svetlana's Theories"
 NIK.58.d:0 "Voznesensky often wandered the halls of his party's edifice to stretch his legs. Every now and then, the president of the republic saw his steps bring him to the door of one particular staircase. That way lay the path to Stalina's office. A strange location for the rising star of Komi's democratic politics. But the young woman had politely refused to move to a better office. Perhaps she treasured her peace and quiet ?\n\nQuiet, Voznesensky had accepted he would have very little off when he became head of the young republic. Peace, on the other hand, he desperately craved. Each day brought in new problems. Schemes, intrigues, plots, manipulations. It drained him to keep track of the cards in play, and of the players holding them. This was in addition of his role as head of state. Keeping the economy chugging along, managing foreign policy, sifting through reports on the closest Russian warlords. He had very little time to make his own moves. Neither did Kosygin. Busy with keeping the nation afloat, the democrats could do little against the extremist's schemes.\n\nVoznesensky found his hand on the door's handle. A flight of stairs. A corridor. A knock on the young woman's door. Another request. Another confident smile and nod.\n\nSvetlana Stalina's had arrived in Komi with nothing. She had fallen in love at first sight with her new home. The young woman loved Komi's stability, its order, its promise of progress. The radicals she hated with a passion. In them she saw echoes of the failed Soviet Union, of the evil fascist power that had plunged Russia in anarchy. She had joined the democrats in their efforts, and her intelligence, charisma and work ethics had charmed many. Others feared her and her own brand of radicalism. No amount of bloodshed would be too great for Komi. To party members tired of political violence she proposed a wave of terror to end all terrors.\n\nVoznesensky remained at the top of the stairs. He knew not if he wanted to go down."

 NIK.59.d:0 "Voznesensky shrugged off his fatigue. Stalina had been nothing but loyal, trustworthy asset, he though as he went down the stairs. To the spin doctors of the far right and far left, the democrats had struggled to find answer. Now Stalina led the charge at the head of a new generation of democratic politicians. Men and women unable to accept the death of a free and stable Komi without fighting.\n\nHer radicalism and influence were of course points of contention. But as long as they were well monitored, Voznesensky had in the young woman in indispensable ace in the hole. His support for her would of course need to be well calibrated, to avoid upsetting Stalina's detractor within the centrist coalition. But every decision in Komi required careful calibration anyway.\n\nA knock on his underling's door. "Yes, you can enter."The president did so. "Ahh, Nikolai. I wanted to discuss with you."The older politician smiled. "Fancy dinner? We can catch up over some food.""Only if you pay, Comrade President.""

 NIK.60.t:0 "A Victory For Internal Affairs"
 NIK.60.d:0 "The president continued his walk. Useful as she may be, the rising star of the party still had to be reined in. Schemes and plots that went outside the knowledge of the party higher ups was an especially big no-no. Voznesensky was quite certain that his underling's plan was targeted at the extremists, fair and square. But no one knew how far she would go. And Voznesensky had not stayed in the business for so long without learning never to give out blank cheques.\n\nLater, over dinner he wrote out a few memos. The party whip in particular he needed to meet. Stalina would receive an official warning. Heaven knew that it might not be enough to stop her. But it might at least serve as a cold shower on her ambition by signalling to her that the party was watching."

As the violence has spread to several sectors held by the far right, areas of the city held by the far left have seen unusual activity. Many communist militias have moved into the open, aggressively pursuing protection money from new businesses. In effect, the left wing has expanded the size of its operations in formerly neutral or right wing sectors. Several political manifestations supporting the far left have applied increased pressure on the government, profiting from its inability to respond.\n\nSomewhere in the great game of Komi intrigue, Suslov must be smiling contentedly. A great deal of his activities are now going unchallenged, as his opponents are busy with one another."

 NIK.62.t:0 "A Reconstruction Government?"
 NIK.62.d:0 "Secret meetings are part and parcel of political life in Komi. Yet it takes a special set of circumstances for the absolute highest level of security to be deployed. Deep in the chamber of the coalition's headquarters, with only a handpicked few bodyguards as witnesses, the leaders of the three democratic parties as well as Vice-President Rodionov have agreed to a meeting with the democratic coalition's rising star.\n\nIt did not take long for the cat to come out of the bag. Svetlana Stalina directly brought up the subject; Komi's republic is in a bad shape. With extremist faction sharpening their knives, not long remains before the political system is judged obsolete and powerful forces try to unseat it. The best and only option is thus to strike first. By suspending democracy and marshaling all of the state's power, the center can hold off extremism and maintain a reconstruction government until the coast is clear. From this initial statement, the meeting went on..."
 NIK.62.a:0 "Perhaps we can do it... if needed."
 NIK.62.b:0 "This is too far."
 
 NIK.63.t:0 "Considerations"
 NIK.63.d:0 "The three heads of Komi's moderate political parties have had plenty of experience with keeping a good poker face. Even so, Stalina's daring proposal has set in motion many sets of gears inside the four men's head. Outwardly, however, the conversation has seen little more than questions about the details of Stalina's plan. A few token objections have been raised, to test the young woman's ideas. In the end, of a common accord the three party leaders agreed that the proposal had merit, and requested more time to consider the issue. Vice president Rodionov silently approved Voznesensky's proposal. Stalina agreed, satisfied with her progress. The daring proposal might have impressed some of the three men about her growing confidence. Perhaps a reshuffling of the political landscape might be on her horizon?"
 NIK.63.a:0 "Placated, for now."
 
 NIK.64.t:0 "A Meeting on the Side"
 NIK.64.d:0 "Some time after the meeting, the replies started to trickle into Stalina's mailbox. First came the social democrats; Voznesensky and Rodionov seemed the least enthused about the Reconstruction Government of the four. Then came the conservative leader's answer. After many circular reasonings, the man did not reveal much of his thoughts, and thus his opinion remained to be determined. Kosygin's reply was very different. He communicated through intermediaries a request to Stalina for a private meeting.\n\nKeeping a secret from one's own political allies can be as difficult as hiding it from enemies. Yet in a remote spot of the republic, the two politicians managed to meet. The leader of the liberals confided to Stalina his concern about the security situation. If the time came for such a drastic measure, Kosygin would support the young politician's proposal."
 NIK.64.a:0 "Perhaps a new approach is feasible after all."
 
 NIK.65.t:0 "Zhdanovite Connections Revealed!"
 NIK.65.d:0 "Kosygin often found his cabinet had devolved back into a mess of shuffled papers and documents. He was not fond of letting his secretaries clean it, and so once a week he began the task of reordering everything.\n\nIn between a report on the agricultural sector's output in the last few years and a memoranda about the state of highway funding was a strange unmarked letter. The leader of the liberals absentmindedly opened it. His heart skipped a beat; addressed to him by name, the letter described itself as "coming from a friend". Its content preposterously claimed to prove that President Voznesensky was a paid plant for Zhdanov.\n\nKosygin folded the letter back and slid it inside his breast pocket. His secretaries were used to see their boss tear off on some errand without informing them. The politician walked through the building, eventually reaching the quiet section where Stalina's office was.\n\nThe young politician was shocked to see Kosygin break his own rules about meeting one another in public. Her surprise only grew when he passed to her wordlessly an envelope."

 NIK.66.t:0 "Beginning the Investigation"
 NIK.66.d:0 "The origin of the tip off remained a secret. Verifying the proof's truth was thus a difficult proposal. But the seeds of doubt remained in Stalina and Kosygin's mind. Rumors of an improper friendship between Zhdanov and President Voznesensky cropped every now and then in Komi's wild world of political speculations. A few remembered how both men had been associates in the murky past of the WRRF days, despite their later falling out over political differences. The allegation of modern financial and political links was a very serious one that needed proper investigation.\n\nThe investigation would need to be secret, of course. How else would the ties between a communist leader of the opposition and the president of the Republic be ascertained? Both men were too used to Komi's political scene to be sloppy about any relationship. If news came out of this secret investigation, the president would deny everything. Stalina and Kosygin's career would likely never recover. Prudence was the order of the day."

 NIK.67.d:0 "Another meeting in the depth of the ruling coalition's headquarters. Stalina, Rodionov, and Kosygin sat across President Voznesensky's seat. The social democrat politician chuckled something about not expecting to be thrown in front of the inquisition. Silently, Stalina pushed a manilla folder across the table. The President's attempt at levity having failed, he accepted without comment the set of papers and began leafing through them.\n\nA slight frown creased his traits. Worry? Confusion? None of the assembled democratic politicians could decide. All awaited for Voznesensky's response."
 NIK.67.a:0 "Oh?"
 
 NIK.68.t:0 "A Stable Partnership"
 NIK.68.d:0 "The President began by thanking the assembled democrats for trusting him with this delicate matter. The consequences to the coalition's trust might have been incalculable if doubt had been allowed to fester. The horror of seeing trusted colleagues scheming behind his back in a protracted witch hunt could have spelled the end of the President's work in the coalition.\n\nThe proof in question, he went on to explain, was clever for it used confusing places in his finances and assets to create the illusion of an unexplained amount of missing money where corruption could have been present. If the assembled men and women could give him a few hours, all would be explained.\n\nA break was indeed called, and food brought down. Stalina exchanged a glance with Kosygin. The older man did not seem to know where all this was going either.\n\nIn the afternoon, a swathe of financial papers was presented. Kosygin slowly ascertained their accuracy. As it turned, the numbers really meshed. Stalina was the first to get up from her seat and reach over to the president to shake his hand. "Someone has tried to mislead us, and for that I apologize.". The president shook her hand."
 NIK.68.a:0 "Unsafe, certainly. Necessary, possibly."
 
 NIK.69.t:0 "The Conspiracy"
 NIK.69.d:0 "No hunter would just stroll into the open and announce to its prey that the hunt is on. The secret investigation that began as a project by Kosygin and Stalina has been carefully expanded to a trusted few liberal higher-ups. Sub-ministers within Stalina's growing, and accountants helping Kosygin on economic matters, as well as a few intelligence men with ties to both politicians. The goal is to expand the nets of a conspiracy to figure out if Voznesensky has been compromised. By comparing classified information available to a range of different governmental role with whatever intelligence can be found on the communist factions' inner workings. Hopefully a slip up can be used to crack open the case."
 NIK.69.a:0 "You made us do this, Nikolai."
 
 NIK.70.t:0 "Approaching the Left"
 NIK.70.d:0 "Stalina's affinity with the social democratic party had seen her grow ever closer to many of its main players. Yet bringing up the accusation of improper final transactions by the party's leader and President of the Republic took a certain amount of prudence. The young politician requested a private meeting with Vice President Rodionov and a few trustworthy men of the Social Democrat party to share her information.\n\nThe meeting's atmosphere was electric. The men suspected a rare event for Stalina to summon such an illustrious group. The absence of the president spoke volume about the gravity of the situation.\n\nWith everyone gathered, Stalina arranged her papers and began the meeting."
 NIK.70.a:0 "Let's hope they're not compromised."
 
 NIK.71.t:0 "Our Cover Blown!"
 NIK.71.d:0 "Voznesensky knows!\n\nThe president casually brought up rumors of an internal party crisis to Kosygin. Voznesensky expressed dismay at the rumor, and said he had informed Kosygin first to make sure this mystery cabal would not train its attention on the Liberal Party's leader. Kosygin was shaken by the implied threat; it was he could to thank the president and vow assistance in ending this shadowy cabal.\n\nWho could have betrayed them? Suspicion fell on Vice President Rodionov, but Stalina pointed out how the logistics of it didn't make sense.\n\nThe president didn't know the full extent of things, but he certainly knew that eyes were trained on him. The secret investigation was perhaps running out of time."

 NIK.72.t:0 "Burying the Dirt"
 NIK.72.d:0 "The best way forward was to kill the investigation and bury everything. Members of the investigation were cut out of the secret conspiracy one by one, with a combination of threats and promises ensuring they would keep the secret. A few expendable informants were moved out of the city for the time being. Financial information that had served as Kosygin's bedtime reading disappeared up the chimney.\n\nIt was all they could do... But as it turned out, it wasn't enough. The President diligently appraised his ally Kosygin of every bit of progress hunting down the secret conspiracy. The walls were closing in on Kosygin and Stalina."

 NIK.73.d:0 "Both partners in crimes stood in front of the higher ups of the democratic Coalition. Voznesensky spoke most often. He communicated his anger and dismay that the economist and the young politician had gone behind his back and instigated a witch hunt within the party. Had it spread, the damage to party unity might have been incalculable.\n\nBoth would be censured for their activity. As their intention had been to defend the coalition from possible infiltration, both culprits would be allowed to continue their political work. But from now on their work would be heavily monitored by members of the coalition.\n\nIn the panel of party activists censoring them, many former members of the conspiracy. What could they do? Stalina and Kosygin had cut them off to limit the damage. Anyone advocating mercy risked incurring Voznesensky's ire on their head. The two culprits would have to suffer in isolation."

With his plot to tear the liberals apart by stoking paranoia through his agents, the center was already splitting into irrelevant chunks. With every trial and accusation coming out of the formerly ironclad "coalition for democracy", he had another reason to celebrate.\n\nYes, Gumilyov, the esotericist madman, was still credible opposition, no matter how much he hated to say it. But Zhdanov had done his job well, and his attempt to seize power for himself by collaborating with the Voznesentsi had easily been twisted for the more... pure aims of the Revolution.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that Suslov was onto him. He wouldn't be punished... but perhaps a reminder was in order.\n\nYes, in the microcosm of the outside world that was Komi, the seeds of the Revolution had just been planted.

And so Kosygin decided to play the last good card he held in his rapidly shrinking deck.\n\nVoznesensky did not make a good show of looking surprised at Kosygin's request for a private meeting. When meeting the leader of the Liberals, the President of the Republic simply said "Well?"once both were alone. Kosygin sighed. The explanation would be painful. But living through the humiliation was perhaps their only way out. And so, Kosygin began to detail what he and Stalina had been up to."

 NIK.76.t:0 "The Leak Revealed"
 NIK.76.d:0 "The thought could initially be put aside by Kosygin. In the panic to save himself and Stalina from Voznesensky, the leader of the liberals did not have much interest in figuring out how exactly Stalina and him had seen their scheme revealed. After pulling aside the president and coming clean with his secret investigation, the leader of the liberals found himself with a lot of spare time as he waited to hear about his fate.\n\nIn this new abundance of free time, Kosygin's mind raced back to the cause of his trouble. How exactly had the president figured out the investigation team's activities, again? Voznesensky had made an offhand comment about one of his men's finding.\n\nSomething didn't add up, however. There was no way this particular informant could have known the details of the investigation that ended up in Voznesensky's hands. Perhaps then someone had forwarded the information to this man? Certainly not Zhdanov, for leaking his alliance with the President to the democratic coalition would lose him a great trump card. The far right might have known, but Kosygin didn't feel they were behind this. No, this particular man of Voznesensky's inner circle might in fact be a Suslov acquaintance. The other master of the far left would certainly be in a position to weaken his rival and the government all at once.\n\nKosygin called to his secretary. The others in the democratic coalition needed to hear of this theory, no matter what."

 NIK.77.d:0 "Voznesensky was understandably a little bit grouchy at being dragged out to a new meeting by an avowed traitor. Still, his political instincts, his friendship with Kosygin or something else convinced him to make the trip. Stalina was equally present, sitting by Kosygin's side, gazing sternly ahead.\n\nVoznesensky sat in silence as he listened to Kosygin's explanation. It did not take an expert on body language to see how troubled the President was by Kosygin's theory.\n\nKosygin was the first to break the silence. "So, a mysterious information drop reached you and Stalina, accusing the president of being a Zhanovite plant. And then, a new source of information alerted the president that his own party was rebellious." He nodded gravely. "If Suslov was behind the leak to the president, perhaps he was also behind the first leak to you and Stalina. If so, his infiltration of the party would need to be quite complete. Had I or president Voznesensky heard about information falling into your hands, the whole scheme would have broken down."\n\nTo these words, the three men and women fell silent.

But desperate hours called for desperate measures. Once both had reached the secluded meeting spot in the woods outside of Syktyvkar, Zhdanov requested his old friend an end to active hostilities between the government and the communists. Such a ceasefire would let both sides turn their attention to Gumilyov's imminent takeover attempt.\n\nThe president listened to Zhdanov's case without comment.

Vast sections of the democratic and communist districts were left lightly guarded by their owners if their frontiers happened to touch the other side's areas. This level of cooperation, as well as the heightened level of militarization of the front line with the far right demonstrated that at least some coordination had been agreed upon.\n\nGreatest loser in all this were the far right paramilitaries, suddenly pushed back from their over-extended positions.

The only reason for such a deployment was not hard to divine.\n\nThe message was confirmed to be the real deal when policemen aligned with the democratic coalition jammed every radio frequency they could find.

They acquired a few quarters of the capital for their own purposes, and often clashed with democrats or communists. Their big break had been given to them by the government's recent battles with Suslov's forces. Under garrisoned communist or democratic districts had been taken over by the far right. Weapon convoys rolled between various fascist sectors as every area the far right got its hands on was reinforced by fresh militiamen.\n\nIn parallel to the military offensive had come a propaganda offensive. The democrat's pathetic attempt at crushing the decadent far left would come back to haunt Komi, the radio announcer claimed. Had the communist not squandered two opportunities to defeat the Germans already? The democratic coalition was impotent to stop the spread of the communist blight. Only hard men could manage these difficult times. The take over of new areas by fascist militias was only preventive, meant to save citizens from the communist menace.

Worryingly, rumors of mass defections to the communists had also begun spreading. The social democrats were the biggest party of the ruling coalition.

Several representatives that had once been open to compromise with the center and center right had now turned into hardliners. No amount of threats, negotiations or bribes could coerce them back into line. The increasingly suspicious party whips turned to less official channels. The party members' phone lines were tapped, just as paramilitary agents tracked the mutineers every moves. Eventually a pattern began to emerge: almost half of the mutineers were receiving instructions directly from Suslov and his communists!\n\nThis development has turned the mutiny crisis into a looming catastrophe. The communists had planted a hard kernel of dissenters within the social democrats for just such an eventuality. As the social democrat's left wing is riddled with Suslovite agents and those gullible enough to follow them, it is impossible to negotiate with them.

But now the movements of Gumilyov, Suslov and the democratic war hawks required Zhdanov to step up his own game. Thus, his declaration of war as a request for peace.\n\nPresident Voznesensky would receive a humble proposal of peace. Would it not be better if the enemies of reaction united their forces to smash the fascist paramilitaries? The end of the government's assault on the communist paramilitaries would prevent the fascist from gaining strength. It would also safeguard the left's own manpower, for Zhdanov enjoyed knowing the communists held significant firepower. One day, perhaps Suslov's grip would be wrenched away from the paramilitaries, and their ownership would transfer to Zhdanov? This development would have to wait, however. Before that would come the division of the democratic party, as the liberals and conservatives would lash out against the social democrats for letting the communists go free. Voznesensky would be a victim of his attempt to broker peace with the left.\n\nIn this regard, the president might choose to reject peace. It would be a clever move, and the president was a clever man. Voznesensky would never suspect that his old mentor and long time associate would dare burn up their partnership and reveal the president's ties to the left. Such a revelation would of course immensely hurt the president. But Zhdanov suspected he wouldn't even have to go this far. After all, that wily snake Suslov had many trump cards of his own. Better let Suslov engineer a collapse of the government. This way, Zhdanov would keep his very best cards for a few more turns.

The new word from central command was, all available forces were to stop their advances on the reds and whip around to smash the fascist paramilitaries.\n\nBoris began by verifying all of the messenger's credentials. Everything checked out, bizarrely. The orders themselves were written with the usual codes. A phone call to central headquarters confirmed this big switch in priorities.

Zhdanov had long exchanged information and other goodies with his partner as continuous proofs of good will. Now this trade would have to be cut back, to keep the pressure on. The usual methods of communication would also be adjusted, aside from a few emergency channels. Voznesensky would soon see that the old days of continuous access to one another were a thing of the past.\n\nThese few acts of housekeeping done, all Zhdanov could do was wait. He was fairly certain Suslov would come up with a solution to the current fruitless battle between the communists.

Anguish at the thought of his ties with Zhdanov coming to light. Now might be the best moment for Zhdanov to push against the President, to weaken him further before the left could bring a final breakdown of the coalition. By threatening a full reveal of their connection, Zhdanov could try to extract some concession or another, such as a tax free communist district. This would further weaken the President and estrange him from his allies. But the communist politician knew that Voznesensky was a proud man, and was equally likely to resist any further attempt at blackmail. That might prove another worthwhile scenario, for if the president refused further cooperation with Zhdanov he might not live the week politically. Zhdanov surmised that the social democrat's allies would not remain allies for long of a president that had brought their government to the abyss.\n\nThe kettle's whistle brought Zhdanov out of his reverie.

A chorus of indignation lifted up the question, as policemen observed the public protest.\n\nNumbers are still coming in, but it seems that our initial guess that one third of the army has communist leanings has proven accurate. Down to sixty-six percent of its usual strength, and with all of its tank corps joining the strike, our army has been badly hit by this strike."

 NIK.108.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, negotiation between the government and the striking military units have broken down. Police battalions, helped by loyal army troops and a smattering of governmental goons, have managed to beat down the protesting soldiers. Attempts by communist paramilitaries to support the strikers were fought off violently. After a day of bloody battles, the strikers were dishonorably discharged and sent home without pay.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this has hurt the communist in any real way, as the soldiers have simply flooded into their old paramilitary units. The tanks themselves have rolled away from the army bases and into their storage depots near the communist headquarters. No attempt was made to prevent this, the government fearing rampaging tankers turning their guns on Syktyvkar's buildings. Having lost some of its most important regiments, the government is now looking for new source of recruits and materiel."

 NIK.109.t:0 "The Replacements"
 NIK.109.d:0 "The barracks did not remain empty for long. Drill sergeants oversee pushups and rifle drills as government bureaucrats monitor the inclusion of former right wing paramilitaries into the army.\n\nThe far left has inevitably protested the recruitment of "reactionary thugs" into the army, depicting this as "the latest example of the inevitable alliance between spineless capitalist liberals and reactionary fascists." These protests have been drowned out in turn by a tidal wave of outrage from parties ranging from social democrats to the far right. "The communists thugs have deserted their posts in this hour of need" pointed out a fascist deputy, to a mixture of applause and jeers.\n\nThe fascist paramilitaries are known to maintain their own strict standards of training and obedience. The new recruits are generally of excellent quality. Yet many observers worry that by switching the government's reliance on one set of political extremists to another, the republic's safety has not been improved. How long until the new recruits agitate for their own purposes?"

 NIK.110.t:0 "Reports of Gumilyovite Machinations"
 NIK.110.d:0 "For all their criticism of the communist leaving their posts, our new paramilitary recruits are heading toward a strike of their own.\n\nThe recruits demand an increase in pay, and less central oversight from the government. They point out that the old majority communists regiments were permitted to serve under officers with known communist leanings. The government's protest that this has proven out to be an unworkable deal in the long run has fallen on deaf ears. These new soldiers insist they are loyal to the government, and consider their demands for more autonomy as a proof of trust of the government in them.\n\nGovernmental intelligence sources have tried to decipher the far right's communication. Many higher-ups of the democratic coalition suspect Lev Gumilyov, shadow master of the far right to be behind this recent agitation. While his endgame is difficult to deduce, it is clear that Gumilyov is using the government's position of weakness to extract political gains."
 NIK.110.a:0 "Oh, of course."
 
 NIK.111.t:0 "Gumilyov's Men in the Army?"
 NIK.111.d:0 "As quickly as it appeared, the former fascist paramilitaries ended their agitation. All was thought to be good, initially. But spies in the army reported clean new uniforms in the affected units. The former protesters were seen out on the town, racking up magnificent drinking bills. And through all this, the regiment's officers were slowly being shuffled around. An apolitical colonel decided on an early retirement. His replacement was a well known ultra-nationalist. Little by little, the grievances of the former paramilitaries simply went away, solved on their own by the military command's bureaucracy.\n\nDemocratic politicians are now pouring resources into the issue. Has the far right penetrated the military's high command? Or as it simply been a case of Gumilyov spreading bribes to get things to go his way? Either situation are deeply unsettling to the democratic parties. Perhaps the government has traded Suslov's Charibdis for Gumilyov's Scylla."
 NIK.111.a:0 "We're no better off than we started!"
 
 NIK.112.t:0 "Shafarevich's Surge"
 NIK.112.d:0 "Not all of the new recruits were far right radicals. A good quantity of conservative affiliated militias have joined the army. This has been good news for Shafarevich, member of the conservative party on the left of the Passionariyy, and occasional ally of the government. Now that his supporters hold a non trivial position in the republican army, Shafarevich's political star, as tainted as it is by his associated to Gumilyov, has risen sharply.\n\nHis temporary associates in the democratic coalition have not reacted much to this new reality, as the military is, supposedly, a politically neutral organization. However, in Komi a ministerial reshuffle is never far away, and a new conservative ministry might go a long way toward reaching out to the government's new partner.\n\nCommunist politicians, on the other hand, have not been happy to see the rightists gain new supporters. Rumors on the left is that the so-called 'traditional democratic' militias are secretly filled with fascist and Gumilyovites. If true, the conservative soldiers would not be any significant obstacle to a far right take over of the army."

It is an honor to be here."\n\n"Now, Comrade Bukharina, what exactly brought the esteemed daughter of Nikolai Bukharin himself to a place like Komi?"\n\n"Well, for the longest time, all I did was drift with the breeze. I had lost track of everyone I had known in the collapse, even my own father. I had nowhere to go."\n\n"What did you see out there?"\n\n"Horrible things. Desperate people willing to do anything for a bite to eat, Fascist bombers grounding entire communities into dust, not to mention banditry and barbarism of the highest degree."\n\n"Sounds like what we're dealing with now, almost."\n\n"Indeed. I had arrived in Komi just as Operation Suvorov kicked off, and I was there to witness the collapse of the Front. Despite my efforts, the horrors I witnessed back east had managed to follow me here.

Just like the man himself, these still reek of rumors and reports which we must confirm. Turning over the stones upon which these all rest shall be instrumental to the smooth sailing of our own plans.\n\nLet our focus be on the people who act under his thumb.

Voters continued to love her, proving that her landslide victory from when she was first elected was not just a fluke. Ever since Suslov had decided to start promoting her more, the Communist Party continued to grow. Svetlana Bukharina was beginning to become a major political figure in Komi.\n\nHowever, her popularity was not just limited to the citizens of Komi. Her competence, her as daughter of General Secretary Bukharin, and her friendly, polite demeanor all made her popular within the Communist Party itself. She had become most popular amongst the younger politicians and the reformists, but she also lacked any major opponents within the Party. This was good news for the party, and more importantly, good news for Suslov. Svetlana Bukharina appeared to be exactly what the Communist Party needed. Especially with the elections just around the corner."

A brief, loaded silence followed. "Assuming our intel is correct and Gumilyov does, in fact, have no more than twenty or so men guarding his printing presses at night." He paused again. "Not to imply that our boys couldn't handle being outnumbered, especially with surprise on our side. It's just that, you know, there is a limit."\nSuslov sighed. "Has the plan changed at all since you talked to Oplesnin regarding transportation?"\n"Yes, we've procured a truck. The plan is now to break in via the Kuratov Street loading dock. Our armed men will deal with any resistance, and then those two arsonists who were paroled last month with soak the place with gasoline and light it. With any luck, the building will be gutted before the fire brigade can arrive, and we'll be long gone." Varennikov nodded deferentially to his boss. "It's your decision, Comrade General Secretary.""

"Comrade General Secretary, last night's events were the result of an intelligence failure that betrayed our plan to Gumilyov's forces." The paramilitary leader sighed. "Those arsonists, as it turned out, were right-wing sympathizers, and promptly sang like canaries the instant they were brought onboard. As a result, there were thirty men and a Maxim gun waiting behind the door when our people arrived."\n\n"Survivors?"\n\n"None, except for the arsonists. They ran off with Gumilyov's men.

 NIK.118.d:0 "There was always much to do, leading the Communist Party. Everything from spying on enemies, to reviewing plans for the paramilitaries, to even ensuring that the higher ups remained devoted to the cause of socialism. Of course, Suslov's job was not merely to do administrative work, but to support those in the party whomst he saw fit so that the party as a whole could grow.\n\nTo his expectations, Bukharina had made quite a splash in the party. Being the daughter of the old General Secretary tended to do that, after all. Suslov had also expected Bukharina to push her more reformist ideas. However, what he did not expect was just how popular Bukharina's ideas would be. Not only did it appeal to those in the Communist Party, but to a surprising amount of those outside the party as well. She leveraged her influence very well, it seemed. Despite the flagrant revisionism that he suspected to lie within her, such an opportunity could not be wasted, as the party always needed more influence in its struggle against the fascists and the liberals. More resources would have to be moved to the "legitimate" side of electoral politics, which meant more could be invested towards supporting Bukharina's popular movement.\n\nSuslov leaned back in his chair, sipping his tea. Of course, he would keep a careful eye on her and her efforts. It would not do any good for him to overly invest into what could turn out to be a foolish endeavour, and if she proved to be a threat, he could hopefully eliminate her before her ideological deviations grew out of hand."

 NIK.119.d:0 "Svetlana Bukharina had all the qualities of a leader: charismatic, competent, and calculating. However, as it seemed, Mikhail Suslov simply couldn't justify choosing to back her as the Party's future candidate. She was becoming too popular, too influential, and she was becoming a threat to the balance of power within the Communist Party. She was quickly becoming a leading figure of the reformists within the Communist Party, closet-revisionists whose influence Suslov had attempted to limit in the past. Bukharina was ambitious, and Suslov had determined long ago, in the offices of the Front, that such people were not reliable.\n\nPandering to electorialist tendencies, an eternal thorn in the side of Suslov, was not the correct path - regardless of the talents of Bukharina and her associates - or the connections of Zhdanov and his "visionary" social club. To bend to bourgeois democracy to resolve a crisis that had been brought to the party by revolutionary methods was non-viable.\n\nSatisfied, Suslov reached for the dull grey phone on the desk, calling the number he had long memorized. Police would be bribed, newspapers would be stolen, and Radio Pravda would release a new spin on the crisis by nightfall. Whereas it may bring some legal trouble, the environment of the Republic had taught Suslov and his fixers a valuable lesson."

I have never felt so welcomed in a political sense before.\nIt is with great happiness that I announced my candidacy for Deputy in our National Assembly, and it was with great happiness that I accepted my seat both on the Central Committee of the Party and that most illustrious chamber. I am pleased to work besides such noble comrades as yourselves, and under the gentle guiding of General Secretary Suslov.\nIt is thus that I inform you of the other purpose of this letter - I see in my heart of hearts a most prosperous future for us in the socialist Republic yet to come, and I believe that, in the inevitable case of the realization of our ambitions towards the Republic, and the establishment of a new, socialist Cabinet, we could find a most reasonable accord.\n- Svetlana N. Bukharina."\n\nBukharina looked over the letter once more, tapping her silver fountain pen against the desk. It was composed with sufficient subtlety, of course - the sort of composition that would not get her dragged in front of a disciplinary board. However, the unspoken message was still clear - and hinted at her ambitions. A choice faced her, one that she would have to abide by for the foreseeable future - that of its recipient.\n\nTwo obvious candidates ran through her mind - Andropov and Zhdanov - a Suslovite and a reformist - of sorts. Andropov was a stretch and a risk - but a very valuable ally, provided the cooperation that he had carried out earlier held evidence towards his true leanings. Zhdanov was an obvious choice, but he was notoriously erratic and populist - and, in a way, Bukharina simply didn't trust him as much as she could.\n\nWith a moment's contemplation, and a look at the notes on her desk, she began to fill in the address line."

Mikhail Suslov was more familiar than most with this philosophy - he supposed he was like the spider of sorts. He built the web, he maintained the web, and if any outsiders were trapped within the web, he would see them destroyed.\n\nOf late, his carefully maintained and orderly web, however, had tremored on the winds of fate, and he had a growing suspicion that he was not the only spider that claimed it as their own. Andropov, ever the loyal - if enigmatic - agent, had reported to him as he had on all other nights one stormy evening; but when Suslov asked him about Svetlana Bukharina, the hesitation before he spoke, his pre-made file on her, dismissing her as a threat and suggesting Suslov should turn his eyes elsewhere?\n\nThat was alarming.\n\nSomething told Suslov that the man was compromised, likely accepting some bribe or promise of power by Bukharina. The thought of such a betrayal made Suslov's blood curl - this wasn't Bukharin's runt's party - it was Suslov's.\n\nThe worst part was the lack of material evidence. Andropov seemed as loyal as ever, on the surface - the papers arrived on time, and the reports remained meticulous - but something felt wrong, and Suslov was rarely wrong about these things. He expected some sort of a test or a power play soon. He made a vow to himself - if Bukharina attempted to goad him into a trap, if she presented a test... she wouldn't even see his counterstroke coming."

As much as he hated to admit it, it indulged a certain feeling of power to manipulate the two-dimensional surrogates of his colleagues and subordinates as he wove his plans together.\n\nWith all of his contacts, personal relationships, and...other leverage, he could fairly easily determine who would be the next Communist Party candidate for President of the Komi Republic. He skimmed through the assemblage, intermittently striking some figures off the list outright as being too ambitious. Others were, in Suslov's estimation, too powerful in their own right. And then, of course, there were those who had certain ...deviant ideas regarding the party's direction.\n\nIn ordinary times, he would not have resorted to this - but the recent crisis had caused too chaos within the Party to be ignored. The final two photographs lay on his desk in front of him, with meticulously marked notes below each one - a man and a woman, both altogether too-powerful Party members that he could not afford to lose.\n\nChecking the notes, he lifted hs pen once more, and made his final decision.

He had built this organization up from nothing, and everyone who had a position here had it because he allowed it. As he stepped back and watched Bukharina work the crowd, addressing union men and council chairs by name, Suslov knew this had to be nipped in the bud before it grew out of control.

He was, after all, the puppetmaster of the whole Republic. But the red maestro's sickeningly self-assured words gnawed at her.\n\n"Directionally correct."\n\nAs much as she hated to acknowledge it, Zhdanov was not entirely wrong, and, despite her better impulses, his words had gotten to her. The fact remained that, if she was to ever take the helm of the Komi state, Suslov would have to be gone. A man like him could not be brought to heel or compromised with. He had to be broken, and on that level, Zhdanov's words had some value.\n\nThe phone rang a third time.\n\nOf course, Bukharina could not forget the fact that anything coming out of Zhdanov's mouth was almost certain to bare venomous fangs at her sooner or later. Even compared to the two-faced bureaucrats of Komi, Zhdanov had always displayed a truly disturbing level of comfort with falsehood and deceit. In the bizarre political mirror-universe that was the Komi Republic, an offer of an alliance from Zhdanov was perhaps best considered a florid threat.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina, however, was well acquainted with danger. Making up her mind, she picked up the phone as it rang a fourth time."

And, as the actors launched into a rousing chorus with a crescendo of the theater's antique organ, the creaking of steps announced the presence of a visitor for Suslov, the Red Eminence of Komi.\n\nIt certainly wasn't a world-class performance of Boris Godunov that was being put on, Svetlana Bukharina mused as she climbed the rickety stairs to the Komi Grand Theater's lone luxury box parting a thin miasma of bluish cigarette smoke\n\n"To what do I owe the honor, Svetlana Nikolaevna?" Suslov intoned, his voice barely audible over the opera's musical clamor.\n\nBukharina did not respond, letting the tramp of further footsteps on the stairs and a stern look do the talking for her. Six hard-faced paramilitaries filed in behind her as the orchestra below unknowingly sounded a requiem for Komi's puppetmaster.\n\nAnd as his bodyguards shot him a look of sad resignation and holstered their weapons, Suslov knew that this time, he'd been outmaneuvered.\n\n"Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina began curtly, "I think it's time we have a talk." Suslov thought for a moment, running through possible scenarios, and forced a chuckle, regaining a bit of his confidence. He gestured to the militiamen. "I will be honest, Svetlana, I expected better of you."\n\nSvetlana looked right back at him. There was no mercy in those eyes. "As did I. Now, I think we should step out for a moment."\n\n"And for what reason would I do that?"\n\n"Because," hissed a voice from the stairwell. Andrei Zhdanov stepped into the box, flanked by Chelomei and Voytukevich. "I don't think you have a choice."\n\n"My, you people are quite efficient," remarked Suslov, verbally backtracking as he tried to buy time. But age had taken its toll. He had nowhere to run, no backup plan. His bodyguards had been paid off. He fumbled at his pants, trying to draw the pistol he barely knew how to use, but the advancing militiamen were faster, tackling him to the ground and sending his gun clattering across the floor.\n\nSvetlana let a slight smile cross her face. There was something deeply cathartic about seeing the spider become tangled in his own web."

Suslov grunted as his hands were pulled behind his back by one of the paramilitaries.\n\n"No. It's yours," replied Bukharina. "They can't tell the difference."\n\n"You're a fool, Bukharina. Putting a bullet in my skull only means Zhdanov will put one in yours," Suslov said, a snarl creeping its way into his voice.\n\n"That's none of your concern, Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina shot back, pulling a silk dress glove out of her pocket and slipping it on her right hand.\n\nAt the same time, the militiamen pulled the handcuffed Suslov upright. Despite the blood running from his nose and the newly-acquired grime on his suit, Svetlana had to admit that Suslov still cut a striking figure as he examined his captor with disdain.\n\n"So what exactly shall I be forced to agree to?" Suslov sneered. "Surrendering my position? Declaring you Tsarina?"\n\n"Don't you even start with that," Bukharina scolded. "You've known me for long enough to know exactly what I want you to know."\n\n"A naked power grab, then. I shouldn't have expected much from the product of Nikolai's affair with his own secretary," Suslov hissed.\n\nBukharina bent over and slid her prisoner's gun into her gloved hand, screwing on a suppressor. Suslov's eyes widened with fear as she raised it, racking the slide. Pandemonium erupted in the box as Suslov writhed at his handcuffs, shouting breathlessly while Bukharina's men grabbed Zhdanov, and pulled him back towards the railing. The lead soloist launched into an aria, the orchestral accompaniment resounding throughout the hall. Chelomei shouted something, holding his boss back, both helplessly adrift in the ruins of their own plan.\n\nWithout so much as a word, Svetlana glanced over her shoulder at Zhdanov and put a bullet in her co-conspirator's head."

A van that, Suslov noticed with no lack of bitter amusement, was registered on his own orders. The pen in his hand twitched as he read through the list again, a cold feeling churning in his gut.\n\nLimitations on the power of General Secretary, an election for the position within three years, a freeze on party purges, an end to interference in local soviets' affairs. All unthinkable on their own - but combined, they formed a crushing, black wall that he could barely tolerate to look at.\n\nHe looked up at his former allies, who sat on the opposite side of the van. Bukharina's stare seemed to penetrate through him as if he wasn't there. He tried to send a glare back, but he couldn't muster it. There was something within him that he had not felt in a long time - resigned defeat. He opened his mouth to speak, the words as ash in his mouth. He knew that he sounded hurt. He couldn't help it.\n\n"I am... surprised that you allowed me to keep my membership within the Party, despite your commitment to stripping me of every ability that I have to keep this organization coherent," he managed. "Do you wish for a puppet, then? A reminder of your triumph?" He practically spat out the words, as he signed the paper.\n\nBukharina's gaze met his, utterly unsympathetic, as she spoke a single sentence. "Directionally correct, Comrade General Secretary."\n\nThe echo of his own words rang in his ears for as long as it took for him to hand over the paper, exit the van, and retire to his dacha, empty and alone."

The red-feathered inhabitant was nowhere to be seen, and the door was askew, as she usually kept it - which she figured was good. She didn't want to be seen like this - not even by her pet.\n\nThe vision flickered through her mind again, and again, and again. An impulsive shot - the red mist exiting her old coworker's head, the light vanishing from his eyes in an instant. The sound of his dropping, Suslov staring at her impassively, the mad dash to the van through hidden corridors as sirens rang out in the distance. It repeated like the wail of the air-raid sirens that rang out whenever a German bomber decided to take a risk and go for the city's suburbs.\n\nShe looked down at the black blazer that she was wearing, accentuated by a crimson scarf. Blood-red - the same color that had escaped into the air after she pulled the trigger. The color of the people's flag. As she lay there on her back, staring at the crack in the ceiling that she wasn't home enough to patch, she tried to collect her thoughts. Regroup, refocus, repress the memory. Think of something else, anything else.\n\nHer stream of conscience was interrupted by a slight weight on her chest, and the feeling of tiny claws. The red-feathered, black-beaked countenance of her bird, perched atop the breast pocket of her blazer, looked right into her eyes, his head cocked to the side. She remembered feeding him a worm, and the quick snap of his beak. She smiled sadly, and spoke aloud for the first time since she had shot Andrei."

Of course, nothing prevents the Passionariyy militants to rely on their own forces, finding their own ways to trick the subpassionarian mobs, but an easier option appears to be aligning with the monarchist fighters of Sergey Taboritsky. They are a violent, cold-hearted folk who fanatically believe in their chieftain Taboritsky and his preachings about the second coming of the Tsar, and the rumors about the low character of Sergey Vladimirovich are familiar to every soul in the city. Taboritsky is an untrustworthy type, but perhaps those fancy weapons the Tsar's boys stole from the secret Soviet stockpiles could teach a lesson to our enemies, scaring them away before the fight even starts?"

I hope that we both, despite our differences, are able to set these aside and come together as friends. I say this with interest in the success of your endeavors as well as my own.\n\n"If it does not give you too much reason to object, I hope that you may consider my request for the assistance of some of your men. Additional hands would be beneficial. And in return, I extend my own men and their services to you. A fair exchange, I hope, but this is up to you. For I only anticipate that we look out for our own interests. I will not put too much weight in expectations, but if you do approve of my request, then you may have good reason to place some faith in me. I pray you have a good day."\n\n"Sincerely, L. Gumilyov" At the end of it, Taboritsky gave it thought. He did not have close ties with Gumilyov and his supporters, but if this man was reaching out to him with this letter, there is opportunity to consider. Although there were real differences of opinion and purpose, he didn't want to waste any assistance extended to his own cause. If successful, the coming tsarevich would be delighted at the results. But if Gumilyov betrayed him, then not only would there be displeasure but retribution from God himself for his treachery.\n\nHe thought over his options carefully, then he offered it up in prayer, and waited for a sign."

What is the nature of Russia?" Hearing not a single answer from the audience, and perhaps expecting it, Gumilyov would continue. "Russia's nature is one not of Bolshevik or Tsar, but one of a diverse collection of pieces that fit together into a larger puzzle. What the Tsar couldn't do, and what the Bolsheviks refused to do is transform Russia into something greater than what it was and has ever been."\n\nAfter taking a moment to gauge how positive the audience reaction had been, he continued, "The future of Russia lay not with the red demagogues or tsarist nobility, but with unity between all Russians, including those who have been wrongfully denied their place as proper Russians, the Turks, the Tatars and Mongols." One of his aides would signal that it was time to end his speech, which he would reluctantly oblige.\n\n"God bless you all, I'm sure we will all meet again very soon." Stepping off the stage, Gumilyov felt the effects of his speech immediately, with the crowd descending into a flurry of cheers and claps.

Why don't we hear them?"\n\nVoznesensky's voice was heard, slightly corrupted: "... the Komi, the damn Komi! Do you have any idea how much this messes up our plans? We can't (corrupted), and that is all because of the damn natives. They're communists, I tell you, traitors to the country, all of them! One day we'll deal with the problem they are for our Republic!"\n\n"And that's what I call a damn interesting recording!

The numbers we were hoping for were not achieved, and small hurdles in our way reduced the effectiveness, with many natives either not convinced due to the President's past, or simply indifferent to the new policy.

The neighborhood has been flooded with the colorful patterns of the natives, and some artists have even helped create a fusion of these traditional designs with modern ideas for artistic masterpieces. The Museum of Komi Culture also cooperated, and has welcomed many visitors this week.\n\nIn general, the Festival seems to have been a massive success for the organizers.

The author has in fact lived through almost this entire era, and as such had a first-hand experience that helped him write the book.\n\nCritics have acclaimed the book, which combines elements of historical literature with Smirnov's own experiences throughout his life in a way appealing to all readers. The History of the Republic has skyrocketed in popularity days within its release among both ethnic Rusians and natives. The Komi themselves also appear to be satisfied with the image presented, and point to the modern problems mentioned as well as the need for equality and respect from their co-patriots.\n\nThe question is, aside from the clear cultural impact and legacy such a popular book will leave in the Republic, if there will possibly be any political implications. Smirnov himself has clearly stated he is not affiliated with any of the myriads of political organizations operating in the nation, and is independent. Of course, not all believe that, but for the most part, "A History of Our Republic" appears to be nothing more than an insight into the history of the natives that play such an important role in this nation."

I will not bore the esteemed member of the ruling coalition with my life story once more, if only to underline again how this free republic took me in in these difficult times for Russia. This gift of freedom and peace, of a place where we can help one another to rebuild our fractured nation, this gift of democracy enduring and untarnished, this gift is one I ardently wish to protect. As this assembly proceeds with the election of a candidate for the presidential elections, I stress to all gathered today: debate the merits of each presidential hopeful. But once a candidate for our coalition is chosen, I implore you to follow them without hesitation. The unity of our coalition is one of our strongest weapons against the radicals that seek to bring our republic to an early end. The dogs of the communist party, the animals found in Komi's far right fringes.. They care not one whit for our institutions.

After the customary round of thanks to the assembly, and the congratulations given to Voznesensky and Stalina for their efforts in the coalition, Kosygin reached the heart of his speech.\n\n"The Germans have squandered the wealth of their nation in fuel and bombs for a terror bombing campaign that has accomplished very little. Now, the frequency of bombings dwindles by the day. Rumors coming from Moskowien detail the upcoming collapse of the Reich. My friends, once the German planes are gone we shall be free to rebuild. We've kept hope all these years. Our childrens were taught as best as possible. Our homes were cleaned of debris where possible. Now that the terror bombing campaign is ending, the reconstruction of Russia can begin. New factories, new schools, new courthouses, new churches. The republic's citizens are strong and hardworking. A new republic is within reach." Kosygin paused. "It is my belief that this republic can re-unite Russia. Chosen as candidate for our esteemed coalition, and elected president of the Republic, I vow to dedicate all my energy to a new Russian nation able to house generations upon generations. Our cause is just, and it shall take us to the Pacific sea in the east... And to Moscow and St. Petersburg in the west. Thank you.""

His energetic and driven way of approaching any topic had helped him lead his nation throughout a range of issues, and his particular way of speaking had its usual effect on the assembly of making everyone in the audience captivated.\n\n"Honorable members of the assembly, thank you for your presence. Thank you a million times for your support, for it was by your help that I could become president, and it was through your continued support that our coalition government has safeguarded Komi's citizens these past few years. I call once again upon your support for my nomination as presidential candidate. The republic stands at a crossroad, as shadowy figures emerge to the forefront of Komi's politics. Several sets of long planned intrigues are reaching their conclusion , and their impact on the Republic promises to be an unmitigated disaster. I request a new mandate to continue the struggle against the snakes that wish to usurp our institutions. Stalina was right in denouncing the group of rabble rousers that spread their poison into the veins of our parliamentary system. The time to strike is almost upon us; in a new mandate I would bring down the might of the legal system upon those who scheme the nation's destruction. Our institutions can, and must, be reinforced so that no matter the amount of muck thrown by our opponents into its working, our republic will live on to bring our people to a bright future.""

More specifically, Ponomaryov considered the options he had in his search to stabilize his rule. With the recent consolidation of power within the Party, he could only find two possible paths. He could align with Bukharina's reformist base in the labor unions and student movements - or, he could, of course, stay far from the reformists and trust in Suslov to give him what he needed.

However, some members of the former President's faction had still not left the capital, perhaps because they were willing to cooperate. And Zhdanov would capitalize on that opportunity.\n\nThe Center's left wing would be approached with an intriguing chance to remain in power, and that was to peacefully collaborate. Seeing as the new leader of the county had already made an extensive effort to support Voznesensky and his people to get into power, it wasn't that hard to believed that he would use the social democrats to consolidate his rule, which was by no means perfectly stable - even though this was a common occurrence for the governments of Komi.\n\nWhat Zhdanov and his allies understood, though, was that there was perhaps an even better way to solidify their control over the violent political stage, and that was by backstabbing. Having gained the trust of the Voznesentsi, it would be more than simple to make the planned meeting, in which talks with them over a national unity government would be held, a trap.

The building they were in, what used to be the National Assembly of the Republic until it was forcefully dissolved, seemed massive in comparison with the few delegates that had arrived from the two factions to discuss.\n\nIn theory, this was a National Assembly meeting to "hold talks on the formation of a national unity government in face of the crisis the Republic was facing". In practice, it was nothing more than a meeting between a few representatives, as everyone else not part of the non-Suslov Socialists or the Social Democrats was obviously absent. Soon, though, even this meeting which seemed to show potential would devolve into chaos. Government troops stormed the building, trying to arrest all the supporters of Voznesensky. They replied in kind, using both firearms they carried with them and bringing in support from a nearby paramilitary unit.\n\nThe battle was fierce, but in the end, the small number of government troops seemed unable to cope with the unexpected arrival of reinforcements. Under cover from gunfire, the social democrats fled the building, racing to get out of the city before being caught. And it seems they have succeeded, as they disappeared, before the army reported that this group of a few dozen politicians had actually gotten across the border with the Vologda Neutral Zone, entering the neighboring warlord state.\n\nOf course, being neutral and with some democratic aspirations, Vologda has refused to hand over the "political refugees". We have given up on trying to get them under our custody again, as it now appears out of reach. All in all, this mission seems to have been a failure, and the only thing we can do now is cover up the affair from the public."

 NIK.214.t:0 "A Strike Against Fascism"
 NIK.214.d:0 "Yuri Andropov appeared in the headquarters of the Komi Republic Special Forces, far from the busy streets of Syktyvkar, and hidden in plain sight in the countryside. The building did not draw one's attention, cleverly disguised as a normal government building or offices.\n\nThe close associate of Andrei Zhdanov presented himself to the commander of the Squad, who bowed in respect, and quite clearly understood that this was an important case. After completing the typical proceedings and bureaucracy, Andropov was introduced to the group of thirty men handpicked by the regime to lead Plan Blue - the special operation to take the Eurasianists out of the picture. Then, he began to outline the plan to his subordinates.\n\n"I am here on behalf of General Secretary Zhdanov together with my trusted commanders to assign you a mission crucial to this Republic's future - to strike at Lev Gumilyov. On the behalf of the General Secretary, it is my duty to convey the details of this operation, codenamed Plan Wolf."\n\n"Using confirmed reports and eyewitnesses, we have located the hiding spot for the leader of the reactionaries, who is in Slobodskoy and under protection by a local paramilitary unit. This has allowed us to design a plan that, should it be carefully executed, will allow us to capture Gumilyov and perhaps many of his remaining allies, ending the threat they present. It is of crucial importance to maintain the element of surprise and find the perfect moment to strike when their guard is down. Remember, this is no simple operation - it has been assigned to you because you are considered the most capable force available. Preparations will begin shortly.""

One of the most effective ways to gather more troops is to flood the national airwaves with our militarist propaganda in order to invoke loyalty in our subjects. Though much of our messages to the public are loud and threatening, it is necessary to instill courage and toughness into anyone willing to take up a rifle.\n\nUnfortunately, the broadcast of such propaganda may also deter citizens from their faith in the Communist system.

 NIK.229.d:0 "Zhdanov mulled over the file from his desk. Apparently, the liberals planned to seize several files from the Party, although their plans have been discovered. Zhdanov wondered what he should do with this information. It would be trivial to plant some false information, and have them turn on each other. Especially if several of their leaders and politicians were to suddenly be revealed to have fascist sympathies, or were selling paramilitary supplies to the highest bidder behind their backs.\n\nBut was seeding the files worth the effort? If their interference were discovered, it could further unite the liberals, and cause some unnecessary hassle down the road. Planting the files seems low-risk, but you can never be too cautious."

None of the incriminated leaders were arrested, and the Republic seems to not suspect any collusion within its ranks. An informant discovered the planted files in the trash, which means the plan has failed.\n\nZhdanov's interference was discovered, but how? Was the information contradictory? Were the files out of character for those incriminated within them? Was there a leak from one of their own? Figuring out why this went wrong could prove crucial for the success of future plans. At least the liberals don't seem to be particularly bothered by it, which means that Zhdanov can investigate this small failure free from any distractions that could get in his way."

 NIK.231.d:0 "Days passed, and, predictably, the files were seized. A few short days later, and several prominent liberal leaders were disappeared without Zhdanov's involvement. Judging from which leaders were disappeared, and the timeframe of the disappearances, it appears that the liberals took the bait. They fell for the false intel, and the operation was a major success. Zhdanov smiled to himself as he read the reports, a few rushed documents and an underpaid party official had allowed them to deal a nice blow to the liberals of Komi. Considering the success of the plan, Zhdanov thought that such tactics should be used more often, although the trick may not work as well a second time. None of that mattered right now, for today was a good day for Zhdanov."

These party members may prove to be quite dangerous later on, obstructions to Komi's (and Zhdanov's) success. They may rat him out for being too much of an idealist, with no realism to back his cause.\n\nWhat hangs in the balance is the decision: should he eliminate these "allies" now, nipping the problem in the bud, or should he let them live and keep his support within the party?"

The dossier on his desk covers an expected topic, blanketed on the cover like an obscene joke - RADICALISM IN KOMI. He flicks through the pages, his frown intensifying at the red names and cancellations on some of the pages - evidently taken from the Democratic Coalition's own census rolls.\n\nThere are quite a lot of cancellations.\n\nVoznesensky has the smile drip off his face, and he faces the assemblymen with little more than a ghost of a facial tic. He has at least the courage to be honest, even if what he is saying will make their jobs far harder than before.\n\n"Morozov spoke to me this evening, after the end of debate. He says some of his men have lost confidence in the Coalition. They're writing the letters as we speak, and after tomorrow we will lose about 30 men. These men are - were - our majority in the Parliament. We will move to formalize relations with the Communists and the Passionariyy Party in tomorrow's session."\n\n"There are still options. We are, after all, the incumbent - and our policies, while leaning on majority rule, are not entirely dependent on it. And after that-"\n\nHe stops, but the meaning in his silence is clear. It is unthinkable, the democrats of Komi plotting the arrests of their opposition. And yet - perhaps it is the necessary option.\n\nKosygin rides the tide of opinion. He clears his throat."

 NIK.234.d:0 ""I speak to you from the Chamber in which all of our careers were made, and as I begin, I urge all of you to remember your first speeches here. All of us were once novices in politics, thrust into the Assembly by fate and desperate need. This was an unexpected Republic, and we were unexpected Republicans."\n\nStalina pauses, surveys the crowd. Old instincts kick in - her left flank's a little cold. Time to amp it up a little.\n\n"And who among us does not remember the old years? The arguments we used to have, before Vosenevsky brought us into Coalition and Opposition, about how this Republic would be. Who would stay in Parliament when a thousand dreams clashed at once? How would we solve the problems of the citizen when our castles in the sky waited to be built?"\n\nA little laughter, rueful almost. It's working. Stalina turns back to the main topic. Easy does it - like riding a horse.\n\n"My point is this: it was not because of the beauty of our dreams that we have kept our Republic, as the Union fractured and the old world died around us. It was not ideals that kept us fed, or clothed, or safe. Many assemblymen deny it even now - but it was the common belief we are sworn to uphold, the dream of a Congress for and of all, working not towards paradise, but upwards from the present."\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed.""

The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly-"\n\nShe barely hears the dull thud of the shot before a guard slams into her bulk, throwing her into the stage as the audience erupts into chaos. The gunshots continue, at irregular intervals, until they are silenced, and from the east of the auditorium muffled cries and the sound of fistfights echo.\n\nThen another burst of fire, this one rapid and shallower, from the top of the tripartite stage above her. Screams, and the distinct thud of flesh hitting lead. Stalina's world tunnels in on itself, to the narrow web of cover that leads to the exit. Grunting slowly from the bruise in her side, she moves forward, ever forward, at what feels like the pace of a snail.\n\nAs the auditorium roars with gunfire behind her, Stalina keeps her face set, only allowing herself the pleasure of a single thought."

It's about as much as she can ask for these days, and it's not a bad life, all things considered.\n\nAt least this Stalina fellow who's yammering on the radio is a good orator. She tunes the rusty dial up a little, strains her ears:\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\nShe nods unconsciously. She remembers the old Union, one where the flutter of the flags belied the dark hollows of its rule. Nowadays the only government functionaries who stop by are the ones who do census-taking, which is a breath of fresh air, really. Things have changed, and mostly for the better, haven't they?\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nVolkova finds herself clapping, for some strange reason, as the speech concludes in a roar of applause - and her thoughts stray to the old passport she still keeps in her closet, signed by Voznesensky himself in the old days.\n\nPerhaps she'll think about voting again, the next time elections come around - and she knows where the future, and her confidence, truly lies. "
 NIK.236.a:0 "A small victory for democracy."

 NIK.237.t:0 "A Bitter Silence"
 NIK.237.d:0 "Petro Grigorenko watches as the crowds gather around the Vosnesentsi-sponsored speaker. Factory workers and middle-managers, dressed in the slim-fit waistcoats and suited shirts that pass for Komi haute couture fashion - they seem like the kind of people to gravitate to his friend. In any case, Stalina asked for help in surveying popular reaction, and Grigorenko has never been one to refuse a friend.\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do.

We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nThere is emptiness on both ends of the radio this time. The crowd continues to whisper, but there is no hint of celebration, agreement or even vague positivity. It is as if the speech had been given over a dead mike - the crowd certainly doesn't seem to have heard anything.\n\nAs the audience disperses, Grigorenko winces and prepares to leave. Svetlana really isn't going to like what he has to say at the next meeting. Perhaps a little alcohol will help the message go smoother."

With this in mind, there are two prevailing ideas we can attempt that would see this situation flip. The first is simply to cede the majority of the territory, which we'll never be able to patrol completely, in order to build up defenses and fortifications in crucial government buildings and factories. From there, we can begin sending out combat groups to put down any potential rebellions.\n\nThe second plan is more offensive, the idea is to send out pacification teams to quash rebel activity in the more rebellious neighborhoods BEFORE any dissent can form.\n\nWhatever we choose, we must do so quickly."

In order to learn these details, we must raid the headquarters of the Communist Party and Shafarevich's Passionariyy. Those locations are public knowledge, and informants within these buildings can help us find useful intel.\n\nWhile conducting these raids, we have two options for our strategy. The first strategy is to grab only what information our spies can verify, so that we avoid any contingency plans and false intel the enemy may have planted. This is the less risky option, but it also requires more time, and will result in less information being gathered. The other strategy is to grab as many files as we can, sort out the contents, and act upon whatever useful information we happen to come across. This will result in more information being gathered, but is obviously riskier. If we come across false intel, our forces could end up stumbling into a trap. The question is, which strategy do we employ?"

If we don't act upon this information right away, the enemy will be fully-equipped for a coup. We need to seize these weapons and commanders immediately, anything else is a dangerous waste of time. Luckily, it seems the radicals weren't expecting a raid upon their headquarters, so we should have enough time to strike before they can act."

If we could seize these weapons and commanders, we could cripple the radicals and ensure the safety of our government. We need to act quickly, however, since it will only be a matter of time before the enemy realize we've received this intel. If we wait too long, all of this information will be useless and we'll have simply wasted our time.

It was past midnight, and Sergei had spent the last several hours reading mind-numbing documents with a barely functional flashlight. Occasionally they had to drop everything and hide when a car approached the building, but none of the cars ever stopped in front of the building.\n\nFinancial reports, predictions for upcoming party primaries, complaints about cuts to the catering budget, and meeting transcripts about said catering budget complaints. Polls on how voters reacted to different buzzwords, pages and pages of ideological debates, and disappointing salaries filled up each and every filing cabinet in this God-forsaken building. How could someone fill up so many folders with so much irrelevant nonsense? How was it also so disorganized? Sergei swore there was no rhyme nor reason put into what document went where, and Sergei now understood why people complained so much about rising paper prices in Syktyvkar. This was just an unnecessary amount of documents.\n\nThey had been in the building too long, they had to move on. Sergei stuffed several folders of financial reports, and various other documents that seemed especially useless, and just hoped the radicals happened to have the most amazing encryption code in Russia. Maybe some government bureaucrat can find something of value in this pile of trash."

The operation would be a multi-pronged attack, with squads being deployed across Syktyvkar and the surrounding countryside. Some locations had to be ignored, due to manpower and resource constraints, but the majority could be struck in a reasonable amount of time. If this operation failed... then Komi's republic would likely not last much longer. It was now or never."

If the intel was correct, then it should have been a decisive blow against the radicals, and a great victory for the Republic. Such a victory could have secured the government's position and ensured democracy's survival.\n\nExcept the intel was wrong.\n\nThe radicals had been expecting the Republican forces to conduct a raid on their files, and had planted false intel. Those locations that were correct and not simply decoys had been fortified and staffed with paramilitaries. When the Republican forces reached these locations, the paramilitaries opened fire upon them.\n\nHeavy losses were sustained, and the Republican forces were sent into disarray. Meanwhile, the cells not present in the false intel or that were simply ignored mobilized. Now radical cells were rising up across Komi.\n\nThe Republic has failed."

If the intel was correct, a heavy blow should be dealt to the radicals, and the government's position would be made more secure.\n\nThe operation was a great success. Using the invaluable intel gathered from the radicals, the Republican forces were able to strike at the perfect moment, catching the radicals off-guard. The radicals' paramilitaries were in the midst of mobilizing as Republican forces opened fire, preventing them from properly arming or establishing a credible force. We've also arrested or killed some of the more experienced paramilitary commanders, crippling their forces' ability to organize. It seems the radicals had been expecting an attack, but our forces must have prepared faster than they had predicted, considering how unprepared the enemy was. Even if we didn't truly possess the element of surprise, we still dealt a huge blow to the radicals' ability to strike against the government. The radicals should be unable to carry out an effective coup. We can breathe a little easier now that our democracy has been secured for now."
 NIK.250.a:0 "Democracy stands strong!"

 NIK.251.t:0 "Their Forces Diverted!"
 NIK.251.d:0 "While we have seen great success with our raids, and the enemy forces seem to have been devastated. However, we have surely not secured every arms cache in Komi, and given time the radicals will surely be able to muster enough forces to carry out a coup. At the very least, our raids mean they can't rise up immediately, and we have likely significantly delayed their plans.\n\nThe time we've bought with these raids is precious. We must use them to further secure our position, further prepare ourselves for possible coup attempts, and further consolidate our rule by other means. While these raids are successful, raids alone can't save our republic. The radicals will also learn from this raid, and will likely better secure their intel and weapon stockpiles. They have been wounded, but their wounds are certainly not fatal. We need to invest in propaganda, we need to introduce reforms, and we need to win over the Komi's citizens. If we can get the civilians to feel safe and support us, the radicals will lack enough support to strike against our government. That is how democracy survives."

In the face of democratic failures, their support has grown and radicalized. A sizable amount of the leftist fringe has been violent in the past, but the audacity of these new attacks on Komi's elite and government is unprecedented. As they might say, we are rapidly approaching a "revolutionary situation".\n\nWhile their challenges to our authority are disturbing, the communists have not made overt threats to the Presidium as of yet. Vigilance is necessary, but we must be careful not to overstep our bounds, lest we give the left an excuse to escalate tensions to the breaking point."

 NIK.254.d:0 "Residents of central Syktykvar were rudely awakened last night by the sounds of yelling and breaking glass, as members of a left-wing paramilitary waged an all-out attack on a local police station. According to witness reports, the incident occurred shortly after midnight. Somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five masked youths armed with bricks and batons stormed the station, breaking windows and assaulting the outnumbered officers. Two officers were hospitalized, but the attackers ignored non-police personnel. Owing to the time, the station was significantly understaffed; investigators believe the operation was meticulously planned to maximize chances of success.\n\nThe instigators successfully fled the scene, but two were recognized by neighbors and subsequently brought into custody. The police have identified them as Anatoly S. and Bogdan P., members of the Workers' Street Battalions, a local ultra-left paramilitary loosely connected to the Communist Party. Both have refused to assist officers with the investigation. Judging by the coordinated nature of the operation and its members' discipline, the possibility exists that this attack was ordered by Party higher-ups as a show of force, rather than being an impulsive move by radical "lone wolves"."

Cars tend to be reserved for businessmen and politicians, people who value privacy, speed, and security in their travels and have the money or connections to get the best possible transport. This makes road travel prestigious -as well as a target for those who seek to destabilize the Republic.\n\nThree days ago, a simultaneous detonation of several explosive devices on roads and bridges in central Syktyvkar paralyzed the city for several hours, as first responders were unable to reach the scene. Despite the devastation caused by these bombings, the perpetrators appear to have attempted to minimize casualties; the explosions occurred in the middle of the night, and the primary targets were the roads surrounding the Presidium building and several prominent local businesses. However, they still claimed two lives, and five other people have been hospitalized. The bombers are currently unidentified and remain at large, but the targeting of local elites suggests that they belonged to radical leftist movements.\n\nThis is a sobering day for the Republic. The bombings took Syktyvkar's already beleagured police force completely by surprise. Justice becomes less likely with each passing hour, while the militant Communists become ever more organized."

Bloody noses and broken bones are a common sight after weekend street rights between the competing paramilitaries of the far left and far right. These clashes are rarely lethal, which makes the recent murder of several paramilitary commanders all the more shocking.\n\nUsing military-grade weaponry, a leftist radical has assassinated three lieutenants of a street fighting group associated with our government's forces. The boldness of this assault is unprecedented; the victims were ambushed outside of a local restaurant, where they had been having lunch, scarcely past noon. The attacker threw a grenade at the establishment before gunning the men down with a machine pistol. He was himself killed in a shootout with their bodyguards shortly afterwards. Officers were able to find his identity, that of one Vasily K., and determine his political affiliations through his possessions, which included The Communist Manifesto, but he has no clear connections to the Communist Party or local leftist groups. This suggests either that he was a lone wolf or that he was very good at covering his tracks.\n\nReports are already coming in of escalating tensions between active militias, as both sides prepare for the possibility of revenge killings and a spiral of violence.

Komi's communists have been vocal in their displeasure at Christianity, especially as churches became bolder in their activity with the withdrawal of the WRRF from Syktyvkar. In past days, this mostly took the form of angry rallies outside religious institutions, but normality seems to have ascended to a higher plane since the beginning of our political turmoil.\n\nA church associated with Syktyvkar's conservative monarchists has recently been burned to the ground in what appears to be the most flagrant arson attack in several years. Fortunately, it was empty, the blaze having struck roughly two hours after the end of Sunday services. Officers were initially unable to find a perpetrator or motive, until the presumed arsonist mailed a letter to the police station filled with anti-religious invective and sections from The Communist Manifesto. Rumors about the arsonist and their potential future targets have spread like wildfire throughout Syktyvkar's religious community, and several prominent churches have employed police or militia guards.\n\nEven in Komi's perpetually agitated political climates, churches have largely remained safe from direct assault. The fact that previously untouchable targets have fallen under attack is a testament to the undeniable decline of political order and state power. The only thing that can be done now is pray that the situation won't degrade to an even greater degree."

The Presidium would simply be too risky of a target, and, no matter how swamped with cases, the police force would be tireless in pursuing any would-be assailant. It is clear now that they were tragically mistaken.\n\nThe clock was scarcely past ten last morning when the sound of mortar shells hitting the Presidium building badly rattled Syktyvkar's residents. Communist militiamen posted on a nearby building had timed the attack precisely to when as many moderate and conservative politicians as possible were inside the building. Thankfully, there were no deaths; security was well prepared and the evacuation went smoothly. The vast majority of the Communist Party was curiously absent at the time, although its leadership has completely denied knowledge of the events and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation. Many in the police are skeptical, but the crisis-level criminal situation has made them completely unable to coordinate a serious inquiry. Communist presence in many of Komi's neighborhoods has reached the point where they can credibly challenge the police, and few are eager to see what would happen if they clashed openly.\n\nThis attack has completely shattered the illusion that Komi's politicians are insulated from the upswing in political violence. The only question now is whether the politics of the street will inevitably overpower the politics of the state, or if Komi's government still has a leg to stand upon."

As they are finding out all too late, Komi's establishment have seriously underestimated the threat the right poses to the government.\n\nRadical right-wing Passionarists shelled the Presidium and its immediate surroundings with mortar rounds during a press conference, killing several journalists. By sheer chance, the blasts failed to kill any politicians, although two Communist Party legislators received light injuries. Right wing parties were not present at the events. Lev Gumilyov informed reporters that the Passionarists were having a meeting at the time, although he failed to elaborate on the reason for convening or the topics covered. Several Passionarist politicians, declining to provide evidence, allege that the attack was a false flag by police or radical leftists and completely deny complicity.\n\nWhile the journalists' families are left to mourn their dead, the government must confront the fact that it is under full assault from not one but two extremist factions. Syktyvkar's experts have little faith that the government, already struggling to contain the communists, can quickly devote adequate resources to this new crisis, but the past few weeks have shown one thing for certain: there is always a way that the situation can get worse."

Others are desperate members of Syktyvkar's poor, simply trying to survive in the midst of this turmoil. Most are somewhere in between, disaffected citizens who have lost faith in the democratic government to give them the basic necessities of life. The sheer magnitude of these lootings, their spontaneity, and their low priority given the abundance of more severe dangers to the Republic have disincentivized a serious police response, making it unlikely that many of the thousands of perpetrators will face justice in the near future.\n\nWhile not a direct political challenge to the state's security, these lootings symbolize the grave fact that many of Komi's denizens no longer respect law and order.

Despite being outnumbered significantly by the police, the right-wingers' ferocity and their use of ambush tactics made the attack a massacre. Ten police officers were killed, with at least twice as many wounded, with only a single assailant killed in response.\n\nNow even more heavily armed, Komi's right-wing will likely continue its bloody quasi-insurgency against the state.

Armed paramilitaries stand guard around the clock, leaving the police seemingly powerless to take the building back for the citizenry. One can only guess what is taking place behind those walls, but the streams of rightists moving in and out of them suggests that the center is being used for training, coordination, propaganda operations, or other such activities.\n\nIt is always worrying to see the far-right gain ground, but such aggressive moves suggest that the fascists are preparing for crises yet to come.

A recent attack on a weapons storage facility led to the Passionarist perpetrators making out like bandits, humiliating the police in the process. The pitched battle killed more fascists than officers, but they still got their prize: a cache of military-grade equipment that could easily be put to use performing more mayhem in the streets.\n\nAs losses continue to roll in for the police, many of Syktyvkar's residents are beginning to wonder whether they can rely on anyone, other than themselves, to protect them."

Only luck prevented shrapnel from ripping through over twenty people; the device, an improvised explosive made from spare parts, failed to detonate. The police are hard at work searching for the culprits, but the remote nature of the operation makes finding them unlikely.\n\nTo say the police caught an enormous break would be an understatement.

Of course, she did not have to stand alone against her enemies. There was always the option of allying herself with major figures in the Party like Suslov or his rivals. Their extralegal help would alleviate a lot of the strain from stabilization, and it would allow her to focus more resources on other necessary functions. Of course, there was the obvious consequence that whoever she accepted aid from would gain influence in the party, which could prove dangerous. Was it worth obtaining aid if it'd lead to her being stabbed in the back later on? Would her not leaning on the Party for help lead to her government being overthrown by someone else? Neither option was completely ideal, but hopefully she'd be able to handle the consequences of either one."
 NIK.277.a:0 "We can rely on the Republic's resources."

 NIK.278.c:0 "To hell with "party unity", go it alone!"

 NIK_278_zhdanov_alive:0 "Like everything in Komi, choosing who to align with was not easy. While Bukharina theoretically had the total support of the Communist Party, the reality was much more complex. The various factions all had their own goals, and while they supported her to an extent, it was obvious that they withheld a certain amount of their resources for their own purposes. This left Bukharina with a tough choice: who?\n\nShe could align with Suslov, gaining support from the orthodox communists. However, such a move would only boost Suslov's already powerful control of the party. On the other hand, she could align with Zhdanov, but that would risk his influence growing greater as well, albeit allowing the two of them to check Suslov's power. Theoretically, she could lean on only her own people in the party for aid, but that would likely signal a huge blow to the party unity. It seemed she'd have to make yet another tough choice."

 NIK.279.t:0 "Raiding the Radios"
 NIK.279.d:0 "Dimitri sat down at the table along with his comrades, trying to calm his uneasy breathing. While he supposed it was natural for him to be nervous, seeing as how Bukharina herself assigned them this mission, it wouldn't be good to be openly anxious. Dimitri took a deep breath.\n\n"Alright comrades, Bukharina herself has assigned us to conduct a raid. I'm sure you've all heard that one anti-communist radio station at some point, the one with the hosts who drink a lot?" Dimitri looked around, seeing nods from everyone present. "Good. It's my job to conduct a raid on that radio station and end its blaring of propaganda. Now, seeing as the situation in Komi is not exactly the most stable, we can't afford to quickly muster up troops, as such a diversion could lead to a counter-coup. Of course, if we take a long time slowly pulling troops, the Republican Guard could catch wind of it." Dimitri paused, but was left unable to continue as another officer interjected with his own idea, spiralling into an hour long discussion. At the end of the discussion, Dimitri was left with a choice: devote a fair amount of resources to the raid, or deeply plan it out, allowing for more forces to be mustered?"
 NIK.279.a:0 "A moderate amount of resources is all we need."
 NIK.279.b:0 "If we don't plan this out and muster more resources, we are doomed to fail!"

 NIK.280.t:0 "Successful Media Blackout"
 NIK.280.d:0 ""While we were able to successfully raid the radio station, we sadly were unable to find the radio operator or any traces of where they might have gone. We restaffed the station with our own people, and it now plays classical music." Dimitri said. Bukharina smiled at him.\n\n"It is slightly disappointing that the operator got away, but I'm happy you and your men were able to end their slanderous broadcasts without issue. Is your report finished?" Bukharina asked. Dimitri nodded. "Good. You're free to go. Enjoy the rest of your day."\n\nDimitri left Bukharina's office, happy. Maybe he'd relax tonight and listen to some music on the radio? There was a new station to listen to, after all."
 NIK.280.a:0 "The airwaves fall under our control."

 NIK.281.t:0 "A Complete Silence"
 NIK.281.d:0 ""During our raid of the radio station, we were able to capture someone. The information acquired from him let us launch secondary raids, allowing for the group coordinating the broadcasts to be captured. They are now under our custody." Dimitri said, proud. Bukharina smiled, very pleased.\n\n"Well done, comrade! I am very impressed with your efforts, and am happy to see that I have good, competent people in the army. Give your men my congratulations and thanks for their hard work." Bukharina shook Dimitri's hand. "I hope you can keep up the good work, comrade.""
 NIK.281.a:0 "Nothing feels better than success."
 
 NIK.282.t:0 "The Airwaves, Alive!"
 NIK.282.d:0 ""Our apologies for a delayed broadcast tonight, some of Bukharina's lot thought they'd actually try to shut us down!" The radio broadcaster said, before drinking some alcohol. "Thankfully, the legitimate army, in the Republican Guard, came and helped us out! They even managed to bring a tank and dealt heavy casualties to the communists."\n\n"You'd think the so-called government has better things to do than raid our little quaint radio station, eh?" The other broadcaster said, chuckling. "Maybe they're not as powerful as they seem, if they can't manage to knock us out? In any case, let's get to our program tonight: how Bukharina's government is doomed to fail!""
 NIK.282.a:0 "What a disaster."

 NIK.283.t:0 "Fascists Raid Supply Caches!"
 NIK.283.d:0 "Bukharina stared at the messenger, growing more and more angry. "You mean to tell me that not only have the fascist militias raided supply caches, but they raided the supply caches meant for wounded civilians?"\n\n"Y-yes Comrade." The messenger fidgeted, unsure of what to do as Bukharina scowled at him. She looked at the messenger, taking a deep breath and unclenching her fist.\n\n"Please leave, you can finish later," Bukharina said. The messenger left. Bukharina slammed her hand on her desk, ignoring the pain. She'd known that the fascists were absolute scum, but to steal supplies meant for innocents? Did they have no sense of care for the people at all? Civilian casualties may be acceptable losses for the fascists, but they weren't to Bukharina. She'd have to try to pull supplies from somewhere else ,or counter-raid the fascist caches to make up the loss. It would be hard, but she could do it. After all, she'd come this far, right?"
 NIK.283.a:0 "The people shall be protected!"

 NIK.284.t:0 "Further Escalation?"
 NIK.284.d:0 "It was calm. Fighting had been low-intensity, at best, and major raids had been nonexistent over the past few days. Bukharina was aware that no one was finished, and that such a calm period was merely all sides reconsolidating their forces. She leaned back in her chair, drinking a cup of water. While it would be easy to wait for the other factions to make a move and respond from there, now was the perfect chance to make a move of her own.\n\nBukharina saw herself with two major options. First, she could move to lock down the streets, sweeping them clean of the opposition. Such a move would strengthen the internal security of Komi, and help stabilize the regime. Of course, this move would also move her to a more defensive stance as she consolidated her power in the territory she had.\n\nThe other major move she could make was to go after the leaders of the opposition. By cutting off the head of the snake, the opposition would be left prone, allowing her to solidly beat them. However, if the assassination attempts were to fail, the fighting would escalate dramatically, leading to more bloody and risky battles. There was a third option, where she locked down the streets and went after the leaders, but such a move could easily leave her overextended and prone to a countercoup. Bukharina gently rubbed her temples as she mulled over her options."
 NIK.284.a:0 "Lock down the streets, we need internal security."
 NIK.284.b:0 "Go after the leaders."
 NIK.284.c:0 "We need to do both to secure the regime."

 NIK.285.t:0 "Kosygin Survives!"
 NIK.285.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Alexei Kosygin has survived our attempt to assassinate him! While we were able to begin the process of poisoning him, Kosygin quickly realized something was amiss and was able to seek medical attention, leaving him with no lasting effects. Kosygin has also managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with the method of assassination, in poison, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."

 NIK.286.t:0 "The Assassination of Alexei Kosygin"
 NIK.286.d:0 "It was only noon, but Kosygin already felt tired. Attempting to restore democratic rule in Komi was no easy feat, but it only seemed to grow more and more stressful. He gently rubbed his temples in an attempt to stave off his headache, to no avail. Did he have any meetings scheduled today? He tried to think through the pain in his head, the sporadic gunfire interrupting his attempts. Damn it, he couldn't remember. Maybe some water would help?\n\nKosygin greedily drank a cup of water, finding that he was parched. It tasted... off, to say the least, but it had tasted that way for a while. It was of no issue to him. He began walking back to his desk, accidentally bumping into the wall. Shit, how out of it was he? Maybe he should just try to sleep? Kosygin stumbled to his room, finding that his center of balance was off. He fumbled with the doorknob, straining his eyes to focus on it.\n\nKosygin all but fell into bed, only just remembering to take his shoes off before pulling up the covers. Yes. A nice, long nap would be good, he thought, as he closed his eyes. He would never open them again."
 NIK.286.a:0 "A peaceful end."

 NIK.287.t:0 "Voznesensky Survives!"
 NIK.287.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Nikolai Voznesensky has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The soldiers sent to deal with Voznesensky were successful in their attempt to capture him, but he managed to escape when they were en route to the location where he was to be hanged, escaping into the streets. Voznesensky has managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with Voznesensky's frankly astounding escape story, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

 NIK.287.a:0 "How the hell did he escape that easily?"

 NIK.288.t:0 "The Assassination of Nikolai Voznesensky"
 NIK.288.d:0 "Voznesensky awoke to a gun pointed at his face. Fuck. The soldier holding the gun gestured for him to get up. He reluctantly did, seeing that he had no other option. The soldier escorted him outside, to a truck. Voznesensky noted that some of his guards laid on the ground, dead. Damn it. He'd grown too used to the sounds of gunfire, and ignored it at a critical time. The soldier escorted him into the back of the truck, and it began to move.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Voznesensky realized something. There was only one guard. Maybe it wasn't the end yet. The soldiers hadn't tied his hands, confident that they could stop him. He just needed a distraction, and then he could make an escape. Voznesensky waited, knowing that something would come. This was Komi, after all. An thunderous boom suddenly echoed, leaving Voznesensky's ears ringing. Now was his chance! He leaped forward, punching the guard. The guard's head slammed into the side of the truck. Voznesensky turned and leapt from the back of the truck, tumbling on the ground. He shakily stood up, brushing himself off.\n\nThe truck had driven off, but he had to get away from here. Voznesensky turned down the first street he could, only to see a communist tank.. He tried to step back, hoping that he hadn't been noticed. The tank moved until the barrel of the gun was pointed at him. Voznesensky closed his eyes, knowing death was at hand. At least it would be quick."
 NIK.288.a:0 "A roundabout manner, but it worked."

 NIK.289.t:0 "Stalina Survives!"
 NIK.289.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Svetlana Stalina has survived our attempt to assassinate her! Her guards were able to intervene before she was taken away by our soldiers, and she is now in a hidden location. Somehow, Stalina has managed to obtain access to a radio station, and has broadcasted all across Komi about our assassination attempt. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the democrats decrying our underhanded methods, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism may become more desperate..."
 NIK.289.a:0 "We must prevail!"

 NIK.290.t:0 "The Death of Stalina"
 NIK.290.d:0 "Stalina stepped outside, only to be met by communist militiamen. They pointed her guns at her, not even allowing her a chance to say a word before they grabbed her and put her in the back of an army truck. Shit. This was very bad. Was there any way for her to get out of this? Where had her guards gone? Stalina tried to figure out something, anything, but to no avail. After an hour, the truck stopped.\n\nStalina was escorted outside, into what appeared to be a small patch of forest, fairly distant from any life. Suddenly, it all became clear to Stalina what was going on. She was walking to her execution. Was there any way she could possibly escape? Stalina looked around, desperate. No. It seemed her death was inevitable. She took a deep breath.\n\nIf anything, Stalina would face her demise with dignity. After all, what else could she do? The soldiers stopped her. One of them offered a flask, filled with alcohol. She drank much more of it than she expected. It felt comforting, as much as liquor could possibly be. Stalina closed her eyes as the soldiers pointed their guns at her. She thought of her father, of the war, of everything she had done in Komi. Maybe in the end, it would be worth it. Maybe someone would rise to bring a better world to this mess of a planet. Maybe-\n\nStalina's thoughts ended, as the soldiers fired upon her."

We can't conduct a follow up raid, as Gumilyov is now hidden somewhere in Komi. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide.

He sprung from his bed, rubbing his eyes in an effort to wake himself up. He stumbled out of his bedroom, becoming more and more aware of the nearby gunfire. Shit. His guards escorted him towards the back, checking each room and hallway for a communist. The gunfire intensified, as they approached the outside. There would be hell to pay, Gumilyov swore to himself. No communist bastard would attack him and get away with it.\n\nAs Gumilyov stepped outside, he was struck by the utter pandemonium. The gunfire was constant, and although his destination was only a few steps away, it took nearly 5 minutes before he could successfully enter his backup truck. Unmarked, it was perfect for a getaway. One of his guards tried to start the engine. It sputtered and failed. Gumilyov felt a sharp pang of fear as the guard tried again, the engine again failing to start. He could feel his heart beat faster and faster. The guard tried one more time, finally getting the engine to start. Gumilyov didn't have time to feel relieved, for he was overwhelmed by a bright flash, tearing him and the entire truck to shreds."
 NIK.292.a:0 "Only ash remained."

 NIK.293.t:0 "Expelling the Radicals"
 NIK.293.d:0 "As stability returns to the Republic, it is the government's responsibility to ensure the maintenance of order. The political radicalism that brought Syktyvkar to the brink of civil war cannot continue if Komi is to be the successor of the Russian nation. The democratic coalition needs to be able to identify and deal with extremists, and to do that it needs to delve deep into the government.\n\nThe radicals would never have gotten as far as they did if it had not been for a large network of sympathizers that penetrated wide segments of society, up to and including the government. Bureaucrats on the left and the right provided covert aid and deflected blame for their crimes. For a liberal republic to function, it cannot trust ideological opponents of democracy to run it.\n\nThe age-old question of liberty or security presents itself once again. The first option is to conduct limited sweeps, retaining especially experienced, trustworthy, or repentant officials. The second is to fire even all of those who were merely associated with the extremists, if only to be sure."
 NIK.293.a:0 "Only a dictator would persecute so many political opponents."
 NIK.293.b:0 "Fire them all. It's the only way to be sure."

 NIK.294.t:0 "A Compromise Candidate"
 NIK.294.d:0 "Within the large democratic coalition formed in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, there are already tensions. The SMR, PSD, and DSNP are parties with great and substantial differences that are difficult to reconcile even with the necessity of a united front against radicalism. If they are allowed to simmer, these divisions may lead to the splintering of the coalition, a death sentence for Komi's fragile political order.\n\nEven symbolic overtures have value in these trying circumstances. To show good faith, the ruling party will replace the Vice President of the Republic with a representative of another party in order to emphasize the unity of the governing bloc in its respect for democratic values. As there are two subordinate parties, and obviously only one Vice President, the government will need to make a choice. Whose support is most necessary to ensure stability? Which party will have the President's ear, and which can safely be sidelined?"
 NIK.294.a:0 "Komi needs the PSD's strong hand. Choose Stalina."
 NIK.294.b:0 "Only the DSNP can placate the masses. Choose Kantorovich."
 NIK.294.c:0 "The SMR knows what must change. Choose Kosygin."

 NIK.295.t:0 "Locking Down the Government"
 NIK.295.d:0 "While radicals don't believe in democracy, they will certainly take advantage of it. Either by entering the legislature or infiltrating the bureaucracy, they undermine the government from within to foment dissatisfaction among the people. Despite the ruling coalition's hard work, all it would take is a wave of radical candidates capitalizing on a disgruntled public to bring Komi crashing back down into chaos. Until the situation is under control, they must be frozen out by any means necessary.\n\nWhile not ideal, delaying elections and suspending appointments is a must for the short term. Blocking communists and fascists from the government will, over the long term, weaken them by denying them the platform they crave, and it will allow the democratic parties the time they need to stabilize the political situation. By carefully screening candidates, the government can ensure that officials seek to serve the people over their ideologies.\n\nThe state can see far, but it can't screen everyone. Perhaps it would be a better idea to focus on shutting down just the strongest organization's attempts to infiltrate the political system, rather than needlessly diluting its power. As both the left and right rebuild in silence, it may not be so easy to tell which one is the closest to striking again."
 NIK.295.a:0 "Take down the Reds."
 NIK.295.b:0 "Don't let a single fascist in."

 NIK.296.t:0 "Outside Assistance?"
 NIK.296.d:0 "The political violence that shook Komi until recently has significantly depleted the supply of reliable soldiers. Large numbers of fighting-age men joined radical organizations and were consequently deemed unreliable for recruitment into the military. Outside of Komi, however, there is no shortage of men with many guns and few principles.\n\nVologda, with its supply of weapons and lack of severe politicization, has great potential as a source of soldiers, and a delegation of mercenaries from there has in fact already contacted the government, expressing willingness to fill the gaps in our security in exchange for generous compensation. They claim to be veterans of the West Russian War with a significant amount of experience and seemingly have no loyalties besides the pecuniary.\n\nWith anti-state sentiment as widespread as it is, mercenaries may be the most loyal force Komi can find on short notice. More importantly, the state is hardly in a position to turn them down. Nevertheless, some in the government argue that those who don't believe in its ideals cannot be trusted to protect democracy."
 NIK.296.a:0 "Komi needs every man it can get."
 NIK.296.b:0 "Our safety isn't for sale."

 NIK.297.t:0 "Traitors Among Us!"
 NIK.297.d:0 "There were those in the government who raised hell over the decision to hire mercenaries, calling it a close-minded, foolish move that would only endanger Komi in the long run. Recent events have more than earned them an apology.\n\nThe mercenaries hired from Vologda deserted only weeks after they arrived, citing low pay and unfair restrictions put on them by the state. To "compensate" themselves for their trouble, they carried off a treasure trove of loot from several of Syktyvkar's banks in the process. Their loyalty to the Republic was clearly illusory, but their military experience was very real, as they brutally demonstrated to a patrol sent out to stop them. Now, with fifteen casualties and a gaping hole in the front lines, the military situation is worse than before they were invited in.\n\nThe government will have its hands full trying to manage the public relations disaster in the coming weeks, but an even greater issue looms overhead: with too few soldiers and a clearly unreliable mercenary base, how will it defend the people of Komi?"
 NIK.297.a:0 "A military fiasco."

 NIK.298.t:0 "The Curfew"
 NIK.298.d:0 "The city of Syktyvkar has recently enacted a 9:00 PM curfew, for the sake of security and curbing radical activities. The reaction of the citizenry has been mixed to say the least. Komi's people have always had an uneasy relationship with their government, and while some dutifully obey the restrictions, others flout them en masse.\n\nThose working late shifts or making midnight shopping trips have no intention of going along with the new rules. This puts the government in an uneasy position. The curfew needs to be enforced if it is to have any effect on security, but asking already struggling people to neglect their livelihoods is obviously unfeasible. Is there a middle ground? How many restrictions are reasonable when the average person has only a small chance of coming into danger?\n\nThe opinions of the government are divided. The more liberally minded believe the current measures to be unreasonable and possibly counterproductive. Others believe them to be too lenient, and a third faction has tried to stake out a compromise, with armed escorts returning violators harmlessly to their homes."
 NIK.298.a:0 "Excessive policing will only harm public morale."
 NIK.298.b:0 "Armed escorts are both secure and flexible."
 NIK.298.c:0 "There's no such thing as too many night patrols."

 NIK.299.t:0 "Night Raids"
 NIK.299.d:0 "By this point, Komi's democratic hardliners must feel like Cassandra of Troy. Their warnings against a premature relaxation of the curfew were ignored by the government at its own peril, and they appear to have been proven right.\n\nThe decrease in policing following the lessening of restrictions caused an almost immediate uptick in violent crime and terrorism. Over twice as many incidents occur at night when compared to the period of extensive enforcement, and multiple government installations have fallen under attack by unseen elements. While concerns over the impact of heavy enforcement on civilians were understandable, they sorely underestimated the extent to which chaos still reigns on the streets of Syktyvkar. Now, as weeks of carefully earned progress start to unravel, the politicians who advocated for such measures have only themselves to blame.\n\nThe sole silver lining of this situation is a broader consensus that the government needs to take a firmer stance. If the hardliners' counsel falls on more receptive ears, future crises may be resolved with the appropriate amount of force."

This legally binding coalition will remain in place until otherwise directed.\n\nAny member of the Komi National Assembly who disputes this Presidential Directive will be expelled from their position. Replacements will be determined by the leader of the coalition. As the leading representatives of their respective parties, party leaders who reject the coalition or publicly undermine its authority will be expelled and prosecuted for treason.\n\nAll legally recognized parties which refuse to join the coalition will be considered threats to the stability of the Republic and consequently outlawed."\n\nThe Directive complete, Stalina leaned back from the typewriter. Perhaps it could be more formal, but what was formality in these times? It certainly wasn't of any use at the moment, with the Assembly in total chaos and more than a few members dead or missing. Still, at least a semblance had to be maintained if the Republic's legitimacy was to be salvaged - for that, the PSD would need a respectable partner.\n\nA burst of gunfire in a distant street sounded through her office's sole window - a reminder of the urgency of her endeavour.

All standards and regulations which apply to that institution shall also apply to the Komi Police Force. The extant structure of the Komi Police Force shall be maintained, pending..."\n\nThe typewriter's clacking ceased as Stalina's fingers stopped in midair. She hadn't really considered reorganization when first formulating the idea of militarizing the police. It seemed logical - why put them under military command but maintain their same ineffectual structure? She leaned onto her desk, steepling fingers in thought. Subordinating the notoriously weak-willed police commanders to reliable military officers would probably provide better results, but the success of that move could not be guaranteed; the police were ferociously independent, after all. Perhaps a slower, more... organic approach might work? Of course, that would mean leaving the police and military to sort it out themselves. There was no guarantee that would work, either. Maybe taking charge herself would be wiser after all."

Their 'organic' reorganization has been completed, but not without days-long arguments, multiple resignations and more than a few arrests of problematic elements. The effectiveness of the police has been severely hampered by these setbacks and radical civilian elements are running rampant with the army pre-occupied dealing with the paramilitaries.\n\nThe police chiefs are back to work and have set their men to putting out the fires, but our government's image has taken a severe hit from its failure to reorganize law enforcement.

Small concessions have been made to appease the understandably nervous police, but we have gained far more than we've ceded from this effort.\n\nPolice detachments are now learning to work effectively in tandem with army units and friendly paramilitaries. Civilian unrest is being rapidly quelled with the police no longer having to worry about attack by well-armed radical groups, providing a tremendous boost to morale."
 NIK.303.a:0 "Blue and green, working in harmony."

 NIK.304.t:0 "A Successful Reorganization"
 NIK.304.d:0 "Grigorenko reports that the Komi Police, having accepted President Stalina's orders without quarrel, have been successfully subordinated to his officers without too much trouble. There has been some grumbling at the sudden militarization of police ranks and conduct, but they understand their duty to the Republic.\n\nBoth civilian and paramilitary radicals are being pushed back throughout the Republic, with police and soldiers working together well.

All protests will henceforth be considered illegal, disruptive to the efforts of our security forces and a threat to the stability of the Republic. Protesters will be arrested and prosecuted on charges of endangering public safety, or treason in cases that severely hinder the work of our security forces.\n\nThe Komi Police Force is authorized to use force to disperse protests, if such action is deemed necessary."\n\nThe Directive was short and to the point; Stalina was pleased with her work and smiled as she passed the final draft to her secretary. However, her elation was short-lived as, once again, the sound of a large mob assembling outside reached her ears. Doubtless some radical sympathizer in the Assembly had caught wind of her intention to crack down on protests and spread it to the public. As of the moment she finished typing it, however, it had become law - one word to the head of security downstairs, and the rowdy plebs outside would be dispersed or otherwise dealt with. Perhaps the citizens of Komi, unsure of Stalina's leadership, could use an example to get them in line."

 NIK.307.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nMikhail Andreyevich Suslov, de-facto head of the communists in our Republic, has been successfully arrested. Our informant's tip-off was correct - the Communist Party's headquarters was not in fact abandoned. A bunker beneath the building, probably dating back to the first German invasion, was serving as their base of operations. The main entrance, hidden in the building's archives room, was sealed. Our troops were forced to resort to explosives to breach it.\n\nFortunately, the communists had not been alerted to our discovery of the bunker. They were caught completely unaware by the assault team, who met minimal armed resistance and suffered no casualties. Some of the traitors were able to escape into tunnels exiting elsewhere in the city, but Suslov himself was still in his office when our troops found him. He had to be bloodied a little before being cuffed, but is in good health and awaiting your judgement.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

The tip-off our informant provided was correct; we successfully located the bunker underneath the Community Party headquarters. However, someone must have also tipped off the Reds to our approach. When the assault team breached the bunker, all they found were empty rooms. The armory, archives and offices were all stripped bare, leaving only things like furniture behind.\n\nThere were a dozen tunnels leading out of the bunker, exiting all over the city, so there's no indication of where Suslov might have fled to. Knowing him, he probably has several bolt-holes in every district. We've no idea where to begin searching. Awaiting further orders."

 NIK.309.d:0 "Frigid Ural winds drew moisture from Suslov's eyes as the bag was finally ripped from his head. Blinking and looking around, he saw his guards arrayed in a circle around him, faces stony and eyes filled with contempt. Beyond them was... trees? No, a forest. That must have been why they disembarked from the truck hours ago and continued on foot to wherever Stalina had ordered them. They had travelled by road for at least six hours, so they were clearly some distance from Syktyvkar. Yet, the President herself had not accompanied them. Perhaps the cause was not yet lost...\n\n"Gentlemen," he began. "Please, consider for a moment what you have been-"He got no further. Something hard cracked against his skull, causing him to stagger forward and bump against a guard, who shoved him back. "Shut up," spat the sergeant, who stepped forward and produced a small scrap of paper from his pocket. "Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, you have been accused of operating an illegal paramilitary, theft of state secrets, 71 counts of blackmail, 342 counts of conspiracy to murder, one count of murder-"\n\nSuslov sputtered, words finally failing him. "Tha... this is preposter-"\n\nThe sergeant paused for a moment as someone else slugged Suslov in the side. "Thanks, Ilya. You are also accused of acting as a hostile agent and carrying out acts of espionage for a foreign power in attempts to subvert the laws and constitution of the Komi Republic. The court finds you guilty, and sentences you to be shot."\n\nSuslov blanched, a ghost in the fading light trickling through the canopy overhead. He opened his mouth to speak - then heard the distinct sound of an AK being cocked. "What do you think you're..." The rifle cracked, but there was no sudden crunch of Suslov's skull shattering. Instead, he toppled to the ground with a gasp as the bullet punched through his tattered shirt and deep into his gut.\n\nHis world faded into a blur of browns and greens as someone kicked his glasses away and crushed them underfoot. Then the pain hit - a sudden, unbearable rising of blood and bile from the core of his body. Suslov screamed as he felt the lump of hot lead lodged somewhere beneath his stomach. "You fucking bastards! Just... god- FUCK!" The blurs of grey standing above him began to move out of sight, their footsteps muffled on the layer of moss and fallen leaves. "NO! No, don't... don't just leave me here! What-?"\n\n"That's all you get, you rat," someone called back to him as they moved further away. "Let's see you slip out of this one.""

 NIK.310.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nLev Nikolayevich Gumilov, leader of the so-called 'Passionarists' is in our custody after some mild difficulties. As you suspected, he was still in the city itself, probably to coordinate the rightist paramilitaries. He was running his operations out of a district post office previously thought secure. Recon informed us that the building was heavily defended by concealed machine gun positions, so a stealthy approach was out of the question. We rolled up a BT-76, which drew their fire and kept them suppressed as our assault teams moved in.\n\nHeavy fighting followed the breach. Assault teams reported final tallies as five of ours wounded and two killed, with all twenty-four enemy combatants neutralized. Gumilov was cornered in the postmaster's office, but took us all by surprise when he threw himself through the window rather than be taken by our men. It wasn't much of a fall, but he was bleeding quite badly. The medics patched him up just fine - at least, once our boys had stopped kicking him for giving them the runaround. He's now in a cell with a medic on standby.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

 NIK.311.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI'm sorry to say that our attempt to arrest Gumilov has ended in total failure. The rightist paramilitaries provided much tougher opposition than we expected. They might even have been expecting us. When we surrounded the old post office they were hiding in, we thought they were just cornered rats. But something went wrong - like our recon had it completely wrong. We only expected to face machine gun nests and a platoon or two, but they'd turned that place into a damn fortress. We brought in a PT-76 to take out the MGs, but they had enough RPGs to turn it into burning scrap in the space of thirty seconds.\n\nWe suffered too much attrition, got too frustrated. The assault teams got reckless and tried to advance without cover - got torn to pieces. We didn't have the numbers to keep fighting when the rightists staged a breakthrough in a couple of trucks and sped off to another district. Gumilov must have been with them, since we found some of his personal effects in the building but no sign of the man himself. I'm sorry, ma'am - we just couldn't catch up to them."

No longer appearing a carefully-groomed intellectual in a tailored suit, Gumilyov had clearly taken his brief stint in prison hard. His suit was already little more than black and white rags after the fall through his office window and the subsequent beating at the hands of Stalina's men. Did that bitch expect him to stand trial looking like this?\n\nEvery pair of eyes he passed turned to Gumilyov as he was half-dragged down the cold, dim concrete hallway. Rightist militiamen crowded into cells stood in silence, while their leftist neighbours jeered and shouted obscenities at the ragged man who had once been their most dangerous foe. "Popular, aren't you?" quipped the man holding Gumilyov's right arm. "Sorry you aren't going to have an audience for the next event. We're keeping this a low-key affair. Probably more suitable for a man of your standing, don't you think?"\n\nGumilyov didn't make a sound. Even without the gag wound tightly around his head, he wouldn't have dignified their chatter with a response. He just stared ahead into the gloom, closing off his ears to the din of the prisoners and guards all around him. Individual voices faded into an indistinct cacophony as he rounded a corner.\n\nAfter that moment, nobody ever saw Lev Gumilyov again - save for the guards who slit his throat, threw him into a shallow grave and riddled his prone form with bullets until their guns clicked empty."

 NIK.313.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI'm pleased to report that Andrei Zhdanov has been captured following a series of raids on his known safehouses. After the first few were empty, we started to lose hope, but then one of the assault teams assigned to the warehouse district radioed in to say they'd got him. Funny thing, too, actually - his guards were the ones who turned him over to us. Apparently they'd had enough of him. We still had to arrest them, of course, but we've agreed not to charge them with anything. I hope you will accept that deal, ma'am.\n\nZhdanov is in a cell now - a padded one, mind you. Something's snapped in that man. He wouldn't stop ranting, so we gagged him. Kept struggling, so we gave him a beating. Got back up after a while, so we brought in a doctor who said he needed to be put in a straitjacket. That was too much bother, so we've just got him tied to a chair for now. Personally, I would ask that we deal with him as quickly as possible so he stops harassing the guards every time they walk past.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

If Zhdanov isn't in the city anymore, he's probably fled to the forests or an outlying village. We'll never find him if that's the case, not with so many troops and police tied up in urban areas.\n\nFor now, I've withdrawn the search parties and put them to work trying to find possible leads on Zhdanov's location.

How much further?"\n\nDaniil nodded and tried to point ahead with his right shoulder. "Just past the treeline. There's a nice drop there."\n\nThe prisoner had recovered somewhat by the time the trio finally came to a halt - enough, at least, to begin ranting again. "You don't know what you're doing!" came the undignified shriek of a thoroughly terrified Andrei Zhdanov. "You're all out of your minds! The Republic NEEDS me - NEEDS the Party! Stalina will-"\n\n"Pipe down, dickhead," muttered one of his guards - which, Zhdanov couldn't tell. "Now, uh..." There was a sound of crinkling paper and a throat being cleared. "Andrei... fuck, can't read this handwriting for shit. Whatever. Andrei Zhdanov, you've been charged with blackmail, conspiracy to murder, um... treason..."\n\n"Abram, it's just us here. You don't have to read the whole damn thing. Let's just finish him off already."\n\nBeneath the sack, Zhdanov's face blanched and his eyes bulged. Without the covering, he might have been taken for a madman. "No, please! Please, both of you, just listen to me! Stalina, that crazy bitch, she's going to run Russia off a fucking cliff!"\n\n"No," replied one of the guards. "That would be you, Comrade Zhdanov." Someone gave him a shove, and suddenly Zhdanov felt himself falling. He screamed in sheer terror - and continued to do so all the way to the bottom of the cliff."

Finding her was almost too much of a challenge for us to handle, truth be told. That woman has a veritable legion of sympathizers in her party and a much cleaner reputation than Suslov. There weren't many people who caved under pressure, even when we had irrefutable proof they'd been in contact with her.\n\nWe did get her in the end, though. One of Suslov's cronies spilled the information, said she was a threat to the unity of the Communist Party. Wonder what his boss would think of that. Anyway, we found her in a civilian's apartment, probably some working-class devotee who's been sheltering her.

In a corner, out of sight and out of mind, a truck was parked with a single wooden coffin in the flatbed. Everything else had been cleared away save for the post to which the traitor would be tied. The firing squad was silent, standing at ease yet visibly uncomfortable; they'd never shot a woman before.\n\nBukharina was led out of the cell block precisely on schedule, five minutes after the firing squad had arrived and been given time to prepare. It was best, the President had decided, for this particular operation to be carried out as quickly and cleanly as possible, given its nature. What made it distinct had not been elucidated to the warden, but he was an old servant of the law and was not given to questioning his orders.\n\nThe firing squad was brought to attention the moment Bukharina appeared. This, the warden understood the necessity of. Best not to let them be in an unprofessional mindset when the time came, unlike with the previous executions. This could be an unusually difficult task for them, given the woman's relative distance from the most extreme elements of her party.\n\nBukharina kept her eyes cast downwards as she was marched to the post and tied firmly in position. No prayer escaped her lips, and no unsurmountable terror set her to quivering.\n\n"No, thank you," she murmured with a grim expression as the warden produced a blindfold from his pocket. Stowing the strip of soft fabric, he hesitated for a moment before producing a small silver flask and unscrewing the cap. He offered it to her with an expectant look, no malice in his eyes. Bukharina smiled sadly and nodded. The warden brought it to her lips, allowing her to enjoy a deep quaff - one last taste of home before the end.\n\nThe warden replaced his flask and stepped away. The first rays of sunlight crept over the prison walls. "Firing squad!" he shouted clearly in the cold morning air. "Ready!"\n\nThe men snapped to with drilled precision. The warden's voice echoed around the yard, bouncing off the stone walls. Bukharina inhaled, deeply and slowly.\n\n"Take aim!" She exhaled, feeling the weight of years flow out of her with her last breath. Uncertainty, fear and doubt left her mind. Only clarity remained - and the sense that she had always tried to do the right thing. Others would carry her torch. That was enough for her.\n\n"Fire!""

Always a loyal follower, but never quite afraid to let his superiors know what he thinks. Leontiy doesn't reply, staring only at the mist. There are some boundaries it would be thoroughly inappropriate to cross. The sanctity of Command is one of them.\n\nAs he glares into the mist, something clicks. Those faint figures aren't trees - they must be the nearby hills. And if he can make out the hills, then - He scrabbles at his map, checking the faint contour lines. If he's lucky, he can get the shape of two landmarks down, like that one shaped a little like a loaf of bread, and the elongated ridge -\n\nLeontiy is a grown man of 37 years, and he's been in and out of barracks for his entire adult life.

On all sides Ust-Sysolsk is embattled, and the armies grow ever closer in the black night, like a sheet, over the borders.\n\nIt grasps the hearts of senior citizens who watch the false-cheerfulness of the news and look into long-darkened closets, wondering if the old firearms are still working and if their aim is as sharp in their old age as it was at the first. So too the hearts of soldiers and generals, stifling their cheer and dulling the gleam of their boots. No one is willing to say what they really think, but all are looking to their old homes, and to reprieve in gentle obscurity. There is a time coming when they will no longer have the luxury of the former.\n\nThere is a cold silence, too, in the leadership. The options of the Republic have run dry. There is no one coming to save them, and what good is a government if it cannot look its people in the eye and tell them that things will, in due course, get better? The staffers, of course, are forbidden from even discussing such things. It scarcely matters. Just as ravens sense the coming of a storm, so too can the public sense the inexorable approach of a problem Komi can no longer deal with.\n\nIn a village to the south of Syktyvkar, children play the timeless games of all children everywhere: they run, aiming mock pistols and bows at each other, giggling as they hide behind walls and bushes.

However - now that the National Army is prioritizing securing the streets of Syktyvkar and cauterizing the city, the commanders of the armed forces are of two minds in how to proceed with dispersing the protestors.\n\nThe first proposal, the more obvious one, is to use the might of the Komi National Army to break the protestors, disperse them with violence and street combat. This will ensure, of course, that the army demonstrates who is in control, but it will also likely cause unnecessary death in an army already stretched for manpower.\n\nThe second option proposes that Serov and the army send civilian infiltrators, associated with the military or Serov's supporters, into the protestors and ingratiate themselves with those who organized the protests. When the time is right, the infiltrators will wreak havoc and collapse their organization. What should we do?"

Others, however, have pointed out that doing so would hurt our already-fragile control over the government.\n\nBy not negotiating with the militias in control of the arsenal, we may not have access to the tear gas that could be instrumental in suppressing these protests, but if we avoid using the gas, even if it means more pain for us now, we may gain some legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

The guard panicked and shot him, putting a hole right through the soldier's mask. Taboritsky, he was the one behind this. They had to move quickly.\n\nA brief but intense firefight ensued. Andropov and his men all scored several kills against the surprising number of stormtroopers that had entered the building.

Next were the courts, who are redundant when the Regent, and eventually the Emperor upon his glorious return, can do their job for them.

It was addressed to Sergei Taboritsky, leader of the Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire, a minor right-wing faction. However, Taboritsky also had his elite stormtroopers, fanatics who would gladly die for their leader and his cause. Taboritsky was fanatic in his loyalty to Tsar Alexei II, who he believed escaped execution by the Bolsheviks. This posed a number of problems for Gumilyov. Firstly, Tsar Alexei II was almost certainly dead, so Taboritsky's mental health could be called into question. This meant he could be unreliable. Secondly, Gumilyov was not a monarchist, he doesn't care for the Tsars, and he honestly just doesn't like Taboritsky.\n\nIn his letter, Gumilyov worked around their differences, appealing to Taboritsky's desire to see Russia's borders expanded to their peak under the Empire. Some of these claims were natural: Retaking Moscow, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, among others. Gumilyov also made some more extravagant claims, including hinting at the possible annexation of Alaska. Gumilyov felt ridiculous proposing such a thing, but Taboritsky seemed like the kind of man who would make such extravagant claims.\n\nWas all of this really worth it? Taboritsky possessed some very elite paramilitaries, but were they necessary in order to overthrow the Republic? Taboritsky was also a strong orator, with a decent support base. Including the monarchists in Gumilyov's coup could lead to a power struggle if he failed to keep them in check. Gumilyov still held the letter in his hand, he could just tell his assistant to burn the thing, and just do without Taboritsky's monarchists.

He could use his newfound power as leader of the Republic to expand the conscription laws, although it could cause some unrest, and there was no guarantee of quality. Or, Gumilyov could, despite his dislike for the man, ask Sergey Taboritsky to lend his elite stormtroopers to the Eurasian National Army, who would form the core of his new military.\n\nThe obvious problem with this plan was that the stormtroopers were, above all else, loyal to Taboritsky. They may swear allegiance to some long-dead Tsar, but Taboritsky was their de facto leader. If he relied on Taboritsky's stormtroopers too much, Taboritsky could use his influence over them in order to take power.\n\nThis choice was effectively a question of quality vs quantity. Expanding conscription would give him quantity, although they would likely take longer to be trained, and likely wouldn't be as effective as the stormtroopers. The stormtroopers may be comparatively few in number, and possibly politically dissident, but their fanaticism made them a terrifyingly effective force."

The arsonist - or artist, as they'd probably think of themselves - had certainly been visionary in their use of palette. Bold lines and strokes formed the foundation for an extravagant, if confusing, mosaic of red and black. Here and there what appeared to be the angular form of planes - rockets, perhaps? - arose from the scintillating mist around them, nestled in the ocean of red font like Venus of Botticelli.\n\nAnd at the bottom of it all a slogan: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW WITH TODAY'S SOCIALISM - FOLLOW THE VISIONARY LINE.\n\nEvanoff sniffed. They'd have to do better if they wanted to impress the headmaster of the Kotlas School for Young Artists. Dipping a sponge into her bucket of water, she began to scrub the amateurish enthusiasm away. Perhaps their next work would be more inspired, or at least less excessive in its use of outlines.\n\nThe next week the propaganda was back, bolder and more garish than ever. The arsonist, whoever they were, had evidently reacted by doubling down. Bolder and crazier the red mist foamed in every corner. New symbols of progress, arrows reaching ever upwards, lifted atop a sea of crimson arms and hands holding hammers. Above them all, a rocket bearing the spindly wheels of the atom rose like Jupiter into shaded red sun-rays.\n\nThe slogan had at least been shortened. ZHDANOV TODAY - THE STARS TOMORROW!\n\nMs Evanoff stared and stared, and then she began to giggle. It was so bold, it was almost endearing. She grabbed a paintbrush and began to write a note in blue paint. If the culprit was coming back on a regular basis, perhaps she could at least teach him a couple of things about that damned outlining.\n\nAnd so it continued, this strange courtship, and on the walls new slogans blossomed, as if heralding the coming of some unimaginable spring."

The massive stack of paperwork on his desk, only ever shrinking by incremental amounts, was not helping his migraine.\n\nEach of the papers he was reviewing had to be individually approved by the Party General Secretary and the Chairman - both positions now belonged to him. Signatures on the front and back, approving a very precise pattern of redactions upon their work. And the redaction was only the beginning - for those who were still alive and relevant to these papers had to be brought before the General Secretary and vetted for approval. An approval like this next one, and, God, he was thirty minutes behind schedule. It would have to be quick.\n\nZhdanov waved at a Guard to bring the next person in.

He gazed in confusion for a moment, and then he knelt and bowed to the General Secretary, his whole body trembling with the effort.\n\n"General Secretary, please revise my removal from the Party!

Artem and his family were of this category, specifically. An aide to a deputy who frequently spent hours away from home, his wife and children had done their best to... adhere to his busy schedule. And now this; Sergey Taboritsky standing on the Assembly floor giving a speech- partially composed, partially raving.\n\nMinutes turned into hours, but Artem was barely paying attention to the debate on the floor- where would he and his family live? How would he explain the move to the children? They had friends here, and they would not be pleased to hear their father telling them that they had to pack up and leave their life behind. And what of his wife? Valentina had done her best to stay by his side, no matter the long nights he was away. What would he tell her? They already likely knew of the news- but what was he going to say?\n\nEventually, the debate ended, and the time came to go home. Artem walked calmly, and opened the door before moving into the living room. They were waiting. They were watching. "What news?" Valentina asked, as Artem opened his mouth to speak."

He'd trained himself to tremble less, and at the right spots to keep his gunsights level and his aim clear, but the price he paid for it was that shooting felt less like an action and more like a twitch. The target seemed so very far away, and he thought of his home, now further still.\n\nLoud and clear the old voices rang in his mind: "Only a man can fight for his home. Only a man can do this. And if the rebuilding of Russia needs anyone, Fyodor, it needs you." His parents, his brother. The Army had long been his second home, but he'd never forgotten his duty to the first.\n\nThe crucifix around his neck shuddered as the shots rang out - one, two, three, then silence. Fyodor lowered his gun. It seemed he'd been mostly on point for today's rounds. The stained hammer-and-sickle icon that passed for a target had been shot into oblivion, its white scraps hanging on the wire-lattice base. The Sergeant nodded, wrote chicken-scribble numbers into a book, and dismissed him. As Fyodor left, he smiled wanly. Perhaps rifle inspection would be late today - well, it invariably ended later than anyone could predict, and far later than anyone was ever comfortable with. At least the meals were better now that they'd ousted that damned Bolshevik in the canteen...\n\nDmitri nodded to him as he passed into the cramped bunk-quarters. Little talk was necessary, and little talk was offered. Two men cleaning their weapons together - a pastime as old as time itself, and as the two traded rifle oil and cleaning-brushes there was an air of near-amity.\n\nDmitri finished, reassembled the bulky mess of parts into its gleaming whole. Then he knelt, taking well-worn beads from his left pocket, and began to mumble as the beads slipped between his fingers. A prayer for enemies, and for Sytkyvkar, and for the men who would lay their lives betwixt the two."

In truth, I was thinking of adopting oaths from the ones most familiar to us. We are, as you know, a Christian nation, but not all our subjects have had the privilege of baptism. My advisors have suggested a modified version of the Soviet oath - "\n\nHe raised his hands against the already-spluttering Priest. "And yes, we are well aware the Church would not be pleased with this, to put it lightly. Which is why I was thinking of a simple Oath to the Russian State, until the spiritual health and loyalty of our subjects are ready for a full oath to God's appointed trustee.

Arguments fly back and forth between each side- those for it claim that, even ignoring the obvious religious reasons, such a move would undoubtedly win favor from the local populace.

However, an interesting situation has cropped up- one that requires our attention.\n\nIt has always been a habit of the Bolshevik to betray their nation, and it seems that this phenomenon has cropped up yet again. Numerous Red officers, when told of what they would be tried for, seem to have had a sudden ideological change of heart. These rats in uniform seem to be more than willing to switch sides, betraying their old friends for a new job and a shot at survival.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that these men- if they can be called such- will be any more loyal to our army than their old haunts, the Army can always use experienced officers.

The question that has plagued multiple warlords over the years now falls to us- what do we do about the Mladorossi?\n\nOn the one hand, their beliefs- as unorthodox as they may be- do mostly fall in with at least some of the Komi Right.

Without either of those posing a serious challenge, the cracks had widened into chasms, and it was no longer expedient- or really even tenable- to maintain the alliance. Across the Right, the pieces fall, as Passionariyy members proclaim their loyalty to one side or the other.\n\nMost importantly, however, was which way Serov and Taboritsky would fall.

Shafarevich had been the young face of the Passionariyy, and had been expected to have a long career in front of him.\n\nOf course, events changed all that, and suddenly Shafaverich found himself not as second in command to one faction among many, but second in the leaders of Komi. This was not a position he particularly wanted, and his split from Gumiylov's wing drew much attention. Most analysts agreed, however- Shafarevich had made his move too early. His bid for power would come up short, and then he'd surely be in for it.\n\nWhen the vote count was finished, and Shafaverich was named the new head of state, the National Assembly fluttered with confusion and mild surprise. It was nowhere near the shock of what would have happened from a Serov or Taboritsky victory, but it was enough to surprise many. As the men and women of the Assembly filed out, Shafarevich took a moment to savor his victory. Soon, he could really get to work."

Both men were the only two standing, facing down the Assembly, to the center. The rest of the Assembly was stunned into silence- not even able to voice their shock and disbelief.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke?" Gumiylov asked, the color draining from his face. The man at the center shook his head. Shafeverich and Gumilyov shared a look- terror, perhaps, or disbelief- and turned back to the man. It couldn't be true.\n\nAnd then, they began to leave.\n\nIt started as a trickle of shell-shocked representatives before the dam broke, a cacophony of footsteps desperate to get out of the way of the hell that was soon to come. Serov and Taboritsky watched the fleeing masses before their eyes locked onto each other. Gumiylov and Shafaverich were gone, thrown into the trashcan of history- the question now was whether Taboritsky or Serov would follow them. The little goodwill built between the two would soon fall to pieces, and then the final battle over Komi's future would begin."

His hands trembling, he points to the Coalition and snaps, "It was - it was the Romano-Germanics that did this! They have usurped the will of the People, putting impostors in my - our place!" As his own followers stare at this sudden lurch into idiocy, the spell is broken. Gumilyov finds himself the centre of a gradually widening circle, and as he is dragged out of the hall for disorderly conduct no one follows him, or bats an eye.\n\nTaboritsky, conversely, chuckles. He bows his head and he begins to laugh, in uproarious bursts that heave the breath from him, and when he is finished he wipes the tears from his eyes. His eyes shining, he points towards the ceiling in rapturous wonder and proclaims only this:\n\n"I have been wrong. All this time.

The rise of Taboritsky and Serov to become real contenders for the Convergence had left him thoroughly rattled, and he felt more anxious than he'd ever expected to. He drew some calm from his ally, however, and kept his composure. A few minutes later, it was finally time to announce the results of the vote.\n\n"The winners of the vote and leaders of the Passionariyy are Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich." The Assembly erupted into cheers, their supporters expressing the relief also washing over him. As Igor got out of his seat, he was pulled into a big hug by Gumilyov, the force of which betrayed that his ally, too, had carried doubts of their success. It didn't matter anymore. Their gambit had worked. They had won. They had secured the future of their movement, and they had shut out the NKVD thug and the delusional tsarist. As he knew deep down that they would. This was their movement after all.\n\nThe defeated candidates wasted little time in rallying their supporters and leaving the assembly. They would have to be dealt with, of course.

Their respective supporters are already on the move, and life is once again brought to a terrified stop as a fierce power struggle plays out on its streets. While it's hard to predict which of the two men will emerge victorious, the consequences of victory are easy to foresee.

With his military connections, it seemed obvious that the final struggle between the two would be somewhat slanted towards him, and the confrontation was indeed brief.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, several reported awakening to the sound of gunshots, and multiple military and paramilitary forces "occupying" several locations ranging from homes to pivotal roads, with several of Taboritsky's deputies being awoken and dragged out at gunpoint. As for Taboritsky himself, rumors abound to his exact location, though most agree that he is no longer in Komi.\n\nSerov is now the undisputed master of the Republic - though with his former allies gone, one can question how much his power base has been afflicted by their removal.

Masked men were seen breaking into the residences of Serov's closest supporters and taking them away to an unknown location. The action has proven a decisive one, as most of Serov's inner circle seems to have been seized successfully, the rest having gone into hiding and Serov himself also missing. There are multiple rumours surrounding his whereabouts spreading, but a growing number of reports agree he's fled Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Taboritsky is now the master of the state. With his erstwhile allies gone, however, their fates unknown except to their captors, his base of support appears precariously diminished.

To some of his pleas he gains nods of acquiescence, while others reply with questions, or cold defiance.\n\nAnd yet, he continues. Why? Perhaps he's genuine. Perhaps he never left the party at all, and perhaps Suslov got him wrong. Perhaps he's looking for men he can get brief support from, and then depose of them when he no longer needs them.

We could put their skills on our side, or we could release them solely to let them live their retirements out as civilians. On the other hand, they gladly fought against us. Perhaps they have earned their stays in jail.\n\nVologda's generals are characterized, much as their regime was, by a lack of ideological rigor. This quality led them to lay down their arms in the face of the German onslaught, suggesting that they may simply not be reliable for our future moves against the Reich. However, it could be that their decisions were simply made in the face of a collapsing WRRF, and their pragmatism is a worthy quality when serving under a government perpetually vexed by ideological radicalism.

Perhaps they have earned their stays in jail.\n\nVyatka's generals fought on behalf of a self-proclaimed successor to the Tsar and sought to install a Russian regime that shares the most commonalities with far-right elements within the Republic. Entrusting their ideological fellow travelers with our army may therefore prove a poor idea. Nevertheless, it should be noted that Vyatka was not an ideological monolith much as its White predecessors weren't, and that many of its ideologues, including some of the army, desired something akin to our own democracy.

One could very easily argue from a nationalistic or pragmatic point of view that empowering resitive minorities would only lead to instability in their home regions. From a humanistic perspective perhaps more in line with republican values, giving the Bashkirs concessions in the form of letting their generals serve may provide a very small smoothing of our relations with them.

 komicoup.2.d:0 "The first sign of trouble is when a Representative who leaves on smoke break doesn't come back to the Legislature on time. It's a common ailment for the smoke-lovers of the Republic: cigarette breaks last far longer than they should, partially because of the sheer difficulty of procuring sticks from the chaotic supply routes traceable to India and China. Every cigarette break is a luxury - to be savoured, not expended.\n\nEven so, a cigarette break is physically incapable of lasting for a full hour, and at 2:30 pm a search party is sent out to reprimand the Representative and get his voting record on the present Bill. Decorum is decorum, after all.\n\nIt is quite a surprise when the search party instead discovers armed men outside the doors of the Congress - as a furious scuffle begins between the reluctant gunmen and the furious Representatives, shots are fired into the air. Guards rush to the defense of the beleaguered politicians from within the chamber, and the session becomes an armed standoff between two very irate groups of ageing men and women.\n\nIt is comical, for about five minutes: then the armored column arrives. Red-stars splayed on their sides and banners waving from the hatches leave no doubt as to who masterminded this little action. From the first tank Zhdanov and Suslov clutch little ushankas. Zhdanov is yelling like a cowboy to the other tanks, almost exuberant, while Suslov is unnervingly silent. Crowds gather round the column, yelling slogans and waving banners of their own.\n\nAs the column aims their considerable armaments on the Parliament, options narrow and vanish. Army units refuse to assemble, or simply dissolve like snow at a fingernail touch. At precisely 3:18 pm the Komi Republic is dissolved - as honorary General Secretary, Zhdanov reads the first address of the newly formed Soviet Socialist Republic alongside his new premier, Suslov."

These general strikes are not met with immediate action, and Government representatives, for once, fail to show up to reassure the angry workers marching in the streets.\n\nNo one is precisely sure where the explosion of military support comes from, either - was it the patient work of the Commissars, or the spontaneous action of radical-sympathisers in the militias, or both? Either way, no one is surprised when military barricades set up to 'calm the workers and point them back home' simply join the demonstrations, riding the popular tide. Personnel carriers left abandoned by their sides are commandeered as vanguards, their sides festooned with red flags as they move into the Capital.\n\nThe final attempt to rebuff the wave of popular dissent comes in front of the Legislature itself, which is currently in session. The armed escort of guards suddenly seems small next to the crowds that have swelled into the streets, their presence almost minimal. As the workers demand an entry into Congress to air their views on several pressing workers' rights issues, a gunshot is fired from an unknown source.\n\nHistory's wheels are spurred into action.\n\nThe rush into the building is quick, even if it is violent at times: workers drag assemblymen out of their seats, some still struggling with their captors, and atop the podium Svetlana Bukharina is proclaimed new Premier of the Komi Soviet Socialist Republic. A slyly smiling Bukharina is called in on one of her rare rest-days, formally asked to take on an terribly confused Suslov, and the Worker's Action ends with its ringleaders in equal triumph and disarray."

 komicoup.4.d:0 "One morning, the streets were filled with the long absent sound of air raid warning. A cold tide of panic descended upon Syktyvkar's citizens, amplified and directed by uniformed men on the streets. The paramilitaries warned of war, of violence, of civil breakdown. Those who questioned the instruction to stay indoor and find shelter were beaten. A few citizens of the capital were simply dragged into waiting cars and disappeared by the men in uniform.\n\nHuddled and waiting, with every radio frequency jammed, the citizens of Syktyvkar waited. The end of the air raid sirens did not coax them out of hiding. Only a few brave or foolish runners could be seen in each district, their coming and going observed by the unknown men.\n\nThe news only brought more questions to the paranoid atmosphere of the Capital. Men loyal to Ivan Serov had stormed the legislature before it could break for lunch. Decrying the democratic and communist politicians both as traitors willing to stand aside as other warlords plot the end of Syktyvkar, the paramilitaries forced a dissolution of the government at gunpoint. Ivan Serov was sworn in as emergency ruler, legally entitled to defend a new Ordosocialist constitution.\n\nThe citizens of the republic were used to propaganda, and learning between the lines was the only way to stay informed. The new government's forceful declaration that "traitorous and degenerate political leaders'' all await execution in a safe location have little credibility in the absence of evidence. Rumors ran of various communist and democratic leaders having escaped the coup, and of far right elements lurking in the shadows to end this new ordosocialist government. But the element of surprise for the day was Serov's, and so this new "national worker's state" is free to take its first few steps into the wider world, a chimera of komi's far left and right."

The clanking sound echoed all around the plaza as the metallic gas canisters bounced off the wall of the assembly. From a mechanical hailstorm came the chemical mist, an opaque cloud of teargas. The roof's sharpshooters watched in dismay as their view of the plaza was taken away. A few of the most proactive riflemen urged their comrades to head inside the building. The others stood numbly, looking over the whtie shroud.\n\nOn the ground, the policemen choked and gagged.. Struggling to keep good order, they hit the deck and began crawling toward the legislative assembly, intent on regrouping indoors. Before anything the black figures were on to them, gas masks availing no expression as the policemen were beaten into submission by Taboritsky's men.\n\nThe men of the assembly could offer no resistance as the men of the OVRI entered the room.

Armed troopers secured each bridge over the Vychegda River, disarming surprised garrisons without violence. WRRF soldiers on the far side looked on as one group soldier tried to make a stand, only to see its position shelled by mortar fire. Soon after, the trickle of soldiers turned into a flood. The government's soldiers were boxed into their barracks as democratic militias invaded the capital. Leading the offensive were the elite Republican Guard, the best trained defenders of the former democratic government. The Guard's IFVs had cordoned off the legislative assembly by the second hour of the invasion. No politicians were in the assembly at that time of the day, of course; they were hiding somewhere in Syktyvkar. Not that it mattered, for the streets were now littered with checkpoints. There would be time enough for the extremists to be found.\n\nThe Republican Guards's technical experts swiftly overtook every strong radio station in town. The same message was put on loop, informing citizens that the previous government had been an illegal affront to the democratic ideals that every man and woman of Komi should adhere to. The Republic would be restored by a government of national reconstruction , the message informed them, with Svetlana Stalina being given emergency power as a president.

Patrols now raced to capture the city hall, leaving bodies and spent casings in their wake. Without their security forces, the current government was no more. Forced to surrender at gunpoint, officials abandoned their buildings, hands up as they streamed into waiting trucks. Those who resisted were beaten into compliance or shot for ceaseless defiance.\n\nBut at last, they have done it. The restoration of the Republic was accomplished, punctuated by the broad declaration of a state of emergency. Soon enough, the victorious Republican Guard and their supporters made ready to greet their returning President.\n\nFrom the steps of the hall of Syktyvkar, the legitimate government can begin its term.

Blowing up trains. Assassinating important generals and leaders. But no matter what he did, they just kept coming.

There had been a time, she reminisced, when she would have considered that a personal failing - one that she would need to rectify through whatever means she could pull out of her repertoire of learned and tested stratagems.\n\nBut it was no matter. It was difficult to make use of her previous tricks in this grey Hell.\n\nHer objective had been sighted in just the sort of circumstance she expected. Down the hall from her cell was the blocks they used for solitary confinement - blocks that she occasionally heard faint screams from. Screams that made her grit her teeth, and pace across the few square meters of space that she had been permitted by the Government's mercy. In the time she had spent to stare through the bars at the corridor, she had seen two guards dragging a short woman between them, away from solitary - a woman who still extruded an aura of ashen defiance and faded passion. A woman who she had known all too well.\n\nIn the distant past, she had considered eventually breaking her will as a sad inevitability, something that had to be done to realize her vision. But looking into her eyes whilst she had been dragged down the corridor betrayed a different outcome than the one she had expected. Whilst her infamous stark white suits had long been replaced by prison orange, whilst her formerly disciplined and tightly bound hair hung loose and unkempt, Svetlana Stalina was unbowed and unbroken. The Lady of Steel, it seemed, had merely been tempered, and not shattered.\n\nAs she passed on down the corridor, and out of view, Bukharina felt a thin smile cross her face. They may have been bitter foes - opponents that both recognized the other would have to go in order to build the future they desired. But, in the end, in the shadows of both of their defeats, she felt nothing but pride at her former enemy's defiance, and a resolve to adhere to the same standard."

Her vision for socialism is the true successor to her father's Soviet Union, and I will not stand by and let Zhdanov's reactionary tendencies lead our revolution astray. I feel that," Furtseva repeatedly glanced at Zhdanov as she spoke, "I feel that Bukharina's awareness of the oppression that many citizens of the former Soviet Union faced is crucial to our movement's survival. Women, Komi, Tatars, and all of the other marginalized groups within the shattered Union must become true members of the revolution! We must embrace them with open arms, not shun them for not being Russian!

This question had stumped the Chairwoman for a few minutes now.\n\nLooking into her past, Furtseva had first gained the Communist Party's attention by writing a scathing critique of a film displayed in a Syktyvkar theater and its satire of the former Soviet Union's leadership. She called for the Communist Party to boycott the theater until it cut all ties with the film's director and stopped displaying the film. It had worked, and she was elected to the former Republic's National Assembly later that year. Furtseva had arrived before Bukharina's popularity surged, and had already allied with Zhdanov when Bukharina arrived in Syktyvkar. This past could mean that she was a reformist, and renounced Zhdanov when it became clear that Bukharina was the real force for reform within Syktyvkar. Alternatively, she was always an Ultravisionary, and was working with Zhdanov to undermine Bukharina.\n\nFurtseva clearly cared about cultural matters, and clearly wanted to ensure that revolutionary ideals properly reached the public. The question was: what ideals? The position was fairly limited as well, a mere administrative manager, but it was the principle that mattered.

Evidently he had been sorely mistaken. While political status shouldn't determine employment, he felt that teachers should have standards about their biases. Whichever teacher was the subject of all these angry letters to his office evidently did not.\n\nHere was the problem. A number of parents were noticing that their children came home with... skewed understandings of Russian history. One letter described a seven year old who, upon being asked what she had learned in History that day replied that Russia had been a land of opportunity before Lenin had the tsar shot and brought women into the workplace. Another described a writing assignment apparently requesting that students "write about what the nation means to you, and what should be done to those who don't respect it." There were eight similar letters, and as the school was legally required to be politically impartial, something had to be done about it.\n\nSorokin started by requesting that Nadya look into the teachers' backgrounds, and she quickly came back with a likely suspect. Viktor Bugakov, a history teacher for six months, had both a criminal record and an OVRI membership card.

It had become a widely cherished children's book in areas of Russia still controlled by communists, and even among the communists in Syktyvkar. It was a story of a young communist boy named Timur and his friends helping the public and furthering the revolution in any way he could... and it was all based on him. Timur Gaidar had once been the very boy that Arkady Gaidar had modeled the Timur of the book off of.\n\nIt was incredible to think of how long ago it had been published. 1940, a year before the invasion. He had been a young boy then, an eager Bolshevik, following in his father's footsteps. Now he served people his father would angrily declare traitors to the revolution. Ah, revolution. What a joke.

Would a finitely generated group in which elements have finite order would be a finite group? Intuition seemed to say yes. How could finite elements of limited scope generate that which is boundless? Yet, naive intuition was dangerous to any mathematician. Now, the algebraists had an angle of attack toward building a counter-example. For a given field, an infinite dimensional quotient group could be built under certain conditions. From there, solving Burnside's problem was much simplified; all one had to do was create such a quotient group generated by finitely many elements of finite order. This would warrant at least some interest in Russia's dwindling mathematical community. Perhaps in the outer world, someday?\n\nVerifications were moving ahead rapidly. Golod leaned back into his chair, the warmness of the tea mixing with the satisfaction of work well done. In this instant it was so easy to imagine a path not travelled, a Russia not ravaged by war, not divided by scheming generals and politicians.

It seems that the Americans Serge Lang and John Tate had centered some of their work around what come to be known as the Tate-Lang group. This group consisted of the elements of the Weil-Châtelet group of a number field K that are trivial within all completions of K. This notion had equally emerged from Shafarevich's work in the fifties with collaborators. Intriguingly, the Americans had not been able to determine if such a group was finite.

People responded well to anti-communist rhetoric, they responded well to their economic policies, and they responded well to Russian nationalism. If he could keep Shafarevich and his peers to continue walking the narrow line, Volkov could work miracles.\n\nVolkov then had a realization. Volkov was crucial to getting Shafarevich elected. Shafarevich was crucial to the rest of the Passionariyy. Therefore, Volkov could probably get himself a raise."

 komi.35.d:0 "He had gone and truly done it now. It was supposed to be a simple debate between Shafarevich and Deputy Morozov, the only native Komi in the Assembly. He had told Shafarevich to focus on the failures of the Coalition and the economy, but Morozov had brought up Shafarevich's small nation concept. Shafarevich then decided to explain the concept, and it wasn't exactly flattering for the RNP. Volkov had thought that Morozov was just a token representative, but it appears the Komi politicians was more skilled than he had thought.\n\nThis was not the apocalypse however. Sure, data looked poor after the debate, but Volkov had a procedure for these types of situations.\n\nFirst, Radio Free Syktyvkar. Ivanov and Ivanov were the best free advertising money couldn't buy, but if he slipped them a few "donations" he could certainly get them to weave a new narrative. Voznesensky never failed to deliver a new scandal, and Ivan Ivanov could give Shafarevich a flattering, friendly interview, where Shafarevich could moderate his message for the public. Secondly, send out some press statements to the newspapers, and convince them that Shafarevich's words were taken out of context.\n\nOnce all of that had been done, get the public's attention onto someone else. One of his militias had found a KPK weapons stache near a Deputy's home, he could twist that into a proper scandal. As Volkov went over his plan, he knew this was salvageable. He started writing the first letters, and his new narrative began to take form."

 komi.36.d:0 "Leonid Volkov was stumped. There was a district that the RNP wanted in their hands. The district's elections were a while away, but to steal this district things needed to be set in motion as soon as possible. The district's former deputy, a DSNP candidate, was not planning to run for re-election. His successor was sufficiently milquetoast, and Volkov could certainly find a more charismatic candidate. That wasn't the issue here. The real problem was that the district had a large minority demographic, mostly Jewish. The RNP wanted to marginalize this demographic, and ensure that the National Assembly was serving the Russian nation's best interests. To Volkov it was a noble goal, but a difficult one to get into the Assembly.\n\nObviously none of Gumilyov's Eurasianists would do. He found his man in the form of a Passionariyy Society member who owned a successful business in the district. He was a gregarious guy, and had even appeared on the radio once. That was the candidate settled. Next was the issue of demographics.\n\nVolkov wasn't sure how to get a majority in the district. Then, he realized that he didn't need a majority, just a plurality. Volkov just needed to make the district apathetic enough to lower turnout, all the while drumming up support behind his candidate. A smear campaign against the DSNP and their upcoming candidate would ensure that they were no threat, and soon the RNP would have that seat. Volkov pushed up his glasses. If he started now, this election could have effects even beyond this single district."

I would like to thank President Shafarevich for giving me the opportunity to speak today..." Igor smiled as Kuzmin glanced at him. The vice president was nothing if not an eager soul. "It is he, after all, that holds the sacred traditions of Russian culture to be among the most important aspects of our state. In this task, I have faithfully worked with him to build a better future for all Russians, while making sure to keep our past safe from dilution. Bad faith actors with no regard for our people who have infiltrated Russia have worked hard to build a certain narrative about our origins..."\n\nShafarevich felt his smile begin to fade ever so slightly. He didn't remember seeing this tangent in the script. Perhaps he forgot? "Indeed, a certain small nation would have you believe that the Russian people share blood with that of our adversaries, but what if I told you that these were nothing but disingenuous lies by the charlatans of the clergy? Our ancestors' roots grew deep, tempered by the blood of ancient Celts since time immemorial. If not for President Shafarevich..."\n\nShafarevich's mouth hung agape as the vice president continued. His expression had gone from cautious pride to that of sheer horror. He gestured across his neck as Kuzmin looked his way once more, clearly indicating his wish for the speech to come to an end."

However, what was known was that he led a democracy with social aspirations, and this mollified some of the people...at first.\n\nThen, Voznesensky's personality and his scandals made their way into the limelight. Tabloids, radio talk shows, and word of mouth spread like wildfire as Orenburg was brought into the fold and to the surprise of no one, divided the people. However, despite the arguments for and against him, the general reaction seemed to be largely...muted. Indeed, despite the occasional group of workers or farmers voicing mild complaints, for the most part they were content with how he was running things. Burba didn't seem too aggravated by him, nor did he seem to be too much for him. If anything, the main reaction to his new hold over the Urals was- apathy."

Chairman Malenkov himself was none too pleased at being "deposed", even if the government had simply placed him under temporary house arrest and under investigation. The streets were taken to on occasion by protests, and though some welcomed the end of what they saw a tyrant, others- loyal to Malenkov's ideals, or loyal to the wealth and power they had had under him clashed and bickered.\n\nTo the credit of the new ruling government, they had done their best to slowly, carefully enter the region with an open hand and a welcome voice- but Orenburg was nowhere near as open to their thoughts as any optimist could have claimed."

 komi.40.d:0 "The most hated man in Orenburg right now is Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. A drunkard, a scandal-monger, and worst of all, a statist, this brutal authoritarian has shown the people of Orenburg the terrors of corruption, the terrors of racial hatred, and has attempted to force his statist views upon the communes. His ideals of "social democracy" appear to be solely dedicated to ending the anarchist cause, and decimating Orenburg's proud institutions as a whole. At least, that's what Orenburg says.\n\nWhile most in Syktyvkar have reacted to the newspaper headlines of riots and Zhdanov cocktails being tossed at policemen with a raised eyebrow and sigh, anti-anarchist sentiment is at its peak. Thankfully, the President's latest scandals have managed to be overlooked thanks to a few communal riots, and Nikolai is certain that in time, Orenburg will calm down."

Andrei finally chimes, as Dimitry turns.\n\n"Honestly, I kind of like it; it's pretty peaceful, and the President didn't do anything to the guard; he simply asked that we become a...club."\n\n"Organization is the proper term. The Guard is so much more than a club, no matter how everyone may see us- we fought against the bandits. The ghosts of the Black Mountain. And now people see us as a glorified police department, heroes from a 'comic book'." Andrei spat, as Dimitry turned. "I didn't know you read those."\n\n"Anything from Syktyvkar is either raunchy, or cluttered with talk about 'symbolism, symbolism, symbolism!'" He lifted his arms, sighing as Dimitry nodded.\n\nFor minutes, it was quiet once again, besides a small bit of wind, and a peaceful horizon, as the two guardsmen of an older age watched the sun set.

Some said he was paraded back to Syktyvkar in chains, only to die on the journey there. Others however, told many stories of how he died, ranging from the mundane to the outlandishly bizarre- but all had one thing in common, and that was his death.\n\nYears passed, and the memory of the Bandit King began to slowly fade as life returned to Orsk, championed by a president who was more than content to help people get over the horrors of the past, and remove the stain of the great terror of the Urals.\n\nIn the end, Oskar Direlwanger would become a small historical footnote, or on occasion the villain of a story, or tale.

After all these were lesser men, and lesser men did not understand great works. Lesser men did not understand sacrifice. All they understood was how to crave power, and how to make lengthy promises. They had no love for science and no concept of strife. So, he simply sketched in his notebook and kept planning; kept designing.\n\nAfter all, once the Germans came they would finally realize they needed his experiments and beg like lesser men tended to."

It was a gunboat, the first that the docks of Syktyvkar had purpose-built. Mounted machine-guns ringed her hull, and a single 85mm cannon graced her front deck, taking up the majority of the available space. To the assembled military men, she was beautiful. A beautiful solution to the ugly problem of piracy and smuggling.\n\n"Give the dockworkers my congratulations," began Korolkov, surveying the radio antenna on her stout command center.\n\nLigachev nodded. "They've been paid double for laying her down. We'll be getting you another four, provided funding holds up - two more for the Sysola, and two for the Vyatka."\n\nThe newly promoted commanding officer of the Komi Republican Navy stared intently into the water.

 yakovlev.1.d:0 "Out of all the Deputies to come from the former Front territory, none has attracted as much attention as the recent election of Alexander Yakovlev, affiliated with the DSNP. Born to a peasant family in Korolyovo, his father served as a Red Cavalryman in the Civil War and became a leader of a small Collective farm in his village. Yakovlev served in the Red Army during the German invasion, and the horrors he experienced on the Front, including almost losing an arm during the invasion.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fracturing of the country into multiple warlords, Yakovlev's life had been shattered, as the strength and truth of Marxist-Leninism right in front of his eyes. The destruction of his country and ideology forced him to look at Socialism through a different lens, one in which human happiness and quality of life trumped ideological purity.\n\nAfter winning a difficult election in the recently conquered Arkhangelsk Oblast against the wishes of the DSNP establishment, he has established himself as a prominent freshman in the Oblast. Intelligent and reform minded, it remains to be seen whether his left wing credentials can gain him the political power he desires."

 yakovlev.2.d:0 "Despite only having been elected a few months ago, Alexander Yakovlev, a freshman Deputy of the DSNP, has since made himself known as an influential political operator both within and without of the party. He has been instrumental to the Democratic Front in helping ensure party loyalty among Deputies coming from the former Front and elsewhere. While technically coming from a new territory, Yakovlev has been succeeding in straddling the line between being associated either with the party establishment in Syktyvkar or the frontier, making himself out as a possible unifier in the young republic.\n\nHowever, his desire for compromise extends only so far, as many on the right of the DSNP are well aware. Yakovlev's public criticism of those in his own party who have 'betrayed our socialist roots' has made him popular among leftists in Komi. While his economic policies are far from radical in Russia, his forcefulness in such criticism has since made him a prominent member of the left of his party.\n\nWhile still young and inexperienced in the ways of government, it is expected among the party establishment that he will do great things."

A powerful political operative, known for his reformist and socialist tendencies, Yakovlev has gained a following among younger intellectuals, working class trade unionists, and citizens of the Front territory, all of which have made him a powerful figure on the left wing of the party.\n\nWhile once a freshman Deputy from Korolyovo, he has since raised his status as a popular figure among socialists and other leftists within the DSNP, much to the chagrin of the party's right wing. With his fiery criticism of the right DSNP's liberal economic policies and a firebrand desire to uplift the working class of his nation through a newfound humanistic socialism, many expect Yakovlev to seek the Presidency.\n\nAlthough he has kept any hints of seeking the presidency to himself, it remains to be seen if Yakovlev's coalition can overcome the party establishment."

While his popularity was far from what it once was, he has been able to keep the young and unstable Republic from breaking apart.\n\nVoznesensky has not explicitly endorsed a successor, although it is expected he is to endorse his Party's primary winner for the 1971 election. Many in the Republic, however, can not imagine another man to fill his shoes."

 yakovlev.5.t:0 "A Power Play"
 yakovlev.5.d:0 "To the surprise of everyone across the country and beyond, Alexander Yakovlev, a up and coming politician from the Arkhangelsk Oblast, has won the primary to be the candidate of the People's Democratic Socialist Party. Originally considered a dark horse candidate for the party, he narrowly beat out his moderate opponent.\n\nFor years, Yakovlev has been representing the DSNP's left wing for years, advocating for a stronger left wing economic policy, and has led the charge against the party's economic liberalization. This, combined with his support among the former Front held regions, has now catapulted him into his status as a major Presidential candidate.\n\nWhile many on the right of the DSNP grumble about Yakovlev, the center and left wing are openly congratulating the candidate on his victory, and are expected to have even greater representation in the National Assembly. Whether he can win the Presidency, however, remains to be seen."

 yakovlev.6.d:0 "'It is time for a return to the fundamental axioms of those who came before: a republic for the establishment of socialism, a world in which no man has too much nor too little, and an economy based upon the ideals of Marx and Engels. While the right may balk at us, the workers of this nation know who their true enemy is.'\n\nAlexander Yakovlev's speech officially announcing his candidacy for the President of the Komi Republic has been well received by many on the left wing of the Democratic Front and beyond. While his candidacy has just been announced, Yakovlev has met with many trade unionists in both core Komi territory and in former Front territory, which were all met with positivity among working class voters and trade union bureaucracy.\n\nWhile many considered Alexander Yakovlev to be a dark horse in the People's Democratic Socialist Party's primary, his unexpected victory has since capitulated his already impressive political record to new heights. His powerful political connections in the Front's former territory, in addition to his harsh criticism of the right wing of his party, has made him the darling of the left within the Komi Republic. It remains to be seen, however, whether he can succeed his predecessor in maintaining order and stability within our young nation."

 katushev.1.t:0 "The Iron Governor"
 katushev.1.d:0 "With the recent integration of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky, into the Republic, it was considered essential to establish legitimate governance within both it and the surrounding region.\n\nElections for all positions, legislative and executive, were therefore announced and subsequently held. Although many races were competitive, one in particular - the Governor's - was not. Konstantin Katushev, a local engineer and industrialist, and notable for his long-standing support of and advocacy for broadly liberal policies, won by a considerable margin.\n\nKatushev, who entered the regional political sphere as soon as he was able, quickly negotiated with and secured the endorsement of the SMR, commonly known as the Young Reformers, and began proclaiming their general position to the electorate. Proving himself an exceptionally skilled political organizer, he quickly established both a robust and rapidly expanding political infrastructure, greatly expanding local awareness of and support for democratic ideals.\n\nThis infrastructure proved an insurmountable challenge for his opponents, as though several other campaigns outspent Katushev by a considerable margin, none were able to significantly challenge the increasing momentum displayed by his own.\n\nExperts agree that the 'Iron Governor,' as he has been increasingly referred to, is likely to leverage that infrastructure in order to further establish Nizhny Novgorod as a stronghold, both for the Reformers and for their political adherents."
 katushev.1.a:0 "A rising star, indeed."
 
 katushev.2.t:0 "The Party Machine"
 katushev.2.d:0 "As was previously predicted by experts, the continued efforts of the SMR-aligned 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, to establish Nizhny Novgorod as a bastion of liberal idealism have shown results.\n\nOnce again demonstrating a profound talent for organization, Katushev moved quickly following his election to identify local allies, particularly among those who carefully concealed democratic leanings under the former regime, and then appoint them to politically influential positions. Although many of these allies have been criticized by Katushev's opponents as inexperienced and 'eccentric,' counting among their number political novices from numerous menial careers, their inclusion has won Katushev the support of many within the city.\n\nWhile tirelessly working to continuously further expand the political infrastructure established during his election campaign, Katushev has begun to apply that infrastructure in support of the candidacy of other SMR prospects. Indeed, many of the city's National Assembly districts are now held by SMR deputies, and experts predict that the degree of support extended by Katushev's machine is such that they are unlikely to be unseated by their many opponents anytime soon.\n\nUnder Katushev, Nizhny Novgorod has very quickly become a political bastion of the Young Reformers, and the influence of this fact on the political landscape of the Republic as a whole is expected to grow in the months and years ahead."
 katushev.2.a:0 "A beacon of liberalism."

 katushev.3.t:0 "From Oblast to Nation"
 katushev.3.d:0 "The political influence of Nizhny Novgorod, as one of the largest cities in Western Russia and thus the source of a significant proportion of the National Assembly's deputies, has continued to grow. As has the influence of its 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev.\n\nKatushev's now-extensive political infrastructure and, consequently, his ability to mobilize support for the SMR within the region has led to other parties being all but shut out of its Assembly delegation. Indeed, deputies from Katushev's 'domain' now constitute a considerable portion of the entire Young Reformer caucus, affecting the party's viewpoint as a whole. Recognizing this, the SMR has begun shifting more and more of its administrative organs, other than those required in Syktyvkar itself, to the city.\n\nA corollary to this shift in both caucus demographics and organization is the rapidly increasing influence of Katushev within the party on the national level. He has reportedly begun making 'suggestions' on electoral and positional policy, and it is considered likely that other figures within the SMR's senior leadership will be unable to resist them.\n\nAmong oppositional party organizers, consensus has therefore been reached that Katushev is to be considered a critical and near-irreplaceable figure within the SMR, and he has been identified as a prime candidate for potential party leadership in the near future."

 katushev.4.t:0 "Kosygin Announces Retirement"
 katushev.4.d:0 "Earlier today, President Alexei Kosygin announced that he would not seek re-election upon the expiration of his current term, and would instead be retiring from political life.\n\nIn a brief speech, Kosygin made the proclamation while speaking about his personal political journey, from his time spent in the Soviet state apparatus to his arrival in the Republic and later foundation of the Young Reformers. He exhorted the Republic and Assembly to remain true to the principles of democracy and liberalism on which he was elected, and emphasized to his eventual successor the importance of rejecting radicalism of all types within the national political discourse. He subsequently ended his speech with thanks to his many political allies and other confederates.\n\nWhile some experts had correctly theorized the purpose of Kosygin's speech, most appeared to have been taken by some degree of surprise. Whatever the criticisms held by opponents against Kosygin, and they were many, all could generally agree that he had long desired to see political stability in the Republic.\n\nWhether the race for the Presidency, which has been galvanized by the announcement, will possess such stability is currently unknown."
 katushev.4.a:0 "The end of an era."

 katushev.5.t:0 "The New Reformer"
 katushev.5.d:0 "The meteoric rise of the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, has continued unabated as he has recently secured the leadership of the SMR as a whole and thus, its official nomination for the upcoming Presidential election.\n\nLeveraging his enormous personal support and political influence within Nizhny Novgorod in the wake of President Alexei Kosygin's recent announcement of retirement, he moved quickly to position himself as a candidate for succession. Although other senior party figures soon did the same, much as it did in his earlier gubernatorial election, Katushev's early advantage and quick action proved decisive, and he was elected leader of the SMR on the first ballot.\n\nThis surprised many observers, who were expecting multiple rounds of negotiation by candidates among the SMR caucus. However, as was evidenced, the increasing degree of party centrality upon Nizhny Novgorod overwhelmingly favored Katushev, and support for other contenders was seen to quickly collapse among the contingents of SMR deputies not already from districts in or around the city.\n\nHaving secured his party's nomination, Katushev is soon, along with the candidates put forward by other parties, expected to begin his national campaign for the presidency. While many have expressed certainty that the policies of the Young Reformers are likely to find little support outside urban centres, others have been quick to identify Katushev's skills at attractively packaging SMR ideology.\n\nOnly time will tell which opinion proves correct."
 katushev.5.a:0 "All but inevitable."

 katushev.6.t:0 "A Revolutionary Platform"
 katushev.6.d:0 "Konstantin Katushev, known nationally as the 'Iron Governor' and the SMR's nominee for President, today officially launched his campaign in his personal and party stronghold of Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nSurprising many, his commencement speech made no mention of socialist concepts, long considered a cornerstone of SMR ideology. Instead, Katushev spoke strongly in the support of promoting national modernization through comprehensive programs of ecological conservation, the enshrinement of meritocratic principles in both public and private sectors, and in promoting general economic prosperity through the invitation of foreign investment and bilateral trade.\n\nPolitical pundits were quick to respond, with those sympathetic to the SMR praising Katushev's speech as a focused vision for Russia's future. Those opposed were equally quick in decrying it as a thinly veiled attempt to conceal the 'fundamentally socialist' nature of any SMR policies from rural voting blocs.\n\nRegardless of expert interpretation, however, Katushev's speech drew intense interest from many communities across the Republic, urban and rural alike, and the SMR was quick to capitalize on this by issuing an immediate appeal for both the recruitment of local campaign organizers and of general fundraising.\n\nThough a long campaign remains, and none can yet be sure of the election's eventual outcome, Katushev and the Young Reformers have managed to secure a strong starting position."

"Hello?"\n\n"Hello Nikolai! It is me, your cousin Andrey!"\n\nVoznesensky cursed under his breath. Damned Zhdanov. "Andrey! How did you get this number?"\n\n"It does not matter, cousin. Listen, I have to ask you a favor. As you may know, I have been preparing for a long time to put on a really great show for Baba soon, show him a really great party, but then I hear that our friend Alexei has been organizing his own party and it might steal all the attention. That is hardly fair. I wondered if maybe you could get him to tell you his plans for certain... parts of the park where our two parties might overlap a fair bit, so we can know what events he's got planned. That way, things would be better for everyone, yes?"\n\n"I- I don't know Andrey, I understand what you mean, but Alexei is a dear friend of mine, and I am not sure if I can do that to his party."\n\n"Nikolai, please, just a quick peek at his plans, yes? You know you over me a favor, and I've already helped you a lot, as you know. Let us keep on doing that and really surprise Baba, yes?"\n\nA secretary knocked at the door to the study. "Mister Voznesetsky, Alexei Kosygin is here to see you about the electoral redistricting!"\n\n"I'll be out in a moment, Lyudmila! Listen, cousin Andrey...""

 komi_zhdanov_demand.3.d:0 "Voznesensky's receptionist entered his office, saying that an unmarked letter had arrived in the mail. Voznesensky thanked her, and waited for her to leave the room before opening the letter. Zhdanov was certainly getting bolder with a move like that. Voznesensky began to read, dreading whatever demands Zhdanov had cooked up this time:\n\n'To my dearest friend Voznesensky,\nViolence between communist and republican paramilitaries has been increasing as the election grows ever closer. I know that you are a very busy man, especially in such important times as these, but I would like to ask you a favor. Gumilyov and the Eurasianists in the Passionariyy are a serious threat to Syktyvkar, and their influence must be curbed. Tell your gangs and paramilitaries to stop going after communists, and instead focus their efforts on Gumilyov's forces. Once I learn of the ceasefire, I will follow suit. This is a very easy decision, comrade, the rightists must be stopped. I trust that you will make the right decision.'\n\nA ceasefire with the communists would give them time to increase the size of their forces, and they could use the extra breathing room to possibly prepare a coup. However, Voznesensky held no love for Gumilyov, and he certainly wouldn't mind seeing his gangs stop openly roaming the streets. Should he agree to the ceasefire? If he refused, Zhdanov would inevitably release his kompromat, and that would be the end for Voznesensky. The President sighed. It seemed that his mind had been made up for him."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.4.d:0 "Voznesensky entered his office, and noticed an unmarked letter on his desk. He cautiously opened the letter, and began to read. Voznesensky knew immediately that Zhdanov had another demand to ask of him:\n\n'To my dearest friend, Voznesensky,\nI feel that Syktyvkar has been corrupted by greed. They need an example, a leader to show them the virtue of charity. I have gone through the trouble of selecting a suitable organization. I feel that in order to make the message hit closer to home, that the donation should be equivalent to USD $10,000,' that was a lot of money to simply donate out of the blue, Zhdanov was clearly getting more ambitious with his demands, 'I hope you make the right choice. Sincerely, your friend Zhdanov.'\n\nThe charity Zhdanov had selected was owned by a family with personal ties to Svetlana Bukharina. If Voznesensky accepted the demand, he might as well have been paying the Communist Party directly. Of course, Voznesensky wasn't stupid. If he refused, Zhdanov would surely release his kompromat on him. He pulled the checkbook out of a drawer in his desk, but paused as he uncapped his pen. Should he do what was best for himself, or should he do what was best for the Republic? If the information in that kompromat was released, Voznesesnky's career was probably over. With quivering hands, he put the nib to the paper, and watched the ink flow."

And take a quarter of an hour break, you deserve it."\n\nThe secretary thanked him and curtsied on the way out, but Voznesetsky did not pay her heed, he was busy suffering internally. After several long, pained minutes, he opened the letter to see what that accursed Zhdanov wanted from him this time. They were supposed to be friends, and had been for years. Why would he keep treating him like this? He read the letter, and leaned back in his chair with a pained groan.\n\nIncreased press freedom. Could have been worse. An end to persecution of radical left journalists. Not ideal, but fair enough, leaving them alone might even make them less prone to calling for violence against the government."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.6.d:0 "A series of pictures appeared in several large newspapers across the Republic today, taken with a hidden camera at a distance and depicting years of friendly socializing between President Voznesetsky and Andrei Zhdanov. The President has been forced to admit to a longtime friendship with the communist, which has earned him some begrudging respect from the Kosygin and the KPK, but caused a serious loss of authority within his own party, criticism from the PSD, and outright anger and distrust from the Passionariyy. This is definitely a loss of face."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.7.t:0 "Zhdanov's Alliance"
 komi_zhdanov_demand.7.d:0 "Information has leaked about the political dealings the DSNP have been having with the KPK behind the scenes, through the friendship between Voznesetsky and Zhdanov. While it's nothing official, there's plenty of nota and memoranda confirming all sorts of backroom deals, as well as plentiful pictures of the leaders together. This will seriously hurt our position going into the next election, especially as the Passionariyy are shouting from the rooftops about how this collaboration clearly went further, perhaps into the realm of illegality and unconstitutional behavior. We will need a long time to restore our good will among the people and coalition partners after this."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.8.d:0 "A series of devastating leaks have hit our government, seriously destabilizing our authority and possibly crushing our chances in the upcoming election. The leaks allege, and prove with several hours worth of audio tape, pictures, and official government papers, that President Voznesetsky have been involved in abuse of his position from the very beginning of his presidency in order to cut deals with the Communist Party for votes and possibly personal favors. Some of the actions, like the awarding of supposedly open contracts to communist-affiliated cooperatives, are flat out illegal. The DSNP is in full damage control mode trying to avoid an impeachment push led by the enraged Passionariyy, while the coalition is reeling. The KPK, on the other hand, have no comment on the matter beyond stating that there is nothing in the leaks proving that the Communist leaders involved, most prominently Andrei Zhdanov, had any knowledge of how the "gifts" from the President were done illegally. The President himself has locked himself in his office, from where he has been trying to call somebody all day without luck. Our administration may be history."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.9.d:0 "Alone, in a dacha on the outskirts of Syktyvkar, Andrei Zhdanov was smiling as he was going through his papers and documents. Yes, it was all there. He wrote a note to his secretary detailing how to distribute the files to the correct recipients, then stopped and looked at his desk, at the framed photograph of him and Voznesetsky drinking coffee, or at least what passed for it these days, at the very same dacha four years earlier.\n\n"Quite clever, wasn't I Nikolai? Poor, trusting man. You never had it in you to fully separate public and private life."\n\nHis smile faded. "Had you been wiser you would have tried to end it sooner, but your pride wouldn't allow you, would it? You wouldn't have done the same in my position, which is why it had to be done. We must all give something, for the Republic, for Russia, for the Revolution."\n\nHe sighed and flipped the picture to face down, before picking up the next pile of documents to be leaked to the press. On his way out the door, he cast a glimpse back over his shoulder before flipping the light switch. "Goodbye, old friend."\n\nThen the light went out, the door closed, and the moment was gone."
