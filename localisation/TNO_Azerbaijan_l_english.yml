 POLITICS_BAKHTIYAR_VAHABZADEH_DESC:0 "Bakhtiyar Vahabzadeh grew up having two loves: the written word and the Azeri people. He dreamed of his plays and poetry being published without fear of censorship or reprisal, and he longed for the day when Azeribaijan would be ruled by Azeris for Azeris. He was beginning his university studies when the Germans captured Baku, indiscriminately rounding up "partisans" (often just any man of military age who was not a slavish collaborator) and dragging them off to their deaths at the end of a gun or in the depths of a mine. It was by sheer luck that Vahabzadeh was able to escape and flee into the sparsely-populated hillside villages, whose populations had become swollen with refugees.\n\nHere, life continued with some semblence of normality, except for the occasional German terror-bombings. It was also here where Vahabzadeh was able to resume writing poems, publishing them on crude printing presses and distributing them through neighboring villages. His eloquence and fierce patriotism started to generate a reputation for himself, and his works were recited in villages all throughout the Azeri countryside. And when the partisans were able to recapture the cities from the Germans, they chanted his poems in celebration.\n\nVahabzadeh's vision was at last becoming a reality: Azerbaijan was free and independent. But more importantly, they wanted him to lead it. He accepted, though bemoaning that it would delay the completion of his latest poetry collection. And now, he drafts battle strategies and legislation instead of anti-German literature."
