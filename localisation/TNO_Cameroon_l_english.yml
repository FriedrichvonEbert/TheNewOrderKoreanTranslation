Equipped and trained by the Japanese secret service, the Army first returned to the continent under direction of Kwame Ture and Osedne Afana in Summer 1951. Since then, it has become the key organ of the Cameroon African State. It is primarily made up of veterans and returned exiles from the past conflicts plauging the region, but has recently begun recruiting locally. As such, leadership and doctrinal disputes plague the otherwise well-trained and well-equipped African Continental Army."

 ### Events ###
 CAO.1.t:0 "The cameroon african state: Part 1"
 CAO.1.desc:0 "When the French third republic formally declared their surrender to the Germans in 1940, chaos dominated the French colony of Cameroon. It was during this period of uncertainty that the heroic revolutionary Ruben Um Nyobé, after decades of colonial oppression by the Europeans, made his move. After assembling his militias and receiving armaments from Germany Nyobé was able to secure Cameroon. He gave every single one of the colonizers a simple ultimatum, cross the border into British Cameroon willingly, or dragged across it. \n After Cameroon was reclaimed from the colonizers the Union of West Africa, a new state lead by the Nyombé, was founded. The next significant event in Cameroons history occurred in 1942 when, after the collapse of the British Isles, the government of British Cameroon employed brutal methods against their black workers after activist Nnamdi Azikiwe called for a general strike. Unable to bear this injustice Nyobé ordered the armies of the Union of West Africa to surge forth into British Cameroon, quickly liberating the colony and marching what was left of the colonizers into British Ghana. This quickly brought the militias into conflict with the French military units under Charles De Gaulle that had relocated there after the fall of France. Although the French sported superior equipment the militias were better attuned to the jungle, and soon the conflict boiled down to a stalemate along the Niger river. This situation proved untenable for the French and a peace treaty was soon signed, with the French recognizing the Union in exchange for vital rubber exports."
 CAO.1.a:0 "okay"

 CAO.2.t:0 "The cameroon african state: Part 2"
 CAO.2.desc:0 "Although Nyobé was utterly loyal to Cameroon and its people, his belief in the ineffective philosophy of communism proved to be his undoing. The government of the Union of West Africa found itself powerless against the various militia commanders who had all but declared themselves warlords, traveling the countryside pillaging whatever they saw before them. Nyobé himself was assassinated by a traitorous warlord after refusing to allow the sale of children as slaves, and without its charismatic leader the Union started to collapse. The state of the country was utterly ruinous and many would flee Cameroon to escape the violence, but salvation soon came from the unlikeliest of sources. \n \n Dr. Félix-Roland Moumié decided to act after he saw the chaos and blodshed that had consumed his homeland. He soon after joined the radical black-nationalist movement known as African National Liberation. Japanese agents eager to curb German influence in Africa soon contacted him, offering to sponsor his return to Cameroon as he would hopefully be able to develop the Country into a usefull buffer state against the German presance in Africa . Afane established the African continental army, a paramilitary with the express purpose of liberating his homeland. After a short training program sponsored by the japanese Afana sailed to Cameroon with his army and seized power from the disorganized warlords that had occupied it. \n \n After securing control over Cameroon the ACA soon moved against the German colonies in the area, invading the German colony of zentralafrika. Unfortunately, the Luftwaffe was able to strike at the ACA from the skies with impunity, even after they had routed the German garrisons in the area. Peace talks soon began with the Japanese mediating the dispute between Germany and the ACA. This resulted in the Congo basin being given over to the Iberian Union. After the short war, the ineffectual military government of the ACA disbanded and the Cameroon African state was founded. Now, Cameroon looks outward towards Africa, eager to continue the liberation of Africa \n"
 CAO.2.a:0 "Soon all of Africa will be united"

 CAO.3.t:0 "The Expidition"
 CAO.3.desc:0 "The expedition has been assembled, mostly consisting of native workers with foreign experts advising them, these men will soon set out into the countryside of Cameroon in search of an extremely valuable resource, Oil. However, the scientists in charge of the operation have advised that the chance of finding an actual deposit is extremely low. But it would be foolish to simply let this resource sit in the ground unexploited if it is present. The expedition soon sets off in search of the riches of Africa. Wheather or not they'll find any is a completely different matter. "
 CAO.3.a:0 "We can only hope for their success"

 CAO.4.t:0 "The Expidition: Failiure"
 CAO.4.desc:0 "The expedition returned in the middle of the night, most of the members looked crestfallen when they arrived. It seems that our efforts were for naught, and despite extensive searching, not a single deposit of oil has been located. While the scientists are happy that they have gathered geographic data along the journey, it is of little consolation to the other members of the expedition."
 CAO.4.a:0 "At lest they retured safely"

 CAO.5.t:0 "The Expidition: Black Gold!"
 CAO.5.desc:0 "When the expedition failed to arrive on their designated return date, it seemed that they had met a grim outcome. This perception was changed, however, when a few days later the expedition returned in extremely good spirits. It seems that the reason for their delay was the discovery of an Oil deposit in the countryside. After the members return home a second expedition to the site of the Oil is soon planed. The second expedition quickly sets up an Oil extraction operation and barrels of black gold soon flow to the capital. "
