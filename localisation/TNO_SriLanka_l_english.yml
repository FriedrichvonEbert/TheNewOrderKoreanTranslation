 POLITICS_WILLIAM_GOPALLAWA_DESC:0 "If one term could be used to describe William Gopallawa, it would be a man of the people. Almost universally popular among the people of Sri Lanka, it is no surprise that he was appointed its first President unanimously. But Gopallawa, like many, has humble roots.\n\nBorn in 1896, his first foray into the political field was on the Urban Council in Mathale, where he served for 13 years until 1939, as the youngest Urban Commission Chairman in British Ceylon. However, after Mathale, Gopallawa received a promotion, when he was appointed the first Municipal Commissioner of the former capital city of Kandy. Suddenly, Gopallawa, who had been known very little outside of Mathale, became the talk of the town.\n\nGopallawa held to his career, even as the Second World War ravaged Asia and the INA marched into Calcutta. However, when the British regime fell, and they retreated from India, Gopallawa did as his ancestors did, and brought the island of Ceylon under the protection of the closest greater nation: the newly-founded Republic of India.\n\nIn the years since, Gopallawa has served as the Municipal Commissioner of Colombo throughout the 1950s, and, most recently, as Speaker of the Lankan Autonomous District Council. Now, though, Sri Lanka is free, and it is up to him to guide it."
