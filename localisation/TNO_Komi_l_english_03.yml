 komidiplo.1.t:0 "Komi Requests Closer Relations"
 komidiplo.1.d:0 "Our diplomats have received a surprising message today.Ever since the so-called Komi Republic illegally split from the West Russian Revolutionary Front, relations between our two governments have been tense. Now, under a communist government, the Komi Republic has decided to request closer ties with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They seek to reconcile with us over their illegal secession, and engage in peaceful and friendly diplomacy.\n\nOur government is split over what to do regarding this diplomatic request. Some officials call for us to denounce the Komi Republic as illegal splitters who betrayed the front, and instead focus on forcefully integrating them into the Front. Others call for a united Front, and wish to seek warmer relations with Komi, regardless of any past bad blood. A refusal could potentially lead to a future military conflict, but a recognition could show weakness in our government. Regardless, the question is, which clique do we support?"
 komidiplo.1.a:0 "Let us bury the hatchet, and pursue warmer relations with the Republic."
 komidiplo.1.b:0 "These splitters have the gall to come crawling back? Ignore them."
 
 komidiplo.2.t:0 "A United Front"
 komidiplo.2.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. They have agreed to pursue warmer relations with our Republic. The current hostility between our governments shall cease, and communism shall once more present a united front against fascism! We are glad to see that our fellow comrades will not let bad blood betray the Revolution. Hopefully this is just the start of a mutually beneficial relationship between our two governments..."
 komidiplo.2.a:0 "We are glad that cooler heads have won the day."

 komidiplo.3.t:0 "A Split Front"
 komidiplo.3.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. Unfortunately, it seems their government still sees us as hostile to their cause. They have denounced our government as illegal splitters who betrayed the Front in Russia's darkest hour. The West Russian Revolutionary Front have effectively barred our diplomats from their government, and some advisors believe war may be on the horizon."
 komidiplo.3.a:0 "It seems old grudges are more important to them than the Revolution."

 komidiplo.4.t:0 "Shared Training Exercises?"
 komidiplo.4.d:0 "Ever since we began pursuing peaceful relations with the Komi Republic, their diplomats have become frequent visitors to Arkhangelsk. Today their message is different, however. The Komi diplomats come bearing a request from their government to cross-train our troops and theirs. The Republic will send over some officers to our military bases, and in exchange we will send some in return.\n\nIf we agree to their request, we will have to spare valuable officers and risk military information leaking to unwanted sources. However if we refuse we may offend the Komi government and risk damaging relations irreparably. Do we accept the request?"
 komidiplo.4.a:0 "Cross-training our troops can only be beneficial to our goals."
 komidiplo.4.b:0 "We can not spare the manpower, we must unfortunately decline."

 komidiplo.5.t:0 "Fighting Together"
 komidiplo.5.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, but they have not returned alone. Several officers have arrived in preparation for the shared training exercises, much to the delight of our government. Hopefully their advice will aid in raising the effectiveness of our military, and provide new insight into military doctrine that our officers may have neglected. Of course, we shall send over several of our own officers immediately, as agreed upon. It seems our relationship with the West Russian Revolutionary Front is beginning to bear fruit..."
 komidiplo.5.a:0 "...and may our relationship continue to bear fruit in the future."

 komidiplo.6.t:0 "The Front Declines"
 komidiplo.6.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, bearing a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Their government claims they can not spare the manpower to undergo shared training exercises, as they claim to require every officer they can get their hands on. Their government apologizes for their refusal, but claim their hands are tied, and such a request simply isn't feasible at this time."
 komidiplo.6.a:0 "Hopefully they may change their minds in the future..."

 komidiplo.7.t:0 "Komi Requests An Alliance"
 komidiplo.7.d:0 "Diplomats from Syktyvkar once again come to our government bearing a request. The Komi Republic requests a formal guarantee from our government, to last until the threat of reactionaries is purged from the immediate area. They wish to ensure the safety of their people, and believe our military could provide the defenses necessary to secure the Republic's position.\n\nSome within our government believe we can't afford to defend both Komi's territory and our own, and that we must decline such a request at this time. They also argue this deal does not sufficiently benefit our government, and that this relationship with Komi is an unequal one. Others within our government believe guaranteeing the Komi Republic's safety could allow us to gain a valuable and trusted ally, and that our military is large enough to spare the men and equipment for such a request."
 komidiplo.7.a:0 "A formal guarantee is in our best interests, tell them we shall protect each other."
 komidiplo.7.b:0 "We can not afford to defend them, they must secure their position themselves."

 komidiplo.8.t:0 "Mutual Protection"
 komidiplo.8.d:0 "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear good news. The West Russian Revolutionary Front has agreed to formally guarantee our government. This mutual protection guarantee will place our Republic in a much safer and stronger position. We are glad our allies are willing to cooperate to such an extent, and this partnership has once again proven its worth. In such turbulent times, it is comforting to know that we have such a dependable ally backing us."
 komidiplo.8.a:0 "We are now a truly united front!"

 komidiplo.9.t:0 "Alone Once More"
 komidiplo.9.d:0 "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear bad news. It appears the West Russian Revolutionary Front has refused our request for a formal guarantee of our safety. They claim to be unable to spare the manpower and equipment to defend us at the moment. Not only is our government disappointed by this decision, this decision has disappointed the people of our Republic. If the West Russian Revolutionary Front can't commit to defending their allies, then why ally with them at all? Maybe they will change their minds in the future, but as it stands relations with Arkhangelsk have taken a heavy blow."
 komidiplo.9.a:0 "Komi stands alone once more."

 komidiplo.11.t:0 "Komi's Request"
 komidiplo.11.d:0 "We have received a diplomatic mission from quite an unexpected state, and that is the socialist Komi Republic situated to our east. Ever since they managed to secure their rule over their own borders, the leftists that finally dominated politics in Syktyvkar have turned outwards, and now seek to expand in the rest of Russia. Of course, we are a hurdle to their expansion, but they have not immediately taken up their arms to invade.\n\nAn offer has been made, and that is for our two republics to merge into one. According to Komi's statements, unification could be achieved as we have common goals. Specifically, our commitment to republicanism has been highlighted, and in general it seems possible for the two governments to co-exist as one, or at least that is what Komi claims.\n\nDespite this, many of our own officials and generals are not so sure about this offer, seeing Komi as a second WRRF, and they do not wish to meddle with communism yet again. We need to make a choice, or else we will soon have none"
 komidiplo.11.a:0 "Agree to their deal."
 komidiplo.11.b:0 "Reject the offer, we do not support socialism."
 
 komidiplo.12.t:0 "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.12.d:0 "Vologda has finally endorsed socialism and its principles by joining the proud Komi Republic, after a short period of integration. After seeing the advantages we have to offer, and how successful we have been, it would be logical for any warlord regime to join us. And they, despite their suspected anti-communist sentiments seeing as they were a despotist military junta, have accepted. As of today, Vologda is both officially and practically under the control of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe army of the neutral zone has reluctantly declared its allegiance to our cause, although some small problems have occurred by those who do not want to see their lands under communist control. For the most part, the Vologdan government has shown this as the end of the neutrality, not because of force, but because a proper Russian government has been found, and so has managed to gain wide popular support in their move. Even if some are opposed to this, another warlord state has embraced communism."
 komidiplo.12.a:0 "A victory for the proletariat!"

 komidiplo.13.t:0 "Vologda Declines"
 komidiplo.13.d:0 "Even though some had voiced their concerns on the military government of Vologda and their possible reluctance to join us, we decided to take the chance and make an open offer, since we had nothing to lose. But it seems that, in the end, they were right. As they wish to maintain their neutrality, Vologda has explicitly refused to surrender to our communist regime. As such, war is our only option.\n\nWe must show no mercy in destroying the anti-communist junta to our west. Lacking the ability to field a large, powerful and well-supplied army, they will not be able to resist effectively, and aside from the insignificant resistance that might linger on led by those who are not loyal, they will be dealt with as a threat within a very short amount of time. At least, that's what the High Command claims. Thus, we can no longer delay the invasion of Vologda."
 komidiplo.13.a:0 "To arms, comrades!"

 komidiplo.17.t:0 "Komi Offers Integration"
 komidiplo.17.d:0 "The socialist state of Komi, believing we have much in common and share common beliefs and ideologies, has decided to peacefully approach us. Messengers from Syktyvkar relayed the offer the Republic has made, and that is the re-integration of Gorky and the army it possesses into their socialist state.\n\nThis offer, while it would end our sovereignty, could prove to be beneficial for us. First of all, we do in fact believe in the revolution as well, and as such Komi's ideology is aligned to our own. Additionally, we expect them to hold the same lust for vengeance as we do for the Germans, and we will continue operating our army within the greater frame of a powerful government that can protect us.\n\nHowever, many still hold reservations about joining Komi. Their reasons vary, from small differences in socialist doctrine, to the simple reluctance to simply give the precious city of Gorky away to someone else. Still, a final decision will have to be made."
 komidiplo.17.a:0 "Join with our socialist brothers!"
 komidiplo.17.b:0 "We cannot be annexed by them, reject the offer!"
 
 komidiplo.18.t:0 "Gorky Accepts Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.18.d:0 "This day marks a victory for socialism in West Russia, as Gorky has welcomed Komi's government with open arms. Seeing the similarities we share, and eager to see the motherland strong and reunited under a leftist government to fight the German menace, the military government agreed to unify with us.\n\nA joint military parade was organized in the streets of Gorky, outside of the massive tank factory. Thousands came to see it, and celebrate the unification of the two regimes, further demonstrating the popularity we have in the city. Furthermore, the city's army, well known for its use of armoured fighting vehicles to a great extent, has clearly demonstrated its loyalty to Komi, not only through the parade but through willingly joining with our own Red Army and beginning their integration into the High Command. Thankfully, we did not have to use bloodshed to bring Gorky under our control."
 komidiplo.18.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

 komidiplo.19.t:0 "Gorky Refuses Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.19.d:0 "Unfortunate news come from the frontier, specifically from Gorky. When we gave the government there an offer to unite with us and help in our struggle, we expected that they would understand the situation they are in. A powerful state built on socialism that is not the WRRF they once broke away from has risen in West Russia. Still believing in socialism and its doctrine, aside from their wish for vengeance against the invaders in the form of massive attacks, it would be logical for them to join us. Yet they didn't. They have declared us to be nothing but another breed of revisionists, and refuse to cooperate.\n\nThere is only one solution now, and it is war. As much as we hate to spill blood against fellow socialists, are they truly faithful in our ideology if they do not follow us? Thus, our war plan to invade Gorky shall be executed by the High Command as soon as possible, and they will easily crumble in front of the powerful Red Army we control."
 komidiplo.19.a:0 "Let's hope we succeed."

 komidiplo.20.t:0 "Komi Sends a Diplomatic Mission!"
 komidiplo.20.d:0 "In the chaotic environment our neutral zone resides in, diplomacy is rarely applied. It matters more if you can overpower the enemy's army than if you can convince them with words and promises. In spite of that common piece of wisdom in post-war Russia, the building that Vologda is governed from from received a surprising visitor today.\n\nThe visitor, dressed formally and serious-looking, explained to government officials of his intent, and that was to conduct diplomacy with Vologda on behalf of our eastern neighbors, the Komi Republic. Well known for its political turmoil between different factions forever locked in a power struggle, the Republic seems to have finally looked outwards and reach out for friends. In fact, the ambassador has mentioned specific terms that would be, at least according to him, beneficial for both our nations.\n\nThe Komi Republic has suggested the creation of a proper diplomatic channel between us and Syktyvkar, so that we can quickly discuss issue and reinforce our relationship. Additionally, even the possibility of an actual alliance between us and them has been strongly implied. The question is if we want to accept the offer to strengthen our relationship, or if we want to maintain our neutrality as we have done for so long."
 komidiplo.20.a:0 "We must accept. Good friends here are rare."
 komidiplo.20.b:0 "We must refuse. We can go on our own."

 komidiplo.21.t:0 "Vologda Accepts our Request!"
 komidiplo.21.d:0 "Great news come from the city of Vologda, across the frontier! Our diplomatic mission which we recently employed has enjoyed great success. It seems that the regime ruling the town is supportive of our efforts to create bilateral relations, and has welcomed the mission with open arms. Now, we can initiate trade of resources and arms for the benefit of both us and Vologda, as well as discuss our future steps, now that talks with them are not a rare occurrence but a possibility every day.\n\nWe must not forget that the goals of this diplomatic effort do not stop at minor trade deals and vaguely cordial relations. The optimal outcome would be for Komi and Vologda to enter into a full alliance, determined to protect themselves from the surrounding enemies that may appear. They may be socialists, monarchists or fascists, but no matter what the two states will have to band together to fight them off. Of course, if we gain enough diplomatic sway, we could even use this to our advantage in expanding. But for now, our ambassador is doing an excellent work at cooperating with the authorities and gaining their trust."
 komidiplo.21.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 komidiplo.22.t:0 "Vologda Refuses Us!"
 komidiplo.22.d:0 "Unfortunately for us, news from the recent diplomatic mission to the western warlord of Vologda are not positive. The mission, despite the offers it made, and the advantages the alliance with the Komi Republic would bring, failed to gather the support of the regime. While we are not certain what exactly made Vologda refuse the offer, and whether it was due to a specific term or their isolationist tendencies, the end result is the same. The possibility of a mutual alliance against aggression and for the prosperity of democracy in Russia has ended with this failure. Let us not be discouraged by this failure, though; there are bigger fish to fry and we have many other options."
 komidiplo.22.a:0 "Vologda will stand on its own."

 komidiplo.23.t:0 "A Gift from the Republic"
 komidiplo.23.d:0 "We received a message from the Komi Republic this morning, something that becomes more frequent as we strengthen our alliance. It was reported that major industrial experts and economists from our eastern neighbor have closely cooperated in order to create a program for financial aid to Vologda, something we greatly appreciate.\n\nThe "aid pack", as it has come to be commonly referred to by our officials, includes a substantial amount of funds, dedicated to supporting our economy, as well as boosting developing industries, and even some equipment and blueprints. Komi has trusted us to use this for a good cause, and this has helped our mutual friendship. To truly show our appreciation and respect for this gift, we must reply in kind, sending our own aid to the Republic, in funds as well as investments in their industries. Hopefully this will show them how trustworthy their allies are."
 komidiplo.23.a:0 "Let's send them our own aid."

 komidiplo.24.t:0 "Freedom of Movement"
 komidiplo.24.d:0 "As the bonds between us and the Komi Republic continue to strengthen, the government in Syktyvkar has decided to be even more open to us, both figuratively and literally. Yesterday, our diplomatic office in Komi was informed that the frontier between Vologda and them is now open.\n\nGarrison soldiers, wandering merchants and even normal civilians were surprised to see the unofficial demarcation line become effectively a free border. Once fiercely guarded by military troops, anyone who wanted to cross it would have to go through an extensive search by the guards before going to the other side, not to mention the endless other dangers. But now, many breathe a sigh of relief, from traders to separated families, as travel in the region becomes easier.\n\nBeyond the practicality of this act, this is a show of good faith by the Komi Republic, proving our good relations have beared fruit. Of course, to show our appreciation for this, we will need to loosen our control on the frontier as well, by decreasing our forces on the border and gradually ending the control and surveillance over who crosses it."
 komidiplo.24.a:0 "Open the borders."

 komidiplo.25.t:0 "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.25.d:0 "To the east of us, a Republic has held control for years since the West Russian War. Some time ago, Komi was considered nothing more than a safe haven for radicals, destined to fall on one extreme of the political spectrum and become yet another threat to our survival, as if Germany and the WRRF were not enough. But it seems that, in the end, democracy prevailed. Not only that, but our former rivals in West Russia have been neutralized by this movement. And now, as Komi continues to assert its control over the region, we stand in its way.\n\nHowever, they have not taken the approach of war and conquest, as seems to be common here, but of negotiations. Specifically, seeing Vologda's commitment to democracy, at least to some extent, and our wish to see the motherland reunited under a better regime, Komi proposed we merge our governments. Both administrations will join to become one, and theoretically, it will be an equal unification, not an annexation. Promises have been made that many of those who govern the city of Vologda now will continue to do so in the future, under the protection of a strong democratic government. Additionally, the messages we have received seem to strongly imply that, should we refuse to accept the offer, since we will be considered enemies of democracy and the nation, violent action will have to be taken by Komi against Vologda..."
 komidiplo.25.a:0 "Clearly, Komi is unable to communicate their true intentions."
 komidiplo.25.b:0 "Accept the offer, for a democratic Russia!"

 komidiplo.26.t:0 "Vologda Declines!"
 komidiplo.26.d:0 "Unbelievably enough, the neutral zone of Vologda has refused to bow down to our authority! In a move of treason against the nation, and defying the wishes of the people for the rule of a strong and democratic government, the military junta governing the city to our west flat out declined the offer for merging the two regimes, stating that they wish to continue enjoying their freedom and their rights as a neutral zone that will not acknowledge any warlord's authority.\n\nWe have already begun our preparations for what is now inevitable, an armed expedition into Vologda. The diplomats have departed the city and returned to Syktyvkar, ending all communications with the neutral zone. Meanwhile, the High Command is finalizing the details of Plan Blue, the codename for the invasion. It will not take long before we are ready for war against the weak regime to our west."
 komidiplo.26.a:0 "This is what happens to traitors."

 komidiplo.27.t:0 "Vologda Votes to Join Komi!"
 komidiplo.27.d:0 "Celebrate, citizens of Komi! Today, Vologda joins our republic!\n\nThe offer for merging the administrations has been welcomed by the semi-authoritarian government in Vologda. It seems they still believe in democracy, and as such they quickly answered our request with a positive response. Quickly, the two militaries ended all limitations to travel between their respective territory, and are working to tear down any border fences or checkpoints. The soldiers near the border have come together, celebrating the unification and meeting their Russian brothers that are no longer enemies on the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from the military regime we have recently united with have arrived in Syktyvkar, outlining the exact plans and process for the proper integration of their lands into the Republic. In the streets of both our own capital and Vologda, the citizens cheer on our government, and the flag of our nation is waved proudly across our domain."
 komidiplo.27.a:0 "This is truly a day of joy."

 komidiplo.28.t:0 "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.28.d:0 "We have received a curious message today. Diplomats from the so-called Komi Republic, which now borders our free state, have sent us an offer that is not to be taken lightly. They are requesting that Tatarstan join with them as an autonomous Tatar republic. Should we accept their offer, we will retain a good deal of our autonomy and will no doubt be granted a say in their government. However, our days as an independent and sovereign nation will officially be over. If we deny their request, on the other hand, there is no telling how they will react. They may opt for a more direct approach to our annexation..."
 komidiplo.28.a:0 "Our independence is not up for debate!"
 komidiplo.28.b:0 "It is for the best that we join them."

 komidiplo.29.t:0 "Tatarstan Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.29.d:0 "Bad news from our diplomats in Tatarstan. Their arrogant government has outright refused our well-intentioned annexation proposal, and have strongly insisted upon their status as an independent state! Now that we have no other option to settle this matter peacefully, it may be time to activate Plan Violet after all. Forces are to be mobilized to their borders and begin preparing for offensive operations at once. Although the Tatars are known for their ferocity in battle, they are hopelessly outgunned and cannot hold out against our forces for long. Once the dust has settled, a period of occupation will begin to ensure the annexation process goes smoothly."
 komidiplo.29.a:0 "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this."

 komidiplo.30.t:0 "Tatarstan Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.30.d:0 "Good news from our diplomats in Tatarstan! The Tatars have agreed to our generous offer of annexation, and have reached out to us to formalize their integration into our republic. Their little nation, including their politicians and armed forces, are expected to join the fold shortly. An autonomous Tatar republic will soon be established within our borders, but most importantly we have managed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed despite these turbulent times."
 komidiplo.30.a:0 "Diplomacy has won the day!"

 komidiplo.31.t:0 "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.31.d:0 "Ever since the forces of the Komi Republic had arrived at our borders, it was only a matter of time before they would attempt diplomatic overtures. That day has finally arrived, and diplomats representing Komi come bearing an offer that we would do well to consider. They are offering us a great deal of autonomy under their protection, as well as a place in their democratic political systems. Most importantly, however, is that they are guaranteeing full religious freedom for the people of Bashkiria.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a generous offer, but is it worth giving up our hard-won independence for? If we were to decline, it is possible that further offers will be considerably less generous, and made from the barrel of a gun...\n\nWhat will our answer be?"
 komidiplo.31.a:0 "Their proposal is generous, we will accept."
 komidiplo.31.b:0 "No, they are not to be trusted!"
 
 komidiplo.32.t:0 "Bashkiria Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.32.d:0 "Troubling news from Bashkiria. It seems our diplomats have come home empty-handed, and the Bashkirs have reaffirmed their wishes to remain an independent islamic republic. Despite making a generous offer in good faith, it seems as though it was not enough to satisfy the fiercely zealous Bashkirs. We have no choice but to fall back to Plan Yellow.\n\nThis simple, robust strategy emphasizes eliminating any hostile Bashkir forces as quickly as possible, and includes plans for a temporary occupation government once offensive actions have ceased. Their army, although zealous and well-motivated, is outclassed by a considerable margin and the invasion is not expected to last very long."
 komidiplo.32.a:0 "They leave us no choice."

 komidiplo.33.t:0 "Bashkiria Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.33.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Bashkiria, and they bring with them promising news! The Bashkirs have agreed to our terms and now wish to discuss the finer details of their integration. This process is not expected to take long, and soon they will be integrated into our nation as an autonomous Bashkir republic with full religious rights guaranteed. On top of all this, their citizens will be given an equal say in our democratic processes. With this agreement in place, we have successfully expanded our influence into this region without firing a shot."
 komidiplo.33.a:0 "The pen is mightier than the sword."

 komidiplo.34.t:0 "An Anti-Bolshevik Pact?"
 komidiplo.34.d:0 "Ever since the West Russian War ended in a humiliating defeat for the cowardly forces of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, a specific status quo was established in the region, one that most soon came familiar with. Of course, there have been times where it has been shaken up, but for the most part, it has remained the same. For us, a pocket of Tsarism surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, it is crucial to use this state of things to our advantage, and the political developments in the Komi Republic have certainly helped with that.\n\nEver since the domination of the right-wing, nationalist forces in Syktyvkar, the diplomatic office of Vyatka has wondered if something could be done to make use of this political group in power. However, it now seems that they have decided to make the first move. We have just received a telegram from the republic to the north, in which they ask regarding the prospects of a mutual alliance against our common enemy, the WRRF.\n\nOur diplomats have quickly analyzed the situation that such an agreement could bring to West Russia. Of course, the nationalists of Komi are ideologically aligned, for the most part, to us, and could provide a shield against the strong communist forces threatening us from the north. Effectively, they could become our buffer state. In the end, what will our response be? Will we accept this proposal for a pact against our ideological enemies, or abandon the people who still do not bow under the Tsar's authority?"
 komidiplo.34.a:0 "Together, we are stronger."
 komidiplo.34.b:0 "Our road is ours to tread."

 komidiplo.35.t:0 "Vyatka Agrees to Cooperate"
 komidiplo.35.d:0 "Today, the forces of anti-Bolshevism make a great step in defeating even the last pocket of red in the free Russian territories. The message we have sent to the warlord state of Vyatka, vaguely aligned with our ideological goals, has received a positive reply. Likely coming to the realization that we are one of their few hopes for survival and flourishing in the region, they have been quick to voice their agreement for a mutual assistance pact.\n\nThe developments from the moment the reply was received have been surprisingly rapid. The minister of foreign affairs for our republic and their counterpart in Vyatka have come into contact, and are now in the process of scheduling the meeting in which the alliance will be officially signed. However, as often happens with these backdoor diplomatic arrangements, many of the points of the alliance have already been discussed behind the scenes.\n\nThe deal will include a promise that, should one signatory be attacked, the other will have to abide by the treaty and come to the aid of their ally. Limited military presence in the form of advisors and attachés will also likely be a term. Finally, a number of economic and military support between the two nations is more than likely to be included. From now on, Vyatka fiercely stands by us as our great ally."
 komidiplo.35.a:0 "Good to see we finally have some friends."

 komidiplo.36.t:0 "Vyatka Refuses our Offer"
 komidiplo.36.d:0 "When the telegram looking into the possibilities of an alliance with the monarchists to our south was sent to Vyatka, we expected that Tsar Vladimir would see how much we have in common, and how dire our situation is against numerous enemies. However, from what we can gather from the reply hastily sent by their own foreign office, the minute differences in our ideologies have been enough for them to reject the offer for an alliance, or at least justify doing so.\n\nOf course, we have been limited to our beliefs of the greatness of the Russian nation and its people, as well as their will to oppose the communists, the Germans, and all other enemies. We chose not to blindly follow the ideals of monarchism, that only appealed to the elite of the elite, and ignored the true will of the people of all classes. Despite the doubts by very few of the right's members, perhaps we were absolutely right in doing so.\n\nAny diplomatic channels and backdoors between Ust-Sysolsk and Vyatka that remained open have been closed in the aftermath of what is perceived as a diplomatic betrayal, especially when the WRRF looms over us ominously. For all intents and purposes, all prospects of befriending the Tsarists have ended. From now on, the only diplomatic interaction we will ever have again will be their instrument of surrender when war inevitably comes between us and them."
 komidiplo.36.a:0 "Much more dangerous threats exist right now."

 komidiplo.55.t:0 "The West Russian United Front?"
 komidiplo.55.d:0 "The theorists of the Komi Republic are its most solid fixture. For every ideological belief with traction, it seems there are a half-dozen men and women struggling to explain away the contradictions and analytical diversity of their chosen bloody hill of ideology. In fact, the sheer factionalism of every missive that comes out of the Republic is one of the reasons for the WRRF's hesitance in initiating official diplomatic ties in the wake of the Socialist change in leadership. It would simply be bad praxis to disrupt a situation that can charitably be described as, ah, dynamic.\n\nWhich is why it comes as a surprise to the men and women gathered in the United Front's Arkhangelsk Central Party Headquarters when the letter from Komi comes co-signed by half the factions in its Communist Party. It appears the cats have herded themselves, as a General dryly comments, into the fold.\n\nThe letter proposes, in a burst of rhetoric that is so ideologically packed it is unreadable in portions, a merger of interests. The Revolutionary Front has dedicated itself to military protection of the Socialist ideal. The Republic has spent much time and energy on developing the theoretical depth of Russian Socialism. A merger of the two, with the Komi Republic leading administrative affairs and the Arkhangelsk government transitioning to a proper military role, would surely be preferable to the mutual vulnerability of an arms' length relationship.\n\nIt is a tempting offer, but there is one major flaw to the plan that the letter has not spelled out: the Arkhangelsk government is not particularly trusting of the functionaries of a Republic that has never known the struggles of the North. Only the realisation that this alliance could give the Red Army an inroad into the South and West gives the proposal leeway in the debate - and even then, it is a matter of balanced odds, not inevitability."

 komidiplo.58.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.58.d:0 "Over the past few weeks, our scouts have observed an increase of military activity on our borders with the state known as "Ust-Sysolsk"; a highly militaristic, far-right regime based in the lands formerly owned by the Komi Republic. The belligerent attitude this regime has held towards their neighbors has been cause for concern, and now it seems they are turning our sights towards our holy order.\n\nA message has been received this morning demanding our immediate submission. Should we accept, they would peacefully integrate our order into Ust-Sysolsk and bloodshed would be avoided at the expense of our own freedom. On the other hand, should we decline, it seems clear they would not shy away from military action..."
 komidiplo.58.a:0 "We have no choice but to submit."
 komidiplo.58.b:0 "These heretics do not deserve our fear!"

 komidiplo.59.t:0 "The Order Submits!"
 komidiplo.59.d:0 "As expected, the Order of Saint George has wilted in the face of our military might and decided it would be best to submit rather than risk a military confrontation. Our troops are already moving across the border into Gayny to ensure the integration process goes smoothly and without incident."
 komidiplo.59.a:0 "One more step on the road to unification."

 komidiplo.60.t:0 "The Order Stands Defiant!"
 komidiplo.60.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the Order of Saint George has refused our demands and stands defiant even in the face of our overwhelming martial superiority. They are already reinforcing their borders and preparing for the inevitable conflict, but this effort is almost certainly futile. Our forces outnumber theirs by a considerable margin, and this war is not likely to take long."
 komidiplo.60.a:0 "Brave, but foolish."

 komidiplo.61.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.61.d:0 "Trouble on the horizon. The far-right regime based in Syktyvkar has long been a source of concern for us, and it seems their attention has finally been drawn to our neutral zone. Large forces of troops are massing on the border, and this worrying turn of events has coincided with a message to our foreign office.\n\nThe so-called state of "Ust-Sysolsk" demands the neutral zone's immediate submission and integration into their borders. Should we refuse, they have vaguely implied some kind of military action. Judging by the large presence of troops on our border, this threat is hardly a bluff. Shall we surrender and put the final nail in the neutral zone's coffin, or attempt to defend ourselves?"
 komidiplo.61.a:0 "We cannot possibly win. We must submit."
 komidiplo.61.b:0 "The neutral zone cannot fall!"
 
 komidiplo.62.t:0 "Vologda Submits!"
 komidiplo.62.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the neutral government of Vologda has wisely decided to submit to our demands rather than subject their lands to the ravages of war. We shall begin the process of integration immediately, and our soldiers have already crossed the border to ensure our rule is solidified. "
 komidiplo.62.a:0 "Neutrality is overrated."

 komidiplo.63.t:0 "Vologda Refuses to Submit!"
 komidiplo.63.d:0 "The neutral zone of Vologda has, bafflingly, decided to defy our demands and refuse integration! They clearly do not understand that the odds are against them, and would rather risk a military confrontation than give up their misguided independence. Their army is woefully inferior compared to ours, and isn't expected to put up much resistance."
 komidiplo.63.a:0 "We will crush them!"

 komidiplo.64.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Breaks off Ties"
 komidiplo.64.d:0 "Worrying news from our supposed "allies" of Ust-Sysolsk. The government in Syktyvkar has decided, in defiance of any rational explanation, to nullify their treaty of mutual assistance with the Empire.\n\nWe can only guess why they've done this, but it is almost certainly because they desire our lands. Our scouts already report concerning troop movements across our borders, so we must be prepared for anything. If Ust-Sysolsk truly is planning to attack, we cannot afford to be caught off-guard."
 komidiplo.64.a:0 "We never should've trusted them!"

 komidiplo.65.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.65.d:0 "A message has been received from the neighboring statelet of Ust-Sysolsk, demanding in no uncertain terms for all our forces to stand down. This is hardly a bold-faced bluff on their part, as their armies have already mobilized to our borders in the event of our refusal.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation indeed. Should we surrender, there's no telling what will become of our soldiers, who have engaged in acts of banditry across the entire region. On the other hand, remaining defiant could result in far more death than if we were to just surrender..."
 komidiplo.65.a:0 "Perhaps it is time to lay down our arms..."
 komidiplo.65.b:0 "We shall crush them beneath our treads!"

 komidiplo.66.t:0 "Gorky Surrenders!"
 komidiplo.66.d:0 "The bandit brigades of Gorky have wisely decided to surrender to our forces, no doubt coming to the conclusion that a conflict would result in their total destruction. Our troops have secured control over Gorky and its important mechanized factories without so much as a shot fired, and the integration of the region proceeds as planned."
 komidiplo.66.a:0 "How fortuitous."

 komidiplo.67.t:0 "Gorky Refuses!"
 komidiplo.67.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the bandits of Gorky stand defiant in the face of our demands and are preparing to do battle with our forces. Despite having them outnumbered, the bandits' vast fleet of tanks may prove to be a challenging obstacle indeed. That being said, they cannot hope to hold out against our comparatively vast army for too long."
 komidiplo.67.a:0 "Those rusty tin cans do not scare us!"

 komidiplo.68.t:0 "A Letter to Tartarstan"
 komidiplo.68.d:0 "Our relations with the West Russian states that we reluctantly call our neighbors are limited, at best. In truth, the Tartarstan Republic finds little need for a world that has mostly abandoned it, and as our economy and workforce face the problems inherent to a newborn state, even that is steadily decreasing in importance. For the most part, we are alone, and we would be happy to stay that way.\n\nIt appears this isolation has now been forcibly ended.\n\nThe letter from the new leader of the Republic to our north has more to it than a mere notice of name-change: its new leader, Gumilyov, speaks to a union of flesh and steel that he envisions will one day stretch across the long band of the Urals. It is, in his defence, a very well-argued concept, even if it sounds like the babblings of a madman, and some on our soil have been noticeably swayed by the Pan-Eurasian siren. It does not help that the letter promises religious pluralism and respect for our ancient creed; our men are warriors of faith as well as champions of industry, and Gumilyov's promises of a minimal degree of respect are inherently appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, these promises inevitably come at a cost. Gumilyov calls for our righteous submission, and as he phrases it, "much will come of our work together - our place is one of humble leadership, and yours of loyal and righteous service". These are controversial words, and the best we can say about them is that they are not quite as bad as what we would expect from your average Russian Alexander-to-be."
 komidiplo.68.a:0 "God Willing, may our union bring glory to us both."
 komidiplo.68.b:0 "Rebuff these fools. Their words mean little."

 komidiplo.69.t:0 "The Instrument of Accession"
 komidiplo.69.d:0 "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nThe Accession Instrument is simple: in exchange for privileged treatment as an ethnic minority following a noble creed, the Tatars shall swear political allegiance to us and fold their own government into ours. The Tatar economy shall also take marching orders from our own leadership, although it is in truth more difficult to constrain their thriving caravan economy than it would be to herd cats.\n\nOur Leader has expressed good cheer at this news, and he has issued a Pan-Eurasian call to unity to be read in the new territory's mosques. Surely the noble Moslems of the region will greet their new brothers with open arms..."
 komidiplo.69.a:0 "Glory to our brothers from Tatarstan!"

 komidiplo.70.t:0 "A Temporary Resistance"
 komidiplo.70.d:0 "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nUnfortunately, there have been complications in enlightening the Tatars as to the obvious benefits to their accession. We have received a stiffly-worded refusal in exchange, citing only "natural political and cultural concerns" as their primary reasons. Pah! The Teacher's embrace is all the political and cultural incentive these misguided Muhammedans could ever desire, and it is to their detriment that they are blind to our compassions.\n\nNo matter - the refusal is purely a temporary matter. Our divisions are preparing to bring the inevitability of Eurasian rebirth to Tatar soil. Let the grasses weep; we will join soil with soil regardless."
 komidiplo.70.a:0 "They will come to regret this."

 komidiplo.71.t:0 "Gumilyov's Invitation"
 komidiplo.71.d:0 "The land of Komi has been atumble with political intrigue for as long as can be remembered: now, however, something entirely new has emerged from the chaos, and the new leadership has set its sights on us. Their leader, Gumilyov, professes a strange creed proclaiming unity with all brothers and sisters of the land, and they have even sent us a strange advertisement proclaiming a common "base of faith, tolerance and ardor" - our imams are confused, to say the least, but they appreciate the proposal.\n\nQuestions of religious tolerance aside, we do not possess any illusions as to the true nature of their proposal. Gumilyov claims that our men and armaments will be subsumed into a larger cause, one that aims to bring unity to the steppes. What he conveniently neglects to mention is that this endeavour will require colossal amounts of bloodshed; much of it, no doubt, our own.\n\nSome on our soil, however, have found his beliefs persuasive: just the other day we had to lock up an itinerant preacher with some strange ideas about this Eurasianism, and a domestic crowd rallies to the defense of a Russia we thought dead decades ago. Opposing them is most of our domestic political establishment, the latter of whom believe Gumilyov's strange ideas regarding the Rus are merely proof that Ust-Sysolsk truly is a land for madmen.\n\nWell, madmen or not, we must decide. Unity or independence? Peace or war?"
 komidiplo.71.a:0 "Let us go with Gumilyov."
 komidiplo.72.b:0 "We stand alone!"
 
 komidiplo.72.t:0 "The Integration of Bashkiria"
 komidiplo.72.d:0 "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nUfa is festooned with the banners of Eurasia today, bearing witness to the arrival of the Teacher Gumilyov - in his first public address to the new province, Gumilyov read verses from the Koran and promised to uphold a "staunch brotherhood and mutual respect" between all peoples. This was met with cheers from a mostly amused crowd, although a few upstart imams have also been arrested for trying to cause trouble. We are certain that the troublesome talk of resistance some of these incendiaries have seeded in the population will take some time to weed out as well...\n\nWell, it is not all bad news. The religious and political establishment of Ufa have already sworn allegiance to their new superiors, and the principles of Eurasian Fraternity have been successfully rolled out in the provincial education system. Military recruitment is also progressing as well as can be hoped, although the existing officer corps is taking longer than usual to accommodate our new oaths. Perhaps a visit from State Security is in order?\n\nWell, that is all I can report from Ufa this week. We congratulate the Teacher on his success - may Eurasia be reborn from the blood and resolve of our brothers!"
 komidiplo.72.a:0 "Glory to Gumilyov!"
 
 komidiplo.73.t:0 "Stubborn Fools!"
 komidiplo.73.d:0 "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nWe recognize now that our efforts to promote brotherhood and common cause between us and these damnable Bashkirians were doomed from the start; is it some peculiar fault of the constitution that engenders a lack of common sense? Is it a failed education system that causes the blindness of its leadership? Either way, the result is clear: Bashkiria has rejected our proposal for unity, and they have even gone so far as to expel our Consulate with your most humble servant included! What an insult to the Eurasian ideal, and to the Teacher himself!\n\nWe have succeeded in drawing perhaps a few hundred to the fold, and some have promised to leave this misguided land altogether to join the Leader, but there is little hope that this quasi-state will ever be persuaded to join us peacefully. Some of their most notable imams have thrown us a statement outright denying our tolerance and calling us the "spittle of Satan", in fact. Insults aside, we should not anticipate a peaceful occupation should we decide to militarily intervene.\n\nWe must prepare for the worst: eventually they will come to accept that our rule is a benevolent one, no matter how much blood is spent on their conviction."
 komidiplo.73.a:0 "Mere delays to the inevitable."

 komidiplo.74.t:0 "A Threat to Berezniki"
 komidiplo.74.d:0 "Kazembek's watching the guard escort the Eternal Loyalty convoy to the gates when the message comes. The sky is foggy and the wind gnaws at everything, such that the messenger's words are almost lost in the whirl:\n\n"Ust-Sytolsk wants our terms, Sir!"\n\nThere is little doubt what he means: Vyatka's active government has long warned of such a possibility. Ust-Sytolsk is run by an insane demagogue who demands the blood of his countrymen to spill in rivers for his deluded fantasy of Eurasianism, but it was believed his madness would gutter out long before he became a threat. Instead, his armies are here and an imminent threat.\n\nKazembek's meeting with his little cabinet is brief. All other options are denied them; Gumilyov demands submission or war, and there is no room for negotiation. Nor will this fight be anything but a fait accompli for the limited military strength of the statelet: they cannot hope to sustain more than a relentless retreat or a single, hopeless stand.\n\nThere is one last choice to be made, and no dignity in either option. Kazembek sighs, like something being released from his spirit, and chooses."
 komidiplo.74.a:0 "Submission."
 komidiplo.74.b:0 "War."
 
 komidiplo.75.t:0 "A Resignation"
 komidiplo.75.d:0 "Berezniki's choice is clear when the morning comes: the border garrison notes mass surrenders of border troops and a rapid breakdown of anything resembling coherent resistance. As the armies march into the statelet, they encounter a mostly subdued scene: thugs running People's Battalions pushing prisoners forth stop patrols and offer their charges to soldiers before running away, and villages offer only temporary rest and aid before shooing confused officers away.\n\nThe leadership having surrendered, its administrative apparatus begins the slow process of moving towards Gumilyov's own government, and there it receives a rude awakening. Civil servants and democratic dissenters trade homes and offices for the prison-camps, and there is nothing resembling fair trials for the intelligentsia already under arrest by the previous regime. Instead, for a select few who have earned the wrath of the Eurasianists, there is a bullet in the dead of night as the sum total of mercy offered.\n\nBerezniki dies with these quick arrests - the rest offer submission, and Gumilyov's regime is quick to begin the next step of ensuring loyalty. Young men are rounded up in squares and markets, the perennial harvest of all states, and offered the choice:"
 komidiplo.75.a:0 "Serve Eurasia or die for yourself."
 
 komidiplo.76.t:0 "A Simple Refusal"
 komidiplo.76.d:0 "Berezniki makes its stance clear in the dead of night: the envoy from Ust-Systolsk is expelled and his guard unceremoniously shot as a warning, and as he is taken back to the border by People's Battalions he records the following:\n\n"Watching a convulsion of violence erupt, from the safety of my truck: here and there bonfires and shouts, and I hear screams from the grasslands. They are rooting out sympathisers, some real, many imagined, and they intend to sear it out of them."\n\n"We are passing by the ruins of a village. The smell is fresh, acrid. Greasy. I ask: what happened to these people? The guard snorts and turns away, saying only: they opposed the People's Tsar."\n\n"For the first time since coming, I can no longer trust the honor of the Mladorossi. It is now apparent they are violent, angry people, and they cannot be trusted in peace any more than they can be offered mercy in war."\n\nThe report has been met by accusations of bias and outright fabrication by their own representative in our regime, but he has been expelled from the country as well: there will be no room to rebut this, and it does make a convenient narrative to rally around."
 komidiplo.76.a:0 "I'm not sure whether to believe this."

We had, all of us, nursed doubts as to the ideological consistency of men whose guns seemed so often to outweigh their convictions. Why did the Revolutionary Frontists choose to give their senior Generals, with unclear connections to their Politburo, fiefdoms that were autonomous from their main territory? How could the Revolutionary Front's civilian policy not consider the role of autonomous, Socialist Party organs in developing ideological devotion in the local Proletariat?\n\nWe now know that the Clique - those red-painted jackals in waiting! - were not conflicted over their bizarre attempts at imposing Socialism at gunpoint. In all truthfulness, this author doubts if the Revolutionary Front was ever truly committed to Socialism at all, other than as a way to further the cause of their bourgeois crypto-nationalism. All illusions must henceforth be dispelled, all hopes released, all expectations destroyed. The truth is that Arkangelsk, far from being our salvation, has turned out to be yet another rightist, deviationist gang of armed men devoted only to perverting the Revolution into their twisted, violent image.\n\nIf there is anything to be learnt from this state of affairs, it is our renewed understanding that only a commitment to the Party Line can ensure true loyalty to the Revolution. Just think! Had it not been for the Party of the Republic, we would have been as prone as any other people in Russia to the disease that is warlordism. We thank Arkhangelsk for this, and only this - because of their stubbornness, we have been inoculated from this disease once and for all."

We look to the World with expectant eyes, and to the rest of our Motherland - if the Generals of the Front hope to find in us the ideological strength and the collective will to undo the Undoing of the Nation, they can rest assured that they will find us more than sufficient.\n\nWe must not rest on our laurels, however. The time has come to use the massive armaments Arkhangelsk has gathered - the warlords around our scattered domains are restless. They see the march of history in their eyes. The time is coming when they will attempt to stop it.\n\nWe must simply beat them to the punch. Let us not be afraid of the future, comrades. The triumph was long delayed, but it, like the World Revolution, like the spinning of the world itself, will come one day.

 komi_socdem.1.d:0 "Rodionov gazed at the hulking shell of the factory, lost as ever in thought. He was not a particularly expressive man, but occasionally he afforded his mind the luxury of imagination as a dog might be afforded a leash on a warm day. It wasn't like he didn't have the time, anyway - [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] had sent him here, on this "fact-finding mission", to scout out something he could present the Republic with shiny fetters and trimmed ribbons on the sides.\n\nHe shrugged. It was time to take his imagination for a walk.\n\nThe name of the factory had long been lost, and what appeared to have been a bomb-blast had sharded most of the walls in the east wing. Even so, there was plenty of evidence remaining to suggest that this place had once been a hive of activity: here and there the familiar white-scrabble of concrete and steel loomed in the building's innards, surrounded by brilliant rust-red rings of dust. Streaks of rust and scraped-off concrete indicated the presence of what must have been lights, equipment, presses and hydraulic wires.\n\nHow long had it been since the walls had hummed with activity, as they no doubt once had? When had the lights gone out, and how many had whiled away their youth playing soldier amidst the ruins? Rodionov thought to the interviews he'd held with the townsfolk in the little village to the left. So few of them left, and so many empty houses. Gone with the money, or its lack, and the hope leached from their faces like a blanket sodden too long in bleach. The years had been bleak to old Russia, and the wind harsh - and who could tell if it would continue?\n\nHis feet crunched on something, and he raised his boot away, squinting. Thick-woven cotton, a few buttons, a face and body and little cloth-knotted arms, and on the face a little smile - a child's doll, here in the ruins of Russian industry. If that wasn't symbolic, he didn't know what was."

Truth be told, that was probably the only reason why it got as far as his door in the first place - the DSNP had gotten past its worst day, but a residue of suspicion seemed to taint everything past the office doors these days. Even so, once the letter made it to [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] there was little to do but apologise. It was an intrusion, after all, and no doubt the President would simply laugh it off or spend another afternoon on the phone, fulminating to Zhdanov or whoever had caught the man's eye these days.\n\nThe staffer unfortunate enough to chance upon [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] later in the afternoon caught him at his worst: passionate, fiery, with a trace of the old vigor - dangerous in the way a lit match threatens the hand. [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] seized the staffer by the arms, calling at once a staff meeting to address the miners' deplorable safety conditions and their degraded working hours. The meeting lasted five hours, and their response-plan five more: the rays of dawn heralded the end of the latter.\n\nThe President, however, was bound by no such petty rules as the need to sleep. By dawn he had chauffeured a handy staff-car, dragging his aides along to "speak" directly with the management of that little mine southwest of Syktyvkar, and whatever he told the Company men, it worked. The headlines blared the President's name and a handy little picture of a smiling [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] held aloft by exultant sweaty men for a week straight, declaring him a MAN OF THE PEOPLE and a PROGRESSIVE ICON.\n\nTo the exhausted Staffers planning his celebratory campaign, half-dead from overwork and on unpaid overtime, it almost seemed worth the trouble."

"Alexei, I believe we have certain concerns your Union has failed to address - I am not a man enamoured of warding off the inevitable, so let us try again. Will you, or will you not, stand for a work-week reduction?"\n\nThe Unionist sighed, trotting out the same words he'd always trotted out to the faux-benevolent. "With all due respect, Mr. President, you simply don't understand the material conditions here. We are already treading on the ragged edge of our employers, and it would not do to anger -"\n\nAll at once [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] was animated, almost snarling. Alexei reeled at the sight. "And there it is! How dare you comport yourself like a union man while you bow and scrape before your employers! What a travesty to the spirit of Unionism, and an insult to the ideals of our Nation!" Was it just him, or was there a gleam of triumph in the President's eyes? Was this sport to him?\n\nAs the men gathered around him clapped and jeered, Alexei covered his face with his hands. He'd lost the union's heart, and who knew if his successor would resist crumbling before the demands of the people? Or if the Company wouldn't expel them from the factory altogether?

Presently a staffer, dressed in formal slacks, put on a painfully plastic smile and clapped for attention. "Gentlemen, I welcome you to the first meeting of the Komi Republic Electoral Committee. Please, let us go around the table and say a little about where we come from and what we do."\n\nAs Korolkov listened, his face grew ever more set, and his heart chilled. He'd learned from young to tell when someone was speaking about something they didn't believe. Their eyes never met yours, or their words were oddly stilted or lilting. Something about the human voice was a consummate betrayer of intent. Every one of the members of the table had a voice that betrayed him. Their gazes were false, and when they spoke of the enthusiasm they shared for the Electoral Commission red flags began to appear before Korolkov's own mental gaze.\n\nKorolkov kept his voice level as he rose to speak, but on a sudden tide of conviction he decided to probe a little. "Gentlemen, I believe that we have only breached the surface, as it were.

We don't need to pretend at fairness, and we won't. Democracy is when [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] wants things done, right?"\n\nThe man leaned close, almost predatory in his sudden smile.

"Can anyone tell me what Democracy is?" Komorova's voice is stern and gentle in a fashion only seasoned educators can pull off. For once, the class is not silent before her gaze. One boy - Pavlovich, with the curly hair - raises his hand tentatively. She nods to him. "Yes, Pavlovich."\n\n"Demok - democracy is when people choose what they want to happen! Like when Dad and Mom choose between me and my brother to help at the shop!" Komorova nods approvingly. "That's right, Pavlovich. Very good. Democracy is when we choose the important things - not just who does the weekly chores, but also our leaders, what we dream about for our country. Our futures."\n\n"And Socialism is when the Government does things!" A voice rings from the back of the class, jubilant in its confidence. Dana. "My father says Shofarevich is right and that the - "\n\n"Your father is wrong, Dana. Socialism is a lot like when we divide apples at lunch. We give extra to those who might have less to eat, and when people can give extra slices from their own share we distribute those too. Because it's fair."\n\nKomorova smiles wanly. "We must get it right, children. Remember these things when you come of age, and be wise in your choices. Because this is who we're doing it for - " She raps the last word on the board. RUSSIA."

The network of donations must stop at once - we will repent of illegal campaign financing and donate existing liquid assets to charitable causes. Well, that is how we will present it - in truth, this is a little like wiping your own arse after we have already flushed, yes? (laughter, extended) Quieten down, friends! You have heard my humor for a decade, should you now stoop to pretending that I am actually funny?\n\nIn any case, the payments must stop, and the robes that those payments bought must be shed with their loss. No more flaunting, comrades - the expensive cars, the wristwatches, all must go back into the bag. We are to maintain decorum for a little while, and we must humble ourselves to walking with the common man. Unless one of you wants to lose his job? Yes, you in the back!\n\n(muffled question, inaudible)\n\nOh, the salaries? You mean like the satin-deliveries you were boasting of at breakfast?

Never would the children know of Rurik and his sons, or Alexander Nevsky's victory over the Teutonic Catholics. It wasn't simply the destruction of a book. It was the obliteration of their history. Then a man from the government came. He was short, balding, and had no smile. A perfect bureaucrat and a boring human being. Yet Katerina wished she picked up that tiny man and kissed him on the spot for what news he brought. New books! Not just reprints, badly copied ones at that, but actually new books with the latest in historical efforts. And not just for history, which had been lost in the bombing, but chemistry, math, biology, and the humanities.\n\n"Come children, come!" Katerina said, clapping her hands together. "Before we start our math lesson, let's read about a great and mighty Queen, mother of Rurik's grandchild, Olga of Kiev." She tapped the edge of the book, drumming up their innocent and avid excitement before reading.\n\nLater in the day she would bore them with numbers and talking about amoebas, which would help them in the future. But the past had been kept alive. What Russia once was had been kept alive. The taxes weren't simply going to bombs or bullets or bread, but making sure they had a future.

For most of her young life, the weekly trip to the town market had been something to avoid. The shopkeepers had been hostile and the shoppers angry. Arguments over weights and prices had often turned into scary shouting matches around her.\n\nThat scary market was now firmly a thing of the past, at least to Zora. For the first time she could remember, basic goods were plentiful. There were more smiles to be seen, fewer arguments, and most importantly, a plethora of new faces, stalls and goods on offer. It seemed every market day there was something new to see, smell or taste! The Shaurma she'd shared with her father last week still made her mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nAs they walked to the town square, she was running circles around her mother, nipping impatiently at her coat. Once the market came into view, her mother gave her a warm smile and a small coin. "Run along, Alsu, and enjoy yourself. Find me in front of old Mustafaev's stall in an hour's time." The words had barely left her mouth before the girl was running full sprint, off to find other excited girls and boys and to see, smell, taste and experience everything her 10 kopeks could buy."

The first half hour now spent making assurances that the failure to produce a majority was not due to the electorate doing something wrong, somehow, they were starting to get somewhere.\n\n"Since no party can command the council by themselves, they will have to work together. Many cities already do this. Sometimes they have stable alliances that rule together, sometimes the largest party builds different coalitions from issue to issue. Even President Kosygin has to listen to the other parties and work with them."\n\nHe was optimistic they could do it, too.

Strenuous qualification standards, the focused attraction and repatriation of exiled and expatriate academics, and the provision of proper funding and equipment for scientific purposes, have all contributed to this.\n\nAlthough the level of the Republic's available academic offerings does not yet begin to approach that of more established localses, such as the Reich, the Sphere, or the United States, the gap is quickly closing.

Taking his placard, Valery began the twenty-minute trek to his appointed District. He had at least gotten lucky with the placing: he'd heard some volunteers would have to stay overnight thanks to the travel time back and forth. As he arrived in the little park-square, he set up his placard next to a couple of chairs with a sign hung between lamp-lights: A CONVERSATION ABOUT DEMOCRACY! ALL WELCOME!\n\nThe first to approach the improvised booth he'd set up was a pensioner, a lady in her sixties clutching a handbag. Valery helped her into the seat opposite his as she snarled at him. "Get out of my district, reactionary. This place isn't for your type and it never will be."\n\nValery simply smiled, drawing his secret weapon from his bag: a flask of tea, chilled and thoroughly stirred. "Reactionary?

Either way, we believe the many agencies we've collaborated with deserve rich praise for their conduct during this campaign, and the near 60-percent increase in voting registrations rests in no small part on their many shoulders. Special thanks go to the Mitvol family, whose invaluable help in setting up our conversational tea-booths boosted our public image immensely.

Trying to force them all into some unitary "Russian" identity, as their forebears had done, would only lead to resentment, and in the case of uniting Russia, popular resistance was an untenable prospect.\n\nOn the right were her comrades of sort, advocating the exact opposite. The task before Russia was grand; uniting a broken and disparate people against a teutonic invader. There would be no room for bickering in the unification struggle to come. The peoples of Russia had for centuries shared an identity, regardless of ethnicity, and could only restore themselves behind such a common name.\n\nUltimately, she did not feel strongly either way. This was a theoretical issue, something to be resolved when they had the luxury to do so. Much more pressing was rebuilding an economy, guarding against foreign threats, establishing control over newly acquired territories.\n\nYet still, she knew the inflammatory debate that had conspired to bring this proposal to her desk. It was the right wing that held most sway, and it was the right wing that kept her in power. In the interest of the Free Russian republic to come, many compromises would have to be made.\n\nBegrudgingly, she signed off on the right wing's proposal, authorising their blatant attempt to shape the Russian future in their image. To live in Russia was to be Russian, insignificant cultures be damned. Besides, what would matter most to the Baskirs and Tartars, bread and electricity? Or some pseudo-autonomy?"

Many centuries ago, Russia was much smaller than it was before the Great Patriotic War and the Russian Revolution. Siberia remained much of a wasteland, with few people living there. To expand the glory of the empire and spread Russian culture, the Tsars decided to settle more Russians east of the Urals. Nowadays, many Russians live in Siberia, and it is no different from Russia the further West you go. Expanding into Siberia made Russia big and strong. No one wants to be in a tiny country, do they?" The teacher paused and looked around the classroom, finding a boy with his hand up.\n\n"Teacher, what happened to the people in Siberia before we went there? Did they go somewhere else?" The boy questioned.\n\nThe teacher paused a moment, thinking. "Well, as I said, there were some people in Siberia before us. Not much changed for them though, they are still there, even in Siberia today. Back then though, many were ruled by terrible khans and suffered under raiders until Russia united them and brought them into Russia. With Russian culture, they learned to work together with each other and the new Russians." Content with her explanation, the teacher began to change the subject, then the boy spoke up once again.\n\n"Didn't they fight back though, like we fought the Germans?"\n\n"What, that's nothing like what happened at all," replied the teacher, obviously vexed by the boy. "Those are two entirely different situations. The raiders fought us of course, but they were murdering poor and innocent Russians. They had to be fought. Meanwhile, the Germans planned to exterminate all of Russia! The Germans were brutish devils while the Russians were pure saviors. Now, I don't want to hear about this any longer.

 komi_authdem.12.d:0 "Stalina sighed as she looked at the multitude of suggestions for her upcoming speech that had been thrown onto her desk. When she had thought of working to unite Russia, working to a better tomorrow for democracy, she hadn't imagined fools throwing themselves around at irrelevant issues instead of looking at the bigger picture. The biggest points of contention lately had not been of military strategy or anything that actually had any meaning. No, the bureaucrats were battling over the "Redemption of Russia". She needed to cement the state position, otherwise the Republic would still be babbling on about culture in the year 2000. Looking over suggestions for opening her speech gave her a headache. One leftist proposed the opening address to be towards "Those who reside within our controlled area of Russia". That contrasted with one man on the right who declared that she should address her speech to "The most loyal Russians of the Empire". It went on like that, paragraphs and pages on what some thought her first words should be. That didn't even brush upon the rest of the "critique" she was given. Some believed, on both sides, that how deep her voice was held the utmost importance. One concerned educator wrote in frantic pace about how speaking deep-voice would seem "Imperialistic". A miner who had learned their letters just to write to her pleaded in scrawled Russian that she acted "as a man".\n\nStalina, having wasted her night, tossed the pile to the waste basket. For this speech, she already knew the general ideas of what both sides of the party wanted. The Left, pandering to progressive causes and pluralism. The Right, lip service to a strong Russia. She weighed her options. She had little care for the actual issue, but the Right were presently a more powerful ally. It would anger the Leftists, sure, but, perhaps, that didn't quite matter all that much anyways. As long as Russia could be united under the Free Republic, it didn't matter who she stiffed.

She would take her custom-made cup (a gift from a friend) and swish the dregs of her tea as she paced the office, taking in the sheer freshness of the morning streaming in through the office windows. There was something about solitude, Ludmila felt, that made the everyday magical - it was the redeeming perk of an otherwise uneventful job.\n\nShe wondered, as she often did, what the men and women of the office did to make them stay so late. Most offices closed at 5 and opened at 8, but she'd been specified to leave the offices open till 2am. If her parents hadn't passed on a few years back she'd have refused the job outright for its late hours. Even so, she was a light sleeper.\n\nAnd sometimes files passed, here and there, without even Ludmila noticing, and some of the dossiers she managed were thick one day and thin the next. It wasn't her job to notice, and so she made an effort not to. Better to keep to silence than to risk an intrusion - or her salary.\n\nThis morning, she thought, she would make herself her favourite tea-brew. Humming a light tune, she walked to the office doors and was taken quite by surprise by the thud of gunfire.\n\nAs the noise hammered her ears, she huddled by instinct against her desk and watched her world torn asunder by burly soldiers hefting crate upon crate of files - and protesting men - out the door.

For the men and women who bothered looking at the leaflets, not much awaited them - four words, SCREENING AT TOWN CENTRE, were the only words of substance on the thin little paper-rolls.\n\nTowards noon the gathering began. Soldiers walked door to door, escorting smiling men in suits who styled themselves 'recruiters' - they sought the young men first, those who looked capable of military service but with no occupation. Then they asked for the old men, then the working-women: it appeared no part of the town was safe from their ungentle queries. Men and women were herded towards the town-square, the gaze of the soldiers around them a prod for their movements, and into an involuntary movie-theater.\n\nAs the patriotic movie was broadcast on the side of a residential building, recruiters moved amongst the ranks, reminding the gathered of their responsibilities. Their faith, their God, their families - all needed defending. All needed to be preserved. And who would go, they whispered, if not them? All that was needed would be a signature, only a signature, to help keep the Rodina safe.\n\nIf there was any doubt in the minds of those with different convictions, it was dispelled as soldiers formed barriers between the audience and the outside world.

The National Sovereignty Act - the culmination of weeks of research, drafting, and committee votes, and the greatest stride yet towards achieving the Sovereign Democratic Party's agenda of a strong, independent Russia.\n\nWithin it was everything that she had advocated for, on the campaign trail, regarding the threat of foreign imperialism and dependency. Limits on trade performed without defensive obligations, limits on debt, an increased import duty... all of it would serve towards the ultimate cause, the cause of a Russia free from threat both external and internal. A Russia which would be seen by the world as an equal power in its own right, a Russia which one day could stand alongside the United States itself as a bastion of democracy and stability.\n\nShe looked up, once more, nodding to the cameras which clustered around her desk, littered with papers. Her silver pen glided across the paper, leaving her signature on the line marked "APPROVED". The reporters clapped politely, but her focus was elsewhere, out the window.

Discussion of this topic is hereby curtailed; now, if I could invite the audience to examine page 63 of our latest Economic Budget..."\n\nWatching the sheepdogs storm out of the Chamber, Stalina felt something churn in her stomach.

Perhaps the residual unease was why receiving the news of the new Democratisation Order gave him such a wild joy - the President had been explicit in her orders, and he looked forward to retrieving his old membership rolls.

A footnote in the history books, and a milquetoast reference to extremism. Well, she'd done her best to follow in his best impression - and she'd succeeded. Her work in the Republic was safe for the time being, from enemies without and within.\n\nPerhaps this was another story she would tell herself as age descended, and perhaps she would stop believing in it altogether one day.

It was of little consequence to the advisors, and after she calmed down she was usually more amenable to discussion, even if she remained reluctant to change her views on anything. Anger was common, and easy to deal with.\n\nThis preternatural calm, however, was not. Stalina looked at the senior staff of the Economic Bureau, calm, unsmiling and totally implacable. "No, I will not. That is the end of the matter. I will not reconsider the signing of the Sovereignty Act under any circumstances." She flipped open a dossier, looking through its contents as if her staff were simply not there.\n\nOne of the advisors, a mid-level bureaucrat, made the mistake of speaking his thoughts. "President Stalina, with all due respect, the Act will cripple our economic will and devour our private industry. I have been on the phone with worried corporate clients all week."\n\nInstantly her gaze, as scorching as the sun and far less measured in its touch, was upon him. "With all due respect, I care not a whit for you or the corporate suits. My job and my heart lie with this country, and if we are to sell its treasure to those who cannot be trusted with it we may as well disband the Army and lower our banners tomorrow."\n\nShe turned to her papers with a rare vehemence.

And scheduling this goddamn idiotic march on a Friday fucking evening, of all things! Did the Colonel have his brain installed where the arsehole was meant to be?\n\nGod, it was intolerable - and the only reason why he put up with it all was because the Republican Army was still the finest pension-fund in all of the Republic. Kirov was a man of faith - he had faith only in what men could bring him, that was. And having looked through the pension plans, he knew exactly what the next few decades would bring him, assuming he lived through it all.\n\nWell, time to stop speculating on the future: the present, and his squad, awaited him.

He had to make the maps fit together, damnit, and in their proper order - there had to be some applicability of the Manual of Foreign Operational Doctrine here. What if he were to transpose that West Russian counteroffensive onto the local terrain? Specifically, the one that led through the north Urals like so - and so -\n\nThe terrain maps proved his undoing. The planned advance of the armored column would move through a valley they couldn't recon, and it was the only chokepoint for miles. No, the strategy employed by the Armored Corps wouldn't work unless they wanted to rapidly turn their finest armor into smoking junk. Nabatov sighed. How on earth could he make this offensive work in the five hours he had left?\n\nHe barely noticed the Commanding Officer approach, but he did smell the pungent cigarette fumes on his breath. "Trouble planning this? Here, try this reference - American work, British defense. Good for the terrain, armor strength parity might need a little rework though." And the CO was gone as Nabatov's eyes widened behind him.\n\nYes, he thought as he flicked through the manual. This would work. This would work! His legs turning to jelly from the exultance and stress, Nabatov scribbled a few hasty notes and rose to find the Strategic Briefing Notes. And then, for the first time in two days, he could sleep."

Strelkov, I have been working for close to a decade in the Military, and our entire operational doctrine has been configured to work with combined armor-infantry operations. The Air Force will only complicate this state of affairs by stealing resources and money from us."\n\nStrelkov kneaded his temples.

Another day in the Ministry of Defense and its assembled glories.

Poring through its conclusions, Korolkov nodded, making notes in the margins. There was plenty of work to be done to bring the military up to parity with its contemporaries, and this would definitely help.\n\nA stubble-headed member of the General Staff approached him, and Korolkov got up to show the formalities. "Stand down. I'm looking for a paperback, something to fill the gap on someone's chair. Hmm, have you seen any spare binders? Preferably something slim?

But one day the Great Fleet would rise again, and Russia would once again take to the seas: perhaps not in her lifetime, but one day...\n\nYefimova listened as the cold winds drifted about their junk, and as she grew, she learned. She taught herself knotting, sailing, drifting, using only the stars and the harsh Northern spirit for navigation, and as she grew in wisdom her fishing fleet expanded from one to a half-dozen. She had grown powerful, but when the Republican Navy had sent its letter of invitation, she knew what she had to do. A vision, after all, was worthless if not fulfilled.\n\nShe wished her father could see her now, standing upon the deck of the Republic's latest vessel. He'd always been foolish, and perhaps a little too attached to the drink at the end, but he'd never wavered, and her dreams were his dreams, too.\n\nAnd watching the flag fly above a silver-sheened ocean, gulls flying overhead as the engine whirred, Yefimova felt something in her heart glow.

Perhaps it was acceptable in Zlatoust, where standards were as low as the Altai Basin's dunes, but not here. He lowered the gun and began to pore over the blueprints scattered around him in a half-blossom.\n\nPerhaps it had been the material, or perhaps there was a structural cause in sight. The latter would explain why the soldiers on the Testing Squad had complained so bitterly about the loading and unloading drills. Something about the barrel, then - but their reports had focused on the firing-pin mechanism itself, so it couldn't possibly be that. Maybe in the way the barrel interacted with the firing pin? Yes, perhaps the explosion of the shot had cracked something within.\n\nA passing soldier yelled, "Korenev! Hard at work? It's almost lunch!" Koronev, barely looking up, greeted him and told him, in no uncertain terms, to go away. The soldier giggled as he left: it was adorable, the way Korenev was so immersed in his work he was blind to everything else. Absolutely adorable.\n\nKorenev's mind was far away, however: the rifle, as did all the equipment he'd been given, preoccupied him. Some solution needed to be found in the meantime. The barrel problem would probably need a full rework of the design, perhaps even a back to basics test. But the main problem, as he saw it, was the drooping.

It would be necessary to reconsolidate their existing assets into a single unit, and retrain them day and night until they could perform the roles they'd missed.\n\nSo the People's Hussar Division, as it was known (no one could remember the actual number and reference), was formed, and the farmers and their sons and daughters watched the tanks move row on row into distant fields, towards the base where they were to be christened in a new name and mould.\n\nThere were failures, as there always were: a few of the new models, fresh from the factory, had broken down in a muddy field, and no one was yet sure if it was equipment failure or a planning error that had brought them down. The rest of the models were dragged onto the main road and confined to purely motorized activity until something could be done with them - time would tell if they needed a rebuild or if they could serve a supplementary function in the Motorized Corps.\n\nEven so, as the base commanders noted the plates and licenses of the tanks arrayed, there was reason for celebration. This new division already had plans in the works for a full-blown multi-branch exercise, and some whispered that its commanding officer was a glory hound who would push his men to the limit.

In addition, given river and rail development, the WRFR also has economic ties to other parts of Russia, Central Asia, and regions further east. However, this nascent economy needs a boost in order to be all that it can be. Should we offer direct financial aid, investment subsidies, and perhaps R&D funding to the WRFR?

The WRFR is offering to give us basing rights at these ports, in exchange for a yearly increase to their aid funding of approximately 550 million dollars. While this sum may seem eye-popping at first, it's a rounding error for a budget as big as the USA's, and in exchange, the US Navy would have a toehold deep in the heart of Russia, within striking distance of numerous strategic targets.

Whether you produce tanks or toys, you are the ones who will be building a better Russia. Not the politicians, not the economists, but you, the worker.

The pamphlet also advertises anti-extremism and anti-radicalism, denouncing both fascism and communism. The PSD has also promised more liberal social policies, advocating for equality and liberty. Most important to the PSD however, is the reclamation of Russia. In their platform, the PSD has promised to focus efforts on reunifying the motherland, no matter the cost.

They happened to agree on some aspects of policy together, despite having vast differences. Both of them held distaste for the far-left and far-right, and both of them were elected under similar circumstances, under similar stakes. They were becoming fast friends, despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle.\n\n"So, Yevgeny. Do you really think Miss Stalina's economic recovery plan is that different from Voznesensky's?"\n\n"Voznesensky is a left-wing populist who would let Zhdanov and his goons walk over him and influence his economic policy. Stalina would never let radical leftism taint her economic policy!"\n\nBoth of them gave a small chuckle, and continued debating. They all knew it wasn't serious, and it was more to gauge their individual abilities and comfort with each other. They did sit in the same caucus after all; it wouldn't hurt to know the ideals of your ally. As the assembly began to clear out for a break, the two remained behind, still sitting together and growing ever quieter.\n\n"Hey, Elena? Why are you working with me? Doesn't Kosygin see Stalina and my party as borderline despotic?"\n\n"Well..." she said, after a pause..."

After the news of Voznesensky deciding to sideline Kosygin's coalition, many assemblymen and women walked out of the building in protest and would only return for important policy decisions. But not Elena. Despite her being rather furious, she stood her ground with very few other SMR members, those who would hopefully make their voices heard.\n\n"That disgusting, apathetic, traitorous pig! Is Voznesensky abandoning the party that won the last election with him for those dirtbag marxist-leninist zealots?"\n\nYegveny sighed, understanding her concern. "I get that, I really do. I'm sure he would've done the same to us if we were in the SMR's place, but our caucus has bigger things to focus on right now. Almost the entire SMR delegation walking out shows the others that we do not stand in solidarity with each other, and it makes us look weak."\n\nElena, now looking physically furious, began to full-on debate Yevgeny. "How could you even support anything that conniving despot says? He would throw the entire caucus under the bus to drink champagne with his party and celebrate victory while working with the very forces which want to destroy us! Let me guess, your "Woman of Steel" said it wasn't a big deal. That she would work with whatever the DSNP wants to keep her own party in the majority. We're supposed to stay true to our democratic principles!"\n\nThe rest of the Assembly looked on in intrigue, and Elena soon became part of the procession who left the building. Yevgeny sat there, somewhat upset and embarrassed, but silently believed that she would come to her senses. She, and the rest of the SMR, had to. For if they didn't, our democracy would die."

Cheers, handshakes, and applause roared throughout the assembly; Elena and Yevgeny included.\n\n"I'm not too partial on Kosygin's approach to reconciliation with the radicals and military policy."\n\n"And I'm not too happy about Stalina dodging questions about gerrymandering, but we're still here, no?"\n\nYevgeny nodded, and a smile formed on both of their faces. Their friendly debates and mutual agreements finally came in handy today. When discussing law and order policies, Elena's defense of PSD's actions managed to keep many from the SMR from walking out in protest. A mutual consensus was seemingly agreed on, one without any spoken word or initiative. The consensus of peace, the consensus of stability, and the consensus of holding true to what made our Republic special. We would never stoop to the level of the Tsar or the Marshal, we would always look to the people and the President.\n\nEven if compromises had to be made, our coalition and system would survive."

"They'd refuse to work with you, and potentially the rest of the SMR. Maybe they'd witch hunt out anyone like you. It would all be for naught..."\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door, and a distant Yevgeny approaching her with some papers. In a panic, she knocked her diary to the floor, but accidentally spilled her tea along with it.\n\n"Goodness, are you okay?" Yevgeny said, walking toward her with caution.\n\n"No, Yevgeny. No I'm not."\n\nYevgeny helped Elena clean up, and then sat down with her. She spoke softly, and quietly, and said something which made his eyebrows raise.\n\n"I was... A follower of them before. I was an ardent socialist once. To think that if nutjobs like Zhdanov weren't in the party, I would've stayed. I'm just scared that someone will find out now that we're taking the fight to them."\n\nYevgeny, standing up, put his hand on Elena's shoulder supportively and smiled. "That's in the past now, no? We're fighting them now, and that's what matters. Who better to beat them than a former supporter?" She smiled, politely nodded, and thanked him.

Among other initiatives to strengthen the power of the Center came Elena and Yevgeny, as they were a few months ago, analyzing key issues together. Combined in one of the Assembly building's offices, they gathered other like-minded members of the Center and gathered all evidence, notes, and observations they have about the political situation in Komi.\n\n"The left is divided between "reformist" and "orthodox" lines, with yet another division in their orthodox caucus." Elena presented.\n\n"Furthermore, the right is extremely ideologically fragmented as well. Fascists, Eurasianists, Shafarevichites, and Monarchists do not mix well." Yevgeny added. "We're convinced that the Center has the greatest chance for unity and the greatest chance to appeal to the common voter, despite the obstacles we may face."\n\n"Like what? What's an obstacle which could possibly be holding us back?" Elena eyed Yevgeny, and the two nodded at each other. They were ready for this. They've seen and known it since day one.

Not anymore, but God forbid they found out. They'd sweep the entire PSD under the rug as despots and fascist sympathizers in disguise." Yegveny thought to himself deeply, looking at the stars forming in the night sky.\n\n"Hey, Yevgeny!" He panicked, dropping his cigarette and matchbox into the street below, and turning around to see Elena. "I came here to drop off some papers to you. You don't look so well though. Should I come back later, or..?"\n\nThe two of them talked for what seemed like hours, despite being only a few short minutes. "Elena, I have to come clean. I was a card-carrying member of them once. The Passionariyy. To think I only spent some years off the street beating our political opponents... I don't want to be reminded of it, and I'm terrified of what they'd do to me if they found out."\n\nElena sighed, and sat down on his desk, with her arm extended to move his face to look at her. "Yevgeny, it's okay. I don't care what you did back then. You're a good person now, and you're going to help us put a nail in their coffin for good.

komi_friendship.8.d:0 "After much debate in another closed meeting of the Assembly, many agreed that Stalina was the best shot at curbing radical leftist influence. A stalwart anti-extremist, more so than any other democratic leader at the moment, the government passed a motion of support in favor of her to enact some of her plans in order to protect the Center from the Left. While the entirety of the PSD is overjoyed right now, the largest majority of NO votes came from the SMR. Elena was the only member of the SMR who abstained, and wasn't too excited about the following resolution.\n\n"Hey, Elena. The vote's got you down, no?" Yegveny was standing over her seat, coming over from the delegation of PSD members.\n\n"I don't want to talk about it right now. I never thought we would get behind her policies like that, even if it's for the good of the Republic..."\n\nYevgeny sat down beside her, and much like how she confided in him, he began to confide in her. "I would've done the exact same you were doing right now if Kosygin was Stalina. I know you're reluctant to vote for someone you disagree with. She may be the Woman of Steel, and she may not be the most liberal, but we have to remember that we're in this together. You won't be a deviant for bending your values a bit, especially if it's only for now. The PSD and DSNP will all go together to the polls, and we don't want the SMR to have doubts. Especially not me."\n\nWith a sigh, she nodded. "I'll consider supporting her agenda in the future. I suppose I owe you for this one, friend.""

komi_friendship.9.d:0 ""Heartless traitors!"\n\nYevgeny's words rang out with stinging barbs. "How dare you ignore our calls for unity and belief in Stalina to curb these dangerous radicals? Are you really willing to put your own partisan politics over the sanctity of our democratic process and protection of it from subverters?" In a heated assembly meeting, many members of the PSD, including a very vocal Yegveny, are furious about the recent direction the government has taken. To them, Stalina was a woman of steel, with a plan of iron and a will of titanium. Now, she and her party were embarrassed and sidelined. Voznesensky's harsh dismissal of her plan has caused more harm than good, it seems.\n\nThe PSD is fracturing the democratic Center. While all members of the PSD seemed to agree with Yevgeny's talking points, other democratic members of the assembly simply watched in shock. Jeers from the right and left energized their own platforms; further lowering the morale of the Center. When all hope seemed to be lost, a single voice was raised in the assembly.\n\n"Yevgeny, you promised to help us... what are you going to do now? We said we would defend democracy together!" Elena, almost on the verge of a breakdown, stood up valiantly and finally had the courage to confront her friendly rival on the Assembly floor.\n\nAfter silence and a sigh, he finally spoke. "I'm going to accept the results of the election, regardless. I have no faith in a system that sidelines their own allies for meaningless favors." With his statement, the Center remained quiet.

There would be a future for the people of Komi which wasn't one which would bend too far to either side.\n\n"So..." She began. "How does it feel to be headed into this election as one, partner?"\n\nYevgeny looked to his side, eyeing the smiling Elena next to him. "Partner? I'm more partial to the use of colleague, but go off, I suppose."\n\nThe two share a brief laugh, before continuing to walk to their homes. "Not everyone will be happy when it comes time to cast our ballots, that's for sure. But, at the same time, I'm okay with it. And hopefully you are too." Elena nodded.\n\n"You know, I never understood Stalina's fascination with paternalism. Could you explain it again?" Once again, the two of them were locked in a fierce, but friendly debate, one that would continue until they reached their homes. Regardless, when they parted ways, they were both accepting of the overall motions that the political system was going through.

Whoever this person was, they were becoming a clearer and more present threat to the now weakened Right and fragile Center.\n\n"We believe we may have a lead on who this figure is." The room goes silent, as another assemblyman passes around a dossier to the members of the meeting. "Bukharin's daughter. While heaven knows if her old man is still alive, the name alone carries intense weight for all of us; especially the voters."\n\nElena turns to Yevgeny, and she begins to whisper. "Stalina. Not yours, though. I've heard rumors of her. Didn't even think she was a real person..."\n\n"She's one of those populist types. If she comes around and charms over some of the left's voter base, a good fight will be had."\n\nWith a strict ahem from the orating assemblyman, the two quiet down and listen.

Deputy Kosygin would be a safe, sane choice for a healthy democratic Komi, and perhaps with time, Russia as a whole. In a region and world so corrupted by undemocratic tyrants, the policies of Deputy Kosygin would be the light shining against the darkness."\n\n"...I speak for many of us when I say that Stalina is a bulwark. She will protect your rights, your freedoms, and this country from radicals. No other candidate is as crucial to ensuring a safe and just democratic process as she is. I promise she will never let you, nor the people of Komi, down!"\n\nBoth finished their speeches to respective cheers and boos. As they both sat down in their seats, they gave each other the same look they once did a year ago. Whatever the result would be, they were in this together, and spoke their minds as anyone should."

He thought of him as a misguided idealogue.\n\n"Now what?" Elena sighed, rubbing her temples and closing her eyes. "Neither of us want to stand up for that racist bastard, but do we have another choice?"\n\n"I didn't come this far over a year to quit now. You don't care about how we got here, and neither do I. But this is the hand we've been dealt. There's too much at stake to not play it."\n\n"I... Suppose you're right. It's just disappointing to have it come down to this."\n\nThe two walked briskly in silence. Yevgeny's hands were sternly clasped in his pockets, gripping an anger that wasn't entirely there. For once, they were lost. Yet, despite it all, both of them seem to agree on one last thing..."

Elena tried to console her colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on him. Much like the Woman of Steel herself, Yegveny was seemingly dead-set on his iron-willed ideals.\n\nThat is, until he stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep inhale, he released the tension in his body, and turned to face Elena. "It's no big deal. I know we were upset during the nomination, but I want to talk to some of them. Tell them that there's still hope. We may not be the happiest, but we're willing to hold on much the same. Even with Kosygin."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, he crosses the busy street.

She was seemingly unmoving and uncompromising in her direction.\n\nThat is, until she stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep exhale, she released the tension in her body, and turned to face Yevgeny. "No matter, I suppose.

With the clink of two glasses, both assembly members take the first few sips of their drinks. Yevgeny coughs a bit, but with a cheerful expression. Elena simply sits calmly and downs her liquor, the bitterness trapping her tongue. Vodka, above all else, was more than just cheap entertainment and a staple of the Anarchic diet. It was a truth-sealer. "I didn't think we'd get this far without being shot, honestly."\n\n"Oh, nonsense! If you keep thinking like that, Elena, I'd be surprised if you don't drop dead from this vodka." Holding in their laughter, the two finally break and chuckle childishly. Perhaps in the past year, they would never expose this laid-back attitude to one another. Political enemies. PSD dog. SMR freeloader. All of that distrust and hatred disappeared with a few sips.\n\nAfter sitting silently for a while and drinking a bit more, Yevgeny pushes his drink to the side and faces his friend. "Hey, Elena? Promise me something over one more drink, eh?"\n\n"What's the matter? About to tell me your life story?"\n\n"Nah, this is way better. You and me, no matter what happens tomorrow... I want us to stick together. We came this far to protect our democracy. I don't want to jeer at your side of the aisle again."\n\nAlthough originally taken off guard, she nods intently and offers her hand. "Shake on it. For life."

Was the Center not united enough? Perhaps the extremists gained too much strength? Whatever the case was, both of them have been drafted to serve under an emergency government under [NIK.GetLeader].

Their heads hurt, their hands were weary, and they felt that something was incredibly, incredibly amiss.\n\nWith a motion of one of the commissars, all of the bags were removed. Elena and Yevgeny looked around them, seeing fellow members of the Center, tied up with them as prisoners. Communist partisans and soldiers were armed, rounding up members of the democratic opposition. "Listen closely! Everyone here is considered a traitor to the Komi Provisional Soviet. You will now be tried against a People's Commissariat for crimes against our glorious revolution. How do you plead?"\n\n"Not Guilty!" Elena and Yevgeny shouted in unison. Deep down, they held onto some youthful hope that they had a chance. However, as the trial went on, as the commissars spoke, and as several assemblymen were taken away around them, it became clear that this was a show trial. This was the end. Meaningless words, piercing their defenses like tank shells, rallying the super-partisan council of judges assembled against them. They would certainly meet their deaths. However the communists decided to do it, however, was what occupied their minds.\n\n"What are you going to do to us? We did nothing wro--"\n\n"GUILTY!

Good men died to prevent this. Worse men fought to reduce it to ash.\n\nYevgeny coughed heavily, a stray bullet still lodged in his lung. The clenched hand grasping at his gunshot wound was becoming weaker by the second. He didn't believe that he would die here. Not in some run-down records room, slumped over against a table with one of his former enemies at his side. The pistol on the ground was empty, much like the air in his body. Perhaps, if there were still some bullets left, they could fight. One last, desperate clawing attempt for liberation. Perhaps they could end their life. Surely, whatever the fascists did to them would be worse than death.\n\n"We promised... And we failed."\n\nAs Yevgeny became closer to death, the door to the record room was slammed open with a kick. A member of the fascist paramilitary, with the raise of his PPSh, filled the duo with bullets and added to brass piles on the floor. After a quick look around the room, he looks down at the victims.

Every hour, every drop of sweat, and every inch of ground held led to eternal peace. It was worth it, for all of them. For all of us.\n\n"So... friends? Or are we back to foes across the aisle?"\n\n"Friends. Without people like you, even if you are not entirely with me, matter. We promised, after all." The two nod, and shake hands.
